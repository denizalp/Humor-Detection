Akin to the traditional Italian Bakeries I grew up on in Vaughan and Richmond Hill, this spot is a cornerstone in the Etobicoke neighbourhood of Mimico! \n\nLocated just south of The Gardiner on Royal York (NB: you cannot access RY from Gardiner so get off at Kipling or Islington, head south to Evans Ave and take that East to Royal York before going south).\n\nI used to work a few blocks away and SanRemo was always the place to go for lunch - and I mean that for EVERYONE. Come at lunch and be prepared to face long line ups, however the staff here have this place humming like a well oiled machine and these lines get dealt with lickity-split!\n\nMy most recent visit was to stop in for an Espresso and a Zeppole as I'd heard their Zeppole was tops. Much to my disappointment when I arrived my friend and I discovered that they had stopped making them as of March 31st. I thought it was common practice to make them until Easter, no? To add insult to injury the Eastern european woman manning the dessert counter was snippy when I inquired, as if she had been asked 1 Million times that day about the Zeppole. I'm sorry if I was 1 million and 1 but some civility and even a fake apology would have made me feel less bad about missing out. Next time how bout a smile sweetheart? OK, Thanks - remember that say about attracting flies with honey....\n\nAnyway, enough about the UNPLEASANT and more about what became known as \"the back up plan\" for my visit. Lunch, Espresso and one of San Remo's famed doughnuts! \n\nFor lunch I went for the Veal lunch special which included, Veal with all toppings, on a bun with a drink and salad. I think it was about $9.99 +tax (but I feel as if It may have been more). They make a phenomenal veal sangwich, not the best, but definitely top 3-5 in my life, and I'm a man who knows his fatina, (Italian for veal).\n\nNew espresso machines recently brought in served up excellent espresso shots which had the perfect amount of creama on top to support a healthy portion of sugar (side note, I always pretend the sugar is sinking ship as I watch it eventually fall into the coffee darkness below the surface).\n\nAnd last. But not. Least. The doughnut. Long had I heard about them but seldom had remembered to have one. At lunch there were still 8 shelves of doughnuts FULL, so don't get angry at these guys for selling out if you're there late in the day, by lunch there was more on display then at Timmies! I had the Nutella doughnut which was perfectly cooked, huge, puffy cake, topped with a swirl of nutella and powdered sugar and filled with a healthy amount of sweet chocolate filling! Delicious. A standard doughnut but done exceptionally well. \n\nWith the quality of the food here, I'm scared that this is my local Italian bakery now - I predict many more trips for espresso, doughnuts, veal and well everything else they carry! Just need a little shine on that customer service and that should earn you that 5th star!\n\nEatcrest Out!
