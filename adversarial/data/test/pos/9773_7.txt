Heard about the place and decided to give it a try.\n\nI went for the Meat Tornado. Choice of beef or pork weiners. Sliced Philly steak, crispy bacon bits, a fried egg and their special sauce. Delectable.\n\nThey were just voted as having Montreal's best poutine, so I'm definitely coming back to try that.\n\nThey also have plans to start franchising, both here and in the US. So expect to see one near you in the future.
