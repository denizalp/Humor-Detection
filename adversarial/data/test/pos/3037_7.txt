Okay, I'm not going to pretend like I'm a huge expert when it comes to these escape rooms (this was only my third one) but I will say this is one of the better ones I've been to, and probably the most interesting in terms of the theme, decor, etc. As an example, and I hope I'm not giving away too much here, but my friends and I tried the Ancient Pyramid room and there was real sand in the room, which was pretty cool! \n\nThe room we did was pretty challenging, and unfortunately we didn't pass. :( It wasn't like unreasonably challening though, so I thought the tasks we had to do were pretty fair.\n\nIt's a little pricier than other places, around $25 after tax, and this is after we got a 20% discount for liking their FB page and also for a holiday promo. I guess it is worth it for the experience though, since it's not like this is just some tiny room in a basement or anything. The rooms are quite big, and ours was actually three rooms connected together. The staff at Trapped were also great, and were all very friendly and cheerful. They also give you a free drink (water and pop) after your game session! \n\nI would definitely return to try one of their other rooms! Apparently they also update their rooms every few months with new tasks, which is good because then you can come back and redo the same theme but have a totally different experience!
