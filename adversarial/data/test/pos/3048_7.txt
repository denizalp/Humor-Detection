I have been waiting for this place to open, but when I left I was really disappointed. I spent 42.00 on a smoothie, 2 drinks and truffles. The smoothie was delicious. The truffles were absolutely horrible. Then I got two drinks the unicorns blood and a green one and they are absolutely disgusting I and so disappointed because they were way over priced but I chose to try them anyway. The staff was extremely wonderful and helpful while I was there. It is the drinks and dessert I disliked.
