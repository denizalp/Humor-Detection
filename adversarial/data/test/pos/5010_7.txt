Came here again for dinner and it was superb\n\nGot the duck dish and sampled portions from the chicken and salmon. The chicken was all right, the duck decent, but let me tell you, the salmon was AMAZZZING!. I've never had salmon prepared so perfectly before, very moist on the inside with a perfect amount of crispness to it on the outside. It was definitely delicious. And the sauce?  I caught my friend sopping up the sauces with the bread cause it was so delicious.\n\nTypically I don't like to return to the same restaurants in Vegas because there is such a wide selection, but I definitely will be returning to this one! Oh and a big thanks to my  yelp friend Vinh H. who treated. Gotta love a friend that is generous!\n\nAnother note: We had asked if they had flavored butter, and the waiter joked that the butter was already flavored. I thought he was only joking, but he was right! Very nice intense butter flavor, only good quality butter tastes like this!\n\nGood quality food from a very fine establishment!
