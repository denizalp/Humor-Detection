TJ's is my favorite place to buy food-groceries, snacks, essentials-they have it all.  Their food is non-GMO and made with quality, healthy ingredients.  Their prices are always low and we have switched from Fry's or Walmart for groceries to mostly TJ's and the prices are consistently better without gimmick sales and ad match games.\n\nI prefer the Surprise location because it's closer to home and it's much larger.  Plus the people are much friendlier.  This location has some weird ladies running checkouts that talk your ear off or talk to each other the whole time they're ringing you up.  It's unprofessional and annoying.  I only stop by this one for quick things I need if I'm in the area.\n\nI LOVE TRADER JOE'S!
