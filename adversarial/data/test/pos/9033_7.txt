This place has the nuttiest lady-came here to see if anyone had the same experience with worst customer sales person ever! It was an SNL skit! She calls herself a nutrionist and throws out random words shes heard of, None of which makes sense. Apparently my medication's all wrong, I know nothing about my own health and JUPITER, Mars and Mercury's alignment are why I have health issues! will never step foot in there again.hostage for 30 minutes! All I wanted was protein powder. left w\/o buying bc it was all too looney toons. Will never step foot in here again. Go to another location- trust me!!!
