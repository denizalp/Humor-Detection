BOTTOM LINE: VISIT ON MONDAY MORNING \n\nCame here for my free coffee on Monday and used the drive thru. The man who took my order was very nice and indulged my questions. The girl at the window was also very nice and efficient.\n\nNow, it's just a few days later and I decided to indulge in a breakfast sandwich and hash browns. This visit was very different from my first visit. The girl who took my order seemed a little preoccupied but finally got my order right. The girl at the window had a \"don't bother me\" look on her face, barely said 2 words to me, didn't appear to count how much money I gave her and did not tell me how much money I owed. Good thing the little outdoor display screen worked. Otherwise, we would both have just sat their staring at each other.\n\nMy thought is the folks staffed toy did NOT have their coffee yet. I will stick with Mondays from now on.
