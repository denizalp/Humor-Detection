I spilled some juice on my laptop and decided to look on yelp for a reliable repair shop based on reviews.  I chose this place and gave them a call.  You know how you can meet some people and get a feeling that you can immediately trust them.  I knew going in that it was a 50\/50 chance that my computer could be saved.  Robert was honest up front and gave me more than a reasonable price to check it and and try to repair it.  In the end I had to buy a new laptop because the old one could not be saved but they were able transfer my files from the old computer to the new one.  I know if I have anymore problems in the future this is my go to place.
