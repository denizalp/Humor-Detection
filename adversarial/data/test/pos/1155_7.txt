No Bueno, so many rules to their \"girls night\" it definitely didn't get me... Obviously I'm not a woman but coming as a guest with my girly it did not satisfy me as a guest of a woman.  \n\nI would rather be at a hole in the wall where I would still get attention from the bartender. The bartenders take FOREVER to get to you, and music is far too loud.  Say what you want music can be too loud (especially shitty radio music) \n\nMany more bars\/ hangouts I'd rather go to, or just stay at home for free beer that way
