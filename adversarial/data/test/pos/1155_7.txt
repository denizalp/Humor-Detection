Whyyyyy was I so hungover when I came here?!?! Such a waste. But it was so good....\n\nI liked all the random things that came in the mini metal pots. Can't remember what they were now but I know they all had such unique flavor. I wish they had more shellfish to choose from but the mussels were pretty good.\n\nMy #1 recommended thing to eat here... ICE CREAM. I got the mint and the mango and oh my goddddd I wanted to eat 10 scoops.
