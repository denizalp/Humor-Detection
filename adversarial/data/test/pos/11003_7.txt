Well well well so this is how the cake boss rolls...with a huge bank roll because his prices are outrageous! \n\nOk so I'm on the fence about this one. I mean don't get me wrong most of their desserts are pretty good but I'm not sure if it's worth paying an arm and a leg just for everyday sweet treats.\n\nThe whole cakes are priced not bad for a whole cake at a specialty bakery will cost you about $35 plus and theirs were about that price which is fair but stuff like their mini cakes that's like 2 bites costing almost $10 bucks is a bit crazy to me. \n\nThe cannoli cake was ok but nothing to jump up and down for. Their tarts are good but again $4 bucks for one small bite is kindda cray cray. So if you want to buy these bake goods for their name then just expect to pay the high dollars. Otherwise I think if it wasn't for the name I would find a better bakery!
