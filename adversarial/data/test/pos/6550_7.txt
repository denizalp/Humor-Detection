Once again I found myself in Nerdvana for the 2013 Expo.  I was scared by ogres, turned on by the Lara Crofts and generally confused by many of the costumes that graced this year's expo, but in a good way.  \n\nThe organizers, if they were the same from last year, decided to organize an expo this year instead of the cluster&^*% that was 2012.  Photo ops now took place in another building (the Big Four) and you could get your access bands the day before.  I wasn't a fan of keeping the goofy orange wristband on for 3 days (Taking it off damages it and they wont let \"tampered\" bands in for some stupid reason) but I dealt with it.\n\nThis year, the lines for the ATMs were shorter likely because they all actually seemed to work, and the media areas seemed much more open with more room to move.  The autographs were still expensive, but I finally stood in line and got to meet Stan Lee.  To say the least I was stunned like a teenage girl at a Zac Efron concert and could barely squeak out \"You're awesome\" before having to move on.\n\nThe artist and vendor side was terrific, though still difficult to navigate.  A few legends were there such as Erik Larsen who did cover art for at least 100 Amazing Spider-Man comics I own (Half of which I brought with me for him to sign) and World War Hulk cover artist David Finch.  Both are incredibly talented and were very friendly folks.  The vendors were many, and all had me drooling over key issues I'd die for, though most were extremely overpriced.  I did end up buying a novelty item for my gleeful nerd love and now proudly own a TARDIS & Dalek salt and pepper shaker.  Don't even pretend you aren't jealous Doctor Who fans.\n\nOverall, I had a blast and am happy to see that the folks learned from last year's mess and were able to organize quite a bit better this year.  Next year, I'm going to splurge for the VIP pass.  I'm too manly and awesome to wait in lines.
