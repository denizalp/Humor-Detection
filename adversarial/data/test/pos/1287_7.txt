Awtash Cafe really so different from the places I usually frequent! \n\nYes I love this sexy vibes of this place. And when it is dark, everyone looks 100% more sexy and good looking... (BTW, sucks if you want to take good photos!) \n\nJust love those loungers... Really want to take off my shoes and just laid there.. (I really did take off my shoes!) \n\nNahna Muddled Mint Tea\/Saffron Ice Cream with Faloodeh \n- Tea has been sweetened with syrup already so no other sweetener is necessary for me to enhanced the taste \n- My first experience with Faloodeh... A-OK... I might have to try some more in the future (My friend ate most of it...)\n\nSheesha (Blueberry\/Double Apple) \n- Hey I think they are playing a practical joke on me or something.. I was given a default hookah and doesn't matter how hard I suck.. until my face was red..nothing happened! At first I thought my lungs were defective! \n- I find smoking sheesha a relaxing and social experience.. inhale 1-2-3-4, and exhale and look at the smoke coming out...... \n- Blueberry tasted much better than Double Apple.... and some other people wants to steal mine because they like my flavour more! \n\nNow if I can wear some relax clothings and laid on the coach... hmmmm that will be some really smoking, sexy experience! :P CHILL!
