***UPDATE****\n\nThis restaurant is so scummy, that the owners wrote a five star review of the restaurant on Yelp and tried to pass it off as a customer. The review has since been flagged and removed\n\n********************\n\n\nI had quite possibly the worst experience of my life at this place.\n\nWe tried to host an engagement party at Spacco. We called in advance to ask they set aside an area for 30-40 of our friends. When we arrived, they told us no area was set aside, and one of the bartenders started laughing at us mocking us that we wanted an area set aside at a bar. Eventually they set aside four chairs and one table for our friends and told us to have our friends congregate around and leave their jackets on the the chairs at the table.\n\nOne hour later the waitress for the table came up to my fiancee and called her a f**** bitch for using the table as a coat area. My fiancee responded by telling her this is what the staff had told us to do, and by this point it would be impossible to go find each person individually and have them move their coat.\n\nThe owner then came up and placed his hands on her back and started yelling at my fiancee. The owner told off my fiancee for this coat problem. My fiancee ignored him because he was being so rude. The owner then yelled at her to leave. I came up and tried to explain to the owner that this whole situation was his own staffs fault. The owner proceeded to just scream and yell at us, so we had all our friends simply walk out of the bar.\n\nThe owner is an abusive, arrogant, prick on a power trip because he owns a bar, and his entire staff treat their customers with no respect.\n\nDo not go here.
