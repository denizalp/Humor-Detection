Was here about 6:20 pm on Sun\/14 Sep with my NorCal buddy:\n- The UYE game night already started so we decided to sit at a separate table (that's what we get for being on Asian time).\n- Had the large Iced Lychee Green Tea, tasty but really sweet.  Think I'll go with unsweetened green tea time.\n- We chatted with the servers Kristal & Ellen, both personable and customer service was spot on.  Also met briefly CD, the cafe's prioprietor, cool guy.\n- The place has been open about 7 months but now that I've confirmed it's a great hang-out spot (& I'm within walking distance), I'll be back many times more.
