This was an AXE-ellent event!\n\nThis was my first time axe throwing, so I wasn't really sure what to expect, but it was really fun! \n\nThe staff was enthusiastic and really informative. They were also around and attentive to answer any questions and to ensure our safety. Our group's instructor, \"Your Axellency\", was great. He made sure we were using the best technique and made sure we all made a shot onto the board during our practice rounds.\n\nIt would be a great place for a group get together or company event. There's even a league if you really wanted to get into it on a regular basis. \n\nIt's a nice touch that you can bring your own beer too!
