Doh!   I was hoping I had made a rash decision with my first failure here.  So I called again yesterday and I was put on hold FOREVER.  What is the secret password for someone to help a customer?  Do I need to \"know someone\" to be treated like a  human?  Come on, is there a poker game going on in the back because clearly they have no need for new customers.
