We visit the D a lot. They are one of 4 casinos in Vegas with Sigma Derby horse racing and I absolutely love that game. The fact they are on Fremont st and have that game was the only reason I choose it.\n\nWe came down Sunday, caught a very family friendly show that keep you laughing for most of the hour. For two adults used to the seedy underbelly of Vegas shows Mr. London kept us entertained. If we were entertaining friends with children, we'd go back. \n\nDrink service was weak. We hardly saw a waitress while we were there and then it took forever for them to return with a drink. They could have doubled the wait staff and everyone would have been happy with their tip totals. I promise you the servers would have been happy sharing.\n\nThe slots were paying out. The sigma derby game was fun but there were a lot of 20 yr olds sitting there not playing. You should have seen the argument I got in when I asked one to move so I could play my quarters. Yes I said quarters, save your change people.\n\nIf you stay there and they ask you a high or low floor always go low! I know that seems odd as you want a view but the elevators suck sweaty monkey balls. It took over 20 minutes to go up to the 19th floor. 35+ mins coming down. \n\nWe won't make that mistake twice. Also you don't want Fremont st adjacent. The street noise even 19 stories up is deafening.
