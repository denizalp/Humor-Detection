I have been spending more time here than at home, because it is where my friends live, and I often spend the night. This is physically a beautiful complex, nicely tucked in off S. Dorsey. The layout is neat, and the location is ideal... love the many trees, and how isolated it is from the busy surroundings of Tempe. So why the 2 stars? It is like an attractive person with an ugly personality. \n\nEvery Monday, bright and early at around 7:30 AM, the landscaping crew does their thing. By their thing, I mean they have about 10 leaf blowers cranked up to full blast for hours. Wherever you are in the complex they will be blasting away right in front of your window. It is absolutely impossible to sleep through.\n\nI have a very demanding job, and the mornings are tough. I need to do what normal people do like shower, brush my teeth, and eat breakfast. At least on 10 separate morning occasions this year, we could not help but notice that the water was randomly turned off for a few hours (and yes, the water bill was up to date). It is quite tricky to get off to a decent start without water.  \n\nIf you live on the first floor, you will most likely hear some footsteps from the people walking around above you. A few bikes, including mine got stolen recently... but they graciously left us all with front tires.\n\nThe complex could be pretty chill, it does shine when all is smooth. Hopefully the management can up their game.
