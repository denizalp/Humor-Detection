Order the Chicken and Waffles. \"Oh that's like Lo-Lo's.\" No it's not. Stop that right now.\n\nLo-Lo's:Daily Dose = McDonalds:Delux burger. Are both popular? Yes.  Are both selling the same variety of food? Yes. Is the dish at the first establishment consistently better only if the consumer is 100% stoned? Yes. Similarities end there.\n\nThese waffles are actually a cornbread hybrid, topped with green chili, shredded chicken, charred corn stew, a cream sauce, tortilla strips and avocado. (Thank you pagan god of soul food. Thank you.)
