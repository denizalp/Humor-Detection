YES YES YES.\n\nI came here monday morning around 2pm, its still morning right? (It was Labour day, so technically it's considered a Sunday morning)\n\nAnyways, we stumbled over her from church and jarvis looking for some noms. \n\nThis place is like directly behind the subway station.\n\nSo first thoughts, right off the bat...everything was diiiiiiiiiiirt cheap. Like. I didn't see anything over 10 dollars.\n\nWe had:\n\n1. The Classic Breakfast - not what I had, but my friends did and said everything was amazing. It looked good, and was served 2 eggs with protien choice, and fries + small salad + toast. Not bad.\n\n2. The Stuffed French Toast - so good. Again, served with Fries + salad.\n\n3. The Avocado and Brie sandwich - I didn't even know about it until after because my friend basically huffed it. \n\nNotes:\n\nThe gave me mayo in a squeeze bottle. MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.\n\nThe breakfast (all day) is like 6 bux. Like for real real, not for play play.\n\nThe fries are like basic shoe string, but fuck, SHOE STRING ARE MY FAVOURITE.\n\nThere were like half busy, and everyone looked like they had come for the hangover breakfast.\n\n\n\nThis place is defo my new hangover breakfast spot.\n\n\nPS MAYO IN A FREAKING SQUEEZE BOTTLE.
