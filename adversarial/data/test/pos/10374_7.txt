DENG! I did not realize I have not yet written a review of this place! It is definitely one of my favorite sushi spots because: 1) It is open late (until 3am), 2) the baked green mussels, and 3) I LOVE AYCE SUSHI! (AYCE Dinner is $24.99!... HELLA GOOD!)\n\nAs of lately, whenever I get that sushi craving, I always end up here. I don't know if it's in my comfort zone, or if the UNIVERSE gave me some form of GRAVITATIONAL PULL to Sushi Kaya, but I'm all in!\n\nSince I first started coming, there has been an increase in customers. There is always a waiting list for seating, and they even opened up a smaller room for customers! To avoid the line, I suggest sitting at the bar. We got in there in 5 minutes! =)\n\nSome of my favorite things that they offer are: (I mean I love the entire menu, but I do have my favorites. Don't we all?)\n-Green Baked Mussels: My all time favorite! They, hands down, have the all-time best baked mussels in my book!\n-Japanese Lasagna roll: Okay. Guilty. I just love baked sushi rolls! & Japanese Lasagna never fails me anywhere!\n-Japanese Pizza: This is also baked, hehe! This isn't a roll, more like a Japanese pizza on a tortilla. Delicious!\n-Salmon Skin Salad: You must try this! The salmon skin is fried and crunchy, in salad, and drizzled in this zesty dressing.\n-Sexy Roll: Loved this! It had a little crunch to it, plus I love rolls drizzled in sauces. Lol.\n-Super White Tuna Nigiri: Gotta have it at all times!\n\nOkay, I can seriously go on and on and talk about every single thing on the menu, but these are some of MY FAVES!\n\nAs for the service, It was good. Our server was Super Nice! I'm sad I didn't get her name though, because I believe she has been my server twice already.\n\nIf you haven't already, have a go at some GOOD SUSHI, try something new, and ENJOY!
