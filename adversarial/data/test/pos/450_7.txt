Besides the copious amount of alcohol I consumed during my recent Las Vegas trip, The Fudgery also contributed greatly to my weight gain. Upon walking in you are immediately surrounded by the delicious aroma of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. I told the lady I had died and gone to heaven. She immediately blessed me with several samples of the varieties of fudge: cookies and cream, chocolate chocolate, chocolate with nuts ... all were amazing. She told me that the fudge does not melt until the temperature reaches 110 degrees. I was not sure I believed her but decided that before the temperature rose that day, I would have consumed all the fudge anyway. It is pricey. Each slice is 1\/2 pound and it is 7.99 for 1\/2 a pound. I purchased one. Then my daughter conveniently wandered in and so I bought another. Then the lady told me that I got one free. Like I needed it but I wanted it. So we walked out with three. One disappeared before we arrived at our hotel. The others traveled with us and as the weather became sunnier and warmer, I was concerned about my candies. I felt the package and they were as firm (shush...) as they were when I bought them. The lady had also told us that this was the only fudge that did not hurt her stomach. As I have experienced the aches and pains of too much chocolate, I was intrigued. Considering how much fudge I ate, she was indeed correct. I loved this place but am happy there is not one around here only because it would be my demise.
