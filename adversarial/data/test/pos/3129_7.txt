So disappointed. ..we came to Lure Bistro to celebrate a special occasion and since it was a pleasant evening sat on the patio. Imagine our SHOCK and disgust as the people seated near us were SMOKING! When we inquired as to whether this was within the parameters of the \"no smoking in a place of employment law\" we were told it was. Regardless we will not be back...smoke and seafood just don't mix.
