Oh em jay! Did you see how I did that! This show is by far the best Cirque de Soleil show ever. If you are a MJ fan you must see this show! Everything about this show is just amazing. The tickets are pricey, ours were about 150\/person but it's really worth it. At the bed of the show there is a hologram of MJ and you really feel like you are at an MJ concert. \n\nThe music was great and although our seats were so close we could see some mistakes the acrobats made it was still an off the chart amazing show. \n\nAfter a while all cirque de soleil show are the same but this one memorable due to MJ theme. I really love MJ so I truly loved this show. I recommend it and I wouldn't be opposed to seeing it again.
