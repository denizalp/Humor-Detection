I always try to wait a few weeks\/months before writing a review on a business where follow up and quality of the work long term matters.  With that said BMW Only is the ONLY repair shop I would ever bring my 7 Series to in the future.  Victor and the crew are honest, fairly priced, hard working and just really the type of guys you want to help. I can not count the amount of money Victor saved me.....  Oh wait I actually can - BMW wanted $2200 for something that BMW Only did for under $700 and another item BMW wanted $400+ for and Victor did for less than $150 and so on and so on.......... I trust Victor 100% and in my life you earn my trust and it is hard to get, so he must have done a ton right to get that trust.... DO NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE...... One thing I will mention is the shop\/waiting area is NOT pretty BUT who gives a S#!t when the work is excellent, the techs are the best and the prices are so low it is like the work is free...... Look past the fact that there isn't cappuccino and pastries in the waiting area and just spend the money you save over the life of your cars repairs on a trip to Italy to eat pastries and sip cappuccino ..........
