I've been hearing about Lorenzo's for years... It's my parents' go-to pizza place as it's close to their home.  While I've had take-out from there before, I finally had the chance to check it out first-hand to dine-in. \n I see why they love it, but I do think the 3.5 star rating on Yelp is pretty spot-on.\n\nI'm being generous with 4 stars because it's the holiday season and the food was actually pretty good. \n\nI dined with my parents, my brother, and my kids... \nWe scored a large corner booth which was perfect.  It took a very long time for anyone to acknowledge us, bring menus, water, etc... so finally I asked if we were supposed to order at the counter.  I know a few other reviewers mentioned this, and it is confusing.  After we asked, our server came to say hi and take a drink order.\n\nOur party shared a large antipasto salad, which I remembered to take a picture of and it was very good.  We waited awhile for the rest of the food to arrive and dug right in when it finally arrived, so apologies for no other pics!  We also had a large pizza, an eggplant parm (which I split with my mom), a kids spaghetti with marinara (for my daughter), and a plain cheese pizza slice (for my son).  We had to send some garlic knots back because they arrived cold, but other than that, everything was good.\n\nI would totally return, especially when in the area visiting my folks... or order takeout as well.  Thanks Lorenzo!
