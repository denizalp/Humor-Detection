I've become a regular at this Giant Eagle since moving to Avon.  It's closer and less crowded than Westlake and I don't have to worry about getting shanked and mugged like I do at the Sheffield location.  \nOne little tip: go early on Sundays.  By 2:00 their produce section is pretty much down to the bare minimum.
