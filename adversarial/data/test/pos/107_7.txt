Heaven! Just look at my pictures! 90% of our food selections were just incredible. Maybe it's the holidays.. I am not sure but this was better than our first experience. The desserts were on point and flavors so Exotic! The gelato, the passion fruit assortments.... ugh. The coffee, fresh juice.... I wish I had another stomach.
