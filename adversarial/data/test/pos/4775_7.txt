I give this place 4.5 stars.  This was the first time I've been here for dinner.  The other two times were to have breakfast.  I looked at the menu online before I went, and I was pretty certain what I'd get but I wanted to see any specials they might have.\n\nSoup:  I got the Spinach potage, the name on the specials board.  My waiter described it as a potato leek soup with emulsified with spinach.  It had a goat cheese mousse on top with some Ni√ßoise olive oil.  Very tasty soup.\n\nMain course: Steak frites.  Cooked rare as ordered and tons of french fries.  This is very characteristic of any Bouchon meal with frites.  At some point, you have to decide whether you want to finish all of those tasty critters or save some room for dessert and just let them go.  That's what I opted to do.\n\nDessert:  The desserg special tonight was Neopolitan French macaron ice cream sandwiches one of each of the traditional Neopolitan flavors.  They're the standard macarons you can buy in the Bouchon Bakery downstairs but they were filled with ice cream rather than the cream the macarons normally have.  These were outstanding.\n\nI really like coming to Bouchon.  I like the room, the nice view to the 10th floor courtyard, and the food is quit interesting.  My server was Brandon, and he was excellent!  The bus person was there to refill my iced tea, and when he noticed there wasn't enough ice, he brought me a new glass of ice, filled it with tea, and took the other glass away.  Really outstanding service.  \n\nIt's no wonder that when I have a friend text me that he's going to Bouchon for breakfast and asks, \"Do you want to meet me there?\" that I send a Yes answer back quickly.\n\nHere are the links to the photos of tonights repast.\n\n\nSpinach potage:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=pgpbWHklxCYh2BqhFbzY6Q\n\nButter cup, bread, and dish of pistachios:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=2GpdTnZLS1ERZkIEo8aA8w\n\nSteak frites:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=UPsLa1GuEymVl0bmHu0uSw\n\nNeopoliatan French Macaron ice cream sandwiches \n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=4FQvAgqPM5ArZelwZpSiSg\n\nIced Tea and carafe:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=zpxcTWEoBQuXsoMlsXJq5w\n\nNapkin with menu:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=FN8sFAnuP3Lt2sLxrBu7Vg\n\nSpecials board:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=JrLU1pWJcwv8wnUOupJK-g
