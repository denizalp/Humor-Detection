It was my first time here in a while, let's just say before they renovated. \n\nI like to get to clubs early because I hate waiting in line. And the semi-fullness of a club is the best. It's the calm before the storm where you can actually hear each other talk, and actually dance because there is room on the floor. \n\nThat's exactly the case here. We came in around 10:30pm and there were some people around, but it was nice. \n\nThe decor has become more rustic, and in the light makes it feel like you're in someone's trendy living room. I can see this as a great place to hold a corporate or wedding function.  Booths line the perimeter on a raised surface, which is nice as if you're sitting there you're not staring at people's crotches. \n\nWhat I liked at first was the ample seating in the centre of the dance floor, huge plush loveseats. But then as the night filled up it just got in the way and really should have been moved. There were also some seating around the dance floor but seems like a tripping hazard to me. \n\nFriday night. If you're looking for an Asian Boy, this is the place to be. There were definitely more boys than gals here. I also felt like I was in HK. If you're into that, this is great. The music was supposed to be hiphop and top 40, but it was more hiphop, some dance but very minimal, and the only songs I knew was anything released before 2005. Wasn't really my scene, but in this review I'm trying to be objective. \n\nThe place started filling up around 12pm, and by 1am it was so crowded that you couldn't stand there without being pushed around, let alone dance. Some of these people are extremely pushy and I dislike that. \n\nSeemed like the place to be was the brightly lit bathrooms. High ceilings and individual stalls, it was a nice place to just get away from it all. \n\nI liked the two coat checks, helped with getting things to move around quicker. \n\n$15 cover.\n\nIt so seems that people dress up for clubs again. People will be wearing dresses mostly. If you're anything like me, you might  be wearing too much clothes, so as to not look too hoochie, but then feel old, and hooch it up in the end. Guys are wearing jeans and a blazer mostly. \n\nit seems like from their we website, there is another club open, Cabin Five, which is meant to be less elite, and a different crowd (according to the website) but I don't know.
