The restaurant is trattoria style, meaning an eating establishment concept popular in Italy, less formal than a white linen table cloth dining joint would be, with an open floor plan and family sized portions.\n\nWe started with the ordered the Calamari fritti $13 and Bruschette alla Romana $8 antipasti and the Tilapia Vesuvio for the entree.\n\nThe calamari was very good, lightly fried and peppery. The marinara that accompanied it however was overly salty and overtook the delicate calamari. The bruschette is one of my favorite things to order at a true, Italian restaurant. The toast was lightly brushed with garlic oil, topped with fluffy mozzarella, finished with a ripe tomato slice and garnished with fresh basil.\n\nThe tilapia was of nice thickness, sauteed with herbs and garlic, you could taste a hint of lemon. It was light and didn't have a hint of fish flavor. It was accompanied by roasted tomatoes and artichoke with a balsamic vinaigrette reduction.\n\nThe best part was that after dinner we didn't have to bare the cold because they have validated parking. All you have to do is walk out of the restaurant to the parking ramp and off you go.
