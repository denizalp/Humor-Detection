Atmosphere is not bad like other reviewers described. The place is actually nice when you compare it to other coffee shops in Scarborough. \n\nBut I am never coming back here again. \n\nThe lady at the counter is R-U-D-E and ripped me off. I ordered medium iced coffee and she asked me if I wanted sugar and I said yes. But she gave me small iced coffee and charged me for vanilla syrup... when I corrected her, she made it sound like it was my fault. Anyways, this other girl changed it to the medium sized iced coffee but all she did was add more milk.... really? Seriously disappointed at this place for doing this.\n\nWhen I tasted my \"medium\" iced coffee, I realized that they did not add vanilla syrup.. I drink coffee everyday, sometimes 2-3 times a day and trust me, I KNOW what vanilla syrup tastes like in my coffee. What they added was sugar. The coffee was also not fresh. I saw the girl going into the back to make my drink... I'm going to assume that the they refrigerate their coffee...don't know how long they keep it there.  \n\nI walked out thinking how I would rather go somewhere else and pay more to get a proper coffee.\n\nThanks Coffee Culture on Ellesmere, for wasting my time and money.
