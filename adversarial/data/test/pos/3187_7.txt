If you're a fan of slightly broken furniture that may or may not be missing a critical piece, then this is the place for you. \n\nThe best deals are in holiday decor and pool furniture. There are some hidden gems there in those categories. The rest of the inventory is pretty junky. \n\nWorth poking your head in if your already at the Pavilions, but wouldn't make a special trip for this (which we did, oops).
