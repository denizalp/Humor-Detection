This place smells horrid. Simply horrid. Some days it's better than others, but it never smells neutral or good. It smells like some sort of food has rotted and maybe some small creature died -- years ago -- and then everything fell into the bog of eternal stench.\n\nThe staff does not speak much English. The store is small and cramped. It does, however, feature some items and brands that you would not find elsewhere, and it clearly has found a niche in the marketplace. It's *always* busy.\n\nBut it smells really bad.
