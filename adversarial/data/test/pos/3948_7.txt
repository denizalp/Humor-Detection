I've been to many a Wal-Mart in my day.\nI own an atlas telling me of every location in the US and Mexico\nI've worked at a bunch of locations.\nI've slept in Wal-Mart parking lots across the country.\nI've vaguely showered in a Wal-Mart sink in Illinois and vomited in a Wal-Mart bathroom in East Greenbush, NY.\nMy groceries have come from her, as have many a Christmas present.\n\nAnd throughout my ongoing relationship with Wal-Mart, I have never come across a store like this. Hands down the cleanest, most well organized, aesthetically pleasing Wal-Mart I have ever been to. The store looks brand new, so that might change in a few years...but DAAMN. Buuut just four stars because, well, it's Wal Mart and really doesn't make me go \"WOOHOO! AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!!\"
