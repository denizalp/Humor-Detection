I've gone to these restaurants for years all over town. This is the newest and my favorite location. They serve the best original pancakes in town. Nothing fancy or crazy or over the top. If you're looking for good old fashioned pancakes, this is the spot I'd recommend. The menu is extensive and broad. I've never tried anything but breakfast here, but I've also never tried anything I didn't like here either. I'm very surprised it's received a 3 star average.
