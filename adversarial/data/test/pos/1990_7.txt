The food here is off the hook! Beer bread sandwiches are delicious and the fish and chips are some of the best around! And then there's the beer itself! The only one I personally don't care for is the Peach Ale, but if you like peach I'm sure it'll do it for you! If you're in during the fall give the Pumpkin Porter a try and if you're real lucky they'll have Double Pumpkin on hand. \n\nOn to the service, nine times out of 10 it's on point. And if it isn't, the management cares and wants to know! Today my wife and I went in for lunch, grabbed a table outside. There was still a bill folder on the table from the last customer, combine that with a change of servers and they didn't realize we had just sat down. No big deal, after about five minutes I casually asked the nearest server if we could get some help. The manager quickly came by and let us know he'd make up for it. I reiterated that it wasn't a big deal. Well, the entire bill was comped less the growler of PP we got to go. WTG! You didn't need to, but you ensured already loyal customers left happy. If it happens to you, don't forget to tip your server what they deserve for the amount of work done. Appreciate the service, Jen!
