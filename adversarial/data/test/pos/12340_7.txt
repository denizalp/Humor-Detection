Galloping honeypots, Ocha Thai is a find![1] Their plain Jane interior may not impress, but their Thai and Chinese cooking will.\n\nConsidering Ocha is in the shadow of the Stratosphere, they might seem to be a bit of a dive, especially in comparison to other spots on the Strip. On the contrary, Ocha is clean, and their service wicked fast: we were seated, had our orders taken, and got our food before we could blink. For their speed, we never were rushed.\n\nEverything was expertly prepared, from start to finish. We enjoyed their beef jerky appetizer ($8.95) - chunks of tender spiced beef brisket, sundried then deep-fried - as much as the sweet sauce that came on the side. Their chicken tom yum soup (8.95), flavored with mushrooms, lemongrass, chili and lime juice, helped ward off hunger.\n\nFor entrees, try their pad thai chicken (8.95), stir-fried with bean sprouts, and a lime on the side. It's slightly sweet, with a perfect, light texture. A few plates of combination (pork, chicken, beef) fried rice (9.95\/plate) rounded off our meal nicely. (Somehow we ended up with sticky rice too, but I didn't try any.)\n\nRecommended for a comfortable, affordable lunch.\n\n[1] Thanks Vy for taking me here! Getting here was an adventure, but worth the effort.
