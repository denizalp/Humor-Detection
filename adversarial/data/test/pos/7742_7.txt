Delicious!\n\nFinally had the opportunity to try KoMex. The reviews are correct: the food is awesome. I think this a great lunch place. The location is not in a very good part of town, which probably explains why KoMex is only open until 8pm.\n\nIt really is a hole-in-the-wall spot. Definitely order the FUSION burrito. I personally like the daeji-kogi (daeji= pig) with the kimchi also inside the burrito. Everything is fresh and the free chips\/guac\/sauce they give you are a perfect precursor to the giant burritos.\n\nFor two people to leave completely stuffed our total bill was $10 and change! We ended up leaving them $16 just because we felt guilty that it was so cheap.\n\nDefinitely try KoMex! :)
