Ok, with all the advertisement and commercials on tv, I've wanted to try Applebees for awhile. \n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, it wasn't crowded at all. The bar had. a couple of people and only a couple of tables were filled. \n\nFirst of all, service was very slow. It wasn't busy so I couldn't figure that one out. Secondly, I thought it was a little odd that our waitress kept sitting down at a table diagonal to our where a baby and man were eating periodically. Later, I realized that must have been her baby and significant other. Even if the restaurant was slow, I thought that was unprofessional. \n\nWe got the meal deal for $20 that came with an appetizer and two meals. \nThe mozzarella sticks appetizer was pretty good but just like any other place. I got steak which I asked for medium rare and it was cooked well the steak was pretty chewy. My companion had some pasta dish that wasn't so good. \n\nSo overall, price was about the only thing that was good. It kind of reminded me of chili's but I thought Chili's back home in Hawaii was better. it seems like it would be a good family place. But I definitely was disappointed.  ^_^*~
