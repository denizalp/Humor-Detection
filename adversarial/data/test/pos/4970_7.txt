~ A solid 3.5 stars ~\n\nThis here is authentic taste of Damascus in the heart of Mississauga. My partner in crime and I wanted to go some place different and this place was it. The vibe and atmosphere was amazing and that is the reason for some hefty prices compared to others restaurants plus the service was a bit slow. Hence, that is the reason they gave me mixed emotions and received a solid slightly above A-OK rating. \n\nThe experience as soon as you enter was amazing with right furniture in place and halal certification right at the entrance, slightly turned down by no one coming to seat us even though there were servers right there who weren't acknowledging us. Along came the manager or may be the owner, friendly person; had us seated and gave us a high chair as well. We started to look into the menu and the choices were plenty...Hence, we ordered a few items, so put their food to taste and tried their:\n\n- FALAFEL- Chickpeas mixed with parsley, onions, garlic, mint, chili powder, cinnamon, cumin and golden fried. \nThis here was in the appetiser section but was like a meal. The felafels were big and tasted great, due to the fact they were made fresh.\n\n-ROMAN ZAMAN KIBBEH (MIX) - 2 Fried beef kibbeh, 2 fried potato kibbeh, 2 Fried Helah kibbeh and 2 Grilled Beef Kibbeh. \nNow Kibbeh was something new and it was like a Jamaican patty. Some of the types were amazing and some not so much.\n\n- ROMAN ZAMAN SHAWARMA PLATTER - Beef and chicken Shawarma, pomegranate molasses, garlic sauce. \nThis here was not bad and the meat was cooked well.\n\nPresentation of the food was very well. The portion size were ok but as mentioned above the price was on the high-end and could get very expensive with a bigger family.\n\nI also got their Watermelon juices which was more like slushy but was amazing.\n\nThey also have tall hats at the entrance to wear and a picture can be taken at their funky entrance seat.\n\nOverall, A decent place to try but can't be done on a regular basis.\n\nFor my Muslim folks - The food here is halal, I confirmed with the server and their certifications are on the wall at the entrance.
