I had been really looking forward to eating at Pizzeria Bianco as my last restaurant in Phoenix.  In my 8 years here as a Phoenician, I had never set aside an evening to devote to getting a pizza here.  So for my last evening here, I made a point of going.\n\nIt was okay.\n\nI don't think it's the best pizza in Arizona, let alone America.  It definitely wasn't worth the 2 1\/2 hour wait. And it absolutely was not worth the attitude from the bitchy hostess.\n\nI didn't like the charred bread that covered my hands and face with soot and gave the pizza a bitter and burnt flavor. And the pizza with salami we ordered was limp and soggy.  Ignoring those things, the pizza was pretty good.  And I did ignore those things because I was starving.  Maybe that's why so many people love this place - being taunted with the idea of good pizza for hours kind of skews ones perception.
