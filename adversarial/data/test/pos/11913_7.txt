Halloween VEGAS REVIEW - part 4\nHey, where do you feel like eating?\n\nThat's right! We ate here right before heading out for a night of clubbin and debauchery. I left the ordering in the more than capable hands of my friend. He had ordered a lot of things but most importantly he got me my uni and a bottle of sake. I, of course followed up with a big bottle of Asahi. You can never go wrong with Asahi. Especially a big bottle of Asahi. It helps set the tone of the night, if you get my meaning. \n\nThough coupled with lack of sleep and many, many, many liquid stay awake aids I have barely have any idea what I ate. And it was great... great this, great that but it was nothing too crazy. Just a lot of simple fare done really well. Though the staff was a little off, though it may have been our overpowering conversation about casual sex. I do remember all of the food being fresh without a hint of ocean staleness. And if you know uni as well as I do, you know you can't fake freshness. I love uni! Hell, one dish they even made the sauce with UNI! \nZOMG!\n*drool\n;D
