I need to update my review, My single mom friends used to make this one of our regular hang outs, but it seems like the new owners Hate parents and discourage having kids in their establishment. I say this because they do Not honor happy hour specials for people sitting on the (non)bar side.. So what your telling \"us\" is~ Don't come here for dinner and a happy hour drink after the kids game! So different from the days when kids jerseys hung in the rafters, watching the kids laugh while we took a short break and caught up with other parents. The food is still good and the staff tries, but I feel punished for being a mom at the tavern!
