Hesitated to write this because I don't want it to be so crowded we can't get in!!! LOL! Finally a GREAT Thai place close to home. Been in the area for 15 yrs and so happy we don't have to drive to Chinatown for our Thai craving. Food is very tasty and service has been great. We've been here at least 10 times since we found it this summer.
