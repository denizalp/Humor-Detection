I've certainly been satisfied with the service I received so far, and this is all despite of the construction efforts inside the building.\n\nMy BMW has had a suspension problem as well as a flat tire. I simply wanted to compare costs of repairing the car here and at the auto shop I normally go to (which I will not mention here), and they took my car to the repair shop, showed me every single problem there is with the car, what the priorities are, and exactly what parts they would need and how much it would cost; all this for free! I made sure to tell them I'm exploring cost differentials with my regular body shop, and the mechanics were fine with that.\n\nTo add to what was supposed to be a simple visit, the mechanics noticed my car was quite dirty. They decided to give me a free car wash! I definitely said yes, as with the cold spell we're currently in there was no way I would take my car to a car wash and dry it without it getting icy. One small problem at the end though was that my wipers had to be readjusted as it stopped cleaning the windshield for some reason...\n\nI won't mention the cost differentials in my review, just that the staff here are very honest, will go through every single detail, and I can assure you will get the best bang for your buck.\n\nFree wifi!
