This place is overrated at it's current 4.5 star average as of this writing.  Let me explain...\n\n1). When I walked in & up to the counter, we were not acknowledged or greeting.  When the man in charge, possibly he was an owner, finally went to take our order I let him know in a positive and friendly manner that this was our first time here & that we heard great things on Yelp so we decided to drive over and check it out.  His response was emotionless and you could tell he simply wanted us to place our order instead of engage in a friendly exchange.  He wasn't rude, just not really friendly.\n\n2). I ordered a spicy chicken panini that had prosciutto because he said it was one of his top three sandwiches.  The prosciutto ended up being fatty, chewy and difficult to bite through without risking pulling all of it out of the sandwich in a single bite.\n\n3). I don't like their way overpriced drink coolers with no other options like fountain drinks or refillable ice teas.  It's price gauging.\n\nI can think of a dozen different places in town with superior sandwiches that would be a better use of one's time & money.\n\nI think this 3-star review is the best I can give at this time.
