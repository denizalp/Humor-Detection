I'm going middle of the road on this one because I think it has potential, but there are a lot of little annoyances that really pile up. \n\nThe good...\n- The food was very flavorful overall and the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork.    We sampled the brisket, the dirty fries, and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was a little bland, but the meal showed a lot of promise.  There isn't a really good barbeque place in town, so this fills a void.  \n- The portions are pretty large overall.  The place seems geared toward a family style type of ordering process, which is what I would recommend.   We paid $34 for the food part of our meal, which was more than enough for two people.  You could very easily spend 2-3 times as much depending on what you order, but there is a range of options.  \n- The service.  For a new restaurant, the service was decent.  It took a long time to get the check; but other than that, he was friendly and was around when needed.  I also like that they pack the leftovers for you when it's time to go.   \n\nThe annoyances...\n- The plates are way too small.  We got a lunch tray with our food and then two tiny side plates.  No room to arrange a meal on the plate or sample the sauces.  At best, you can get a few bites of one or two things at a time on that plate.      \n- The seating arrangement is not awesome.  \"Our\" table, when it was ready, turned out to be a communal table up front.  I had a humongous table leg directly in front of me, so I had to sit awkwardly and was super close to the strangers on either side of me.  There was no place for my purse or jacket at all.  When our server came to fill our waters, he could barely squeeze in to reach them.  From my seat, I couldn't reach any of the sauces, silverware, paper towels, etc. without asking a stranger to pass them over.  As a result, I only tried one sauce.  \n- Our food was cold.  Both the brisket and mac and cheese were served lukewarm at best.  I chalk that up to the newness of the place, but it did affect my overall meal.  \n- So noisy.  We had to shout across the table to hear each other.   That combined with being so close to other patrons made conversation sort of awkward.  I couldn't hear the server and he couldn't hear me.  The d√©cor is not in any way designed to knock down the noise level, so be prepared.   \n- Canned wine.  Now, I am a cheap wine connoisseur and can absolutely appreciate a can of wine; however, I cannot appreciate a $24 can of wine.  It was pretty decent tasting and I did appreciate that it was two glasses at once (so I didn't have to make that poor server squish in to serve me another), but I feel like you've got to have a lot of nerve to charge $24 for a can of wine.  \n\nAll in all, it's another DeShantz restaurant.  Overdone and a little pretentious.  Prices on the highest end of reasonable, but with food that stands up.
