Went straight from work to check out Mekong Plaza last night after chatting with coworker \"JJ\" about the good deals she found there.  She was able to find her fave brand of rice, grapes, garlic, and other items.  She was lamenting that she only had twenty minutes to look around; she therefore allowed herself to buy those items she knew cost less here than at Lee Lee.  After she'd listed off what she had paid $53 for, I told her she should count her blessings that she only had those few minutes to shop!  I asked her if she preferred it over Lee Lee, and while she liked the newness of the place and the lower costs of some items, she didn't like how items in the produce section were plastic-wrapped; she liked being able to hand-pick her veggies and fruits.  Another coworker had mentioned the plaza's opening to me days prior and had piqued my interest the moment she uttered the words, \"there are five restaurants...\"  I was getting hungry while JJ and I chatted, so there was no question where I was heading to after clocking out.\n\nAs I pulled into the almost empty parking lot at around 8:20p, I noticed that the entrance doors were flagged by two restaurants- one called MyLynn Cafe that was still open for business, and the other looked like a coffee shop that was already closed for the day.  I grabbed a menu from MyLynn (beverages that included fountain, coffee, and smoothies, $5 or less, and a page of chef's specials of about 8 or so items, soups mostly, $5-10) intending to stop here after my pit stop at the grocery.\n\nThis building is HUGE!  I saw white everywhere I looked- floors, statues, and walls.  Most lots (indoor shops) were still unoccupied, and I was beginning to think I may never find the grocery store as all I could see where closed shops (dentistry, jewelry store, a movie rental shop, etc) and more restaurants.  When coworkers mentioned there were a few eateries in place, I expected to encounter a layout similar to that of Whole Food's (Ray\/101), so this building really threw me for a loop- walking around MP actually felt like I was perusing through one of the mini-malls back home (Philippines).  Thinking it over just now, I also remember malls in NJ that had similar layouts.  But I digress... I spotted two \"opening soon\" food-court type sections for Korean and Japanese food before turning the corner and finding two more Vietnamese restaurants (Vietnamese Restaurant and Un-pho-gettable).  These venues stood right across from the grocery store.  Finally, I reached my destination!  Before investigating the grocery, I entered Un-pho-gettable and skimmed through their extensive menu and saw the entree prices ranged from around $8 to $20 or more.  I asked a person who seemed like the manager what time they closed.  He replied usually 8p, but if it's busy then they would close at 8:30p.  I told him that if they were still open, I would return shortly.\n\nA quick glance around MP revealed large seafood, meats, and refrigerated sections (not counting those refrigerated aisles that wrapped around the back of the store).  Indeed, these three departments occupied a third of the grocery.  Don't quote me on this, but I think that the produce department was also a part of that section, but I wasn't looking for fruits or veggies that night.  I was on the hunt for the Filipino aisle, specifically for brands of peanut butter other than Lily's, which is the only brand to be found at Lee Lee.  Unfortunately, I only found the one brand, which is $0.20 less here.  I did, however, find PRESERVATIVE-FREE jackfruit and macapuno (\"coconut sport\") strings (two delicious components of a nectarous icy snack\/beverage called halo-halo).  \n\nTo keep this review from tiring the both of us, I will wrap it up by saying that I will definitely be back to have another longer look around the aisles, which did not seem as country-specific as Lee Lee's.  It does reverberate highly with me already bec. I found those last two items.  What else would I find??  I'm brimming with anticipation!  \n\nBTW, since the pho place was already closed by 8:40p,  I decided to try the one next door, which had a Vietnamese title and ended with \"Vietnamese Restaurant.  Review will be posted shortly.
