The WORST school in Vegas. They put a lot of effort in the website, but the they don't teach you anything. Teachers are all former dealers that were fired and banned from casinos. Plus previous comment was right, nobody teaches you anything, you have to teach yourself. \nThe BIGGEST LIE is job placement assistance!!! They tell you that when you sign up, but after you graduate, they say if some casino will call asking for a dealer, I'll let you know??? I was there for 4 months and NOT ONE graduate was sent to an audition. \nMost students stay there for months without learning anything and go to another school or give up completely.\nIt's a cheap school, but you get what you pay for. Don't waste your time and money. It's a complete SCAM!!!
