It's all about the Kahlua Kicker. \nUnfortunately there's no booze in it but it's just as good without (almost). \nFrighteningly perky staff. Either it's the caffeine or they're suckin' on the whip cream, but they are way to happy for college students working at a coffee shop. \nI was very sad when I moved away from Tempe only to have discovered Dutch...but fear not! That building that's being constructed on Central and Camelback, it's gonna be a Dutch! Now I can shop at Francis and enjoy my Kahlua Kicker whenever I want. Elation!
