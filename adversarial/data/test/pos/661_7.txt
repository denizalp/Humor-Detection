Settebello has arrived on my side of town and I couldn't be happier.  Joining Bachi Burger, 808 Tapas, Firefly, and yes, Jollibee (halo-halo, y'all) in Village Square just means that there are even more options for some great food in one spot.  You can plan a date night with dinner, movie, and dessert in one spot (ColdStone Creamery is here, too).  \nMy friends and I arrived on Friday night at 5:30pm because I was hoping to catch Happy Hour, but alas, Happy Hour at this location is Sunday-Thursday only.  Nonetheless, we still had a fabulous meal with great service.  The place only had two other parties seated at that time, but then it filled up by the time we left.  I had the arancini to start and the Margherita with mushrooms--carb city!  I only had room for two slices of the pizza, but I'm enjoying the leftovers.  The new location is sleek and modern inside with a view of the wood-burning stove from most of the dining room.  Their pizza is not for everyone, especially if you like Americanized pies from Pizza Hut or Dominoes.  This pizza is authentic Napoli-style with most ingredients imported from Italy.  If you've never had Settebello's pizza, now's the time to give it a try, especially if you live in the 'hood, too.  Mangia!
