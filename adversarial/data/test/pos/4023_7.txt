Actually really good. Came here for the cheap breakfast burrito not expecting much...Well, I was a little worried. I think its $3.99 and I went thorugh the drivce through. I am always nervous of the drive through at any \"'ertos\" location due to time sat waiting...and waiting. Well, not so much the case here at all. I ordered two one for me, one for my boyfriends sister. It was about eight bucks. The friendly younger girl was polite at the window, the order came out quick and the green salsa was really good. The burrito consisted of egg, ham and cheese. I was actually happy there was no poatoes because I consider them a boring \"filler\". They were HUGE, cheap and tatsed fresh and great. I will get them again for sure :)
