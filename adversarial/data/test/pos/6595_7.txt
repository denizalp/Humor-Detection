My used rv trailer purchase was a great experience , My salesman Jay L. made me feel at home and is a hell of a guy. I would send anyone I knew who was in the market for an rv to see Jay.  I bought an expandable trailer as is, it does need some work in the plumbing area of the trailer, but I feel I got it at a price that is fair. They even replaced a couple of tires due to the safety inspection.   So again I think they were very fair  I am happy and the wife is getting happy.  Lol.
