Every time I visit this place I'm blown away by the quality of their food and service. Having never been a fan of fried-chicken *gasp* outside of a chicken finger basket Blue Ribbon won me over with their crispy skin and juicy interior. \n\nThe Firebird is one of my favorite sandwiches. You can win me over with any variation on a chipotle sauce. I am also a big fan of their Kale Salad. I was a bit wary of it because just about everyone is doing a kale something or other on their menu. The salad was a nice mix of healthy crunch with the fried chicken I was enjoying.\n\nThe food comes out fast, they serve Boylan natural sodas, and cocktails on draft. Their draft beer selection is a nice mix of national and local and might I recommend the Hazelberry boozy milkshake. It's a blend of Nutella and Chambord. \n\nI have yet to visit this location into the wee hours, but they are open until 2am. As if that's not reason enough to give this place five stars!
