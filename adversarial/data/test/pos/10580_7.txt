If I could give them a negative five, I would! I'm going to leave two negative reviews indicative of my two horrible experiences. I'll start with what happened yesterday. I ordered my food at 12:55. I ONLY ORDERED ONE ORDER OF PAD THAI! I told the boy on the phone that I would bet there in thirty minutes, so let's just say 1:30. I ended up stopping at the grocery store, so I wasn't able to get there for another twenty minutes. That means they had nearly an hour to make ONE ORDER OF CHICKEN PAD THAI! That's it. It wasn't ready. On too of that, they said it's be another twenty minutes!!! Are you kidding me!?! I'll NEVER EVER GO BACK!
