It was inevitable. There I was, adorned in showy bachelorette paraphernalia, complete with a phallic-shaped blow up doll, of which I was forced to carry around everywhere we went (even during the day when families with little children were around). So of course I was pulled on stage for one of the Chippendale acts since, as much as I tried to duck and hide, I was very hard to miss. My friends were also so kind as to get the VIP seats so we were seated in the first few rows, thus increasing the chances of me becoming one of the participants. So thoughtful! They think of everything!\n\nSo I got to be the girl who got \"bitten\" during the vampire act. As I was being escorted backstage I kept thinking to myself, \"Wow these guys are so polite!\" I've been to a few of these kind of shows, for either bachelorette parties or girl's night out, and at every other show (Thunder from Down Under, Hollywood Men in LA) the guys try to molest you, which goes without saying that that is the worst part of coming to one of these things. It's like, I just paid YOU for you to be able to cop a feel and grab my ass? Yay! Well that is not the case with Chippendales; they are totally hands off. Then I come to find out that the guy who does the vampire act is THE gay Chippendale that came out to the public. Well then it all makes sense and I sure lucked out (not being sarcastic in any way). Hey, a hot guy is a hot guy and it's all in fun anyway!\n\nOverall, it was a good time. Also, don't expect any Channing Tatum level of dancing but if you come with an open mind and a good attitude you can still enjoy the show!\n\np.s. There were a few elderly women sitting next to us in the \"VIP\" section having a great time. So it's fun for all ages!!
