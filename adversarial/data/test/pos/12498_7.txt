Pretty disappointed by our experience.  Got here last night around 9pm for Calvin Harris.  Omnia doesn't open until 10pm.\n\nGUEST LIST LINE:\nNo one monitors the line and it's disconnected (broken into sections) the whole way down which creates a lot of people cutting into the line.\n\nSTAFF:\nSo after waiting 45 minutes staff came by to check ID and stamp us.  Then the guest list girls check ID for the name listed on the guest list.  They literally hate their jobs because none of them smiled and they had an \"I'm better than all of you attitude.\"  But I'm confused...u don't run shit ur the guest list checkers lol.  Know your role.\n\nADMISSION:\nSo this is where things were confusing.  Free for women and $75 entry for men up to 12am.  Did not know it was $75.  The guest list girls said the price is just going to go up as the night goes on.  We ended up leaving.
