This is a college bar that is open to the public. Keep that in mind when you walk in on a Saturday and are ignored for 15 minutes straight by three different bartenders. \n\nThings apparently more important than serving you drinks (especially if you appear over the age of 21): \n- putting glassware away\n- cutting lemons and limes\n- chatting with friends\n- entering tips and tabs into the computer like it's closing time\n\nAs a bartender of over 10 years in my past life (yes, even while I was in college) none of the things mentioned above are more important than making money for the bar: AKA SERVING DRINKS TO PATRONS. I would have been fired. Period. Fruit is to be cut before opening. Glassware can be cleaned and restocked by a bar back or just ONE of the three bartenders, but not during a rush. And tips\/tabs are entered at the end of the night. \n\nI did not try the food, but the lack of service left a bad taste in my mouth. Talk about amateur hour. And being a college bar isn't an excuse. I expected way more based on the positive reviews and was beyond disappointed. \n\nTwo stars because my tequila wasn't over-priced and was free-hand poured.
