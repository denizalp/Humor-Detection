Another coffee shop in the neighborhood, YAYYYYY! \n\nI really wanted to like this place because who doesn't like the whole mystery of Free Masons and The Ilumminate --- and in coffee form??!!!\nYet, I found their drinks to be \"for people who don't like real coffee\" as my boyfriend would say it. \n\nThen again, maybe we just ordered the wrong things. \n\nService was great as (I believe) the owner rang us up. She was very helpful and courteous. \n\nAmbiance is stellar. Super hipster. GREAT black and white art on the wall -- although the idk how this place got labelled as an art gallery. Lighting in the back changed from orange to red to yellow, which kept our area lit well. Great soft sofas; our area had vintage a Ms. Pacman arcade as our table. \nThis place would be ideal if I was in college and in study groups! \n\nAs soon as I saw Andes candies as an ingredient in a drink -- I knew that was the one for me. I added an extra shot of espresso to that, which cost $2.50. \nBoyfriend got the Nutella and butterfinger macaron. \nOverall we paid $22 on 2 coffees and a macaron. \n\nThe macaron was gigantic. And they had a large array of flavors! Crunchy and soft. I liked it a lot. But, quite LARGE for me or him alone. \n\nMy 16oz was bigger than expected, which was good. But so sweet that I didn't really taste the espresso. It basically didn't taste strong enough for me. I did like the side of Andes candies. \n\nAs soon as my BF got his drink, he knew he ordered the wrong thing. For his part, he normally likes unsweetened coffee so he (nor I) doesn't know why he ordered the Nutella. He was hesitant in returning the drink but, I told him to just exchange it for his regular (his drink of choice is ice coffee black with a shot of espresso, no sweetener of any kind). \n\nHe got his \"regular\" and the girl said \"if you need more sweetener, there's some on the side.\" \nTo which I said, \"more???\" He didn't want any sweetener or creme but, they had put creme in there. \n\nAfter that he just had a bad taste in his mouth and was just upset that he paid $12 (for his part) on something that he didn't like. \n\nLike I said this is not the place for people who like coffee. This is a specialty sweet coffee kinda place. Not to say that I won't be back with other friends but, this first impression wasn't a great one =(
