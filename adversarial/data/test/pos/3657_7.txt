Oh Bottega, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways!  I have been coming to Bottega for a long time because they make the best pizza in the city, no questions asked.  Pre-Bottega Montreal and its surrounding areas had been lacking a proper Neapolitan pizza but they changed that when they opened their first location in Little Italy a few years ago.  Of course it became so popular that the second one in Laval would soon follow.\n\nHaving experienced both Bottega locations, the Laval one is definitely my favourite.  The menu and quality of the food is the same at both.  The Laval location is bigger so it feels more spacious and I find it easy to get a reservation here even at the last minute.  Also in this location there is always plenty of parking available.\n\nThe menu is small and focused.  Pizza is the star here so while they have appetizers, or sfizi as they call them you should come here expecting to eat pizza as your main dish.  As far as the sfizi goes my personal favourites are the meatballs and the insalata caprese, which contains real mozzarella di bufala.\n\nNow let's be clear on something.  They do Naples-style pizzas which means that they are simple and have only a handful of ingredients.  Don't worry though because while they may seem simple they are bursting with flavour.  They use a wood-burning oven which always gives the crust a nice, smoky taste that can't be reproduced in an electric oven.  They also use higher quality ingredients which of course makes for a tastier pizza.\n\nThe dessert menu is small but they do a good job with everything on it.  I'm a fan of their cannoli which always have a crunchy exterior while still being loaded with decadent ricotta filling.  Good cannoli are hard to find but Bottega gets it right.\n\nThe service here is generally pretty good with the occasional off night.  For the most part the food comes quickly.  The wait staff also knows the menu very well and can be counted on to make recommendations if you are unsure of what to order.\n\nIf you are looking for an amazing pizza that will remind you of what you get in Italy then this is the place.  I don't come to Bottega too often but I always enjoy myself when I do.  The restaurant is in a class of its own.
