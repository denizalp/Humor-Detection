Not too bad as far as buffets go, but a little pricey to go on a weekend if you're a vegetarian (not sure it's quite worth the money for the limited variety of vegetarian options available) and buffets like the Wynn have a little better ambiance and are more impressive if you have out of town guests visiting. No major complaints, but also nothing to write home about.
