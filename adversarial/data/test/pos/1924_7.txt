I can't believe I EVER stepped foot in Vegas without contacting Stacia!!\n\nSpent the weekend in Vegas and things were pretty slow, even slower, given we were staying off the Strip. All we wanted to do was party and we didn't really have any hooks to the right clubs... until I remembered stopping by this Yelp page while preparing for our Vegas trip. BEST EPIPHANY EVERRRRRRRRRR!\n\nStacia is absolutely the best. She was on top of everything and always got back to us. She even offered to have us join her at her own table at another club when we almost didn't get into the club of our choice. She really knows how to pull some strings. She did it and we seriously owe it all to her. Although we would probably have had a BLAST partying it up with her, we had our hearts set on the club of our 1st choice. She even followed up with the day after to see how everything went. \n\nWe skipped the damn line and walked past the velvet ropes. No cover charge, either. Hell yeah, hell yeah.\n\nTHANK YOU, STACIA. YOU ARE THE BEST!!!\nHad the best weekend because of you. Going back home sucked! Teheheh. We're going back and definitely hitting you up first thing. Thanks again!
