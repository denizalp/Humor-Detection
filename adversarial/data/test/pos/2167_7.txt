Came here on a Tuesday evening during prime dinner hours don't even know how this is acceptable the pictures write the review for me. Does JIP even have standards? I asked a kitchen employee where is everything she said what would you like I'm like everything ! There isn't anything out and what's left of what is out doesn't look appetizing to grab. So disgusting will never come to this location again!!!
