Ox Noodle is a small Vietnamese restaurant in the outdoor mall areas right outside of Vaughan Mills Mall, where Levant Restaurant used to be. I've been here twice now and really like their noodle soups. The ordering system is super convenient. They provide you with a pen and paper with checkboxes and prices. Once you order, they come by and highlight everything you ordered, which seems like a bit unnecessary but whatever works!\n\nWe usually order dumplings as appetizers. I usually order a noodle soup (comes with 2 toppings) and smoothie. What I like about the paper ordering system is that it gives you the option to exclude ingredients, for example you can ask not to include cilantro if you don't like cilantro. I usually order a mango smoothie, which is super tasty. The noodle soup is really good as well, and is one of the better ones in the area.
