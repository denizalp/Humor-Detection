2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     36\/100\n\nA great spot in Downtown Las Vegas to bring the little kids and big kids (adults)! It's a one stop eat with a variety of foodie spots, boutiques & shops to choose from. \n\nWe always hit up Pinches Tacos, Chillspot by SasaSweets - for the shave ice and pops, & the Kettlecorn shop for that fresh made lemonade. There are a lot of tables and chairs to eat & lounge outside. \n\nThere's a playground with a bad ass slide and a fake grass play area for kids with a stage for live music, a few couches, benches and blocks for the kids to build their own creations. \n\nWhen you're inside the shops (some are very tiny -- fits 5 customers at most) you can't tell that it's built from shipping containers. Very creative and innovative. \n\nThere's still a lot of restaurants here we have yet to try and look forward to enjoying. \n\n** Note: I hope they add a misting system throughout the park for the hot summer months. There's a few near the stage, but nothing around the tables outside of restaurants. \n\nTIP: At 9pm, they kick out the under 21 crowd (even if they're with their parents) and card everyone who wants to stay.
