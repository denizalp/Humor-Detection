I will never deal with these people again. In a town like Madison, where are so many decent bike shops, why would I?\n\nI went because I got a flat.\n\nTrip #1. My boyfriend drops off my bike on a Monday. They say they can't have it ready until the NEXT Thursday (11 days). The also say they're going to lube the brake lines. \n\nTrip #2. My boyfriend comes by to pick up the bike, as stated, a week and a half later. They haven't even touched it yet. They say, \"Did we call you? We'll call you.\" They had never told him to wait until they called. He says that they seem to have totally forgotten about the bike. \n\nA few hours later, they call.\n\nTrip #3. He gets the bike. My flat is fixed. $43 dollars.\n\nI get on the bike to ride it to work. The front brake is rubbing. There were no problems with the brakes when we gave the bike to them.\n\nTrip #4. I have to go back to have them adjust the brakes. The guy running the show takes about 20 seconds. Hands it back to me. \"There you go.\" He says. By the time I get home, the brake is rubbing again, now worse than before. \n\nI call and say, \"Can you tell me how to adjust this? I cannot come to the bike store for a 5th time.\" He says, \"Well, there must be something seriously wrong with your brakes if we adjusted them and they're still rubbing.\" There was nothing wrong with my brakes before I handed the bike over to them. At this point, I am so angry I can barely see straight. \n\nTrip #5. I take the bike in. They take it aside, work on it for 2 minutes, and viola! the brakes work. There's nothing wrong with them. They were just incorrectly adjusted twice. \n\nI'm sorry to have to give a bad review to my local bike shop, but our experience was that they were disorganized and took three times to get something right.
