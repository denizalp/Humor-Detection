Just took my wife here to see raymond Zhang for his balayage treatment. Man this guy his amazing. We've seen other people before for this treatment but never with great results. But this time we finally found someone who can actually do this treatment. His work was quite impressive and well worth the high prices. Treatment also takes a long time but my wife couldn't be happier. I also got my hair cut done there and it was quite good as well. Staff are really nice and salon is really clean and modern. Nice touches like tea when you arrive are also cool. I would really recommend this place and especially to see raymond for his amazing work. You girls won't be disappointed. I have a very happy wife tonight !
