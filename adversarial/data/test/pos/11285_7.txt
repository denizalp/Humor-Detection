We came here on a Friday night and ordered \n1. Fries and fried chicken wings, 8\n2. Chimichunga meal - shredded beef, 11\n3. Enchilada meal - carnitas and cheese, 12.25\nfor $8 (used the $15 Groupon valued at $30) \n\n- Sort of next to WildFire Casino. In a desolate area by itself. Authentic feel. haha. \n- Free chips and salsa. warm, fresh and crispy chips. Generous servings.\n- All food served blazing hot. Seriously, be careful not to touch the plate. \n- Fries and fried chicken were nothing special, taste like any other cheap HH restuarant. Ask for the sauce on the side rather than on the fried chicken. Just had a craving for Fried chicken wings. \n- Chimi was delicious! Deep fried, very crispy! Best tasting chimi I've had thus far. It came with guacamole and sour creme that made it extra flavorful. High recommendation. \n- Enchilada was amazing. The presentation was something I haven't seen before. It had a Fried egg on top. They made it over-medium, which is good, bc even at breakfast restaurants, they have difficulty or just lazy to make an over-medium. \n- Generous servings of meat! \n- Carnitas seemed juicier than the shredded beef\n- I always go to a mexican restaurant and ask for all rice, no bean. Maybe it's the Asian in me. haha. Great tasting rice though. \n- Friendly service. \n\nTues\/Thurs they have AYCE Tacos for 9.99 1-4pm, soft or hard taco, any meat except fish. Sounds like a deal to me :)
