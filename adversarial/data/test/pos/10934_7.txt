This was my first time at an Escape Room and I wouldn't want to go to any other.\nWe did Framed and got out with just a couple minutes left to spare and it was just the right level in terms of difficulty.\nI love that it's a board game cafe and an escape room - it provides such a fun atmosphere with flexibility. Plus they have console games too! And awesome Tetris lamps. I need to find out where to get me some of those.\nI really enjoyed the popcorn and the beautiful latte. Definitely need to try some of their other menu items.\nThe staff here are unbelievably amazing, literally the best service I've had, EVER. I love that they're super friendly and approachable. A huge shout out to Dennis!\n\nCan't wait to come back!
