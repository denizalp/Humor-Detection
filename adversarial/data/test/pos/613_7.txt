Camelback Ford wouldn't replace this light even when I complained about it  numerous times prior to my 36,000 warranty end. Now that I'm in the 50s and get to look at my taillight like this for weeks after it rains.. It's pretty aggravating. This place is worthless. You'd think that by buying a new car you would be covered for weird instances like this especially when you're under a factory warranty. They are an absolute joke don't buy a car here don't get your car serviced here.
