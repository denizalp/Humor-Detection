Good tasting, cheap wings ($.25 on Tues, Thurs,  and Sat), but keeps an awful patronage,  atmosphere,  and absurdly slow service. The beer selection available on draught is mediocre at best (uniformly cheapo pilsners like coors and bud; It's a sports bar, so I honestly can't expect seeing a bunch of delicious craft beers, but these guys can't even pull off a Heineken or Stella.) . Have been there several times now on a variety of days and times.\n\nAt times, the music is kept at a good level for conversation,  but a DJ tends to pop out of nowhere, and he cranks up the volume to an ungodly level. At times such as these,  it's impossible to talk to the people you came with, and you must either meekly stare at the TV and ignore the friends you came with, or yell yourself hoarse in a vain attempt to talk to your party.\n\nService is ridiculously slow; in general, it takes 20 minutes from seating to get your menu, a half hour to 40 minutes for your food, and a further 40 minutes for your server to check up on you; if you get fed up ane ask for your bill, be prepared to wait a looooong time. They only seem to have one or two servers on at a time,  and it's clearly not enough.\n\nThe patronage kept by the bar isn't entirely salubrious either; blatantly blue collar types who are loud, and not entirely respectful of other groups' space. There's usually a few other respectful parties in there-probably just there for the wings-but it's probably not a great idea to come here if you want a relaxed night.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is the wings, which are sufficiently tastey and cheap.
