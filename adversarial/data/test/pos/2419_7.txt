Worst possible place you can eat at. The girl working the counter was rude. I went to get ketchup for my meal and their machine squirted it all over me and my light clothes. I told the girl and she laughed and said okay? There was no sympathy, no free meal which I expected considering my 70 dollar plus outfit was ruined. Never eating here again.
