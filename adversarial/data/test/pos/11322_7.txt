What an awful experience I had last night at this place! Let's just say that it wasn't my idea to come here in the first place but a friend of mine suggested it after we left a concert. I am all for giving places the benefit of doubt so with that being said I agreed! Let's talk about service and how it's completely non existent in this place. I believed we arrived maybe around 2:00 AM seated quickly but that's when the problems started. Our server this morning was JOEY and wow what a smart ass he was. I didn't appreciate his service at ALL. Our table had questions on the menu and he just had this nonchalant ass attitude with us and thought that it was funny. I specifically had my issue with him because I decided on the Italian style omelet and inquired about having it made with egg whites. I asked him if it was possible and he says of course but it will be a charge ranging from maybe $2-4? I'm thinking to myself how don't you know the FIRM ACTUAL up charge on this but whatever he checked with the source whomever that was and confirmed it was $2. You are the server so know your menu! I said that's no problem at all go ahead and order it! When our food came everybody's plate came correct but mine. Want to guess what didn't get done? Yep! My omelet came full of cholesterol and yellow as ever! It was clear that my simple request didn't get put in because he was to busy being so damn condescending. We brought this to his attention right away and he brought me a small plate to scoop my plate of potatoes on and the says \"well do you want me to have them make it over\" DUH wtf? After about 20 minutes I had finished my side order of pancakes and some of my friends plate because she felt bad that I still hadn't received my order. Another person in our party didn't et her wheat toast that came with her meal and had asked 3 times for it! Just a complete train wreck he was unapologetic for all this and then when our bill came we had a random 6oz New York steak and eggs added to our bill and I was double charged for my omelette. When again we brought this to his attention he says oh only the manager can fix this hold on, took the bill and went missing! After waiting about 10-15 minutes we still haven't got our correct bill so we spotted the manager TRICIA who was behind the scenes flagged her down and said can we get this done asap?! Her response was somewhat like she cared and when I pulled her to the side to let her know the unacceptable behavior from her serve JOEY and the lack of hospitality she apologized. Did nothing about the bill though they made sure they still collected them coins! Won't be back that's for sure!
