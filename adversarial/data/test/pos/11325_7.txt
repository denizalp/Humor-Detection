This is one grimy hotel and casino. Of course I didn't expect much of the IP to begin with, but I was pretty disappointing. I was actually surprised that they had keycards instead of keys. \n\nPros:\n1) Great location. Centrally located and is on the center strip.\n2) Prices are relatively reasonable.\n3) You could actually walk onto the patio and have a view of the strip in the penthouse floor.\n\nCons:\n1) Check-in lines at the front desk take forever because they only have a few staff working.\n2) Every time I step into the elevator there are more beer bottles and cups lying all over the floor. Feels like the aftermath of a college party.\n3) Restaurants aren't the greatest of quality. Only ate here because it was convenient.\n4) Casino is pretty small.\n5) Rooms are poorly decorated. Looks like they haven't changed the style since the 1990s.
