The claim of \"farm to table\" and \"craft cocktails\" is mere lip service. My wife and dined there the this week and having just opened, they are pretty far away from being ready for prime time. The bar service was poor, appetizer came out lukewarm and the meal was less than okay. If you enjoy trying to get aioli on a limp frite, you found the right place. The sandwich featured a bun that I am pretty sure came out of Woodman's bakery section (pretty sure I use the same sub buns for kids lunches). The noodle bowl my wife ordered was lukewarm and flavors were not at all balanced. My wife said she felt like she had just smoked a cigarette, describing the aftertaste left in her mouth. It was a greater disappointment because the chef formerly worked under Dan Fox who sets a high standard for food quality and service. If you like old fashions, look elsewhere and expect an up-charge of $2 on a rail drink for an orange slice, maraschino cherry in a weak drink, muddling not included.
