It was astounding! How many Burritos can a Mexican roll if a Mexican can roll Burritos?  The answer to that riddle is as hard to fathom as how beautifully rolled and shaped as the Burrito de Barbacoa de Borrego($8.95) that was placed before me.  No spillage, no fall-overs, tight-knit, hand-on-pole diameter, balanced-ratio of fillings with nice blend of flavors.  Ay, caramba!   http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/xola-mexican-food-toronto?select=ZjChIyyAtPnp7HelCBeSlA#c1NeoS6uKRFN-qSYczKZbg\n\n...and as I smirk considering my choice of Menu Item had my friend clearly beat.\n\nAy Dios Mio!  Fish Tacos($15.00), I admit defeat on the first bite. The breading never became soggy after an extended time while the Basa fillet stays moist, along with some 'slaw, avocado and habanero mayo even the cheapass in me had to say it was worth every peso.   http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/xola-mexican-food-toronto?select=ZjChIyyAtPnp7HelCBeSlA#0GpytdQPh5uUFtAVQfIoqg\n\nNext time around, I'm going to savour the meal with a Rum & Coke - Mexican style.
