Love this beer festival!!\n\nIt was very very hot this year, otherwise I would have had Thor in tow. This is a great, well organized festival, and they have a sister wine festival! How fun! There was a good variety of breweries\/games\/food trucks. Jon B is right, it seems a little small but it really is a fantastic size - small enough not to miss any of the goodies, but big enough that you notice growth and have lots of options! There was a VIP section that had a little more shade and tables to sit down. Having a festival like this in an open lot is great, but tough on people who easily sunburn. Lots of people hiding under beer tents! \n\nI met Yoli at this festival, the bowtie wearing Great Dane and totally fell in love with him. Beer, food trucks, games, Yoli (true love), what more could you need?!
