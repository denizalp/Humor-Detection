Worst company ever. Chris and mike manipulate you into signing their contract so they can begin their work. Then you find out its not covered by your insurance and they threaten to sue you. Please if your reading this review do not go with them, and if its too late im sorry, i feel your pain. 1700$ bill to put a hole in my bathroom floor.
