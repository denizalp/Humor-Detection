I learned a valuable Yelp lesson by eating at Asia Lee yesterday. The lesson: Read reviews *carefully*. \n\nFlipping through them on Yelp mobile, I neglected to pay attention to the fact that one Yelper wrote about Asia Lee based only on its delivery service. And I overlooked the fact that the second review was fake. \n\nCompletely disarmed by the two 4+ star reviews, I walked in here and totally ignored the fact that I was the only person in the entire restaurant at 12:30 on a weekday. There are boxes stacked up everywhere in disorganized chaos. There is no waiter service. Some dude at the counter stared at me as I walked in, and I guessed that I was to look at the menu I spotted on the counter, make my selection, and tell him what I wanted. I ordered a szechuan chicken lunch special with a diet coke. I then sat at my table and waited, and only then realized what a foolish mistake I had made. Two other people did walk in. They looked like meth addicts. Or possibly a prostitute and her pimp. Or all of the above. \n\nThe soy sauce bottle was disgusting, sticky, and dirty. The food was adequate, even though it was presented to me on a cheap styrofoam plate. The decor appears as if the owners could care less what you think of the place upon setting your eyes on it. If the food was delivered to me at my doorstep so I didn't have to actually look at the rest of the restaurant and what condition it was in, I might think it was decent too. But alas, I had context. And that context, folks, is ugly. \n\nI will never come here again. I suggest you don't either.
