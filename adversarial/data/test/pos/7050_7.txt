Well more like 4.5 stars, those damn chairs have for sure earned negative points in my book. I'm all for intimate settings and all but when you're sitting next to a gentleman that's at least 6'2 and 250 lbs. there isn't room to squirm much less be actually comfortable. I guess I should still count myself lucky to have not sat next to someone with BO. The woman sitting behind my husband kept unintentionally?!?! hitting the back of his chair, it got really annoying after a while. Besides the seating fiasco, everything else was top notch!\n\nIt reminded me a lot like Rose Rabbit Lie but this one is 10X better, it offers a lot more cringe inducing moments. It definitely upped the ante on vulgarity and crudeness! 90 minutes of obscenity and bawdiness? What's not to love? Lol. For those of you that are not used to that kind of humor, leave your inhibitions at the door and you'll find yourself laughing your head off and enjoying the show very much. True, the Gazillionaire is a mad man who'll definitely burn in hell lol but it's all in good fun in my opinion. He's an equal opportunity hater! ;)\n\nIt's hard to pick a favorite among the acts, but I have to say the one with the roller skating duo tops my list. That took some serious talent! The whole time I was picturing the Lotus move from Will Ferrell's movie Blades of Glory, I was praying that no heads would come flying! Not good for the faint hearted hahaha. There must've been 10 plus acts total, every one applause worthy. The aerial acrobats were provocative and heart stopping. \n\nEchoing most sentiments here, if there's one show in Vegas that you MUST see, it's this one!\nI can't wait to bring our family from Hawaii to watch this show, this time we'll spring for VVIP tickets and sit in the elevated private tables to be comfortable.
