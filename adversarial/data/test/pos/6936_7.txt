Unfortunately, my experience at Vila Algarve did not measure up with the expectations the reviews on Yelp created. While the service was friendly, we walked in at 5pm and the restaurant was completely empty. Because the space is large, it made the experience a little eerie. Only one other table would show up within the hour or so that we were there.\n\nFor the food, we tried a cheesy tripe dish, portuguese sausage, and a chicken curry. Whether or not it was a bad night or the food quality has gone down, everything was quite bland. For example, the chicken in the curry tasted good at first, but once getting to the center of the chicken, it was basically tasteless. \n\nWe also got some complimentary bread and oil with balsamic vinegar, but even the bread tasted somewhat stale and flavorless.\n\nI do hope that the restaurant is able to find some success, but I simply wasn't impressed with the food that night. It actually reminds me of one of those restaurant rescue shows - they need to slim down the menu and focus on high quality choices because as of now they touch on too many different cuisines.
