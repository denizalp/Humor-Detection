Where else can you find a casino in an airport?  Where else can you gamble while waiting for your flight?  This airport is definitely one of a kind.  However, it does get busy and crowded but you don't get the headache-inducing, mood-killing feel that you would get with LAX or LaGuardia Airport in NY.  Even on a busy day, the security line looks deceiving because the line wraps around, but it actually goes pretty fast.  Aside from slot machines everywhere, there's several restaurants to choose from and free wi-fi.  This airport doesn't make you feel like you're waiting for your flight.  It makes air travel a bit easier and as one Yelper says, \"completes the Vegas experience.\"  \n\nI like this airport, and it's almost in the same ranks as SEA-TAC and SFO.
