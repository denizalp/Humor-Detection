GOOD NEWS!!! EVERYTHING IS A-OK!!\n\nIMPORTANT UPDATE\n\nAs you all know, I LOVE Palm Beach Tan. \n\nI went in before my trip last week to get a spray tan, and apparently my account had a $365 balance which I had no idea where it came from.\n\nANYWAY, long story short, Customer Service Agent Joseph called me this afternoon to say it was a total mix up and there's no balance!!\n\nWe are ALL GOOD AGAIN!!\n\nWhat an awesome result!! I can't wait to go back!!\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND
