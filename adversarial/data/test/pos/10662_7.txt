I simply love this place! A true hidden gem of the city with fantastic coffee and fresh food ! Baked goods are my personal favorite throughout the city of Toronto. A perfect place to grab coffee\/lunch\/study\/read etc. I gave The Hub a 5 star rating for a reason, not because it's easy to click or seem like a nice gesture but because of the consistency of coffee and food product and the fantastic service that they continue to put out. I cannot get tired of this place. Definitely my favorite cafe in the city!
