I have been to this indian place on Stanley street multiple times. They serve decent Indian food. And their lunch buffet is affordably priced at 16 cad for eating out in Montreal downtown. Although, I do not really like the taste of dishes they serve for the buffet. I usually prefer to order separately from their menu, as it much more tastier. Though, then your meal becomes very expensive. The service is also not above par, especially when compared to the rates they are charging. Brownie points: they have a very good wine collection.
