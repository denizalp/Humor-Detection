This is one of those reviews that starts out like \"I wanted to like this place BUT....\". Don't get me wrong, Andiron's nails the ambiance factor and presents visually stunning food, but I thought the food was mediocre. Basically, I was turned off by the heavy handed use of salt and capers in the food. Just FYI, I hate salt. I'm more of a pepper kind of girl. Anyways, my husband and I chose to eat at Andiron Steak & Sea to celebrate our 8 year marriage anniversary. I actually picked the place because the fanciness appealed to me and I loved that vegetarian options were offered at a steakhouse.  \n\nCOMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Two rolls that were flaky on the outside and airy on the inside were served with a side of seasoned butter. These were very salty (I think the butter had capers). I am all about bread baskets, but I couldn't even finish my roll. 2\/5\n\nANDIRON CAESAR ($12): I sampled some from my husband's plate. Again, very salty but capers were listed on the menu. I've come to the conclusion I hate capers. 2\/5\n\nPORK SCHNITZEL ($25): Visually pleasing and husband said it was \"pretty good\". I sampled the red wine cabbage served on the side and was surprised at how sweet it was. I called it dessert cabbage. 4\/5\n\nROASTED CAULIFLOWER STEAK ($23): This entree elicited ooohs and ahhs from the table next to us, but taste wise, fell flat. The giant mushrooms were super chewy and the vinegar dressing was too sour for my tastes. I wouldn't order this again. 2\/5\n\nMAC & CHEESE WAFFLE ($11): One of the most innovative things I've seen but dammit, why is it so salty?? 3\/5      \n\nVIBE: Open and airy, cloaked in mostly whites, and accented by small floral designs and shades of green. The crowd was of the refined type and were mostly older folks. I was impressed with the ambiance, that's for sure. 4.5\/5\n\nSERVICE: Eh. I was asked 3 times by 3 different people if I wanted something to drink besides water. By the third time, I was annoyed. My husband got a coke and it was perpetually empty, although the staff were quick to refill our water glasses. I felt like the server was trying too hard to up-sell us. 2\/5 \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nMy reasoning behind the 3 stars is this: If you're going to charge high prices for food, that food better be excellent. I don't know if I'll come back to Andiron because the chef in there is going crazy with salt and capers.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #111
