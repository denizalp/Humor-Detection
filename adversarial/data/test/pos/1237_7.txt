Raspberry Lambic.   Did you hear me?  Raspberry Lambic?  It's a burger joint with all the class and style of a downtown jazz club located in a strip mall across the street from a gelato shop.  It's a marriage of convenience to an ugly girl who really knows how to work it.  \n\nThe best things about Delux are its burgers and fries.  The fries, sweet potato and regular, are crisp, salty and delicious.  They are served in miniature shopping carts with the D for Delux emblazoned on the front.  Our server adorably quipped \"Fries A La Cart.\"  Heh...heh....ehhhhh.....they still tasted good. \n\nThe burgers are properly cooked to order and the meat is flavorful and satisfying.   I've been twice now and have yet to be disappointed.   My only beef (pun intended) with Delux is the lack of 1000 island dressing for my burger (I'm white trash like that).   However, the aioli which is spicy but still smooth makes up for the lack of 1000 as a substitute condiment.   \n\nThe beer list is extensive and the menus are adorable.  The outside patio is misted and looks out onto a nice view...well, for a road-side strip mall at least.  If you go during peak hours, expect a wait.   It's reasonably priced but still a $15\/head trip.
