Recently discovered by the Canadians, Moto roughly translated means \"don't eat sushi here, but everything else on the menu is great!\"\n\nMy first visit to Moto was several years ago when I had some sushi and sashimi items. My most vivid memory was ordering a Philadelphia roll and watching the sushi guy take an already made roll off the counter and cut it into pieces and serve it to me. I'm sorry, has that been there long? \n\nFlash forward to a month ago when my parents were at Matsuri and wanted a \"Japanese\" meal. I recommended Moto because it was the only place I thought would be open at 2PM on a Saturday. I was drawn to revisit it because they offer some interesting beer selections on draught. Well, they do, and it exposed me to a couple of interesting beers I'd not heard of. My folks wanted to order sushi, so I let them, and sure enough the rolls they ordered, as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good. Everyone at the table ordered entrees and we were all very happy. The build your own noodle bowls are great. I have been back a couple times since and really enjoy it every time. \n\nThe service here has been great every visit with a staff of girls all in their twenties that are hip, but not in an asinine way that some of these other types of places can be. Try getting a twenty something girl to show you any respect at Stingray, RA, etc. Ain't gonna happen, friend. I'm also impressed that they offer a great happy hour, especially Sunday when it is all day long. \n\nYep, Moto is a great place, as long as you don't order the sushi. The menu items are too good to pass up to order something that is sub-par or average.
