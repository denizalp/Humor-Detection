From the voyeuristic \"HE\/SHE\" bathrooms to the big-ass \"look at what you're missing\" windows, to the rotating and (usually) interesting art installments, the ambiance at AZ 88 boasts a sort of funky, yet arrogant sexuality that is unique. The crowd has seemed to be quite varied in my experience. But this is OTS, and the usual rules apply. \n\nThe current setup of art includes huge pseudo-abstract figures in Kama-Sutra-like sexual positions on the gigantic windows. One per window! It's sort of like a tutorial. I would imagine many a over-the-shoulder-sweater wearing aging socialite has gasped at the \"inappropriateness\" of this. Good. Gasp away, Maude. Props to AZ 88 for being dirty\/classy. \n\nThe food is not cheap, but not expensive either. It's completely accessible, even casual, which might be different than what some people would expect. But I totally get it. I mean, what's wrong with looking good and having a grilled cheese?\n\nPersonally, I would recommend AZ 88 as a place to get cocktails. The prices here are no more or less than any other equivalent restaurants\/bars in the area and they do great martinis. The wine list isn't anything crazy, but they do offer a somewhat hard to find but inexpensive Spanish red called Carchelo that is awesome. \n\nHighlight: Come here for drinks and to hang before going dancing to one of the more rowdier (or raunchier?) clubs in the area.
