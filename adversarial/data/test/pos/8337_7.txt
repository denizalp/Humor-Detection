The room was decent at best.  The staff was relatively nice but inept.  The conference planning was abhorrent.  \n\nThe food in the bar was adequate but overpriced.  The drinks were meh as well.  Asked for a slice of Avocado and apparently the kitchen is a few floors away (that's what I was told) because it took a full 20 minutes for the avocado.  Mediocre food, mediocre service, high prices.  Hmmm.  Avoid. \n\nThe rooms are dark and dingy with low ceilings. The bathtub looked like someone washed engine parts in it. The sink sprayed directly at the front of my pants. Just really bad for the price, location and expectations.  If I was paying $60 a night I would be ok with this place.  \n\nWe had a conference here and it was so poorly put together by this hotel that I wouldn't suggest or recommend this place to anyone under any circumstance.
