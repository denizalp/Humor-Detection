HELP! I need somebody, help! I'll take any body, can't you please, please help me?\n\nThis store is in an ideal location, considering the competition in the area. However...No salesperson approached me. I had to go begging, all the while wearing ill-fitting clothing that wasn't my norm. I needed someone to give me confidence that this shift in appearance wasn't as bad as it felt. \n\nOnce I did get someone, the woman was more or less as bit**y as one could imagine.   \nI needed to try dress shoes with the pants I was having tailored, and asked if I might try on a particular pair for that reason. She responded with \"Most people bring the right shoes.\" I responded saying \"I need to buy shoes to go with these new suits.\"\nShe explains that I can try on the shoes, but she doesn't know if I'll like the shoes they have for \"testing.\"  WTF? I can walk into a Payless and walk around in their store, but in Moore's, I have to wear \"testing shoes?\" \nI tried to make a joke about it; the look she returned suggested I'd passed offensive odors to her olfactories.\n\nI asked how long it would take to have the pairs of pants properly hemmed. She didn't know. She went and got one of the \"actual sales people, as she's just a helper.\" \n\nOK, same question for the salesman. He tells me 2, maybe 3 days. \n\"Could you please call me when they're ready so that I don't come in expecting them to be ready and they're not?\" He tells me he certainly will do so, writes down my phone number on a ticket.\n\nThat was nearly 3 weeks ago. I've called and left messages for my salesman; he's not responded. I'm sure the pants are done, but just out of spite, i'm waiting to see how long it takes til someone calls me.\n\nThe owner of this store should be embarrassed by the many negative reviews here on Yelp. they're well-deserved. I hope it pushes them into upping their game. \n\nThen again, the place is just arrogant enough to think that Yelp is just a place for whiners...
