The first thing that needs to be addressed is directed toward anyone who gives this place 3 stars or less. This is not a fancy sandwich shop...with that being said, don't come here expecting a sandwich piled 6 inches high that not even Fat Albert could finish. What you can expect is a good sandwich at a very decent price. \n\nThey are cash only and that is how they keep their costs low. There's an ATM in the lobby in case you forget to stop at the bank. \n\nI love the variety of sandwiches they have ranging from a basic croissant ham and cheese to a grilled pork on a freshly baked (in house) baguette. The pate pouches are super tasty and good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. \n\nThey have over 30 types of smoothies so you are sure to find a flavor you love or try a new one you haven't yet. My favorites are the avocado and taro ones. Sounds odd, but they are very refreshing! I can't wait to get back to Arizona to try new items!
