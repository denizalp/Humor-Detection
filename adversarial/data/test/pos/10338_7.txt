I usually do my own brazilian, and for anyone who has ever done that, you know it's not that fun (not that brazilians are fun in general, but you get what I'm saying!). I was super lazy this month and did not feel like spending half an hour torturing myself, so to the Birthday Suit I went. I had been here one other time but that was a while ago and I remember it being fine but I forgot to review it.\n\nAnyway, today I just walked in with no appointment and they said it would be about a half hour wait, but it was more like 20 minutes. My aesthetician was very friendly and didn't make it weird or awkward at all. No more than 10 minutes later I was done and out the door. Also as a plus, the place is very clean, quaint, and girly. My self-waxing days may be over.
