They should change the name from Joes seafood to Joes Pies, Because while the seafood and steak are below average there Pie(KEY LIME) made in house, is just perfection.\n\nI am not sure why they have such a high rating. Service was really good and the waiter knew his stuff the price-point is a bit high but quality of food is lacking!!!!!! \n\nThe bread they bring out as an appetizer was standard some pieces though tasted like hospital bread, you know the bread they serve in a plastic bag at the hospitals. NOT IMPRESSED. \n\nI ordered the Filet Mingon and I was not impressed more so disappointed ... I ordered it medium on the bone. Half the steak was cooked well and the inside was cooked medium.The filet was chewy at the end and not packed with that juicy flavor you suppose to get out of a filet. The ends toward the bone were very very fatty. POORLY COOKED FILET MINGON.\nThe swordfish was not good. Did not taste fresh and was a bit on the rubbery side. Just so wrong. The sauce that comes on top was flavorless. \n\nThe stuffed mushrooms with spinach were very good and tasted great, perfect play between cheesy and crunchy.\n\nI believe there specialty is stone crab but we didn't try it. Its supposedly these crabs that they tear off one claw and throw them back into the ocean....\n\nMy suggestion though is with a bill close to 160 dollars for food the quality of two entrees 2 deserts and a cappuccino did not deliver great quality food for value. \n\nTHE ONLY REASON I WOULD GO BACK IS FOR THERE AMAZING PIE. WHILE THE BANANA FOSTER IS GOOD THE KEY LIME PIE IS JUST HEAVEN ON EARTH MADE BY THE KEY LIME PIE GDS. ITS BEYOND AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of key lime pie and this is in the top two best key lime pies Ive ever had in my life. GO THERE AND JUST ASK FOR A SLICE OF KEY LIME PIE. They have a baker that comes in every morning and specifically bakes THE PIES. It delivers freshness and this thick graham crust, its scary to say PERFECT. \n\n\nKEY POINTS TO KNOW ABOUT SEATING: \n\nIF YOU ARE GOING THERE FOR DINNER EVEN AFTER I SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE WITH BETTER QUALITY FOOD AND YOU WANT THE WHITE TABLECLOTH DARK DINNER FEEL, WALK TO THE BACK......ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK. IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE MAN THAT SITS YOU IN FRONT HE WILL SIT YOU AT TABLES NEAR THE BAR AREA OR OUTSIDE BY THE FRONT WHICH IS GREAT FOR LUNCH BUT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE EAT DINNER OVERLOOKING MALL SHOPS EXPERIENCE FOR LATE DINNER.  SO JUST HEAD ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK.... The place is huge and there is more seating options than what you see. They have an upstairs and a romantic dim lit back room.
