I've used CLS for about the past three years. My firm typically attends several conferences each year in Vegas, and CLS has always done a good job for us in terms of car service. It's easy to make an on-line reservation, and the drivers show up on time and certainly know their way around Vegas. \n\nUnfortunately, I will not be using them again. During a recent stay at the Bellagio, I used CLS around 10-15 times. One of our partners made a reservation himself for some car service and used his AMEX. They charged him the correct price for the ride, but they also charged an additional $1700 in fees. \n\nWhen I contacted them to ask about the charge, it took me three tries before Christina finally responded and then she told me it was an error and I should dispute the charge with AMEX. Umm...you made the error, so you fix it. She then told me that their merchant account with AMEX had been shut down, so it was on me to get the money back.\n\nI promptly forwarded her email to Charlie, who owns the company, and he responded quickly and assured me that they would credit back the AMEX for the $1700. \n\nSomething shady is going on here, and after seeing all these other reviews, I will never use them again. \n\nSee ya around, Charlie!
