This place has only been open for about 3 weeks and I've already been here 4 times.  I've lived down the street from Hazelwoods for over a year and have also been there about 4 times. As you can see, I've decided on my walking-distance sports bar of choice.\n\nThey have a great, cheap happy hour that lasts until SEVEN. Which means I will never again risk death on the I-17 as I race home from work praying that I get to the Vig before 5:55 so I have enough time to order a drink and some hummus before prices go back up at 6:00. Instead, I will leisurely cruise on down to Zipps. Maybe I'll even stop at home first to change, something I would never even DREAM of when Vig was involved.  Zipp's freed me from the hell that is 4-6 Mon-Fri happy hour.\n\nThe $3 margaritas taste very much like the $6 Z Tejas 6th Street Margaritas. There's a limit of 3. I'm not sure if that's for cost control or safety liability, but 3 is enough to knock me on my ass, so I won't complain. The Golden Hot wings are amazing, and surprisingly hot. I would start with Golden Medium and then get a side of Hot if you think you can handle at. FYI: It makes people perspire.\n\nI've yet to have an actual meal here, just apps and drinks, but the menu items look tasty (I'm especially looking forward to trying the Sweet Jalapeno Burger) and if the execution is on par with the mouthgasm that is the wings, I'm sure I'll be satisfied.
