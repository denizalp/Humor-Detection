i have been a long time customer here at DJs but this summer has  gone way down hill.  I've heard of people being mis charged and didn't think much of it but I have caught several mistakes  recently.  I've noticed on several visits large bins of rotting fruits and veggies for sale.  They were selling commercial produce for much of the summer as well.  \n\nToday however I've reached the limit and will no longer be returning nor recommending this market to anyone.  Upon making my normal weekly visit I needed a couple dozen eggs for a project.  I needed large shells, so I sorted through the eggs and chose a couple cartons with  the largest eggs.  The owner thought I was switching eggs around in cartons and started yelling at me from across the market that I couldn't do so.  I told her I was just picking out cartons that I wanted and she said ok.  I then got into line and she continued to complain loudly to other customers and staff.  She then looked at me and told me she was going to charge double as other markets charge more.  The lady ahead of me in line turned to me  and told me I should just leave and not pay the extra.  I've know the owner and her son for several years and thought ok, she's having a bad day.  When I got up to her to pay I told her that I didn't appreciate her chastising me in front of everyone and  that she didn't need to be so rude especially to a longtime customer.  She proceeded to tell me how they only make 5 cents profit on the eggs and on and on and on, then started telling the man behind me as well.  It was such a mess I told her she can keep the eggs and I would no longer shop there.
