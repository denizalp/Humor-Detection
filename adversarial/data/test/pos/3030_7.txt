Pilot Coffee Roasters new, chic Ossington location is a hit. It's a huge, bright open space filled with coffee porn, light snacks and large coworking tables.\n\nThe staff is knowledgeable, the clientele is super snobby about their beans and if you want to be buzzing along with others as you work, pull up a laptop at one of these tables.\n\nBonus for carrying fresh pressed juices and cookies. I'm not much of a coffee person if we're being ruhl. I know, I know. Weird.
