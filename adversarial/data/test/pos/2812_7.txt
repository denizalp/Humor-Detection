This place rocks the breakfast world. It is so dang tasty. Today I went here with my two young monkeys (3 and 2) and were seated right away. The owner (who was very friendly and gracious) took us to a booth (perfect for kids). Then we met April.\n\nApril is amazing and probably one of the most friendly servers I have ever met (and I have met some servers). She understood what it was like to be me (she said she has 3 kids of her own) and promptly put in an order of Cinnamon Crunch French Toast for the ankle biters and brought me a piping hot cup of much needed coffee. A few minutes later I ordered an egg white omelet with bacon, avocado, tomato, cheddar cheese and onion. \n\nWhen the french toast came out (quickly I might add....thank the Lord) she had separated it for us on two identical plates with a fruit garnish for each child (therefore preventing WWIII). It was buttery, gooey, sweet, crunchy and super delicious. All you could hear was the kids masticating (I Love that word) on their breakfast. My omelet came a couple minutes after and I actually got to enjoy a few hot bites before they started getting squirmy (having hot food is such a blessing when you are a mom). \n\nI will always be a loyal patron of Rise and Shine...because of the food, service and the short short distance from my house. Thanks again April :)
