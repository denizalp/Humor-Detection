What I hate the most about a lot of Hair Salons is that they do not listen to the customers. The lady at the hair salon is the perfect example of what I'm talking about . I specifically asked for a haircut and I even showed her the picture. I showed her the picture twice and she insisted that I put the picture away.  Then it's as if she created her own haircut.  I will base my review on how accurate the haircut is.\n\nIf you do go, ask for someone else.
