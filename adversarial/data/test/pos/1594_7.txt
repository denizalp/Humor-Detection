As many times as I went back and forth between Phoenix and Boston for years to cook, I always only stopped into Ace to pick up new cheffy uniforms. They always have what I want -- and a lot of the time it's on sale!\n\nOn my most recent visit, I was able to pick up two new chef coats and a pair of scrub pants (more comfy than chef pants) all on sale. Everything was less than $40. Can't beat that!\n\nThey'll ask you for your email and keep you updated on specials. The staff genuinely try to help you out. While they specialize in law enforcement uniforms, they have a decent selection of scrubs, lab coats and cheffy wear too. They do tailoring and even embroidery work. Plus if they don't have it in the shop, they'll do their damndest to find it for you. I've always had a phenomenal customer service experience in here.
