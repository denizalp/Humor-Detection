First thing, that catches your eye while wondering around the fabulous Cosmopolitan hotel is this restaurant. At first look, it might be just another trendy bar with cute graffiti d√©cor (happy looking cows and chickens with smiles on their faces) but step in and look a little closer and you will realize that yes, this is a bar\/lounge in the front but in the back it is a full fledged running restaurant with tables and table-booths! \n\nWe decided to stop by and try this place out before we left Vegas (le sigh it is always hard to part with such an awesome city). The hostess were very sweet and little ditsy but heck they made us laugh! \nWe were seated right away which was impressive at almost 5:30pm on a weekday. The lounge\/bar area was busy and so was the restaurant. \nWe settled into our table-booth, which was comfortable even though we were sandwich in-between, two other parties, we were handed our menus. This place has almost everything you could ask for:\n\nShakes (bam -boozled shakes)\nIPA's\nBeer\nWine\nOne of a kind cocktails\n\nBut what I liked most was the free tin of freshly popped popcorn they bring to your table along with large ketchup and mustard bottles. Who knew that ketchup or mustard would taste so good on popcorn!\n\nAll their burgers are made to order and are fresh, natural with organic ingredients!\n\nWith so many options on their menu, it was hard to choose just one burger. \n\nI decided on the Nom Nom Burger- No bun, Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing\n\nI have to admit I was never the kind if girl to put potato chips or even fries on my burgers. I use to watch my friends do it and think it probably tastes weird! But screw that though I told myself I'm going in!\n\nAfter ordering, it does take awhile and patience is a total virtue, that is when people watching takes place! And believe me it is a fun place to watch all the out of water tourists!  One guy was seated at a table next to us and was told he could not have his large hurricane glass at the table. You would have thought he was told that there was no strip clubs in Vegas! He tried to tell the hostess that he was not going to drink it, not believing him she told him that she would hold it up at the front for him. Still the look on his face was priceless!\n\nOur burgers came out larger than life (or maybe that was my hunger talking) I had to try some of Minh's onion rings (which were delicious) I could have ate them all except I was given the \"eye\" so I swiped two more and went back to my burger! \n\nIt was the perfect burger, cheesy with just the right amount of dressing and chips! The burger was wonderful, full of flavor not a dry bite at all!\n\nBe warned their burgers do fill you up fast, even though I opted not to have the bun I got full half way through! I forced myself to finish this epic burger, which I am 50\/50 that I did. 50% happy because it was yummy, the other 50% was left being uncomfortable for a while as my burger settled in my tummy! \n\nService was great, and the prices were decent for being on the strip!
