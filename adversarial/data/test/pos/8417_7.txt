This place has some mad expensive bikes. Velorbis and Herskind+Herskind models hang on their bare white walls like two-wheeled artwork. Seriously gorgeous stuff that reminded me of Dutch girls in long skirts, light rail, scarves-in-every-season and other chunks of Europeanness. The store stocks sturdy commuters with thick white wheels, speedy fixed- and single-gear bikes, accessories (though not a tonne of stuff) and they also have a shop in the back for repairs.\n\nWhile I'm not presently in the market for a four-figure bike, I appreciate what they have. For now I will covet their items lustfully and from afar.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: The first COUT is the deepest. (I got nothing.)\n\nMenu Readability: |\\| . \/-\\ .\n\nNeed to mention: Their stellar orange buttons are $2 and support a good cause. You know, if you're into buttons.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Baby, I'll try to love again but I knooowwwwww...
