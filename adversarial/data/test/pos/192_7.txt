I've been here sooo many times, but I always forget to write a review because I'm so focused on rushing back to work and chowing down on their green chile burrito, enchilada style. This is what I order EVERY time I'm here. This thing is MASSIVE!!!! It's not that spicy, but it certainly has a little kick to it. It is absolutely delicious and I hate that I love this place so much.\n\nRito's is a local, family owned joint. This place gets crowded during lunch hour and there's very, very limited waiting room inside as well as very limited parking. There's a small private lot as well as street parking. There are a few shaded eating tables outside for those who enjoy burning in the lovely Arizona heat, but there are zero tables to eat indoors.\n\nIf you usually take your lunch at noon, I recommend calling in your order in advance or placing it online! \n\nI'm gonna miss Rito's!
