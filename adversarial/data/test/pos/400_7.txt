Hello Gorgeous!  There's a makeup counter, so if you just want to buy yourself a little something like a lipstick, compact or perfume without the giant splurge come here! It's located inside the Wynn Hotel.\n\nWhile you're here enjoy browsing at the most luxurious and most popular brand in the world! Shoes, bags, accessories, lots of \"wow\" moments for me in this beautiful store. \n\nNo pretty woman treatment either! That's a bonus because there are some serious beooootches at other fine retailers. Thank you Chanel for treating me like a lady!
