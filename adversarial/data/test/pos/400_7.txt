My usual reviews are almost entirely focused on the food and drinks but for Marble Room I was most struck by the ambiance and the service.\n\nWe had reservations last Saturday and were looking forward to it after seeing what Crop Bistro did with a similar setting and we weren't disappointed in the renovations that restored an old bank building to a truly stunning dining room. The opulence and the size was built to impress bank visitors more than 50 years ago and it does the same for diners now.\n\nAnd the staff is trained to match that initial impression. The servers worked as a team and always showed utmost professionalism while still having the friendliness to give us a relaxed dining experience. It reminded me of some of the restaurants with Michelin stars we've eaten at.\n\nThe trained staff extended to the bartenders as our drinks (especially my old-fashioned) were perfectly mixed with each ingredient complementing the others. They have a very extensive wine list but we stuck with cocktails after seeing how good the first round was.\n\nOne of the appetizers we had was a crab cake that seemed to have almost no filler and which came with a perfectly tart sauce that cut through the heaviness of the cake. The second appetizer was a foie gras that ended up being the only misstep of the night. The meat was perfectly cooked and the seasonal jam that came with it is exactly what is required when eating foie but it also came on a funnel cake -- powder sugar and all! The light batter just did not pair well with the heavy liver. An \"A\" for imagination and creativity but I'm afraid a much lower grade for concept.\n\nBut that was soon forgotten with the main courses as my wagyu skirt steak with truffled fries was perfectly cooked and seasoned while Jeannene's 6-ounce filet was seasoned even better --the salt and pepper just singing on the tongue. We also had a side of creamed spinach which was also quite decent. We were with two other people who had the chicken breast Tuscan style and the Berkshire pork chop and they both had high praise.\n\nWe didn't want our visit to end so we tried a couple of desserts, neither of which sounded like the lightest of desserts but the pastry chef knows they will be following main courses full of some massive hunks of meats. One dessert was a strawberry shortcake that looked elegant but still tasted like a grandmother whipped it up while the second sweet treat was the madarin orange cheesecake which was soft and creamy and which we smeared through dots of very tart yuzu and orange sauces on the plate -- very tropical.\n\nSo, yeah -- 5 stars
