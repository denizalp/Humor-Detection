I really dont know what all these positive reviews are for. Not sure if i came on a slow night or what but it seemed like it was a half fast job. They had the idea right but presentation was a huge disappoinment. I didn't expect to walk into a strip club but the impression that i from instagram was that it would be kind of a chill place to hang out; somewhat similar to a hookah lounge with out the hookah, obviously. The tea was okay; not much flavor, the boba was really sweet & there was a whole lot of ice to fill the cup. I paid 20 dollars for two bobas. There was only one girl in there & she looked half done too. Sorry not sorry. She was really nice but she looked like she just woke up, hair in a pony tail, & said \"Okay time for work\". I felt like I was cat fished. Definitely not coming back. Waste of time & money.
