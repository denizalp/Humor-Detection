Not great. That would be the summary words. \n\nSatay was processed. Not fresh. \nPad kee Mao was salt + soy sauce + msg with a small dash of chicken and noodles. I think I drank about 6 glasses of water due to this dish. 1\/5\nGinger chicken was bland and also not fresh. Not as offensive to the palette as the pad kee Mao. 2\/5\nPineapple fried rice was over salted and over peppered. 2\/5\nYellow curry was sweet and a welcome authenticity to the meal. 4\/5\n\nService: 4\/5\nCleanliness: 4\/5\nValue for money: 3\/5
