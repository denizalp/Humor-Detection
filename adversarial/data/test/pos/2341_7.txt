A coffee shop is good when...\n\n1. they serve delicious caffeinated beverages \n2. they offer tasty treats to soothe your hunger pains\n3. they provide sufficient room to get work done. \n\nRoyal at the Market offers all three. The coffee is creamy, and full of a caffeinated kick which is the perfect boost to the day. I like iced coffee and enjoy their iced latte here. They have plenty of pastries to munch on and more important, the Downtown Public Market is just a step through a pair of doors. Finally, they have plenty of seating where it's easy to get work done. They have community tables as well as individual high tops. They also have a back room with seating as well.  \n\nBetween the Market and Royal at the Market, this is an ideal spot to visit for a beverage and to do some work and I like to visit as often as I can.
