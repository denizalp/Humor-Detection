Funny thing happened on the way to the Strip. We stopped at B.A.R. to pre game and put a little grease in our bellies for the long night of disrespecting our livers. \n\nOne word... sliders. Everything from traditional angus patties to pot roast sliders... Uh yeah - pot roast sliders! Everything was off the chain including the... Wait for it... Wait for it... Sweet potato tots! I mean damn! Who is the genius that took sweet potato fries to the next level? Bravo sir or ma'am... BRAVO! The prices are very reasonable and the service was great. Even on football Sunday it wasn't packed but far from dead. I will be back!
