NEVER WILL I GIVE THIS PLACE MY BUSINESS AGAIN. First the staff is rude and unfriendly. The customer is always wrong is the motto that this place teaches. To print a document be prepared for an outrageous up charge to just send a document. This day in age when I have a ton of options to print, I will gladly go some where else that treats customers with respect and courtesy.
