After the poor experience at the G-Easy concert, the Park Theater reached out to me to make things right.\n\nWe returned to the Park Theater for Post Malone, and it was far more organized. In addition, security personnel were respectful and the lines moved in an efficient manner. The many problems we experienced at the previous concert had been remedied.\n\nThank you Park Theater! I appreciate you valuing your customers and listening to our feedback.
