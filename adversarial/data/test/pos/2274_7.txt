Unlike most people who come here just to see the characters from the TV show or buy a TV t-shirt and then write bad reviews because the TV characters weren't there, I actually came here with cash in my pocket trying to buy something that the shop featured on the TV show a few weeks ago.  \nI knew to come late in the evening (after 7pm) to avoid the crazy line in front to get in.  Most of the employees I saw were busy showing different jewelry or guns to customers, and I finally found an employee to ask about the specific item (a framed photograph that the shop bought on the TV show).  The employee I asked was COVERED in Nazi and white supremacist tattoos, including SS lightning bolts, various other white supremacist symbols and letter\/number codes.  I don't care what kind of business you run, having an employee with these tattoos is unacceptable.  \nDespite the tattoos, I asked the employee about the picture, and he had no idea what I was taking about and just told me to look around the shop ( I already did that and only asked him after I couldn't find the picture on the wall).  I next went to a few employees who were taking near the back, where the desks are.  I asked them about the same picture, and they just blew me off saying \"if you don't see it, we can't help you.\"  If they realized that I actually had cash in pocket that I was willing to spend there, maybe they would have bee motivated to help me find the picture, or look in the inventory to see if it was in the back warehouse.  \nOh well, I'm glad I didn't spend my money in a store that employees Nazi and white supremacists.
