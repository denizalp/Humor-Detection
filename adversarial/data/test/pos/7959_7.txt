duck-rabbit is now open for business. Come to the shop and drink up. You have had the rest now try the best. Rising Star Coffee is now the Setting Sun. Very reminiscent of when Steven Seagal played Detective Gino Felino in Out For Justice and avenged the death of his partner Bobby Lupo. Welcome to the neighborhood duck-rabbit coffee.
