Came back to use up the rest of my gift certificate.  last time I was at the east location, this time I'm at the West location.  Another extremely busy Sunday i guess.  Felt like a cheap public swimming pool for ladies only.  Except it cost $150 (including massage).  \n\nNever again.  I just don't get how you charge so much and you can't even supply a plastic cup for water.  Ugh.
