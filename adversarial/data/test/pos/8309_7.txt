I admit to being pretty surprised. I've had better pizza in Cleveland but this was very solid and would certainly try it again. \n\nWould like to address the reviewer who felt it appropriate to give one star and claim Donatos food made her ill. While that very well may have been the case (hey, things happen. I got food poisoning from a 5 star NYC restaurant once), it seems somewhat irresponsible to make that claim without a few more facts, i.e. was the pizza the ONLY food she'd eaten that day? If not, then unless she's a medical professional or food scientist I'd have to call her claim specious at best and slanderous at worst. \n\nBottom line is Donatos serves a good product at a fair price. Don't be misled by a review which very well may not reflect what it states, plus it's over three years old.
