No, we didn't come her for Valentine's Day dinner (mind you I think Vday is lame and fake); we came for our Anniversary dinner. \n\nDidn't necessarily want something romantic but, I did want something different and super old school. And after recommendations from my boss, this sounds like it could be as Super OG as can be! \nAnd after looking at other restos I wanted to try, I think this place had the most bang for the buck AND THEY HAVE RACK OF LAMB (my fave!) \n\nRight in the cellar of Four Queens, lies this little gem of a restaurant! \n\nAfter getting our romantic drink of Hennessy on the rocks, we ordered the shrimp scampi, lamb, and rib eye.\nInitially, we wanted to order the appetizer of hot rock but, our waiter (Glenn) said he didn't recommend it as it was a lot of food that we were ordering already -- hence the shrimp scampi switch up! \nAnd our waiter was on the dot about that. \n\nThe table side salad that came with our meal was delicious. I love salad so I could've had him come around once more :) \n\nMy lamb was fantastic. Not too many places have lamb so this was exciting to me. Other steak houses make their lamb toooo salty for me so, this was perfect. Not salty at all and was amazing with the tasty mash potatoes and veggies. \nThe Indonesian sauce it came with was tasty, but I liked my lamb just the way it was. \nThe BF, actually, took my sauce for his rib eye which he found delish! \n\nAfter entrees, we got a complimentary cake and ice cream and their standard fruits dipped in chocolate. It was very nice! \n\nEnded the night with their Kona coffee brewed tableside. That was definitely the high light for the BF as he's a HUGE coffee drinker. \nThe more it boiled and brewed the more amazing our area smelled. Coffee accouterments of cinnamon sticks and mint chocolate was unexpected and yummy! \n\nService was awesome! Ambiance was vintage and really OG. Like this is where Frank Sinatra used to go. That's craaaazzzyyyyyy! \n\nI'd love to come back with a bigger party so, I can enjoy this place again :) Downtown Favorite for sure!
