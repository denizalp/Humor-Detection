The manager of this business contacted me via Yelp.  He expressed concern about my bad experience and invited me to try them again.  I appreciate such a response.  One star added and review slightly edited.  Please note this review was written a few years ago now and it seems like they are trying to do better.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nThey had one vehicle near the entrance to the lot with 2888 on the front window.  Wow, I thought that's a good deal for a black ford ranger with mud tires.  The guy said that's not the price it's the maximum down payment they require from people with really bad credit.  \n\nI was helping my sister in law look for a new car.  She had already run her credit at another dealership that we ended up not buying from earlier in the day.  The Baja Auto Sales guy wanted to run her credit first thing when we got there.  I guess all car salesman do.  The difference was with this guy when we declined to have her credit run he declined to help us saying \"You give me something-let me run your credit- then I will help you out...\"  \n\nBasically he saw that he was not going to be able to hussle us into a car in 30 minutes or less so he wasn't interested in coming out of the A\/C.  \n\nWe took our business elsewhere.
