So, as a part-time resident of the Manulife Residences, I have to start my day by stepping foot into this mall on many occasions. While it ain't exactly my choice to be greeted by a billion old folks and their walkers each morning, I know I should be thankful of the Manulife Centre.\n\nIt has everything I need! Too bad only half of it is the price I want to pay for it (LCBO and Post Office)... the rest? Clearly situated here to rob the old people who are not able to travel any further of their old money (Valu-mart, Ron White - hey have you ever heard of $900 shoes? Right here, at Ron White). Also, the mall seems to forget that there are patrons younger than the age of 60 who may need groceries and alcohol beyond 8pm, but they leave Indigo open in case you have a burning itch for some literature at 10pm. Makes sense, right? =\/\n\nAlways good to be able to connect to a TTC station without venturing out into a potential blizzard, I guess.
