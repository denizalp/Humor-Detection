How long have the Bobcats been playing here? Last night was my first time to the Arena and my first basketball game! A friend from out of town (a Cavaliers fan, go figure) picked up some great tickets and asked if I would be interested. Heck, yes!\n\nMild security at the gates with a few people running wands and checking for metal. And then a ticket check inside. No big hassle, but then we were an hour early to get to the amazing buffet that came with our tickets. Really good food, but I don't know if they do that often or what.\n\nFrom the Founders level, our seats were excellent, just over one of the corners of the court. We could see everything from there. I think that even the \"nosebleed\" seats would do pretty well here too.\n\nSignage is good and there are plenty of helpers around to point you to your section and your seats. I found the restrooms to be spaced out appropriately and the one I visited was pretty clean, even during halftime.\n\nPrices. Yeah. $40 for four beers. How does that happen? And these weren't premium pours. Just draft Budweiser in a 20 ounce plastic cup. Crazy!\n\nWe took the Light Rail to get here. Awesome ride getting in, the Arena is right next to the station. Getting back, I would recommend you pop over to the Epicenter for a beer and let the crowds drain a little before getting back on board.\n\nGo Cats!
