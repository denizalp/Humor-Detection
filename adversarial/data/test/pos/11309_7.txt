Vegas Valley Winery is the first of it's kind in Clark County and, in fact, the only winery in the Las Vegas Valley. The laws were changed earlier in 2017 to make way for a local winery and this local is tickled Rosé! \n\nNevada wine, with grapes primarily sourced from the nearby Amargosa Valley has been expertly handcrafted into beautiful wine to enjoy by the glass. Whimsical White (dry, crisp & delicious), Subtle Blond Riesling (a sweet white), Las Rosa Rosé (sweet but not aggressively sweet), Syrah (loved this beautifully balanced red) and Zinfandel (fruity, complex, my favorite) are the local selections. \n\nThis winery is owned by (and right next door to) Grape Expectations School of Wine. Ask for a tour and enjoy meeting the nicest, funny & approachable people you will ever have the pleasure of knowing. Also of note, they are in the Henderson Booze District. You can make a whole night of it and check out Craft Haus Brewery, Bad Beat Brewery, and maybe you will get lucky and be able to poke around the Las Vegas Distillery, too! They are all there.
