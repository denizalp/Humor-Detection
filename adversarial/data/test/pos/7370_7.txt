Ah, Corky's.... It seems like most cities in the U.S. have more karaoke hosts than regular DJs, but for some reason this area lacks many seven night a week karaoke spots.  Corky's Place is one of the two or three options around, and it would be a decent choice even somewhere saturated with karaoke options.\n\nThere isn't anything particularly unusual about Corky's but it gets a lot of things right. Corky's has a great selection of songs (accessible via one of three iPads in the back), the sound is better than one might expect for a dive, and staff is generally friendly and engaging. The regular karaoke host (Brandon?) manages the show well and isn't one to steal the show with long-winded jokes or excess singing of his own, like many hosts tend to do.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt that the layout and possibly too friendly patrons of Corky's remind me of The Beacon Pub, one of my favorite karaoke spots in Seattle that shut down a few years ago: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-beacon-pub-seattle\n\nThe only downsides to Corky's are the lack of food and a pesky $.50 fee for using credit cards. Corky's has a kitchen and advertises pizza, but I think I have only seen the kitchen open once (but that could be coincidental based on when I go.) I also doubt that the food situation is a real problem for most people. As far as the credit card fee, it doesn't get charged enough for me to remember that such a fee exists, so it ends up being an unpleasant surprise when it happens.\n\nWithout the fee (or some kind of a warning) I would probably rate Corky's as five stars. Otherwise, Corky's is great and I will keep coming back.\n\nIf you like to sing, arrive early on the weekend as the rotation fills up fast and you could be in for a long wait.
