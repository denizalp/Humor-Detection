Marci is seriously the QUEEN of eyebrow threading! \n\nEyebrows \"frame\" the face and in the beginning I wasn't sure what kind of shape I wanted (if I wanted it thin or thick, straight or have an arch, etc). Marci has a keen eye and knew exactly what would flatter my face. Now my eyebrows are on \"fleek\" and I have a better sense of direction when I fill them in. \n\nThe other staff are amazing as well, I get my upper lip threaded and they do it quick\/clean. They already know me as a regular, and I am asked if I want coffee or water when I arrive. Overall, their service is amazing, the inside is clean, and they have great designer handbags\/products for reasonable prices.
