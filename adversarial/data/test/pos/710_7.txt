Good news!  Maribel has a new home and is now open here at 4 Play Sunset! It's inside a bar again too. You'll find it right across Sunset Park and nearby Sunrise Coffee. The same sweet family still runs the place also. \n\nFor first timers here, the guacamole made in house is the bomb! So fresh. Very popular.  So don't get upset if it's sold out for the day. That's the first thing my family and friends that I bring here spread the word to their friends about. \n\nMy favorite is shrimp ceviche.  Again so fresh and light. I recall in my review from their original location my favorite is ordering shredded beef burrito wet topped with green sauce. Thanks to Sam, the young but super awesome server that suggested it.\n\nIm liking the new digs more than the original location.  The 4 Play place is more modern looking and cleaner,  It was not smoky on this visit.  The restaurant section is enclosed.  When you walk into bar, Maribel's will be to your left. The dining area is smaller, but seats about the same number of people.That's because there's no pool table or game tables taking up space like the original place.\n\nI wasn't on full Yelp mode since I was busy catching up with my friend Jamie on this visit. So I'll leave it up to you super Yelpers out there to snap up more pix and post! \n\nFor the most part menu is still the same.  The specials are only offered Monday - Friday though. The prices still reasonable too. Food tastes the same.  Good stuff! So make your way here if you want some good home cooked meal!
