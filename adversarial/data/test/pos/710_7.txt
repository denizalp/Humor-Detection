I love local run shops! I love when the owners are friendly with their cliental. This was my 1st time to Yoko, but I have to say I'm sure it won't be my last!   \n\nI ordered the orange chicken bowl, and now if you're thinking panda express chicken man you are off base. This is fresh orange chicken, with slices of fresh orange rinds in the sauce. It was a clean orange taste, very delish!  Was impressed.
