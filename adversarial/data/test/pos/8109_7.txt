Spoonful reminds me of a low to mid end hotel buffet in Hong Kong.  Essentially, if you're after high quality, do not pass Go, do not collect $200, and skip all buffets.\nIf you're looking for a large variety with relatively good quality though, then Spoonful is the place to be! \n\nHigher quality than that certain ubiquitous, chain-owned buffet, Spoonful seems to be the brainchild of a think tank run by children that answered the question of \"What do you wish you had unlimited access to?\"  The answers are pretty awesome: a gummy candy bar, no less than four soft serve ice cream machines, a multi-tiered chocolate fountain, and a baby doughnut machine. Seriously guys, baby.  Doughnut.  Machine.  For the adults, a seafood bar on ice offering raw scallops and raw oysters on the half shell, cold crab legs (also served in the hot food bar), and the rarely-found sea whelk.  I heard the octopus pieces were pretty tasty too.  \n\nGreat ideas, pretty good in execution, but ultimately it's still buffet food.  The roast beef was really tough, and no amount of gravy (offered in a dark, thick option or in the liquidy, \"light\"\/jus form) could hide it.  Crab legs are smaller than from the ubiquitous Mandarin and their shells are somehow on the softer side.  On the plus side though, they offer melted butter in a heated soup pot, which some buffet places strangely skimp on.  Fruits seemed fresh. I liked that they keep some miniature desserts in cafe-style counter-top glass cases, making cream puffs and egg tarts feel much fancier.  The salad bar is a bit sad, nobody really gets anything from it, as evidenced by the dried-out proscuitto slices. Stir-fried clams with black bean sauce! Another rare buffet item. Not enough \"wok-hei\" to make it delish, but meh, AYCE right?  \n\nCrowd was pretty good when I visited, as people actually lined up and didn't hoard food - way less stressful than going to an Asian grocery store!
