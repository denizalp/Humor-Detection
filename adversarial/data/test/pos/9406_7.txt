Horrible \"customer service.\" I wish I would have read the reviews before staying here.\n\nWe booked the room for two nights, Friday and Saturday. The first night went by just fine, uneventful. The second night, we got back to our hotel after a day out (thankfully!)  just in time to have the sheriffs show up and evacuate the hotel and close off the building with yellow caution tape. No one could tell us what was happening, so my husband was quick thinking and packed all of our belongings and we evacuated with everything in tow. Even the sheriffs said we would be able to return the same night, \"no problem.\"\n\nThat was about 7pm...3 calls to the front desk later with no answers or empathy whatsoever from the staff and the final call I made at 12am they advised us to finally plan on making other accommodations for the night. (I know the hotel was not in control, this is an issue about how the dealt with the situation afterward.)\n\nI left off saying we would discuss in the morning about how to handle the situation after everything blew over.\n\nIn the morning, I called in asking how they were going to compensate us for the inconvenience (again, I know they had no control BUT it is their responsibility to deal with the aftermath\/repercussions. That is what customer service is.) The manager left a voicemail saying they felt that it was \"more than generous\" for them to comp the night WE COULDNT EVEN STAY THERE but that was all, nothing more.\n\nSeriously? It is not \"more than generous\" to not charge me for a room I wasn't even allowed to stay in..I had to make alternate accommodations and call other hotels and check in after midnight somewhere else, let alone put up another deposit and pay more for the night elsewhere than my budget allowed. All of this caused us to get a late start the next day and snowball in getting stuck in traffic, etc.\n\nIrritating. Do not stay here unless you know your trip will go PERFECT and you do not need to discuss anything with management because they are of no help and do not provide customer service in the slightest bit.
