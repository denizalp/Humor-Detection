When I think of sports bars I envision pitchers of beer, hamburgers, more TV's than you can count, team memorabilia, life size cardboard cutouts of Shaquille O'Neil that scare the shit out of you when you turn the corner, shoddy service, janky menus, video games, tons of dudes and the token girl who pretends to be into sports.. Horse & Hound delivered and will provide you with all of the above. Two rooms of it even.. this joint is huge! They even have one of those claw games, but instead of being full of cheapy stuffed animals or 6 year old snickers bars, there were lobsters in it. Live lobsters that you can catch and have them cook.. no I did not do this.. I had nachos instead.\n\nI am adding a star for the sheer fact that they had an area devoted to the Red Sox (Yes all you Yankee fans can unfriend me and kiss my ass), another star for the shuffleboard table. I freakin love shuffleboard with a passion.. wasn't sure why it was situated directly underneath the 17 big screens, perhaps for the attention whores out there? Whatever, bravo anyway.\n\nThis place is great for all you sports fans.. literally, every sport was playing on one of the 50 TV's and they will put your game of choice on the large flat screen front and center if you ask nicely, or tip well.. Either or.\n\nP.S. Its also great for off-site betting ;o)
