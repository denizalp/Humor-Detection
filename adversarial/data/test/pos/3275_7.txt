I spend some time every Saturday at Whole Foods, selecting organic, locally grown greens, fresh fish, cage-free chicken, and gluten-free grains at a store whose management really cares about giving back to the community and treats its employees well. This allows me to feel really good about myself so I can justify all the sitting on my ass and smoking.
