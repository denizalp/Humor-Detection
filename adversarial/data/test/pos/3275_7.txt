I would give zero stars if that's possible.  These guys are bunch of cheaters. I had signed a rental contract with them and had to back out a couple of days later. They said they had no issues cancelling the contract and would completely return the entire security deposit to the renter if the renter agreed to back out of the lease. \n\nAfter compensation to the renter,  I had asked the renter's warehouse to return the security deposit and they declined to return. I had to pay out of pocket another 2400$ to the renter for their security deposit apart from the compensation. \n\nThese guys are bunch of cheaters and liars!!! Terrible customer service. I tried to get a hold of their broker through their agent but was not able to at all.  \n\nI have never ever given a bad review to any individual or entity but this is my first time. Will not recommend this Company to even my worst enemies.
