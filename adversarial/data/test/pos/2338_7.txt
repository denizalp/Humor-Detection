This dog park is pretty cool. Since I live near here I bring Kaipo to play with other dogs. I like that there's 2 separate areas for the different dog sizes.\n\nDuring the summer, there isn't much shade for people & dogs and it gets pretty hot. \n\nDuring the winter sometimes the water fountains don't work.
