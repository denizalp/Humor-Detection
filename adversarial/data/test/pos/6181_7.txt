If you like fresh, this is the place for you. The burgers are made fresh not frozen and cooked to order. The toppings are cut fresh daily. My wife and I stopped in for lunch after reading Yelp reviews.\nThe menu boasts several signature burgers with specific toppings for a specific price. The other option is to build your own which is what I did. After choosing your meat, ( beef, chicken breast, or turkey) you have the option to add cheese at an additional cost. I chose cheddar. I also made my meal a lunch combo. This gives you potato wedges and a soft drink with your burger.\nAfter about 10 minutes my order pager went off. My burger was hot, juicy, and cooked to perfection sitting on a toasted bun topped with gooey cheddar cheese. Off to the topping table. Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, relish and more. With all these fresh toppings this towering burger barely fits on your plate not to mention in your mouth. (hint) Use a knife and fork. The potato wedges are freshly made and deliciously seasoned. My only disappointment is that they didn't offer hot sauce at the condiment bar.\nThis newly discovered gem is just down the street so I'm definitely looking forward to my next dining experience here.
