I'm just going to say this place was sheer disappointment after it was so highly spoken of to me. When I think of my beloved Japanese food and sushi, I think of fresh ingredients, clean taste palate, and beautiful presentation. It's hard to mess up presentation, so I will give them that. However the other two factors.... swing and a miss. The calamari roll was chewy and the squid batter made up half of the portion. Seriously, it was a side of calamari with all the breading. Then there was the jalapeno roll. That roll is essentially why I give this place two stars. A jalapeno roll is my absolute favorite. I love the crunch of raw jalapeno and the slight spice it gives to fish. So simplistic and perfect!! Shuhei though, they used pickled jalapenos. Like the ones they put on nachos at a sports bar. There is a time and place to used pickled jalapenos, and it is not in my sushi roll. \n\nPlus, there was the usual slow service that everyone else pointed out. I thought maybe they have increased their tempo over the months\/years, but the answer is no. No they have not. Still expect slow service when you go here!
