Went here for a few drinks and tapas with because Roger T was being a punk...and some were dandruff FLAKES!  The place is rather small but it was nice and clean.  \n\nWe were given a Japanese slaw while waiting for our food.  We pretty much ordered 2 of each item on the menu: sasami, tomato caprese, ika butter, ham katsu, tori kara-age, koro koro steak, beef tataki, chawanmushi, enoki bacon, mochi bacon, asparagus bacon, butabara kushi, hamachi jalapeno, grilled veggies, aburi shime saba (mackerel), skewers (chicken, pork and wings), green tea waffle, and matcha affogato.  The price wasn't bad.  We ended up paying $180 for 3 people and we ordered a lot of food.  The girls I was with gave up so I had to clean up the mess we started.  My favorites were anything with bacon, koro koro steak (so tender), green tea waffle combined with the matcha affogato.  Delish!!!\n \nThe service was excellent. I find no reason not to come back!
