I am appalled by the customer service I experienced at this establishment on the morning of April 7, 2013, with a server by the name of Charlie.  This was my first experience eating at a restaurant on the Las Vegas \"strip\", and now I know why.  As a server myself for over 10 years, I am all too aware of the ins and outs of the job of a server. \n \n          My first complaint is how on Gods Green Earth can a restaurant located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip not serve BREAKFAST after 11:00am!? You are aware that there is an abundance of alcohol served in Las Vegas. There is also the possibility that the patrons of your restaurant may be experiencing the after effects of said consumption of vast amounts of alcohol, such as sleeping in past 11:00am and all they want is a great breakfast and some strong coffee, and from your menu it appears that your establishment does in fact serve a great breakfast, but only till 11:00 am!  WHY THE HE LL  DO YOU STOP SERVIGN BREAKFAST AT  11:00?!?!?   That is just despicable! \n\n           My second complaint is the utter lack of care and concern taken with our table once our order was taken. When our food was delivered I just happened to be in the restroom with my daughter. There were two orders of Steak and eggs delivered to our table, the food runner neglected to ask who had the order of steak Medium Well with the eggs cooked over medium. When I returned to the table, I realized right away that I had been given the wrong order of a Rare steak and eggs cooked sunny side up, I am pregnant and can not eat my steak rare, nor can I stomach my eggs sunny side up, which is exactly what I had in front of me. My friend who had clearly been given my order of a Medium Well steak and eggs over medium was clearly disappointed with his (MY) order, which he had already eaten half of. I went ahead and just switched plates with my friend and ate the rest of my half eaten meal. I did not have the time to waif for a new order, nor did I see my server anywhere to even attempt to ask for a new order.  Had the food runner been aware of the two different orders of steak and eggs I would have been much happier with my meal, considering the amount of money I paid for my half eaten meal! Also, once we ordered our steaks, how does a server not bring steak sauce to the table? My friend got up and walked over to a group of servers just standing around and had to ask for steak sauce...a good while AFTER our food was delivered. \n\nWe never had our sodas or coffees refilled by our servers' own free will, we had to ask him!!!! That is Server Responsibility 101!!! CHECK ON YOUR TABLES!!! \"May I get you some more coffee....some more water...some more soda...some more tea, how does everything taste!!!\"  I mean come on! That's was absolutely pathetic!!  \n\n      My third complaint is the negligence on the part of the server when it came time to pay the bill.  We were a table of 10 people, we made it VERY, VERY, VERY easy for him to split the bill up. The three adults took the time to add up our meals, drinks and gratuity, Nevada tax, etc, etc for our server. We wrote the last 4 digits of each credit card and the total amount to be charged to the three separate credit cards.\n \nHOW HARD COULD IT BE?!?! WE LITERTALLY SPELLED IT OUT FOR HIM:     \n  Credit Card # 1234- $85.00\n  Credit Card # 5678- $45.00\n  Credit Card # 9101- $90.00\n\nAND YET HE STILL MANAGED TO MESS THAT UP AND HE CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD TWICE!!!!!!!!!!  \nARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! \n THANK GOD WE CAUGHT HIS MISTAKE, HE DID FIX IT, BUT I WAS TOLD IT COULD TAKE UP TO 3 DAYS FOR THE EXTRA CHARGE TO BE TAKEN OFF MY CARD.\n BUT HOW MUCH EASIER COULD WE HAVE MADE IT FOR OUR SERVER?!?!? IN MY 10 YEARS AS A SERVER I NEVER HAD IT THAT SIMPLE, WHEN IT CAME TO SPLIT PAYMENTS ON ONE LARGE TABLE!!! \n\n\nOther than all that I will say this, the food was good. My daughter ordered the baked apple waffles and they were delicious.  \n\nThank you for taking the time to hear me out.\n\n\n\n\nAlya  C.
