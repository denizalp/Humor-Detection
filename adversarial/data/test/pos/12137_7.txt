The Trunk Space art gallery on Grand Ave. is one of the not-so-hidden gems of the downtown Phoenix art scene. From taking your very first step into the intimate space, you will discover some of the city's best art, along with the home of Arizona's BEST local music. In its three-year existence, the Trunk Space has acted as an art gallery and as a nightly music venue; and has hosted many special events such as film festivals, freak shows, improv comedy, dance lessons, and performance art. It is a small, intimate environment and with super-friendly owners Stephanie Carrico and JRC, your visit to the space is even more personal and special. The Trunk Space is in the heart of the scene, next to the legendary Bikini Lounge and on a growing part of the community where more and more galleries and spaces are beginning to sprout. Veterans to Phoenix's Arts District, the Trunk Space has more to offer than any other venue due to it's regard for community and it's all-ages friendly atmosphere. It is no wonder why the Trunk Space is one of the stops for many touring national and international bands as well as a constant venue for many of the best local musicians in town. The Trunk Space is also home to Arizona's only traditional Black and White photobooth and has an array of hand-made crafts, journals, and other trinkets for sale. To top if off, it's probably the only music venue that not only has an assortment of specialty bottled sodas but also vegan-friendly jerky, and ice cream snacks. Whether young or old, the Trunk Space is one of the best places to do anything and everything in a scene that is definitely on the rise.
