Well I really wanted to like this place. My fiance and I frequent Vegas several times a year and prefer to avoid the crowded, noisy, smoke-filled casino hotels on the strip, preferring to stay at smaller boutique hotels on the outskirts. Normally we like to stay at the Rumor boutique hotel but they are currently closed. Their website suggested a stay at The Artisan as it is one of their sister properties and since we were attending an event near Fremont St. the location seemed perfect. I booked this past Friday and Saturday. When we arrived around 9pm friday night the hotel lobby was empty. We went to the check in desk and there was a sign up stating that they would \"be right back.\" Waited a few minutes giving us time to look around a bit. The idea of the hotel is unique but the execution is a bit of a mess. Its very dark (black walls) and dimly lit by a hodgepodge of light fixtures. There are hundreds of paintings lining the walls and ceilings that look as though they haven't been dusted since they were hung. In general the whole place looked as though a good cleaning was needed. Finally a young lady walked by and saw us standing in the lobby with our luggage and asked if we needed to check in.  She looked up our reservation and handed us key cards to room 525. \n\nWe went up to our room on the 5th floor in the farthest corner on the pool side. My first impression of the room was that it was tiny. I've stayed in bigger motel 6 rooms. No typical hotel amenities. No coffee, no hair dryer, no full length mirror, no conditioner, not even a pen or paper apparently the $33 in \"resort fees\" cover the two bottles of water that come with the room. Thankfully the bathroom was clean and the room was tidy yet very worn. The bad art that lines every wall in the hotel continues into the rooms (the ones in the hallways have puntures, tears and various liquid stains splattered on them) One painting in my room was literally flaking off onto the floor. The plaster shelves above the bed were all chiped and cracked. The furniture was old dingy and waterstained. The carpet was stained everywhere and was lumpy...actually the entire room felt as if it sloped down towards the headboard. The walls have areas where the plaster is showing and very bad patch jobs and stains. Just an extremely poorly maintained hotel. The shower had such bad water pressure that the water just limply trickled from the showerhead. The bathroom toilet was lose as well. There is zero counterspace in the bathroom. Nowhere to set your makeup or hair irons unless you count the toilet as a counter.\n\nHad a drink at the bar...long wait for a bar with two bartenders and 5 people in it. went to check out the patio but there was a cover charge so we left.\n\nWe wanted to take a cab to our next destination since the hotel has valet only parking. We asked the Valet to call a cab. He said they take 45mins to an hour to get here...huh? Apparently since the hotel is at the end of the strip and in a less than desirable neighborhood cabs don't find it worth their time to come there. He said Uber would be our best bet. Yet the Uber driver wanted $40 to take us 3 miles again citing the hotels location as the reason for inflated rates. Needless to say we drove ourselves everywhere that weekend and were obliged to tip the Valet several times a day for them to park our car 20 feet from the door. \n\nReturned hotel around 3am. Music is going but there are very few people around. We get stopped at the elevator by a guy selling 'art' off of a folding table set up next to the elevator doors. Awkward. Ever tried sleeping on a matress that sinks to the floor on the left side and has a huge hump in the center? I figured at 3am there wasn't much to be done so we went to sleep, both of us, squished together on the right side (basically two adults on a twin bed). Turn the lights of but there are no black out curtains! what? This is Vegas...people stay up all night and sleep all day. Black out curtains are a necessity here. they have shutters on the windows that emit light through every slat. Had to hang the towels over the windows. Then at 7:30 am the loudest techno music starts playing from the pool for a couple mins then stops for about 20 mins and starts again over and over until I finally gave up on trying to sleep at 9:30am. The girl at the front desk gave the explanation that there is a pool party from 11am to 7am. soooo basically a DJ plays music by the completely empty pool allllll night (which still didn't explain why the music was blarring from 7:30 to 9:30). Without apology she said maintenance would be up for the bed that was \"off the rails\". Never came. Upon leaving I told Steve at the front desk about these issues to which he unapologetically stated he would mark the room as out of order...geee thanks. so I paid to stay in the broken room. My back still hurts. This place would make a great set for a horror movie.
