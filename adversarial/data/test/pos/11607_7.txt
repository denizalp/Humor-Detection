What, what  a great find! I usually am on top of the new restaurants that are opening in the area, but somehow this one got by me. Wifey spotted it the other day and we decided to check it out yesterday. It just opened on Tuesday, so it was perfect timing. The location is great, it's located right next to Postino on Central. The decor is done awesome, very urban but warm if that makes sense. The restaurant was very busy but seemed to run like a well oiled machine. We were seated pretty quick, they have a nice patio and tons of indoor\/bar dining options. We started with a few cocktails, traditional margarita and I went with the blood orange margarita. Wifey wasn't over the moon about her traditional margarita, was a bit flat but my  blood orange margarita was great. they have a well rounded menu with tacos, tamales, tortas, burritos and a few specials. They also have a short list of apps\/shareable plates. we started with the guacamole, which was done perfect. I opted for 3 tacos: Fried fish, braised beef and this spicy chicken. They were all great, my fave being the  braised beef. I also got the Mexican street corn, which was delicious. Wifey got the Chilaquiles, and LOVED her dish. They even have a kids menu for my daughter, which is always welcome. All in all, great good, superior service and perfect location. I'll for sure be back!
