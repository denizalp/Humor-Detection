It's always a treat to stay at Aria what with their modern and chic rooms to all their amazing dining options.  Jean Phillippe Patisserie is amongst another great reason to stay at Aria!\n\nJPP serves up and sells some of the most decadent treats ever.  From little pastries like cinnamon buns and cake pops to boxes of gourmet and fancy chocolates, what can't you get here?  They have delicious crepes, a wide selection of gelato, sandwiches, salads, et cetera.  After a night of drinking and such, it's always an amazing treat to buy yourself a sweet and devour it in the comfort of your room.\n\nThe lines are ridiculously long here especially on weekends at breakfast.  If you're smart, buy your pastries the day before and hide it in your room because the wait can be pretty ridiculous.  If you got to have their quiche though, brave the wait.  It's worth it!\n\nAlso, don't forget to check out their display\/exhibit at the side of their store.  It's always changing and always huge, detailed, and made from chocolate!  Their Bellagio location features the \"world's largest  chocolate fountain\" as well so hop onto that monorail and head over to Bellagio for a peek.
