The banquet hall looks nice, but the service is poor.  We recently held our son's christening party there, and when we went to visit the hall before the event, it appeared very nice.  However, on the day of the event, the chair covers were filthy.  Seeing as how you have to pay extra for chair covers, this was really aggravating.  The staff were very unresponsive and needed to be babysat.  For example, they didn't replenish the buffet when the food ran out; we had to keep asking them to do so.  Anytime we needed anything, we had to ask repeatedly before they did it.  We also felt cheated on the food.  For example, the palak paneer had barely any paneer in it.  The rasmalai was not the good stuff that they serve at the restaurant, but rather the cheap (and awful) canned variety.  Overall it was not a good experience and I would not use them for another event.
