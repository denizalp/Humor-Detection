I've ate at many vegetarian\/vegan restaurant especially since my bf was vegetarian for 10years. The restaurant was okay.\nWe ordered the nachos and we also ordered the hippie chick burger.\n\nService was so good. Our server was so nice. I wish I remembered her name. \n\nThe food lacks in flavor.\nThe Hippie Chick Burger. I don't know it needed something. A sauce perhaps?? The collard greens that was served with the burger was so bland. I mean I know you want it to be healthy but healthy can have flavor too. There could of been like type of sauce drizzled on top of it like a lemon vinaigrette or something. \nI know this dish could have potential especially since I know they make their condiments by scratch like their ranch. I'm sure they can come up with a recipe.\nThe nachos were delicious but the vegan cheese sauce got cold quick.
