~*~ 550th review ~*~\n\nI needed to get away just before all the holiday madness and when I started getting travel alerts for Vegas, I knew this would be the hotel for me! I was last in Vegas maybe 10yrs ago, and the strip has changed a LOT. The Cosmopolitan is very new (to my eyes) and located centrally. It's about a $20 cab ride from the airport.\n\nThe lobby area is incredible, with these large tv pillars. Everything is black and swanky\/sexy. I had read about the long waits for check in, but since we arrived at 10am, it was just an off-time. We were quickly directed to the next available front desk person, she checked me in and offered an upgrade for about +~$35\/day (which I declined, only because the room was not available NOW, I was tired, you see. Hehe). We happened to be here during a huge rodeo conference, so all the rooms were booked. She gave me my keycards and said they would text me when the room was available (and let me know what room it was when I got the text).\n\nThen we stepped over to the bellhop area, to drop off our luggage and that took a few minutes longer, but it wasn't bad at all. We went straight back out and easily had a cab waved to us to go for brunch.\n\nIt was about an hour later when I received a text that the room was ready. Nice and early! We did some stuff, and a few hours after that, we came back and tried out the room.\n\nTheir smallest room option is a 2 queen bed. It was perfect for two of us. I had considered asking a couple others to join us, but I think 4 would have been a tight fit (and we would have likely upgraded to the terrace room if we had 4). Anyway, we were on the side of the building, so looking out, we immediately saw giant fans(?) and a tennis court below, but if we looked over, there was a nice view of the strip and in particular, the Bellagio fountains. The windows were thick pane so you couldn't really hear anything, this is especially important due to the number of fountain shows the Bellagio hosts. \n\nThe bathroom is weird, the sliding door also served as the door to the closet. So if you close the bathroom door, the closet is open and vice versa. This is only mentioned since I used their in-room safe, and if the safe door was open and the bathroom door comes rolling back, there will be a bit of a jam. Further, the shower had a window looking into the sleeping area, so we just pulled that blind shut the whole time. The toiletries were C.O. Bigelow, which were excellent. Although having the bathroom fixtures be black only made more apparent the water spots, which really cannot be helped. But it did slightly detract from the glamorousness of the room. The shower water pressure was a bit intense. I had scoffed at a shower that was TOO much pressure, but now I understand. The hot water was consistent and they gave us bathrobes to wear!\n\nAnyway, there's a flat screen tv that plays music or tv, and their wifi was available at a good connection speed.\n\nFor a huge hotel it was almost rare to have to share the elevator with another group and wait for one to arrive too. It felt very private for being a large hotel that was at capacity.\n\nThe lower level has all the gambling, a bar, a coffee stand, those types of things. We gambled a couple times..at the Showgirls and Wonder Woman slots, and we used the coffee stand twice daily. The smoke on these floors wasn't too bad.\n\nOn the 2nd floor were the restaurants, of which we ate at the paella one (review shortly). We wandered along much of the public spaces of the Cosmo, they have lots of conference rooms and decorations (giant high heel shoes) for picture-taking.\n\nEach morning we splurged on room service for breakfast. Their pricing was reasonable, the taste was good, and the portions were large. The folks bringing the meals pointed out that the tip was already included in the bill when I wrote in an additional tip, and I appreciated that. Housekeeping did a good job with replenishing our toiletries. \n\nWhen it came time to check out, I used the check out option on the tv which was super easy. It was a bit more challenging to secure a cab to the airport (long lines and no cabs to be seen), the attendant was quick to find people willing to travel together to share a towncar and that went pretty well (towncar for 4 people was $70).\n\nThis was one of the nicer places I have stayed, they made it so easy to do just about anything. I would happily stay here again.
