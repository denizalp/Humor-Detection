I went here about a year ago with Kate M. and we had a marvellous time. Yesterday, it hit me- an intense desire to return. So I brought along my BF and we made a far east movement to Motimahal. \n\nWe ordered two meat thali's and (spoiler alert!) it was way more than I needed, perfect for him. The system is that you order, get a number, wait for the rice, naan, etc. to get prepped, number is called and then you head back up to the front to make some selections. I opted for the butter chicken, saag paneer and a pea-paneer dish. Along comes the rice, naan bread and a little onion and pickled beet salad\n\nMaybe because this time I hadn't trekked in rain, on foot for an hour prior to eating, but I didn't find it as satisfying as last year. The butter chicken has a nice smokiness to it but the cut of chicken, full of bones was a bit distracting. The saag panner was my least favourite, kinda bland. But the favourite was the pea and paneer dish! I also enjoyed the daring onion and beet salad with it's minty dressing. The naan was great and I loved the addition of black sesame seeds sprinkled on top. \n\nIt's a funny, fast-food, Indian place that fills you up! A bit hit and miss, but with enough hits at a low, low price to make me come back.
