After hearing about how bombdizzle Oyster Bar is from numerous friends, I hauled my ass over the first chance that I got. And whooo wheee, it's FANTASTIC. \n\nThe chefs prepare everything to order and better yet, they prepare it in front of you so you can watch the magic happen!! \n\nFor a first timer like me, I went the safe and easy route and ordered a half dozen oysters and the ever popular Combo Pan Roast to share. \n\nOysters - superbly fresh. Comes with all your usual fixings--chunky horseradish, lemons, marinara sauce, and tobasco sauce (upon request). Prepare to your heart's desire and slurp on up!\n\nCombo Pan Roast - wow, this stuff is like crack. Even when my stomach was telling me, \"No more, I'm stuffed!\", my mouth would keep commanding, \"More!\". The best part of the meal isn't the plethora of seafood (a whole lobster tail, 4 halved crab legs, and a shit ton of shrimp) that crowds the dish, the best part is... wait for it......the broth!! The broth consists of a sweet creamy tomato broth mixed with various savory spices and brandy that will leave your tastebuds feeling a bit perplexed (but in a good way!) from the flavor complexity. My friend and I enjoyed this dish much like you would a curry dish rather than a soup, so we ordered an extra side of rice for it. The dish was large enough to overstuff the both of us. \n\nIt's a pricey place overall, but well wort the price imo (and the portions are large so many of the dishes can be split between two people).  And here's the kicker.... all this awesomeness is available 24hrs a day!! So if you're wandering around the strip drunk at 5 am, and you want to get your fancy on.... I suggest you stumble on over to Oyster Bar at the Palace Station for their Pan Roast!
