The wonton noodles here is as good as their 2 other locations.\nThe only issue we've had with this location is that on 2 occasions, they ran out of ho-fan. The second time was on a Saturday afternoon. Come on!\nMy mom didn't approve of how some of the staff was rude but then again rude staff at a Chinese restaurant is nothing new.
