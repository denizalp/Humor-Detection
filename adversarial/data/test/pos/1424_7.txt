The Ultimate Starbucks!\n\nI am just so happy and excited that Toronto finally gets our own Starbucks Reserve! \n\nThis place is so spacious and with different seating options! And here you can get \"coffee\" that you cannot get from your Neighbourhood Starbucks. \n\nBest place to use your Rewards! That Nitro Cold Brew Float ($9) so rich and smooth! Drink like a milkshake. I now know what's my summer dessert drinks will be!\n\nStaff here so friendly and outgoing. They must love working here!
