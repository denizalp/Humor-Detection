Every Saturday I stop at Caracas Empanadas after my farmer's market rounds, and I honestly look forward to it all week. Two words: DAT SAUCE.\n\nI should be upset that they use a flour based shell rather than a corn flour shell. In most of Venezuela, Caracas included, the traditional outer shell of an empanada is made with corn, for a nice thick but crispy outer layer. The owner told me once that he tried to do it that way originally, but the supply of Harina Pan (the cornflour of choice) is expensive and unpredictable. So to be consistent he decided to stick to flour. Bummer. But as much as I want to care about authenticity, I just don't in this case because it's so delicious.\n\nMy personal favorite, the Pabell√≥n, is slightly more expensive than the other filings, but the filling blend is spot on and is totally worth it. But no matter which filling you choose, make sure you get plenty of that amazing green Guasacaca sauce. It's the highlight of my day. No joke. I asked the guy today if I can buy it in bulk. He said yes and that plenty of people do, you just have to ask for it in advance via their Facebook page. Awesome. I've been eating here for years, the sweet lady working there even know my name, yet it had never occurred to me to buy their sauce in quantity for personal use until today. What a fool I have been! \n\nAnyway don't miss these guys. Venezuelan food holds a special place in my heart, and Caracas Empanada warms my soul. They will not disappoint. Just get there early if you visit them on Saturdays, before the lines get long and they sell out of options.
