Awesome first experience at Haberdish. First off, no wait saved our evening. I put us in on a busy Saturday night before ordering the lyft, and ended up with around an hour to do some bar hopping before dinner. Estimate was a bit short, but no problem for us.\n\nDrink menu and selection were rather impressive. I ended up going with a BBL stout and my wife chose a mint julep which featured great flavor and impressive presentation.\n\nRegarding the menu, it is simple and small, but everything on there was intriguing. Yes, the fried chicken is amazing. Biggest surprise for me of the night was the sweet potato dumplings. Awesome flavor and texture. I would also recommend the biscuits and bacon jam - which was closer to biscuits and gravy IMO. I also feel you get a good bang for your buck. We split the meal (The sides are big enough to share) and our food bill was only 30. Glad they aren't overcharging and we were stuffed. We are definitely looking forward to coming back!
