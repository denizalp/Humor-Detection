I'ma go all out an give Ferragamo 5 stars for my two stops here last weekend.\nSaturday, the mall is packed, not at Ferragamo, great service and water bottles to quench your thurst from the pounding desert sun.\nBehold, the maroon with gold heeled boots I tried on in New York a few months ago and left behind not wanting to pay the $1600 price tag.\nLast pair, MY size, $300!!!!!\nTried them on, swoon and put them on hold till later.\nYes, thats how I shop.\nI mean, do I need boots in the summer? Living in the desert?\nYes, yes i do and drove back the next day.\nGreat service again, smiles, \"Youre back!\", tried them on again, swoon, happy as a clam, now they get to sit and look pretty until the temps go down again.
