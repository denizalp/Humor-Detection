I keep coming back! Service is very fast! Server keeps filling up our water. Food was amazing! We ordered the corn twice because it's that good! We also ordered crispy king prawns to share! A bit spicy but very tasty. Highly recommend the salmon with cream sauce over baked udon! Awesome experience overall!
