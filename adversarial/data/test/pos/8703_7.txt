We're all adults, let's be honest here- this is not where one goes when sober. But at the end of a long night out with friends, this hits the spot! \n\nTip #1: Don't use the bathroom, seriously, it will scar you for life. Worst. Bathroom. Ever. I have used it twice in life, once at age 12 then again at age 27. Both times I could have used therapy afterward. \n\nTip #2: Order a small fry if you're by yourself or with 1 other person- there will be much more than you expect, it's like a large McD fry x 6. Get cheese! The cheese is glorious while hot, but doesn't reheat well and gets minus one star because it used to be better 5 years ago.\n\nTip #3: Go tipsy! Otherwise you might look at the hygienic issues surrounding you and get turned off. But for all of its skankiness, I've NEVER known anyone to get sick here. In fact, it's saved me some nights from waking up hung over.\n\nTip #4: Enjoy!!!
