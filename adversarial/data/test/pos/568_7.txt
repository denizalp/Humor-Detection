What an fn joke. Who was the moron who designed this disaster? What could possibly cause someone to think you could see a 40 foot movie screen from 10 feet away. Even the ladies selling the tickets were hesitant to sell the tickets for seats this close to the screen. \n\nSomebody please level this corporate greed, disgustingly stupid Downtown Summerlin and everything in it to the ground.
