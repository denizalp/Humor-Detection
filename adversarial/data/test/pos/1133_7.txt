Bam!  Pay attention to this review...I have a first to share with y'all America. \n\nTonight, I actually ate my salad and...and...finished it, before, I ate the pie...no lie.  I have a pictures below to prove it!!  \n\nHad a hunch this was going to be a good find and, it was. Saw pics of the chef (I assume) stringing up his own fresh mozzarella...so; no brainier there.  \n\nI went with the Carne pie and a goose salad with a small curve ball - throw on some of that fresh mozzarella and, give me that bacon vinegarette (sp?) - which for the record was deeeelishhh!!  \n\nCute little place, easy parking (for scottsdale) and quick quick quick.  Everything was delicious - will be bookmarking this puppy for sure!!!
