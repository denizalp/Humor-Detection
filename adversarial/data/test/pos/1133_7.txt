If I could give less than 1 star I would. This place is ridiculous and why I'll never use anything but a local company from now on. Thru brought the flowers in a box to my fianc√©es work. For her to cut the stems and assemble. Pathetic!  Just 'here's a box of flowers...arrange them yourself!'  Never again will this company get my business. I even wrote them a lengthy letter about how appalling their business model is and no reply. Nothing.\n\nDO                 NOT                   USE                1-800-FLOWERS!!!!!!
