While the service and level of care is excellent. The price of the service is astronomical. Much like other veterinarian clinics, they seem to have forgotten that the field of veterinary is about caring for the animals, not squeezing as much as possible out of the owners.\n\n When i saw my bill, i nearly had a heart attack. The price shock helped me to understand why some people abandon their pets when they get sick. Its a sad hard fact. \n\nI love my little monsters, so i will never abandon them. But the price does hurt.
