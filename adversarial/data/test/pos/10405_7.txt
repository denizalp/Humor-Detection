My wife has now gotten me Wicked Bakery's cupcakes for my last two birthdays...They are wonderful!  I have never had softer or more fluffy cupcakes in my life!  Yes they can be a bit pricey, but the convenience of ordering on line and picking up in person is worth it...\nWe ordered 3 different types and loved all three...We got the peanut butter and chocolate chip, chocolate volcano, and the red velvet...All amazing!\nThis quaint little place churns out some pretty fantastic stuff and I cannot wait for another chance to go there!\nWhat mongrel doesn't like a good cupcake!!!!
