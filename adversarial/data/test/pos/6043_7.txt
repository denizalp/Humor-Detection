Went here Saturday morning with my girlfriends for Galentine's Day brunch. If you're not familiar, Galentine's Day is just for the girls on or around Valentine's Day.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there's a sign on the counter that tells you to seat yourself. We were promptly approached by our waitress and asked what we wanted to drink. Some ordered coffee, some ordered hot tea. I like that the hot drinks were served in clear glass mugs. You can see the cream swirl in with the coffee. \n\nThere are a lot of choices on the menu. I narrowed it down to the Ohio omelet which comes with bacon, cheese, corn, and onions in it and a side of potatoes. It was pretty tasty but was lacking seasoning. The potatoes were especially bland and were cooked with large chunks of jalapeno which were still raw and were spicy! I thought it was green bell pepper so I ate one and was terribly surprised that it was jalapeno. I like jalapeno when it's cooked down and the bitter heat is cooked out. Also, it seemed to take a very long time to receive our meals. They weren't ridiculously busy or anything so I'm not sure why the wait was so long. \n\nAs I was eating, my hot tea was getting low and it also took quite a long time before our waitress came back to see if we needed anything. She did eventually refill our hot teas but by then I was just about done eating. \n\nOverall, it was a decent experience made better because my friends were there. While the food is unique and tasty, the service is slow and leaves much to be desired. I might have to give them another shot in the future because there were some other dishes on the menu that I'd like to try.
