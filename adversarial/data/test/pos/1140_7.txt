I reluctantly give a Yelp review for Rojas Barbershop because I want to keep the place all to myself. Rosie, the owner, is the best! I have been going here for years and she always takes great care of me and gives a perfect cut. The wifey also agrees and you know that means something. The shop is clean, cool, and has a couple of televisions which makes for a great experience. I highly recommend Rojas Barbershop but please do not got and make me have to wait!!!  :)
