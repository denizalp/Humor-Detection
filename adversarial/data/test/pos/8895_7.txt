Diet be dammed, it was hot, I was walking the streets of Port Credit (yes.. again), and I needed to cool my heels (and every other part of my body). As I stopped to rest on a bench I took notice of the people walking past me with glorious scoops of ice cream and fro-yo. \n\nI turned and realized I had taken refuge in the shade provided by Scoops awning. Not one overlook an obvious sign, I ventured in to tempt my fate. Knowing I wanted to cool down, have something delicious AND be healthy I asked what my choices were. \n\nAfter the staff ran me through about 50 different flavours, the informed that if healthy and delicious was my goal, that there made to order fro-yo should do the trick. I agreed and ordered possibly the largest SMALL I've ever seen. Thankfully they had my fave combo of frozen strawberries and banana on hand to make this and I soon walked out $4 paid and $100 happier!\n\nCool off here this summer (and maybe winter), I hear they make a mean Milkshake as well!\n\nEatcrest Out!
