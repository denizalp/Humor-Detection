I wish I could give it zero stars. Not sure why, but this place attracts some of the most undesirable people in NE Ohio. I have seen children getting beaten in public and toddlers running around totally unsupervised. The loud foul language (spoken by caregivers) is a guarantee. A police officer is actually employed at this restaurant. I told my daughter that we would never return to Chuck-E-Cheese.
