Wow my experience here left a bad taste in my mouth. These two women that work here are just terrible people! I came in for a dozen donuts and they got irritated at everything possible and had bitch face at me the whole time. Not to mention their kids were there running around and her screaming past my ear to tell them to stop. After I ordered a dozen, I wanted to review my order and she sighed rudely before proceeding to tell me with attitude and impatience tho nobody else was in the store. Then she bickers to the other woman in front of me as if I weren't there and starts talking shit about me in their language as if I couldn't understand! I didn't tell them I understood them but I did not leave a tip on my cc. They scoff together as if expecting a tip after that incident as I walk out. You bitches get what you deserve.  They get 2 stars because donuts are standard (tho I'd hands down pick Krispy Kreme and bosa over golden judge solely on donut quality) but I'll never come back here because it's not worth it to me to be talked about like that for donuts! I've never been treated so rudely ever in my life! Do not support a business like this please!!!
