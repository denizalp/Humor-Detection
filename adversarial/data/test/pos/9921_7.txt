Mes amis! These are not croissants, how dare you even call them so!? Absolutely not buttery, not crispy, not flaky on the inside, they're anything but a true croissant!\nCafe au lait is also not impressive, plus you have to add milk yourself (American style). Perhaps their breads are good, but I wouldn't know, since their croissants got me running in the opposite direction.
