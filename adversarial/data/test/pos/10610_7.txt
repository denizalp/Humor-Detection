As a woman, I have been severely disrespected by multiple officers. It took 5 officers to finally arrive at one with common sense. One of the officers had the audacity to suggest that I walk 15 minutes out of my way, every time that I park in the lot I pay $30 a month for instead of walking across a 15 ft strip of gravel behind a neighboring building. Yea right! I have had friends mugged at gunpoint down the road from me and I am not going to risk my own safety! Walking alone at night as a woman in this city is scary enough. And besides, the officers are busy ticketing people for going 4 MPH over the limit. There is a police man who stands by the Marc's checkout line and TEXTS. We are essentially paying a man to chat on his phone. How could he catch anyone doing anything? Cleveland Heights Policemen may be educated but are really just glorified meter maids.
