I was really looking forward to a spa day here, especially after reading the rave reviews... but I was left disappointed.  I got a massage, a body scrub and a facial here.  The receptionist was really nice, the place was very clean and had a good atmosphere.  I went into my massage appointment, by the time I got into the room, it was 1:17.  The masseusse did the standard thing where she left the room so I could change.  She didn't come back into the room until 1:24.  It generally doesn't take people that long to get undressed.  The massage itself was actually really good, she did a good job.  But then she ended the massage exactly at 2:15.  I felt really short-changed that she took forever to start and then didn't even give me the full hour.  At 2:30 I went in for a body scrub and facial.  The body scrub was really not very good.  She put the tiniest towel on me, and I'm a fairly short person, it barely covered me.  She used lukewarm water the whole time to wipe the scrub off of me, and the tiny towel didn't provide much coverage, I was freezing the entire time.  The facial was also really not very good.  I felt like the entire time, she just exfoliated my face, there was barely any extractions done, she used a really coarse towel to wipe my face.  My face was just really raw after.  \nAfter that, I went to go and pay.  I had purchased some gift certificates for the spa and none of them worked.  I'm not sure who's fault that was, it could very well have been the place I bought them from and not Leela's fault.  But either way, after a disappointing spa day, I was extra disappointed that the gift cards didn't even end up working.  I would not go back and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
