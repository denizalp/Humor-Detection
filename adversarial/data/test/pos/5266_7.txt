This place saved my life today. After going to Verizon and having them state, 'oh your warranty expired a month ago we can't do anything for you...blah blah blah... but you can buy a new phone for $500+...I wanted to scream while running out of the place. You see, my iphone screen went blank but I knew the phone worked. \n\nSo I took it to iRepairs Wireless. Today is Sunday. The sign on the door says By Appointment Only but I tried my luck and it was open. The woman behind the counter was super friendly and asked what I needed. I explained my situation and she said she'd look at it even though they were closed...it was prolly an easy fix. 8 minutes later my phone is not only fixed...she says not to worry about it. What?! I, of course, gave her a tip and was on my way. \n\nI was about to have a break down before I walked it there and there were only sunshine and rainbows when I left. This has been the second time iRepairs Wireless has saved me a bunch of money. The first time I got my screen fixed in like 10min and it still looks and works beautifully. --- and it wasn't expensive! \n\nThis place is a life saver.
