I believe in some cases that the harder they try, the more harshly you should judge them.  Thus is my approach to reviewing N9NE, which (much like the clientele at the Palms) goes all out to show you how hip it can be and hopes you will overlook some details.  The ambiance was nice, the food was decent but not great and the overall experience was just ok.  2.5 stars and I will break my rounding-up trend for aforementioned reasons.\n\nOur appetizers were the popcorn shrimp and the crab-stuffed mushrooms.  I'd say they were enjoyable, but for the price they should have been much better.\n\nFor my main course, I had the bone-in ribeye (the cut I always order) and a side of lobster mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked as requested, and it's pretty good meat, comparable to Ruth's Chris.  I've certainly had better steaks for the money, but there was nothing wrong with it.  My other friends' steaks were similar in that they were satisfying but not amazing.  The lobster mashed potatoes were a bit of a disappointment, I wish I had gone with a baked potato.\n\nWe skipped dessert because of the quality of the meal and the fact that we started our meal really late.  Props to the (rather gorgeous) hostess who was very friendly and accommodating.  She seated us a good 30 minutes after our reservation time (which was the last time slot at which they would take one), and I think they might have even kept the kitchen open for us.   That's great service.\n\nApparently, you can't bring in outside wine, which sucked for us because one of the guys in our group works at a winery and had some amazing wine with him.  N9NE claims that it's a state law (I have a feeling that's not true, but what do I know).\n\nOne of the things that brought this review down to two stars was at the very end of the meal.  Our server already wasn't that attentive, maybe she was annoyed with the late seating or the fact that we didn't buy a bottle of wine.  But at the end of the meal, after she had run our cards and brought the credit card slips to the table, she told us: \"now sign one copy and leave it for the restaurant.\"  \n\nAre you serious?  Anyone dropping this kind of money on a meal has clearly eaten at a sit-down restaurant before and knows how to pay the fucking bill.  It's possible this is a standard instruction, but based on her tone I am quite sure it's not.  Also, of all the times you could possibly offend your customers, why would you do it as close as possible to when they decide how much to tip?
