This is a pretty decent buffet, as far as buffets go. They just opened, so the place is new and sparkling clean. It gets busy FAST, so make sure you come just before lunch\/dinner, or be prepared to wait a few, even with as many tables as they have.\n\nThe staff is pretty nice, and service is really good. They whisk away your old plates very quickly and courteously check in on you a lot.\n\nThere seem to be a lot of food options, but really only a few items for vegetarians. What they do have is pretty good. The food that I tried was decent and didn't seem to be overly laden with sugar, salt, or MSG. The corn on the cob, however, seemed like it'd either been steamed for about 5 days, or it was really old corn. Ick.\n\nPeople seemed to go nuts over the frog legs and the sushi. I recommend the broccoli dishes and the hot and sour soup. I'm so picky about my soup. This soup, with a ton of pepper added, probably is a 3\/5 in terms of restaurant soup. That's more than 2 points over what I give the usual suspects. The egg rolls were pretty good. My companions said the crab was hit or miss.\n\nI'm not big on buffets, but I hang out with people who are. I would definitely come here again.
