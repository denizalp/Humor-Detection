Disclaimer: This review is written under the pretense that the reader understands the price you pay if you want to party it up on the Las Vegas strip! This venue is for the young adult that indulges in pop culture hop hop\/top 40 mashed up electro house music! Since these guys are also on vacation, they should also understand that drinks will be expensive! With that said...\n\nThe staff at this establishment is AMAZING. I take them over XS or Marquee any day. Encore Beach Club is the outside pool party area and Surrender is the inside. Do you wanna know how awesome place is? Sometime last fall some idiot screwed up the plumbing inspection and destroyed one of the water valves. Water leaked into the venue at 1000 gallons per minute, therefore causing millions of dollars worth of damage. But guess what, my former roommate was sent in and in 13 days the place was fixed and back to normal and open to the public. \n\nWhile the inside is a small lounge, the venue relies on the outside pool area to make up for lack of square footage (by housing an extra 7000 or so people). There is a cool looking snake display mounted on one of the walls that is painted in gold. This place is a local favorite on industry Wednesdays and Thursday night dip and dance parties when summer heats up; the pool opens even at night. The only venues I've ever been to that welcome fashionable dress attire as well as swim attire are Encore Beach Club Thursday dip n dance and XS Sunday nightswim, BOTH at Encore Casino lol.
