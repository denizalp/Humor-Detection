I'll admit that I built up huge anticipation for Bacchanal after reading all the early rave reviews and seeing all the pics from bloggers and yelpers.  I finally got to try it first hand with my recent trip to Vegas.  And I didn't waste any time as it was the first spot I went to after I got off the plane.\n\nBecause I wanted to maximize my time and money into trying most of their \"500 menu items,\"  I invested in a 24 hour Buffet of Buffets pass.  But since Bacchanal is considered to be one of the higher end buffets in the BoB group, you have to pay an upgrade fee of $15 per visit.  You can read about my misunderstanding of that fee from my Buffet of Buffets review here (http:\/\/bit.ly\/VherAz).  \n\nI visited Bacchanal twice for breakfast and dinner so I paid $15 for both visits in addition to the BoB pass.  Still a deal compared to paying $19.99 for Breakfast and $31.99 for Dinner.\n\nHere are some things that I picked up for breakfast:\n\nMini Croque Madame, Shrimp & Grits, Bacchanal Benedict\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/11NCfOc\nMy first round.  Everything you see here was good!\n\nSkirt Steak and Egg\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/UgKPjS\nThis was good!  But by this time I've already had enough eggs.\n\nMini Monte Cristo\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/141GjsL\nVery rich considering it's size.\n\nShanghai Dumplings, Smoked Salmon, and Breakfast Pizza. \nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/UOmpgG\nI really couldn't get enough of those Shanghai Dumplings.  Pass on the pizza, it was meh.\n\nChicken Fried Steak\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/UOm6CI\nThis was yummy!!!  \n\nRed Velvet Pancake\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/V3tQip\nPerfect serving size so you wouldn't feel so bloated after.  The pancake was very moist and was spot on with the red velvet\n\nSugar Free Creme Brulee, Fruit, Cheesecake Lolipop, and regular Creme Brulee\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/Xv8VoK\n\nIn addition, though i didn't get a pic of them where their wide selection of freshly squeezed juices.  My faves were the carrot and melon juices.\n\nHere are a few things I picked up for dinner:\n\nShanghai Dumplings, Kobe Sliders, Kalbi Ribs\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/TedAjm\nMore dumplings.  The Kobe Sliders were good but a little dry.  And the Kalbi Ribs were awesome!\n\nAl Pastor Tacos\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/UOlJI9\nThese came from their taco station.  It was like going to your favorite taco truck except you can order as many tacos as you wanted!\n\nRibeye Steak and Raw Oysters\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/10CehFj\nBest finale entree for my time at Bacchanal.  Meat and oysters!!!\n\nMacarons, Mochi, Panna Cotta, and I can't remember but it was good.  LOL\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/Wcxp9x\nBest set of desserts to finish off my meal.  Mochi!!!  Seriously!!!\n\nDespite the good selection of food that i picked up, I was a little disappointed because since I dined there on a Wednesday, they held back on a lot of their best stuff for the weekend, which is probably the best time to go if you wanted to try the majority of their \"500 food items.\"\n\nFinal verdict:  It's a really good buffet.  Probably one of the better ones on the Strip.  It's on par with the Buffet at the Wynn, not sure if it's better though.  In comparison to Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, while WS has an awesome Dessert selection, I'd say the edge goes to Bacchanal because they have so much more to offer even during midweek.  Because I'm not a buffet person, I'm not sure when I'd come back, but depending on the situation, if I'm nearby and in the mood for buffet, I would definitely consider dropping by.
