After at least 5 visits in as many months, I decided now was the time to write an updated review.  The good news, is that this place is still deserving of a +++ 5 star rating.\n\na.  You have to really enjoy real Japanese food, seafood, and the infusion of subtle flavors in order to really reap the full benefits of this restaurant.  \n\nb. The only other restaurant now that I would say is close to this would be Yonaka over on the west side.\n\nc.  Here is what I have found to be extremely consistent:\n\n- Value - The place is an amazing value for the quality of food and the uniqueness as well!  Previous to Soho and Yonaka, I would get my fill of really unique Japanese from Nobu. I would easily pay 150.00 plus per person and while having a very good meal, I would feel like I did not get any great value.  Here at Yonaka, the value is amazing. From Uni to Hamachi Kama to Hydro Bibb, the prices, value and the quality of food is spectacular!.  You can pay for four people about 150.00 including tip if there is no alcohol or dessert.\n\n- Chef - Chef John Chien is absolutely creative, welcoming and passionate about his craft. He is extremely consistent, very adventurous and is involved in all aspects of his restaurant.  He will wave at you and make you feel at home. Who doesn't love going home.  There is no place like home!\n\n- Food - Everyone has already posted all the different menu items, the choices, menu and etc.  All I can add is that I am always excited to come here.  I am looking forward to ordering the same things, new things and what is on special.  The same things seem to always be unique and better tasting than the last time.  The new things are always such a wonderful delight and the specials are always so darn creative.\n\nd.  Groundhog Day - Do you remember this Bill Murray movie where he lives the same day over and over again?  My favorite quote from this movie is \"I was in the Virgin Islands once. I met a girl. We ate lobster, drank pina coladas. At sunset, we made love like sea otters. That was a pretty good day. Why couldn't I get that day over and over and over.\"  If I had to live a day over, it would be dining at Soho every day.  It just gets better and better.\n\ne. Quick hints - Always busy, off hours are going to be best, but still busy. \n\nGK says, go for it.
