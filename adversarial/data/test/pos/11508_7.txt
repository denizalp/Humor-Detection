The hotel itself gets 5 stars. I have to give them such a low score because of their security management. I was sexually harassed in the elevator my first day. (According to video the guy poked my behind. When I reported it I just said he touched my behind in someway since I wasn't positive what he had done) a security manager took my statement and assured me it would be handled. It wasn't. The tapes were not even reviewed until after my nearly weeklong stay had ended... \n\nOn my second to last night, I was assaulted again in the elevator. I was 100% sober. The report does not say that because it was EDC weekend. I will admit I got in the guys face after he shoulder checked me and I was screaming and red hot angry, but I did not touch him or threaten to. I just made sure he didn't leave, notified cleaning staff who called security. I was extremely shaken up especially because this was the second incident of unwanted physical contact in less then a week! I have an anxiety disorder and nearly had a panic attack so the guard ex courted me to my room to take my medication then asked if I wanted the police called. After saying yes, I was taken to the security interview room. That is when things got ridiculous. I was still incredibly upset and had my friend with me. I was asked for my story several times, when the security manager (same one that \"helped\" me with my first incident) came in. When I said I wanted to press charges he scared and threatened me out of doing so. He said the guy who hit me could and would press charges against me in retaliation and that he would personally kick us out of the hotel as trespassers. When I asked to speak to another manager he denied my request. I felt trapped because I would have nowhere else to stay so I didn't press charges. \n\nWhen I checked out of the hotel I told a manager what happened he was polite and curtesy of course and he said he would pass it on. \n\nIt was passed into risk management.\n\nThe guy dealing with my claim admitted he did not watch the tape from the interview room and refused to do so because reports from that day did not mention the managers threats (surprise, surprise...) and that I was intoxicated. When I responded by saying that it was wrong that he didn't even consider the possibility I was telling the truth bc a report made by people working under the manager said I was drunk and that I changed my mind about pressing charges and it shouldn't matter because he can watch the video and hear the manager threaten me himself. He responded by saying he had watched enough videos and would not watch it. \n\nAs I told him, I hope his (you or your) daughter, mother, or sister is never judged and treated the way I was after being assaulted and then further mistreated by someone who is SUPPOSED to get down to the truth.\n\nI am shocked that a hotel I paid $2000 for and charges more then that usually would tolerate employees speaking to a guest like that and bullying them. Even if I had been drunk he threatened me with eviction if I pressed charges! So wrong.\n\nNeedless to say I am seeing what the Las Vegas police can do about this matter. I may not get anywhere, but I will do whatever I can to see that this doesn't happen to anyone else.
