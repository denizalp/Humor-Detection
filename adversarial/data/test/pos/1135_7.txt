Sensory Overload when you visit this place!  I have told my daughter that she is banned from coming here again, or at least until she can control her behavior!\n\nMy main gripe with this place is the outside of the building- this is a suburb, not Hough, Compton, or Washington Heights -could you please hire a company to paint or power wash your building?  It looks terrible!
