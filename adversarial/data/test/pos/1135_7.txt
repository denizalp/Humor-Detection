The worst service EVER!!!!  The staff working there , will not mention names although did speak with regional manager about incident, are the worst !!! Mean! Horrible service ! Demeaning ! Racist! Anti Semitic behavior ! Nazi behavior! If they see you enter, and God forbid you forget to bring your Louis Vitton purse, and your Chanel shoes etc... You are in for a treat of the \"pretty woman\" experience! The \" you don't belong here look\"! I have been shopping at pottery barn for over a decade , Santa Monica store  and biltmore store! This one at Scottsdale quarter has been the worst ever! Laughing at your face from the sales woman while expressing your concern about being poorly treated is one of the insult amongst other! I've contacted the corporate office abs waiting to hear back. The only person so far who was nice enough to care was the district manager who took the time to talk and listen with care! Although , she offered products for me to keep at no charge for all the inconvenience, I couldn't keep them! I so not need free or charity, although I appreciate the gesture, all I need is for the store staff to be held accountable and responsible for their horrible behavior and action and I will need a serious apology! Until then, will not step a foot there ever Again!!!
