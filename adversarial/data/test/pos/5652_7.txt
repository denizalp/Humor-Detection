Sanctum is memorable but not my cup of tea. I liked the music but it is too loud to have a conversation. The venue was very hypnotic but also impersonal. \n\nThe dance floor is too small to do anything but free-style but that doesn't matter because nobody there seems to know how to dance -- and they don't care anyway. The point of dancing at the Sanctum is to wriggle for hours to the unending techno beat. The interior is dark with flashy strobe lights, which gives anonymity to everyone there. It's great for people who are self conscious because people flash in and out of our universe into different dimensions.\n\nI don't know how people manage to hook up there but I'm sure they find ways to do it. It proves that you don't need conversation to procreate. Sexual pre.ference makes no difference at Sanctum as there are all manner of persuasions that come there. \n\nI enjoyed sitting in the stadium seating to watch two lesbians who put on a stunning duet of free style dancing. Their sexuality felt very liberating.\n\nRestrooms are cool and the gothic art is worth seeing at least once.\n\nI had a drink that was spiked with plenty of alcohol. I have read many reviews saying the drinks were watered down but based on my sample of one they are strong enough to get the job done.\n\nDon't forget to take your ecstacy before you come.
