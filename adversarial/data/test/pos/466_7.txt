*Review solely for delivery service and apps* \n\nBoy oh boy do I love me some Mediterranean food!! This place cured my itch for the next week or so :) \nThe more acquainted I become with Yelp and Grubhub, the better my munching experiences are! \n\nI wasn't too hungry - a friend and I just wanted something delicious to nosch on without having to go anywhere or spend too much money. So, after reading decent reviews, I decided to give this place a shot. \n\nI ordered a salad and a couple apps : dolmas(ALWAYS...as it is my favorite thing to eat in the whole wide world - if made properly), hummus, tabouleh, and the Armenian salad. \n\nThis place has exceeded any expectations I could've ever allowed myself to ever have! \n\nThe food arrived within 35mins - the delivery man was very kind and the food!! Omg the food is still blowing my mind. Exactly what I wanted and my palate is completely satisfied. I swear my stomach even mumbled a \"thank youuuu\" :-)))) \n\nFor the price, the portions are very, very generous! The flavors are all spot on - the ingredients very fresh; you can tell this food was made with love. \n\nI'll be ordering from them again, no doubt!
