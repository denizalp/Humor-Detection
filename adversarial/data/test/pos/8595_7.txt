I was fortunate enough to make it to Shania Twain's final performance of her \"Still The One\" show at the Colosseum.  First off, it was a phenominal show.  Second, the staff at the Colosseum is great.  I've been where they are.  OK, maybe not the physical location but I have been an usher\/greeter for other venues around town.  I know what it takes to make the experience a smooth and memorable one for the guests.  I know that it can be a thankless job at times with obnoxious drunk people giving you a hard time over the little details.  It is difficult to maintain ones composure when they prevent you from doing your job.  The staff at the Colosseum, though, were very professional and hospitable showing people where they needed to be in a rather large venue.  There are many tiers to the Colosseum and several escalators you must take to go from the bottom to the top or anywhere in between.  The staff knew exactly where to send people and knew exactly where each seat was.  They are like old pros.  Kudos to them.  \n\nAs for the venue as a whole, it is beautiful inside.  I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  It is well designed and makes for a more enjoyable experience.  I was thoroughly impressed by the stage.  There is a massive section that can be raised and lowered for set changes.  You get a great view from the top section where I was seated.  I enjoyed he ambience as I waited for the show to begin.  There was a forest scene with little woodland creatures scurrying about.  There were birds chirpping over the PA system.  There are Roman style paintings on either side of the stage.  It is diffucult to get bored in here when in anticipation of a show.\n\nI hope I have a chance to come here again some time.  They get some of the top headliners for some long term residencies so the chances are good that I will want to see another.  I'm already thinking about Reba McIntyre with Brooks and Dunn.  We shall see what else the future holds.
