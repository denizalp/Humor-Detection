I never met Jin. I do not believe I have ever met anyone named Jin. I am not even sure how the name Jin is pronounced (is it gin, like the libation?) \n\nAnyway, I become acquainted with BFG from walking by it from the CSN Las Vegas campus. (Yes, human being are still capable of walking, believe it or not.) This is where the locals go, I had heard, but I was a local and I had never heard of it (or the former owner Jin). \n\nIn any case, they changed their name (unrelated to Jin) and subsequently included desserts to their very basic menu. It just so happened to be a dessert I yearn for on a regular -- unnaturally, regular really -- basis: funnel cake (2.25$). Score!\n\nAnd their chicken is ultimately delectable. I prefer the Baked, then the Grilled, and finally the Fried. BGF. Always get the 6-piece (8.79$, as of this writing). The mac & cheese tastes so delicious, it makes me want to become a fan of mac & cheese (I am not). They have a bunch of sauces as well but I do not mess with anything besides cheddar cheese (is this the only place that has it?) and barbecue, since it is all that is truly needed in life.  \n\nThe service is so friendly, personable, and funny, they make you want to return sooner than you intended. The loyalty programme has teeth too: there is a place for your birthday and anniversary (it could be your Yelpversary if you have no partner!) online and succeeding completion of your first survey, it should be only one more visit to go before receiving your complimentary Four-Strip Meal. How cool is that? \n\nSDCS does not have the same roll of the tongue as BFG (Fuck Bone Grill), but there is room for some SDCC (ComicCon) parodying when it is that time of year (especially with the nerd [comic] store next door). \n\nNeedless to say, I vociferously recommend this business. It is not like there is really much else around anyway, especially if you are walking. Look both ways at the crosswalks. - E
