This is the not place to go if you have just 2 1\/2 hours before your flight (well, in my experience).  I ordered the strawberry gorgonzola with chicken salad and my co-worker got the patty melt with a side salad.  It took approximately 40 minutes to get our food.  There was a table next to us where they asked for to go boxes even before their food came and they were seated before us!  \n\nFinally when our food came, we swallowed everything.  I remember it was good but not good when you're eating in a rush.  \n\nI will probably go there again only if I have 4 hours before my flight.  In translation, NEVER.
