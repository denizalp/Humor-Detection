We were looking for a place to eat on a Friday evening and decided to give this place a go as I discovered it was on my bookmarks!\n\nLocation & Aesthetics - located on W Indian School Road & the corner of W Wigwam Blvd.  The place was almost a little difficult to miss using the GPS as it told me to go further up W Indian School Road and make a U-turn to come back to the restaurant.  I found there wasn't any need to do that as all one had to do is turn into W Wigwam Blvd then turn into the strip mall area with the businesses.  \nThe restaurant is nestled in a corner, of the strip mall, next to Royal Jasmine Thai, and it can be a little difficult to miss because their signage is a bit small (-0.5).\nThe restaurant has lots of seating - indoors and out.  Very clean, with lots of space to walk between tables\/chairs.  They have booths for dining or table and chairs and enough space for large parties\/crowds\/families.  Good lighting and low noise levels.  There was one TV in the corner, tuned to sports and wasn't loud.\n\nMenus - were very simple - one menu with easy to read\/understand dishes, beverages, etc. on either side.  I believe there's also a menu posted on the wall in case you're a walk-in and wish to place an order to go.  \n\nService - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in, asked if we've ever dined at the restaurant before, and asked if we wished for a booth or table\/chair set-up.\nOur waitress showed up immediately after being seated and gave us a warm welcome as well.  Got our drink orders, wasn't pushy to get us to order something, but gave us enough time to decide what we wanted.  \nShe answered any questions we had about menu items, and even made suggestions which was welcomed by some in our party.\nDuring our dining, the owner came by our table, greeted us, and asked how was the food, and made sure we were doing okay.\nTruly a warm feeling!\n\nFood - For me, I had the pick two - pick any two items (fish, chicken, clam, shrimp) and it comes with fries and coleslaw.  \nI picked the fried haddock fish with fried shrimp.  The plate came with 2 large pieces of haddock fish, and 3 large pieces of jumpo shrimp.  \nThe fish was lighted breaded and fried - wasn't very greasy and the fried batter wasn't too thick but seasoned just right.  In fact, it broke apart easily\/flaky, was very crunchy, and the fish was fresh and well seasoned.  The fish was tender and moist too, and not too dry.\nThe shrimp was the same - batter was light but made it very crunchy, and seasoned well enough that I consumed even the tail!  The shrimp was also fresh.\nThe meal came with tartar sauce for the fish and shrimp sauce for the shrimp (2 small containers).  I didn't require more than that, but I'm sure if I did, I would've been provided with more if asked.\nThe coleslaw was fresh, crunchy, well seasoned, and not too sweet and not too tangy, but just in-between which was perfect for me.  \nThe coleslaw is served in a small cup\/lid but I thought it could've been served in a small bowl, like the one you get at restaurants when you order a side of beans with your ribs.  In my opinion, I think the small plastic cup with lid is best for occasions when placing an order to go, and not necessarily for dining in.\nThe fries was good - fresh, hot, but unfortunately on the salty side for me (-0.5).\n\nIf you check in with your Yelp app, there's a $5 off coupon for orders $30 or more.\nAlso, when they bring the bill to you, you will discover, the bill is placed within the book 'One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss.  Be sure to sign it and put any compliments you may have within the book prior to leaving!  It was really great to see, on all the pages, compliments, names, dates, etc. from all the folks who previously dined there!\n\nI like the fact that this is a small, family owned business, and coupled with the great atmosphere, welcoming family staff, and great food, I will definitely recommend to try this place out.  I know, for me, I will be back to either dine in or for takeout.
