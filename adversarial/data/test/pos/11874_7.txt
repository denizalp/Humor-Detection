Surprise, surprise...I think I may like pierogies. I wouldn't call myself a pierogi connoisseur and honestly I've never really enjoyed the pierogies I've had. I always thought, \"What all the fuss about some dough stuffed with a bit of potato - or whatever they are stuffed with?!?!\" Well now I know! \n\nWent to BBT with a fellow Yelper and we got a sampling of the pierogies (the potato and cheese and the sauerkraut, we opted not to get the cottage cheese). I was expecting to have a similar experience of all the other times I've had a pierogi, but to my pleasant surprise this was quite different. \n\nThe potato and cheese pierogies are really stuffed with potato and cheese so it's not like your tasting alot of dough with some potato flavor. The sauerkraut wasn't too krauty if that makes sense - it was alot milder than I thought it was going to be, but this was fine by me. I like sauerkraut but I think the milder flavor suited the pierogi. \n\nThank you BBT for introducing me to pierogies I actually like!
