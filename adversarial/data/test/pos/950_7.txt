Went here for V-day with the wife and both of us were pretty impressed.  I still can't get over the fact that THIS place is at the Four Queens!  \n\nTable side salad was great..we just got everything on it..can't remember the last time I had anchovies in my salad but it was pretty good.  The wife went with the beef wellington and I got the rack of lamb which were both fantastic.  \n\nThey gave us 2 complimentary desserts.  One was a plate of things dipped in chocolate and the other was 2 chocolate coated gelatos shaped into hearts.  Dropped a little over a $100 for everything but I found it to be well worth it.\n\nI was worried after reading so many recent reviews of this place that said Hugo's was going downhill (even from some that had been coming here for years) that this place was going to suck bigtime.  Well...this is pretty damn good if this is downhill.
