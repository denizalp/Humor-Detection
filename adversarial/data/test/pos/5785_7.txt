There is a $6.99 lunch special from 11-3 weekdays that gets you a regular sub and a drink. Not bad since most of the regular priced sandwiches are about $7 anyway. The inside is clean and it's being run by a father-son team. Father was wiping down tables and making sure customers were good the son was slicing meat and cranking out sandwiches. I like the original italian and get it pretty much every time. The sandwich has a good amount of different meats and just tastes good. This place is way better than Subway any day. I get it \"mike's way\" with the addition of mayo. Get a shore points reward card and start earning free food with every purchase.
