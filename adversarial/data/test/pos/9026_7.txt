I signed a lease for a house in Summerlin last week and so far I've been very impressed by their promptness and professionalism. \n\nThe person who showed me the property was helpful and answered all my questions. When I decided to lease the house, someone else sat down with me and went over the lease agreement point by point and explained each in detail. That took about 30 minutes, but it was really helpful to know what I was responsible for and what the terms were. When I had a issue with a policy she changed it without any haggling and we printed a copy to sign. \n\nI took the keys and spent the weekend moving boxes. I noticed a few small things, like the back screen door had been removed and some cosmetic issues. I sent an email and someone called my cell and was at the house to look at the issues point by point that day. He was exceptionally professional and helpful and we set up a time for him to come back to replace the screen. I haven't had any issues working with them, and they are super prompt in returning emails.
