After awhile all these casinos begin to look like each other, especially off Fremont.  For a moment, I thought that the D Las Vegas was Golden Gate with the dancers outside. \n\nI don't gamble much, but friends and family from out of town tend to gravitate to this place. So, I assume that the gaming is good.  As for me, this is just another casino with a bar outside, lovely dancers, and your occasional winnings.  Still a small casino that looks to have been updated in the last year.  However, they forgot to update the carpeting.  \n\nDrink prices are always good, even better when they're free (comped).
