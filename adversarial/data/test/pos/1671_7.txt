Attentive staff made us comfortable in French and English right off the bat as we eased into this soothing cool grey room sunk below street level in Montreal's small Chinatown. We were heading to dinner but hungry already and so ordered dumplings and broccoli to share, which we saw delivered by a gent from the restaurant upstairs. Very tasty. You can obviously get this food cheaper in the area, but it's a great idea to work with a neighbour to provide eating options to balance out the stiff cocktails and keep you hiding out happy here for longer. \n\nThere are some serious cocktails here, and some seriously playful ones, and either way they are hard like one would hope for after a work day or a day spent walking around in Old Montreal. There are also delicious virgin sodas here which is a thoughtful option for DDs or pregnant ladies or friends just off the sauce. The specialty cocktails are huge and fun and the room is chill and quiet lovely. Definitely a nice addition to downtown.
