This is where the actors in plays hang out after shows at the Beck Center. Unfortunately, they forget the play is over. They bring their crazy stage persona to the restaurant and \"act a fool\". The hamburgers, chicken and steak are all good. The fried potato pancake app is a nice change up. This is more of a restaurant than a bar, a good place to grab some food and drink.
