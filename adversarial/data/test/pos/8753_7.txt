Wow I was surprises how crappy this dicks is. I go to dicks sports in Columbus and Illinois all the time and always have a good experience. \n    My buddy and myself went in to measure him up for a bow. I was going in to look at rangefinders. First the bow selection was horrible. Second we were\ntrying to get someone to measure my buddies draw length an we could not get anyone to help us. Lastly, when I did get someone to ask about a range finder, he said \" that one is not good, don't buy it\" and then he walked away. Piss poor customer service!!!!
