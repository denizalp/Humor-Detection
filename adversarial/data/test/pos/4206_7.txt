Situated at the top of the Stratosphere, Level 107 likely boasts one of the best views of the Las Vegas skyline.  After a tiring Friday evening, we retreated to this lounge for a much-needed nightcap. Guests of the Stratoshphere are shuttled to the top where the lounge is located without charge; however, all others must pay a nominal fee before boarding the elevators. \n\nUpon entry, I was immediately stunned and bowled over by the 360 degree panoramic view. Truly breathtaking. The lounge also rotates at a slow pace. How many revolutions per hour is unknown to me, but it was a subtlety that I only picked up on after my astute travel companion pointed it out. The ambience is dark, romantic and casual. I didn't pick up on any overt, pretentious elements, and I was grateful for that, especially considering I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts.\n\nSadly, the lovely views are about all Level 107 has going for it. I was disheartened, to say the least, by the outrageous prices. The majority of the appetizer menu was graced by items that were in the $20+ range. Needless to say, we decided to pass and save our appetites for the following morning. My vodka cranberry was modest in size, was watered down, and set us back around $10.  Seriously, I don't mind paying $10 for a cocktail, but it better be damned good. Unfortunately, this one was just 'meh.'\n\nUndoubtedly, if you are looking to score some extra points with your significant other, Level 107 is probably a spot to have on your short list of romantic dining possibilities. Just be sure to bring a fat wallet.
