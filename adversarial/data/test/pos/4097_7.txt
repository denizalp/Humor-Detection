The last remaining independently owned hotel in Uptown Charlotte. Sad, but true.\n\nWhile it may not be quite as high-falootin' as it was even 10 years ago, this is where I send out of town guests in need of a full service hotel. The rates have gotten somewhat reasonable as of late, which makes it accessible to middle-class peons like myself and my brethren. \n\nOld school is a good description of the whole shebag - although the rooms have been recently updated and are comfily redone. Beds are soft enough but not too much. They have large flat screens for those Law + Order-binge hotel stayers (like myself). The rooms on the upper floors have had their bathrooms completely remodeled - very modern, marble, with those slighty-freaky belly button-level spray things, I no likee but I guess some do. \n\nBut the bar's in the lobby, the bartender's got some weird 6 button vest on, there's a huge ball of floral arranging changed daily in the middle of the retro-greecian-baroque Bowling Alley carpeted entryway, and the staff is slightly stuffy, adding to the whole old-money feel. Plus, for all their staff's scatterbrainedness, the Monticello (and now, the Harvest Moon Grille) is a great place to grab a dinner or brunch. \n\nFree parking even if you're just there to grab a well-made Martini. Awesome.
