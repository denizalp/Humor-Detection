How do they stay open?\n\nLocated in the back of the Sahara Hotel and Casino, one has to wonder when they get business here.\n\nTrying to grab a quick bite before our show on a weekday afternoon, only a handful of parties were present.  \n\nStandard cafe fare like burgers, pizza, salads, etc.  \n\nWe got the Spinach & Artichoke Dip, \"a creamy, cheesy blend of artichoke hearts, spinach, onion, parmesan, a hint of bacon and tortilla chips.  Served in a sourdough bowl.\" for $7.25 and the Nascar Burger, \"a classic Black Angus 10 oz juicy flame-broiled burger.\" for $9.25.\n\nFirst off, the spinach & artichoke dip were tasty, but too small of a portion for the price.  And I wasn't too fond of the soft sourdough bowl - what's up with soft bread?  On the menu, it says, \"place in the center of the table and dive in!\"  Well, it's definitely not big enough to share.\n\nWe asked for the burger to be medium well, but it came out more well done.  There's a problem when you can't even get the burger right.  It had a decent flavor it in though, and it was also on a soft bun too.  The fries had a deep color that reminded me of Arby's curly fries, but without the seasoning.  \n\nService was a bit slow, not on our waitress's part, but on how long it took for the food to come out.  (Were they killing the cow in the back?)  The place needs some better lighting, maybe they are trying to save on the electric bill because I found it to be too dark for my tastes during the day.\n\nOverall, spend your money elsewhere.  When you're hungry on the strip, don't get sucked into bad casino cafes 'cuz you'll feel even more ripped off.\n\n2.5 stars.\n\n(Pics of our lunch posted!)
