The other people are probably affiliated with MobiSquad, as I can't see anyone in their right mind thinking this company is anything but shady!  We were very excited about MobiSquad when we were referred to them and signed up. When they came to set up everything, we learned that they did not have the capabilities we needed for our company. We then cancelled both our gift card service and our monthly service. That was six months ago and they are still charging us!  I have talked with at least a dozen people and no one can ever seem to know who to even talk to. I finally got in touch with the person who has this authority, only to have a plethora of unanswered phone calls and empty promises. We are STILL being charged monthly fees and the amount owed to us is now over $400 and keeps climbing on a monthly basis. The company is pieced together with several different companies taking a piece of the puzzle. I should've listened to the other warnings on the Internet but the salesman had an answer for everything. To say the least, this has been a horrible experience that seems to not have an end in sight!
