Update and bumping down to 1 star.  Here's the yelp compliment sent to me by the employee:\n\n\"Girl, take some midol! They usually work for cramps like you!  I HATE serving people like you,  makes me want to accidentally spill something on you!  You probably squirmed out of a tip!!!!  Go get the midol and eat at home! This place is amazing\"\n\nHard to believe people like this work with the public. The restaurant itself is so pretty inside... too bad the management's attitude is so very, very ugly. Does \"Lulu\" or the owner know about this?
