Five Star Dive Bar :) this place is great. I've been in several times with co-workers but tonight was the best! Tate's Blues Jam! If you're free on a Thursday you have to come in and meet this fantastic man. Fun Fact - the bar has a Tate drinking game that you can play while he's on stage. \n\nTate and his band were setting up for their set tonight and he stopped what he was doing to come to the bar and introduce himself to us. Not only was Tate telling us about his passion for blues and his mission to keep blues alive, he really just came over to invite us to enjoy some of the wonderful food he'd brought in to share with his audience. Let me tell you - Tate makes a mean batch of grilled chicken (SO GOOD) and his girlfriend made a great pound cake with and amazing rhubarb sauce to go with. \n\nYou just don't find places and people like this everyday :)\n\nThe bar staff was great, too! They were running a pretty cool \"suicide king\" game tonight. My buddy won a $10 bar credit FOR LOOSING ha!\n\nIt's dark as hell in there at first but don't be scared! Get off your high horse and go hang out. I'm sure you'll have a story to tell the next day ;)
