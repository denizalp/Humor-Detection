If you're looking for a big delicious bowl of pho, look no further. And when I say big I mean it. Their bowls are huge! And at small price tag. I was definitely a fan of this place. Their broth was perfect. Meat and noodle ratio was spot on. Although I could barely put a dent in my bowl, I savored each and every bite. \n\nMy gfs got the vermicelli and a banh mi and they were all fans. The shrimp in the vermicelli were huge! I couldn't believe it. Despite everything being big in portions, when we ordered an iced coffee my cup was filled completely with ice. There was probably 2 big gulps in there. What a rip! Luckily it was tasty and the hot Vegas weather melted my ice rather quickly so I got a little more out of it. \n\nOnly complaint is that service is a  little slow. But a okay, I know how to behave in an Asian restaurant. It's about hailing them down for yourself!
