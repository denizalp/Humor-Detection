Updated as of 8.21.15.  Thanks for nothing store manager Jaini Jariwala.  I can't tell you just how fun it is to try and do business with someone who doesn't give a darn.\n\nBackstory: Wells Fargo doesn't fully disclose currency exchange rates.  They call it commentary but it's not.   I called corp office 2 weeks ago and they investigated and found that across the board wells doesn't disclose coming back from abroad you ARE charged to exchange currency and it is not commentary.\n\nI was told by corp to ask for the branch manager and explain the situation.   Since every year I have to call to get the money back for the charge I shouldn't receive on my free checking I know the branches have the latitude to make adjustments.  \n\nWhat I asked for was to exchange the currency at rate computer said and to credit my account for the difference between current rate and their exchange rate.\n\nInstead of listening Jaini Gabe me the old \"policy' answer and said she couldn't HRMP.   Really?   Because the office of the President of Wells Fargo says you can,  in fact, their investigation concluded that Wells Fargo branches and wellsfargo.com do not provide full consumer information.\n\nTo add insult to injury, when I tried to make the exchange a court of weeks ago and learned the information I based my decision on was not accurate I asked to have the branch manager call,,, that never happened.\n\nIf you have been the victim of deceptive Wells Fargo practices please make sure to fight your way through all the people in the branch and call centers until you get corp complaints.  You know you have the right spot when they don't blow you off!\n\nShame in Wells Fargo for not fully disclosing the costs of financial transaction and even more shame on @jainijariwala for not being concerned enough to sit down and talk with me about it and try to find a solution.\n \nThe test of a company is not just how few mistakes they make but how they resolve the ones they do make \n\n#jainijariwala completely failed
