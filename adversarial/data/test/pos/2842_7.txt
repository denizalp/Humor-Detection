Here's a little background information on why I went here. \n\nAfter taking my car for an oil change to a local shop near by my house. The mechanic found that the motor oil underneath the oil pan was seeping. I was worried because this car was a pre-owned 2012 with relatively moderate mileage approx. 40,000 miles. Instead of fixing the problem at the local shop. I contacted Courtesy Imports and asked them if I still have warranty on my car. Finding out that my car has a 5 year 60,000 power train warranty, I placed an appointment for the following week. \n\nExperience:\n\nI got there first thing in the morning. Ed was wonderful he took care of me and listened to my side of the story. I got there at 7:00 am and  around 8:30 am Ed came back and told me that they had to reseal the oil pan. He told me it should take about a couple of hours (I really thought that I will stay the whole entire day at the dealership) but I was out before 10:30 am plenty of enough time to enjoy my day. They didn't hustle you for anything extra and they even gave my car another oil change. In the end,  I didn't pay a dime and I will definitely come back here. \n\nExplanation on the rating:\n\n1. The service was excellent from beginning to end. Ed stopped by about 2 or 3 times in the lobby telling me what they were doing. I feel that this makes a big difference it keeps the customer satisfied because they know that their car is being worked on.\n\n2. No up-selling, no BS, no hustling, and no monkey business regarding policy terms regarding the manufacturer's warranty. Out the door I didn't pay a dime, very satisfied.\n\n3. Professional setting, everyone was professional. I talked to another guy and he was very professional (please and thank you pays big dividends with me)\n\n4. Waiting time less than 3.5 hours not bad. I understand that troubleshooting takes time and it is better to be right on the first the troubleshooting in the first go around.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAsk for Ed and I will come back here for my next maintenance.
