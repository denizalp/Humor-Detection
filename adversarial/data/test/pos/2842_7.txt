I hate this store. I never thought that I could say this about a Target. \n\nEverytime I have been here, the police are Here. So frequent, that by the handicapped parking is specific parking for law enforcement only.\n\nThe store is really picked over, with no star bucks, petite baskets, and a lot of un happy looking employees.\n\nSomething about this store just feels dirty to me..and the feeling carries on to the parking lot. Baskets everywhere, trash, it really needs some TLC.
