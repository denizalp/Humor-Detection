It's a fantastic little restaurant like Djerba la Douce that reminds me of how awesome Toronto is and how lucky I am to be living here.\n\nI have never tried Tunisian food nor North African fusion with Southern Italian and French.  Now, I'm a huge fan of this place!\n\nWhat I love about the food here is the flavors.  Each dish was prepared with such a care and love, which you could see through the open kitchen. \n\nI'm a sucker for good calamari and prefer mine without bread crumbs.  The Calamari Djerbieno, imagine tender calamari in spicy tomato sauce with a hint of garlic, onion and other spices.  Love, love the sauce!  \n\nAnother amazing dish was Brique.  This pastry goodness was filled with delicious potatoes, herbs, tuna and eggs.  Good thing there were four pieces, otherwise there would have been some hair pulling over this.\n\nChicken Merguese Couscous was divine!  Tender whole chicken thigh, fluffy and flavorful couscous and tender vegetables, all prepared in aromatic spices.  So good!\n\nOne of my absolute favorites was the trout.  It was superbly done!  The trout was tender and perfectly cooked.  The creamy sauce was peppery.  Save your bread for the sauce.  In my opinion, the trout was as good as the one I had at Ruby Watchco the night before.\n\nThis is a family style restaurant.  Everything is made to order and takes time to prepare.  But it is worth the wait.  Toward the end of our night, the chef and owner even came by and asked if everything was wonderful to our liking.  Well, my rating says it all.
