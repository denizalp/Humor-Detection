We returned to Ruby Tuesday with another couple, and despite trying different entrees, everything was tasty again, and service was exemplary.  Complimentary Cheddar Garlic Biscuits would have been well worth paying for, and Shrimp Fondue and juicy and plump fried Asian Dumplings made great appetizers.  The cheesy fondue came with an unlimited amount of warm and thin tortilla chips, many of which were larger than normal tortilla strips.  \n\nI next stuffed my face with a massive salad covered by Bleu Cheese Dressing that I constructed from the fine, many ingredient Salad Bar that is featured here.  Yet I still had room afterward to enjoy Chicken Mushroom with Alfredo Sauce and Pea, which was really good and creamy.  Peach Lemonade was used to wash everything down.  I was then pleasantly surprised by tiny pieces of peach shooting up my straw to reach the mouth and enhance the drink with bursts of fresh fruit flavor.\n\nOther members of my party enjoyed Parmesan Grilled Shrimp with Penne, and Sirloin Steak & Shrimp with a Baked Potato loaded with butter, sour cream, and chives.   After consuming all of this food, ordering dessert would have been counterproductive.  So, this time we refrained.  \n\nThis consistently reliable establishment will remain one of my staple choices for comfort food.  But  on a Friday night we had to wait about ten minutes to score a table, so next time I will call in advance to make a dinner reservation, which I was told are accepted here.
