People watching that's better than the airport....I promise.  2 1\/2 stars.  The 1\/2 is for the non-smoking section, which was greatly appreciated.  Drinks at the bar were $5, not bad.  Live jazz as well.  All parking is free now.  It looks so much bigger on the outside than it is on the inside.  Must be for all the parking.\nDidn't get to scream \"Winner, winner, chicken dinner\" as I did my share supporting the Pittsburgh economy.  Damn slots.
