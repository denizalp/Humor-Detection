Servers are rude and alcoholics. My server was drunk and could barely form words. Would constantly forget our orders. Insulted us and was rude to us. He cursed us for not taking shots with him. And when I refused to hug him he followed me out the bar asking me what he did wrong. For a moment I considered calling the police to get him off my back. He was way too drunk and was saying racial slurs. Not a place you should ever go to or even consider.
