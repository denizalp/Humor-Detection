Wow...the absolute worst people in Las Vegas have been hired by this location, apparently.  I went into the actual convenience store, this evening, with the sole intention of getting a frozen drink, whatever they call their version of a Slurpee. \n\nI grabbed a plastic cup, attempted to fill it and when I realized that it was all liquidy slush, I threw the barely even filled cup in the trash and left.  As we're backing out to leave our parking space, my friend rolls down the window on my side and one of the men from behind the counter yells...\"did you two take a plastic cup?  Those ain't free!\"  Are you kidding me?  You actually left the area behind your counter (which had a line when I walked out) to inquire about a plastic cup?  Is the SHRINK in your store really that high?\n\nSince the cost of a lost plastic cup is more important than future business, I'll do this location the favor of going to the three other gas station\/convenience stores in the area.
