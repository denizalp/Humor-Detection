If there's something not to like about The Yard, I don't know what it is.\n\nOh, yeah. My bad. I do know what it is. It's the parking sitch.\n\nPainful waits to park or exit when it's busy, and there's now a sign which alerts you that you will be towed if you park on a neighborhood street. \n\nOther than that parking deal, it's a great spot to chill. Hard to imagine a better looking patio with more comfortable options to place your rump and daydrink. The service doesn't hover but they're around when you need a refill or to re-up. Prices are not horrible and you can order great snacks from Culinary Dropout across the floor. The bathroom is begging you to walk in on someone of the opposite sex, but use it as a conversation starter if there's a lull in the action.\n\nIt has been said that the staff here range from dirty-hot to nerdy-hot. They do, which makes them hot either way. I will look at an attractive woman like a hungry lion unless someone smacks me and tells me to stop and the lady friend in my group did the same to the menfolk working here. What a perv, man.\n\nThe crowd was pretty mixed every time I've dropped in. A few older folks, some teenagers, hot moms with strollers and a couple douchebags thrown in. I prefer a bowl of m&ms to a bowl of just rice or beans though, don't you?
