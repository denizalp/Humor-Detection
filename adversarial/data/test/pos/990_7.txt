OMG! I called the main number to make an appointment to bring my car in for a screw in the tire. Instead of just showing up and saying \"here, deal with it\". Normally, for tires my tire swap I bring the car in to a tire shop in the west end but with the weather being cold I didn't want to chance getting a flat on the Gardner and the other option is Canadian Tire which I'm not most confident in. \n\nThe person who answered the phone, I'll call him \"Ted\" (not his real name) instead of putting me through to the service department he decides to deal with my issue. First date I get is December 23, 2013, then December 20, 2013. I tell him that's not acceptable, it's a tire not an engine overhaul and I'm bringing the car in the next day and request that he put me through to a service advisor that has knowledge of cars. He refuses instead he continues trying to be \"helpful\" which just infuriates me to the point of no return. Finally, I speak to a service advisor and I'm given the impression that the December 23 and December 20th dates were unreasonable and that it would have been acceptable to just bring the car in. But, here's the thing if you just bring the car in it gets seen when it gets seen, so the car can be in the shop for a day or days. \n\nSince leasing the vehicles in 2011, it's been one thing after another thing with this dealership, i.e., they install the wrong part, or softwear issue, etc. When the leases are over the cars are being returned and I will never lease another BMW vehicle, nor will I recommend this dealership for it's service or for purchasing a vehicle.
