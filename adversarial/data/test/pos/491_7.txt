Well, of course it's 5 stars. How many other Phoenix Police Museums are there? This is it, and it's as good as it gets.\n\nReally, it's worth a visit if you can fit one into their 9-3 M-F schedule. Free admission, and if you have kids they'll get to wear real Phoenix PD shirts and play in a retired patrol car and on a meter-maid's 3-wheeler. There are dioramas showing the evolution of the department from the horse-and-buggy days to modern times of bomb-squad robots and body armor. It's rather small but nicely arranged, and part of one exhibit pays tribute to Phoenix as the birthplace of the Miranda rights read to each suspect  nationwide for the last 45 years as they are being wrestled into the back seat of a cruiser: \"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say . . . \"\n\nInteresting gift shop area as well.
