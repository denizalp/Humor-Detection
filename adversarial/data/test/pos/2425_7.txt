Have been there many days since they opened. Most of the employees are very nice and eager to make your shopping experience enjoyable. But Wednesday afternoon  I stopped in to shop and get a 25 cent coffee. Two of the three carafes of coffee were empty. The lone barista behind the counter was too busy giving her friend free samples of juices and discussing the merits of each. By this time there were five people waiting. I finally asked about the coffee, and she said in a minute and proceeded to talk to her friend. So rude! If this is her attitude week one, I can only imagine what it will be in a month. Store is beautiful, bakery is great, and I am sure I will enjoy it in the future. I just will not go for coffee when that barista is working. She needs an attitude adjustment.
