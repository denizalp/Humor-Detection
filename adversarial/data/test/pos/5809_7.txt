Hey EDCers, this is the spot you want to go to if you want to continue being engulfed in a luminous atmosphere. I just adore the black light decor.\n\nAnd the food is gigantic! Just like multiple media sources said. \n\nTBH though, I don't even remember the taste of the food, so I'm guessing it wasn't good enough to stick in my memory? I was completely sober, and this was about 8 am in the morning. But I will definitely go back and give it another chance in the future.
