I'm putting this right on the table:  I don't find anything appealing about mexican food, I don't like the way it looks, smells or tastes.  I don't like tacos, burritos, shredded meat, sour cream (unless it's on pancakes or waffles), salsa, or avacados.  (I went to Arriba's one time and had a garden salad.)\n\nEVERYONE where I work swears by this place so I went there once, and only once.  A long time ago I read an article that said the quality of the food at a restaurant is comparable to the cleanliness and condition of the restrooms.  If this is true, and it seems like there's a logical correlation there, the food must be downright awful.  The bathroom floor was filthy, there was no lock on the door of the stall I was in.  No toilet paper in the stall.   No hot water coming out of the faucet, only cold. I vaguely remember the bathroom door not closing properly.   I'll never go here again and certainly never eat anything from this place.  How this place passes inspection is beyond me.
