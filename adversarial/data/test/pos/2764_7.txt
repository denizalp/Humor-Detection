Very big and amazing venue! Saw Mariah Carey here during her xmas special. It took forever for us to decide where we wanted to sit in terms of best price for the seat. We got 1st mezzanine row A seats 711 & 712 for an amazing price. It was more toward the very left side, but we still were able to see Mariah clearly. I highly suggest 1st mezzanine if you want to save $ but still get a good view. The only downfall sitting to one side rather than the middle is that the lights were sometimes pointed right in our face which caused a big glare and blinded us. Row A was really nice and gave us a lot of leg room. Seats were comfortable and there are a good amount of restrooms at the Colosseum. We were a little early, but there was still a crowd and their staff handled it well directing everyone to the right seats. \n\nMariah's Christmas Special was really cute and she even mixed it up by singing some of her signature #1 hits like We belong together, hero, etc. This was nice because it can get kind of boring hearing just all christmas songs. The only downfall was that she was about 15 minutes late to start the show!
