After coming out of LAX and taking a well needed break. Nadia and I decided to check out Cathouse.  Its a cute little bar\/ club.  We walked upstairs and the music was so much better there than LAX.  Kinda sad but the crowd was not the same as LAX.  Nadia and I had got into some good dancing and then decided to met up with the rest of the group.  Overall its not bad place to go party and people watch.
