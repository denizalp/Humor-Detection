I was excited to see a 24hr drive thru open up on my way home. What a complete disappointment. Two thumbs down all day!\n\nI did the drive thru and ordered a beef taco plate, carne asada nachos, and chicken quesadilla. When I got home I was so excited to put this shizzy down, UNTIL I opened up my containers and saw nothing but pure nastiness. The chicken quesadilla was SOAKED in oil, the beef taco was mostly lettuce and cheese, and the carne asada nachos was straight up GROSS! I definitely would have been better off going to Del Taco. And people let me remind you, I LOVE to eat and I'll eat just about anything, but not this crap! I REFUSE to spend and hour at the gym for this place.
