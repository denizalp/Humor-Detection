OMG this place was to die for. I heard about it from one of my bffs and had to see way the big deal was. First off the wait is long but once u get in u understand why. Food was 5 stars get the red velvet pancakes and chili omelet. Service was 10 stars. My waiter was fine as u know wat. He kept me happy his smile could make anyone's day. His name is Jacob so all u single ladies need to ask for him. Anyways the whole experience was great. U wont be disappointed
