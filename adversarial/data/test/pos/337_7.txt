Magazines have a way of piling up month after month, and I get a lot of them every week. No, I'm not a hoarder. I can't stand clutter, so I get rid of them as soon I get them. \n\nWhere do I get them? Well I travel for a living and people leave them on the aircraft all the time. Instead of having them discarded, I collect them and recycle them. \n\nI also use my credit card mileage points and coke reward points to get free magazines. I do not even drink soda, but I get the bottle caps codes from the flights. Why waste them? I do not even read most of the  magazines, and I have taken some that are still in their plastic packaging. That way they can resell them. Why? I trade them out to get my favorite books and electronics. \n\n\n\nOne way to keep them from piling up is to take them to Bookman's. \n\nI love this store, and most of the employees I have encountered have been pretty congenial. \n\nI've only had a few setbacks in the past, but they have since been resolved. \n\nI'm so glad the manager took notice because I'm a loyal customer, and I keep coming back. \n\nOne thing I've learned about successful trading is to bring only brand new and current issues, so I try to take my magazines as soon as I get them. Do not bring anything that has a tear or pen marks and try to bring a lot, so it would be worth your time. I try to come here only when I have a lot of magazines because I do not like to waste gas. I am trying to reduce my carbon foot print, so I take this into consideration. \n\n\nI found a Todd Oldham craft book that I had been wanting, so I was super excited about that. \n\nI love their arts and craft section, so I can get ideas on recycling and refurbishing. I do a lot of DeCoumpage projects, and I have even made a basket using art magazines similar to the one that Urban Outfitters used to sell. \n\nHowever, my favorite part of the store is the electronic section. I've gotten cool stuff here including a Kindle, Hard Drives and Ipod Speakers. \n\nI've been trying my best to reduce my carbon footprint, so I am trying to green my lifestyle. Recycling is one of the best way to do it.
