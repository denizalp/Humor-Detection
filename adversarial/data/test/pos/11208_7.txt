Well well well.  You sneaky, non-descript, awesome little bastard of a restaurant.  Flipped two U-E's before I found you, hiding in plain sight.  Damn it Lux... damn it. \n\nI suppose I'm easy, but I am freakin' smitten with Lux; beautiful, interesting restaurant with tables full of pastries and derishous foodz pumping outta their neat little kitchen that's in plain sight.   \n\nHipster-ish? God damn right, but I'm the furthest thing from hipster and I felt no less love while I was there.  Seems fat white doodz with their bohemian children in tow (bohemian = I let my kid get dressed in the dark) are just as welcome.\n\nIt's nice to be pleasantly surprised by an eatery;  Lot-o-hype seems to be circulating about Lux - possibly because a bunch of  ass-hats were overly pumped about a new 'hip eatery' (entrance is dependent on either a  handle-bar mustache or a 1\/4 sleeve tattoo).  Not the case; this place is le-jit. \n\nWhat did I eat? Biscuits and gravy.  Biscuits and mother-freaking, delicioso GRAVY.  Damn, it was fine.  Not the healthiest thing in the world, but my arteries can go fuck themselves.  Unfortunately, with my dish of choice being so filling, I was unable to perform my duties as 'daddy-disposal' - My child's unfinished portion of dutch pancakes, with fresh berries and what I'm assuming was homemade whipped cream was left for the hungry, more than likely neck tattoo'd kitchen staff.  Vultures. \n\nCan't wait to get at Lux again.  Mmmmmm.
