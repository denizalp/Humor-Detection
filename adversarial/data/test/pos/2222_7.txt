I'll start by saying I frown on animal abuse, but I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't glad someone killed all those chickens and let Roasting Company cook 'em up for me. This is the best restaurant under $20 in the city. I want an iv of Tico Sauce hooked up to me. Will it kill me? Probably. Don't care though. \n\nOverall: A+
