Ok. so in theory, this should be a good burger.  Similar in style to other freestyle patty establishments and marketing the calories, I figured it would at least have some flavor.  I ordered the smallest 1\/3 lb burger.  They have 1\/2 lb, 1 lb and a king size burger as well.\n\nThe product I got caused memories of old sitcom sketches where they squeeze the patty in their armpits.  (PLEASE NOTE, THE RESTAURANT AND EMPLOYEES APPEARED VERY CLEAN AND I AM NOT IMPLYING ANY HEALTH HAZARDS)\n\nSimply put, the oddly shaped, grey patty was unappetizing. Inside, not a shred of pink was to be found.\n\nThe 1 lb burger was simply 2 patties so looked just as unappetizing.\n\nThey upcharge you on everything so the three of us paid nearly $40.00 for two adult burger combos and a kids meal.\n\nThe buns were boring and soggy.\n\nThe burger tasted ok but lacked any special flavor.  In fact, the tomatoes, pickles, onions, mustard and other toppings completely drowned out any possible flavor from the meat instead of enhancing it.\n\nThe fat fries were very good and you salt them yourself so that saved it from a 1 star review.
