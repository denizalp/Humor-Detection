Right now, everyone has a favorite burger place.  Pittsburgh is in the middle of having a burger war in every neighborhood.  However, I still find the burgers and fries at Winghart's as wonderful as can be and tastier than most of the other \"burger' places.\n\nWhen I need a burger fix and nothing else will satisfy me, I head to Winghart's for their Market Square Burger.  Bacon, mushrooms, gruyere cheese and honey mustard sauce on a freshly ground, high quality beef patty!  Are you kidding me?  I would drop kick someone if they got in the way of me and that burger!  My co-worker always gets the Shipwreck Burger and we constantly argue over which one tastes the best.\n\nAdd some \"seasoned\" fries with a side of homemade ranch dressing as a dipping sauce for your fries and you can easily slip into foodgasm territory.\n\nLawd a mercy, I might have to go ther today for lunch!
