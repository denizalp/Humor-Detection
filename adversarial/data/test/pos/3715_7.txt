This place makes me want to drink the hooch 24\/7!\n\nWhen I first moved to NC, I was taken aback by the whole ABC Store thing going on. In AZ I could go to the grocery store, grab some tomatoes, US Weekly and vodka and be on merry way. But when I moved here I quickly learned that was a no-go. So maybe once a year, I hit up the ABC store for my adult beverage needs. Maybe it's because I don't drink as much as the hard stuff as I used to or that I feel like an alcoholic walking into one? I can confidently say I am usually one of the only people walking out of there with one bottle of booze. People stock up and you would think they are shopping at Trader Joe's instead of the ABC store. But God bless because they are using reusable bags!\n\nAnywho, this is like the classiest ABC store I've ever seen with well lit rows of alcohol that would even make a Mormon smile. Add some white walls to the well lit store and it reminds me of the 80's. That plus the fact that they always card me makes me like feeling like an alcoholic!
