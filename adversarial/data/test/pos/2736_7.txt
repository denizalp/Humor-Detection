Ok, look.\n\nI spent the better part of my 20's and early 30's not drinking coffee so I can't consider myself a life-long coffee snob.\n\nBut I learn fast.\n\nAnd after learning that Starbucks is not the end-all, be-all when it comes to coffee - I can almost say that I am no longer a complete rookie when it comes to great coffee.\n\nAnd in my opinion, Echo Coffee is great coffee.\n\nTop off the great coffee with free wifi and a top-of-the line interior fit and finish of the building and this can probably be declared the best-little-coffee-shop in this part of town.\n\nIt just opened today and I got an iced coffee, straight. No sweetener, no additives - just the straight dope.\n\nAnd yes, it was fantastic.\n\nBut I have to admit - I have a big problem with this place and it is one that I will be wrestling with for some time...\n\nIt is a little too far from my house to go every day.\n\nWhich begs the question: is this place good enough to cause someone to sell their house and move just to be close enough to go to it every day?\n\nI will if you will.
