Nope. I'm pretty sure I will never eat at another Red Robin again. \nWoke up Sunday morning hungover as a mo'fo. Actually, I was probably still drunk. But I wanted food and i wanted football. \nRed Robin was suggested. \nWe sat in the bar where they had several tv's, even tho my game wasn't being televised. Damnit. It happens tho. \nI immediately ordered a bloody mary. It was mediocre. Nothing to brag about. \nI couldn't decide what to order. I opted for a chicken sammich. The California Chicken or something? Add jalapenos. \nFriend ordered some type of bbq burger. \nMine came out and had huge slices of raw jalapeños on it. I don't even mind the fact that the jalapeños were raw, bring the heat! But they were sliced SO thick it just makes them NOT good. The chicken was nearly inedible as well. It tasted super fake and just gross. \nFriend initially said the burger was good, but half way thru came to realize that it actually WASN'T. \nNeedless to say I was not at all satisfied with our food choices that morning and will not be returning.
