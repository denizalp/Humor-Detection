This place is a sugary dairy lover's dream.  Unfortunately, if you DON'T eat dairy and want a treat, you have few options, and only 1 in the ice cream department.  Only their Raspberry sorbet is dairy free.  They do a Raspberry \/ Sprite shake that's pretty good, but at $4.95, it's not that great.  I would MUCH rather stroll down Scottsdale Rd. to Green for one of their famous Soynami's... If I ate dairy, this place would be a 5-star spot easy..... I could see myself literally overdosing on sweet here.  Old school vibe, old school treats.
