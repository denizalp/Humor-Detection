This is NOT a fancy place. No dress code from what I've seen - I usually wear converse and jeans (easier to bust a move when I'm comfy). \n\nIf you're a fan of 'older women' (coug... Well you know what I mean) THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE! \n\nFriday night - no cover for girls. Patio is very spacious - I'm not sure if it's heated in the winter, but looks like it, otherwise what a tremendous waste of prime downtown space! Drink aren't very cheap - a bottle of Canadian is $7 bucks. \n\nFun place - you get to dance on stage and mingle with easy going people, while wearing comfortable clothes! Could you ask for more??
