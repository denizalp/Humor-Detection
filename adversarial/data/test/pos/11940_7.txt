I recently visited here for dinner; we were in a large party of nine. And we all had wonderful meals. Reading the earlier reviews of this place, I can only surmise that this restaurant got its act together in the past few years since it opened. \n\nIt was a warm evening when we dined here, and we all loved the industrial d√©cor of this place and how the large, wide garage door \"windows\" were all wide open, exposing this second floor restaurant to the throbbing sounds and sights of bustling Griffentown (with a great view of the Montreal skyline lit up, too). The whole place had a vibrant, hip feel to it. The bar area adjacent to the dining room was hopping, too. \n\nOur long table (to accommodate 10 people) abutted a wall\/divider of wine bottles. I can assume that they offer an extensive wine list.\n\nThe food was great! I don't recall all the meals we all chose. Two in our party ordered a few appetizers. One was the \"bacon lollipops\" which were presented beautifully and, I'm told, delicious. Most ordered different pizzas which are the specialty here. All came plated on thick wood planks with scissors to cut them. Some may think this kitschy but we all thought it fun and whimsical. And everyone loved their pizzas! One was a carnivore, one was the pizza equivalent of a Big Mac (yes, there were a few teenagers in our group! LOL). One person had a seafood pasta dish, which she enjoyed immensely. I had the Caprese salad equivalent: buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes. It was quite good. Without exception, we all had left-overs to bring home; the portions were very generous. \n\nOne dessert was ordered and enjoyed but I don't recall what it was (perhaps a cheesecake? I recall that it looked good and fresh but not unique in any way). I had an earl grey tea with honey which, though not special, was still perfect for me. \n\nMy only qualm about this place was the super loud, throbbing, thumping \"music\" which made it a little hard for us to hear each other. But I admit I am old. Perhaps if I were younger, this pulsating sound which jarred my guts with every beat would be enjoyable. Who knows. Otherwise, this was a thoroughly enjoyable meal in a really cool place!
