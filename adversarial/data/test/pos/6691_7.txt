\"I'm a carb queen. I'll always order macaroni and cheese, but I don't want it to be fancy. I want it to be as close to Kraft Services as it can possibly get!\" â€• Drew Barrymore\n\nOh, Drew.  You're so relatable.  Anyways, we stopped in on a late Thursday night after spin class across the street.  We originally were gonna pop in to the bruschetta and wine place next door but we wanted to give Liberty Market a try.\n\nWe had ordered the Rustic Mac N Cheese ($10.50) and the Thursday Pasta Special of Crab Chile Rellenos ($18).  Carbs are love, amirite?  The mac & cheese is crazy good.  It's so cheesy and buttery.  Upon first bite, you know you're eating a super decadent take on mac & cheese.  I loved the breadcrumbs on top as well.  The whole dish came hot and steamy like an x-rated movie.  As for the Crab Rellenos, whoa!  Crab flavor kicks you in the mouthpants!  The risotto wasn't quite creamy enough but still had great flavor.  The citrus helps cut through the rich Chile Rellenos sauce.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we enjoyed the food but it was a bit underwhelming for the price.  The portions were also a bit on the \"children's portion\" size which made post-workout me sad.  Order at the register and then find a seat.
