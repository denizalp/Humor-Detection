Nora's Nora's let's see... I was thoroughly irritated with my first visit here because of a combination of things. For starters I was invited here on a date and reservations were for 7:15 PM. We weren't seated until about 7:45PM. I was on the verge of just saying you know what this isn't cool and walking out. Of course as soon as this almost happened we were called to our table. What is the point of a reservation if you can't be seated on time or at least within a reasonable grace period after that? The two hostesses working seemed overwhelmed and clueless. Oh but I wasn't alone in the not being seated for a reservation fiasco! There had to be about 3 other parties that were also waiting to be seated and inquiring frequently since we all couldn't pile up in the doorway.. Who would've known that this place would be jumping like this on a Thursday night? Anyways...\n\nWe were seated and immediately greeted. The server was cool nothing much to say about him he did his job. Usually when you ask somebody if it's there first time and they respond yes you start off with some possible suggestions..  Whatev...I guess that's not apart of the job description though. Moving on to the food. \n\nAppetizers:\n\nHouse Salad (Romaine Lettuce, Mozzarella, Olives, Onions, Tomatoes, Pepperoncini,\nHomemade Italian Dressing)\n\nMozzarella Caprese Salad (Tomatoes, Basil, Rosemary-Garlic EVOO)\n\nEntree's:\n\nCrazy Alfredo (Fettucini, Chicken, Sausage, Shrimp, Porcini Mushrooms, Mushrooms, Roasted Bell Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalape√±os)\n\nChicken Carciofi (Tomato, Artichokes, Capers, Linguini, White Wine Sauce)\n\nConclusion: The food overall was pretty good no complaints on that. If you love pasta then definitely you can't go wrong with the \"Crazy Alfredo\"! My Mozzarella Caprese was good as well. My last complaint which cost them another star was the fact that when we asked for to go boxes the waiter brought them back and gave us the wrong damn to-go boxes. Nothing like getting home from dinner with somebody and finding out that you got the other persons food. And in my case this was a date..so imagine how awkward that was for me?.. Eh I may try again who knows....
