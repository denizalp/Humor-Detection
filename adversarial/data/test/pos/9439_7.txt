Gave Jim's a try hoping the kinks noted by other reviewers had been worked out. We found the prices to be fair for the portion size and taste. However, we did think the burger was rather thin which caused it to be more well-done than we enjoy, but the flavor was decent. The fries were crispy on the outside and tender inside, tasty. These were the good points.\n\nHere's the rest of the story... The service was generic, not friendly but also not cold. It was timely but I had to ask for utensils and the runner only brought me a crude, very used looking, steak knife. I then had to ask for a fork, this was my second mistake (the first is detailed below). It felt like a tedious and inefficient exercise that could be avoided by simply providing even basic plastic utensils for patrons. \n\nThe place was dirty, just dirty, dirty, dirty. We had to wipe our table down with small, dry, paper napkins from the table-top dispenser (and we picked the cleanest table we could find as all appeared quite dirty during our 3 pm visit). This bugs me because I have no idea who was there before me and what they did. And what the semi-moist smudge of viscous substance was amidst the clearly identifiable salt, pepper, catsup, and lettuce was. \n\nThere was a fork laying under the table at my feet and I made the first mistake of the meal, I kicked it out to a visible place on the open floor. When I was forced to ask for a fork, the runner noted and picked up the fork on the floor then returned (in a time frame too short for hand washing to occur) with 'a new fork.' Honestly, I doubt it was the same fork, but she just collected a fork off the floor that had been used by I don't know who, then used her same hands to bring mine. Sorry, that's just nasty... So the aforementioned steak knife sufficed as my sole utensil for the meal. I have more amenities when we camp off-grid!\n\nWe were told when we ordered that drinks had free, unlimited refills but we never saw proof of this 'deal' so take your chances with that... \n\nI'm thinking we will have to be exceptionally hungry with absolutely no other options before we visit Jim's again... That clean thing IS a big deal!
