Minus one star for paying for my chips and the cashier not giving them to us.\n\nThe staff here does a great job at explaining the different sandwich sizes by detailing the amount of meat that goes into each particular size. All of the sandwiches here are unique in their own way from offering items like pineapple, or cream cheese. Me and my +1 shared the Pig Kahuna and were stuffed! The sandwich was full of flavor (with a nice kick from the tabasco sauce) Note: These sandwiches are served open faced, don't plan on folding it or it'll fall apart because there's so much meat!\n\nThough their hours aren't the most Vegas friendly, Beach Hut Deli offers a true \"beachy\" experience with their d√©cor and menu options. I definitely plan on returning to make my way down the menu!\n\nPS. They have several beer options if you're feeling particularly thirsty.
