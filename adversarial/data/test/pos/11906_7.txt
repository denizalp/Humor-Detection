Pulled pork sandwich with a side of potato salad. This is the meal I feel that BBQ places just can't screw up, which makes it my go-to order whenever I see it offered. If Joe's had onion rings, I would have gotten those too. \n\nTheir pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. I liked the BBQ sauce too. I wasn't big on the potato salad. It had a thin sauce, rather than the thicker, mayo-like kinds I'm used to. I think someone mentioned it's like a thousand island dressing trying to hold potatoes together and that sounds about right. Not impressed.\n\nMy friend had ordered a side of the cornbread, but couldn't finish it, so I thought I'd polish that off... that is one very dense, dry square of bread. No wonder she couldn't eat it all! I've had an endless pit of a stomach during this pregnancy and I couldn't finish what she had leftover. \n\nDespite what I'd heard, I wouldn't say Joe's is amazing. And I certainly wouldn't drive all the way out there specifically for their BBQ. I think I'd rather continue on my search for the perfect pulled pork, potato salad, and onion rings.
