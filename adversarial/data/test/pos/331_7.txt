This place makes me depressed just thinking about it.  I look around and all I see are broken dreams and babies wearing shoes and diapers.  Sweet Jesus.  \n\nAlso, I can't recall a single time that I've been to Arizona Mills sober.  Whenever I'm there, I'm under the influence of something.\n\nOne time I showed up to see that movie Land of the Dead while it was playing at the theater and when I got there, I realized like around four of my friends had eaten shrooms.  I was high as a kite, too.  We stopped in at Gameworks and I guess all the colors made my buddy puke.\n\nHere's a testament to the people who frequent AZ Mills:  I showed up to see a zombie movie and I dressed like a zombie, and no one there looked at me funny or said anything or asked me why I was covered in fake blood.  No one thought I was out of place because they, too, are a bunch of mall-dwelling zombies themselves.  I fully expected someone to at least call me a dork or something.  \n\nOne of the cool perks of this place is that it has an IMAX theater.  I'm a sucker for that shit.  IMAX is pretty amazing, especially some of the cooler 3-D features.
