It's a good place. Like every place in Calgary, it seems like it is probably financed by one of the same three people. I also like high ceilings, and the lamps. The lamps look expensive. So decor is a plus.\n\n The expensive cocktail rampage sweeping our fine city for the past 4 years has stomped its way through here. They are the prerequisite $12-$15 dollars, and contain two ounces of alcohol. They are also tasty, and come in many fine combinations. Good people, remember that your cocktail list must have at least 2 drinks that come with egg yolk. TWO.\n\nMainly, I like spending $100+ at this place (when oil was actually worth money) because the chef seems to do two cliches very well: 1) new spins on old favourites and 2) experiment  with stuff that makes most people go \"WHO WOULD EVER EAT SLICED LAMBHEART!?
