I just went there with my sister Boney this past Sunday. Food was AWESOME and so was our waiter. There wasn't a huge selection like other buffets but it's quality over quantity. The tables were also awfully close to each other as well. They could easily use another foot's distance between one another.\nThe low rating is because of the way we were treated by their hostess Eva. Because of her we had a really really bad start to our meal and were debating if we should just dine somewhere else instead. Considering she's the first person patrons see at the restaurant, she shouldn't be rude and unwelcoming. We had reservations for 3 at noon and were COMPLETELY ignored until a little after 12:35-talk about crappy service huh. My sister arrived a few minutes before me and told me the hostess was extremely snooty. There were very few people in the waiting area at first and Eva offered champagne to all of them EXCEPT my sister. She made it obvious too since she offered it to the person in front of my sis, then skipped sis, then offered to the person after. You hussy! U can't treat my sissy that way! \nAfter we were all waiting a good 30 minutes which is completely absurd I walked up to the hostess's podium (she saw me, considering i'm 2 feet away directly in front of her) but she completely turned around and walked the other way.  wat the heck?!?! Boner saw and stopped her as she was about to walk pass him . he had to point in my direction to point out to her i was waiting at the podium. well she never bothered to walk back to me but instead glanced at me then asked him what he wanted. so i had to walk back to where SHE was to remind her that our reservations were for 12 and it is now 12:35. she replies flatly \"did you check in with me?\" , \nuh \"yes we did at 12\" you evil lady. so we had to give her our name and tell her how many of us again.she offers no apology whatsoever and tells us to \"stand over there\" instead where we continue to wait again.\n\nwe were finally seated later but come on, what's the point of making reservations if you're going to be stuck waiting anyway. and if the hostess makes a mistake and completely forgets about you while she lets all the people who came in after you head in, shouldn't she at least offer a simple apology?? \nThe waiting area is pretty small and we were waitng the whole time within site of the hostess. SHE KNEW WE WERE WAITING. If she were doing her job it might have crossed her mind that \"hey, how come these nice folks are still waiting when i've let everybody who comes in after them go in already\".\nThe steakhouse should replace her unless they want a stuck-up and innept hostess greeting their patrons. \nOh yeah, it was our first time and obviously we were not impressed with the way we were treated and to top it off it was my Birthday too. =(\nI initially gave this place 4 stars but now as i write my review i'm so upset and pissed again that i'm docking off 2 stars due to my incident with Evil Eva.
