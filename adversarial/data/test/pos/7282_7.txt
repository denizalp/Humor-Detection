My bf lives here, and his 1-bedroom apt is huuuugeee. Granted, we're comparing it to his old apt in New York but still. \n\nEveryone here is so incredibly nice. It's just so refreshing after all the crap we usually deal with living in NYC where every answer to your question is \"NO\".\nCan we paint the walls? Sure!\nCan we self-park in this valet-only garage? Sure!\nCan we spray paint our end table somewhere in the building? Sure!\nCan we move in our stuff at 9pm? Sure! (And they even helped us unload and take his furniture up to the apt!)\nCan we park our big-ass UHaul behind the building? Sure!\n\nThe cable guy came the same day we placed our order.\nThe A\/C unit installer came the very first business hour of the first business day of the week.\n\nI mean, come on! Is this forreal? How can living be so easy?
