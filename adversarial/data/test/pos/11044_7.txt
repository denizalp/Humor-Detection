If you are reading this all is true!! DONT MAKE AN APPT HERE!!!!\n\n This dentist was new for me, they did a good job cleaning my teeth but I felt like they were just sucking up to me the entire time I was there and then they also gave me a portable charger as a new client gift. They have this thing where you are rewarded for referrals with plane tickets and stuff. All of that is great but seems to me like they are trying to compensate for something. \n\nI came in for a teeth cleaning and they told me it was only going to be $35. So then they gave me a tour of the dentist office and that was weird for me too. Like why do I need to know where the employee gym is and all the offices in the back? Then through each room she introduced me to people. I came here to get my teeth cleaned and that's it. I don't need a tour? I felt like I was being interviewed.\n\nSo anyways the employees were all extremely overly nice which is fine but just seemed like they were trying too hard. Nice is never a bad thing for me if I feel it's genuine and not to compensate for anything or to butter up the client. \n\nI felt like I was definitely being buttered up. \n\nWhich makes me feel uncomfortable. \n\nI can be really nice too and I appreciate kindness always but I just felt off about this place and the overcompensation actually made me want to run out of there. \n\nSo anyways they were really thorough and did all the dentist stuff you would expect. Then she brings me back a quote for $400. I do not have dental insurance so this is why the price is so high. Although, I was quoted $35 so I'm like what the heck?! They told me previously they took my insurance which is not true, so that was their fault.\n\nAnyways I read it over and I guess she needed to do some intense cleaning which I will have done somewhere else once I have dental insurance. She basically made me feel like I needed to have it  done right away and I'm the kindof person that usually feels guilted into these sorts of things. I said no multiple times and she kept making me feel uncomfortable. Also lets keep in mind I had no cavities or other issues, I just need to floss more and I had some plaque buildup. I would have appreciated it if she had been more understanding of my situation and that I don't want to spend half my rent check on and \"intense cleaning\" until I have insurance. I just wanted a regular $35 cleaning. Sounds to me like she just wants my money. I'm pretty sure she gets her teeth cleaned for free though and I doubt she's about to throw down $400 for something like that on herself.\n\nSo I'm like dude I don't have insurance let me get it and then I will do it! \n\nSo now at this point I'm like hoping she's almost done cause I want to get the heck out of there. \n\nThen she finishes up and unlike a regular doctors office she follows me and walks me up to the desk which I thought was weird usually they just walk you to the door or let you excuse yourself. \n\nThen there was some sort of whispering\/exchange of words between her and the front desk about how much it was gonna be which is weird cause I thought I was here for the $35 cleaning I was promised... Then she makes me feel uncomfortable yet again by booking my appointment out for next time when I said I can always make it later then she said she would make it now..\n\nSo anyways they charged me $75 for god knows what. Obviously I'm shocked and I don't want to say anything cause I feel so awkward and taken advantage of and I just want to get the heck out of there cause I had been there quite a long time so I just handed her my credit card. So much for $35 for a cleaning..?! \n\nI left the office feeling pissed. Had they needed to do more and it was going to be extra like $75 I would have considered it if it was necessary. The fact that I wasn't aware and the hygenist was so sneaky really makes me upset. She was nice to me during the appointment and did a good job but it's not difficult to speak up and talk about pricing with your customer if you want to keep their business.\n\nSo then I think I got an email from them or something and then like two cards in the mail all saying thankyou which again, like I said sounds to me like their overcompensating. They had also asked me how I found out about them and I said Yelp and then they really tried to kiss my butt. \n\nI guess they thought I was stupid or something. \nI would like to just return the portable charger they gave me and get money back honestly. \n\nI called to cancel my upcoming appointment the other day and she told me I can always leave it and then when it comes closer then cancel it. If I am asking to cancel it why are you trying to make me keep it. Shady. \n\nNot ever going back here, I also told all of my friends and co workers not to go here. If your reading this I suggest you find a dentist who is honest about money and go somewhere else. \n\nUnless your insurance covers everything then you probably won't have this problem they'll get all the money they need.
