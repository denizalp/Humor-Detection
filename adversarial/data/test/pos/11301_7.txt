I am pretty disappointed in this Louis Vuitton. The workers are very rude here and they're very judge mental if they feel like you weren't to their standards they don't really help you out. We weren't dressed very fancy or anything we were kind of dress down for this location. It was just kind of spur of the moment, walked by it and I remembered there were something I wanted so I kind of went in no one helped us until I went up to someone and was like hey I want this so they end up going back to packaging it for me besides that they didn't even come and asked if we needed help or anything and most Louie ask if you need help or give you a heads up that someone will be with you shortly most lv the workers are very nice and they come up to you and asked you if you need anything or help with anything. Sad part this lv was not busy at all!! There was no champagne at this location which is kind of sucked while we're waiting for them to package my purses although the workers kind of just kept on looking at it but I think some of the workers kind of figured we were buying something so all of a sudden everybody wanted to help us out I guess you got to make the commission but too bad they lost out on their commission
