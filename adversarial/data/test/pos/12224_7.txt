Fabulous. I just got back from the Annual VNSA Book Sale and managed to score $60 worth of books for only $6. The VNSA Book Sale only happens once a year in February and it's always the same weekend. It is free unless you come here in a car. Parking is $7.  I rode my bike over here and brought my backpack. . The last day is the best because everything is marked down even lower. You'll find books reduced from $1.00 to .50 cents! Amazingly cheap! Everything is divided by categories and genres, fiction and non-fiction. Until you've come here and experienced it yourself, you have no idea. The volunteers are more than helpful and all the proceeds goes to charities. It's fantastic.  I love it.
