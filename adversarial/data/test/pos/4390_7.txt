This is the best bar in Madison, hands down.  I actually would place it as one of the best bars in the USA.  \n\nI was there last Saturday night and the DJ they had spinning was killing it (as usual).  I spent two years at grad school in Madison and i stopped here several nights a week.  Good music, good cocktails, and good food.  The menu, while small, is excellent.  If it is your first time there, definitely have the Three Cup Chicken.  I have heard a few people say it is a little salty, but isn't that what beer is for?  The pizza's are all good and they usually have some good appetizers also.  \n\nThe beer selection is diverse yet representative of Wisconsin.  The only knock on this place is that it can get hard to navigate when it gets crowded as it is a small bar.  The servers manage to navigate it pretty well though so if you just grab a seat you'll have no problem getting service.  I hate to even write a review of this place because if too many people (or  undergrads) get wind of the place it might lose it's charm.  \n\nBut as is, Natt Spil, you are perfect!  Now please open a branch down the street from me in Chicago.
