This place is okay! I had a decent time here. \n\nPositives: \n\n1. The customer service was great and good safety equipment with a cool instruction video with Larry the cable guy in it. lol\n\n2. The Go Karts are very fast. So you definitely get that racing feeling \n\n3. The first go kart place that makes you wear a neck brace which is smart to help prevent serious injury.\n\n4. The track is pretty cool and set up so you cant reach top speeds and injure someone seriously.\n\n5.  They give you plenty of time during each race to enjoy yourself.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. DO NOT WEAR YOUR GOOD CLOTHING LOL.  Some cars had oil leak issues which will of course mess up your clothing so that was not cool at all.\n\n2. They allow everyone and their mother to drive which sucks when you are racing a 12 year old who has no idea what he is doing because he made the height requirement. I almost got killed on the track Son !! lol It was an accident fest on my second race because of inexperienced drivers. They should let adults drive with adults only.\n\n3. Piggy backing on my previous comment they need more tracks instead of one track. So that they have beginners drive amongst each other and let the adults with experience race each other which would be much better.\n\nOverall pretty cool experience and i would go back in dress down gear lol. Also they have a Groupon available which I would recommend if going for the first time. I found out about this after the fact lol Also use google maps to find this place because they are surrounded by a couple of other businesses and you could easily miss it.
