This review is so difficult for me to write since I went there on my anniversary and I don't want to make it sound like it wasn't an awesome experience. \n\nIt was romantic, fancy, delicious, definitely memorable. If you haven't dined on their whimsical patio, you're surely missing out. We made reservations a day or two in advance and when we arrived, we asked to be seated on the patio. It was no problem and we were taken to a private table, which was really thoughtful. The scenery was beautiful and the only other guests was a large party under the awning. \n\nThe service was awesome. Our waiter looked like he'd been working there for quite some time and his knowledge of the menu was spot on. He took note that this was not only our first visit, but it was also our anniversary and made us feel really, really special. He added all the unique, fancy touches we needed to feel like we were having a proper night-on-the-town.\n\nThe menu was packed with items, all with pretty hefty price tags. I'd say unless you wanted just plain pasta with marinara, expect to spend over $30 or way more on any entree--meatless or not. For this price I expected the food to blow me away--and don't get me wrong, it was delicious. The taste just did not match the price. In fact, I left feeling confused on how we spent about $200 on two pasta dinners, 2 appetizers and a couple drinks. \n\nI'm certainly the kind of gal who believes, \"you get what you pay for\" and doesn't mind splurging on a great meal out for a special occasion. But when you leave a restaurant feeling like you could have had a better, fresher meal for less coin--it's sort of disappointing. \n\nThe stuffed peppers were delicious, no complaints there. The caprese salad was just not great. The tomatoes were super-cold, a big sign that they were pre-cut and refrigerated. The mozzarella was chewy and also not fresh, but the worst part of the salad was the balsamic glaze. It was TOO sweet, almost like a balsamic caramel that overpowered what was supposed to be the delicious taste of fresh tomatoes and mozzarella. We both ordered different kinds of seafood pastas for our main courses and although my man scarfed his down, I had a hard time making a dent in my dish. It was good, but some of the shrimp and scallops were viciously over-cooked and chewy. But, I will say the pasta tasted freshly made and the tomato di olio sauce was tasty--just not over $30 tasty. Most of what I saw on the menu appeared to be too heavy and not focused on showcasing the fresh, beautiful and SIMPLE tastes of Italian cuisine and fresh ingredients.\n\nI truly believe in this business and wish nothing but the best for them, but they really need to think about updating certain aspects. The prices wouldn't be so bad if the food was fresher and\/or locally sourced. But it is not. The menu is stuck in 1970 and desperately needs a modern face-lift. Keep the items that work, but update what doesn't for the love of our wallets. There is no way they're pulling in the same profit that they were years ago and I guarantee that's why the prices have inflated to these horrendous levels. \n\nI would definitely return to Johnny's and probably stick with their traditional spaghetti, but I'd skip the other things which bump the price tag up x100. The atmosphere inside and out are totally unique to this Cleveland institution--an experience not to be missed.
