The thing about breakfast is that it can be (1) sweet, (2) savory, or (3) sweet and savory. As I could still taste my first breakfast of Cinnamon French Toast from Aunties and Uncles, I needed a savory second breakfast. I ordered a traditional plate of eggs and sausage. What arrived was a little more than I expected. The toast was two GIANT hunks of bread, the sausage had a very particular, but good taste, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I reluctantly passed on their biscuits (which get rave reviews) and their other baked goods, which I will definitely enjoy next time.\n\nEmma's had good service and normal coffee. Overall, it was friendly and seemed to be consistent. It was a more than the classic diner experience I was expecting.\n\nGeneral Diner Cooking Rules:\n1. Eggs will be slightly runny if you order them over easy.\n2. Pork will be just barely cooked or charred until it is an unrecognizable meat.\n3. There will be very little seasoning. Seasoning is your job with the choices on your table.\n\nEmma's was just more attentive to their customers and more focused on plating good food than you usually see at places that subscribe to the \"General Diner Cooking Rules\". I would recommend swinging by for a second breakfast, if you get the chance.
