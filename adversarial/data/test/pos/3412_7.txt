Three words....SUMMER....TRUFFLE....RISOTTO!!!!\nI was lucky enough dine at Postrio as a guest of the GM...so our party of 8 tried EVERYTHING on the menu. The food is wonderful, expensive...but very good...no disappointment here. Now, I probably would have given this restaurant 4 stars, but the SUMMER TRUFFLE RISOTTO bumped them up to 10 stars! I can still taste this risotto in my mouth, I dream about it, I crave it...and I may have called this past weekend to see if they had it as a special again.....sadly, they didn't..... :( I will call every time I go to Vegas, hoping that I will again taste that heavenly SUMMER TRUFFLE RISOTTO.
