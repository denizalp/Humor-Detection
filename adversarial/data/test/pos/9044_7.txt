What a disappointment! Maybe this review is biased but I'll tell you why and let you take it into consideration. Las Vegas is my hometown, I moved away several years ago but my family is still there and I return a few times a year. After my father sold his restaurant my family would go to the Bootlegger Restaurant when it was located on Eastern Avenue. I always enjoyed their food. That location closed and they are now the Bootlegger Bistro on the south strip. The first time I went there it was for lunch on a Saturday with the entire family....my sister and her kids, my brother with his wife and kids and myself. We were all seated in a party room but they never told us that the \"sisters\" would be rehearsing their lounge show singing act. It was loud and they couldn't sing very well, not a good experience. My brother apologized because he highly recommended this place and said their food was worth it. The food was pretty good still but listening to the sisters still gets a laugh when ever I bring it up. We've had other meals at the Bistro over the years and seemed to be going down hill over the years until the last time. \n\nWhen my (then) girl friend and I decided to return to our hometown and get married last January we settled on having the reception at the Bootlegger Bistro, not only because my family had been meeting there for years but because one of the part owners was a high school friend of both of ours. On the night of our reception the service was rushed and rude at the begining when they were serving drinks. At one point my wife was standing in the way of one of the servers while serving a drink and the drink ended up on my wife's wedding dress. The server looked at her like it was her fault for not getting out of her way. The food took forever to be served, I think it was because the drinks were seperate and they were trying to make more money out of my guests. We finally got served. I had the Seafood Fra Diavlo. I only got half way through my meal and had to run to the bathroom. Later I heard that others had the same symptoms, needless to say it wasn't a good experience on my wedding night and for a few days after. Because they were late in serving dinner they rushed into clearing the dinner plates before people were done eating. Maybe that was a good thing. \n\nThe part owner of the Bistro was also a friend of a few of our guests so when we arrived we all asked if Ron was there. We was there but after waiting to see him all evening he couldn't pry himself away from his band and recording studio to say hello to his old friends. I dropped over $1000 in his restaurant, got sick in his bathroom and he didn't have the common courtesy to say hello. I held off on writing this review because I didn't want to write angry. It's been almost 10 months and I can't wait anymore. I'm Italian and I guess some things I won't get over. If you are thinking about having you're special dinner at this place be warned.....they don't care about anything but your money.
