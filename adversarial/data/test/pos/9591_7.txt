My friend and I really wanted to try Gadzooks.  So, we finally went last week for lunch.  It is a cute little place off of 7th street & Osborn.  The downside on this place is that the parking is really small. \n\nThe cool thing about this place is that they make your food right in front of you. Also it is like a chipotle, but they sell enchiladas.  \n\nI got two enchiladas, one with chicken and the other one with short ribs with red and green sauce.  They even put a fried egg on top of it.  OMG it was really good.  So, if you are looking for a place to go for quick and great food.  You should totally go here.
