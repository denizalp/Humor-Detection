I've been here multiple times and though they rush you through ordering, they ultimately are good---well not the other day! I don't know who the girl was in the drive-thru but RUDE and did nothing but blame me for the problem instead of taking responsibility. \n\nI simply ordered and wanted chips with cheese and beef on them. We asked when ordering if this was ok and she never asked what kind of meat, just said thanks and rushed us to be done. Got to the window and we clarify about the meat...she says it would be carne asada....no thanks. She complained saying that would be normally and I need to specify when I order what I want. Hmmm when could I have as you rushed us. Then I told her I just wanted plain beef. After her \"fixing it\" she comes back saying \"it'll have peppers and onions and all in it is that ok?\" What?! No I said plain! I got annoyed and told her to just forget it because I was over it. Again she complained about us needing to specify what we wanted. Maybe it's called asking what someone wants and you clarifying for me? Traditionally at restaurants that's what happens...aka \"how would you like your eggs?\" \"How would you like that burger cooked?\" Yea. So again I explained exactly what I wanted and said she also hadn't asked us what we actually wanted. She said verbatim \"were not supposed to\". Excuse me what?! WHO and WHY would any order be in place. Why is anyone to KNOW or how what the meat would automatically be. \n\nIt was a let down experience and I left pissed. Though they ended up getting it right, her attitude and lack of responsibility was horrible and I will question going here again. Clean up your customer service! Food maybe good but your attitudes suck!\n\nPs. 2 stars only bc the food is good. Not GREAT, but good and standard for the cost you pay (reasonable).
