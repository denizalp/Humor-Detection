First buffet I've been to in Vegas and it was crap.\n\nMost of the food was dried out. Even when they brought fresh chicken parm, it was tough and chewy.\n\nThe curry chicken was good the first time but the when they remade it, it was disgusting. \n\nThey lack consistency in their food.\n\nThe pork buns were dry. \n\nThe establishment failed to tell us we got free champagne with our brunch. They also failed to mention drinks were free (soft drinks, juices etc). \n\nWill never be back here. I advise going to a different buffet
