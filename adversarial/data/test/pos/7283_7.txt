Avoid this place at all cost.  I would honestly give this place a NEGATIVE 5 stars after the experience I just had there.\n\nFirst, my wife is a vegan, and I'm quite used to asking for her food to contain no meat and no dairy (milk products).  She asked for a Vegetarian sandwich, she asked for no cheese on the sandwich, as did I.\n\nI ordered a smoked meat sandwich.\n\nThe atmosphere seemed quite bubbly and happy which was nice, but that's where 'nice' ended.  First of all the toilet that rocks side to side as you sit on it, not cute, and the fact that the cleaning products were hanging all around in the bathroom, also not cute.  The bathroom wasn't this way 'by accident' they actually wanted it to have a 'rustic' feel, and did they ever succeed, I was almost afraid to flush the toilet and when I leaned over to do so, I accidentally turned on what turned out to be the hand dryer behind me, with my butt.\n\nThis is Canada, and not some back-water shed city, this apparently was missed by whomever decorated this place and maintains it.\n\nBack to the food, I returned from the washroom to find the food on our table and my wife asking if there was cheese on her sandwich.  I saw some creamy white stuff and thought, ugh probably mayo (my fault, I failed to ensure there would be none).  Nope, I tried it and it was a melted cheese and mayo mixture, along with some sour cream.  I like to cook and I've become quite used to tasting what I cook, I know cheese when I taste it.\n\nI informed our server, to which he responded \"no no, there is no cheese, show me the cheese\".  He then proceeded after I was ABOUT to show him the cheese to go and get a SECOND staff member, whom also asked me to 'show him the cheese', he then walked over to the counter, back again, and AGAIN insisted there was no cheese.  I went to go to the counter to express how absolutely furious I was that they would even think to play this game with me, at which point he walked right by me, and someone else went to go harass my wife.  I went back to the table, my wife by that point was extremely embarrassed by the whole scene this had become (might I add we now had 2 servers AND the 'sandwich guy' at our table, all declaring no no its not cheese), that she said its fine, we asked for our bill, paid, and promptly left.\n\nI'd also like to add, the deli, while they have many 'fresh' meats on display, is quite clearly store bought.  The meat was completely dried out, not smoked, but completely bone dry, the 'dijon' mustard had absolutely no spice to it and may as well have been a no name brand store bought variety.\n\nNot only will I never visit this place again, but if I can save another poor soul from enduring this 'restaurant', my life will feel that much more complete.
