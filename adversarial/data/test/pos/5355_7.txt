Went to Pho Avina (which I could easily recommend to anyone) a few weeks ago with my 2nd dad and he spies the Korean BBQ place (note their signage all says Korean BBQ and not Chuhgajib) and he grabs a menu and we make note to ourselves to check it out (of course, not until after I checked out the other reviews on Yelp)\n\nSo we head there for lunch today.\n\nNow, I know this about Korean food...I ate kimchi made by the mother of one of my daughters friends and it was good. Beyond that, I know that when I flip on LPGA on television to watch the hottee Paula Creamer, some Korean chick is depriving her of a victory and I am none too pleased but it does appear that they understand food...but I digress.\n\nLunch specials $ 4.95 - OK...I'm suspicious. Includes 3 pieces of california roll, salad, rice, vegetable and entree. Too cheap. \n\nWe order gyoza and egg roll appetizers. Evidently gyoza in Korean restaurant is different than Chinese restaurant but is scrumptious nonetheless. Egg rolls more typical to my expectations and very tasty - I'm optimistic. Tea is in big weird cup with no handle and waaay too hot to actually pick up but tea bag says Liptons...I'm still suspicious.\n\nSalad, underwhelming but I am impressed with silver chopsticks that work well for me.\n\nComes the lunch platter...\n- California Rolls, AOK \n- big mound of white rice, perfect\n- pickled vegables, tasty and interesting\n- sweet\/sour vegetables, tasty and interesting...wishing someone could tell me what it was I was eating but hey, it's all good.\n- meat (I had bbq pork but forget the name) mildly spiced, nice, a little dry but that may have been intentional...my knowledge of Korean clearly fails me here. 2nd dad got bbq beef and it was very tasty, not spicy, much more moist.\n\nWe left stuffed, happy amazed that lunch could be so good and so cheap.\n\nPlace was packed and it's obvious why. Inexpensive, tasty, no disappointments and very clean.\n\nWoman who ran the restaurant wears sneakers and reminded me of a track star because she handled a packed restaurant but hardly seemed to work up a sweat and handled a bunch of to go orders as well.\n\nI have to say...49th Avenue and Thunderbird, two excellent Asian restaurants practically side by side and you can't go wrong at either place.\n\nYou can gorge yourself for $10 here. You could drink water and have a $6 lunch that puts a Big Mac to shame.
