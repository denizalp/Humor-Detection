This to me represents the real Las Vegas that the locals would experience. When you look further than the glitz and glam of the strip you find some charming little (and odd) places. \n\nMr. Mamas offers great food in an odd industrial atmosphere. The restaurant is in a strip mall industrial park. When you enter the building you feel as though you should be getting tires installed or picking up wholesale plumbing supplies. But instead there is a kitchen that makes excellent breakfast food! It's so weird!\n\nMy wife had the breakfast wrap and myself the Cali Omelette. Although they did mess up my order (I had asked for no sour cream) they were quick to fix it and the server was very nice. I enjoyed the food; it was defiantly a step above Denny's. Fresh avocado and more than reasonable prices. I think our whole meal after tax was $16!\n\nNow the weird thing: they refuse to stock peanut butter! I've never experienced a breakfast place that intentionally didn't have peanut butter!\n\nI had a long chat with the server about this and apparently it's not an allergy issue, and many other people have requested it. She begged me to talk to the owner as he \"will not listen to requests from the staff\" and told me a story that only after enough customers demanded did they finally get Splenda despite the other servers all telling the owner how much it was asked for. \n\nI found the whole thing a little weird. Had I not been so full from the omelette I probably would have been more annoyed. I ended up not eating the toast as a result. Just can't do jam. Too sweet. \n\nSo anyway all and all it is a great place to eat. Nothing special or exotic but if you are looking for cheap eats off the strip come on down. Good basic local food in an interesting location. If it were not for the owners not listing to their staff if give it 4 stars. I'll update the review on my next trip to Vegas.
