I've been to this location five or six times since it opened a few months ago. I've tried the meatball sub, the big kahuna, the roast beef and provolone, along with the club. All were delicious but my favorite was the meatball mmmm...so good. If you read the menu, you'll see that the club includes mayo, so be sure and ask for no mayo if its unwanted...the employees are very nice and the manager runs a tight ship.  Tables are almost always clean, and the floor is too....the line is often long,(a good sign) but it's well worth the wait.\n\nDon't forget to try a brownie, when they have them, you will not be disappointed.
