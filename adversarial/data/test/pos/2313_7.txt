I'm giving it 3 stars because of my experience today... I come here a lot for PTO meetings, family time etc... Today I'm in here to just work a little for a change of scenery and this is what I get... A workers son jumping from table to table and watching really inappropriate YouTube videos REALLY loud on his iPad.  Awesome.  The kid is running around the restaurant with just socks standing and jumping on the tables. Gross!
