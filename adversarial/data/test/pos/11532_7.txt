I recently stayed at Vdara while visiting Vegas for a friends wedding weekend and I absolutely loved my stay here.\nVdara is a gorgeous hotel and I think one of the best things about it is that its a non smoking hotel and it doesn't have a casino. \nComplimentary Valet Parking 24\/7, no self parking but why would you want self parking when you could take advantage of the free valet parking.\nI was able to check in at 11am and was upgraded to a 36th floor suite, sweet.\nRoom was extremely clean and I never had any issues during my stay. \nThe rooms are really spacious and with great views, no paper thin walls makes it a huge thing when you have the vegas late night drunks stumbling around.\nIf you're looking to gamble Aria, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan are just a few steps away. \nStaff is top notch and very courteous. \nThe location is really good, just behind The Cosmopolitan but with easy access to the stip. \nThe hotel offers a nice bar \"Bar Vdara\" with a full bar and great food menu. Also they have a starbucks for the coffee lovers.\nPet friendly.\nFree WiFi.\nReally nice fitness center.
