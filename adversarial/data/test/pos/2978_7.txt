Dear Maggiano's,\nI used to love you and want to love you again but tonight was terrible. First off, our reservation was for 6:45pm. At 7pm we still weren't seated and only after reminding the hostess of our reservation did she \"find\" a table for us 5-10 mins later. We sat in Joanne's section. She started off ok, recommended specials, and took our order. She delivered our bottle of wine and poured our first glasses. Well, that's when the service ended. The rest of the bottle was poured by me for my wife and my glasses. At one point I refilled my empty glass in front of her to prove a point but that was lost on her. The food was good as usual but there ambiance wasn't and the service clinched it for us. Will we be back?  Probably, but not any time soon and that's a shame considering we've spent thousands here over the years (not bragging, being honest). Please retrain your team, and by the way whomever was the manager on duty tonight they were invisible. Never saw them all night.
