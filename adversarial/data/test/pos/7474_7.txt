So not worth the money. We ate in the \"formal\" dining room and there was no charm or even real ambience. No decorations except a giant chandelier thing and glass wall. The waiter was snooty and kept trying to size us up...and he took forever. We were trying to get to a show and had to flag him down...twice. My cheese plate was mediocre and the spaghetti seafood didn't have any flavor. My veal carpaccio was the star of the meal (but still not the best I've ever had). And the drink prices? Outrageous! My prosecco was $14 a glass...and that is how much one bottle of the stuff costs at a liquor store. Definitely wouldn't come back here - there is too much cooler stuff in Vegas.
