For my mother-in-law's birthday last weekend, my husband planned a big surprise birthday party for her at Maggiano's, which is an old favorite haunt of his.\n\nMaggiano's exterior is nothing spectacular considering they're stuck on the second floor of a mall, but once you step out of the elevator you're transported.  Giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  The bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back \/ main dining room.  It was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).\n\nWhen our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  It wasn't particularly easy to navigate the space in which they'd placed our party, as they've crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. However, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet \/ battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).\n\nThe ambiance inside Maggiano's was so dark, warm, and cozy that I was expecting more from the food.  The calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  The spinach salad I ordered was GIANT and tasty; however, I wished I'd stopped there.  Unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale\/hard.  It was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and I was drunk, which I'll get to in a minute) that I didn't even think to ask to try GT's entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).\n\nThe adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn't hear).  Throughout our meal I was shocked that I wasn't drinking my wine; every time I turned to look at my glass I could swear it looked as if I hadn't touched it.\n\nTurns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with GT's uncle (who'd flown in from Oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  BAD, SELF, BAD!  Perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she'd like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.\n\nMy main gripe, however, was that GT and I had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"OH, SHIT, SHE'S 70!\" when all lined up properly.  But we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we'd brought them in (though we'd asked that they be put on a large plate).  As a result, they read \"OHSH   ITSH  ES70!\"  Also, although the kind\/patient waiter did light the candles for us, I got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  Regardless of the reason, I thought it very odd that they didn't bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you're drunk on Maggiono's bottomless glass of wine.
