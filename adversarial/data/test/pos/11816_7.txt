The prices are so jacked up its not even funny... wow...\n\n\nAlso , Just gonna copy paste my email which will cover a review of their Horrible customer service:\n\nI called your store yesterday in the early afternoon (july 14th) and spoke with a gentlemen named, who identified himself as John. I greeted john initially warmly with \"hello how are you doing today?\"  to which i was greeted with a very awkward response,,, and then some awkward silence.. I apologized to the gentlemen by saying \"sorry i guess you arent used to people asking that\" in a light hearted manner trying to moving things along, but he became even more awkward... I was genuinely confused at this point seeing how John is the first point of contact for your store. As he clearly cant even greet a friendly customer properly on the phone.. Moving on from this to a more relevant point.. I ask if tickets are available to a particular show (Dillinger escape plan) , he then gives me a long minute long explanation of umms and uhhs and only to say at the end that he basically had no idea. he Said \"these probably wont stick around\" and i mentioned i realize that hence me calling so soon. I never heard back. I asked him if it was alright he could please call me if he knew the information and he agreed and took my name and number. I call the next day (today)  at 3pm to be told the show is sold out, and when i try to explain myself to the gentlemen on the phone i was cut off very quickly to be told once more they are sold out. Im not sure if this is how you guys usually do business but this is extremely poor and rude customer service. I can understand shows selling out, but your staff could use a little but of training as to how not to treat a customer. I honestly wish i could have recorded that conversation , it was so surreal.. And a personal message to john if you read this? thank you for not calling me back
