Recently opened in Downtown Summerlin and already making a splash with locals looking to escape the summer heat, I was a bit of a surprised that Dave & Buster's had not already made its mark on Las Vegas considering the fact that I'd previously visited locations in Detroit and Columbus as far back as the mid-90's, dining never really the \"focal point\" but the arcade a lot of fun and the televisions plentiful for watching college football games.\n\nOriginally founded in the early 1980s, and now nearing their 90th store Nationwide, Dave & Buster's at Downtown Summerlin inhabits the space directly across from Regal Cinemas and featuring a vast floorplan of Food, Games and Sports it was just prior to 6pm that our party checked-in at the podium, reservations well-advised during primetime hours, though any wait-time could easily be spent on the video games.\n\nSeated at a sturdy four-top to the right of the bar, a ton of Televisions positioning Dave & Buster's nicely as *the* place to watch Football, Big Events or UFC in the nearly two-year old shopping center, it was with surprisingly efficient service for a place so new that the evening got started, plenty of managers circulating with the use of headsets allowing the team to fill coverage gaps as small groups continued to file in just as two sizable birthday parties sequentially got situated.\n\nEnergetic but not exactly \"loud\" considering the concept, a bulk of the noise merely that of pop-music and conversation as the gaming area sits a fair distance from the food and drink, positive attitudes and smiles seem to be part of the culture at Dave & Buster's and although the several-page menu may at first seem daunting, the size is mostly a result of pictures with server's recommendations helping to narrow the options into a list that is both well-culled and fair priced.\n\nObviously not to be confused as fine dining, but at least on par with the rest of the outdoor mall in terms of quality and mass-appeal, the order at Dave & Buster's was intended to take a broad look at some of their classics as well as the new Summertime selections, a trio of adult-beverages to start certainly not the Spirit-forward work of a Strip \"Mixologist,\" but at the same time still quite tasty with both the Snow Cone and Tiki drink both the sort of thing that could get lightweights into trouble as the alcohol is well hidden by all the fruit and sweeter stuff.\n\nContinuing to order in threes, a Children's menu affording the ability to taste D&B's famous \"Golden Planks\" in a smaller portion with results par-for-the-course Chicken Strips served with addictive Chipotle Honey Sauce, more interesting bites were found in Grilled Cheese Sticks that saw Manchego put to good use alongside more typical Cheddar and Mozzarella in a golden, crunchy package featuring a gooey center, the Steak n' Cheese Tater Cakes even more impressive as the Hashbrown base was virtually oilless beneath nicely seasoned Beef, Onions and more melted Cheese.\n\nTold that the Burgers were a \"must,\" but also intrigued by Sandwiches as well as some of the Seafood and Chicken choices, suffice it to say that the Maker's Mark BBQ Burger outperforms anything tasted at nearby Shake Shack or Ribs n' Burgers in terms of taste or quality, the 8oz patty grilled perfect medium beneath House-pulled Pork and caramelized Onions, while a delicious half-pound of line-caught Cod fried golden showed an unexpected dedication to sustainable souring, the Short Rib & Cheesy Mac Stack unfortunately falling short of the rest as a result of significant underseasoning.\n\nNot holding back when it comes to desserts, though those dining with small children should be weary that a three-course meal in the middle of a room of flashing lights and temptation will test the patience of even the best behaved boy or girl, there is no doubt a reason that Dave & Buster's Brookie Sundae Tower is featured at the top of the list as three of America's favorite sweets are brought together in a stack of pure decadence, the tender Donut Holes a much lighter way to finish the meal on a sweet note while the Bananas Foster Pie offers a more adult option in a portion better suited for singles.\n\nTaking about an hour to play games after dinner, the range of options each charged a somewhat arbitrary range of \"points\" per play, both adults and children will be challenged by everything from Skee-Ball and Air Hockey to shoot 'em up style games as well as those for which they can win tickets, all-in-all a great way to shake down the food and let the little ones expend some energy at the end of the day.
