World of Meh!\n\nWe went to dinner having read the reviews about the okay food and they were spot on! We had the Giant Pretzel (The best thing we had! Delish!) the Chimmicurri meatballs (eh) then BBQ bacon burger (ok) and a Brat ( no Bueno) If we had not read about the loyalty card\/app we would never have known because our server certainly never told us- they need to train the staff!! Also, the food was wayyy to quick (hint already prepared? Frozen? I don't know but something tells me they are not making this fresh- haven't you watched Kitchen nightmares people?) make it fresh or don't make it at all! I can go to Wendy's for the same burger for half the price! Skip the desserts- not worth the hype!\n\nThe beers were good- go here- eat a pretzel drink a beer but don't waste your money on the food.
