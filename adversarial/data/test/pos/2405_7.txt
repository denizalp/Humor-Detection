As far as the various complaining reviews here on Yelp?  C'mon! Do you REALLY believe that Moishe's, the legendary institution of carnivorous consumption that it is\/was\/always will be, has not had more than its share of complaining in the past 70+ years???  \n\nHaters hate\nWhiners whine\nMoishe's pumps out beef that is consistently fine.\n\nThis is the original OJG deal making dynastic den of dining. Its worth a visit from a historical perspective if nothing else.   \n\nQuite simply, a great place to consume meat in a city that still celebrates steak.  Not even remotely trendy or faddish, just come for the beef.
