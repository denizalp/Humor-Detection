Yes, it's off the strip. Yes, if a girl ask where you're staying, you're gonna mumble it and try to act as if you said the Wynn. HOWEVER.\n\nYou will save money, you'll be close to eateries, close to liquor stores, etc.\nMe and my friends stayed here on a weekend, and it was a great stay. The room was quiet and clean, and the rooms had tvs, dvd players, etc.(all the typical things in a hotel).\n\nThe kitchen was clean, and had cups, plates, utensils, etc. It's great if you wanna cook, which we didn't cook much at all. The rooms are pretty spacious, so you don't have to cram if you were in hotel that was on the strip. \n\nGreat spot if you're balling on a budget.
