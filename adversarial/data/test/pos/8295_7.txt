I had the pleasure of hanging out in the Off Cut Bar at the Nash. Located in Inglewood (recently named Canada's greatest neighborhood in the Great Places competition), there's an awesome vibe as you walk into the bar - it's comfortable, yet edgy.\n\nThe space is roomy, yet cozy with lots of room to sit or stand (I was at an event that had me mostly standing, but I was completely fine with this). The bar is the perfect place to mingle and nibble on fanastically prepared & presented charcuterie plates. The meats, cheeses, olives, breads, and crackers were extremely fresh and delicious.\n\nThe actual bar (where drinks are made) is along one wall, and there are windows opposite the bar looking out onto the street. So, you don't get a closed in feeling, but it actually feels quite spacious.\n\nThe location was once the National Hotel and boasted a speakeasy style bar popular with an eclectic mix of shady patrons. (You can see some of their pics on the wall).\n\nThis was an evening event and I loved how the lighting stayed low even once it was dark outside the windows. It was such a relaxing atmosphere, and as I sipped my wine and looked around, I made a plan to visit the Off Cut Bar again soon.
