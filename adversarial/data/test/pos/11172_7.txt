Wow.  Peace out Center Avenue Slice.  The quality on the pizza has crashed, and the customer service SUCKS!\n\nThe parents ordered a pizza a few weeks back to pick up.  The order was simple: large pepperoni pizza.  When they arrived, the workers said the pizza still needed ten minutes, despite this being longer than the quoted time.  Ok, things happen.  \n\nFive minutes later, a man walked up, ordered, and was given a large pepperoni pizza a few minutes later.  This pizza turned out to be my parents.  Want to hear the solution to this?  The employee gave my dad two options:\n\n1.  He could pay the LARGE price for an already made MEDIUM pepperoni pizza.  Because they don't correct mistakes (WTF?) or do refunds.\n\n2.  He could wait ten minutes for a new pizza.  (What kind of pizza is ready in ten minutes?)\n\nHow long did that new pizza take?  45 minutes.  And the cheese and sauce quality is now on par with Papa Johns or Dominoes.\n\nThe pizza is now passable and nothing more.  No one would miss them if they closed tomorrow with their new attitude.  Bye, Center Avenue.  We will never order from you again!
