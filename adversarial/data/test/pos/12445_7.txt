I came here with my Nieces & Nephew to try it out....First for Me, Not them! I Wanted To Try the Macarons, but when we got there...there were Only 2 left! So I Opted for a Strawberry Iced Tea, Very Flavorful! =)\n\nThere is Very Little Seating, but that was a Minor thing for Me! What Caught My Eye was Their Walls....Painted in Chalkboard Paint! So You Could Leave your Mark, or Just Doodle on the Wall! ** Just a Word of Caution, The Chalkboard Painted Walls do Run Along the Ordering Counter as well, Just Be Careful when Leaning, The Chalk Will go on you, lol!\n\nThe Prices are VERY Affordable, They do have Macaron Ice Cream Sandwiches, as well as your Regular Homemade Ice Cream Flavors...Chocolate, Vanilla, Mint, Cookies and Cream just to Name a Few, as well as ASIAN Homemade Flavors...Black Sesame, Green Tea, Red Bean Lychee, Ginger, Taro, Mango and, Durian! \n\nThey also Serve Smoothies, Teas & Coffees, Shakes & Malts, Sundaes, and My Faves Boba & Milk Teas! \n\nYes, there May be Only One, or Two People Working on that Day, but Just Be Patient, or Try to Be, They are Trying their Best! =)\n\nOverall Experience? Loved it\nWill I Be Back? Haha, Of Course...I Need to Get a Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich! ;P
