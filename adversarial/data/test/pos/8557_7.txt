I worked with DJ at this Spencer's Appliance location and it was the best experience I've had at an appliance store! Spencer's has great deals and DJ was a fountain of information and was able to help me pick out the appliances I wanted. I guess you can get great deals on appliances any where? But what makes the difference with DJ is the customer service and attention to detail that he has. \n\nIf you are in the market for appliances it would be worth your time and money to check out what DJ can get you.
