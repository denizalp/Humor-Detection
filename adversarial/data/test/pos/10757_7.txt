Compared to some of the ghetto Walmarts back home in LA, this one is a gem. I came here at 9PM and I was shocked it wasnt crowded. I can actually see thru the isles. Merchandise was were it belonged, on the shelves and not on the floor. The lines were short, no 40 min wait in line crap. I found what I needed and was in and out in less than 10 min. Wish my local Walmart was like this, lol.
