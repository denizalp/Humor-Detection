So the boyfriend and I are sitting in our hotel hungry and freezing so we go on Yelp to find some food. I come across Dosa Palace and I'm like let's gooooo. So we find this hidden place on the second floor of some building and it's glowing and pretty and bright. Then we look at the menu and we look at each other and we're like...omg..where's the meat? Then we quickly glance around the restaurant deciding whether we should make a run for it because we're carnivores at heart. But we're in Toronto - where else can we go? We don't know where anything is and our GPS doesn't work. We order in scary anticipation as to what we're getting.\n\nHOLY CRAP! The dosa was so good. Thank god we didn't leave. The potatoes, onions, other stuff, good stuff, amazing stuff inside the dosa - I inhaled all of it before I even knew what I was consuming. There was a lot of food. I was stuffed after eating anything and everything on the plate.\n\nJust go here. I promise you won't be let down. I promise you'll want to make a 2 hour trip for it just like I will in the near future again. Hey! Shut down your computer and go already!
