I had so many ppl tell me Sushi Brokers would be a gr8 place to eat sushi at, especially having lived in Japan in for so long.  I believe Hiro Sushi, & have yet to find a find another place that can match them.  \nWhen we walked in, the loud, hellish music reminded me of RA - I hate RA & their wanna ambience.  Strike 1 against Sushi Brokers.\nThe waitress was more intent on making a good impression with my boyfriend, who was wearing his \"Retired from the Air Force\" polo than she was in addressing me.  DEFINITELY STRIKE 2.  I was happy to sign the check AND leave her a $.01 tip in her hand.  Yes, I walked up to her and personally delivered it.\nThe fish was SPOILED. To the owners - if you don't know how to keep your fish at the right temperature, learn, and quickly.  Your fish tastes horrible.
