A great small, clean and tidy Indian supermarket on Gerrard East. \n   \nThe produce section is fresh and organized like a large chain grocery store yet the prices are competitive. Inexpensive dairy, breads, spices, dried legumes and a fairly good selection of Western food mixed in. I got a block of paneer for $3.50 which made me pretty happy.\n\nThere's a real community\/friendly vibe in the store from the staff to even the patrons. This is my go-to grocery when I need to stock up on Indian ingredients and dried goods.
