Had a great time w\/ my little fam of 3. We played puzzles & did 80's trivia (provided by Rambo's!) while munching on homemade chips- dangerously yummy BTW, homemade & made with care.\n\nHad the Pastrami Rueben with provolone (instead of Swiss). Really good! Have had their pork chop dinner and some other dinner stuff entrees before, & really weren't impressed. But, have always loved their breakfast. Can't go wrong with those donuts! Almost had them for dinner....I mean tomorrow {is} Mother's Day. We'll have to go back for donuts another day; went for the chip instead & was happy about it!\n\nCons: Kids corn dog was too crispy, verging on burnt. Bread was too burnt w\/ the spaghetti. Just have the chips, skip fries. My +1 didn't love the spaghetti\/meat sauce at all. I tasted- It's exactly what you think of spaghetti\/sauce in a diner type atmosphere. \n\nPros: Service! Service! Service! Fast refills. Owner checked on us after food arrived.  Servers helped each other for the sake of the customer. Our server was good, comfortable & had a smile. Any problem we had was fixed so fast, it wasn't really a problem at all, so I haven't mentioned it here. That's good service!!!\n\nYou know what, though, we have fun here (with our puzzle-loving 3.5 year old) & just the two of us playing trivia! As long as food is ok & service is great, we will always stop by!
