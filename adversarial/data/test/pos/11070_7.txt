If it looks like an ashtray, smells like an ashtray....then it Must be an ashtray!\n\nThis place seriously needs a renovation.   The chairs are dirty, the gambling chips are dirty, the carpet has pretty much soaked up all the years of cigarette and cigar smoke as a filter.   \n\nVentilation sucks as well.   You can just feel and sense the dirty microbes in the air quality.  \n\nGo back and spend your time in the Golden Nugget, next door.
