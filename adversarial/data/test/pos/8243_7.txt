This was my first Vegas strip club experience, and forsure gotta be my worst from any strip club I've ever visited. The girls on stage really do nothing other than walk around the pole and collect their cash on the floor. Only 1 took her top off. The level of attractiveness and dancing abilities were super subpar. Maybe it being the 6AM shift caused this, but I was super disappointed for what I'd expected from a Las Vegas strip club. Other than that, there were many other downsides to this place. The girls here were extremely pushy. I understand that's part of the job- trying to get money from guys, but at some point you gotta learn how to take no for an answer. Also, I highly recommend showing up with your own single dollar bills. At the cashier if you have them exchange your cash for smaller bills, you'll get \"Crazy Horse Bucks\" that can only be used here, and you CANNOT get them exchanged for real cash back. Would of been nice to know this ahead of time. Also, the price of drinks here is absolutely ridiculous. $12 for a SMALL BOTTLE OF WATER! Sad!
