I would suggest going here and ordering your food right after you eat dinner. That way your food might (and it's a strong might) be out by breakfast the next morning. \n\nCame here on a Saturday around 11:15. Were seated in about 15 minutes. We let our server know that we were in a bit of a hurry (bf had an appointment at 12:30 in Southend, leaving us about 45 minutes to eat) and she put our food in right when we ordered. After waiting about 25 minutes, we went ahead and paid and our server said our food would be right out. 10 minutes after that, we had to hunt down our server and have her pack up our food to go. She brought it to us a few minutes later and offered no apology for the wait. My boyfriend ate his food in the car and I'm standing at my kitchen counter alone eating mine.\n\nThere is no reason on this earth for 2 omelets to take 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen. The fact that we were in a hurry has little to do with it. We were seated with the kitchen door in our line of vision, and there were about 2 dishes coming out every 5 minutes. Are you serious? I'm also not picky about getting an apology, and I know it was not our server's fault, but I was surprised that she showed no concern.\n\nMy food is fine, albeit a bit cold since it's been in a to-go container. And while I love my boyfriend's cat, she's not great breakfast company.
