Great experience!  Duran was there to assist us with check in and check out, and was an outstanding representative for this fine hotel in downtown Cleveland!  The rooms were quite nice, not as roomy or nice as other locations I've stayed in, but I didn't go in expecting the same quality as SF or Dallas. We had a view of Lake Erie from our room, so that was a plus!  We really enjoyed happy hour and brunch at Muse.  Try as I might, I didn't find one ascoted \"lord stuffypants\" milling about in the main lobby of this Ritz.  ;)
