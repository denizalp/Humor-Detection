We came to this place from a friends referral.  We ordered Tea Ribs Vermicelli soup and Hainan chicken.  The chicken was good but quantity was small, basically a small leg.  The rice was good as they put some oil and garlic in it so it was not white rice.  The tea ribs tasted also decent but there was four small pieces of spare rib.  Needless to say we were still hungry afterwards.  But this was not what mainly contributed to my rating....\n\nThere's menu's around with items with no pricing on them.  My friend asked how much was this dessert (Sago with coconut milk).  Waitress replied she had to ask her boss.  Waitress came back and said it was $5.  So we said okay, we'll get one order.  She said okay but we'll have to wait for the boss to come back.  I paused to wait for the reason why but nothing happened so I said why.  Waitress says only she knows how to make it....blank stare from us.  We asked when will she be back?  Waitress said shes not sure since she went to buy shoes....second blank stare...\n\nWe'll just get the bill then.  Bill came, we'd like to pay with credit card.  Waitress says oh we can't take credit cards.  Okay, we dig for enough cash to pay.  When we left we saw the credit card stickers on their window.  Our just desserts was being lied to.  Oh well, fool me once...etc.
