Decent mid size venue for your events.  Very hipster-artsy feel with a fountain to greet you at the entrance.  For this particular promo event, there was an open bar, and different vendors showcasing a selection of foods from raw mussels to caviar to steak skewers to chocolate puffs, to name a few.  There were music being played by the dj, makeup sessions and a photoshoot.  \nThe only thing that could be better was that there needed to be more associates working because dirty plates were piling up fast and people were knocking them over.  The loud breaking sound of china into pieces  several times encouraged some spectators to shout, \"OPA!\"
