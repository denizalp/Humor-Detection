Seems like these types of restaurants are popping up all over Charlotte offering a healthier option to fast food.  The production line set up makes the line easy to flow through if and only if you know what you want, if however you end up behind me, the line more than likely will come to a halt so I apologize in advance.  Anyway, choose your base and toppings and you'll be on your way.  I had the brown rice, roasted veggies(yellow beets, carrots, and cauliflower) amazing,  hummus (not the best tasting), olives, tomato cucumber salad, topped off with greek vinaigrette.  Again, it's a quick serve line, just tell them what you want and they move your bowl right down the line.  I've also added chicken or the braised lamb on other visits and the chicken was flavorful but not the case for the lamb.  They have pita bread that comes with your order and they may or may not remember to ask you if you want it but it's not that great so I would pass but they also have pita chips that don't come with your meal and is an additional charge, they are yummy so pay the extra for them.  The food is fresh and tasty, check it out.
