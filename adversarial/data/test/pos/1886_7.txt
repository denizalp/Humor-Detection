The \"Delano\" is the new fashion-forward young edgy addition to Vegas. Most everyone will recommend \"Della's Kitchen\" in the Delano hotel as the clean & health-conscious restaurant...... \n\nI guess they said that because this place has three juices on the menu??\n\nI ordered a customizable omelet: spinach, chicken, and goat cheese on the side. The only alluring menu item were the polenta croutons. Yes, they're probably unhealthy, carb-heavy, and oily...but one bite didn't kill me.\n\nThe food is overrated and should be a negotiable price.
