I was mortified. I went to this castle because we were in the area. We've been to 2 different castle megastores in the past as well as 3 different fascinations, so I know the typical behavior and standard of really good sex shops. This one had a lady who literally smelled like poop. I was standing next to her and the smell hit me and I just wanted to leave. This same lady was talking to my husband about the wand vibrators and was completely inappropriate. As I've said before, this wasn't our first time in a sex shop, and we've had workers talk about vibrators and wands before, but she was making graphic gestures of the placement and literally acted like she was using it. It was just completely inappropriate and unprofessional. We will not go back to that location. Ever. Which is a shame because I had something I actually was going to buy but it was just too gross of an experience. Just gross.
