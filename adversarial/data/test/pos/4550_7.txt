The 1 star rating is mainly because of the waitress\/hostess we had.\n\nWe ordered an Ahi Tuna Burger with side salad; we thought it was weird she hadn't asked us what kind seeing how it's usually house or caesar. She was also being diligent and asked if we had any allergies, like to almonds or any nuts, we said no. Out comes out food with a side of FRIES. When I brought it up to the waitress, she seemed utterly confused. THEN she asks, house or caesar. She then asks AGAIN if we had allergies. It was like she was taking our order for the first time. She looked so clueless, just blank stares.\n\nWe waited a good 10 mins for this side salad (that we never got) and all we see is her chatting up other customers who had already paid. It took another 10 mins to flag her down to ask for the bill. Since the meal was done and STILL NO SALAD. She then asks, did you get your salad? No. No we did not. Oh, you're sorry? Oh, wait, you're not.\n\nWhen she comes back with the bills, she says to us like she was doing us a big favor, \"I didn't charge you for the salad cause it shouldn't have taken that long.\" WHAT?  WHAT?????? 1) It didn't take long cause it NEVER CAME, 2) It comes as a side with the meal. What would you have charged us for?!\n\nWhat terrible service. The bill thing really ticked us off since it made NO sense.\n\nI've been to the Joeys at Eatons and Shops at Don Mills, and service have always been exceptional.
