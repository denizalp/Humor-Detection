Incredible. Amazing. Especially if the bakery is on the ground floor of your Montreal flat. That's exactly where a branch of this spectacular bakery, Premi√®re Moisson, was located when I visited friends in the city recently. We basically wandered down in our pajamas, waited patiently in the long but steadily moving line, practiced our best French accents, and then more or less pointed hungrily to everything we wanted. A memorable late-morning breakfast in zero-degree (Fahrenheit) temps, with steaming mugs of French-press (what else!) coffee, breads, jams, pastries, and lots of great memories shared. I also bought a really cute penguin made of marzipan for my wife, who was not traveling with me (it was a business trip). But when I returned, she refused to eat such a lovely creation, so he has been our \"freezer penguin\" ever since. We even took him with us from Baltimore to CA when we moved cross-continent. He loves it in his new fridge.
