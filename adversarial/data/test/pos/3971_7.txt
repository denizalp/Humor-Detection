I've been a member of this credit union for a few years now, but haven't tried to do anything for business, except hold some minor accounts there ,until recently.   \n\nBackground:  I'm a small business owner, I have accounts at several other banks or credit unions, in 2 different states, and several loan lines at each those other institutions.  My credit score is high, my employment history very stable, and my repayment history flawless. \n\nA few weeks back, I received a pre-approved credit card offer in the mail offering an incentive to open an account. Wanting to make another relationship with a local credit union (I'm already a member of 2 others), I physically stopped into this location in early March to inquire about their non-solicited offer.  I was told, although my credit score was high enough, the amount of revolving debt I had was too high (Keep in mind, I'm a small business owner, revolving debt is necessary to grow and, for the record, I had paid almost all of that debt off a few weeks before, but the credit bureaus didn't update my score yet at that time).  I was told, if I were to pay the debt and then re-pull credit proving this, there would be no more issues. No problem, that's fair, you don't know me, I understand, so I waited a few weeks and returned (It was then the end of March).  After re-pulling my credit, all debts in question were now proven paid.  I provided all my income sources for the last 3 years and 2017's income, to date, but, it was before April 18th, so 2016s taxes were not filed.  After all this, all of a sudden, bingo, new requirement, \"tax returns for 2016 are REQUIRED\" to apply (Keep in mind, it was still end of March and I had proven every scrap of paper I would use to file my taxes with for 2016).  For good measure, I had also included proof of my assets and my 2017 income.  Using any of the 4 years worth of income I provided, my debt to income ratio was extremely low, but, in 2017, it's almost an unheard of low in the single digits.  Answer from the underwriter, \"DENIED\" because I didn't provide my actual 2016 tax returns.   \n\nI highly recommend you do not do business with this credit union,  the small business that I own is a real estate brokerage.  I've been in the real estate and finance industries in Las Vegas and Henderson for over 11 years now and have an honest and fair reputation.  Throughout the years, I've searched high and low through almost every credit union and bank in this entire valley for my clients' interests and for financing my own financial goals. America First Credit Union is a very poor example of customer service from a financial institution here, I can recommend several that are good, you don't need to waste your time with this one.  USAA or Navy Federal are great if you're a veteran. US Bank (Also veteran friendly) and Aloha Pacific Credit Union I also recommend.
