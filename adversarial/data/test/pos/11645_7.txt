Are you jealous of the lower gas price in Vaughan, because you can't have it when you live in Markham and Richmond Hill area?  Your yearning is answered.  Located at the southern border of Stouffville, just north of Markham and east of Richmond Hill, this Petro-Canada station is usually 1 to 2 cents lower than regular price.  The discount is no match to the 7-cent discount in Vaughan, but it is better than nothing.  The store is a typical Petro-Canada otherwise.  \n\nYou can enter the station when you go north bound on Woodbine by-Pass or east bound on Stouffville Road.  The traffic islands prevent you from exiting the station and turn south or west.  It is an inconvenience, as I must go north to Tim Horton and make a U turn to go south to return to Markham.
