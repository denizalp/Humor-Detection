Sometimes I wish I was Polish so that I can fully reap the wonders of the shelves of this great Polish deli. However, I have been brave enough to try a few items. I love their mustard and pickled veggies selection. They also have oiled herring that goes great with crusty bread or as a nigiri topping. Their deli meats and sausages are great and are reasonably priced.\n\nBut my main reason for coming here is their deli meals. I always pick up their frozen perogies, cabbage rolls, and hunter stew for those weeks where I didn't feel like cooking lunch. They also cook these and I always get it to go. I suggest getting their cabbage rolls, hunter stew, perogies, polish sausage, and this fried meat filled roll ( I call it the polish hammer burrito).\n\nThe only thing I find kind weird every time I come is that everyone that works here looks like they're dressed as dental assistants. It's not a complaint, but I feel like I came for a health appointment. But they are very very helpful and kind :)
