Swizzlesticks makes me want to kidnap people. They're trendy and they know how to cut hair. So when I'm out and I see people who are walking makeovers waiting to happen, it's what I fantasize about. I want to be the instrument behind seeing their business-party hockey hair and soap opera 90's tresses tamed into fabulous modern coifs. \n\nI've been going to Swizzlesticks for 4 years now. I've had three hairstylists. My favourite, Aya, has temporarily left for Japan and I cross my fingers she returns. She's a doll who understands how to make you look your best. Upon arrival, they offer you a beverage, have a plethora of photos to look through for ideas, will do a mini consultation to chat about what you want, have you change into a smock and they'll offer a mini face massage while shampooing your hair. If the massage messes up your makeup, no prob! The adjoining Aveda store will do a lil touchup for you. The d√©cor is gorgeous and comfortable. I only wish they'd change the colour of their smocks -- the black or brown make you look very pasty & unflattering under the bright lights. They have levels of stylists from Advanced to Director so haircuts will run you anywhere from $57 to $100. If you're on a budget, go on Sundays. New Talent stylists, under Director supervision, will experiment on you for $40. My guess is that you'll walk out with something pretty great anyway.
