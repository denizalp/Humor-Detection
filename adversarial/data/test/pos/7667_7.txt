This place is awful.  Nowhere on the website (or at least not in any place that is easily found) does it say that you HAVE to be a guest at the resort to use the water park.\n\nWe drove from uptown, excited to use the park, only to find out that we would need to purchase a room and that it was sold out.\n\nThis should be on the page in bold, easily seen, so that people such as ourselves, who are looking for a good time (and a water park), do not make the trip out.\n\nThanks for nothing.
