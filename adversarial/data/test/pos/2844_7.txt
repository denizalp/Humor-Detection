I wanted to like this place. I wanted to be able to start a sentence with \"At least The Steakhouse in Circus Circus was good...\"\n\nThe sides and garlic mashed potatoes were excellent and the inside was beautifully appointed in classic dark wood and leather upholstery. The waiter was friendly and very professional. The wine was a nice vintage. But the point of a steakhouse is to know what the hell you are doing with the meat.\n\nThe prime rib I ordered was a hot mess. I ordered medium-well and got rare. It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3\/4ths gristle and fat. I performed major surgery to liberate what turned out to be about 4oz of actual meat from the center of this disgusting hunk of beef fat and cartilage. By the time I'd finished sawing away the lard, I was thoroughly grossed out but the huge pile of fat dominating my plate and could barely eat my potatoes and what little meat I had.\n\nSo when the bananas foster came for dessert and it had lumps of un-blended cooking paraffin settled at the bottom like marbles, I was ready to vomit. If you are going to make a thickened caramel sauce and use paraffin, get it to the right temperature to ensure it all blends together. Otherwise customers get a mouthful of what feels like cold grease lumps.\n\nJust disappointing. But I guess that's what happens when you eat at a place that has a huge neon clown outside, cackling its way into your nightmares.
