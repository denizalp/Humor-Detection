I truly wish I could give them a 0 star. The worst place I have ever been to. Before I had even arrived at my appointment, they called me multiple times to confirm an appointment on the wrong date. Once I arrived, the hygienist continued to complain about not being able to get the right X-rays and make passive aggressive comments about how frustrated she was under her breathe. The dentist then told me I had 4 cavities which seemed odd to me. I decided to cancel my appointment for my fillings and go get a second opinion. After I cancelled my appointment, I continued to get calls regarding other patients appointments and confirmations. Then, they charged me $125 for the X-rays and examination I had done. I went into the office and paid. I got a second opinion from another dentist in the valley and I HAVE NO CAVITIES. Today, I get home from work and have an invoice of them trying to charge me another $125 claiming that I never paid. Fortunately, I have my receipt and will be calling first thing tomorrow morning. Please, spare yourself and do not visit this practice. I will never be back.
