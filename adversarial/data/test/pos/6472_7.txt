Don't let the food court setting fool you, this place has got it goin' on.\nA flat $6 for any roll on their menu- and this includes Vegas rolls, Hawaiian rolls, and about twelve other varieties. It's not a crazy-extensive menu, but it's definitely more than Cali, Philly, and shrimp tempura.\n\nFish is fresh, rolls aren't skimpy, presentation is on par with a stand-alone restaurant even when you order to-go, and the staff is super friendly to boot. They don't mind making tweaks or substitutions, either- I often add lemon, green onion, or garlic ponzu.\n\nJust found my new place for getting takeout: 3 rolls under $20 AND I get to take my pants off and watch Netflix? Done.
