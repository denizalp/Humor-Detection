Dumb.\n\nThe one saving grace: Location. Close to Old Town, close to the bike trail, walking distance to Sunflower Market and the Coffee Bean. The price for the location would be good too...If not for what a dismal place it is.\n\nI moved in last summer. I would have looked for a better place but I needed to get out of my grandparent's house, like, yesterday and my income was pretty laughable at the time. So away I went.\n\nMy small one-bedroom had ample kitchen storage and space, which I liked, but the stove was old and dismal and the drawers (rickety and wouldn't open and shut easily) were tacky like they had just been painted...and stayed that way for about a month.\n\nMy bathroom vent had weird build-up in it that sprayed out into my sink. Not a huge amount, but it seemed as if the AC had been turned off for a few months, so black gunk built up and collected in the sink. It grossed me out and didn't fully go away for about a month and a half.\n\nOh hey, another pro: There was good closet space with built-in organizers. Hooray?\n\nI honestly laughed out loud when I saw the picture of the gym on here. RIGHT. The DIM, hard-to-find gym had two ellipticals and two treadmills and a measly weight machine and THAT'S IT. No air conditioning, no TV or radio, no water fountain. Seriously.\n\nSome of the office personnel was nice, but some acted downright offending that I would come in for any reason. I remember I once walked to the office with my laundry because I had to load my pre-pay card (annoying, why isn't this machine in the laundry room?) at about 10 minutes before the office opened. I could see two employees sitting in there, talking, looking at me, discussing their latest attempts at Kardashianesque shit-ton smokey-eye makeup (good job, ladies, a clean and natural look on a fucking Sunday morning) and clearly trying to avoid eye contact. When I finally convinced one I just needed to get my goddamned laundry done, I was treated like a third class citizen.\n\nI've also walked in for some questions with no one in the main room, and could clearly hear people talking (not about work) in the offices...And sat. And sat. And sat. And sat. And left. Good customer services.\n\nWhat REALLY bothered me though, were my move-out charges. I BARELY lived in this apartment. From December to the end of my lease I probably stayed there one night a month average. Some boxes were never unpacked and sat in the corner. I don't smoke and didn't stain anything. My shower curtain bled some onto the tub. I was charged over $300 for that. I read reviews that they'll try to nickle and dime you on the move-out charges, and sweet Jesus did they. I ended up paying them on top of my deposit and pro-rated money I was SUPPOSED to get back for my lease being up before the end of the month. I'm just glad to be done with them.
