My liver is telling me no!!! But my body, my body is telling me yes!!! \n\nSo there's two Total Wine & More in the valley, one in Henderson and one in Summerlin. I live no where even close to one. Whoa I need another drink. \n\nFor me, going to Total Wine & More is like when I go to Fry's Electronics and I have nothing to do that day, I'd spend hours there looking at everything. This is my liquor candy\/toy store. It's certainly the largest liquor store I've ever been to and there's nothing but selves and selves full of alcohol. I wanna drink them all! \n\nThey pretty much have anything you would want to wet your whistle with. Rums, whiskeys, tequilas, vodkas, wines, beers, all kinds of alcohol. Everything you'll need to get the party going, even the non-alcohol stuff. I know I know why!? Buy one, buy two, buy an armful, buy however many you need. They even have cigars too.\n\nThe employees are helpful and knowledgeable when you can hunt one down.\n\nIf they allowed it and my body could take I'd love to sample everything, I got a Saturday or Sunday to kill. But honestly I probably won't frequent here unless I was in the area cause I still have a lot of booze at home and there are a lot of liquor store between me and there.
