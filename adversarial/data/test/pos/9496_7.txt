Grocery shopping made fun, I usually make a day out of this. Ill start off with Dim Sum at Li Wah, refill Eastern healing herbals from Tak Yuen Tong then head to the grocery store where I can but anything from stingrays, jellyfish to my favorite flavored aloe drinks. Prices are very solid, bang for your buck. I suggest not going on the weekend unless you have time to kill, it gets quite hectic. I like the veggies because they have what other stores will never carry, fruits are mostly the same as giant eagle, but less fresh. \n\nAll in all, its just another grocery store, but its the experience. Fun is what you make it I always say...
