I've been meaning to give this place a try for some time now, and today was able to actually leave the office and have lunch outside of the office. This is new for me, as the past 2.5 years I was stuck eating in the office.\n\nOnce you walk in, you place your order with one of two employees and wait for your number to be called. I ordered the 2 piece fish and chips and  was number 510. There was a bit of a wait, which is fine because the fish is fried fresh and served hades hot. The fries were standard, but the fish was fantastic. I found the batter to be light and crispy; the fish was flaky and moist. A cornucopia of dipping sauces awaits at KKL, but I stuck with the Lousianna Hot Sauce and malt vinegar. There's also ketchup, cocktail sauce, ranch and a few others.\n\nWe were fortunate to get there shortly after 11 a.m. before the crowd came in waves.\n\nThe nautical theme is kitchy and inviting in a way that reminded me of something that might fit into Sponge Bob's world. I'm looking forward to many future returns.
