Giving this place one star was extremely generous of me.  Was excited to go here for salsa night with some friends but that quickly soured the second we drove past this place. First - no valet, or at least no sign of valet despite what their website says.  Second - we had to stand outside in the 20 degree temperature for about 10 minutes waiting for the bouncer to find some frat boys ID.  That should have been our cue to run as far away from this place as possible. Turns out, this \"classy establishment\" was catering a party for some frat. As we stood there, 3 overly served, drunker than drunk frat boys pushed and shoved myself and my friends out of their way. One even continued to hit his girlfriend and when I told the bouncer that if he let these kids back in, they were going to lose four paying patrons who actually work for their money.  What did the bouncer do? His response was that \"they were with a party\" and he let all of them back in - despite knowing full well that they were over-served and were already being violent with patrons.  Thankfully the frat idiots never ventured over to the salsa area but the stragglers who did stay in the other room could barely stand up, some were passed out and the room reeked of vomit.  And if there is a dress code for this place, you wouldn't have known it based on the hooker-like attire the girls were wearing. \n\nNeedless to say we'll never come back to this place - if we wanted that kind of night we would have just gone to the South Side.
