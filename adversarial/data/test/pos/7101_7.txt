As mentioned by others before me, this place is a relatively new - but already incredible caf√©. Jesse, the lone employee, maintains a constant energy and friendliness that is bound to appeal to almost anyone.\nThe quality of the coffee is amazing, made from either Path, Timbertrain, Discovery or Transcend roasters. The decor is minimalist, with spread out seating areas and various paintings mounted on the walls. \nThe interior also doubles as a laundromat, with a vending machine that sells some incredibly cool socks.\nOverall a great new place with much to offer!
