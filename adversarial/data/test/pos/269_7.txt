Don't go here. I bought two Reflexology treatments and an Indian Acu Head Massage on Groupon. Already a bargain. The location looked like they did a nice set up. Ambient lighting, soothing music - I promised myself I would check out their menu - until the 40 minute head massage began. \n\nWhile seated the first 10 minutes were spent applying oil. A lot of \"scratching\" it into my scalp. Waiting for the \"massage\" to begin. It didn't. Just more scratching and some light pounding. The face massage was nice but the therapist did it by extending my head right back with no support behind my head\/neck. Why he thought applying pressure to my torqued spine by pressing on my forehead was a good idea is beyond me. Being stupidly polite I made him stop only when my left arm began to go numb (I'm not making that up to sensationalize). I asked what kind of oil he was using - coconut is popular in Indian culture for scalp and hair, and olive oil is big for moisturizing properties as well. \"Carrier oil\". A vague answer at best as all oils are carrier oils. \"It's a pleasant smell\", I replied.  And comforting I thought. Comforting because it reminded me of something - Baby Oil. Mineral oil was used. Odd because on the spa history form I specifically wrote that I'm allergic to Mineral Oil because it causes bad breakouts. And regardless, who puts Mineral oil in their hair?\n\nThe Reflexology was simply a pleasant foot rub. No real pressure was executed. I tipped her because I really don't think that she knew any differently and I was using a discount. So even with the Groupon, paying taxes and tip, the experience still cost me $100.\n\nNot. Worth. It.
