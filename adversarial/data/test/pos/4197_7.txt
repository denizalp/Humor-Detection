Oyster Bar in Palace Station is legendary for a reason. Just eat here. The pan roast is still every bit as sensational as the last review I wrote, and the combo pan roast with lobster will always be the stuff that your dreams and happiest memories are made of. \n\nHowever, this time my review is to emotionally prepare you for your experience. I like to show up to Oyster Bar when I'm alone; Americans always have the need to space themselves out from strangers, and more often than not there's an empty solo seat. =Cue my entrance, please=\n\nHere's what to bring if you show up during summer season or anytime (roughly) before 4AM or after 10AM:\n- Camping chair\n- A roadie (maybe you can flag a cocktail waitress down)\n- A few activities like crossword or Sudoku books (or coloring books, but no one under 21 here)\n- A ton of money to beg everyone else in front of you to let you cut in line\n\nGreat, now that we've established that the wait here is rough sometimes, you've finally made it to the front of the line and are about to pounce on the seats that just opened up. Staff will- with restraint- ask you to wait until the area is cleaned off. So hang out by the rope and just wait to be called. \n\nI knocked this place down in stars because I'm tired of putting up with the staff's bullshit here. In the past 1,000 reviews, I've only commented negatively about staff one other time (The Mule in OKC), given that I'm a bartender myself. \n\nThe past two times here, the older servers have treated me like a burden and made zero effort to be pleasant at all; no thank you, no smile, no response except an order call back and a refill dumped on the counter. The whole thing straight up makes you feel BAD, and who the hell goes somewhere to eat and leave feeling like that? (If you didn't think it was possible to toss a drink at someone... it's possible.) \n\nTo the staff, if you're worn down from the tourist grind, get out of it and make room for someone who wants to be there, especially since money isn't ugly here. \n\nWill it stop me from coming back? Nope. The food is amazing. And I still tip well because the cook ends up being nicer than the server, and the cook is part of the tip pool. \n\nMaybe next time being a little nice to people will be on their menu, too. Or maybe not. Whatever. Pan roast and ignore.
