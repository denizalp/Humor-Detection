Studio B Buffet is located inside the M Resort about 15 minutes from The Strip. Our guy friend suggested it for Friday night dinner ($34 per person) & since he was willing to drive, we were down to try it. \n\nThe 7:30pm crowds looped around the line dividers as if they were waiting for the newest Disneyland ride. We were seated in about 50-55 minutes.\n\nThis buffet is humongous; I think I read there are over 200 items which made me think it might be a quantity over quality type of place, but that wasn't the case. Food was actually really fresh. \n\nThere are the different sections: asian, pastas & pizzas, sushi, Indian, the carving station, the seafood area, etc. I'm not usually a pasta fan, but the baked ziti was SO good. I kept going back for more of that tart & creamy sauce. The breading on the fried shrimp were not too crisp. I had a pork rib which had a nicely-spiced rub & was not too fatty. For dessert, I loaded up on mini red velvet cupcakes (yay for cream cheese frosting!)\n\nThree stars because I normally wouldn't drive too far from the strip for a buffet with a longass line. I had a handful of pretty good items but everything else was not memorable. I ended my meal with an espresso shot laced with amaretto. I'm thinking a lot of high ratings are given because wine & beer are included in the price of your meal. I'm not a beer & wine kinda gal, so that perk was completely wasted on me. Now, had vodka been flowing freely, I might also be inclined to give a high rating...
