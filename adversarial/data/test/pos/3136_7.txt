As a pizza snob from New Jersey, I have been here a few times as I live here now. Unfortunately, I can't eat pizza as much as I used to. :( but this is the only place for REAL pizza.  As for someone from Connecticut complaining about a veggie pizza...What's the point? That's like having de-caf in the morning!! The owners knock themselves out to make a fine product in order NOT to complain.  NJ\/NY Pizza Snobs UNITE!! Nothing Better.
