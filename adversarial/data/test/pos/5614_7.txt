Listen, you know what's at a buffet.. Really, you do.. You've been to one, then you've been to about 99% of them around Vegas.. The only real difference that separates a good buffet from a bad one is no longer choice or selection size.. but the supreme factor: quality..\n\nAnd my friends, The Buffet at The Wynn is definitely fighting for the top dog spot..\n\nJust go, it'll be worth every penny spent..\n\nRecommendations: Go around 3pm, so you can get in for the lunch buffet prices.. you'll end up getting the dinner selection because around 3:30pm they make the switch seamlessly.\n\nWarnings: The wait will likely be long, so don't get assed out.. go early\n\nP.S. 100th Review! Hooray, no one cares haha
