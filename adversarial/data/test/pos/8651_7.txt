Moved here 2 1\/2 years ago, moving out now...\nThe apartments are very beautiful and comfy, ill give u that. but everything else suck:\na. 3 different management companies in the past 2.5 years. no body knows whats going on and its hard to get answers or help from the managers.\nb. maintenance of the ground suck! hallways are dirty, so does the inner yards.\nc. SECURITY - this is the main reason we are moving out. because of the changes of managing company, security was on and off (this neighborhood is not nice) and in the past year there have been more and more break ins. a month and a half ago, couple of guys were robbed at gun point in the hallway inside the building!!! out side of my door!!! and the management wont do anything about it...\n\non top of it all they wanted to raise my rent by 100$ for the renewal of the contract!\n\nbottom line - stay away.
