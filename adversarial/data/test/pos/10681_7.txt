Ah, if only I could give zero stars...\n\nI was not going to review this place because management had changed and I thought they were improving, but apparently not. I lived at this apartment (previously called Cottage Grove Apartments\/Grove@ Rebel Park\/Avenue 965) for almost 2.5 years while finishing my degree at UNLV. I just moved out in December when I graduated and am writing this as a WARNING to my fellow students who think, like I did, that a good location is worth putting up with the mismanagement and unsafe conditions--it's not. \n\nI'm not going to talk about the cockroach problem or the fact that my unit didn't have a smoke alarm, and my only door was a sliding glass door that had been put on backwards so anyone could open it by lifting it up.\n\nI'm not even writing this review about the pretty much nightly shouting heard from various other neighbors, the fist fights happening right outside my (glass) door, the police coming to my door after said fights had occurred, or being woken up in the middle of the night by people literally running through the center of the complex screaming at the top of their lungs. \n\nAdditionally I'm not going to focus on the fact that the hot water in the complex was completely out for OVER A MONTH and nothing was done about it, or the countless times they would turn off the water or do some kind of construction (like putting on a new roof early in the morning) and never notify the tenants beforehand. After having the water turned off mid-shower a few times I learned to take much faster showers!\n\nI could tolerated all of the above because of the location near UNLV and my class and work schedule made the idea of looking for a new place to live beyond overwhelming and time consuming. \n\nThe events that really made me consider moving and motivated me to write this (long) review is more the quality, or lack thereof, of management that Cottage Grove has seen. First of all let me say every few months or weeks there is a new manager\/management company so whoever is there now may not be there in a few months.  A few managers ago, their \"books didn't match up\" and some shady activities had been going down. They called me in early and told me even though my lease wasn't up I had to renew it now or otherwise my rent would go up a lot. When I told them I would be graduating and wanted a 4 month lease or month-to-month, they said I could only do a 6 month lease and that was it. Additionally they raised my rent. \n\nFlash-forward to the next manager who actually knew what she was doing. She told me that they frequently do month-to-month leases, she didn't know why I had been misinformed, she did NOT have a copy of the new lease I had been told to sign, and my rent in the computer was shown at a lesser amount than what I had been paying for the previous few months. I told her because of the hot water being off for a month, the NV housing code says that is grounds for breaking my lease and could I break it early so I could move out in December, after graduating as I had originally wanted. She told me because there was no copy of my most recent lease that would be fine, and to just give my 30 days notice December 1st. \n\nA week before my move date NEW management and owners came in yet again. I went in to double check with them, that moving out was still ok. They said yes, everything looked fine. Now here I am mid-January getting a notice that I owe over $1,000 for breaking my lease!! When I called, whomever I spoke to apparently found my old lease and has no record of ALL my discussions with any of the other management teams. Why am I being penalized for the collective terrible record keeping, communication, and management? I have no idea. But after dealing with B.S. for almost 2.5 years and then being forced to pay this ridiculous sum, I now truly realize what kind of establishment I was living at all that time. Many friends had told\/asked me to move because they saw what I didn't and now I wish I had listened to them. I'm sorry for this long review but I hope others can benefit from it and take my advice--FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE!
