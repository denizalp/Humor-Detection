The music scene in the Scottsdale\/Phoenix\/Tempe area is often characterized as \"lackluster\" . . . correctly. Thankfully, a few of the local movers and shakers are beginning to recognize that fact and are taking steps to change it. \n\nThe owners of the Clubhouse are among them. As exhilarating as it has been to catch Creed cover bands reveling in their success at bars from Glendale to Chandler for the past 5 years, Arizonans are ready for the real deal. The Clubhouse has brought up and coming indie acts like M. Ward, Citizen Cope, Aesop Rock, and Pitchfork favorite Sparklehorse - and has even generated enough momentum to bring to town old-school indie innovators Of Montreal. It makes you think that if any dignified but non-radio-friendly rockers are coming through the Valley, they will be plugging in for at least a night at the Clubhouse. \n\nThe venue itself is modest in size, cleanly divided into a roped-off bar area and an all ages section up front for the kiddies and the avid audiophiles. Even from the deepest bar stool, the sound is crisp and the view isn't much more than mildly obstructed, so you can swig down your beverage in peace and not worry about headbanging dreadlocks shuffling your ice cubes while you're not looking. \n\nMy favorite aspect of this place is that it is such an unexpected triumph. It's dropped into a bleak strip mall, like any other consumerist monument to capitalism that is peppered along the Phoenix grid. But walk inside the door and you feel like you've disappeared and reappeared in a cultural hotspot, where the people are as unique as the rose in the sidewalk that this venue is coming to represent. \n\nIf for no other reason, I give this place my whole-hearted thumbs up because it has done what very few other Phoenix concert spots have managed to do: not suck. Congratulations, Clubhouse.
