BEWARE-they will try to rip you off by recommending unnecessary services.  They also charge vague \"shop fees\" that they do not warn you about.\n\nI took my old Toyota in and they recommended a transmission flush.  The service manager was very pushy, so I reluctantly went head.  A couple hours later, I get a call saying that my car is so old is cannot handle a high pressure flush, and that they would need to replace a fluid line and order new parts.  They were very pushy, so again I reluctantly went ahead.  \n\nA couple days later while waiting for the part, it all of a sudden dawned on me that such an old car does not really even need a flush.  A simple drain and fill would be more than sufficient.  I called to cancel the service and refund the part, but they refused at first.  After much hassle, I finally got my refund.  \n\nIn general, I would avoid their parts\/service department and go to Alternative Solution or the Lusty Wrench instead.
