Perfection. \n\nSix of us chose this as our \"big\" meal out in Vegas. Terra was our server and she was eloquent, very generous with advice. \n\nStarted with an amuse bouche of toast points topped with chickpeas tossed in a black olive tapenade and sweet basil. Garlic tempered with dulcet tones of basil and fresh bean. \n\nThe antipasti dish is served by the person and varies depending on the night. They have a big storage area for cured meats. Four of us tipped in and we got six types of salami. Simple food but extraordinary tastes. The prosciutto was buttery, soppressata brought the heat, the sage spices dominated and then we discovered the chewy bologna. But best of all? It comes with a bag of steaming savory sopapillas. Tiny little pillows of heaven. \n\nI got the octopus appetizer, which was thick as a good steak but tender, no chew at all. They served it with a pungent pepper chutney and some thinly sliced radish. Tasted very spanish, paired with some house cured olives and peppers. \n\nAnything with fresh produce or herbs was a hit. They've got an exclusive herb grower, Paula Pudwell, who provides them with all the main herbs as well as some lesser known types, like mint lovage. Apparently they grow well in the arid Vegas soil. We had no complaints, especially when the mint straciatelli gelato hit the table. They've also got an exclusive forager, Kerry Clasby, who travels throughout California to track down their produce. They say that its driven out each night to arrive fresh each morning. Quick tangent. Apparently they've organized a local farmers market on wednesdays for these products. It used to just draw cooks but now it draws the larger community or so they say. \n\nMy two minute sicilian lifeguard squid was tasty but next time I'd go for a chop entree or the pasta bolognese. Perhaps more boring but so comforting. I did enjoy the beef cheek ravioli with duck liver. \n\nMy highlight was the yogurt semifreddo. House made yogurt served semi-frozen with an almond dough base topped with candied dates and honey. I was stuffed but then they brought out tiny desserts, a triangle of apple gelee and a petite orange cornmeal biscotti.
