The inside of the store is bright and that is what caught my attention. We went in and were greeted immediately. Right away I noticed the different sections and colors of jewelry. It was my first time in the store so I was really shocked at how cheap everything was. I'm not into cheap jewelry that is going to fall apart after one or two wears so I really didn't look at any accessories, but I did browse through the clothes and found a cute top for under $20.00.
