Customer service is excellent.\nFood is amazing.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Toronto. We called and placed an order and we requested that we will come and pick it up, but once we arrived we changed our mind that we want to dine here. They were so nice and without saying anything they said sure, we will prepare a table for you. We were 10 people, quickly they organized a table for us and our food was ready. \nThe food was beyond excellent, very tender and fresh and we requested more appetizers and side dishes. They prepare it quickly.\n\nIf you live in Toronto or visiting Toronto and want to try Persian food. I'd highly recommend Shater Abbas.
