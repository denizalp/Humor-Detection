We actually had a very scary incident. We arrived in our room only to find a pill . My husband and I are both nurses so I freaked out and called my pharmacist friend . The pill was Ritalin people use this in Vegas to stay up all night . My son has a heart issue and had he taken he pill the repercussions would have been catastrophic. We were changed rooms and given tickets to the seigfried and Roy secret garden but is this enough. I'm glad nothing disastrous happened , but I do think should be compensated at least for one night stay. I will writing this review on all websites and going to give corporate a call. Had my son taken this pill you better believe it would be all over the news ! Stay away if you have kids. Go somewhere else
