Dear US Airways,\n\nYOU SUCK!  If I could give you 0 stars, I would.  I only chose your airline from Expedia because it was the cheapest one which brought me from Las Vegas to San Francisco.\n\nFirst off, my flight from LAS to SFO on March 7, 2010 was delayed 2 hours.  Upon arriving to your A5 gate, your screens which usually tell your flight number and departure time was not working.  What does a person do to find out the departure time?  Ask a representative!  Her response was \"uhh...whenever the plane gets here, the people deboard, we clean and then everyone gets on\".  Ummm...really?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to find that out!  Your customer service SUCKS!  \n\nI purposely don't check in luggage if I'm gone only a couple of days because you are not Southwest, you are not free.  Apparently, they announce that we're on a smaller plane and the plane cannot accommodate roller luggage, but we can leave them on at the gate and they will check in the luggage at no charge.  Instead of picking up our luggage at the carousels once we got back to SFO, we had to wait in the FREEZING tunnel area once we got off the plane.\n\nYour tiny plane (a row of two seats on each side) is very unaccommodating.  The lady who sat next to me was not fat, yet her elbow constantly kept going into the side of my arms because we have to sit on the plane like sardines.  You seats are horribly hard and I think I feel the support bar, please upgrade your cushions.\n\nWe were served one drink.  No prezels.  No peanuts.  You want food? You need to buy it.  \n\nUS Airways, unless you pay me to ride on another one of your aircrafts, I will not be flying with you again.  I'd rather pay $20-30 extra and sit in comfort on another airline.
