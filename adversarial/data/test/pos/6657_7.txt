Straight up. The most American place that I have eaten at in Vegas. Bacon. Beer. Alcohol. HUGE portions. Chicken. Waffles. BACON in WAFFLES. Pancakes. Burgers. And so much more. Oh and did I mention, these portions a freakin' HUGE.\n\nMy friends and I came here for breakfast after a long drive from the Bay Area. We knew we needed a big breakfast to give us some energy for the day and for EDC.\n\nWe arrived around 9:45am or so and was promptly seated. The place was already super packed. As we walked by the tables, I took a peek at what other people were eating and wow. I don't know how people can finish an entire portion. (Maybe this is why America is so fat...although...the food was bomb).\n\nMy girlfriend and I shared the signature sage chicken and waffles ($18). If you look at the pictures, you can see that the plate comes with two large pieces of fried chicken, 4-6 pieces of bacon infused waffles and a lot of onions and sage. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything tasted really good. The chicken was soft and tender on the inside and the Bacon\/Waffle combination was amazing. Forreal though, it was more than enough food for 2 people. One of my friends, did however, finished his entire meal...\n\nOur server was amazing. He kept coming back to check up on us and made sure we were good. He encouraged me to eat my greens as well!! \n\nOverall, great food, huge portions, great to split! Come if you're on a date or hungry enough to eat for 2!
