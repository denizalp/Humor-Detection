Nice entrance upon walking in & around, everything is clean & not cluttered.  I love the Nordstrom's Cafe & the Tomato Soup, which they sell by the jar.  \n\nThe jewelry section no longer carries my fav Bony Levy or Origins in the make-up area.  The shoe selection seems to have gone down hill, along w\/ the third floor Juniors section, by the cafe.  \n\nI really like the second floor where there is a small counter towards there door to pic up hidden gems or jewelry, purses & scarves that are unique!\n\nThe employees are always friendly & helpful.
