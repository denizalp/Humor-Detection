Cafe 260's neighbourhood is a strange enigma to me - i'm always surprised when i'm there what a sterile sort of area it is, seemingly filled big boxy buildings and little charm.\n\nAnd then when you step into Cafe 260 it's like a cozy hug - welcoming, warm, and the promise of delicious beverages! There's a mix of regular tables and chairs as well as side table\/armchair seating - the latter is nice if you'd like a bit of natural light especially. \n\nVery decent range of tea and espresso-based coffee drinks on offer (my soy latte was tasty and in a HUGE mug, great value), including a crazy \"Red Eye\" which is an Americano with a shot of espresso added. Oh yes, yes there is a college nearby. I bet those students can't resist.\n\nI'm holding off on a fifth star just til I can go back and try the coffee again and sample some of their vegan snack offerings (sandwich options, and it looks like sometimes even soup of the day). But it's a super-solid four stars for now, for sure!
