If you're in the area, stop by The Bagel Man for a bagel for breakfast ... you won't be disappointed! We finally found the opportune time to go in & I got something a little different - a cheese bagel with scallion cream cheese & my date got the Egg & Lox bagel with the works. The bagels were really big and fluffy; I'm hoping they're hot and fresh the entire day, but as we had gone in pretty early in the day, they definitely were. There was a bit too much cream cheese on the bagel but it was easily spread off.\n\nI'm a huge fan of bagels as it is, so it's plain & simple - we'll be back!
