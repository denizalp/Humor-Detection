Still 5 star service, baby!\n\nStarted the 07 TL for work this morning and noticed a horrible 'moaning' sound from the engine area especially when I turned my steering wheel right or left.  Drove fine to work but it was still bothering me.  \n\nChecked out some Acura TSBs (technical service bulletins) and found this is a common issue for my year TL especially in cold weather (today was colder than usual and raining).  Turns out it is an o-ring in the steering pump assembly that when it shrinks in cold weather allows air to get into the power steering fluid reservoir allowing the air buildup to cause the moaning sound in the engine area. \n\nTexted Kawika over at Island Auto Service that I may be brining in my TL for a quick look, that it may be related to the power steering.  I get a text a little later from him to bring it on down to the shop. \n\nFound the correct Acura TSB and found what parts I needed.  Called my local Acura dealership to inquire if the o-ring and some extra Acura power steering fluid was in stock.  Sure enough it was!  But I was unnecessarily hassled by the parts guy at Acura.  He inquired what I would need the parts for and I told him about the well-known TSB.  He said that may not fix the issue and since the car is 8 years old, I should get the ENTIRE power steering pump assembly changed out, which would include new o-rings.  Out of curiosity I asked how much that service is...I get quoted over $750 NOT including labor!  HA!  Yeah no thanks guy.\n\nDrive down to Las Vegas Acura and purchase my o-rings needed and a bottle of Acura power steering fluid.  Hop back in my TL and visit Kawika at Island Auto Service right down the street mere blocks away.  Show Kawika the Acura TSB, show him I have the o-ring and a bottle of Acura power steering fluid, show him the online video on how to replace the o-ring...and he's off!  Took him less than 15 minutes to change out that bothersome o-ring, top off my power steering fluid, and get me back on the road all within my lunch hour.  Guess what?  NO MORE moaning from my power steering!  \n\nCost?  $7 and change for the parts!  I take all my cars to Kawika & crew at Island Auto Service and he hooked me up this time with service non gratis.  He ended up only having to take out one bolt to replace the o-ring on the power steering hose before putting it back together.  Now that's what I call service!!\n\nNO KA OI!!  (that's 'THE BEST' for you non-Hawaiian types)
