I'm new to the neighborhood and have to have Chinese. This was closest so I checked them out. Brought home $30 in food You get free stuff if you buy a certain amount. They shorted me on the free eggrolls. The food was so bad no one would eat it, not even the dog. That was $30 in the trash! One star cuz they were friendly. Told me next time I come in they'll give me the eggrolls. Try Gol\nden Eggroll. About a mile away and great food!
