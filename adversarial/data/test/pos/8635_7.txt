I have been here twice for lunch during the work week and have ordered carry-out both times.  \n\nThe Yellow Curry with Soy Chicken, which came with rice, was very flavorful and had exactly the right amount of spice for a curry dish.  The portion was good and they were not skimpy with the vegan chicken. It was a very filling dish and I had enough for 2 days. \n\nOn the second visit, I ordered the Grand Tempura.  This dish is an appetizer, but was large enough to be a meal for me. It came with tempura battered vegan chicken, vegan shrimp, and assorted vegetables. I spotted broccoli, red bell peppers, onions, and sweet potatoes amongst my veggie variety.   The tempura dish came with a delicious sweet chili dipping sauce.  The problem is that they only give you one sauce, all of which you'll sop up 1\/2 way through this dish.  An extra sauce is $2. TWO dollars for a 0.25-0.50 cent cup of sauce.  Outrageous. The dish should come with 2 sauces already, based on its size.  \n\nI don't like feeling that I've been over-charged, so this issue has kept me away for almost a year.  Being that the food was good, I plan to give them another try, one day. 4 1\/2-star food, 2 1\/2 stars for petty larceny.
