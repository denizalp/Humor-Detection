Today June 7, 2016 is National Chocolate Ice Cream Day. I celebrated it in the Sunset at Mountain Vista Baskin Robbins. Little did I know that I would also be celebrating strawberry ice cream.\n\n     This year I am challenging myself to celebrate 25 of the 365 National Calendar Days. In preparation of this Yelpy challenge I scan the National Day Calendar at http:\/\/www.nationaldaycalendar.com\/ prior to choosing the days that I will celebrate. This is a fun way to explore different places and foods or beverages while planning days to celebrate these delicious food and beverages.\n\n     I am no stranger to this Baskin Robbins. Although I had never stepped foot inside it until today, it has been so near to me when I shop at Smith's. Now, it looks like I was missing out on years of enjoying delicious ice cream cones here.\n\n   There was zero effort finding a parking spot. There were plenty of spots outside Baskin Robbins and the adjacent vacant hobby shop. When I left the 108 degree Las Vegas heat for the inside of the air-conditioned ice cream shop there were two friendly employees who greeted me. The friendly woman that took my order let me know that today the kids scoops are 99 cents. Now I will let you know that on Mondays and Tuesdays this Baskin Robbins runs a special where a 2.5 ounce kids scoop of ice cream in a cup or cone is only 99 cents. This special pertains to both kids and adult kids. \n\n   I brought my waffle cone of chocolate ice cream to one of the six tables that looked over the plate glass windows of Mountain Vista Road and the ice cream counter. As I celebrated National Chocolate Ice Cream Day, my mind was thinking of what the nice woman said, \"Do you want more than one scoop?\" As I licked the chocolate ice cream to oblivion my eyes were taking in all the ice cream flavors in the display cases in front of me. Baskin Robbins is known as 31 Flavors; and in all honesty I appreciate many of them a great deal more than chocolate. My favorite Baskin Robbins flavor isn't a unique one like bubble gum or strawberry cheesecake. My favorite Baskin Robbins flavor is Very Berry Strawberry. With the National Chocolate Ice Cream Day festivities over, it was time to become reacquainted with Very Berry Strawberry. If this sounds like I was overindulging in ice cream, this is not the case considering that the average sundae is two to three scoops.\n\n   My appreciation of Baskin Robbins Very Berry Strawberry dates back to 1980, when Grandpa Monroe treated me to one at the Hewlett, NY location. I must of been six years old at the time. Little kids make excellent food critics. If I was yelping with a Playschool phone my rating would be 4 stars. I remember vividly as a little kid being impressed with the large strawberries inside the delicious strawberry ice cream. Subsequently throughout my childhood and teenage years my dad would treat me to the Baskin Robbins in the Smith Haven Mall (Lake Grove, NY). Very Berry Strawberry would remain my favorite flavor with Jamaca Almond Fudge as my second. Today in a Baskin Robbins over 3,000 miles away from Hewlett and Smith Haven Mall the Very Berry Strawberry tasted just as delicious as it did when I was a child and teenager. In a way I was reconnecting with my childhood.\n\n    The Mountain Vista at Sunset Baskin Robbins gets my stamp of approval. I especially recommend visiting on Mondays and Tuesdays when the kids scoop cones are 99 cents. This is a neat way to try the 31 flavors. In reality any day is appropriate to enjoy Baskin Robbins.You live once, why not treat yourself to a scoop or more of Baskin Robbins ice cream once in a while.
