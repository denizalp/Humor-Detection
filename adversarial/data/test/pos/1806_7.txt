Went in for a shellac manicure. Selection of shellac was minimal, could only choose what was on display and didn't even see the full selection since there were bottles scattered at all the stations. The woman that did my nails was continuously distracted during my service, looking at the door - who was coming in, the other techs doing their work... She spoke very quietly to me to do things. That being said, my nails look okay - there is some un-evenness in my color which I'm very disappointed in considering how much I paid.  I won't be returning.
