Me love breakfast.  Me like Jamms.\n\nJamms is an okay at best breakfast\/lunch spot in Spring Valley. Tucked in strip mall. Jamms is packed on the weekend. I think the reason this little place is so popular is their Pot O' Bread. What is Pot O' Bread, let me assist you. It's fresh bread dough, placed in a little ceramic ramekin, then baked, then delivered to your table. Recently they've added flavors of the week (recent flavors: chocolate peanut butter cup, cherry cheese cake, cinnamon raisin).\n\nJamms has a wide variety of options found at any dinner. Jamms' food isn't all that special. It's on par with Denny's and IHOP. \n\nThe service is friendly, warm, and prompt. Coffee mugs, water glasses, and iced teas are never left empty. The restaurant is clean and loud. There are scattered tables and booths. On the weekends (Sat and Sun), there is looooong wait, so get here early.\n\nOn the way out, be sure to pick up a free piece of gum to get the sausage, egg, and whatever else is on your tastes buds.
