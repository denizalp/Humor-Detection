Ah, the Sherbourne Dominos. We've had such highs and lows. Crests and troughs. Hot gooey cheesy pizzas and tears. Let's examine:\n\nHIGH - Your pizza is always hot and delicious, and I'd have a hard time finding fault, compared to the other options: Pizza Pizza's crusts are super lame, and their pies always find a way to give me a stomach ache; Pizza Hut is just oily grossness; Magic Oven is bonkers overpriced; Pizziaolo has an odd quality disparity between their in-person slices and their delivery pies. Relative to the competition, Dominos' delivery pizza is consistently and reliably satisfying. \n\nLOW - The time I paid for a gift card entitling me to a free pie. They didn't have any cards in person, so they wrote it on my file, and on a receipt I got to keep. Then months later they refused to honour my free pizza because the deal was expired, even after I explained multiple times that they never gave me this information, and I never even get a proper coupon that would have displayed this important tidbit. Worst part is that they knew exactly what I was talking about - clearly ONE UNCLAIMED FREE PIZZA was written right there on my file, because when I called they were like \"Oh yeah, your free pizza. We can't give it to you.\"\n\nHIGH - It's not unique to this Sherbourne location, but I LOVE crafting my own pizza on the Dominos website, and I LOVE that it doesn't count as extra ingredients when you halve different toppings. One XL pizza = Two distinct S Pizzas. \n\nLOW - Dominos doesn't have a lot of non-protein options, which burns us as Pescetarians. We're happy there's anchovy, but we'd love to see the addition of some broccoli, spinach, basil - any number of classic pizza toppings would be most welcome. \n\nHIGH - There's nothing like Dominos' sweet web deals. Their Canadian facebook page always posts must-get 50% delivery sales.\n\nLOW - What is up with Dominoes_[dot]_ca? If I accidentally type the 'e' at work, I violate the web filter, and it's tagged \"pornography\". I don't know what's on that page, and hopefully I never will, and also hopefully I don't get fired for trying to satisfy my melted cheese needs, but anyway - it's DOMINOS without the e, thank me later.
