You will regret it. The senior male barber has extremely bad attitude. He wanted to take the customer who arrived later than me because he told his co-worker that he will lose that customer if he doesn't cut his hair first because that customer is on the lunch break. But male barber NOT knowing I understand in Catonese, and it was the female barber who argued with him and told him that I ARRIVED FIRST! This was all said in Cantonese and he is unaware that I can understand Catonese because I spoke in English when I first arrived at the shop. He even denies everything after I told him that I understand Catonese. There are similar bad reviews on the website. Feel free to google it.
