These people will steal money out of you pocket and take food off the table for your children. \n\nDr. Kim is a cheat and a fraud, he and his staff will tell you your costs are one price and then, when all is said and done, they will come back and charge you 3 times that amount. \n\nGood luck fighting with your insurance company to get it back. In the end you will have a collection agent bugging you incessantly about a bill you never agreed to pay. \n\nBetter to be toothless than deal with these crooks.
