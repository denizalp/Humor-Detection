When I was first introduced to DJK, it was described as the not-so-great-but-open-24-hours option. Screw that. I'm a fan. Granted, we do have a tendency to only go there when it's after hours and everyone else is closed.\n\nMy go-to item lately has been their Haejangguk. It's a generic term for a beef hangover soup. It isn't quite as good as when I first tried the dish at a place in Garden Grove, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. Then again, I've never had it when I've been hung over.\n\nI've also tried their Galbi Tang. Again, nowhere near as good as this one place in Seoul. But come on now. That's an unfair comparison.
