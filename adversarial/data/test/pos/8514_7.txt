So we hired them a few weeks ago for our first cleaning.  Pretty sure there are only three rules if you are in the house cleaning business: \n\n1. Actually do a good job cleaning shit.\n2. Don't break shit.\n3. Don't steal shit.\n\nSo with these guys, you have a fail on 2 out of three rules (thankfully, they didn't steal anything).  For close to $150\/hour, I expected Mrs. Doubtfire, instead, I got three tatted up college age girls in skimpy shorts and tight t-shirts.  Great if you're throwing a bachelor party, not so much if you want a clean house...
