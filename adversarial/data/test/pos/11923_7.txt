Ok, I am mad as Hell!  Here we go....I booked this hotel thru hotels.com. Prepaid for it. I was aware at check in,  that there would be the RESORT fee, of $18. That was it. The room was DUSTY.  Couldn't sit on the private patio, furniture until \"I\" cleaned it, with on of the bathroom towels. Other than that, the room was nice, grounds nice. I got the 2breakfast package. Was there for a party. I asked the front desk if the resort fee, also covered the wifi,  I was told yes.  Here's where the shit hits the fan for me. I get home and decide to check my bank acct. Why are there THREE charges from Cottonwood-----\n1. $100 deposit\n2. $39.733 Wht is this? \n3. $8.24  Wht is this?\nWtf is this for?! She said NOTHING, the entire time I was at the counter. These are pre-auth'd, HOLDS!  Which have also jacked up my frigging bank Account. I had to transfer over to cover.  Beware, Be... Aware, when you check into this place,  to ASK questions.  She didn't give me my breakfast vouchers either. We had to go to the front desk to get them, the next morning.
