The food was good. My tea though cost me $6.50. My wrap was another 15.50. By the time I got out of there with 20% tip that was a $30 lunch. I came here because I like to eat healthy. I didn't expect to leave hungry though and $30 less. My wrap was good, just not nearly the right portion. The lemon lime beet sorbet was interesting, just not my thing. My friend liked the taste of it, but not the texture. If this place adjusted it's portions and prices I'd go back.
