My girlfriend and I had been planning a trip to Las Vegas for quite some time and finally the day arrived where we were in our car and driving through the desert. I can be classified as a meticulous planner. I had everything planned from what shows we were going to see, to where we were going to stay to where we were going to eat. My girlfriend and I are HUGE fans of Steakhouses and I knew Vic & Anthony's happened to be in the lobby of the Hotel we were staying at the 'Golden Nugget.' I figured since we were driving around it only made sense to enjoy a dinner close to our Hotel this just happened to be in our Hotel. Quite honestly even if this Steakhouse was the other side of town we would of driven there, it is that good. \n\nI made our reservation for Vic & Anthony's using the Yelp feature on my phone. We arrived and from the moment we checked in with the receptionist we were treated like absolute royalty. I due honestly believe we were given the 'STAR' treatment because of the whole 'Yelp' reservation. \n\nAs other patrons were being seated on the 1st floor of the restaurant we were taken to a small 2nd level that overlooked the entire restaurant almost like you were on a balcony with curtains obstructing the view of the commoners below you=) As described on the Vic & Anthony's website 'Our Las Vegas locations offers a Private Tasting Room in an elegant setting, featuring beautiful wine country murals. The tasting room will seat up to 18 guests, and features our award-winning cuisine with and extensive wine list.' We were the only ones seated in section until just before our dessert arrived. We were also dressed the part which added with the 'Yelp' check-in was the icing on the cake. The décor was stunning. The chairs we sat in were leather with 'brass tacks,' the menus were hard\/thick leather. The music playing was everything 'Old School' Las Vegas offers you, it was a medley of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and various other artists from the day. You honestly felt like you had been transported back to the 1950's, you were literally looking at the front door of the restaurant want for Bugsy Siegel or Al Capone to walk in the front door. \n\nFrom the moment we sat down we were treated great by the staff. If you asked for anything they were on the ball and it was done. The staff brought out fresh bread with whipped butter and hard butter upon request. Our waiter 'Hector' arrived soon after our bread did and 'Hector' was one incredible waiter\/server. Hector had us laughing, smiling and made our night so much more special than it already was. I am not a drinker at all and nor is my girlfriend but we will enjoy a glass of wine every now and then. We immediately asked 'Hector' what wine pairing would go great with a Filet Mignon, Hector quickly suggested 2006 Rutherford Hill Winery Napa Valley which was amazing. As I stated above I do not see what all the hub-bub is about wine and how is pairs with a meal until this glass of wine and this meal. The wine 'Hector' suggested was fantastic. It was so good (and by 'GOOD' I mean 'GREAT' and by 'GREAT' I mean 'AMAZING.') that several days after we left Las Vegas I actually called the restaurant to get the name of the wine we drank so we could purchase it on our own. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were debating if we were going to split a Cesar Salad or also order Tomato & Mozzarella as an appetizer. We asked 'Hector' who asked what we were planning on having for dinner. We told him and he suggested we go with something lighter, we ended up just splitting a Cesar Salad 'Good call Hector.' For an entrée my girlfriend and I both ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon, my girlfriend ordered hers Medium rare, I ordered mine Medium. All of the side dishes are A' la Carte. My girlfriend and I decided to go with the Wild Mushrooms & Sea Salt French fries. \n\nOur meal was fantastic; you could literally cut through your piece of meat with a spoon if you wanted to. The steak was cooked to perfection. The edges of the steak had a char to it that complimented the Filet so well. I have been to several top end Steakhouses and nothing even comes close to Vic & Anthony's, I mean they are not even close to being in the same Ballpark. \n\nRight when my girlfriend and I thought we could not eat another bite of food 'Hector' brought the dessert menu and we decided to split a piece of cheesecake. Be advised one piece of cheesecake can easily be split between 2-3 people, so do not eat with your eyes here, order 1 piece=) We ordered out cheesecake with the blueberry dressing on the side and it was simply mind boggling it was so good. \n\nThere are several other Steakhouses I want to try in Las Vegas but it is so hard to give them a shot when you know you are going to get such great service and such good quality of food at Vic & Anthony's. I am counting the day's until I can come back here and have another meal. \n\nMy girlfriend and I wanted to thank 'Hector' and the entire staff for making our meal such a special one.
