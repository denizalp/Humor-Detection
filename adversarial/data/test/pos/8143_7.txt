Our air conditioning kicked the bucket on Wednesday so I was promptly on the phone with repair shops trying to get someone out to fix it.  It's not as unbearably hot as it was a month or so ago, but a warm, stuffy room makes it hard to sleep at night.\r\n\r\nThis place was the only shop that was able to come out the same day.  All the damn yellow-pages ads brag about same-day service but this was the only one who meant it.  \r\n\r\nThe repair guy was courteous and quick.  He reviewed everything with me before staring the work and there were no unexpected charges.  It still cost me a small fortune to get the job done, but it would have been like that anywhere.  Oh, the joys of home-ownership!  :P
