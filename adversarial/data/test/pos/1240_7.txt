Ordered a fusion pita with all the vegetables, sweet, garlic and hot sauce. The meat was flavorful, the vegetables were really fresh. The sweet sauce was a little too sweet for my preference...would be better if it was tangier I think. Their kitchen and prep station is very clean and well kept. Will go back to try other things on the menu. Oh, they only take debit and visa. No MC or AMEX.
