DO NOT TRUST THIS DEALERSHIP. My husband just spend hundreds of dollars to fly down and buy a car - phoning them MULTIPLE times including getting a call to confirm that he was ten minutes away - only to have to car sold out from under him as he was walking in the door. The salesmanship of this dealer is deplorable! And customer satisfaction must mean nothing to them. Thanks for wasting our time, $600+ in flights just to screw us over.\n\nFollow up: Now the salesman is lying to his boss about my husband offering to put money down on the car prior to flying down to purchase it! The nerve of this place.
