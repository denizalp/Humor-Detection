I've read favorable reviews and heard this was a romantic Italian restaurant, so we gave it a try. The loud, bright, open air seating wasn't what we expected, but were still game to try some good food. \n\nUpon checking in, I informed the host we had 5:15pm reservations. They didn't bother checking and just seated us. I later got an email that they canceled our reservations, for not showing up? \n\nMy date ordered a nice Pinot. The waiter stated another wine was much much more popular and she should try it instead, which she did. I ordered a house Chianti. He stated in that case I should try the 'house' favorite. Little did I know the waiter upsold us to double the price of what we'd requested. He then pressured us to add appetizers. We declined...several times. \n\nI was hoping the food would be good, but was average at best. Pasta was dry and bland. I couldn't track the waiter down for more bread. But that didn't matter as my plate was taken away before I was finished eating. \n\nUpon paying, I used a coupon for a free entree. Instead of taking the lesser $18 entree off the bill, he deducted $9. Frustrated, we ended up leaving early. I wanted to rate this establishment high, but felt conned and candidly, an evening I'd like to forget.
