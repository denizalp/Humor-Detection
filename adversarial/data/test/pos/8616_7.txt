It was good, but not as good as it is expensive. The atmosphere is fine, nothing to get excited about.\n\nThe calamari appetizer is really disappointing.The pasta and bison are great. The service is friendly and somewhat attentive, but not as polished as it should be for the  amount of money you are spending. Servers are dressed as if they are working at an inexpensive chain restaurant. Not chic or professional, which really brings the  vibe down.\n\nOverall, I would say the food is very good, but the experience is way overpriced.
