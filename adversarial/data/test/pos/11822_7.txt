I've been going here for the past 4 years and I have not encounter a single issue that turn me away. The staff are very friendly and courteous. Floor, stairs, bathroom, and dressing room are always clean and in immaculate condition. Broken\/damage machines are always fixed in less than a week. \n\nThank you for listening to your customers and give us free wifi! This helped save my data usage for music streaming so I can focus on working my bicep and getting them ready for the gun's show. Who doesn't love that?
