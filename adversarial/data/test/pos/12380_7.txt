Probably my absolute favorite restaurant on the Strip! Whenever I have friends coming into town, I always make sure to bring them to BurGR. It's the perfect Vegas restaurant for tourists! It's not too pricey, the burger is filling, and GORDON RAMSAY!\n\nIs it lame to have everyone in your party order the same thing? It's okay if you all get the Farm Burger. \n\nThe Farm Burger is a solid 5 out of 5. After trying some of the other burgers, the Farm definitely tops the list. Whoever thought of adding duck bacon into the mix is a genius! The fried egg already adds a kick to your palette but adding those bacon strips puts you to the edge. \n\nTheir Sweet Potato Fries is also pretty good! They serve it with two different sauces and sprinkle powdered sugar on top. Nice touch. \n\nNow, it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant so keep in mind that there may be a line. Try to come before the lunch\/dinner rush to get seated quickly! They're pretty good with turning their tables so even then, waiting isn't too bad. If the hostess asks you if sitting at the bar is okay, say yes! You get a good view of where the magic happens so why not?!
