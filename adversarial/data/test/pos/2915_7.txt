The fact there hasn't been a reality TV show set in a retirement home is a crime. I visit my grandma because I love her, but the stories I get in return are an amazing bonus.\n\nCanterbury is a great place for a loved one. The place is clean, staff friendly and the apartments\/rooms a very nice size.\n\nI don't think it's anyone's dream to live in a retirement home, but I'm glad my grandma has a comfortable place to call home, and an endless amount of gossip.
