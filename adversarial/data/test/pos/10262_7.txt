This place deserves so much more recognition that it receives. Personally, I never did this place justice. Instead of hitting up a place that made me feel like Baymax from Big Hero 6, I constantly hit up In-N-Out and got hungry an hour later. Looking back on my life, I've cheated on tests, got caught cheating on said tests, and have done other things probably not condoned by my neighborhood pastor. But I don't regret any of those decisions. Cornish is different, I regret not going here more.\n\n\nThe parking situation is not ideal, but the food is. Every time I went I got the cheeseburger cornish, and each time I vowed to tell my Super Bowl homies that this would be the place to come for Super Bowl meals. The servings are ginormous. I'm not a big dude, nor do I really wanna be a big dude, but I feel like Taylor Lautner circa New Moon couldn't gobble one of these down even in wolf form. \n\nI've gotta applaud the service too. I've called in beforehand, arrived 10 minutes later than my reservation, and have come during a lunch rush. Each time the food came out in a timely manner. \n\nFor a place that transplanted the camp from the Parent Trap to a restaurant in Scottsdale, it is quite impressive. When I come back to Scottsdale, this will be one of the first stops.
