They could've come up with a better name than white sauce ... lol\n\nThere's a lot of hype with Halal Guys. But don't get it twisted, this is not NYC. It's so much better in New York. \n\nIt's still good, but is a bit pricey for fast food - $12.49 + tax for a chicken and gyro platter. The portion isn't as big either. \n\nIt's not officially open until May 5th. It's a soft opening, they're still training staff. \n\nThe hot sauce is crazy spicy. It tastes like burning \nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/z0kVbXvId3A
