As per usual, I find reviewing big chains a bit trite. And, not unlike previous reviewers, I once loved this Safeway, itself an urban legend of cleanliness and customer service. Weelllllll.....\n\n.... the tide has turned. Once a spectacular bastion of people watching and friendliness in the Gayborhood has become a pit stop for all things ghetto, dirty, and angry. One of the new pharmacy staff is beyond clueless. The deli staff is completely put out by the fact you are standing there, hogging their oxygen. The pop machine by the deli is an explosion of soda water sans syrup. The poor woman working the Starbucks in the morning is always by herself (read: 10 minutes, at least, for the a.m. jolt) because her co-worker always comes in an hour late. The crusty people loitering and using the wifi look like they're just casing the joint (and\/or your car). \n\nIt's really too bad, to watch a spiffy place like this start its descent. While I will admit watching the undercover security staff tackle some dude for trying to steal vodka is entertaining, it's not the sort of thing I wish to encounter every time I pick up milk. Suffice it to say I have this Unsafeway only for emergencies now.... RIP.
