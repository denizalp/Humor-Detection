My mom and I decided to try this place after reading the great reviews my fellow Yelpers left. Unfortunately we were somewhat disappointed. \n\nThe food wasn't horrible, but neither of us could understand why they put canned vegetables on beef enchiladas, and in a fajita burrito. I'm talking about Veg-all you guys! The mix of green beans, corn, carrots and peas! I've eaten a lot of Mexican food, and I've NEVER seen this before. \n\nTo top it off the meat wasn't inside the enchilada my mom had. It was a cheese enchilada with meat, potatoes, and vegetables on top. \n\nI want to be clear here, the taste of the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't what we were expecting. The Veg-all was a total turn off. We won't be going back.
