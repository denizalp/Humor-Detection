I was excited to see this Capriotti's location being built since it's one of my favorite places to stop and have lunch. This is the first stand-alone Capriotti's in town, so no strip-mall type scene here. It's in a small parking lot that's shared with Carl's Jr and conveniently located right across the street from Aliante aka Dinosaur Park which is a plus for those wanting to grab a sandwich before heading to the park. I was happy to be their very first customer the day they opened and to thank me for being first in line I was given any meal free! I've been eating at Capriotti's since they were a smaller business long before they were bought and then opened locations all over the country, so this free meal was well deserved and absolutely much appreciated! \n\nSmall - 9 inches\nMedium - 12 inches\nLarge - 20 inches \n\nCapastrami ($8.49 for the small) - Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw. I like several of the sandwiches on Cap's menu, but the Capastrami is my favorite. I have been to this location more than once since it opened and the sandwiches has been consistent. The coleslaw tasted fresh as well the bread that is baked by a local bakery here in town. \n\nI love the size of this Cap's it's spacious inside with plenty of seating and there is a bathroom. The ordering area is by far more spacious than any of the other locations currently in town and there is a sign that indicates where to pick up to-go orders so you don't have to wait in the regular ordering line. Outside they have specially marked parking for to-go customers. Another thing about outside is the dining area that is not only spacious, but dog friendly! I have eaten inside as well placed phone orders and the employees were courteous and polite and my order was ready when promised. I have been able to earn and redeem my CAPAddicts rewards here with no problem.
