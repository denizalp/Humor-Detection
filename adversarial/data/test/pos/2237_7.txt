I found Vegas Hot! Yoga through a Groupon deal and decided to give it a shot.  Good thing it was only a one month thing, because I would not pay for regular ongoing membership at this place.  In fact, I've attended a few classes out of the whole month pass and would rather eat the cost than to come here again.  My experiences with the actual classes themselves were mixed.  The Pilates class was fine although seemed to be more advanced than I was able to handle.  The Yoga classes were way too crowded.  Some instructors were better than others, so it really depends on which class you go to.  Customer service was underwhelming to put it nicely.\n\nAll that being said, my biggest problem with this place is the pressure to TIP (if you didn't know, the signs are there to remind you to tip).  And of course, there's a tip box for each of the instructors at the exit door so don't try to sneak out without tipping.  I have no issue with gratuity when it's warranted and earned.  But I have an issue when I'm expected to tip even if I didn't feel like it was deserving.  Well, recently that expectation to tip turned into a requirement in the form of a convenient \"service fee\" surcharge for each class, which I find to be utter BS and a crappy business strategy.  If costs are too high and revenues are too low, then raise prices--I respect and can accept that more than some BS surcharges on top of what we already agreed to pay for membership, because either way I'm going to be paying more, right?  So let's call it what it is.  \n\nWhat's next?  Surcharges for heat for the hot yoga classes?  For the water provided?  For parking?  Surcharge for the surcharge?  Jokers.\n\nNamaste.
