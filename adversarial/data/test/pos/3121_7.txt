I've purchased many guns from Lone Wolf over the past few years, and I have to say that I find them absolutely wonderful: The staff is helpful, professional and polite. The prices are the lowest in town, period.\n\nThe only reason I don't rank Lone Wolf as my favorite, but only second favorite gunstore, is that they don't really do trades - if you're looking to trade, you should probably look elsewhere; their business model seems to be more of a discount\/wholesale model, used guns don't really seem to fit into that model. Other than that, I find them pretty darn perfect.  \n\nThe proprietor, Andre, is a wonderful individual of great integrity, with a big heart, and he's absolutely hilarious; if you have some time ask his opinion on the subject of marriage, and enjoy the (lenghty) response - It'll be one of the funniest things you'll ever hear:)\n\nAs with any other gunstore, you should know some basic etiquette: Don't be rude, don't be pushy, and treat the employees as you'd like to be treated; with respect.\n\nHighly recommended!
