Came on a busy Friday night and after expecting a Cheesecake Factory-like wait time of an hour or more, was treated to just a solid 25 minutes instead. It was a nice night, though, so we didn't mind waiting outside, to both go over the menu and get eaten up by mosquitoes. \n\nOrdered the beef ribs and while the sauce was really delicious, the meat itself tasted like liquid smoke and was too dry. The southwest chicken, however, was extra juicy and perfectly charred (Try it with their \"snakebite sauce\"). The french fries were excellent and quite addictive, but their coleslaw tasted like it was prepared with a cheap bottled dressing and was not very tasty. We also had lackluster service. \n\nDespite that I would come back here again. Something tells me that their appetizers and fried foods are amazing, so would like to give them another go, particularly at a time when it's not so busy in there.
