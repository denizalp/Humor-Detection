Went in for brunch this morning before bridal dress shopping. It was all our first time here and we chose it because we were able to make a reservation for the 8 of us and there was great reviews on yelp. The decor was fun and modern with a rustic touch. Lots of room and a big bar in the center. Our server was Colleen and she was amazing! She was so friendly and made sure we always had full water, bloody Mary's and coffee.\n\nThe bloody Mary's were good and they have great coffee! Server made sure to keep the cup full! All the food was delicious too. We got a little bit of everything and there was no complaints. I have been eating healthy so I got the tossed caprese salad and it was so good. The dressing was refreshing and the salad was crisp. I could of licked the plate clean. \n\nEverything was great from the server to the food. Everything was quick too which allowed us time to talk and enjoy company after eating. Everyone was talking about how we are excited to come back for lunch or dinner and bring our significant others. Highly recommend to try! Can't wait to come back! Thank you (:
