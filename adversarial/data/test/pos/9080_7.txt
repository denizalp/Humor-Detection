The atmosphere was a really cool local coffee hangout, but don't try to go here for lunch. The service was a little sketchy, and the lunch food was not good. The pizza was good until I figured out that the dough wasn't cooked all the way through. The lady serving me didn't seem to know what they had from their menu that was available.\n\nDuring the ten minutes I was in there, I had several cryptic conversations with her, two of which went something like this.\n\nMe: \"I just like to get something for lunch to go.\"\nHer: \"What?\"\nMe: \"I'd just like to get some lunch for takeout, please.\"\nHer: \"Huh? What?\"\nMe: \"To go. I want to get lunch to go.\"\nHer: \"Oh.\"\n\nAnd then with the salad...\nHer: \"What kind of salad dressing would you like?\"\nMe: \"I don't know, Italian?\"\nHer: \"Oh wait, we only ever have one kind.\"\n\nThey did have a ton of indulgent treats in their pastry case, including cookies the size of personal pizzas. All of the pastries were so unnecessarily oversized, however, that they were almost unappetizing.\n\nAlso, I might add that on their website (http:\/\/gypsybeans.com\/), they call themselves a \"bistro\" with \"the freshest seasonal ingredients prepared with worldly influences.\" In what universe is marginally cooked, mediocre pizza a good idea? The only thing they had fresh was the iceberg lettuce in my salad. What kind of bistro is this???\n\nOverall disappointing, but I'll go back to try their coffee!
