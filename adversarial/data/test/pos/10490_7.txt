Not Just Coffee South End has a new home and it's leaps and bounds better than their former spot. \n\nThey didn't move far, just across the parking lot. The new place is in the little corridor between Big Ben's and Savory Spice Shop. It's a gorgeous space. So much nicer than their old setup at the market. Caramel lattes, pour overs, and my fav seasonal the espresso mule- they're all fabulous. I'm a huge NJC and James Yoder fan. I love every one of their locations. \n\nSkip the Starbucks and Dunkins of the world and #DrinkLocal #SupportLocal!
