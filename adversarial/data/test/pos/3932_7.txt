I'm a big fan of the Brass Armadillo up on I-17 and for a long time I've wanted to check out this newer Brass Armadillo.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is just as big as the other Brass Armadillo and has about the same amount of merchandise ranging in price from extremely reasonable to \"Ha, Ha, are they nuts?\"  \n\nThey have numerous booths with treasures ranging from antique toys, vinyl records, house wares, furniture, vintage clothing, and so forth.  I saw a few things I really liked, and if I had a bigger budget I would've bought them, but being on a financial diet I placated my primal urge to spend money and just bought a $5 set of pin up doll playing cards for my husband.   (Lucky dude.)\n\nI will say that my general impression between the two stores is that the older Brass Armadillo on I-17 has a healthier inventory of antique furniture, but aside from that, the two are practically indistinguishable, so unless you are looking for furniture, if you live closer to this one then save yourself the drive to the other one.  \n\n\nPS:  Can I just add that the vendors who are selling couches and chairs who have a 'Do Not Sit' sign on the chair\/couch need to rethink that since there is NFW that most people would by a chair or a couch that they couldn't at least sit on and test out in the store.  I mean seriously, either you are selling a functional (albeit antique) chair, OR you are selling a piece of broken furniture with collapsed springs, and you just don't want anyone to find out until after they've paid for it.  Which is it?
