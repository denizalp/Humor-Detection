It's an experience alright!\n\nLove, love it here and I thank Hazel Q. for her wonderful review of downtown. I would have not ventured here without her enticing writing. Some of her reviews made it seem like she's found wonderland.\n\nI think, I might actually enjoy downtown more than I enjoy the Strip *gasp*\nYes, it's old. Yes, it's shady and there's a lot of closed business, but in my heart, downtown will always be as good as it gets in Vegas. No glitz or glamour of the Strip hotels will match the enchantment that good 'ole downtown has.
