There's an inexplicable craving that overcomes my friends when they see an upscale restaurant near SouthPark. I can't blame them; great location, valet parking and decor that makes Olive Garden a 70's mom-and-pop Italian Bistro. I could honestly care less about the superficial details of any restaurant. Atmosphere will never hide the taste of mediocre entrees. \n\nAnd that's the case with Brio. The atmosphere of the restaurant is classy, service is great and made me feel relaxed. This all dissipates when your main entrees are served. You're brought back to the reality that there was a hidden cost to this atmosphere. My order was a Chicken Parmesan with their much coveted \"Italian Herb Pasta.\" When you look at the picture of what I was served you will understand why I have the following opinions.\n\nIt looked like a novice chef beginning his first day on the line. Nothing was special about the meal at all. Herb pasta was probably the only part of the dish that had any new or exciting taste bud busting flavors and even that was short lived. I looked around at the other meals being served at my table and it was pretty much the same. Olive Garden dishes in a fancy location. For the record, Olive Garden is just as sub-par and I'm in no way promoting Olive Garden rather providing a comparison for you to visualize. I'm not a person looking for massive quantities when I come into a place like this, but I'm expecting fresh ingredients. The salad was withered and the fresh vegetables looked just the same. \n\nIf you're looking for a great dinner atmosphere, then by all means come and enjoy the place. Just remember, \"looks aren't everything.\"
