The prices are just incredible. The service is good as well. Its a generic showroom of flooring and fixtures  in the front of a Chinese operated warehouse. We are in the process of remodeling a 4500sq ft multiplex, and for 1600 dollars, we were able to get 6 2'X8' slabs of 7\/8\" granite with 6\" backsplash, four topmount sinks, two industrial stainless kitchen sinks, two kitchen faucets with spray hose and drains. Thats four bathrooms and two kitchens with granite. Done.
