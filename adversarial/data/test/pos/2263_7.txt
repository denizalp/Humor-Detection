I was in need of something greasy, something to satisfy my pit in my stomach and when Moonlite Cafe was suggested, I said why not?\n\nWalking in you are greeted by the neighborhood sports bar vibe.  Especially since I came here during the Pirates game.  The bar was lined by what looks liked regulars and Pirates fanatics.  Some high top tables lined the perimeter of the room making for getting a seat a bit of a task, but once seated we were fine.  At the time we were there, we basically did it all ourselves.  We had to go to the bar to ask for menus and back to the bar to order.  The food was delivered to the table, but by the looks of it, and with how busy it was here, they only had the bartender working at that point.  That's not to detract from the fact that we received amazing service and that bartender was one bad ass.  She gave it right back to the regulars and kept it moving.\n\nI ordered the bacon cheeseburger and he got a meatball hoagie.  I wasn't expecting much from a bar burger but I ended up surprised.  The patty was thick and juicy, cooked to your liking.  Topped with cheese and expertly cooked bacon.  Lettuce and tomato on the side so you can add if you like, nice move as to not water down the bun before diving in.  Condiments are giving to you prior so you can put as much of any condiment you like on your burger.  Each burger\/sandwich is served with house potato chips.  They were amazing as well.  I still cannot figure out what the seasoning was that topped these, but they were amazing.  As for the meatball hoagie, it was HUGE.  Three big meatballs covered in marinara and cheese.  Satisfying?  Yes.  Price point is on target as well, did not break the bank.\n\nSpecials every night of the week.  Some decent beers on tap.
