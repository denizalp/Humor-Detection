Huge disappointment.\n\nI had company in town and they are fans of the tv show, so when I mentioned that there's a Wahlburgers in Toronto, we had to do the drive into town to check it out. \nWe arrived on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm..the place was packed. We were told by the very friendly hostess that the wait time was substantial (as there were 8 of us), but we were free to order ourselves and dine upstairs. This is the option we took.\nI ordered 2 BBQ Bacon Chessebugers, 1 Tater Tots, 1 fry, 2 pops....bill came to $36.05. Seriously...$36.05.\n\nSo....it's very similar to 5 guys...you order your meal and then wait for your order. Time from ordering to the meal coming out was just over 20 minutes.  While waiting, 1 customer brought his burger back complaining it was cold. The girl behind the counter asked what was cold, the meat or the bun. He burst out laughing and said \"all of it\". She then asked the question again.....? WTH? It took over 10 minutes for a \"warm burger\" to come up. The girl working the counter kept reminding the kitchen to rush his order...and a kitchen staff member yelled back (and we could all hear it) that she'd get it \"when he was ready to give it to her\" and that he \"couldn't cook the meat any faster\". While this was going on, another customer brought her order back as it was incorrect (they didn't give her what she ordered). She had to wait at least 10 minutes to get a replacement. The manager was apologetic to both individuals and did offer free fries to both of them as compensation for the error. \n\nAnyways...on to our order.\n\nThe burger itself was very dry, which is odd because the burger meat is moist. The meat itself is tasty...and although it looks small, it is filling. The jalape√±os (there were 3 of them) were very mild, the cheese (white government cheese) melted off the top and surrounded the burger, the bacon..el cheapo.....it was 1 thin strip (couldn't even taste it)..overall, the burger was a huge let down. Fries were on the cool side...definitely not hot. Tater tots reminded me of the ones you get at Burger King for breakfast...Yikes. \n\nOverall, a huge disappointment. \n\nWon't be back.\n\nWe had friends with us (a family of 6...2 adults, 4 children)  They ordered 2 melts, fries, onion rings, 3 smahlburgers.....5 pops. Bill came to just over $60. They were shell shocked and the kids did not like the burgers at all. She also said the onion rings were odd...they're not standard fare...very little breading and she said they were pretty flavourless. Both adults said they were disappointment with the meal and that they won't go back, even if in the area.\n\nI guess the novelty of the owners is the draw...it may be enough to get people in the doors...it won't keep them coming back. \n\nFree refill on pops,.....
