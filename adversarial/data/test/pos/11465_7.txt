I've done most of my banking throughout my life with two institutions. Chase, the megacorporation from Chicago, and UW Credit Union, a non-profit organization that dominates the city of Madison. With them, I've had two vastly different banking experiences, that have illustrated to me how the pure evil embodying the American banking industry screws the consumer in a very personal way.\n\nChase: Fees for withdrawing from another bank's ATM, fee for making a deposit in coins, fee to dispute a transaction, fee to transfer money to anyone including myself, fee to set up an autopay account, fee to apply for a loan, annual fee for my credit card, fee for a notary signature, fee to mail a check, fee to check your credit score, fee to open an account, fee to close an account, fee to change up your account\/card options, fee fee fee fee fee fee fee fee fee fee.\nUWCU: Every single one of the above things is free. I can't recall every paying UWCU a fee for anything.\n\nChase: If you overdraft, Chase will intentionally avoid informing you so that they can slap you with a $35+ overdraft fee (plus automatic reporting to the credit bureaus), which will cause further fees to occur for each day it isn't paid. This essentially amounts to a tax on being poor, with exponentially growing punishment for every day you can't afford to cut out grocery money for their mafia-esque squeeze.\nUWCU: A $500 reserve line of credit that came with my original student account automatically initiates a transfer to cover any shortfall. \n\nChase: Credit Card APR for a 600s credit score - 26%\nUWCU: Credit Card APR for a 600s credit score - 9%\n\nChase: Your credit score is 350 and you never got your GED? Sure you can have a $500,000 mortgage! We'll just distribute the bad debt to Wall Street and rob the shortfall from the government anyway!\nUWCU: I have witnessed them turn away potential members whose history implies that they might end up negatively affecting the bank. If you do have bad credit they offer classes you can take as a prerequisite to joining.\n\nChase: Two ATMs and one branch exist. The two ATMs are usually broken, out of cash, or covered in garbage and spiderwebs. \nUWCU: TONS of ATMs and three branches downtown. A few branches are scattered strategically across the west side, while I advise you to avoid this bank if you live on the east side as the coverage there is weak.\n\nChase: Website forces me to go through phone or e-mail authentication to get to my account every single time I log in, wasting hours of my time in total. \nUWCU: Prompts for a simple security question.\n\nChase: Website is loaded with massive amounts of junk links leading to marketing companies, services I will never need nor afford, and page upon page upon page of horrible legalese in which fees are expertly hidden from sight. Impossible to manage my finances beyond looking at my recent history.\nUWCU: Beautiful, modern HTML5 interface that responds incredibly fast and keeps everything I need, such as a calculator and direct messaging to customer service, embedded right in the main page. I can drill down on specific purchases and track spending trends with as much ease as using Google, and it even does it for me automatically sometimes. \n\nChase: Only open while you are at work, typically 9-4.\nUWCU: Open on Saturday mornings, and until 7 on weekdays, specifically so they can cater to worker bees.\n\nChase: Fake friendliness rehearsed from a training manual, and a zealous dedication to regulations that didn't exist until your problem arose. Their ability to endlessly quote a rule that allows them to avoid doing their job rivals the toughest DMV bureaucrat you've ever dealt with.\nUWCU: Friendliest, most helpful staff I have ever dealt with. They have always gone out of their way and bent over backwards to help me with absolutely anything I have asked of them. I don't believe I've ever been told \"no, we can't do that.\"\n\nChase: The only advantage I can think of - there's a credit card rewards point system that gives me about 1 dollar for every 100 dollars I spend. \nUWCU: No bullshit rewards that I never use anyway.
