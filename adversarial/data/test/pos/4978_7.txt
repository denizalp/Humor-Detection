I LOVE this club! By far the best club I have ever been to! Great music and sexy people, what more can you ask for? :) Since this club is outdoor, it can be pretty hot in the summer time...all good though 'cuz once you're drunk, you won't even notice the difference hahaha. Some people might compare this place to XS Nightclub but I think overall I like this place better due to the chill atmosphere (just a personal preference). Oh! And another thing...this place is usually slow up until midnight or so and then it starts to pick up (well, unless if there's a famous DJ spinning then that's a whole different story!) Anyways, long story short...Surrender Nightclub is one of the hottest nightclub and you must see it to believe it! :)
