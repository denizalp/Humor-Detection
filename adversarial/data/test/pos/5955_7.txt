Do you ever find yourself saying that a Target is \"backwards\" because of the layout?  There are essentially three layouts to targets - 1) the electronics are all the way to the left when you walk in, 2) the electronics are all the way to the right when you walk in, and 3) the electronics are in the middle-back of the store.  Well this one is a #2 which is backwards to me.  Kind of weird.  They had a good selection of clearance clothes which was surprising.  A lot of the things they had were things I had never seen over at the SuperTarget @ Christown.  I guess that's what you get when you are in the suburbs of Awatukee.  Anyways, top notch Target but it is no SuperTarget.
