This place over charges. My compressor on my ac went bad.  I needed a new one. Instead of a price break down . I got a menu of prices from 4800 to 2400 to put in a new compressor . The diffrence from the 4800 come with  2 yar warrenty vs 2400 comes with 6 months warrenty.  A new compressor  only cost around 1000 and a new system is about 4000.  I dont  recommend this place if you have ac problems.  I went somewhere else and have a new compressor, fan, capacitor put in and only 1700.
