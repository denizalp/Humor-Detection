Hand's down one of my most favorite no-frills, have a good time, dont judge, and sing along spots in all of Las Vegas.\n\nBeen here twice. Don't really remember the first time, but who cares. I went last night with some friends who were in town from Los Angeles. We just kind of stumbled in. No real agenda other than to have a good time.\n\nThe moment we walked into the door, the bartender\/singer Dre was in the middle of performing a Lady Gaga number (with wig and mask to boot). It was awesome!\n\nDrinks seemed stiff (40 days till my sobriety ends), staff was attentive.\n\nThe piano player is super cool, and plays some fun songs. Bring someone here on a birthday and the birthday boy\/girl will get a very saucy and awesome serenade from Dre.  \n\nThis is definitely a very gay-friendly bar, so leave your robes and gavels at the door. Court is not in session, and you are not a judge. \n\nI like this place. I'd come back. Often. \n\nOne last note...my friends from LA LOVED this place.
