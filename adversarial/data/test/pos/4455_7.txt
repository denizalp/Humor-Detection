I'm not sure what your backyard garden tastes like, but this one's a \"spicy meatball\".  Ok.. minus the meatball.\n\nDon't let this Szechuan gem intimidate you.  The food looks much spicier than it is.  We had a few szechuan specialty dishes: spicy lamb kabobs, chili beef tongue (and yes.. it was the only tongue I got that night), and the chili chicken dish that came on a wok on top of a burner.  The longer you let it sit, the more fragrant it gets.  Now all this might sound very painful, but it really was all very flavourful without getting into the high heat threshold.  \n\nIf you're looking to sample real Szechuan, this is a great authentic place to go.  \n\nAnyways, if it was my real backyard garden.. I'd be tasting a lot of dirt.. and weed.  Insane in the brain!
