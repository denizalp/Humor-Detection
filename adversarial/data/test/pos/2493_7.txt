Finally I got to try Las Vegas #1 buffet and yes the food here beats all the other buffets combine. Bacchanal buffet is pretty pricey but if you have your total rewards card it will be only $53 for dinner. Still pricey but as a foodie I'm here to enjoy!!! After paying I was amaze from the food option available here.  Soda and coffee comes with the buffet so make sure you drink up $53 worth of soda and coffee!!  Service was amazing and they would constantly come and pick up our dirty plates.\n\nThe food-\nPersonally I thinking the best thing I had here was the seafood.The oysters here are shuck in front of your eyes and put on the buffet line constantly. The crab legs were so sweet and I really like how it's slice in half so it makes eating the legs a little bit easier. Another thing that I couldn't keep my hands off were the individual agua fresca bottles they had! I love the variation of foods from different parts of the world. When you come to this buffet you don't need to travel around the world to try great food! I'm such a huge dessert fan and this place didn't disappoint me at all. I'm a sweets kind of gal!! When I walked in I saw the huge selection of sweets that I make sure to keep enough room to try all of them! The Thai tea float and cakes were my favorite and I truly recommend you guys to try it out! Overall, this place is a must when you visit Vegas.
