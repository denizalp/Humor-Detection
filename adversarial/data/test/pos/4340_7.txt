Came here for a Zumba class with my buddy. I had never done one of these but I am pretty active so I decided to give it a try. I came with the use of a day pass, which was cool. I liked this gym a lot, plenty of equipment and what I liked best was that it wasn't all cardio. Plenty of weights, a green area to sprint, lunge, tire flip etc. Bands, kettle bells, weighted balls, free weights everything I would need. They have a package that includes small group training and classes, use of a water massage machine and tanning bed for under $40 a month. I can't speak to the services or quality of training but can say that if you are on a budget, its prob worth a try as some memberships cost more than this for simply the membership. \n\nThe class I took was a fun change of pace. I am not a big class person, but wanted to give it a try. I was sweating so that is good, however I feel this was a more mild workout than what I am used to. It was really fun and incorporated salsa, bachata, regaetton etc. I would do this again. =)
