Yo, I dig this place so hard. I discovered this  computer lounge searching for boba on the westside. This place is connected to a boba shop and allows food and beverages inside. Prices are low, and my buds and I come here often to game. We end up spending so many hours here, but it's only a few dollars per hour so pretty affordable and worth it to play multiplayer with friends. Whenever I come by, there's always plenty of open computers and seats. Computer setups are great. Chairs are comfortable. Everything works and staff is very chill and helpful.
