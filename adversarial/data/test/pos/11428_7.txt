DON'T EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER think about living in this complex. You can find much cheaper places that are probably 10x better. I lived here for about 2 years and never once did they respond to my urgent maintenance calls. My Apartment flooded twice within a few months of each other, one from a broken water main that they didn't fix for about a week and another from the kitchen sink. You can polish a turd as much as you want, it's still a turd. Then when I decided to leave they charged me about $400 in fees. About $100 of those fees I completely agreed with (I have a dog that got sick and peed in a few places). The other $300 not so much. Stay away from this place! It's in a decent area but again, a turd is a turd.
