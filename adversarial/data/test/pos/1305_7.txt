Great Indian restaurant in a very pedestrian strip mall in a very industrial area.\n\nI would not have found this great place if it were not for Yelp. \n\nService,food, and ambiance were all very good. Very authentic food at reasonable prices.\n\nIf you can find parking in their tiny lot eat here!!!
