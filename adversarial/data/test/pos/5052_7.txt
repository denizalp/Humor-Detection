This McDonald's in Viva Las Vegas is particularly nice and clean.  The parking lot is pretty easy to navigate in and out of with the busy traffic on W Charleston and the restaurant's close proximity to the freeway.\n\nGreat place to grab your morning coffee and breakfast and take a lil break and relax.  The food has consistently been quality and fresh tasting, the service very good.\n\nNice plus?  Close proximity to the hospital. Bring your own coffee and nosh when you're headed over to visit a friend in the hospital.  Bring 'me a little breakfast danish or cookie as a treat!
