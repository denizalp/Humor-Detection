Definitely a step up from a taxi...and certainly worth it NOT to have to wait in the typically super long line at the airport! \n\nClean cars, prompt and courteous service, they know all the fastest routes around town, and offer decent, competitive prices. Fantastic for both airport transfers and getting around town to non-walking locations. \n\nAsk for Bill Pappas - he's the best ! Call the main number or call direct at 714-394-0055.\n\nDon't forget to tip. ;) ...if you have any cash left...
