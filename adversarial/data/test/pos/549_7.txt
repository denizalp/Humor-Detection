What's not to like?  Good Sandwiches and good soup and friendly people!  Have stopped in a couple more times and have had great sandwiches.  The Cuban is delicious, it had dijon, swiss, capital and pork on a baguette and came with a pickle.   Also, had the crab sandwich again because it is so good.  The side of home made potato said is terrific,  some small redskins, cheese, chive and small pieces of cured ham.  Now that is cooler I had the Clam Chowder on my last visit.  Very good soup.\nThe RedWood is hard to beat for a good sandwich.
