Oh Bobby, you Sultan of Chili Oils I wanted so bad to hate your restaurant, but 'twas not to be. Instead I stumbled onto a collection of flavors that were nothing short of awe inspiring.\nDon't think twice, start with yucatan tacos they are wonderful deconstructed beauties touched off with a wonderful peanut chili (of course) BBQ sauce, these play like a Southwestern Thai fusion. Now you're ready for your main course, again don't think twice, it's the chili (of course) rubbed pork tenderloin, the recommendation will be that you get it medium rare (but you weren't thinking anything different) this life changing hunk of meat is served with a sweet potato tamale topped with a pecan butter.\nIf you're lucky Brian was your server and you are now finding yourself in a full fledged food coma, but hey it's a recession you don't need to be up all nite gambling.
