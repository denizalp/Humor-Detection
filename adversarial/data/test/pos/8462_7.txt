I chose this restaurant because it has a reasonable number of vegan options, and it was within easy walking distance from the hotel where I was staying.  I chose the teriyaki quinoa bowl for dinner and a vegan \"flan\" with berries for dessert. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! And I felt like I was eating real food, and getting real nutrition. The price is a little more than what I normally pay, but the quality of the food made it acceptable.  The only thing that would make this restaurant better in my eyes is if it was 100% vegan.  But I would definitely eat there again.
