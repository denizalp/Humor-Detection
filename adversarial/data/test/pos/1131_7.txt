Granted I had an order of $10 tortilla chips and guacamole as well as a $6 berry smoothie. The prices should have already driven me insane. But I'll look past all that because this place is situated right at the Trump pool. Apparently, there is some premium to be paid. \n\nConsidering I felt like nothing else on the menu was appetizing and I was reduced to ordering chips, I suggest a total menu overhaul is required. STAT. My order was fine. No complaints and no accolades. \n\nNow, the wait times at this place was seriously ridiculous. We were the only people ordering and all our food came out at different times. Significantly different timings. One friend's order was mixed up and another friend's smoothie was leaking all over the place and the waitress conveniently ignored the mess. \n\nI'm just going to have to say...never again.
