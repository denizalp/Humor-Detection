This place is located between 7th and 5th streets and Washington in Heritage Square. Heritage Parking garage is on 5th St. Open 10-5 daily except Thxgiving and Christmas. \n\nFirst, much of the center has the exact same exhibits (for years) if you have a membership or go there even once a year. The ones that change every so often cost extra $, and for an already-pricey place, you probably should have a membership or get a free pass from the library. Bad thing...with a membership, the emails you get reminding you that the latest exhibit's last weekend is here forgets to also remind you of the extra price involved. The kids do love the first place you come to...a water display with tons of balls. Only lacking seating for parents. \n\nSecond, the teens ( all of them) who work here couldn't be less friendly or helpful or glad to have a job...one let a not-full elevator close and ppl were waiting to get on. Who does that? Esp if you clearly have your I-work-here uniform on. Luckily one press of the elevator call button opened the door right back up.\n\nOh, and don't forget to get your parking ticket from the parking garage validated.  Not for free parking, mind you...just a discount. Unless you are lucky enough to find a metered space on the street.\nOne thing I noticed today...at 10 min til closing,  the young housekeeping ppl (3 of them) hover near the bathroom talking in spanish as if they a) have nothing else to do, b) dont want anyone else going in there so as to delay their exit.\n\nMy son gives it 3 stars and so do I.
