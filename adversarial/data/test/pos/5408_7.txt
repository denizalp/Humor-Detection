Shake Shake in DTS:\n\nYou order at the counter as soon as you walk in then they give you a pager to notify you when your order is ready. There is plenty of seating in the dining area. The dining area is mostly comprised of booths, with some chairs. The entire place appeared to be very clean.\n\nWe tried a few different menu items. The bill totaled 43.71 for the following order:\n\n2 - Shack Stack Burger - Good burger, but pretty small for the price.\n\n1 - Chicken sandwich - Pretty good chicken sandwich. I like the pepper taste in the batter. Again, small for the price.\n\n1 - Chicago Dog - I guess it is good if you like Chicago style dogs. I don't care for all of the toppings.\n\n1 - Chicken Dog - the chicken apple sausage dog was good, but I should not have told them to top it like the Chicago dog.\n\n1 - Crinkle Fries - good fries.\n\nI like the fact that the chicken served here is free range and all of the meat is natural (No hormones and no anti-biotics). I would recommend trying this place. The burgers and the chicken are worth coming back for. No more Chicago hot dogs for me.
