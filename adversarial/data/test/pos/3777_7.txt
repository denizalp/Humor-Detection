The hotel itself is a bit outdated and nothing to brag about.\nBut the casino has a lot of different gaming options and the slots are as loose as my sister. We tripled our money this trip, and we haven't done that at any other casino.\nThe poker tournament was a free offer, with free 15,000.00 in play chips and an easy way to make a litle money since only 400 people entered, and on top of it they comped our room for entering. If you play at any of thier affiliates they are very generous with the offers they send out.\nThe guys loved the cocktail waitresses, as they must hve been the closest to naked they get and the resteraunts inside the casino were amazing.
