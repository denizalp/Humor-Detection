I would look elsewhere. I had a completely different experience with Amy's Cleaning. The only positive thing is the staff and owner are friendly, but did a horrible job cleaning my home and didn't take care of my concerns.\n\nI asked to have a move-in clean, for my home was just built and their construction cleans dont get the house clean enough. I scheduled to have the crew clean all the bathrooms top to bottom, then wipe down all the cabinets throughout the entire house, clean the kitchen, dust and clean all baseboards. Keep in mind there is nothing in the house its completely empty so its an easy job. The only floors they had to do were in the bathrooms. Now the problem with new build move in's is you have to pay attention and actually work. The crew just went through the house and kind of wiped everything down, they didn't clean. I did a quick check when they were getting ready to leave and everything LOOKED clean. I was in the middle of moving boxes and that was my mistake, I should have checked better! Cleaning a new construction home everything looks clean because its new, but there is dust, dirt, caulking, grout and other random material and debris all over. You have to use elbow grease to get it all. This is what I thought I was paying for! Why would I pay a few hundred dollars for someone to wipe stuff down really quick, I can do that myself for free. After the quick walk through and giving them all a tip they left. I then put moving boxes down and checked everything again. Everything I checked was still dirty. They were not even gone 10 minutes and my hands were dirty and covered in debris. So then I walked around and checked everything else. None of the bathrooms were done fully, no one touched the laundry room, the granite in the kitchen was still a mess..... I was left standing in my home trying to figure out what they did do. Confused at what I paid for and why I even tipped them.\n\nI text the team leader and she was right down the street, so she came back to take a look at my concerns. When she got there, she was even stunned at the amount of work that was missed when I showed it to her. Out of the entire cleaning crew the pregnant lady was sent back to redo all the work the others didn't do. I felt awful! Who in their right mind would make a 7 month pregnant woman redo all the work her co-workers didn't do at 7pm at night. She needs to be at home resting. She re-did the bathrooms and the kitchen counter, but I didn't have the heart to have her do the rest of the house that was completely missed. I went ahead and sent her home and would contact the owner in the morning. I went back through what she did and she still missed a lot. You could tell the showers were not done for the crap all in the bottom of the tubs, the toilets still had caulking sitting right in them, meaning they didn't touch them, you could see dirt all over the tile.... again what did you guys do?\n I don't understand how they all missed this stuff more than once!\n\nI spoke with Amy the next morning and she was apologetic. She said that she was sorry that this was not normal for them for they have had a busy week and that they would come back out and redo the house. The problem was I had to have the house done that night for that specific reason because we were moving everything in the next day, so it all needed to be cleaned. She said construction cleans are hard because it takes a bit to get all the stuff up and get rid of the debris. Your crew just left, there is no way the dust settled that easily, the answer is they just didn't do it. I stayed up until 3am and did all the work myself to get it done. The next morning I ran my hands over everything, re-checked all bathrooms and floors, all my work and.... no issues. Amy said she would talk to her crew and adjust my bill accordingly. A few days later I got the invoice and noticed that she only credited me $50. $50 when I did all the work I asked to be done! How is this making things right? Your company didn't do any of the work I hired them for... twice! The only thing the crew did fully was wipe down the cabinets in the kitchen and dust the baseboards and lights. That's it! That minimal amount of work was not worth the few hundred dollars she charged me still. On top of the tip I gave the crew, which I am still mad at myself about. How can you justify charging a customer that much after providing all the feedback I did about the million different things her company missed.I even had pictures of the proof.\n\nI wont be using this company again. Not worth it at all. The owner sounded concerned but left me hanging. If they actually did what I hired them to do, paying the entire amount would have been no problem. But taking advantage of me like that and still charging me almost the full amount and not having to come back out and re-do your own work because I did it, is ridiculous.
