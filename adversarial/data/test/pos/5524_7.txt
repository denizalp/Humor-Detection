There are NO DOs... just DON'T... here is why...\n\n1. They DON'T sanitize their instruments... My technician brought out his tools, open to air, on a dish.  It literally LOOKED dirty--no shine, no feel of cleanliness, no sight of \"sanitizing envelope\" enclosed OR no sight of sanitizing solution in the salon.  Seriously?!\n\n2. They DON'T use new file boards... Once my pedi started, but before he started filing at my toenails, I noticed that there were \"white\" scrapes on both front and back of the file board.  Eww, GROSS!  But seriously, how much does a new file cost?  Perhaps I should bring them a fresh \"Yelp\" file.  No joke. \n\n3. They DON'T use the good products...  I usually bring my own polish--base, color, & top coat--just in case nail salons offer poor products.  I looked the brands they use for base & top coat and product names that look like they are commonly sold at cheap drug stores.  LAME. \n\n4. They DON'T do relaxing massages... My technician did more of a VIGOROUS rub, rather than a relaxing massage.  Massage chairs give better massages than my technician.  Sucks.\n\n5. They DON'T know how to paint correctly... The paint looked too thick & goopy!  Lucky for me, I had brought my own polish, so I ended up going home, removing the paint, and then re-painting it myself!  Wtf?! \n\nCONVENIENCE: * [It took 3 hours to do a regular mani & pedi... pitiful.]\nSERVICE: ** [Accepts walk-ins, but still ended up a 30-min wait on the spa chair. I started to wrinkle... had to take my feet out.]\nAMBIANCE: * [Looks clean, but looks can be deceiving.]\nPRICE:  $$  [$35 for mani & pedi]\nOVERALL:  *  [1-star, only because I have to.]\n\nNOTE TO SELF: Being cheap is not always the best way to go.  I only came here because I saw a $3 off coupon offered in the neighborhood savings booklet. Lesson learned.  FML.\n\nNuff said.
