When in Toronto, MUST GET BEAVERTAILS! I got the oreo one with vanilla icing. So delicious and a great pastry! The pastry came out quick, maybe about 3 minutes after we ordered. I know they make it immediately from scratch right after I ordered so it's fresh as heck and warm. The oreo filling tasted so good when it's melted and the pastry had a taste of cinnamon toast crunch cereal (or maybe that's just my taste bud). Beavertails is a Canadian thing, but we need one in the bay area please. Service is quick and friendly.
