*Warning* DO NOT VISIT THIS SHOP, THE GUY WHO OWNS THIS SHOP IS A PATHETIC STORYTELLER AND DISHONEST VENDOR.\nThis is the worst experience I've ever had and I'll explain.\nI came here to replace my shattered 5s screen about a month ago. Everything worked fined until a week ago my screen became dysfunctional. The screen turned extremely dim that it was impossible to operate. Occasionally I was able to knock it back to normal by tapping the upper front screen but it never lasted for than few minutes. So I suspected the problem might have something to do with the replaced screen itself or the connecter. The sensor works perfectly fine though. It can still detect the surrounding brightness so it could not be the issue.\nYesterday I visited this guy and asked him to take a look. He immediately took a new replacement screen and put it on my phone. It worked perfectly. And then he told me to give him some time to inspect the issue so I waited 40 minutes. When I came back, he informed me that it was not the replaced screen that was causing the issue, it was the sensor inside the phone. He then proceeded to say he could fix it for $70 BEFORE tax. Just so you know, I paid $100 BEFORE tax for the replacement screen AND this issue never happened before I got my screen replaced. I remembered how confident this guy was saying he could give me a year long warranty instead of a month because nothing was going to happen. OH REALLY? Of course I was going to say no to his offer. Why would I paid $170 BEFOFE tax in total at a local store, and not going to Apple Store in the first place? (Apple Store is charging $199 but they offer a 90 days warranty)\nI then asked him why was that the other new replacement screen worked fine on my phone. He acted defensively and stated that the faulty sensor was contagious and that no matter if I changed a new screen the problem would still persist. He further pointed out that he was going to charge me $50 labor fees even if he was going to give me a new screen. WHAT THE HECK? He never mentioned about a labor fee in the first place and it suddenly came out from no where. So I paid $100 before tax for a defective cheap screen and you are charging me half the list price for a new screen under the 1 month warranty period? Does that sound justifiable to any of you? As such, I told him I could not afford another $70 and asked him to put everything back together and I left. But I feel obligated to give all potential customers a heads up before they plan to visit this store. DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE. \nI also did some research on the issue I was having, apparently a lot of CHEAP AFTER-market replacement screens have such problems.. If after reading this review and you still decided to visit this store. Good luck.
