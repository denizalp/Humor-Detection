YUM! After true food kitchen, I decided that the froyoer in me needed to try this place. I have been addicted to frozen yogurt since a young age. I started with TCBY, progressed to Golden Spoon, tried Berry Good (too far away from me) and yesterday Mojo. \nAll the flavors sounded delightful! I am starting to appreciate the tartness that has taken over the frozen yogurt market. I used to be all about sweet, sweet, sweet, now I crave a little tartness from my froyo. I mixed birthday cake with cookie monster and blueberry. Next time I want to try the pistachio and the pomegranate. I filled their monster cup up 1\/2 way and my total was $3 and some change. Not bad because this place really hits the spot! Very modern decor with 3 flat screen TVs, space-age swivel chairs, red sparkly quartz\/terrazzo floors, red mosaic tiled accent wall. I am having a craving for this place right about now....
