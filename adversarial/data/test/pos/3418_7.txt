Booked 2 rooms in March for July, still couldn't be accommodated to have them connecting. Check In was a nightmare, even as an M Life rewards member. Room nice, beds comfortable, showers shower. It was an overall dry experience staying at the MGM, luckily my travel companions made the trip fun and exciting because nothing at the MGM really impressed me
