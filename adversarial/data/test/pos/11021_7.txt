I know Vegas is expensive but holy mother to betsy my cocktail was $18! For the price you'd think it would be delicious, but it was not. I only finished it because I looked at my half full glass and said to myself \"I can't leave $9 sitting there!\" I'm not cheap, I just have high expectations when I spend my money, as all of us should. I'll pay through the nose for things that are delicious!\n\nMaybe I'm over the hill (in Vegas that's past the age of 25) or maybe I've just traveled enough to know what an amazing experience should feel like. All I know is that Chateau was not where it was at on that particular evening. The layout of Chateau is long and awkward so it doesn't make for the best customer experience. Something to think about when you're designing a club people! There were the usual go-go dancer girls in costume with their gorgeous bodies and all I could think when I looked at their boobs is \"Does it hurt when you sleep on them? Or do they just feel like really thick water balloons?\" Not making fun. Honest question!\n\nBest part of the night? Check-in on your Yelp app and you can get a free cocktail ticket at the door. The girls in our party got a free ticket right away while my BF was told to wait in another to get his ticket. It seems counterintuitive that you would offer something free to excite a possible reviewer, yet you run the risk of totally annoying the reviewer with a hassle. Something to think about for the future Chateau...\n\nYelp 365 Challenge: #41\/465 (The Water Balloons)
