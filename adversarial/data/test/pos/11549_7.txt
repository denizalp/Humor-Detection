When meeting over coffee at Town Square, this is your option, and I don't love it. The space is tiny and awkward. The prices are a smidgen more than I'd like to pay. And, on my last visit it was impossible to get the WiFi working on my laptop. The staff's only explanation was that it was my Apple's fault. After investing in a drink in hopes of enjoying some time to work, I was frustrated and disappointed. While I usually enjoy their selection of iced teas, I won't order the strawberry vanilla I had on my last visit again. This location simply doesn't deliver a solid coffee shop experience. It's pricey, cramped and a technology failure for me.
