This place is fun and I get the theme is really fatty food, but I couldn't eat anything on the menu. I don't eat meat and they wouldn't make me a grilled cheese even if I paid the same price as a burger. I ended up getting the onion rings fried in lard, only cause I was starving! \n\nFun place though and I would recommend for meat eaters cause the atmosphere is cool.
