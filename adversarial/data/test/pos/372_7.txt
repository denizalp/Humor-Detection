Absolutely the WORST place I've been to for nails! I pulled out one dollar bills (because I personally just like having ones) this person checking me out calls ME A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD A STRIPPER and that I'm not going to get anywhere with 1's???? 2+2=7, it doesn't add up. Never going here again, what kind of customer service is that? I'd rather have my nails looking horrible with someone who makes me laugh and feel comfortable than someone who is horrible with speaking to customers and does semi-good with my nails.\n\nTo reply to Quoc D's disrespectful comment down there! First, I have manners. Telling the TRUTH about someone being rude is NOT rude AT ALL. Calling someone a stripper or something remotely close to it is UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE, and is a horrible employee that needs to get checked. My friends, along side by me, said you guys were highly disrespectful and were extremely rude the whole time. I'm just the one who actually said something, but that day you lost three customers and I got my money back so I am okay and I'm also okay knowing I was NOT rude by stating facts about that woman and this company. I can involve the cops easily for you guys harassing a minor.\n\nP.S.- Please learn how to spell correctly, and also him saying \"What're you a stripper?\" Most definitely means that he called me a stripper. Nonetheless, once again, I'm just glad I got my money back and you guys lost 3 customers.
