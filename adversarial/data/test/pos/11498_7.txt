Rude barstaff, drunk customers, great for the regulars not so good for anyone else. The liquor board should shut this place down, they don't seem to realize there are serving laws in this province and when a drunken regular starts arguing with a sober patron it's the barstaffs job to remove the drunk from the premises regardless of how good of a friend they are. It's unfortunate places like this are able to fly under the radar. I guess we'll have to wait till one of these patron kills someone with their vehicle before something is done. Be careful when driving near this place, it might be you.
