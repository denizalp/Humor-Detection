Let me tell you about Citizen Pie. It's fast. It's fresh. It's worth the price. The crust was so light and fluffy that I felt as if I was eating a cloud from the heavens themselves. I got a calzone which was as big as my head. And delicious. The staff were great too. Everything about this place is great and I am so pumped it exists in Ohio City now.
