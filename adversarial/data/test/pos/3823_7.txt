I like the energetic atmosphere. The drinks are good and reasonably priced. Some things I tried were down right CLEVER and other things I tried I was left underwhelmed with. \n\nThe Caesar Salad is a delicate symphony of classic infused with the most delicate of Asian Flavors and even though I only had a small bite of it I thought it was delightful. I was expecting the Szechuan Crouton to be something special either spicy or full of flavor but it was just a hard lump of something I couldn't determine.\n\nThe Roast Corn Dumplings were another one of the very goods. The dumplings were tender and dressed with finely cut scallions. The Tomato Broth was multi-dimential with changing flavors of sofrito, ginger and Thai Basil with a building but not too hot heat.\n\nI thought both appetizers were very good and will forget about the Szechuan Croutons.\n\nI had the Salmon Bibimpap. I do note I am more sensitive than most people about smoke flavor and some smoke flavors are hard for me to tolerate. My first bite of the salmon was delicious with a charcoal kind of flavor that I enjoy but most of the salmon had a strong smoke flavor that took over. My vegetables were fresh and they gave me lots of brown rice. I didn't really taste any Korean Chili Glaze in my dish so I don't know if it had any or not. People who don't mind a smokey taste will like this dish.\n\nMy husband had the Kung Pao Fried Chicken. He was a little disappointed because the chicken was very soft and in his words \"squishy\" He was also disappointed because the spice and flavor level was \"Old White People from Sun City\".\n\nI thought the Tea-a-misu was exactly the way it was described on the menu.\n\nThe Roasted Peach Fritters were really Donuts with a little bit of Peach in them. They were made fresh to order and were tasty with the Cream Cheese Dip.\n\nService was friendly but a little odd.\n\n My husband expressed his opinions to the management about the food. Our bill arrives and one dinner was removed. My husband pulled out his card to pay and tells the waitress it wasn't necessary to remove his dinner.\n\n So she comes back and ADDS the dinner back on.\n\nThat was odd wasn't it?\n\nGood Drinks and Good Appetizers in an energetic atmosphere. I note you have to valet park behind the building to dine here.
