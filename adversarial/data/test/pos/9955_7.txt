First let's clarify something:\n\nRating for restaurants in Madison-Verona area: 3\/5\n\nRating for restaurants in Verona area: 4\/5\n\nMy husband and I went here on a Friday night and it was packed. The decor was a grey, cool winter palette with nice a fairly nice ambiance. Lots of wood tones scattered throughout which I approved of but my husband wasn't feeling 'inspired' by it. \n\nPros:\n+ wine list (by glass) is more extensive then would have previously expected\n\n+ friendly and accommodating staff\n+ nice ambiance\n\n+ fish fry - my husband ordered the fish fry and really enjoyed it. The cod was fried very well although the fried were underwhelming \n\n + fish tacos - i got these and thought they were delightful. Spicy with a really flavorful aioli but kept light by the addition of the cabbage. Would recommend trying this\n\nCons:\n+ bruschetta trio appetizer - the main sin was that the bread was a soft loaf that was not toasted. Without the bread being toasted, the whole thing had too soft\/soggy texture. There was 1 from the trio that had wine poached apples on top of goat cheese which we weren't fans of. Mainly due to texture but also due to taste. The goat cheese was too strong and the apple wasn't crisp enough to balance it out.\n\n+ side salad - underwhelming and boring. Had a maple, apple cider vinaigrette which was an interesting dressing but the salad wasn't really made for that type of dressing (store bought, shredded cheddar cheese topping). They did make their own croutons (with the same bread used in the bruschetta) and it was OK but the texture was a bit off and I'm most certain they tossed it in bacon fat. Again, this isn't bad but the was the salad was composed didn't work with the dressing or croutons. \n\n+ table bussing - we finished our appetizers and the bus person came over and took all of our silverware off of the table. Both of our knives, and our forks(luckily I was left with a fork so I could eat my salad). We were not offered new silverware and had a hard time finding our waitress to ask. It should also be noted that neither of us had knives when eating our main dish (although I had tacos so I used my hands)\n\n+ mystery server - some random person delivered our food but it was a bit awkward. The person sort of snuck up behind, didn't say anything, dropped our plates, and practically ran off. It was rather funny but definitely awkward.\n\n+ menu size - this menu was HUGE. There were so many options that my husband and I couldn't figure out what the restaurants 'identity' was. There were like 20 appetizer options (one of which was a burger?..not a slider...but a burger?)\n\nOverall thoughts: food is good for the Verona area. Pricing is fair. My biggest criticism would be for the staff to get a little more training on how to appropriate handle table maintenance and etiquette ( but this is really just my push for this place to set the bar higher ). Menu is way too big! Figure out your identity and simplify the menu. And finally... please toast your bread for the bruschetta (or use a baguette instead of a soft loaf)
