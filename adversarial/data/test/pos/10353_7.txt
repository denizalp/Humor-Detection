Cozy, caramel colored themed lounge. Good place to get a drink or two with some friends. Music and drinks were pretty good. There was no cover for us and we got 2 for 1 drinks that night. We were all clubbed out from the 3 previous days and wanted to just relax and mingle with drinks. We decided on Caramel because we happened to be at the Bellagio. \n\nWe ordered numerous drinks and got a nice buzz, hung out, danced and just talked about the Las Vegas trip. Too bad for me we left at 3 AM because I went to the poker room right after and lost a $1200 pot! LOL! \n\nI can see myself coming back if I'm around. I think Blush is a nicer lounge though.
