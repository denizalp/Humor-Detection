Sorry as this review is a little on the late side. We must of driven by Nacho Daddy a million of times from Downtown Fremont Street to the strip and never even thought about stopping in until one morning when we were looking for something to eat and turned to Yelp for suggestions.  At that time they were running a promotion for a free house margarita when you check in and bam that caught our eyes.  In a city where liquor prices are up there and to get a free margarita just for checking in???  We had to at least check in and get our free margarita. We found street parking right there on 4th Street. \n\nWe walk in and this place looks like a legit Mexican biker bar straight out of the movies and we liked it. After getting seated we were looking through the menu and our waitress came to take our orders so we showed her our check in for margarita and she smiled like she never saw that before and told us that it will take a little while as they are short handed at the bar. Short handed was right.  Our waitress was also the bartender, server and bus person. So yes our drinks took awhile. But when they came, it came in these huge glasses so we thought that no way they could taste good but one sip and we knew it was worth the wait. It was one of the bigger and best tasting margaritas we ever tasted. While they don't have that promotion when you check in, you can go to their Yelp page and you can click the 1 free margarita to be sent to your phone.  Yes sometimes you have to work for what you want and trust me, it's worth the effort to get it. Hey it's free and good and huge.\n\nOn to the food. My nephew got the Breakfast Burrito ($10.95). You have a choice of sausage or bacon. Of course scrambled eggs, melted cheese, hash browns and ranchero sauce. It came with it's own house made chips and salsa.  He couldn't contain himself as he dug into this behemoth of a burrito. I asked him how did he like it?  All he could do was nod his head and give and give a thumbs up. \n\nMy better half got their Steak Omelet ($13.95 +$2 for egg white) and was happy to hear that they could make it with all egg whites for an extra charge. The steak was a nicely marinated, with pico de Gallo and melted jack and cheddar cheese. It was came with salsa and hash browns. \n\nFor myself and yes I shared, I got their Supreme Tostada Nachos ($17.50). A big pile of nachos that came with seasoned ground beef, they got every cheese in the house and sprinkled it all on.  Refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, you name it and it was on there. \n\nIt was only 9:45 am and we were stuffed and pre-gamed all in one sitting.  Great chill atmosphere, good service considering they were short handed, great food and drinks.  Nacho Daddy, we will come back and conquer your delicious food and drinks and we will say who's your daddy!\n\nTheir hours:\nSunday - Wednesday 8am - 2am\nThursday - Saturday  8am - 3am
