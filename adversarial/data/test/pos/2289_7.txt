Steelers, you did not let us down. I have nothing but love for this team, this city, and its fans. I waited a full day to write this so that it wouldn't sound too obsessed.\n\nBut, that's 6 times, baby! You can't fuck with that. That's the best EVER.\n\nI want to thank my Mom and my Dad, for having me on the western side of the great state of Pennsylvania. I also want to thank them for being the best and least annoying people to watch football with.\n\nI want to thank Mom specifically for giving me a general ADHD-proof explanation of what the hell is going on during a football game. I'd never be able to watch football if it weren't for her. I also want to thank her for freaking out and screaming the way I did when #92 intercepted the football and ran it 100 yards into the Pittsburgh end zone. I'd also like to thank her for not getting mad when I started jumping on her furniture when #10 made a game-winning catch with 2:4x left to go in the 4th. I also want to thank her for making Dad and me delicious chili and a Steelers cake so that we wouldn't get ill from all the excitement.\n\nI want to thank Dad specifically for his love of the game and for explaining its intricacies to me [but only after Mom has had her say first.] I also want to thank Dad for laughing with Mom and I rather than at Mom and I. \n\nI want to thank the iron and steel workers who have made the three rivers region what it is and for inspiring the best football team in the NFL and for being its best fans. For once, the working class comes out ahead!\n\nI want to thank #43 Troy Palomalu for intercepting and scoring at 40 yards, thus sealing a Steeler victory during the AFC Championship vs. the Ravens. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IdlQ28cqgr8\n\nI want to thank our even-tempered head coach Mike Tomlin for guiding our boys to a 2009 Super Bowl victory.\n\nI want to thank #92 James Harrison, NFL.com Defensive Player of the Year, for making an unforgettable interception in the Cardinals' end zone and running it 100 yards into the Steelers' end zone! Damn, bitches! http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CyeAypl7xkI\n\nI want to thank Cardinal #11 Steve Breaston for blocking fellow Cardinal #15 Larry Fitzgerald during our record setting 100 yard run. LOL! http:\/\/images.ocregister.com\/newsimages\/2009\/02\/01\/b78465123z120090201212121000gflgcrqt1_lg.jpg\n\nI want to thank #10 Santonio Holmes for making an impossible catch to win the Super Bowl. You left us breathless when your feet touched the end zone. Love. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_ijHpXrSgQQ\n\nI want to thank the Cardinals for an unexpectedly good game. (LOL-I accidentally wrote Ravens at first!)\n\nI want to thank Liz for rooting for the Steelers. I guess I'll thank Scott for going for the Cardinals, so I had a face to rub our victory into. \n\nGo Pittsburgh! I love the Steelers! XOXO! S.W.A.K.
