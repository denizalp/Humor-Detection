This reminds me of a City Walk, Hollywood\/Highland or a Downtown Disney.  Gentrified restaurant choices, movie theatre, area for live music, etc..\nThe people milling around seemed a bit off to my husband and I. \nWe wondered if there was a chubby prostitute convention in town. \nPlus, alot of people smoking and getting rowdy in the later hours. It was fine for a place to grab a bite and a movie, because we were staying across the street at the Ritz. But I would not pick it as a destination.
