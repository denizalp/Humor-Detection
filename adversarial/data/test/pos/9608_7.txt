Today at 1pm the best thing ever happened. A second Northwood location, Northern Belle, opened near my house. \n\nI used to live near Northwood and frequented it far too often. I had my first coffee of the day there, I used their wifi for hours on end (some work, some wikipedia spiraling) and then would transition into night with a cocktail around 5pm. I can't fucking wait to start to do the exact same thing here. \n\nSame candlelit-wooden vibe, incredibly curated cockatil list and amusing cast of characters. This time with a patio a stone's throw to Trinity Bellwoods. A goddamn delight.
