To make it short and sweet, I was not impressed. Cost me an arm and a leg to get some ramen. I wouldn't be complaining if it was worth it, but it was too bland for my tastes. I had to keep adding soy sauce, chili paste, & Siracha to make it taste like something. Won't be coming back. The restaurant has a nice feel to it though.
