Okay, it has taken me a long time to write this review because I am feeling very guilty.  \n\nWhen I walked out of O.H.S.O. a bald guy by the door on a computer asked us how our meal was, truly showing how much he cared about the bar.  I lied.  I told him it was great and I walked out.  I feel SO GUILTY. I wish I had said something to him. \n\nSo, here it is...\n\nA letter to the management:\n\nWe came to O.H.S.O. based on friend's recommendations and reviews I kept seeing in Phoenix magazine. I really wanted to LOVE this place. We even came for our 4th anniversary!!!!  I, unfortunately, do not think we will be back.\n\nWe ordered the Prosciutto flatbread and the Brisket Burger along with 2 beers, and 3 tester beers throughout the meal (Sonoran white chocolate, luge be chocolate milk, ohso orange nitro, double jack, hop box imperial ipa).  Sonoran and Nitro were good, the Chocolate milk was meh and the Jack and Imperial were yummy (says the boyfriend).\n\nThe Prosciutto flatbread sounded amazing.  Prosciutto, broccolini, garlic pomodoro, you can't go wrong!!! It did.  The flatbread came out as my meal and it looked like a meal for a lumberjack.  It was packed with a chunky meat and was impossible to look hot eating this thing, during our anniversary dinner.  Of course I expected shaved prosciutto, like probably 99% of the customers expect.  I saw this thick cut sliced prosciutto that looked like and tasted like canadian bacon.  I get that O.H.S.O. wanted to go different; this was different, but not better.  It would be great if it was regular thinly sliced prosciutto, so you could savor ALL the flavors at once instead of feeling like your eating meat and bread.  This was clearly a dish that was made by men in a kitchen. Extra meat does not always mean better, and making it so hefty negates a huge number of women from wanting to order it.  If the food is too cumbersome, I don't want to eat it.  Especially on my anniversary.\n\nNext the Brisket burger... ::sigh:: It was just a disappointment.  We knew it was stupid to order brisket after we had the best brisket ever in New Orleans for the holidays.  But my boyfriend was craving it so he ordered it.  Again, someone that owns the place, or someone in the kitchen decided that regular brisket was not good enough.  So pulled brisket was apparently the way to go.  No dude. Brisket means sliced with that pink smoke ring.  Pulled brisket shows people that the kitchen doesn't know that or does not have the smoke ring and wants to rip the meat apart so you don't see it.  Plus, it was bathing, NAY soaking in the tub of sauce which just intensifies the idea that there is no confidence in the meat or the smoking of the meat, so why not mask it in sauce.  That was almost like when your mom would make a meal as a kid, and she'd mess up and it would be bad, so she'd just whip out the ketchup and squirt it on.  I had previously repressed that memory of my mother, until O.H.S.O.  Once again, another man meal.  Way too heavy, and not much care taken to prep.  \n\nI feel bad, because someone put amazing flavors together in their head.  But not being confident in the flavors allowed someone to try to tweak something in each plate that was supposed to be awesome and just makes the whole meal fail.  Go back to basics and then test stuff one at a time.  I would NEVER go back for the food, ever, even though the menu looks amazing.\n\nBring a trained chef or a woman in to show you what's up, and show you that each food item is WAYYY too heavy. I even watched a salad go by that would dwarf Elaine's \"Big Salad\", it was a beast.  It's not even like we're pansy eaters too. We're both 6 foot+ and can put away footlong subs in one sitting. But when going to O.H.S.O. I don't want to feel like I just put away a footlong sub. Plus, food that heavy decreases beer sales because people get too full too quickly. \n\nI really am rooting for this place and I want it to succeed.  But some menu revamping needs to happen. 52% of the population is women and the food is way too heavy for us.  \n\nGreat look, great interior, great decor on the walls, I love seeing the tanks and people making beer to the side.  If I opened my own bar I would have done the SAME THING, same look, same feel. Except the menu.  I will come back if the menu is revamped.  Otherwise, we'll save the trek from Laveen.
