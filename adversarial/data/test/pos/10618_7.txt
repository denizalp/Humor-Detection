Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.
