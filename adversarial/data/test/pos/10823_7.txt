While celebrating what I'm sure was my 29th or 39th birthday last weekend, we spent two separate nights in the Cosmo having drinks or dinner and although the outside seems cold and hard, I was pleasantly surprised at the class and warmth inside. I suggest that if you're in town, you spend some time there and relax in the chandelier bar or try some of the restaurants--- great food and memorable service! I would recommend this Hotel\/Casino resort to anyone looking to have a fun time and be surrounded by people looking to enjoy themselves.
