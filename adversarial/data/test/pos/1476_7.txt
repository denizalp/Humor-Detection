Seriously, a three-star average?  This place is great!  But whatever your opinion, you can't deny that it is a unique attraction, not just in Toronto, but anywhere that I've ever heard of.\n\nI'll let you read elsewhere about the rise and fall of Sir Henry Pellatt and the intriguing saga of his dream home.  A tour through this incredible building and its grounds is a delight, especially while imagining it in context of the lives of those who lived, worked, and visited here in the early twentieth century.\n\nAdmission includes a personal audio-tour device to let you roam through on your own, which is the perfect setup for me.  I have the freedom to move at my own pace, but all of the information available from which to sample.\n\nHighlights for me included:  the Great Hall, the Library, the Conservatory, Sir Henry's Study and its secret passageways, Sir Henry's Bathroom, Lady Pellatt's Suite, the towers, the Smoking Room, the basement, the tunnel, and the grounds.  I probably would have enjoyed more the Queen's Own Rifles regimental museum, but by then I was beginning to get \"museum fatigue\" and I just couldn't devote the mental energy and attention that it deserved.  However, it does contain a rich slice of modern military history.\n\nFun note:  Apparently over a dozen mainstream movies have filmed scenes in the castle, including Cocktail, The Tuxedo, X-Men, Skulls, and The Pacifier.  Hey, I said \"mainstream\" not \"classic.\"
