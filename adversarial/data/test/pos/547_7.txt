I am AMAZED and AGOG that this is BeachMac's first review! MacPeeps in the MacBeach, check this place out!\n\nStaff are wonderful - friendly, funny, and - wow - they know Macs. Both of the employees I met were young males (appropriately and adorably geeky), and were absolutely lovely. They were patient with my ignorance (this is my very first Mac, and it's a hand-me-down), and listened to every single thing I said. LOVE THAT.\n\nIt's a cute little corner shop on East Queen East (does anyone else say that?) between Woodbine & Victoria Park. It's small, but efficient. Spacious for its \"front-of-house\" needs. They sell everything Mac-ish... Sometimes (if the door at the rear swings open) you can catch a glimpse of the MacFairies working at the back... it's all very secret and special.\n\nStreet parking, and there are always spots available (SCORE!)\n\nI took in two MacBooks - one mine and one for a friend. The friend needed upgrades to everything, and I had an odd problem with CAPSLOCK and Shift.\n\nEveryone on the Apple Support online forums said my issue was related to an operating system upgrade bug... NOPE! It was just the keyboard and housing needing to be replaced.\n\nThey send an email every day it's in the shop to let you know what's going on, as well as an email when it's ready!\n\nMy MacBook was ready in two days, the other in five. Pretty darn MacAwesome.\n\nAnd - LISTEN - when they hand you a bill from a computer bought  in 2006 with a $0 bill... I mean, just come on. I love it.
