Nothing to write home about. It's your typical low budget buffet. I wasn't expecting to see an elaborate spread so I really didn't have high expectations. I should've lowered my \"low\" expectation. The reviews are mixed so we must've picked an off day to eat dinner here. \n\nNothing really stood out expect for the pizza alfredo which the pizza guy hand tosses and makes from scratch. Everything else was just blah. The roast beef was dry and tasteless. When the guy served it me, he practically flung it on my plate and looked angry. When I asked for the au jour sauce, he acted like it was inconveniencing him. I was handing him the bowl to put the sauce in but he ignored the bowl, grabbed my plate and dumped the sauce all over my food! Literally. I mean he didn't just put it on the meat, he put it all over my whole plate. Sheesh, who does that? My plate and the rest of my food was drenched. \n\nThe fried chicken which was now drenched in that sauce was also tasteless. The mashed potatoes were good, not fantastic but good and yes they were drenched in that dumb sauce too. Like I mentioned the pizza alfredo was really good. Even though it was drenched in that stupid sauce, I really liked it. In fact that's all I ate after that.\n\nAs for deserts. it looked very good but looks can deceive. The pastry guy was putting out new deserts and me being one who likes to talk to anyone (annoying right) told him the deserts looked awesome and asked him if they were made in house. He said they weren't and that they were bought at a store! LOLOLOLOLOLZ! OEM! I would never admit that. I did have a good laugh though. The deserts were dry. Nothing special. \n\nWill I go back here? Probably not, oh wait, we did go back for breakfast which was pretty good. You can order your eggs how ever you want them. I ordered over medium and asked for 1 egg but the guy misunderstood me and made two. Not a biggie, but the funny thing is, he kept dumping the eggs and making new ones because he didn't like the way they had turned out. I kept telling him it was ok, but I guess he was a bit of a perfectionist...lol. Gotta love Vegas.
