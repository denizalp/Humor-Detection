I have been wanting to try out Apache for the longest time, Today I finally stopped by.. Had an Apache Burger with fries and small drink.. $14\nA little on the high side for what you actually get burger and fries were decent but really dont come close to Five Guys or Burger Priest.\nWill I go back? Maybe if in the area.\nService was quick and efficient !
