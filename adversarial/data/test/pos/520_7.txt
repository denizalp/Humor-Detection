Idk how I found this place to bookmark it,  but it was a good find. I came in about 1130pm and we ordered fried pickles, deviled eggs, buffalo wings, and a burger. The fried pickles & deviled eggs were on the happy hour menu at a discounted price. Very good deal!!!! Fried pickles were great. Deviled eggs, ok, but I've had better. He said his wings were good, but he wasnt happy that he asked for all flats and got 2 flats only. Plus he said he could've used more sauce. My burger was requested well done & to me it was medium maybe. It was a good burger, but would've been great if prepared as requested! Overall we enjoyed our meal. My drink was good too. I'll go back to try breakfast since they're 24\/7 hours. Service was pretty good too.
