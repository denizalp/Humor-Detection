Hands down one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants I have been to her in Charlotte. I've came here a handful of times and every time has been great. The service is fast and the sushi is fresh. If you're not familiar with Mr. Tokyo it's an AYCE hibachi and sushi restaurant. I can't vouch for the hibachi as I've never had it, but their sushi is pretty bomb. And the best part is that it's NOT a buffet. The sushi is made fresh and made to order. And for $18 a person for dinner you really can't beat it.\n\nFor starters I always get a spring roll and the Mr. Tokyo bowl, which is limited one per person. The Mr. Tokya bowl is spicy crab goodness wrapped in salmon and it's dynamite! It's a must order every time. \n\nMy husband and I usually split 5 speciality rolls (woof I know) here and our favorites are the Panther roll (which I didn't see on the menu last time- sadness) and the Snow White roll. The Sweet Heat roll is also a personal favorite with avocado and spicy tuna. \n\nSince the release of the Charlotte Agenda article on this place they have been packed so make sure you come ready to wait on the weekends. However, their bar (sits 4) is open on a first come- first served basis. We sat up there once and it was fine- better than waiting an hour.
