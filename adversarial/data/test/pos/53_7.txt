Came back a second time just to see if my first experience was just a fluke. Im happy to report that this time around I was blown away.\n\nWe ordered the same thing as last time which was a medium thin pepperoni and a small deep dish special. Unlike our last experience, this time around the deep dish had plenty of onions, mushrooms, peppers, and sausages. Of course the amount of mozzarella cheese was insane! The thin crust gave you a mouth full of pepperoni in every bite. Yes, you have to wait a while for the any deep dish order but there are some things that are worth the wait and this is one of them.\n\nWe even tried the house salad and the cheesy garlic bread. Both were excellent starting appetizers to get your palette started. Afterwards we all shared a chocolate cake which lasted all of 50 seconds. Should we have ordered our own? No. Although my kids would have loved it, I have to put my foot down sometime. Just because you can doesnt mean you should.\n\nOur server Goose did everything that was expected of a good server and then some. Even the manager Nick stopped by several times to make sure everything was ok.\n\nIn closing, most people complain that they dont get enough cheese on their pizza. Here you just might complain that its too much and thats not necessarily a bad thing. As a local, I usually try to stay away from the strip for obvious reasons but Giordano's is only one of the select few that me and the fam know that its worth going to.\n\nYelp 2017 Review #12\n645 overall
