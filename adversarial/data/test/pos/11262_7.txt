Diarrhea city brehs.\n\nSo I swore to never eat here again. When I first moved to Vegas 3 years ago we came and ate here. I got a really upset stomach and was on the pot for quite a while after. Fast forward a year and I go to the one that used to be opened on Charleston and Durango; everything was fine, that place closed so now we go to the one on Cheyenne. Never had any problems with those 2 locations, but here, hell no. \n\nThe customer service is really great and the place is not too gross, but its def huge! \n\nIf you are constipated and need to release the demons, COME HERE!\n\nYAY?
