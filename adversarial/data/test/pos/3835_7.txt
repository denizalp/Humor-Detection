Essence, you are lovely. If House of Tricks and the Farm at South Mountain had a baby and sent it to the Cordon Blue Cooking school, it would be you. \n\nYou are empty at 11am on a Tuesday, so I had you all to myself. Delightful. The staff was displaying the desserts, to their utmost...a little like window dressing at Macys. I ordered something safe. I ordered quiche lorraine and it was perfect. Just the right pastry with a perfect custard. Nice bit of spinach and ham.  Not heavy, not runny, not gooey, perfect does describe it. It came with a salad that was relatively pedestrian, didn't underwhelm, didn't overwhelm. Fresh greens, baby spinach in a light vinaigrette. Topped everything off with an iced tea and sat in relative silence with a bit of African drums groovin' in the background. I stopped by to check out the dessert display and could not pass up the macaroons. You know this, I don't need to tell you. They are divine. You are lovely and thank you for such a lovely meal.
