BEST garlic chicken I've ever had! My second time coming to this food truck and I fall more and more in love with it. My excitement to find out that they had a Yelp page was real. The bento is my go to. Comes with their signature crispy garlic chicken, spam, sausage, fried saimin and white rice. Seriously so delicious!!!!!! They have an Instagram account you can follow, to know where they're going to be located. Now stop reading this and go find this truck!
