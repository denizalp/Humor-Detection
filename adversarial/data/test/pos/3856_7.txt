Worst customer service ever!!! My husband and I waited 10 minutes for a server and nothing. While we were waiting 5 different servers walked past our table, 2 of which looked at us, smiled, and continued walking. It wasnt like the place was busy, there were 4 other tables in the entire restaurant. We were looking forward to trying their food but that did won't be happening. We ended up leaving and going to Buffalo Wild Wings. The place was packed with tables and we still received faster service.
