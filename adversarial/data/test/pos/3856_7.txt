When our office got their menu showing delivery we all were happy because of the limited places that deliver in Concord.. The menu showed make your own salad.  What a great lunch idea.. I ordered lettuce, egg, oranges, blue cheese, mushroom, jalape√±o, olives, cucumber, tomato, and corn blend no dressing.  When they delivered I got lettuce, cucumber, mushrooms, oranges, tomato, Tortilla Chips, Chia seeds and dressing..  Clearly they made and brought us the wrong salad.. We called to let them know and the response from the owner was \"We have a birthday party and can't do anything about it, forgive us\".   REALLY???  Obviously they do not appreciate their customers..  If you are hungry for WHAT EVER the kitchen wants to serve you and owners and don't care give them a try..
