Solid, convenient market. Lots of selection, reasonable prices.\n\nStopped in to grab breakfast. Lo and behold were a selection of banh mi. I spotted two bins marked identically (Vietnamese pork sandwiches), except one had \"spy\" written. No clue what that meant, so I grabbed one (I wouldn't last long on Survivor), and an Aloe drink (decided against beer). Paid about C$4, in cash.\n\nThe drink was good, and the sandwich was fine for what it was, where it was. The sheen on the sandwich freaked me out when I first unwrapped it, but it ended up being satisfying overall, with pickles, cold cuts, and jalapenos.
