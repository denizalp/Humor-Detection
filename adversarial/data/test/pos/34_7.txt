Damnnnnn! The food here is delicious. If you haven't noticed, I've been on a bit of an ital food bender lately. How could I not with all these awesome places opening up? There's now 2 places in the market - Vital Life and Veggie D'light, One Love at Bathurst-Bloor and V's Vegan Caribbean on the west side and Ital Vital in Scarborough.\n\nGet all the things for $15, 4 of the things for $12 or a lot of one thing $5. We went for one all, one 4 and we'e very satisfied. \n\nThey also had fresh young chilled coconuts which was delightful for polishing off the meal.\n\nThe vegan mac n' cheese bake was perfection and we both loved the 2 types of TVP curry, the callaloo, plantains and beans. \n\nGet yourself some ital food and lively up yourself!
