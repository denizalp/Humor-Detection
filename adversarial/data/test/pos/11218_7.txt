I have a list of places that I want teleported to Austin. This is one of those places. \n\nThe inside is just gorgeous -- clean and fresh but still warm and welcoming. Expect to be amazed by the incredible wood fired oven, catered to sweetly by the nicest, most efficient servers on the planet and to encounter the best tomatoes flown fresh from Italy every other day. This place is serious y'all. \n\nEvery bit of our meal was delightful. We oohed and aahed and exclaimed and ate. And ate. And ate. The meatballs, the caprese, the arancini can hold their own  among the allure of a big pizza pie. A hats off\/high five\/big hug to Stefano and crew for making a perfect Italian haven in the heart of Phoenix.
