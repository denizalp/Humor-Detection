Well I have read nothing but great reviews and I am currently sitting in the docs office waiting to be seen after being here for 1hr 45 mins after my scheduled appointment. The staff up front is lazy and they are not proactive at all. I set there listening to personal conversations and everything else that crossed their mind that was non work related. How about calling your clients to let them know how far behind the Doc is... I hope this man walks on water as its go an be hard to get me to change my mind on this review!
