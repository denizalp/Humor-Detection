The Donuts are okay but I wasn't always so pleased with the manager.  I don't feel that he always treated me very fairly.  The interior of this place is terrible.  And would you believe they don't serve iced coffee?  Overall the inside was very run down and hopelessly dated, and the Donuts were OK.  The manager wasn't so nice but his wife was very friendly.  There are some repeat customers who aren't so kind.  They just sit there and pretty much keep to themselves.  But you know what an occasional smile.  A friendly hello couldnt hurt.  It's on a very busy street and it is difficult most of the time pulling in and out of their parking lot.  They also don't serve coconut water.  A huge oversight on their behalf
