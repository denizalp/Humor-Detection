Goodness gracious was this a stressful bad experience! My little sister is getting married so she had all 4 of her bridesmaids meet at David's Bridal to shop for our bridesmaid dresses. We made an appointment for a Saturday afternoon. When we first got there we waited for about 20 minutes before anyone took us back to start trying on dresses. When you walk in the door and check in they have you just look around the store and see if we like anything. The problem with this is specific dresses come in specific colors and sizes so picking something off the rack to try on, you are not guaranteed that it comes in the color and size you need, so it was kind of a waste of time to search ourselves.\n\nAfter someone finally took us back to try on dresses they didn't have enough dressing rooms for us so we had to pair up. What was the point of scheduling a slot if they don't make enough room for your party? Its not like we had 10 bridesmaids there trying on dresses. Our first rep was absolutely awful! She wouldn't listen to any of our questions, she gave us no information about the dresses we were trying on, not helpful with color selections...... she did nothing. Another lady came over and said she was a supervisor and asked if we needed help, after I engaged with her for a bit, she was very helpful in pulling items my sister wanted to see on us, that came in her color choice. Luckily I found a dress I saw online and new it was convertible, so I started playing with it. NO SALES REPS told us that the dress I was trying on was a multi way dress which is what my sister was looking for, which solved all of our problems. We were all able to get the same dress which came in the color she want and we could each wear it a different way. If the reps were actually helpful we could have saved an hour and a half searching for dresses.\n\nWe went ahead and ordered the dresses since my sister liked them, but I am very nervous about my size. Usually when you order a dress you can have them custom make it, since you are ordering it and when it comes in its the exact size you need in the correct places. David's Bridal doesn't give you that option. They make you wait 6 weeks to order a dress in a size they sell it in normally and then when it gets in you have to get it altered. So I have to wait 6 weeks for the dress, hope it somewhat fits and then take it to a place to get altered.\n\nSuper frustrating, stressful and not worth the price. The dresses are not even that cheap to go through all the hassle. I rather have paid more at another store who would have helped a lot more and took custom orders so the dress comes in exactly how you need it. If you are planning a wedding the last thing you want to worry about is waiting 6-10 weeks for a bridesmaids dress to get in and be altered and hope the entire time its going to work.\n\nThis review is long so I will shorten up the 2nd half. My sister also made an appointment to look for wedding dresses. Complete waste of time! A different sales associate helped her but the exact same problem. They do not listen, they don't help, you work here you know dresses you do this every day, help my sister out with her questions please! I feel like maybe my sister should be more of a bridezilla so these sales associated would understand! FAIL! None of the wedding dresses or prices were worth it either.\n\nEveryone cross your fingers for me that I can get my dress to fit me & ladies who are planning a wedding, don't waste your time or money here!
