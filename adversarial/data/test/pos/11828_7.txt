First time I had Sonoran hot dog was during my first visit to Tucson.  Ever since then,  I have been wanting to try it again. My friend Jose grew up in Arizona his whole life and recommended me this place to try out.  \n\nIt isn't a big restaurant.  It has approximately 6 booths with 3 tables in the middle of the walkways.  If you come here with a huge party,  just be aware of this.  As soon as I walked in,  I saw a lady holding a huge glass on her hand with a spoon.  Holy moly it's cocktail shrimp!  I have to have that too.  We ordered a Sonoran hot dog,  cocktail shrimps as well as Carne Asada taco.  After being spoiled with the authentic sonoran hot dog,  I have to admit that it was no comparison (although it was still good). As for the cocktail shrimp,  you have a choice of ordering it with chips or crackers.  The portion is generous and delicious.  I kept picking out the shrimp until.... well,  I noticed that they did not devein them (yike yike yike).  I saw a huge black vein running through all of them. Also, $12.99 was a bit too pricy in my opinion. Neverthess, I am glad that I tried it. \n\nOverall,  my experience here was good.  I will not order the cocktail shrimp again but I do want to try other items on the menu.\n\nP.S.  I'm not sure why the restaurant puts the Sonoran hot dog stand outside when it was over 110 yesterday. I honestly feel bad for the guy who was standing there all by himself.
