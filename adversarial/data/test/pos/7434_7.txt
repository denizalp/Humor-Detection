Staff is rude.\n\npffffft if I want to go some where and be treated like a peace of shit I can go to Savers.\n\nYou'd think that because the staff that works here makes a decent amount of money they would be happy no matter what, but  ......oh no, buddy-o. They are hella rude.\n\nI can give them kudos for having such a nice building. \nKudos for getting me in and out within an hour on a Tuesday.\n\nHowever I can't give them credit for being professional.\nAs soon as I entered the scanning machine. Where I had to take off my shoes, jacket, and empty out each compartment of my purse. I knew things were going to go badly.\n\nI was in such a happy mood until I stood there for 45 minutes because there was absolutely no where to sit it was so over crowded.\n\nThe lady claiming to organize the line was so loud and obnoxious. One would walk up to her and ask a question and she would totally blow people off. \n\nI asked if I can just serve some weekend jail time for a traffic ticket the lady advised that even if I did I would still come out of jail owing them money.\n\nI asked if there was a statue of limitations she laughed and never answered my question. \n\nAnyway I would recommend coming on a Wednesday or Thursday towards the end of the day.
