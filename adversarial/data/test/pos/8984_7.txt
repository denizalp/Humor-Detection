Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the sales associate that helped me but he was very knowledgeable and informative. They have tons of products at awesome prices! The only complaint I would have is it being next to a cupcakery, biggest contradictions next to each other. lol (I was so tempted of going in, but I resisted..yay me!)
