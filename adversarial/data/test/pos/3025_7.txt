This is my favorite Starbucks in the immediate area. I've always gotten a greeting with a smile from Alex, Maria,  and Pat.\nI usually mobile order when I am in a hurry. \nThe drive thru line is popular, but there are plenty of parking spots if you don't mind walking just a few feet inside. In some locations this would be a huge hassle but it's easy peasy here. \n\nIf you are driving north on Tatum, this is right after Chili's.\n\nPatio area is inviting.
