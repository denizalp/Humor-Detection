I have LOVED to shop at this thrift store for many years.  They have a lot of quality clothes, and because this store is so busy, the stock is constantly rotating.  Last time, I got some jean overalls to wear to my friend's 90's party, and I found a beautiful skirt.  The time before that, I got some great jeans and a bunch of professional shirts and pants for my job, nearly enough to get through a week for less than $30.  The only thing I don't enjoy is trying on the clothes over the clothes I am wearing, in front of my fellow customers, as the store does not have fitting rooms.  Then again, who has ever encountered a CLEAN thrift store fitting room?  Perhaps we are better off without them.
