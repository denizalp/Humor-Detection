Love this quiet, plenty of parking center deep within Summerlin. Little chance of being accosted by peeps begging for change, always a plus!\nI frequent this CVS and sometimes Vons when I'm in the area, and used to visit the food outlets when I lived closer to Summerlin. The Bath & Body Works is a nice store for a strip mall.
