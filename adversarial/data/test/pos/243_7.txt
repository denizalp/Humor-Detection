I did not have the same experience others that rave about Dylan's here did, apparently. But, I did get the world's fastest men's cut (think super cuts). And to add to the oddness of my take on this place, it was the owner that did the cut! Unbelievable.  Too short. Too short. Too short.  I asked for a jagged cut. I got a straight boiler plate precision cut instead.  And did I mention too short?  Oh we'll, hair grows back, right?
