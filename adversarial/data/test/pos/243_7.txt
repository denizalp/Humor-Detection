Dr. John Wojcik is a pompous, insensitive ass with the bedside manner of a rabid racoon!\n\nLet me explain:\n\nMy 91-year-old father was a patient at Mountain View Hospital, suffering with pneumonia and COPD.  Everybody we encountered at the hospital was a caring and concerned professional... with the unfortunate exception of Dr. Wojcik.  After several days on a ventilator, it was decided that my father would be declared \"Code 3,\" which means he would be taken off the ventilator and nature would take its course.  Certainly, a difficult time for any family.\n\nWhile waiting for the morphine drip that would allow the ventilator to be removed and ease my father towards death, Dr. Wojcik stepped into the room, announcing himself as an associate of Dr. Tu, who had previously examined my dad.  Neither I nor my stepmother had ever laid eyes on Dr. Wojcik, who immediately determined that my father needed to have his oxygen increased.  When I asked why, my question was dismissed.  Dr. Wojcik then quickly examined my unconscious dad and questioned his wife about the patient's recent lifestyle activities.  All I could do at that point is wonder, why is he asking these questions?  The man is terminal.\n\nWhen my stepmother informed Dr. Wojcik that, prior to his pneumonia, her husband had not been on 24-hour oxygen (which was never prescribed), using it only when he needed it, the good doctor bluntly informed her that patients don't make those decisions, doctors do!  He then, unbelievably, accused my father of \"committing suicide!\"\n\nAt that point, I told this medical moron he was being completely inappropriate!  I explained the current situation to him, that my father was about to be allowed to die,  He mumbled some half-hearted condolence before slinking out of the room.\n\nThe next day, following my father's passing, a phone call to Dr. Wojcik's office to complain about this incident got me the voice mail of Elaine, the office manager.  I explained the encounter and said I felt an apology was in order.  Of course, neither I nor my stepmother have had any response.
