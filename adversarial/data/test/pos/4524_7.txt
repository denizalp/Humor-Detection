I was looking to take my mom out to nice dinner for her birthday. I made reservations online and put in the comment section that we were celebrating my moms birthday. I was surprised to not get a confirmation that they had received my reservation. I had to call the restaurant direct to confirm that they had received it ok. The hostess was very nice and stated that they had received it and also noted that we were celebrating a birthday.\n\nNow for the night of dinner. I was very surprised to walk into an empty restaurant and only find one other table (must have been a VIP table as the executive chef was their speaking with the table). The lounge area looked like there was a private birthday function. The music for lounge are was very lively and sounded wonderful. The waiter arrived and brought us water I asked to look at the wine menu. He came back about five minutes later, I ordered a glass of cab and my mom (birthday girl) ordered an ice tea. We also ordered an order of crab cakes as an appetizer. About 6- 8 mins later the appetizer came out with this plastic dome that you use to reheat food in the microwave so it does not splatter everywhere. The first thing that I noticed when the dome came off was that the crab cakes were burned. I was very skeptical that the crab cakes would be edible since they looked burned. First bite was crunchy and dry. When the waiter came back I asked him if he could have the chef that was still talking with the \"VIP Table\"  since we had arrived at the restaurant. A few minutes later the chef arrived at our table and we showed him the dry and burned crab cakes. He apologized and re-fired the crab cakes. The second round of crab cakes came out the same way as the first. We just ate them and moved on hoping that the next course would be better. \n\nAfter our first course was cleared we had noticed that now the assistant manager was now the person speaking with the couple at the \"VIP\" Table. It was also nice to see that it looked that there was someone celebrating a birthday in the lounge area and they were taking a desert with a candle. As the waitress presented the dessert the band that was playing sang Happy Birthday. \n\nAs our main course came out I had noticed that our drinks had yet to come out. I asked the waiter about our drinks and he had to ask our orders again because he could not remember.\n\nI had ordered a new york strip medium rare that came out again with the clear plastic dome and my mother had ordered a shrimp dish. Looking at my moms dish she was served many very large shrimp and my steak was presented well with a garnish of mashed potatoes. As soon as In cut into my steak I had noticed that it was extremely over cooked. (How do you mess up a quality piece of meat?) I asked the waiter to let me speak to the chef again so he could take a look at  the meat. We waited about 5 mins and no chef came. I noticed that the waiter went over to the \"VIP\" table and spoke to the manager and she came over. She asked if there was something wrong with my dish. I had stated to her that I was waiting to speak to the executive chef and she stated the chef had gone home \"because he was no longer needed,\" Really I guess my table meant nothing since the VIP table already had gotten their dessert. I asked the manager what she thought the temperature was on my steak and she immediately stated medium well. No where near medium rare. Again she offered to re-fire my main course. As I was waiting for the steak to come out our sides that we had ordered got cold. Finally about ten minutes later my new steak comes out and I touch it with my fork and notice that the steak is very soft. I then cut into the steak and sure enough its completely cold red center. I looked at the manager and told her that there was no way that this steak was cooked to 135 degrees for a medium rare steak. She said that it was a 135 degree steak. I then told her I would keep it since my mom had already finished her mea which she said was very good. On a side note the macaroni and 4 cheese was very good. \n\nNow comes to the bill why was I not surprised to see I was fully charged for a horrible meal. The only saving grace was that I had a groupon for the dinner. But still seemed to be very expensive $100 for a new york strip, shrimp, order of crab cakes, 1 glass of wine, 1 iced tea, and two sides.\n\nBut then I was even more shocked that they did not even wish my mom a happy birthday or even bring her a dessert how they had for the other couple.\n\nThis whole evening was a very disappointing. I was shocked on how bad of quality of food and customer service for signature restaurant at a Scottsdale resort.\nI was wanting a special night for a my mom and was seriously disappointed. There are many more placed within 2 or 3 blocks that are better that this restaurant for the same price point.
