I went to Shoushin for dinner with my boyfriend and I have been to almost all the top notch places in the city. I would like to start by saying the food was amazing. Simple, clean and super fresh. Aside from the food, the chef Jackie had an arrogance to him that disappointed me. He was a bit snobby and when I asked about a certain fish his responses were very patronizing. I prefer him to not talk. \n\nHope this was helpful.
