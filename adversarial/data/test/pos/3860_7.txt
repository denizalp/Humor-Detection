Went there for a \"Friends trivia night\". I called at noon and asked when should we arrive in order to participate, and was told \"...be here by 6:00.\" The event was to start at 7 PM. We got there at 5:30 PM. The place was nearly empty, with one or two people holding 5 separate tables for six, eight, or 10 people. The rude, and unpleasant \"manager\" refused to let me and my guest sit at any of the 30+ open seats saying they were \"reserved for people who said they were coming\". I asked, \"How long are you going to let these empty seats remain empty?\" Answer: \"6:30.\" This is total bullshit. That means that for at least the next hour the kitchen could not prepare or sell food, and the bar could not serve or sell drinks. Seems like a waste of time and money for the staff who is just sitting around waiting on the 6 people holding tables for their friends. An exceptional loss of income. Basically, 5 people can tie up a restaurant that seats 60+ people for up to 1\/2 hour before the trivia contest.\n\nNext time Carly's has an event, I am going to go in really early and tell them I have 60 friends coming and don't let anyone else sit down until my friends get there. What a stupid fucking policy. This place sucks ass. I will never go there. I can't recommend anyone ever go there. \n\nAnd, because this review is to be solidly NEGATIVE, the manager whose name is Nubia was the RUDEST, most insensitive, and wholly unfit person for her position. She should not be allowed to deal with other humans.
