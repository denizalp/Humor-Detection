I was just an out of towner, passing through.  The market was worth a look but wasn't as big or bustling or locally-oriented as I had hoped.   \n\nThe cheese shop inside was the only booth that caught my attention for any period of time.  Cheeses from all over NC and beyond, samples provided.  They also had other goodies - we picked up a nice salami and some Brooklyn Bloody Mary mix that you can't typically find.\n\nHopefully this place will grow and thrive.  Go!  Buy something!
