Welcome back to my life Target. I am done with Walmart's crappy cheap clothes. You really do get what you pay for. But I'm so thrifty that I kept going back to Walmart. The feeling I get when walking into Target is refreshing. The store is so organized clean and put together. It's like which friend would you rather hang out with. The employees are knowledgeable and caring. I can't say enough about this well stocked store. The only issue is they don't have a jewelry counter. But I have a feeling there was no need for it. You may pay a little extra but I'm worth it.
