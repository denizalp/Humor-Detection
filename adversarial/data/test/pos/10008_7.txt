It's typical Harbor Freight. No frills, no surprises. This store is new and still clean which is a good thing. The location is not the greatest and difficult to get in and out of from McKnight but most businesses along that strip share the same problem. \n\nIt's an ok place to pick up inexpensive tools and supplies. But let's face it, quality isn't their hallmark. When your $6 bolt cutter snaps into two pieces and the bolt remains, don't be surprised. Oh, and the huge selection of \"Pittsburgh\" brand tools are Chinese. So unless you're a real collector of things \"Pittsburgh\", I'd stay away from those. Or be prepared to replace them routinely.
