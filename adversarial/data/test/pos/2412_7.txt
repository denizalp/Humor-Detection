For me, Rika Arepa Express has _almost_ come full circle in more ways than one.\n\nThe first time that I visited the former food truck was when they parked in front of Bad Beat Brewing. Their arepas tasted magical that evening. Tonight, they set up their tent outside of CraftHaus Brewery, just a few hundred feet away. The magic wasn't completely back, but it was enough to bring my impression of Rika up from a mere 3.5 to a respectable 4.5.\n\nI went back to my first love, the Pabellon ($6). It was very good! It still lacked the original Pabellon's powerful plantain punch (perhaps pointing me toward a combo or side order next time), but the shredded beef was delicious, the arepa had a bit more crisp to it than on my previous Pabellon attempt, and the black beans and mozzarella did nothing but help. If I'm being quite honest, however, their creamy cilantro sauce almost makes or breaks their food. It was super addictive, and I recommend eating at or near the tent just to avoid running out of sauce. I ended up stepping out of my car twice during the course of dinner for sauce refills.\n\nTheir take on the Empanada ($2.50) was a hot, crispy shell fully surrounding the piping hot interior. They only had the shredded beef filling tonight, but it was great and went well with their sauce. Then again, I do suspect that a lot of things would go well with that sauce. Anyway, I wouldn't mind trying the chicken or even the cheese variants in the future. It's a good value for a hand-sized (not just handheld) treat.\n\nI'm cool with rounding my Rika rating up to 5 stars based on tonight's experience. I didn't expect them to come close to matching the original owners' creations after the initial letdown, so I was pleasantly surprised. This meal was very satisfying, and the Pabellon was more memorable than the arepas that I've had elsewhere in town. I'm much more interested now in visiting their regular spot regularly and\/or pulling the trigger on a delivery order.
