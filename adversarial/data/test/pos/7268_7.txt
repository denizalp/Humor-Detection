Read the reviews from this place a couple weeks ago and got excited, and as usual...I was let down!!! I never like to review a place after one visit anymore, so I gave it a couple chances. Fail fail fail. \n\nTo succeed in business, you need great customer service. This place does not have it. After reading on their website that they close at 9pm, I get in my car around 7:45pm to travel 11 miles to this place. I arrive around 8:15pm. It's a family of four head of me in line. The guy behind the register is preparing some take out orders and never acknowledged them. They had enough with the waiting, and the lady says she's ready to order. His response? \"Oh we're closed\". What the hell are you talking about you're closed? He says \"we close at 8:30 and its 8:31\". I couldn't believe what I was seeing or hearing! If the customer is inside before those doors are locked? You're still open for them!!! The lady and her family angrily walk out, and I do the same. What made me even more mad??? I get to my car and see that it's only 8:24pm!!! The boy was straight up lying to our faces!!!\n\nI told myself that I was done with that place, but because of such high remarks on yelp, I wanted to try the food. Decided to go back the weekend after, early in the day, so I can see if the hype was real. Ordered 3 wings, 3 tenders and fries. Back in college, I worked for KFC... So I know exactly what old fryer oil looks like when used on chicken, and what it smells like. Old oil (reused or not changed) will make your chicken darker, and make it taste funny. This was the case with Chicken Shack. Absolutely nasty. Fries were soggy and lacking taste. It was so bad that it prompted me to go online to find out who owns this place. Whoever you are...we need to speak. \n\nYou served me a trash worthy product. Get it together. Will not return.
