\"Oh,\" I thought, \"maybe I'm just in the wrong part of the hotel. Maybe it's not as loud at night as I thought?\"\n\nREADING REVIEWS....\n\n\n\"Oh,\" I thought, \"I guess it's not just me. Kinda relieved.\"\n\nSo let's address that first off: Yes. You're going to hear loud bumpin' music, I think. Not sure where it was coming from, but when you have a great location withing walking (stumbling?) distance to the Scottsdale nightlife, that's probably the culprit. With great nightlife, comes great bumping.\n\nLight sleepers, look elsewhere. Bar and club goers, this is your scene. \n\nI visited in early 2017 and this place was brand new (remodeled?). Still smelled new, and everything was shiny. Massive love to the front desk who smiled through all the flurry of people traveling in and out. \n\nSince I drove, I also have to give huge props to the parking garage and free parking around. It's a little scarce, but I lucked into a spot and didn't look back. Valet parking drives me up the wall, and here I could walk out the door by the front desk and jump in the car. Perfect. Lovely. \n\nWifi was sufficient for my needs. I liked the room. It's got that modern swank that Aloft hotels are known for. I didn't spend much time in the room, but the shower was only so-so. Sufficient for my needs, and probably more typical water pressure (read: water conservation measures) to have the showerhead underwhelm a bit. I'm not picky, but it does make me really appreciate the ones that blast you through the back wall of the shower.\n\nJust know before you go: it isn't so much about rest here, as it is about location, nice amenities (pool & bar, anyone) and enjoying Scottsdale to the wee hours of the morning.
