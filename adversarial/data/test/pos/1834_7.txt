I was finally able to stop here today while out with my mother-in-law. We like to sit outside when the weather's nice, so I thought this would be a good choice. We stopped in right at lunchtime, and the place was pretty busy. The menu is the perfect size...not too many choices, but enough. The have breakfast items, burgers and sandwiches, footlong hotdogs, salads, soups, and quesadillas. My mother in law got the Roasted Turkey Avocado BeeLT and I chose the Roasted Turkey Swiss Bacon Sandwich. Each is served with your choice of tater tots, chips, coleslaw, or a piece of fruit...we both got coleslaw. We were given a number, got our drinks, and went outside. \n\nFor as busy as they were for lunch, I was actually surprised we got our food as quickly as we did. While I noticed that several other yelpers stated that the wait time was long, this was not the case today. We wait approximately 4 - 5 minutes for our sandwiches and coleslaw, which also came with a pickle. Both meals were good and just enough to eat...to the point where I was full but not stuffed by any means. I prefer my coleslaw vinegary as opposed to creamy, but it was quite good. \n\nMore Pros: Nice, clean atmosphere. Perfect for breakfast or lunch. The dining and outside areas are such that you could sit for a while with your laptop or iPad or whatever Starbucks style, if you're into that (free WiFi). There are also a few large booths, big enough for a party of six of seven, if you pull a chair up to the end of the booth. Lots of healthy options if you're feeling like that's the way to go. But they also serve burgers, hotdogs, and pastries, if you just wanna say who cares, I eat what I want! \n\nCons: As Renee stated, the ventilation isn't the best and, although we sat outside, I could still smell food on my clothes after we left. Meh. And, even though many of the items are reasonably priced, I feel some of the menu items are a little on the expensive side. But then again, I'm super cheap, so...you decide.
