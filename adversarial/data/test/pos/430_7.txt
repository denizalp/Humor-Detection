It deserves five stars if only judging by size, but by overall experience, definitely 3 stars. The management seems to have a problem with maintenance, of showers and sauna. Crowds have been thin on weekends, despite promotions to beef up the traffic. Mostly older men, especially less attractive ones. The bathhouse scene in Cleveland has declined in recent years. The other baths in town- Club Cleveland- closed recently. Flex is the only game in town, and not busy most of the town. One would expect Saturday night to be jumping, but often the hot guys are few and far between. The size has its disadvantages too. So many hallways and rooms that it can be very easy to miss the man youre looking for. Also the neighborhood is sketchy- mostly day laborers and homeless wandering back streets near the railroad tracks. Two gay bars, though, are close by, Mean Bull on Hamilton Ave and Leather Stallion on St Clair.
