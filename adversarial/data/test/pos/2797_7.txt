As far as Vegas hotels go, the Wynn is the gold standard (along with its twin, the Encore). As a native Californian (raised in Los Angeles), my family has been bringing me to Vegas since I was a little sprout, and I've consequently stayed at my fair share of hotels on The Strip. But since the Wynn\/Encore opened its doors, my family won't stay anywhere else when we're in Sin City.\n\nI'm not a gambler and don't party as much as I used to, post-college. Still, some of my fondest memories of that time are of being freshly 21 and dancing with friends to Calvin Harris' set at Wynn's nightclub (by comparison, I don't think I've step foot in a Los Angeles club that I actually liked). They also have the Beach Club during the day that hosts some awesome events. I can't attest to the gambling aspect personally, but my grandma absolutely loves to gamble, and this hotel is by far her favorite place to indulge in it, and the Wynn accommodates her hobby handsomely. My dad loves their casino as well.\n\nI usually come to Vegas with my mom (who, like me, isn't into gambling) to accompany my grandma, and we love the Wynn (and Vegas in general) for its other decadences: the dining and the shopping and the entertainment and the interior design. Simply put, this hotel is stunning. Steve Wynn has excellent taste after years of being a Vegas hotel titan, and he definitely reserved the best of his creative vision for his namesake hotel (and the Encore, of course). There are always gorgeous art pieces (the most recent time I was here, there was an actual merry-go-round and hot air balloon constructed completely out of flowers, in different parts of the casino). I always look around at the stunning decor with googly eyes, even though I've seen it at least half a dozen times. It's truly a sight to see. The rooms are beautiful too, and so comfortable - they have sweeping views of The Strip\/Wynn golf course, and are just immaculate. The shopping (at the Wynn Esplanade) is great too - they have all of the major designers (my personal favorite is the Chloe store), as well as some truly beautiful interior design shops. It's always nice to window shop or, alternately, pick out the perfect splurge. But my favorite part of the Wynn is the dining. Their food is excellent - Wazuzu, Botero, Tableau, The Buffet, wherever - and always such a great experience. They have a variety of cuisines as well - you can find just about anything you want. Also, Wynn's Cirque show - Le Reve - is amazingly beautiful. You have to see it at least once.\n\nI highly, highly recommend this hotel. It's by and far the best in Vegas!
