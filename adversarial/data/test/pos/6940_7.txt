IT TAKES A VILLAGE \n\n   It takes a Village to bring good food and fun times with decent prices to the people. Throughout the Las Vegas Valley , when it comes to good food and fun times at decent prices, and a down to earth bar to enjoy an Ellis Island beer, the Village Pub has the people covered. \n\n  Ever since I moved to the Las Vegas area in 2004, I have been a fan of the Village Pub. It was in the last year that I really spent time in a Village Pub at the Desert Shores location before and after walking along the ethereal shores of Lake Jacqueline. I predict a review for this location in the near future. The thing is that Desert Shores is around twenty miles from my place. The Eastern Avenue at Wigwam Lane Village Pub is convenient to my work and home. During the past three late Saturday afternoons I spent time here after work. Each of the three times spent here, I  intentionally ordered a different entree. This review is a report of my three experiences here in the month of January, 2015. \n\nJanuary 17: \n\n  As soon as I walked inside, I set eyes on a chalkboard menu displaying the outstanding daily specials. Recently on a Friday in the Desert Shores Village, I ordered the $8.99 fried shrimp special and truly relished every bite. Once I looked at the regular menu, there was no need for the Saturday $13.99 rib special.\n\n   Once you walk inside this Village, you feel like you are dining in England. This is a divided Village with a smoky bar separated from a smoke free restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is dark red with walls adorned with paintings and tvs. In its unique way minus windows it is a Village in a world of its own. \n\n  I ordered the Greek Penne Pasta ($9.99). It included soup or salad. I ordered the cup of the cream of broccoli soup. On all three soups, cream of broccoli was the soup. The Greek Penne Pasta with the chicken and penne pasta was decent. But the coffee needs improvement. \n\nJanuary 24:\n\n   The speed of service is not their strong point. Their were some long gaps in service. Especially from finishing the meal to the check. But in the Village, people are not rushed. \n\n   I ordered the Chicken Francise ($10 .99). Instead of the soup I ordered the house salad. The Chicken Francise was a good choice. On the plate was a sufficient portion of a chicken cutlet saut√©ed in lemon, white wine, butter, and garlic, over rice pilaf and veggies. It was both delicious and filling making my taste buds feel like a Baron of the Village. I was looking forward to my next experience here. \n\n  After the diner, I hung out in the bar. I enjoyed an Ellis Island lite draft while playing Keno. What I don't like about the bar is that they discourage you from paying when you get the beer. This isn't the most persistent service which results in a wait from when you want to hit the road to when you can pay. Overall Jamie is a good bartender. \n\nJanuary 31:\n\n    Today I opted for the fish & chips ($9.99 and soup or salad $1.99 extra). I had overheard the servers telling the customers that the fish & chips are their favorite. The menu boasts that it is simply the best for over forty years. Their three large fish &  chips are Icelandic cod dipped in a beer batter sauce made from Ellis Island beer. As I delved into their fish and chips I enjoyed the taste of the Icelandic cod dipped in tarts sauce between bites of steak fries and sips of Coke. But it wasn't the best. How could it be? When I chow down on fish & chips, cole slaw is the food companion of choice. I strongly think that Cole slaw would of improved the fish &  chips dinner. In my opinion hitherto now, Miller's Ale House serves the best fish & chips. \n\n  After the dinner, I hung out in the bar. It was a similar experience to the 17th.\n\nThe Village is in my future:\n\n   There are dinner entrees that I am looking forward to enjoying at a Village Pub in the future. They include the pasta mariana with meatballs, chicken parmesan, and a burger. What I anticipate happening is that I will be enjoying them in a different Village Pub regardless that I am a fan of this location. Preferably this location will be along the ethereal shores of Lake Jacqueline and or another Village that I will become acquainted with.
