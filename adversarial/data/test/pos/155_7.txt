Sneaky Trick to Rip you off!\nYou get a menu with a partial list of food items. Then the waitress VERBALLY tells you to consider \"Today's Specials\". You assume that \"Today's Specials\" will be good value for your money. You are not told of the prices of \"Today's Specials\". You unassumingly order the specials, hoping you are getting a good deal. When you get your bill, you get a shock. The \"Today's Specials\" cost you 50% more that the menu items! Ouch! You explain your dilemma. You are told its your fault for assuming that \"Today's Specials\" are good value! Who Knew? You never return there! They apparently don't want repeat customers!
