I do not have the ability to write a review that could describe how great Sassi is, but here we go.\n\nThe restaurant is basically a multimillion dollar villa perched high on the Scottsdale desert.  The wait staff is amazing, the manager is phenomenal and the food is like nothing I have had before.  On several occasions the staff has gone above and beyond to \"wow\" us and they update the menu seasonally to keep it fresh.\n\nThe ambiance is very classy and the waiter Sal with his fresh off the boat, Italian accent is awesome.  You could take a woman on a date here but I warn you, if this is how you are going to set the bar for dining experiences...  there is nowhere but down from Sassi.\n\nAll of the food is superb but I highly recommend the following:\nSicilian style Eggplant Involtini \nOrecchiette con Salsiccia aka little ears pasta\nBuffalo Mozzarella Caprese\n\nI love eggplant dishes but the Eggplant Involtini is amazing.  The thinly sliced eggplants are rolled and stuffed with fresh mozzarella and baked in a tiny cast iron skillet.  The little ears pasta are so chewy and fresh, served in a delicate sauce.  The Buffalo Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes bring a tear to my eyes they are so enjoyable.\n\n\nAside from the dining experience, the picturesque views would be perfect for reception dinners or any other memorable experience.\n\ni can't say enough praise for Sassi or the staff.  If I ever meet the owners I will hug and thank them generously.
