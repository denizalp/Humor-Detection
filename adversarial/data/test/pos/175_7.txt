Do you like to decorate or are you that DIY person? Well this is the store for you!  Hobby Lobby offers so many different options when it comes to decorating your house. I feel that they keep up with the trends. The prices are reasonable so you're not breaking the bank. I have always been able to find thing on sale or just at a low price. Plus their holiday selections are pretty cool. If you like to sew they have a big selection of material to make your quilts, dresses etc...  I am always impressed with this store and the wonderful selection of decor items I can choose from. Plus they have plenty of people  helping with the checkout unlike the store Michael's which only has one person working
