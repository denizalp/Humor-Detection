I've been going to Puccini's for several years now. They haven't always given me the best hair cut, but always fixed it at no cost. As they should.\nTwo days ago, I went in for a walk-in with a disasterous result for which THEY DID NOT WANT TO COMPENSATE ME FOR. I have a cartilege piercing, which the hair dresser clearly saw and did NOT ask me to remove. She then proceeded to rip out the piercing while she was \"brushing\" my hair. She said to me, \"Let me know if I'm too rough.\" Oh ok, after you've already ripped out my earing? Cool. When I tried to get a refund because my piercing became infected, the manager told me that I'm just trying to get a freebee... Wow, professional! What kind of customer service is that? Hire better hair dressers, assholes, and treat your clients better. Despite the fact that none of you have a college education, you should know that professionalism is key to a successful business. You won't be getting my money any longer. For $40, I can find another hairdresser, and keep my ears. Chao!\n\nSee other user's comments in regards to the unprofessional nature of this salon.
