Hey yinz people visiting Pittsburgh .....\n\nWelcome n'at.  In addition to eating a Primantis sandwich, seeing PNC park, or whatever reason you're in our fair city, yinz have to take some time to check out the Duquesne incline.  It's super cool, a little thrilling, and affords yinz the best view of da Burgh you will get anywhere else.  So don't be a jagoff, check this ride out.
