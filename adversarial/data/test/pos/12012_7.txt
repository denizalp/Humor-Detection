Who says you can't experience a slice of sophistication in what appears to be a culture-depressed section of the Southwestern United States?\n\nSure, there are more bros, Creatine junkies and leather-y brown looking characters than you can imagine around these parts... but it's places like Petite Maison who break the mold from an outsider's vision of what Phoenix\/Scottsdale, Arizona is capable of. \n\nFirst of all, Chef James Porter is a rock star in the culinary scene in Scottsdale. He really walks the walk and talks the talk, and not because he's some up-and-coming kitchen punk with a sleeve of tattoos trying to become the next Food Network sensation, but because he's really good at what he does. If you consider yourself a foodie, he'll go toe-to-toe with you any time, and likely, he'll make you feel like a novice. With that being said, he's a pleasant guy to be around, and if you ever have a chance to share a beer with him at the bar, I highly recommend you take the time for a brief tête-à-tête. He's quite the engaging fellow!\n\nIntriguing discourse aside, Petite Maison will leave any fan of French fare in Arizona with sense of fulfillment aprés fete. With an urbane, yet simple menu on their hands, their daily grit will touch on just about every aspect of what makes French dining so enjoyable. Small bites like escargots and piquant fromage dot the carte du jour, while staples like coq au vin and steak frites round out the dinner menu. Not an overly robust selection to choose from, but just the right amount to raise the eyebrows of any eater. They'll also cater to anyone with dietary restrictions (exempli gratia: vegan diners) by whipping up any assortment of seasonal, off-menu vegetable selections. \n\nIn addition to the cuisine, they have a nice bar program in place with a handful of prohibition era cocktails, and a fun late night menu complete with a $5 \"red cup\" sangria chock full of fresh fruit, bathed in a crisp, sugary chardonnay. It's a steal for the taste and refreshment, and a perfect nightcap before ending the night in Scottsdale. \n\nAll in all, this proved to be quite the unexpected gem in a swath of muted colors and cacti as far as the eye can see. If anyone plans on catching Giants spring training, their facility is literally 4 blocks away from Petite Maison! Instead of hot dogs or cheese steaks after a day of baseball, refine your palate with a high-brow feast on the heels of ingesting some of America's favorite pastime.
