WARNING: Cash or GTFO\n\nThe Chuck Box feels like a place where a bunch of gruff guys just decided to start a simple, no-frills cookout cafe from their backyard. I want to complain about the long, disorganized lines in which you place orders 8 spots from the grill by yelling what you want...but it seems to work. No one's order gets messed up. \n\nThe burgers are legit...nice quality, lean beef that you get to watch sizzle on the flame. Don't order yours well-done, or the staff will roll their eyes, and people like me will give you dirty looks for holding up the line. I got the Tijuana torpedo, which is just pepper jack and green chile. Even though the bun is a simple, wimpy sesame, it still holds up to be a nice meal. Fries aren't shabby, either. I'd like the burger to get seasoned just a tad bit, but then again there's a couple dozen condiments for you to choose from.\n\nThe menu is simple, affordable, and filling. You can grab a table and a beer and catch some sports. It's just an old-fashioned establishment that deserves to survive the gentrification of pretentious local-this and organic-that eateries.
