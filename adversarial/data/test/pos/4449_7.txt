Orange-infused hot chocolate.\n\n!!\n\nIntensely flavourful and creamy, although it wasn't listed as orange-infused on the menu so if you aren't an orange + chocolate lover, best to ask beforehand. I also snagged one of their homemade marshmallows ($0.50), which come in two flavours, cinnamon or honey. I dunked one in the hot chocolate and ate the other whole, and it was ungodly good. I love this new discovery - I will be back all winter for this glorious hot chocolate!
