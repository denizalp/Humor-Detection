I know what you're thinking, a SECOND updated review for this place?  Yes, well, how often do you have a really awful experience at a restaurant? Probably at least a handful. And how often after that experience did you write a review about it?  Again, probably a few handfuls.  Well, how often have you written a review and then management contacted you and apologized about it?  \n\nI've had owners or management contact me about good reviews I've written, and had heartfelt \"Thank you\"s and the like, but never has anyone contacted me when I had a bad experience.  That has only ever happened to me once, and it happened to me with Axia.\n\nNot only did I get a sincere apology about something he didn't really have control over (people will be people sometimes and waiters are just that), but he offered me a meal on the house to make up for the experience.  \n\nNow, before you go thinking I'm changing this review just because I got a free meal, I'm not.  I'd already been to Axia four more times with the intent of writing an update before I was even contacted, and then I went a few more times before even telling the staff about the offer.  It wasn't until after I had already decided to write an update that we then went in and had the meal on the house. \n\nAnd boy was it delicious.  I'm never disappointed with the food at Axia, and a few reviewers knocked down stars for \"too much selection\"- but that is never, ever a bad thing.  I love that they include Japanese food and I love even more that their wide selection allows my husband and I to eat there with new choices every time, while bringing along friends and family who prefer to eat other things.  Everyone is happy with their food every time we come.  The selection is one of the strong points.  And everything tastes so good that you pretty much know you can't go wrong.\n\nAnd I have to say, even though I was terrified of having a bad experience again, we never did.  (We also haven't seen our server since, hmm.)   \n\nThe reason why I'm writing this update boils down to this, aside from the good food, and good experiences I had after the one bad, management contacted me and stayed in contact.  We conversed.  I apologized for writing a review but not writing a letter, because let's be honest, if I just write a review and don't write them a letter- how can they fix the problem?  Last time I wrote that mistakes happen, it's how you deal with the mistake that counts- and Axia blew me away with how they handled one mistake. \n\nI'll happily be, and am, a frequent visitor to Axia.  \n\nSpecial notes:\nThe vegetarian Korean dumplings are to die for.  \nThe vegetable tempura (dinner or appetizer) is one of my favorites!  \nMy husband gets the vegetable chow mien every single time and never tires of it.     \nThey have a great selection of vegan sushi. \nIf you are served by Josh (gosh I hope that's right), you're in for a wonderful experience.  He's delightful & attentive. \nOh, and in this hot weather, try the strawberry kiwi bubble tea (with tapioca)- it's delicious.
