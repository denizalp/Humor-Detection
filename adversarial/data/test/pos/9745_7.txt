It's interesting seeing some of the reviews on here. You would think Curry Leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale Indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area. \n\nCurry Leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners, taco bell, AZ Hair Co and Chuck E Cheese. It's a small place with tables to eat in, but I imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery. \n\nJeff P mentions \"It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food\" ... first of all, I disagree with this, and second, isn't America founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!? \n\nCurry Leaf is owned by a husband\/wife duo and I was super stoked at how nice the husband was. He answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other Indian establishments. While I waited for my food, we chatted about their business, my business and other random chit chat. As I was leaving, another gentleman came in and the husband sang out \"Hey Bob, how are you doing today?!?\" It's nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days. \n\nI ordered the Channa Masala bowl with Basmati Rice and a side of Cumin Potatoes and I was really impressed. The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99). \n\nThere are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you. I'm pretty sure he remembers every customer. \n\nThe bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as Tupperware. I think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value. \n\nIn a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of Styrofoam containers in our cars, I believe Curry Leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and I for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!
