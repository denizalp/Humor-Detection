Yay! I'm a fan: \n\n  With the hot weather turning Las Vegas into an oven, I have burnt out having my after-work cup of coffee. I am trying to stay away from too much of the 500-plus calories Frapucinos. So I have made a current switch to enjoying a cold beer or two after work. Al's Garage is one of the establishments that I have been frequenting lately during happy hour.\n\n   Al's Garage is located in The District at Green Valley Ranch in the shadow of Lucille's Barbecue. The first time I visited Al's Garage a month ago, I had zero idea of what to expect. For all I knew when I opened the doors, I could be walking into a biker bar.  When I opened the doors, I stepped into a bar that is garage themed. When I looked straight under slightly dim lighting, I saw a video game and the hall to the restroom. To my right was the table seating. To my left was the bar and TV sets. All around me was car garage memorabilia, such as hub caps. In the slightly crowded room, I walked left to the bar. I have been following this routine since.\n\n  When I sit at the bar, it is my understanding that I could get a $3 domestic draft from 4 to 7 PM or Midnight to 8 AM. It is also my understanding that Miller Lite seems to be the only domestic draft. If I want a draft beer for $4, choices include Blue Moon, Guiness, and Pilsner. It is also my understanding that off happy hour a draft Miller Lite is $4.50. Usually I wait the equivalent of doing a Yelp check-in for the bar tender to ask me what I want. The first time I hung out here, the bar tender was super cool. He started chatting with me about policies at Utah bars. Way different from the impression I had of the place before I walked in the door. The bar tender that has been serving me the following three visits is also cool. When I drink the Miller Lite, my attention will shift between the sports events airing on the television and my smart phone. There has rarely been any single women to keep my attention away from the screens. After two Miller Lites in around an hour to hour & half time, I leave in a more relaxed state than when I walked in. I will then spend some time in The District and Green Valley Ranch.\n\nStay Alive-Don't Drink & Drive......Sober up opportunities:\n\n  When I review a bar, I also take into consideration the immediate places to sober up . After two beers, I refuse to operate a motor vehicle for at least an hour. Especially when the Henderson Police Department is right across Green Valley Parkway. As the information sign flashed on the 215 \"Buzzed driving is drunk driving.\" I give Al's Garage a high score for the opportunities adjacent to it to sober up. There is the adjacent Green Valley Ranch where you could sober up over a dinner, Coffee Bean or a movie. I usually will get a fast food meal such as Panda Express. Then there is the District with its restaurants and shops. And if somebody plans on getting drunk, they could book a room at Green Valley Ranch.\n\n***The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 200 Challenge.
