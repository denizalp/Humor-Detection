There's definitely an amazing selection of food at Bacchanal, sure to please the most discerning of diners in Vegas. I visited this much hyped buffet last weekend, but unfortunately was unable to really get my $60's worth since I started feeling unwell once we sat down at the table (thanks to the hard shots I took earlier in the afternoon - never consume alcohol on a near empty stomach!). Fortunately, Bacchanal has the likes of pho and this God-like Chinese chicken ginseng soup (which comes in little pots, too), and after a few of those, I started to feel a bit better. I grabbed a few plates of good stuff and scoured some of the desserts, but like said, I just feel I didn't eat up to anywhere near what I paid for.\n\nThe set up and design of the buffet is modern, but has the elegance that Vegas buffets are known for. \n\nThe biggest downer for me aside from how my head was hurting was the service. Our waitress technically did do her job, but drinks came slow and she even served two guests in our party by slamming cups down when we asked for coffee. Not very professional (accidental or not), and we were given one carafe with a broken spout. Also, given that our party was billed a 15% gratuity fee since we had a large group (which might I add totaled to near $100), we expected service to be up to par. Not cool.\n\nI'm disappointed due to personal reasons, but I know I will definitely be back again to redeem myself. And for sure no more pre-alcohol next time!
