Not trying to be rude or disrespectful to the business, but I am a huge connoisseur of curry and BIryani, and this was the least palatable I have had in the valley. I asked for the curry to be mild and it literally was so spicy that it was inedible. I just filled up on the garlic naan, which was actually very good, hence the one star. The biryani seasoning flavor was not pleasant, coupled with a heavy hand on the salt. Chicken was a bit rubbery. The price tag was hefty too. If I'm going to pay $42 for takeout it better be worth every penny.
