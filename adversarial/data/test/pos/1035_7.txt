BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD CONFIRMED!!!!  I have sampled pizza from around the world and who would of thought that such perfection could come out of PHX!!! I am sorry I think some of you guys are griping just to gripe about this place.  So you have to wait and yes it can be multiple hours , but when that first bite of your perfectly crafted pizza hits your taste buds BAM!  I get taken away on a magical journey full of artisan mozzarella, Italian cheeses, house made sausage, perfect sauce,  all served on the perfect vessel made to carry all these ingredients to the top of Mt. Olympus where the gods consume such pizza goodness!  \nI feel like everyone has a story about how they got to PB and here is mine:\nI recently worked in England at one of the best restaurants in the world.  The chef has a book series called \"The Search For Perfection\".  One of the recipes from the book was the perfect pizza.  After this book was published (around 2 years ago) there was a constant discussion at work who served the best pizza in the world. Of course all the Europeans would say Italy, but there was always one or two chefs that would speak of the holy grail of pizza found in PHX. This is where I first heard of Pizzeria Bianco's magic.  I felt a little confused at first.  I always thought the best pizza in the country at least was found in NYC, but to hear that such a place existed in PHX that not only was best in country , but best in world I had to find a way to get there.  Finally the day came!  I was in town for a convention, but all I could think about was this pizza and I had not even had one yet.  \n\nIt was a Thursday night and I told all my coworkers we are going here.  I get them together around 430 and get over there at 5 and I already see the place is packed!  I am a little worried on how long the wait was going to be , but I was prepared to wait as long as possible.  I was there after all to eat pizza and nothing else.  The beautiful hostess approached me and told me that the wait would be 4 hours!  I was totally prepared but my co workers were not.  They decided no food is worth waiting that long for, but of course they were wrong.  I did not know what to do and proceeded to freak out a little.  Thinking I wouldn't get to try a piece of this ambrosial pizza.  It turns out during this time we were trying to figure out what to do another company had offered to take us out to dinner.  Now dinner had become business and I had to go.  This was around 630.  \n\nThey had reservations at this sushi place.  We sat down at seven and I begin to get more and more depressed that I might miss this pizza because this is our last night in town.  I snuck to the bathroom to call a friend so they can tell me what time PB stops serving.  I found out the last call is 10 and if you make by 10 you will be served.  Things are looking up!  I sort of rush us through a big sushi dinner.  In the back of my mind I didn't think I was going to make it because of the consumption of sushi, but I knew in my heart of hearts that I would make it.  As soon I get back to the hotel , around 845, I call a taxi and snuck away to the mecca of pizza AGAIN!  I get there around 920 and I get a sense of relief as soon as I smell the wood fired oven once again.  This hostess was pleased to see me again and told me I had about an hour to wait.  I was all by myself, full off sushi, and I couldn't even sit because I was so excited for what lies a head.   I pace impatiently outside and scowl at all the patrons in the restaurant hoping that it might hasten their meals.  \n\nFinally,  its my turn!  I get seated at the bar.  I immediately know what I want.  I could not make up my mind, so I just decide to order two pizzas!  I am a gourmand.  I order the Margarita because that is a true test of what a pizza maker is made out of and the Bianco verde.  The waiter even commented how he liked my style.  I told him I was doing important research and he understood.  I nearly cried when the first pizza came out.  The artisan look and smell was unbelievable.  The taste!!!  oh my god the taste!!!!  I am salivating now just writing about the smokey unadulterated perfection only created by such ovens and hands of a master.  I could not complete both of the pies and figured I would later and took them home.  Still at home hours later the pizza carried the magic of the restaurant with it.  I am truly humbled by my experience at Pizzeria Bianco.  I had the chance to talk to Chris Bianco , who is there every night making your pizza , I told him of my adventure getting to his place and he was very grateful.\n\nThis was def a highlight of my gastronomic experiences and would recommend this to anybody to do at least once before you died.  And all you haters need to look past the wait and the scene and just look at the pizza.
