After my introduction to La Bocca at an Official Yelp Event recently I was impressed enough to pay another visit.\n\nI had someone visiting from corporate.  Like me, he travels frequently and likes to check out interesting food and see new places.  So I thought Mill Ave. and La Bocca would fit the bill nicely.\n\nWe split bruschetta and a pizza, both were outstanding.  The bruschetta selections were as follows:  caprese with fresh pulled mozzarella - very nice.  roasted tomato, pesto & parm - also very nice with a robust pesto.  queen creek olives & ricotta - love the olives!  and the standout - prosciutto, fig & mascarpone - wonderful!  I first had the combo of fig and prosciutto at a reception in Berkeley and loved it then.  \n\nWe had the porco pizza.  Another interesting combination with pulled pork, serrano chili's and other good stuff.  The thin roasted crust at La Bocca is a hit with me!\n\nThe service was good but I did get a sense the server wanted to be somewhere else.  Oh well.  Overall a solid experience and I will be back.\n\nThey did have a terrible time keeping up with the food at the Yelp event to the point that I was actually waiting with others by the kitchen door to try and nab some food before it was gone.
