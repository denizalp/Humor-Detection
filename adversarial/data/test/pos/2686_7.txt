I should disclose that I went for their Gilmore Girls Luke's Diner pop-up, so it was a bit of a unique experience. More on that later, but I'll keep my rating to the drink and everyday part of the experience. \n\nIn lieu of the free coffee being offered for the promotion, I asked if I could purchase a hot chocolate, as I cannot have caffeine so the coffee was a no-go. Gratefully, the answer was yes. The cashier was kind and considerate, and service was pretty quick once I got my order in - under five minutes from placing my order to having it in my hand. Not bad with a line out the door and a line of cars in the drive-thru. The cup was nice and sturdy and Moka has the thickest anti-splash stickers I've ever seen. No sloshing here!\n\nMy hot chocolate itself was mediocre. It wasn't particularly creamy, nor did it have much chocolate flavor. It wasn't terrible, and definitely better than Swiss Miss, but if I was told I could never have one of their hot chocolates again I'd meet the news with a shrug. Thus, my three-star rating. \n\nI'd go back if someone else wanted to, but I'll need to do a deeper dive into their menu to see if anything else catches my eye before heading back on my own. \n\nOn a GG side note: the cashier that day was a man who was a great sport about wearing flannel and a backwards cap and standing in as Luke. As mentioned above he was kind and considerate in the way that he was undaunted by the stream of fangirls (I only spotted one man in line on my way out and he looked bewildered, leading me to believe he had no idea why there was a line out the door) and was asking everyone if they wanted their drink in a separate cup from their \"collectible\" Gilmore Girls cardboard cup & Luke's Diner coffee sleeve. For the curious, the diner pop-up was only a cardboard cutout of the Luke's sign and the no cell phones sign.
