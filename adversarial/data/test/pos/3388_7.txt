Wow, after spending a ton more money than I expected and feeling the  exhaustion set in after a long party weekend, I found myself at the beautiful Aria Sunday night. The sleep I found in that queen bed deserves five stars alone, but the room, casino, eateries, shops and the hotel itself warrants that same rating as well. \n\nArchitecturally, it is absolutely stunning. The whole layout of the City Center has been meticulously thought out and has paid off well for the mega-hotels there. The casino is easy to weave through, although not as grand as the casinos at the Belagio or Mirage, it is still keeping with its sumptuous overtones of sophistication and luxury. \n\nThe rooms there are immaculate. From the roman bathtub within the huge marbled shower to the spectacular city view to a gadget geek's dream galore, the room was simply beautiful. I'm not sure what prices are going for since I didn't pay for it, but whatever it is, I'd pay it to stay here again. \n\nSaturday afternoon, I spent some time pool side soaking up the sun, chilling with friends and enjoying the eye candy. I didn't go into Liquid, even though it was only $20 for the adult only pool party entrance fee. Apparently, good a time as it was, my friends had to put down $150 each for two lounge chairs, something I wasn't willing to do. The tab they ran on drinks on that side came out to $400 or so and the couple of girls that partied there saw themselves sick throughout the night. For less than half that, we got our buzz on with the free guest pool.\n\nFor everything associated with Aria --- great attention to detail. Just superb.
