I learned something this week. I learned that it's pretty darn hard to find movies for sale in the Valley. Try finding unique movies and you're really doomed. I learned that this week while I hunted for classic 80's films such as 16 Candles and Pretty in Pink. John Hughes. I'm sorry, but it's hard to find your movies anywhere in the Valley! \n\nSo I've reached the 11th hour and the last action item on my list is to find 80's movies to play on the big screen at my event. I searched high and low and alas, nothing. So, I decided to go to Best Buy to give it one last shot. Now it wasn't an easy hunt and I didn't end up finding the exact ones I wanted, but I did find Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller and Risky Business. Thank you Best Buy! Apparently you are one of the few remaining stores in the Valley that carries a wide variety of classic movies and not just the newest hits on the street. \n\nThe end.
