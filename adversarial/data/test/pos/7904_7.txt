Hah! I'm not the biggest fan of Chipotle, but you do what you got to do when you need to feed.  Recently shopping old Belz (now Premium South Outlets), I realized that meal #4 had to go down and meal #5 was just about 120 minutes later. Here's the dilemma when you're at Belz.  It's hard to find something quick, healthy, and did I mention quick.  One good thing about Chipotle is that they have brown rice, steak, and chicken all ready for you.  For a restaurant in a busy shopping outlet, you would think this Chipotle would be busy. But this Chipotle wasn't.  I entered the premises, requested for two scoops of their chicken\/brown rice and I was out with the quickness.  Roughly 10 oz of chicken for less than $10.  Now that's a big on protein and small on the wallet.  Yeah Buddy!!\n\nPS:  I know that Chipotle is known for their burritos, specifically their barbacoa burrito.  Burritos, Schmittos.  I'm sure their good.\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (402\/500)
