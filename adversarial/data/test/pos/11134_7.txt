I had been here a few times before but I'm not sure why I never wrote a review for this place.  It is right up the street from work, and they make a mean Banh Mi Sandwich!\n\nI decided to go with a #3 (Grilled lemongrass pork) with no mayo.  The pork is nice and tender, and just sweet enough from the marinade.  They stuff this in a huge (at least 12 inch) baguette. About that...the bread they use is great!  Crispy\/crunchy on the outside, and pillowy soft on the inside.  It is a perfect banh mi bread!  It comes with your normal banh mi veggies like radish, carrot, jalapeno and cilantro.  The radish is my favorite veggie on here.  Crunchy, yet easy to bite through.  Great textures throughout this sandwich!  Best part?  Only about $6.00 and the sandwiches are GIANT...could easily be split with someone else.\n\nI want to come back to try out their bowls which look awesome!  I don't crave a banh mi sandwich that often, but whenever I do, this is the spot in Phoenix to go to.  Reminds me of K Sandwiches in San Diego...and that is a good thing!  I'll be back soon enough!
