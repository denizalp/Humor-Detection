The grounds of this place are absolutely beautiful and the pricing is fairly competitive with surrounding resorts if you don't take alcohol into account.  It's too bad the wedding planner and  management are so terrible.  We had such a bad experience with them that we actually requested our deposit back and have started looking for a new venue a month before the wedding date.  We'll just have to explain to all our guests that we're changing venues because management there is so poor.
