One star. Why?\n\n1) no tap water. Really?  You're going to force me to pay 2.55 for fountain pop or whatever ridiculous price you charge bottled water? \n\n2) we came in and it took forever to get served. The owner also committed the cardinal sin of taking another tables order before ours even though we got seated first AND we said we're ready to order (to which the owners response was \"I'm taking only drink orders first\"). \n\n3) burger came with untoasted fridge cold buns. Fries were over fried. Kids meal never came with the drink as advertised on menu. \n\n4) burger itself was nothing to write home about. For a burger that costs on average of $15, I was expecting A LOT better.\n\nTake your chances. YMMV
