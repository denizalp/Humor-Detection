WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD RENTING!  My apartment did not have aproperly working washing machine, dryer, or dishwasher.  When I moved in there were missing blinds, the cabinets, over, and lighting were dirty.  I brought everything to management's attention on MANY occasions, and they never did anything about it.  When I asked for them to make things right, they refused unless I signed another lease.  OF COURSE I AM NOT GOING TO LIVE THERE AGAIN AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE!  And then they took my entire deposit for things that were already wrong with the apartment (and were documented).  I brought this to their attention, and again was ignored.  They could not be a more unethical business practice.  \n\nMy advice: DO NOT LIVE HERE!  If you like the location, try Palladium or the random condos across the street.  San Marin is not worth all the hassle.  \n\nI should have listened to the reviews before I moved, but did not have enough time to find another place.\n\nI really regret ever living there, all the time and effort I put into that apartment, and all of the disappointment when nothing was taken care of.  The management avoids all issues.
