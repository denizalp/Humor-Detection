Hell yes you're hot Magic Pony!\n\nThe Japanese toys and ironic books and pieces of locally painted art. The art gallery in the back has great, interesting stuff on sale with fabulous opening parties that are impossible to get into.\n\nBut for real, it is IMPOSSIBLE to go into this store, look around and not buy anything. The stuff can get pricey, but it's love. And last time I checked, love was pricey too. And totally worth it.
