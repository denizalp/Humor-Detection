This is the best shop that I have seen in the Phoenix area for supplements and health foods.  The store looks much larger on the inside than the outside.  The selection is overwhelming.  If they don't have it they probably don't make it!  Staff is very helpful, despite being pretty busy I was helped right away finding liposomal vitamin C.  Get this, the flu is bad this year and the vaccine is not very effective.  \n\nThey also have a good selection of health food too.   If you are concerned about your health check this  place out.
