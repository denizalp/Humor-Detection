Nello's, you snipered me with your crappy pizza!\n\nAnd I use crappy to describe what's now happening at our house. We're both in the bathroom (thank god there are two of them) crapping our brains out. Your pizza literally made us sick. Awesome!\n\nI should have known. When the pizza was cold as I walked away with it in my hand, I should have gone back and raised hell. When the less-than-bright to-go hostess couldn't figure out that a \"balsamic salad\" meant a salad with balsamic dressing and asked some 4 times what we wanted on it, I should have asked for my $28 FOR A SALAD AND A 12\" PIZZA back. But I didn't. Your reviews should have tipped me off, but I gave you a chance.\n\nAnd now my bum is paying for it. We're sick as can be from this stuff. If you're smart, stay far, far away from this grease and undercooked dough ball gut bomb emporium. \n\nOh wait, time to go to the toilet again! You've been warned, old Uncle Ian took one for the team so your back door doesn't have to! I feel horrid because I pushed my girlfriend into trying this place as opposed to our normal go to. Even better we drove 20 minutes for the fun of being able to ride our toilets like poop powered go-karts for the rest of the evening.\n\nSo, so disappointed.
