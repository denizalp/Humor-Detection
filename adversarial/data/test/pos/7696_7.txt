My wife and I walk by Merci all the time, and we're very glad we finally gave it a try for brunch.\n\nShe got the Croque Madame, and I got the Eggs Royale.  \nWe were both very happy.  Everything tasted very fresh, and it wasn't too expensive.\n\nThey only have 2 tables on their patio, which is a bit unfortunate, but it's dog-friendly, which is very nice.\n\nFor dinner, it's BYOB with an $8 Corkage Fee, which is a good deal.\n\nI would definitely recommend this as a casual brunch or dinner date.\n\nEnjoy!
