Service here was absolutely terrible.  From the server, to the guy that comes to drop off the bread, an all around negative experience.  You would think a place like this would hire higher quality staff, but the server was hard to understand with a heavy Hispanic accent.  Even worse, the African bloke that brought the bread over was difficult to understand with his thick accent, he spoke as quiet as a mouse, and had very poor enunciation.  After he did a terrible job at explaining - over explaining is closer to the truth - what the different types of bread were, he put on this haughty air like we're supposed to know all about bread types, which made him come off a snidy, which is hilarious considering his prestigious job merely consists of bringing out bread and talking about bread and that's it. Well done mate, on a tremendously challenging and uniquely distinguished job title, full of very important responsibilities.  Both the server and the bread retriever failed miserably at doing their jobs well.  I had loads better service at a basic breakfast joint the next morning than at this \"classy\" joint (Egg&I in case you're wondering).\n\nFood wise, the steak was pretty good, as was the Beef Wellington.  The puff pastry was outstanding, which made the beef in the middle that much more enjoyable.  The Fois Gras was forgettable, actually it was horrible.  The cauliflower would have been nice if it wasn't so charred and burnt. \n\nI reckon I won't be back here because it's just not worthy of the money spent.  Moving on.
