Worst delivery experience of my life: \nMy boyfriend and I ordered from Pearl Sushi two days in a row, the first day we waited out front while they made the food and we picked it up and took it home. I tipped them then, and in all honesty, I confused myself as to why I tipped for them doing their job, especially when it was $50 for the meal. We ordered again tonight and they are a 45 second drive from our apartment, after we paid for the meal (another $50) we decided not to tip - which is our right, and as a former server, I've experienced people who exercise that right before as well. I was completely shocked at what happened next. The delivery driver knocked a few times on our door, then proceeded to OPEN MY APARTMENT DOOR AND TRY TO WALK IN!! He was demanding a tip from us and actually refused to leave until we have him one. I told him I would not tip if he was going to ask for one, and he was still refusing to leave. We had no cash so he eventually left, but I have never experienced such rude and inappropriate behaviour in all my life. The restaurant is a 45 second drive, and they charge for delivery, so if I choose not to tip then I don't have to. I will NEVER order from them again, which is too bad for them since they are a take out and delivery only business, so to yell at your patrons for not tipping after they spent $50 on food that cost you $5 to make is completely unacceptable!
