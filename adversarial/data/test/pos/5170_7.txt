I came to Grand Lux Café on our most recent travel to Las Vegas. It was about 9 pm and we were starving. Grand Lux Café did not disappoint. We shared a burger which came with fries. It was more than enough for the two of us to share. We saw so many people leaving with to-go boxes that I was determined to not be one of them. We'll be back Grand Lux Café, next time we're in Vegas. \n2016 Review #61
