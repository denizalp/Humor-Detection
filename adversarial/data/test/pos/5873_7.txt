We have been going to Aunt Donna's for the past decade and just found out through one of the employees today that Donna will be moving and they had no idea what was going to happen to the business. I understand that life happens however I am extremely disappointed that Donna didn't think it important to call her loyal customers to let them know her plans and that we needed to start to look for other options for our pets.  I am extremely disappointed in how this was handled  by her and I feel badly for the employees who have to explain all to upset customers. We just had our 2 dogs done groomed today and extremely disappointed. There is no accountability here and no one in charge so I do not recommend booking here at all! I am not sure how much longer they will be open. Donna obviously do not care about her customers so DO NOT BOOK at this shop!
