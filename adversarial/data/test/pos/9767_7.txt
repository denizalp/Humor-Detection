The high Yelp rating and the Cajun theme was good enough for me to want to try.  Then there was a line.  Only about 20 folks in it.  Didn't seem like a bad thing, until you realize there is only 20 seats.  No tables, just a bar.  We were warned that our wait would be over an hour.  That was enough for me to change my mind.  But the folks in front of us told us that it was worth the wait.  So we waited.  And we waited.  The line really didn't seem to move at all.  After a god long time, we finally got the front position and still had to wait another 15 minutes.  This place better be good.  OMG, it was.  Wait.  I'm not kidding, Wait.  It was super amazing  I have eaten in a lot of great places in Vegas.  A lot.  This may be on the top of my list.  I was truly blown out by the flavors.  We all ordered different dishes, so it gave me the ability to sample most of them.  They all were equally great.  I can't wait to return, even if I have to wait an hour and half again.
