In response to an emergency situation due to a leak, I had the pleasure of working with Justin A. of Specialty Cleaning Services today.  As I am house-sitting for friends, I was extra cautious and concerned that the job be done well and right.  No reason to be concerned.  Justin showed up, took great care and concern for the job, was very friendly and personable, and did an overall great job!  Kudos to Justin!
