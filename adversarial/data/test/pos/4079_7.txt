If you hate saving money and love extremely mediocre food, then you will love Le Mont. \n\nWe came here for a Valentine's Day dinner. The view is nice but we were stuck near one of the side windows so we ended up having a poor view of the beautiful Downtown Pittsburgh. It was also snowing...but I can't blame wintry Mother Nature. Especially since she visits Pittsburgh so often.\n\nRed Flags:\n1- Our waitress, when we asked what the soup of the day was, completely forgot what was in the soup. She stuttered and pulled out a notepad and read it off to us. I would like to think Le Mont would step up their game during V-day weekend. The soup was also a boring vegetable soup. Gag.\n\n2- When my boyfriend ordered crabcakes:\nWaitress: You should order a side.\nHim: Why?\nWaitress: Because this entree is small. It only comes with one side.\nHim: Well what's the side?\nWaitress: a tomato.\n\nThe \"side\" is half a tomato with cheese on top. I got this side too. It was disgusting and undercooked. \n\n3- Our food. \nI understand that this place is expensive. But I expected at least decent quality food for the price!\n\nAppetizer: $17 - for FOUR pieces of cocktail shrimp in what tasted like jarred marinara sauce. This was especially painful because I bought a pack of cocktail shrimp and sauce for a third of the price at Trader Joe's the week before. \n\nMy lamb: ~$40 dollars. The sauce was nasty and brown and had absolutely no taste. I had to repeatedly put salt and pepper on it. The skin wasn't crisp and had congealed into this thick layer of fat that my teeth couldn't even get through.\n\nCrabcakes: ~$40 dollars. Mediocre, cold, and so boring. There was no presentation. It was literally two blocks of garbage on an empty plate. \n\nSide: We ordered a side of potatoes because our waitress wouldn't go away until we did. It was DISGUSTING. Even my boyfriend, who loves most potato-y things, couldn't stomach a second bite. It was like a potato gratin, but had been fried and left outside for 5 hours. That garbage was $7. \n\nDessert: $7 mediocre slice of cheesecake.\n\nA terrible experience -- I wouldn't pay $20 to eat this kind of food.
