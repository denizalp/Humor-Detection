Review is for public ice only. \n\nRink located inside casino. I've parking is best on North entrance. \n\nFinding the rink the first time was a problem, along with trying to find a place to park (midweek\/midday). I parked in the parking garage located on the southeast exit of the casino.  I didn't feel safe exiting my vehicle, or walking to the door.  Parking was filthy and dark (even for day).  \n\nEntering the casino (like all I suppose) you're slapped in the face with stale and fresh cigarette smoke, not an experience I appreciate heading to the ice. Once inside the rink isn't too difficult to find. \n\nWhen you get in the doors, it's difficult to figure out where\/who to pay.  Once you pay, you have to navigate to a bench and change footwear, I didn't see any welcoming locker rooms. \n\nSnack bar & vending\nNo real healthy choices for athletes and kids!  This is my biggest complaint at rinks, though I know in business to have what sells, have available some health (at least healthier) choices.  Examples: hard boiled eggs, tea\/iced tea (not to mention it's CHEAP for you).\n\nIce\nNicely kept!  Keep up the good work!\n\n*Handicap note-there is a small (somewhat scary) \nelevator that will take you up to the stands. Nice to have, but I wish they'd make it more appealing!!  Signs would be great, too!\n\nNotes to business\nPut visitor information on your webpage (locker room info, where to park, pricing, etc).  Have a flyer or something for guests (I'm referring to visiting competitive skaters, not public skaters). Visitors need to find places to change, leave their items, and local places to eat (non snack bar). \n\nSum it up \nI wouldn't go out of my way to skate here, there are other options in North LV. If you are limited on choice and need ice time, come prepared.
