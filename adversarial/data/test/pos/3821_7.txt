This place is okay. I'm not sure what the big hooplah is. Sure they have some stinking hot guys and girls working the pool but besides that I'm not sure what else they have going for them. If your definition of wild and crazy is stupid guys splashing in the pool like little children then by all means, this is the pool for you! Some idiot was splashing water at a security guy while he was setting some other dbag straight and he eventually got kicked out. Come on people, grow up. We're all adults here. On top of that, there was what seemed like a horrible rap video gone wrong. People were laughing at them but I think those girls thought everyone was thinking how cool they were. Somewhere between all of that there was an older white lady, nice body, who took off her top. Yeah she got kicked out soon after too.\n\nWe got a daybed and ordered chips and salsa, the cocktail push-up pops, beer and other frozen blended drinks. No remnants of alcohol in those drinks whatsoever although I'm sure there was at most a shot in each of them. \n\nAt around 5PM the pool started looking murky and it was totally warm. That's what you get when you have 200+ bodies in a pool. I think I'm going to stick with Encore Beach Club.
