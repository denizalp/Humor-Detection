I've driven by this place a million times and would have ventured nearly as many guesses that I would never eat at a place called Bei Jing.  First, I don't really like to eat MSG-ridden Chinese food.  Electric red sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken have never interested me.  Second, the look of the place kinda freaked me out.  But when the lady wants hot and sour soup and the fridge is lacking hot and sour soup, I can and will become interested in Bei Jing.  \n\nHot and spicy soup.  Delicious.  Wonton (I nearly typed wanton, which is something altogether different) soup.  Delicious.  Pork dumplings.  Pretty delicious.  Chicken fried rice.  Simple and pretty delicious.  Unlike most other fried rice, there was not a bag of frozen peas and carrots thrown in this rice.  And it was all quite cheap.  \n\nWill I eat here again?  Yes.  Will it be soon?  No.  Will I ever eat General Tso's chicken or chicken that looks like it has been dipped in cherry compote?  No.  Is Beijing one word or two?  It all depends on whose awning you're reading.
