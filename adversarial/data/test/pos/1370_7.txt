About a dozen of us had dinner here, as they accommodate large groups. We ordered a lot of sake and a lot of dishes. The standouts were the crispy broccoli, the beef satay, the coconut shrimp, the house salmon and chicken wings. The edamame were messy to eat. That was my only complaint. But they still tasted good.
