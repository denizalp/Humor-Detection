I have shopped here on a few occasions and each time I have received friendly and helpful service. They have many holistic products that are uncommon and hard to find anywhere else, like mango butter for the skin. They also have a great selection of vitamins, supplements and essential oils. It's small, a bit crowded when it comes to space and gives that mom and pop store kinda atmosphere. They also offer fresh cooked meals and juice\/shakes and alkaline water that you can try out and buy jugs by the gallon for an incredible price of $1.99. Your first gallon is free with a purchase of a $0.99 jug. Great stuff. I love having specialty stores like these around.
