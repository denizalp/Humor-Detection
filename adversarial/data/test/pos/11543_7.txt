I came here for a CMYE with the elite crew. I ordered a plain veil schnitzel with a side of mashed potatoes and washed it all down with a pint of beer which was $1 off for checking in.\n\nSchnitzel was fresh, tasty, delicious, and properly flattened. Staff surely did a great job beating my meat. Portions are 'murican. Location is cozy. Waitress was friendly and helpful.\n\nQuality schnitzel at a reasonable price. If you are craving schnitzel then this is the place you should go to.
