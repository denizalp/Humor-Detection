I am here visiting from Puerto Rico, they didn't accept my drivers license which is state issued in my country. I told the cab driver to drop me off at a great club and he takes me here. The security treated me like shit; just because I had an out of state drivers license.  Unacceptable!  Don't come to this place, the security personnel are pieces of crap.  A state ID is a state ID JUST BECAUSE YOU CANT READ SPANISH doesn't meant you can't accept my ID.
