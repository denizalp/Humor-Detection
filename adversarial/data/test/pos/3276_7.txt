4\/6\/12\n\nMy first visit, and it's been a long time coming!  According to my bookmarks page, I've wanted to try Chez Vous since 4\/25\/2011!  Funny that it took almost a year to do make it over here...\n\nLiked the interior, which is a mish-mash of dark brown leather seats and tables near a playable piano (I know, bec. I played \"Long Long Ago\" on it!) and regular wooden chairs and tables across the display cases.  It is intimate and very cozy, yet not too claustrophobic.  I met Romain, the affable young son of the owners of CV, who informed me that he'd just arrived from France less than two months ago.  I also enjoyed the music selections playing that morning and mentioned this to Romain, who replied that the music was from his iPod.  It was easy to like Romain, whose enthusiasm for music was clearly evident when he'd sing along as he did his tasks.  Ah, how do I love the French accent... too bad Romain's a bit too young for me-- perhaps he has an older brother?  ;)  \n\nFor my fist visit, I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to start http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ#88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ, and a Chef's Choice savory crepe for my main http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ#y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ.  The cappuccino was beautiful to look at, and delicious to taste- the foam in it was perfect!  The chocolate croissant, I was told, was fresh from the oven, although mine wasn't warm to the touch.  However, it tasted marvelous, and the crisp layers of the croissant revealed the freshness of the pastry.  (I did order another croissant to go, which had just come out of the oven.)  It was all I could do to eat only half of the pastry, since I still had the savory crepe to look forward to.  \n\nThe buckwheat crepe was filled with warmed cubes of green apple and chevre, and drizzled with honey and chives, and it came with a side salad (it automatically came with a brown sugar mustard dressing, something I cannot have, and which Romain replaced with fresh salad and Caesar dressing for me).  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw#5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw  It was dee-lish!  Sweet enough to satisfy my sweet breakfast cravings, yet not too sweet that the back of my lower jaw, where it meets my ears, hurts.  It felt a bit weird to have salad that early in the day, but I tried it anyway, in case it wilted before I had a chance to try it for lunch.  The dressing tasted very fresh, and I asked if it had eggs in it, to which Romain replied that it didn't, but didn't it taste like it did?  \"Yes, it does.\"  \n\nI truly enjoyed breakfast here, and, as you can see, it wouldn't be too long until my next visit...
