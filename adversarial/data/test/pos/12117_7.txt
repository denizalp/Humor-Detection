As of writing this review, I have paid for two separate burritos and have eaten neither.  Both were take out orders the same night. First one was a tear in their bag and the burrito fell out into some water on the ground and became uneatable.  No sympathy, made to pay for the remake.  Fair enough.   Second one was cold as ice halfway through.  Evidentially they make no attempts to warm up anything out of the fridge, so anything like Pico and Guacamole are as such.  Still no sympathy, no offers of a free soft drink or anything to help ease the pain of wasting an hour and a half and $18 on food I didn't eat.  Instead I am looked at like I am crazy for expecting my cooked burrito to be hot.  I don't expect free food, but at least the offer of something to help would've been nice.  If you can manage to eat the food it sounds good, and at least they allowed me to switch out the last burrito for a burger at no extra cost (considering that the burger is cheaper too).  \n\nEdit: having now eaten the burger and fries with it, it wasn't bad.  Was actually half decent.  But this is still one star, as for some reason they make a better burger joint than a Mexican place.   Might even go back for the burger, although in that market there are better places to go for cheaper.
