For lunch we decided to check this place out. We walked in and there was a menu above the cashier where you order. \n\nI ordered chicken mozzarella wrap with potato salad and a drink. I got pink lemonade to drink. After we placed our order, you grab your number with your drink cups. After getting my pink lemonade, hubby got a table outside since it was full inside. It was a nice day to eat outside anyway. \nAfter 10 or 15 minutes, our food was delivered to us. I took a bite out of my chicken mozzarella wrap and there was more lettuce and dressing in my wrap. There were only a couple slices of mozzarella and some chicken. It was descent but I would rather have less lettuce and tomato than chicken or the mozzarella. The potato salad was delicious. The best item out of my meal. Potato salad was filled with flavor such celery, onions, and potatoes were cooked well. \n\nThere is no table service but they clear your table for you after you finish eating. There is a tip jar in front so be sure to tip. Parking is limited but there is parking in the back.
