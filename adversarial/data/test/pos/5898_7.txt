Overall everything was fine, the food was good, sushi chef Daniel was good and knowledgeable, but tell the server to shut up already.  \n\nHe kept telling us that we should go to SLS's K***** and eat at his other job because the sushi and fish was so good there.  Every time he stopped by he would bring it up.  Soooo annoyinggggg.  \n\nAnyways, I did the all you can eat so I had many different types of fish while my friend ordered pork belly by recommendation of Daniel.  Everything was good and we had a little extra to take home.  \n\nI like this location a lot better than their original but lay off the annoying upsell of a different sushi establishment!  Geez.
