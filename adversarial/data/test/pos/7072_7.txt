I placed a carry out order for 2 people to pick up during my lunch time at work and when i got back to my desk the order was completely wrong. I was very understanding that people make mistakes and calmly expalined what happened. The girl who answered told me to come back and exchange the order. When i came back the \"gentleman\" that's always behind the counter (i believe he's the manager or owner) was very rude didnt even appologize and acted as if he is getting cheated out of something. After he examined the wrong order he said: \" so what do you want? You want me to make it right now?\" I had alredy wasted most of my lunch hr by this time and so I said yes. One hour after my co-worker and I finished our meals we were running to the bathroom. I cant say for sure they did something to my food or it was just unsanitary but I am never ever getting near that place.
