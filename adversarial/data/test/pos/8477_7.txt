Convenient Care is a Southwest Medical facility that I was not aware existed until I needed to make an appointment for what was ultimately bronchitis.  I have shopped at the Smith's in this parking lot numerous times, and never even noticed this tucked behind McDonald's.  \nIt was the closest place that had available appointments online, so I figured I would give it a shot. This is a small store front office that treats non-urgent and non-emergency cases for people 18 months or older and they are open Monday - Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM. (so only 'convenient' during banking hours...ha ha)\n\nI was very surprised when I walked into the waiting room.  It's small; but clean, modern, and welcoming with 4 loveseat type sofas and a self-serve beverage station that includes a Keurig type machine for coffee, tea, and hot chocolate, plus a hot & cold water machine.  This is a really nice touch.\n\nThere was only one other group waiting and I was greeted immediately upon entering.  The receptionist was very nice and gave me an amazingly minimal amount of paperwork to fill out.  Basically a short questionnaire and a couple of forms to sign.  After she processed them, she advised that my co-pay was $10, and gave me a receipt.\n\nI did wait longer than I expected given that there was only one other patient in the waiting room, but I am pretty sure there was only 1 doctor there and 3 other patients came out while I was waiting.  About a half-hour after I paid, I was taken back to one room for vitals, then moved to an exam room to wait for the doctor.  I waited another 15 minutes for Elena Zalan, who actually turned out to be a PA-C.  She was thorough and paid close attention to my symptoms, including listening to my lungs for a pretty long time.  After the exam, she sent my three prescriptions directly to CVS who texted me that they were ready within 20 minutes.\n\nOverall, I like this place way better than any other SW Medical facility I've been to and would utilize this office again for issues like a cold, minor sprain, etc.  It was actually 'Convenient' for me.
