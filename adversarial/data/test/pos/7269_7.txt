I only give them a one star because there is no option for ZERO stars.  Arrogant, unhelpful, and RUDE.  Telling me \"No no no\" before they even can see what I have in my hand & am asking for.\n\nThey advertise over 600 cabinet hinges, and even show the one I need in the pictures on the bins, but I'm not sure what the measurements mean.  Do I need 3\/8 or 1\/2?  I don't know, but I have the old hinge with me.  I want to replace ALL the cabinet hinges, not just a single one.  He doesn't even LOOK at what's in my hand & tells me they don't make them anymore.  Ok, seriously?  You haven't even seen what's in my hand!  I see pictures of EXACTLY the same hinge above the bins, can you please help me find the one shown?  Nope.  My cabinet will hang funny if I don't use the old hinges.\n\nOk, wow.  Went back to Home Depot & bought the new hinges with the ugly finish I didn't like, project done.\n\nJerks!
