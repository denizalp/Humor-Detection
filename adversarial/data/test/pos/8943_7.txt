This is Vegas as it was in it's beginnings. Rustic and charming with great steaks and a feel as if you could expect Frank, Dean and Sammy to walk through the place at any moment. I just loved the ambiance here and hated that our evening came to an end. The food, quality drinks, and excellent service were rivaled only by the fantastic view that is offered.  This was my first time at The Steakhouse but I am definitely putting it on my Vegas rotation list for great dining. I wanted to take the exterior glass elevator but it was closed down due to maintenance so I have to scratch one star. Pricey? YES. Worth it? OH HELL YES.
