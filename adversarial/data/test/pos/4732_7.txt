It's not fair to compare Medley Buffet to the Buffet at Bellagio, the buffet at Wynn or Bacchanal Buffet because this place is pretty cheap for a buffet.\n\n$11.99 for breakfast Mon-Sat\n$14.99 for lunch Mon-Sat\n$20.99 for dinner Sun-Tues 4 pm-8 pm) and Wed, Thurs & Sat(4 pm-9 pm)\n\nLocated at the Orleans Hotel & Casino, The Medley Buffet has create your own omelette station, basic breakfast stations (egg, sausage, bacon, pancake, waffle, etc), Chinese stations, Mexican stations, donuts, ham & sausage station and assorted pastries.\n\nI was excited to see donuts, sweet potato pancake, menudo & beef fried steak.\n\n3 stars!! \n\nMedley Buffet is almost yummylicious!!
