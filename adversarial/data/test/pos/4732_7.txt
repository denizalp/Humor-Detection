A restaurant floating in the 90's. A loner in the city which has no equal. Quality service but the food did not match either the prices or the service level. I ordered mussels as an appetizer. They came with 2 tablespoons of broth. They were characterless with no taste. My main Branzini was overcooked and over buttered. I can see Vibo probably has a loyal clientele who enjoy the 90's era and that sure is culinary democracy.\n\nSuresh Chawla\nToronto
