Maybe it's my fault for having high expectations, but I was disappointed with Lotus of Siam. \n\nWhen you get inside the restaurant, they have a bunch of magazine and newspaper clippings plastered on their walls, prestigious awards (James Beard), and countless photos of celebrities and world renowned chefs. You would think that it would just be the best Thai food you will ever eat outside of Thailand (which I haven't had the pleasure of visiting, yet)?\n\nI have a feeling it's because there aren't much options for Thai cuisine in the neighborhood that they give this place such distinction. I've had better Thai food in Los Angeles (Thai Town) and there is no shortage of Thai restaurants in LA.\n\nOverall, I am sad that it did not live up to the hype. I'll give this place another visit in the future and see if I have a better things to say next time.
