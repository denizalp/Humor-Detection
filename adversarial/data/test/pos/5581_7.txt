The service is horrible.\n\nI'm not too sure about the quality of the manicures\/pedicures, or the eyelash extensions BECAUSE THEY NEVER GAVE ME A CHANCE TO DO IT.\nI came in quite early, because I heard my friend got her eyelash extensions there for $40- that's obviously an amazing deal, so I came in and it was a completely empty shop, with a worker just sitting at a table buffing her nails.\nI asked her if they do eyelash extensions, and she hesitantly responds with a \"...no... now now\", then I ask if I can make an appointment to do it, and she looks around the store and just says \"no.. I can't, sorry\"\n\n\n\"Hi Amy, our store has never offer eye lash extensions since opened. If you mistook , please adjust your review. We are glad to hear from your comment on the actual services we offer at our stores.\nthanks\nAnnie\"\n*** THE OWNER\/WORKER HAS CREATED HER OWN REVIEW GIVING HERSELF 5 STARS AND REPLYING THAT HER BUSINESS NEVER GAVE EYELASH EXTENSIONS. Please please please tell me why my friend got eyelash extensions there then. PLEASE. \nNO. JUST NO. I will NOT adjust my review because my original train of thought still stands. If you don't offer eyelash extensions, WHY did your shitty worker just slowly say \"no..... not now.....\" are you KIDDING me?!\n\n\n...!?!?! Do you not want to run a business?!!?\nAt that point, my friend was like \"whatever, let's just go then.\" \n\nI'm so confused at this type of behaviour from a service that mostly earns from tip.. service based industries.. you need to learn that a short conversation can potentially lose a loyal customer forever.
