WOW!! I felt loved and welcomed as soon as I stepped foot in the building .. the praise and worship touched my soul .. Bishop Owens and Elect Lady Owens spoke the word of God in a POWERFUL life changing way .... and it was like they had been walking with me all week long. Thank God for a place that you can go to were ALL your needs can be met. God is real in this place ... Thank you Jesus for a well of water in a dry place! IF YOU NEED A NEW START... go to Immanuel's Temple
