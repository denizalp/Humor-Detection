As with most newer resorts in Las Vegas, The Palazzo is fantastically over-the-top. The decor is just amazing, and is immaculately maintained. Every single employee I encountered, from the front desk to poolside, was exceptionally helpful & pleasant. \n\nBooking nine rooms for my company at a corporate rate was fairly easy. Later, I had to add a couple of rooms, which necessitated a second call to reservations... Both phone reps were very friendly & helpful. In fact, on my second call, I was able to get complimentary late check out for my own room, along with the upper-tier Internet access, because the rep was sympathetic to my planning responsibilities. Definitely outstanding customer service! \n\nCheck-in was fairly easy, especially considering the number of rooms we had. I was able to get everyone checked-in within about 20-30 minutes, which I felt was very reasonable with that many rooms. Because it was very early in the day (around 10:30am), most of our rooms were still being prepared, but the front desk was able to issue keys & then text each guest when their room was ready. The Palazzo also offers complimentary baggage hold service, so we were able to enjoy our wait & walk around unencumbered.\n\nMy room was simply stunning! I later discovered I had the highest-floor room of my group, on the 42nd floor, overlooking the pools, Vegas Strip and the mountains to the west. What an incredible view! The window had a wide ledge, and I spent much time there, just gazing out at Las Vegas. And this *standard* room was HUGE! Two queen-size beds in the bedroom area that opened to a sunken sitting area with a corner sofa, TV cabinet and a desk. Unfortunately, I did have to use the desk to finish payroll that week, and found the view a bit distracting! But the desk was an ample size; I had no problems with the Wi-Fi, and it did seem to be very fast. The bathroom was gigantic, with a double sink and a separate vanity table with mirror, plus soaking tub, large glass shower stall, and toilet room. As the organizer in the *extra* room, I ended up with a couple of different roommates throughout my stay, each for a night or two, and then enjoyed the room by myself on the last night. On that final night, I managed to find time to soak in the tub and finish a cocktail. My only *complaint* was that housekeeping assumed all the female toiletries belonged to one person, and they occasionally co-mingled my items with my roommates'. Not a big deal, and we actually found it amusing.\n\nWhile here for 5 nights, I was able to patronize many restaurants & bars within the Palazzo, as well as the casino, and the adjacent conference center. The variety of dining options is astounding! I dined at several restaurants more than once, and enjoyed consistent food quality & service each time. On my final day, I was delighted to have a few hours to relax by a couple of the pools, and was equally impressed by the cleanliness of this area as well. The Palazzo offers several gorgeous pools on the west side of the building, which of course made sunbathing early in the day difficult. I actually had to find another chaise at the south end of the pool deck just to get a little more sun. But the pools were refreshing & the entire area well-landscaped. Overall, my stay at The Palazzo was incredible, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.
