I'm back logged on my reviews but this one got put to the front of the line because I have to say it was a major disappointment experiencing this place.. I usually wait till I try a place a few times before going star crazy but as stated I have things I need to say.. The reason they get two stars instead of zero and a escalation  is  when I called to ask wait times and when we were seated both the female who answered and the gentleman who seated us both who sadly I didn't get their names were friendly and informed...\nFood  quality and booze was good even if my experience was not .. so let's get on with this yelp rage review from another one of those hangry yelpers shall we? \n\n\nSo driving down Sahara on our way to Indian Friday night we drove past nacho daddy and I recalled I tried them out originally at a yelp event and fell hard for their Mexican corn offthe cob so of course I decided before my movie date Saturday it was time for margaritas and some Mexican nachos .. Fast fwd to my evening nacho daddy experience ..\n\n\nShawn our waiter set the tone for my Saturday night meal to where this place is going to be tabled for quite sometime before I try Them again ..which is lame cause I totally planned to bring someone who isn't a square bear (my bf doesn't drink much) that will drink and  shoot Scorpion shots when I was photo ready cause admittedly I was in cozy clothes to prep for three hours at the movies after so I was not \"fancy \" to do cute tourist like selfie scorpion shots ....\n\nMy biggest pet peeve when dining is being left thirsty .. I need soda usually diet or water and refills often lol my server failed from the jump with that.. I had asked some questions about the premium margaritas .. He didn't really say much but the jalape√±o is too spicy for him so  I got this cucumber chili one he recommended which wasn't on the menu but he told me about and my guy got a raspberry one both of which were tasty imo for the 11\/12$ price tag but the service went all bad when Shawn left to get those without asking if I need water but also having to be prompted to get some .. Worst thing is he not only brought our margaritas before the water that was requested but we had to ask for the water again and I continually saw him walking around talking to other co workers .. Being friendly ..I'm sorry he can love his co workers but service should prevail especially when I need water ..\n\nHe didn't recommend stuff and I had to do the digging and just responded we don't have it anymore so it got old for me really fast ..\nNow when date night occurs I typically go for app, two entrees and dessert plus booze  .. This situation already had  gone downhill fast ... It gous to one entree (maybe Shawn thought due to my attire I wasn't interested in spending money ) here is the thing usually I still eat my food and spend my money but I escalate the issue .. However being on a date and having my guy prefer to not make a scene I went another route which is not order stuff to lower my tab which helps make me feel less horrible for not tipping well but it leaves me to where I'm hangry and upset ..\n\nIf you do go here check in  on yelp and you'll get a free house margarita.. It was delicious  so I may go back to the bar sometime but..  \nBe advised I only got that free margarita to make sure he knew I was checked in but also cause I thought maybe the manager or supervisor would have to authorize it and come by cause I don't usually do top shelf so if I give it a thumbs up\nSo it's  fair to say they have a good bartender \n\nFilet nachos won the entree choice due to recommendation of the dude who seated us that was nice... They are 18 something and huge so we shared those fine but it was lack meat and had way too many beans but the taste was good ... Those beans are where Shawn and I went to the point of no return cause I was going to try another premium margarita and let my guy get his dessert but ..My \nmeal ended with my boyfriend and I waiting so long for Shawn to check back that the excessive beans on our nachos that had no meat were spread out on the dish and Shawn comes up and says \"are you done playing with your beans? Which \n\nA. I guess if we had aligned and related that would of been cute but we didn't \nB. You see it not eaten and don't ask what happened or how everything was.\nC. You had enough time to watch , lurk but not check in..\n\nMy boyfriend really wanted to try the churro banana split  but he had to make due with Ben and Jerrys at redrock.. Why? Cause I couldn't handle Shawn or the sight of beans any longer..it also delayed my finding good movie seats so thanks Shawn you win!! But seriously \n\nOverall this was just not a good experience but the quality of food was not bad it was meh ..
