I had been to this building several times when it was a Marie Callender's restaurant.  After being empty for a while, Blueberry Hill did some remodeling and opened in this spot.  I haven't been to a Blueberry Hill for over a year now.  \n\nI had spent the night at the Rio Hotel and given their food choices, I opted to come here for breakfast on the way home.\n\nI ordered the Texas chili omelette which is described on the menu as onions and American cheese with homemade Texas chili on top.  It's an open face omelette with lots of beans but a bit less chili than previous times I've had this.  The recipe has changed.  You have your choice of a side and I got hash browns.  I ordered rye toast.\n\nThere was a bus person who came around often and refilled coffee mugs as needed\/desired.  It was good to see him coming toward my table.\n\nI rarely am out of the neighborhood when I have breakfast.  This was a good choice.
