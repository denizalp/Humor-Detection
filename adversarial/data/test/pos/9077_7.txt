Southwest Airlines arrived in Charlotte in 2013 when they merged with Airtrain, giving them one gate and a couple of flights. For them, Charlotte is considered a \"spoke\" airport so unless you're headed to one of Southwest's focus cities - Baltimore, Chicago\/Midway, Houston\/Hobby or Orlando - then you're going to be connecting.\n\nAt CLT, Southwest is located in the A concourse with the other airlines that aren't US Airways. You'll find Delta, United and American in there as well. But just because it's the A concourse does NOT mean that you have to use the A security checkpoint. The entire airport is completely connected, so use whichever line is the shortest. Once you're in, you can easily walk to A.\n\nThe boarding process for Southwest, even though they have only one gate, is exactly the same as every other Southwest flight. They have set up the stands with A1-5, A6-10, A11-15, etc. When it's time to get ready to board, the gate agent will have everyone take their positions and then it's a neat filing process to get on board where there are no assigned seats and you can take whichever one you like.\n\nEnjoy Southwest and welcome to the Queen City. I hope that you bring your usual low fares with you!
