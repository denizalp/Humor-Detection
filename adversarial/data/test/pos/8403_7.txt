I recommend Sushi Yuki to anyone who believes that good sushi can not be found in a land-locked state. Also for anyone whose a little shy about ordering sushi for the first time. The menu has very concise descriptions of all the sushi, and the tables even have diagrams with pictures on them (granted, they're promotional material from one of the beer vendors they carry, but still). \n\nPersonally I recommend the boat. It's filling, it has a lovely layout, and  you can pretend you're a sea serpent or something. \n\nIf you hear the waitress laughing it's because you're eating the garnish. Take it out of your mouth and put it away.
