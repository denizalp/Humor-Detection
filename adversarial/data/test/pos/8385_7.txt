I haven't had maid service in a very long time because of past poor services. But I really needed some help so I found Superb on Yelp and read the reviews and took a chance. I booked online for a same day appointment. Not only were they on time very polite and professional my house is now immaculate! Stephanie & Elisabeth blew me away with all the hard work and elbow grease they put into my home. I even paid the extra 20 for the refrigerator and stove to be cleaned. Another lady showed up and busted out the frig it's amazing. I work long hours and pretty much surface clean so to have my house clean how I wish I had time for is wonderful. These ladies are truly Superb! Also they have great flat rates and I wasn't charged on my card until they were done. This is the only company I will use in the future.
