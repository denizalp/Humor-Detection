I like bootleg. It's not too far from my home in Boulder City.\n\nWe take the boy scout trail that leads to an over look of the city and lake mead. It's truly awesome to know that serenity and nature is right in our back yard. \n\nThe only thing that can get a little weird\/challenging is that for the first half of the hike,bikes are also allowed on the trail. You can get mowed down pretty easily if both parties aren't careful.
