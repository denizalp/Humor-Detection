I came here with friends for the buffet. This restaurant is spacious, has a beautiful patio and nice decor, including a huge flat screen TV. You can see the chefs making the food which is nice as well. The place is clean and the prices are reasonable too.\n\nFor the buffet, you get a little sheet of paper with a list of their food on it and tick off the food that you want. I really liked this system knowing that people were not hanging over or touching the food like in other buffets where you get and up and serve yourself. The food was very good too.\n\nThe major downfall of this place which hid all the other good aspects about the restaurant was the terrible service. The service is so terrible; I've never seen anything like it! The food took forever to come, our glass of water was never re-filled, it took 25 min between each small course for the servers to even be in view for us to call them over at our table and ask them for another sheet of paper so we could order our next plate. Once we finally received our sheet of paper to tick off the food we wanted, the whole process started all over again.\n\nI don't understand why the service was so bad; there were only 4-5 tables with people. I noticed that the other tables also had horrible service. They were waving down the waiters to get service, when they finally came into view, the servers would just disappear again.\n\nThere are plenty of other great sushi restaurants in the area that I can go to with better service. I rather go there instead.
