$2 for a dessert out? It has to be an error. I can now tell you it is not.  My family and stopped by tonight in search of this $2 dessert I have heard about and it was all I hoped for. For a total of a little over $8 I was able to buy three ice cream sandwich desserts and a large water. Wow! What a deal! I just can not see how they can keep the doors open with that price point, but I hope they keep it going. For the ice cream sandwich, I went with mint ice cream slammed between a chocolate chip cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. The cookies were perfectly soft and had good favor and the ice cream was decent and served its purpose.  The size of the sandwich was not huge but perfect for a nice treat. The service and process was fast an efficient with no complaints to note. I would for sure visit again. Is tomorrow to soon?
