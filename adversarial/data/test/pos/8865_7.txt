It's fairly difficult to find Apple Dumpling, so if you're willing to:\n\n1) make the trek to far away Urbana,\n2) be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian,\n3) subject your arteries to a deluge of fat, and\n4) eat in a large cafeteria-like room with the glaring white walls of a hospital,\n\nthen this place is for you.\n\nThe homemade apple dumplings are quite good actually. The beef and noodles (with LOTS of mashed potatoes) was great, but it got a little overwhelming after a couple large bites...I think my body was rejecting the sudden influx of calories.
