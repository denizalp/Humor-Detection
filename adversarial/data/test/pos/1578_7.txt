I haven't seen the rooms but...\n\n- The lobby is designed to look like Central Park\n- The New York street re-creations are very cool\n- Zumanity is a great show!\n- This hotel feels a bit like Disneyland\n- I lost money on the gambling tables...\n- I luckily did not lose my lunch on the roller coaster but I was not so impressed with it either...
