I would want to give this place 4.5 stars but I am rounding it off to a 5, because they deserve it.\n\nAs usual we were debating on which new restaurant to go to and we came across this Green corner restaurant. As we entered, the place looked clean and fresh. There were quiet a lot of people for Saturday lunch. We had to order before hand and take a seat. The person who took the order seemed friendly too.\n\nU can order any dish and it comes with three sides. We ordered Chicken shawarma with (salad, hummus & rice), Lamb kabab (French fries, hummus & rice). We got fresh hot food within 10min of the order. Oh man! This was the best shawarma I have had in a long time. The spices were great and the chicken was well cooked and roasted. The basmati rice had an amazing flavor, hummus & salad were alright. Also the lamb kabab - the kabab was mind blowing, it was juicy, fresh had right amount of flavors working its way. \n\nThe quantity was huge, we ate so much that we couldn't walk. The price for the quantity is very very reasonable. Only draw back we faced was they got the pita bread late - all the combos come with pita bread which we weren't aware. Apart from that I would love to go to this place again and highly recommend this authentic Mediterranean place.
