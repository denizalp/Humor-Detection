WOW\nThis ghetto salon is owned & operated by a woman who is in lalaland. \nI had an appointment with her for lash extensions, she was 45 min late! I am not even sure why I waited! \nAfter she was done & it was time to pay, the price was double than what was originally discussed! I am from NYC, don't try to get over on me. \nWhat a waste of time. Some people are just not on the same planet as us normal people.
