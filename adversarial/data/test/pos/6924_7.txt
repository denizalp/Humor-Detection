2nd cockroach in my bed this morning. First woke me up at 8am, on me... Not knowing what was on me the first reaction was to swipe it off, I put my phones flashlight on, and it was a roach that quickly scurried into the cracks of plaster (and everything else, because they don't fix anything here, EVER). I was texting my mother what happened laying in bed and paranoid as hell for 2 hours checking my surroundings. Couldn't sleep, went to feed my cat. Came back, flashlight on to find these pests on the floor, (woke up to 5 on the floor just this morning alone. Not including the two in my bed with me, this happens everyday. All day. And they aren't dead. And we bug spray) and low and behold there is another fucking cockroach wiggling it's legs in the air. TWO COCKROACHES IN MY BED IN THE SPAN OF 2 HOURS. You want this? Come on and move in, my neighbor that's been here a matter of weeks already has caught on and is leaving. 12 more days and my husband and I are bug free in our beds because we're getting the fuck out of this dump. Truly, it should be called \"Dump By The Lakes\".
