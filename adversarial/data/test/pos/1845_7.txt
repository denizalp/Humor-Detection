The only Starbucks I'll visit locally, and only because it is located directly opposite my office.\n\nGood for a Double Espresso over Ice on those long days where the standard brew at work won't do, but often so crowded and inefficient that wait times are nearly ten minutes for an order that should take no more than two.\n\nPike's Place is still awful, as is Blonde Roast.
