I did not come to Las Vegas to gamble.  I came for entertainment and food.  I did not choose Salt Lick as our first dining encounter in this city, but did not complain about the prospect of eating here.\n\nFinding Salt Lick was fun and not very difficult, a breezy walk through the casino gave us a menu of potential eateries as well as a view of the slot machines offered at Red Rock.\n\nThe bread was the highlight of the meal.  It was moist (and dare I say, gooey?) and paired with Promise \"butter.\"  Boost your heart health before you smother it in fat and BBQ sauce, of which they have two, a red and an orange variety.\n\nI had the baby back rib and chicken combo, with my two sides being potato wedges and corn on the cob.  I tried to veer on the healthier side and stayed away from the mac 'n cheese, but looking back on this I wish I had ordered that.  My ribs were not tender, did not fall off the bone, but did taste very good.  One piece of chicken was perfect and could easily be cut with my fork, the other piece was rough and I needed my knife to break up.  My sides were fine, nothing special, Chili's does corn better.\n\nThe service was awful.  Just awful.  Wait to order, wait to get our bill, forgot our drinks, never refilled our waters.
