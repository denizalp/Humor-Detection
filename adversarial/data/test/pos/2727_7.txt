Hands down the best teryaki in the world. \ni'm really not exagerating. this place is awesome. i have been going to blue fin off an on for the past 20 years. i remember as a child going to florance crittenden after getting a teriyaki bowl with half a salad. every chance i get i drop by this place.\n\n the teriyaki bowls are serious. not skimping on portions at all. and if you seriously off a diet, they have double meat portions. :D    i like the dark meat chicken version. drop on a heavy sprinkling of the hot powder and some black sesame seeds. OMG!!! the best in the world.  the Panko chicken is my second favorite dish. the egg rolls are great. \n\nthe owners are always great, cheerful and ready to chat you up. i was so glad to hear this place was spared the wreaking ball. i would have chained myself to the door if it came to it. inside is cute and hasn't changed..in forever. i am serious. ever.\n\ngetting to it is tricky now. and parking is just as tricky. but its worth it. SOOOO WORTH IT
