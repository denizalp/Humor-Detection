Another 3.5-er.  I'll make this quick since football's on:\n\n~ Basil fried rice - great\n~ Spring rolls - average\n~ Papaya salad - great\n~ Red curry chicken - good\n~ Chicken tom yum soup - good \n~ Drunken noodles with beef - great\n~ Mocktails: we had one of each - mango, banana and pineapple banana.  The mango was the best.  There's no alcohol at this establishment, btw.  What good is a restaurant w\/o alcohol?!
