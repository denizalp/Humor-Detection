Went to xs for the first time ever on Saturday night. Guest list with the wife, super excited to kick back with out the kids.... only to be denied entry for carrying insulin. Literally was denied entry for having my life saving medication on me. They tried to throw it away and then called only to apologize after i filed a report for the federal law they broke. \n\nTalk about a true disappointment. Getting all dialed in to go out, hotel babysitters, flights, new clothes etc... only to show up and be embarrassed secondary to a health issue I have zero control over.....\n\nThe only thing I wanted was some compassion and respect and was denied both.
