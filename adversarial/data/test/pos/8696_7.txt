In appearance, this store looks like a Third-World place, but boy, you're in for a delightful surprise...This Portuguese market-bazaar offers lots of Portuguese\/Mediteranean\/food products and kitchenware (not to mention Portuguese music, religious artefacts and homewares) at low, low prices- absolutely fantastic for products such as tuna in olive oil (just as great, if not better than the Italian equivalent), bacalau, they even have Italian-brand pastas and tomato cans, Portuguese Delta coffee and more. The olive oils are all the basic Portuguese brands, Victor Guedes, Saloio, but be careful, as some oils are rather mediocre, quality-wise (know your stuff). \n\nThe other charm of this place is that the staff is super friendly and co-owner Jackie is quite the character, with her flamboyant Irish charm. All in all, this place is a must, for any savvy cook and Mediteranean food lovers who are budget-conscious.
