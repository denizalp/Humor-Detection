Nitaya, how do you survive?  When I come by, you're so empty inside that I can always hear the wok frying behind the walls.  At school, the kids pick their teams, and no one ever picks you as their favorite.\n\nHonestly, given the competitiveness of Thai restaurants in town and the steep rental prices for property in downtown Champaign, how does Nitaya make it?  The food is not offensively bad, just forgettable.  I've sampled their curries and noodle dishes but nothing invokes the vividly bright, colorful senses that I associate with Thai cooking.  My entrees there are often limp and sad (but maybe I can blame that on the lighting...?).\n\nIf you want to go on a serious date for Thai food, Nitaya Thai could serve as an appropriate setting.  The interior decor is immediately recognizable as an oh-so-camp, tropical-themed '80s bar, with wicker chairs and faded turquoise booths.  There's something undeniably charming about the setup, but unfortunately it lacks the warmth that only a crowded dining room can offer.
