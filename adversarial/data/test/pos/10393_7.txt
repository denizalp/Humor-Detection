Awesome, they're open on Sunday evenings. The pupusas here are my favorite.  Made fresh to order. So they come out nice and warm to your table.  The elotes are popular here too, so you might have to wait a while for them to make a new batch.  The fruits that they put in my dessert bowl was nice and cold, in season and not pre cut.  So it's pretty fresh. \n\nThey guys who helped me out with ordering were really nice and helpful. I was told to come on Tuesdays for the Pupusas special.  But my meal here was under $16 bucks. Not bad for entrees, dessert and a drink!\n\nThe place is clean, the area it's in is off Boulder Hwy, is pretty sketch, but the parking area was well lit.
