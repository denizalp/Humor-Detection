This show was a good time.  You have to leave your hang ups at the door.\n\nI got into a \"fight\" with the mother of the bride.  She stole my food and cursed at me in Italian.  What she didn't know was that I speak Italian, so I cursed back at her and showed her some of my Italian \"hand language.\"  (Know your audience, right?)  \n\nWe had fillaseat tickets.  So, we had to pay for two drinks.  This helped loosen even my uptight husband up and he did the YMCA with a construction hat on.  \n\nGo, laugh, eat mediocre Italian-American food (it's not Italian food!), and enjoy your evening.  Worthy of an evening out.\n\nEDIT: the MOB contacted me on here and accused me of throwing cake at her and ruining her jewelry.  Please note that I threw cake at no one.  Apparently, she steals people's food so often that additional incidents occur.  As a side note, her taking my food, hiding it, and another person bringing it back could arguably be a food code violation.  Perhaps, I could review SNHD's regulations on that matter.  Do the MOB and girlfriend of the bride have food handler cards?
