Unbelievably disappointing.  My dad and I drove from the city out here because he used to love DeBlasio's.  This meal was awful, and the service was worse.\n\nThe bread that started the meal was good.  We both got wedding soup, which was acceptable as well.  We ordered fried zucchini to start, which was huge and not bad but nothing special.  \n\nI ordered the manicotti, and my dad ordered stuffed shrimp with a side of pasta.  However, I hate half of a tube of manicotti and threw the rest away when I got home.  The sauce was DISGUSTING.  Too much pepper and no real taste.  My dad ate a bit of the pasta and threw it away as well.  He said the shrimp was rubbery and there was no crab in the stuffing.  At close to $20 a plate, this place sucked.\n\nOn top of all of this, our waitress was rude and nasty.  She was unpleasant through the entire meal, refused to refill our waters, and didn't ask when both meals went untouched.  She boxed the meals without asking if we wanted them, and made passive aggressive comments throughout the meal.\n\nThis place is awful.  If you are going to insist on coming, order a fried zucchini and go somewhere else for dinner.  This is a step below an Olive Garden.  The only people in here are senior citizens that have been coming for years.  Avoid.
