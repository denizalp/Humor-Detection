I signed up during their December promotion for $10 down $10 a month while the gym was in the process of opening. The gym didn't open until January which is when I was charged my 10 monthly fee. It's now February and I'm being charged $40 for an ANUAL fee which I wasn't informed about. How am I being charged an anual fee after a month? They deducted it from my credit card without notifying me of anything. Beware of their scams.
