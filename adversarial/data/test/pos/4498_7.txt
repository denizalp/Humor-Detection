I went to the location they have in Central Phoenix, as a court ordered referral for some trouble I had gotten into several months ago and truthfully this place is a joke. Hands down they could care less about the individual and are only interested in the mighty dollar, I would suggest that the state revokes the doctor's that work here license for the fact that their code of ethics are garbage. You truly are a number here. I would not suggest that anyone ever tries this place out. Go somewhere else...seriously!!! The only person in this whole place who was friendly was the receptionist.  I would give this place negative 1000 stars and pray that it gets struck by lightning it sucks so bad. I went back to the courts for another referral this place was so bad. I would rather sit in front of the judge in the central court system and deal with a wonderful additional date in court then be forced to participate in any out patient program this business has to offer, which I did so I could go some where else.  I would rather have hot metal spikes shoved in my urinary tract then go to this place. I hope this convinces you how much this place sucks.
