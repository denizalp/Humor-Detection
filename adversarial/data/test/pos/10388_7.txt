Great concept. Pretty tasty.\n\nPortions are tiny. \n\nDon't be deceived by ordering \"meatballs\", they give you 'a' meatball the size of a golf ball.\n\nI was charged 50 cents for them sprinkle basil on top of my dish. 50 more for a pinch of sundried tomatoes, etc...\n\nFor about half the price of my pasta I could have ordered a pasta dish at the Macaroni Grill with about 3 times as much food.\n\nThis place will not last. Most people will try it once and never go back to pay $10 for a side portion of mac and cheese with 'a' shrimp.\n\nI went home hungry and made myself a sandwich.
