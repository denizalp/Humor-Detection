One of the unique aspects of their sandwiches is that the ingredients, both meat and veggies, are large and chunky. This was both good and bad because the chunks are fresh and flavorful but they fall out of the sandwich, making it very messy. The chicken was shredded white meat chicken and the turkey was oven roasted, both tasting very good. Everything, including the bread, was fresh and made for an overall delicious sandwich. \n\nNow, for the not so good.  The sandwiches were on the pricey side at $10 for a basic sandwich without chips or a drink. When we were there there was only one employee working during the Friday lunch period, making everything slow down as he was overwhelmed with taking orders and making sandwiches. They ran out of chicken and iced tea.  I overheard one customer, who had ordered, paid and was awaiting her food when she found out they had to substitute her meat say \"that's the last time I come here\" even though the employee was very apologetic. \n\nIt appears that the ambiance is meant to be eclectic but the colors are a flat institutional grey with one black wall. The light fixtures are crystal chandeliers and they had mosaic mirrors on the booths. To reference a previous post about an angry blonde woman's face everywhere, we ran into a handful of small pictures but she looked neither angry nor happy. However, the use of this image feels out of place in a sandwich shop. Add my twisted since of humor with the drawings, the name \"hook me up\" and some suggestive comments posted on sandwich wrappers (that were hung for display) and it caused us to raise our eyebrows.  Also the bathroom toilet wouldn't stop flushing, so some maintenance is needed.
