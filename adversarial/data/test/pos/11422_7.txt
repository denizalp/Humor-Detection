More Seats!  Now TWO Dinning Rooms!  Enter Through the Asain Food Market! \n\nThe New Dining Room has about 42 seats and the other dinning room is still open too! \n\nKorean Ribs are a favorite Dish of mine!  Not only a Korean Favorite, a Favorite for all cuisines!  The Service here is GREAT, everyone is very friendly and helpful!  The guy helped me last time, had good recommendations, even recommended that I not get certain dishes!\n\nThe Ribs are my Favorite!  The Spicy Stir-Fried Squid is another favorite.  The Sauce is incredible, the Secret in the sauce is FIRE!  Real Fire put in the Pan!  That is what he told me and I believed I could taste it! !! !!!  That does not mean it is too Hot... While it is \"Spicy\" it will not be too hot for almost all of my friends (you know what I mean right?) and almost hot enough for POPROCK LOVE!  Speaking of Love!  This is a GREAT place to fall in LOVE and makes my \"Lookalota\"!\n\nI have also enjoyed: BBQ Pork and another Beef dish!  I took a few photos you can check out if you like!  The Kimchi here is very good, a little spicier than most places (I have only been to four Korean Restaurants).  The other \"extras\" are very good too! The Fish Cakes are the only dish of the \"extras\" I do not care for in any Korean Restaurant.\n\nWhen dinning in an Asian Restaurant I LOVE it and take it as a HUGE Compliment when the servers do NOT offer any utensils other than Chop sticks and a spoon for soup!  I imagine they may have forks though I have never seen any, most of the patrons I see here are white and I notice everyone has chop stick skills!\n\nThis is Two reviews in ONE - Part 2 is for the Market!  For the size that it is they have a nice variety of Candy and some other things I have gotten every brand and flavor of Mochi (help I did not spell Mochee right) they carry!
