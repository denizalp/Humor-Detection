My 4-stars are solely for the quality of the sound system, it was really great and it distracted me from the group of 14 touchy-feely Israeli f-bois next to my 3 friends and myself who felt the need to constantly talk and\/or touch us. Having RBF is a great advantage in these situations.\n\noh, expensive drinks and rude bartenders...but you're in Vegas after all. Got in for free due to my XX chromosomes and my friend knows a bunch of promoters.
