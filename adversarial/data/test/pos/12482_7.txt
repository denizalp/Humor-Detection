I'm a virgin to Smashburger. Apparently, they have several locations in Vegas and LA; who knew?\n\nI ordered their truffle mushroom burger. The portion size was actually small (palm size), but surprisingly packed with flavor and juicy. What they lacked in staff, made up in flavor. \n\nThey literally had one cash register open, and one person getting the food orders ready.  Surprisingly efficient, but still took forever to order since you had to stand in one line and wait your turn. \n\nThe menu is at the overhead counter. Unless you had perfect vision, and\/or 7 feet tall, you wouldn't be able to see the menu and decide ahead of time until you got to the counter. This just made the line go so much slower. \n\nThe prices are not too bad. Two burgers, two fries and one sweet potato fries came out to $31+.
