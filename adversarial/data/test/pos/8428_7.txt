The Las Vegas 51s games are great for locals and tourists alike. The stadium, Cashman Field, is a short drive down the I-15 from the strip. Their marketing department puts on various special events during game nights so check their website calendar for those. Tickets are inexpensive and it's definitely worth the price for several hours of professional baseball.
