This place has an amazing sound system capable of sucking the air from your lungs and releasing the fluids form your inner ear.\n\nThe lighting systems move up and down like UFOs beaming powerful colored LED lights in all directions to properly scorch your retinas.\n\nThey have a monster multi level stage in front of a 50 foot screen with throngs of wildly gyrating half naked women.\n\nTop shelf drinks that will drain your wallet faster then the dollar slots.\n\nCool small lounges and VIP areas with a platoon of NFL linemen pretending to be bouncers, escorting the expensive ladies of the night.\n\nGet off the smart phone, turn off the computer, step away from the gambling tables, and get your moves on.
