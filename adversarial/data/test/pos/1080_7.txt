Never ever go to this body shop. \nEven if they give you cheap estimates.they lie just like the owner. From first hand experience this body shop is shady and if you want to be upset, spend extra time and money then this is the place to go.   Even though it sounds like a great deal (don't pay them up front), you will get what you paid for and it will be nothing in return.
