Sort of reminds me of a Food4Less\nlarge, no frills grocery store\n\nwas up in the area and thanks to a Yelp friend's tip (shout out to Carla M!), stopped off for gummie bears! only 1.58\/lb!\n\nthey actually had quite a few barrels of bulk candy items, so ended up with about 10lbs of \"crap\"....that and a Monster energy drink and I was outta there for less than 20 buck! WOW\n\nwill probably regret getting so much candy, should probably lie to everyone and tell you it's for the kiddies, but nope ALL MINE! haha, my dentist loves me!
