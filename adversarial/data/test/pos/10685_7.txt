I wish I liked this place.  It's literally walking distance from my house.  \n\nThe restaurant is clean and open. We came at 2 pm so it was fairly empty.  Actually we were the only ones there... \n\nThe service is great. Our server was so sweet and nice but the food was just terrible. \n\nMy friend and I both ordered the chicken and waffle entree after seeing photos on Yelp. The dish was unbearably salty.  I had to drench the chicken in syrup to take it down. The waffle was a bit chalky not fluffy or crispy like I expected. \n\nI can't see myself coming back unless I wanted something simple like eggs and bacon and was too lazy to go to the store.
