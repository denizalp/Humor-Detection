I shouldn't have found this place.\n\nI should have looked, turned around and walked back out the door.\n\nI shouldn't have bought those cookies and macaroons.\n\nI shouldn't have bought that cupcake.\n\nI definitely shouldn't have had the thought of \"Who do you have to screw to get a good baked good around here?!?\"\n\nBut I did all of that. And I can't recommend this place enough. They have fantastic cookies with just the right level of sweetness and chew.\n\nYou won't regret it!
