Not happy at all!! We booked a room for two nights and we were told no queen bed room was  available.  It was 3 adults and a kid.  The hotel told us a roller bed would be provided and it never came!! We had to call twice to get the roller bed!  When I called the front desk to address my concern, unprofessional front person told me with an attitude that it's never guaranteed that requests will be satisfied! WTF?? So basically you have no idea either you will get your requests fulfilled or not??  What kinda fucking service is that?   So I asked her name to complaint and she won't give out her last name.  I asked her second time then she said it with an attitude again!  What is this? Motel 6? Ha!  I'm gonna try to book another hotel for tomorrow night. I don't wanna spend my money at this horrible serviced motel wanna be hotel.
