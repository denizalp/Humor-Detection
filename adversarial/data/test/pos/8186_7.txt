I have mixed feelings about this place. I've been there twice now, but I don't plan on going back.\n\nThe first time I went I got the best haircut of my life. It was more expensive than I expected, but I was so enamored with my beautiful new hair I just shrugged it off. The second time I went, my previous stylist had moved to another salon and I ended up with a girl who gave me a decent haircut, but had the personality of a wet mop. You know how awkward it is when you're stuck in that chair in complete silence! That time I ended up paying almost $50 for a mediocre haircut.\n\nMy two problems with this place is 1) the price and 2) their business practices.\n\n1) I consider this place overpriced. Honestly, I think they just charge more because they're the cool kids on the block and think that since they're funky you should have to pay more. They are definitely more expensive than other salons in Lakewood.\n\n2) I'm not thrilled with the staff. They're not exactly friendly and didn't really seem to want my business. The exception was my previous stylist who moved to a different salon. It also bothers me that they can't seem to open the place on time. I mean they open at 10. It's not like they are trying to open at 7 or some other ungodly hour. Both times I had an 10 o'clock appointment and both times I ended up waiting outside the door waiting for someone not to just unlock the door, but get there! If you open at 10 and schedule appointments for 10, you shouldn't just be getting there at 10 and make your customers wait while you perform your morning ritual and make your coffee.
