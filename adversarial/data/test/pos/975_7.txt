Bobby Fley, I've don't know if it's because of the crowd I run with, but each and everyone of my foodie friends all tell me the same thing when they describe to me their dinning experience at your restaurant.  They all usually start by saying something to the effect of, \"I don't care for Bobby Fley's TV shows\" or \"I'm not the biggest Fley fan..\" and then is always followed up by the same but: : \"...The meal was amazing\" or \"...You have to try it when your in Vegas\"  And if you are constantly bombarded by hearing statements like these over and over again, it's hard to avoid coming in with your expectations raised.  \n\nFor those looking for the cliff notes version:  It didn't disappoint.\n\nHere is the long version:\n\nFirst things should note is that the service here was simply exemplary, our server (Brian) was attentive and but was able to keep it from feeling stuffy and overbearing, and considering we were in the middle of dinner service and the place was buzzing with energy, for some reason things didn't feel quite that way with him taking care of us.  Talking to him about the dishes, his personal recommendations and even his check ups on us came regularly but he managed to not disrupt the mood of our dinner conversations.  Busers, were circulating constantly and kept refilling my water (I drink alot of it) without the need for me to keep asking and they kept the bread coming.  Oh man, the yellow\/blue cornbread with bits of pepper in it with the creamy honey butter was so damn tasty...  They kept that coming too, but it took my g\/f and a knife to keep my advances on the bread bowl at bay since we had a ton more food coming...\n \nStarter - Blue corn pancake with Barbecued Duck and a Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce:\n\nSuch a mixture of complex bold flavors, really bold.  The duck was moist, richly seasoned, the sauces hit every single taste bud:  heat, smokiness, the anise provided a very deep level of different flavors, the blue pancake was super thin, light and fluffy and in texture reminded me of a Chinese pancake\/roast duck dish I was familiar with, but the similarities ended there, the flavors totally scream to me what Flay is all about.  Superb.\n\nNew Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin in a Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter\n\nMy g\/f ordered this dish, so I got to pick at it a bit, from the bites that I got in I have to say the meat was superb, well seasoned, nice char on the outside and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was rich and sweet and was a nice change of pace with the rest of the dish.\n\nChipotle glazed in bone rib eye with a currant chile reduction sauce and a Pumpkin tamale + thyme butter\n\nThe two little rib eye pieces were also perfectly cooked, the sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it with a touch of heat.  The meat had a nice smokiness to it, and there was a nice char to the meat on the outside with a bloody awesome in the middle.  The pumpkin tamale provided a sweetness to the dish, personally I liked the sweet potato tamale more.\n\nA side of a Chile relleno\n\nA stuffed chile deep fried, anything tastes better when it's stuffed and deep fried.\n\nTres Leches Flan\n\nRich creamy texture, the caramel sauce and the light crisp cookie on top was just....  (I'm running out of words and synonyms to describe something as good)...  Each bite was absolutely intoxicating.  Each bite had a little bit of caramelized sauce, creamy vanilla infused flan and cookie crisp.\n\nSo to sum up, fantastic food, great drinks and amazing service.  The evening was perfect and more importantly it lived up to and surpassed my expectations, and considering Vegas is home to a number fantastic restaurant, Mesa grill is definitely a worth-while stop.  I'm pretty sure I will be making a stop off in New York sometime soon and check out Fley's other restaurant.  Because hell, Ill say it, I like Bobby Fley!!!
