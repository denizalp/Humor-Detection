Mr. Antenna was all I hoped for and allowed one more customer to stop paying the cable companies ridiculous fees.  Vinnie was my installer and was outgoing, prompt, and got the job done. I now have over 90+ channels in every room. I will be utilizing their services again when I add a line to the patio area. Thanks Mr. Antenna for your quality service.
