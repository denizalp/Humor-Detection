The store owner was very rude. I stopped in the store to look for green tea and was greeted by the store owner. She asked me if I needed any help and I replied that I was just looking at the moment. Her response was, \"so you came in this early just to look around?\" I didn't know how to respond so I left. Needless to say, I will be going else where for Asian groceries.
