Please, stay somewhere else. The fact that this place could possibly be listed as a \"resort\" is abhorrent. Grounds appear nice enough, and the front desk staff greeted us politely and enthusiastically. Checkin process was quick, but they required an email address, even though we requested a paper copy of the receipt instead. Come to find out, it will now likely be used to spam our inbox with bits about the timeshares. After checkout, we were directed to the \"concierge\", also known as a salesman. Nice enough kid, and let us politely decline after a few attempts. \n\nA bit of back story, my boyfriend and I had just arrived in Scottsdale from Michigan; a 33 hour drive. I am moving to the area, and we just couldn't fathom unloading the bed to even sleep, so a hotel was the next option. Villa Mirage is just around the corner, so it was an obvious, although now questionable choice. We let the front desk person know this, and he still sent us to be sold. Obviously, we're not your intended demographic. We headed to our \"studio suite\" annoyed, resort map in hand. Grab our bags, and realize, no elevator, so we hike our stuff to the 3rd floor. \n\nOverall appearance of the suite is nice, great amenities, things that would come in very handy for a much longer stay, which is the use of a \"resort\". Fold out couch, dishes, blender, toaster, glassware, dishwasher, etc. \n\nUpon investigation, we found a gross number of hairs on the top of the bed, between the sheets, in the shower and on the floor. At first thought, \"Could be mine?\". My hair is short, fine, dark with light ends. These hairs are probably a good 14 inches long, thick and black. In addition, the bath mat was torn and absolutely needs to be replaced. The shower handle and head had lime\/calcium deposits, which are actually simple to clean. \n\nI called the front desk to request the bed be remade with new sheets, and explained the issue. After 15 minutes (which seemed very quick!) a knock on the door, a drop off of the sheets, asked if we needed anything else, and left. We are absolutely able to make a bed up ourselves, but it was additionally disheartening. \n\nWe called and asked for a late checkout, seeing as their checkout is at 10am, and that we hadn't slept much. The phone then rings at 9:05am. It's the same concierge that was there at checkout, telling me to make sure we stopped by to get our welcome gift before we left. Are you kidding me? I know there is a list of guests who have requested late checkout. \n\nWas a two star, now it's one. This place is a pathetic excuse for a resort, and I will absolutely never stay at a Diamond Resort ever again, and steer my friends away as well. Could not get out of that place fast enough..
