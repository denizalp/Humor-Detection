We have been living here almost 3 years. The location is great and so is the floor plan. The reason I am giving it two stars is due to the leasing office and maintenance workers. We pay almost $1000 for our 2 bedroom 2 bath. Every year we have lived here we always have issues with the AC in the summer. It takes the maintenance people a very long time to make it out to your apt to fix anything. Even if it is something major like your AC not working in this Las Vegas summer. There is a huge lack of communication between the leasing office and maintenance crew making it a huge hassle to get anything accomplished. Our rent went up $35 since our last lease yet the pool is no longer heated and the gym is a joke. We will definitely not be renewing our lease. Which is a real shame because we like the area and apt.
