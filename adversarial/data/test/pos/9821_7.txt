This place is wack. Came last week on Sunday (no pun intended) and was very disappointed. In retrospect, I feel hella scammed. As my companion and I entered, we were asked if we came by taxi (I thought nothing of it, naively thinking it was probably for a survey), and were then told that the admission price was $25\/person for that night, with unlimited complimentary non alcoholic drinks. Not such a bad deal you might think, yes? Turns out that admission price for non-locals is actually $15 (I checked their website). Thinking we were stranded since we cabbed it over, they saw \"suckers,\" and apparently they were right. Oh well, I took a risk choosing this spot, not researching the best spot to visit that night, and I paid for it, literally. I took it as a loss...we were in Vegas afterall.\n\nIt wasn't crowded at all at around 1-2am. Actually pretty sad with about 30 or less people. The dancers I'd rate 5-7. Nice and natural and very skilled, excellent pole dancers, but nothing special from my POV. You see one dance, and the rest look the same. They climb up the pole, wiggle and dangle, slide down, click their 9\" heels together, slap their ass and so on...yawn. Maybe one dancer was a 7. I felt sad for them because they'd make maybe $5-$10 per 2 dance performance (if they were lucky). Only that 7-rated dancer earned more than that I think.\n\nPluses: nude dancers (okay, I'm a perv), average to nice looking, young and natural bodied (me no like fake funbags).\nCons: ridiculous admission price if you're a rube (like me), smoking permitted (so if you're a non-smoker such as myself your eyes will burn and your clothes will stink), could be boring depending on your mindstate.\n\nDidn't get any lap dance as we weren't approached, and not sure I woulda paid for one anyway since they were $20 per song I think. Didn't bother getting a \"free\" drink since I'd have to pay with a tip also. Like I said, depending on your mindstate (mine was feeling a little butthurt and thus very cheap)...and maybe the day and time you choose to come here...maybe the place is popping...but this being Vegas, I expected more even if it's Sunday and 2 in the morn. \n\nFYI: from Venetian it's about an $8 dollar cab ride, but driver hooked it up for $5 (so I tipped him $5). Have the cab drop you off on the street or something and don't tell the front door you came by taxi to avoid getting scammed.\n\n(7\/3) Update: my companion informed me that at the door there was a sign that stated $15 was the admission + a $10 unlimited drink fee...thus our $25 price. I guess it's not so surprising that it's not stated on their website...but I still feel suspicious nonetheless with their \"did you come in a taxi?\" question.
