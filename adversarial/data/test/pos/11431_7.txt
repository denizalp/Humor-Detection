It's been that kind of morning.\n\nRunning errands, getting things done, sleepy from working the night before. As I'm going from place to place, I browse through my Instagram to see a post that a new bakery\/cafe was right down the street. I look on Yelp, it looked like they just opened yesterday. No pictures. Hmm. I look back on IG and see one of their Apple Crumble Pie. Whoa. I'm a sucker for crumble anything. Let's go, I said to myself, you need a break.\n\nQuaint. Cute bright ambiance. Very much what I'd envision a corner cafe in France. The owner and girl behind the counter greeted as I scoped out their display. I mentioned the Apple Crumble Pie, since I didn't see it. Walnut Pie today instead as he just put out a limited batch for their first week of opening. Whaaat?!?! Bummer.\n\nI love their tea display, all the leaves in small batches with a clear cylinder top which the owner said I could open. The cylinder captures the aroma of each batch, it smelled heavenly. \n\nI sat down with my Green Tea Passion Fruit and Almond Pie, took some pictures, and just relaxed. The tea was fruity and smoothing, the Almond Pie was light and buttery. I had to restrain and take most of it home. \n\nI'm sure they can put together a box of pastries and cup of coffee to go, but this isn't that type of place. It's one where you sit, sip your latte, chit chat with friends, and enjoy. We don't do that enough, or at least I don't. \n\nI wish I could give it 5 stars, being I'm FTR. Hopefully, I'll be able to the next time I visit, fingers crossed that they have that Apple Crumble Pie!
