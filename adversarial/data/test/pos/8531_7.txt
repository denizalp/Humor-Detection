I am not a Vegan, nor am I a vegetarian. I tried this lifestyle in my early 20's and I just couldn't be faithful. I love meat way too much. That doesn't mean I won't accept alternatives here and there. I felt somewhat healthier as a vegetarian and do enjoy eating like one once in a while. So yesterday I tried Green.. Now let me just say, a lot of places I have tried like this have been seriously disappointing. Either it tastes like hydrogenated dog shit or looks like it.. and I once found a rubber band in my Black-eyed Pea Cake at Blossom, but we'll save that story for another review.. Green however, did not disappoint. \n\nEdamame to start, because I am a super fan of it and eat it whenever possible.. I like that they served it with lime. Something I had never thought to add, but it was a nice touch. Then I had the Apricot Miso with mock chicken and pan fried noodles. Certainly an interesting dish, with a stir fry type mix of pineapple, dried apricots, sliced apples, broccoli and some other vegetables, in a sweet yet kinda spicy sauce which was really good. My buddy had the Original \"G\" spicy Po boy, and it was also tasty. You could barely tell the difference between \"real\" and \"mock\", which is hard to do. The interior is super cute and funky. I liked that, but there was absolutely no where to sit, so we went outside and sat in the shade, which wasn't too terrible.. also a good sign that summer is ending sooner than later. \n\nOne complaint I do have... bring your own fork! I know it sounds silly but they only have forks carved out of wood, which break upon entering pretty much anything I tried to use it for. . \n\nDefinitely try Green. Vege or not, its worth a visit.
