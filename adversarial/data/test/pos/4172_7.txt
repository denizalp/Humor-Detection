Once I found out that HI-Scores has Ms. PacMan and other video games that you can play for free AND it's a 49er bar, we've been here twice now to watch games.  Somehow, both games we've watched have been the 49ers vs. the St. Louis Rams.  The first game was better because it was the one where Yelper and violinist extraordinaire Bobby Y. performed the National Anthem and then we beat the Rams at their home.  I also got to play about 6 games of Ms PacMan in between the hefeweizen, pretzel bites, and socializing with our friends.  The second game we watched there is when we lost to the Rams, but I still managed to play Ms. PacMan, (Mr.) PacMan, Donkey Kong, Frogger, and pinball, as well as drink hard cider, eat pretzel bites, and socialize with our friends.  You get the idea.  We'll be back for more football, good drinks, mediocre bar food, and nostalgic video game fun soon.\n\nPRO TIPs:\n-the parking lot can fill up quickly, so it spills over onto the dirt lot next to the bar.\n-check out the $7 game day specials menu.  If you don't get one when you arrive, ask your waiter\/waitress for it before you order so you can check it out.\n-there are raffles during the 49er games for 49er stuff.  You get free tickets with your orders and there are drawings after each quarter, half-time, and at the end of the game.
