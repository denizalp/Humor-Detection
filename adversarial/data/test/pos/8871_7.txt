Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale \"clubber\" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling).\n\nThe only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%
