Blockbuster. Verizon Wireless. And now... PNC. Actual conversation that took place at Lady A last week- \n\nMe: Why did they change the name?\nRandom worker: I dunno\nMe: Was it because the cell service is so terrible here that you felt like you were living a lie?\nRandom worker: *blank stare*\n\nSigh, venue bartenders don't find me funny. I probably go to around ten shows a year here. So what can you expect here? \n-The sound will be hit or miss. Pray to the music gods all day before a concert\n-It takes forever to get out of this place\n-Beers are experience. It's a venue. Of course they cost a lot.\n-Ladies, you will freak out when you see the bathroom lines. They do move rather quickly though.\n-You can tailgate in the parking lot. Country shows have some great tailgates. Bathroom situation... well, welcome to the great outdoors.\n\nA cab from here to uptown is around $32-$40. If you luck out (or have a death wish), some cabs will hit the suicide lane and blow by all the traffic. I recommend covering your eyes.\n\nAnother ride option: check Rockhouse Events. They do buses for a lot of the shows. Well worth the money if you plan to booze it up. Hey, $20 is a lot better than a DUI my friends.\n\nSummer country concert season is underway. Be safe out there kids and have fun.
