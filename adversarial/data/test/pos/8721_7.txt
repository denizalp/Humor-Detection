So, let me start out by saying that the service here was great - efficient, friendly, and accurate.  The technology of ordering on an iPad was great, and worked well.\n\nBut there's a reason I can always get a table here -without reservation or wait - at 7PM on a Thursday or Friday night.\n\nTypical of all-you-can-eat places, the price is elevated for not so great sushi.  The eel smelled fishy, the white tuna sashimi was oily, and the salmon rolls tasted old.\n\nThe fried udon noodles were acceptable, but the sauteed vegetables that accompanied one dish were barely - if at all - cooked, and the beef that accompanied the other was overcooked.  The edamame were bland and completely tasteless (soybeans don't have much of a natural flavour, but fresh roasted and salted they can taste rather nice), and other dishes we ordered were rather forgettable.\n\nA personal preference of mine is to use low-sodium soy sauce, which I was told this restaurant doesn't carry.\n\nBottom line: You can do better for the same (or lower) price.
