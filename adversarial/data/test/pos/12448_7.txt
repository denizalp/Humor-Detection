This place looks pretty horrifying from the outside. And it's in Painesville.\n\nHowever, they probably have the largest most diverse beer selection in all of Northeast Ohio. I was overwhelmed the last time I was there.\n\nIt's worth noting though, you should read the dates on some of the beer before you purchase because well, people in Painesville probably don't drink good beer very often and it gets stale sitting in their coolers.\n\nHuge wine selection too.
