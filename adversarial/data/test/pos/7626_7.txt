Three stars because the menu's hit or miss. I dream about the grilled feta sandwich. Toasted just right, soft and chewy, so tasty. But I gagged on the pimento cheese sandwich. Couldn't even finish it. Tried giving it to the dog when I got home, but she didn't want it either. And she'll eat anything. One time she ate a whole tube of Neosporin. Neosporin! What a freak. Love the pasta salad, but can't stand the potato salad. I keep going back, I just get the same thing every time. Almost took off another star because one time some chicken somehow ended up in my grilled feta sandwich (I don't eat chicken), which I didn't discover until I was chewing. Yuck!. Took me a long time to forgive, but I finally did. Haven't forgotten, though - I still peek inside before taking each bite.
