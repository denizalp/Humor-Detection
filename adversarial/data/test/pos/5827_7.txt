Sad. Used to love this place. It was convenient, quick, tasty, and had the most important part gluten free noodles. \nWent the other week to find the new menu concept. First of all we waited 5 min before someone told us to seat ourselves...okay then. Then we notice the new menu without gluten free noodles. Tracked down a waitress to ask and she simply said \"well we have rice now, and that's gluten free\". Why would I want a noodle bowl made out of rice??? Long story short, we simply walked out after finding they took out the gluten free noodles from their menu and went over to Saigon for some gluten free Pho. \nWon't go back unless they bring the gluten free noodles back.
