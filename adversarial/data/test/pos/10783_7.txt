So, you think I would get it. Even if you have an appointment, it is first come first serve. Maybe this time it sunk in. Lol! Typical, Quest. I have had good phlebotomists and not so good. Today she was great so I think that made up for the fact that I had an appointment but they took me in 20 minutes after said time. She got it first try and it really did only pinch a little. It is new in here and clean (I would hope so;) ) overall it serves its purpose.
