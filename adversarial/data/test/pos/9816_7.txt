DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY OR ONLINE SITE!  I ordered a 5 piece dining table set a little over a month ago and, let me tell you, it has been a pain trying to receive my table.  It took weeks just for them to send out the table & when I received it, they sent me the wrong table.  When contacting Furniture Creations, they were slow to get back to me on locating my dining table or seeing if they had to send a new one.  After a few days, I called again & the employee gave attitude when 1) it was their mistake and 2) they are NOT on top of things there.  I ordered my table on 3\/29\/2010 and it is now 5\/4\/2010 & I still have no update on when exactly my table will be delivered.\n\nThe delivery company they use only delivers Mon-Fri either 10am-2pm or 11am-3pm.  Which seems like a stupid time frame when they could just say anywhere from 10am-3pm.  Regardless you either have to take the day off or work from home.\n\nLastly, their delivery company had the nerve to ask me if someone would be home to help assist the delivery guy bringing in the dining table set.  Ummmm, isn't that their job?!?\n\nMaybe their services are better if you're local, but DEFINITELY do not order from them if you're outside AZ.  I will never purchase anything from them again!
