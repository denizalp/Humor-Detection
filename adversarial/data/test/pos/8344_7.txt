Our event started at 2 pm in the Delmonico's private room which is located somewhat in the middle of the restaurant. It is a beautifully, elegant, simple, well-decorated restaurant. Perfect for hosting dinner parties. \nAfter the event, we all left the room so that the staff could convert it into a fine-dining experience, which they did.\n\nThe tables were set, the lights were adjusted, and the guests were welcomed back into the room for a night filled with pleasure beyond words. The night was magical. \n\nThe Domaine Serene 2014 Yamhill Cuvee Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley) was by far one of the best reds I've ever allowed to grace my pallet. Unbelievable how smooth, delicious, and perfect that wine was. If you're a wine enthusiast and you haven't had a bottle of this wine as yet, trust me, you'll be quite pleased. \nBefore I could get into my first drink really good, our Sommelier came around our table and introduced us to a few more delicious wines that went well with my seafood.\n\nThe food was amazing! I didn't take many pictures of the main course or of much else because after our seafood tower showed up and a couple of glasses of wine I put my phone aside and just enjoyed the moment. \n\nThe service was exceptional. The staff took care of our every need. All the guests left with a lasting impression. \nI admire and loved watching Chef Emeril LaGasse on the cooking network and to have dined in one of his fine restaurants, I was honored.
