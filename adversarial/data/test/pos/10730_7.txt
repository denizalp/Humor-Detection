Well, a review of what exactly?   The chicken or the service, lol.    The old guy, the owner, John, is great, so friendly, loves the place and the people; love seeing him there.  His kids can be a little less enthusiastic about serving you, but not always. Having said that, the chicken is the best in the city.  The fries are even better.  The chicken gravy, it's yellow, is awesome on the fries.  Their fries are hand-cut, and they could be the best in Toronto.  They're always fresh whenever I get them.  I always get the three-piece dinner, comes with a hot, buttered-roll, so good, and coleslaw.  For the money, it is truly a great deal.   One of my co-workers was banned, so he would get people to go over and get the meal for him, no word of a lie.  It is that good. They close early, so don't go in at seven-thirty and expect fresh chicken, it's hit and miss, depends if they're busy.  Always bring cash.  I like that they take only cash, it's charming, somehow.   Don't ask for dark, you get what you get, which I love.   Occasionally, I'll get the three-piece and there's an extra piece; you just don't know.  I highly recommend going at dinner, the chicken is the freshest then.  Chick enjoy!!
