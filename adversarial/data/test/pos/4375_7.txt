Did I just step in a time machine back to the '80's? This gym is a trip! Tons of equipment, free weights, cardio, pumping music, racquetball, juice bar, pool, and more. $20 for a 24 hour pass that can be used again if arriving within that time span. Pastel colors and seafoam green paddings on equipment everywhere! LOL - love it!\n\nI worked out here for a few days recently while in town for a convention. Only about a mile away from the Las Vegas Hilton. Front desk staff was easy to deal with and explained that as long as I used the same pass within 24 hours I can come back again so I got in two days of workouts. In the early morning it was not that crowded and easy to get on any rack or bench I needed. Win!\n\nJuice bar made some tasty protein smoothies and was a perfect breakfast meal while heading back to the hotel. Overall, from what I saw the gym was clean and the equipment well maintained. I would definitely come back here when on biz in Vegas, and recommend to anyone looking for a day pass.  \n\nI don't know about the other reviewers here complaining about the staff, equipment, gym size, but I wish this type of gym was up here in NYC where I live!
