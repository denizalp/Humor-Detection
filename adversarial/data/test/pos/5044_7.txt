The pizza crust at this aptly named pizzeria was the surprise highlight of a recent Saturday night visit. I didn't care much for the atmosphere, but oh, the dough! \n\nBeautiful, savory, sexy dough that yields the kind of thin, flaky, flavorful, air-pockety, lightly charred crust that I love *shiver* Think Neapolitan style, like you might find at Bianco or Pomo. Soooo yummy. Soooooo goo-goo gooey good. \n\nThe amount of sauce and the fresh mozzarella were on target, too. So why only 3 stars? Alas, the rest of the dining experience simply didn't live up to the restaurant's upper crusty epithet. \n\nLike the space's previous Native New Yorker\/Brickyard tenants, Upper Crust is split into two dining areas, the family side and the 21 & over side. I'm going to go ahead and put ironic quotes around \"wine bar\" because: A) The wine menu is pretty limited, similar to what you would expect at any restaurant. B) There are at least 16 TVs tuned to sports. C) Picture a wine bar. This is not the place you're picturing. \n\nAside from some minor renovations, the interior didn't seem much changed. [Insert personal pet peeve: red and white gingham linens. Uggghh, so kitschy. *bad shiver*.] The added patio is a nice touch though, and has ample seats for lounging and dining. \n\nAs much as I was seduced by that fabulous crust (don't get me started again), the toppings were a bit underwhelming. The basics were there, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and they were of good quality, but the Neapolitan style crust just begs for some more authentic options like sliced fennel sausage, roasted garlic, prosciutto, basil, or egg (not all together!). \n\nThe service was fine. Considering we were one of two tables, there was potential for over-attention, but our guy was friendly and available when we wanted him and made himself scarce when we didn't. \n\nAs a whole, I think the concept is a little convoluted. Perhaps they're trying to please too many different demographics? The fabulous crust is a start, I just wish the menu and ambiance could top it.
