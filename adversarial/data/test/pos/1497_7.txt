The best bagel I have had outside of NYC. The chain bagel places cannot compare. I don't even consider them to be bagels. The bagels here are produced the way they were intended to be, by boiling them. It is worth driving to Bialy's for bagels. The great thing about them is, you can buy a large amount of them and throw them in the freezer and eat them at will! You don't need to drive 8 hours to get a good bagel, just go to Bialy's.
