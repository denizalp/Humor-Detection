Louis' Grille, Louis' Grille, what more can I say about good ol' Louis' Grille. \nFor starters if you go there it is a must to ask for Stan (he also goes by Alex but prefers Stan). The kid has a nose for dust and dirty tables, not one table is ever dirty because of Stan. I personally asked Louis' if I could borrow Stan to clean my garage but he's to smart of an owner to let a worker like Stan get away for petty trivial work. It's like Stan has a deep hatred for dirty tables buried at the bottom of his soul. The floor, oh don't even get me started on the floor. That Stany boy is as quick as a fox with a mop whenever a guest has an accident and spills their eggs on the checkered tiled floor. Heck, just last weekend I was there and before the eggs even hit the floor Stan was there and caught them with his handy dust pan. It's like the kid has a sixth sense or something. \nDid I mention how honorable Stan is? A World War II Veteran was sitting behind me seven weekends ago and dropped a twenty dollar bill on the floor under his seat and walked out of the restaurant without realizing it. Good ol' Stan came to the rescue! The kid is just as fast on his feet as he is with a mop. Stan picked up the twenty dollar bill and chased after the Veteran who was already in his chevy pickup truck driving away. Stan, in the freezing cold, ran on foot and chased down the Veteran only to return the twenty dollar bill, check his tire pressure, and thank him for his service, all at the same time. I will never get the image of a frost bitten Stan as he walked back into the restaurant, you could still see his breath he was so cold. But thats just what Stan does, he lets his actions speak louder than words and doesn't care about getting recognition. That is why I had to write this review, to give Stan the recognition he so rightfully deserves.
