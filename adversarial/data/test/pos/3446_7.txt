I walked into Lush for lunch the other day to  the amazing decor and a very friendly guy taking our order. I had learned that you have to order at the counter then you get a number and your food is brought out to you. \n\nI was going back and forth between one of the good looking salads or the veggie burger. Our drinks were brought out right away by another friendly staffer who was willing to help me with the high chair I was trying to set up for my baby.  Our food came out shortly after. I have to say if you are searching for a fresh homemade veggie burger than this is the place for you.  Most of the burger joints around have the frozen kind of veggie burger.  I had the in and out veggie burger which used to veggie patties instead of a bun with some arugula, avocado, and red peppers inside and I added Swiss cheese.  I love that there are choices for everyone..if you want healthy they have healthy...if you want a burger and fries they have that too.  As we were eating, our drinks were constantly being refilled and refreshed.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and try the Kobe burger and fries!  If I am really tempted the desserts and shakes look great.  As of now, they have their beer and wine license, but the full liqueur license is coming soon...
