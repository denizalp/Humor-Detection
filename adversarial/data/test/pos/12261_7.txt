Had a horrible experience at the Fountain Bleu Event Center on 4\/12\/2013!! My fianc√© and I went in looking for venue sites for wedding reception.  We spent ten minutes trying to notify somebody we were there, rang the doorbell, called, and eventually found a maintenance person to the get the representative, who did not even introduce herself when she came out.  We meet in the middle of one of the banquet rooms, not in an office to go over relevant materials.  I felt very uncomfortable not going over options.  So if you do go to this venue do your homework, print out items from the website, because you will not be provided any.  All she was worried about was what you can do with this room and showed us cutouts from 1980's wedding magazines.  When I asked her question about the terms and conditions she replied well that has never happened before but you will be charged.  The prices given over the phone, in person, and on the website were all different from each other.  She said prices are subject to change and the website had not been updated in over a year.  So if you are not going to the give the possible client an updated price list when they visit the facility or update your materials on your website what do you expect them to do?!  They had bartenders listed for $80 and $100 on-line.  She refused to negotiate over $20 and told me well you are the first person to find that and ask these questions.  I told her this is a lot of money to not understand the fine print.  NONE of the prices were congruent and her response was prices are subject to change and we need to redo the website.  After this I said I am done here and she said ok bye...did not even try to negotiate.  UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE, BE MORE PLESANT WITH POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, AND APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISPRINT and then MAYBE your PARKING LOT CEREMONY SITE ACROSS FROM THE FORD PLANT WILL BE WORTH THE $5,000!!!! Dealing with rude people such as this representative is not how I want to spent time planning my wedding ....
