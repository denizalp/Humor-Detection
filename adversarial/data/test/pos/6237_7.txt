Beach Club Bistro should be a destination visit for all pizza lovers. \n\nLocated in downtown Euclid on Lakeshore Blvd., this place does everything they do to near perfection. Beach Club boasts a cozy atmosphere whether dining or drinking. The restaurant is split in two with the dining area on one side and a bar on the other. They even have a pretty expansive outdoor patio area. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. The drink menu consists of a surprisingly extensive listing of craft brews. The food menu is well versed and plenty creative, but without a doubt, the star of the menu has to be the pizza. \n\nIn addition to the create your own pizzas, there's over a dozen or so specialty pizzas, each named after a local beach club. After much thought, we chose to split the 12\" Concord Club, which was topped with extra virgin olive oil, baby spinach, garlic, asiago, provolone and CLAMS! To drink, several draft Dead Guy Ales by Rogue.\n\nThere was no two ways about it. Clams on pizza could've been either great or terrible. Luckily for us, the pizza was excellent! Well balanced in flavor, the pizza dough even stood out and in a good way. \n\nIt's always a good thing when you think about a meal a few days after you've had it. Memory and context have a lot to do with that. Days later, I'm still replaying the meal had at Beach Club. Can't wait to come back to try another specialty pie!
