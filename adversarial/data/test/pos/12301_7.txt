Fresh and Tasty\n\nToday was my first time eating at Pita Palms, the service was exceptional and the food was good.\n\nThe serving sizes are generous at Pita Palms. Today, my friends and I ordered the Gyros lunch special, Chicken Pita, fries, and hummus. The gyros were large and very tasty. The lunch special comes with a side of fries, greek salad, or hummus, today I went with the hummus. If you like hummus at all, you need to try it, you won't be disappointed.  \n\nIf hummus isn't for you Pita Palms offers a wide variety of entr√©e selections. There are  salads and great desserts. The service is friendly, courteous, and the food is fresh and made to order.
