ok i can't lie.  this was my 2nd choice in town but i'm glad it worked out that way!\nit turned out to be a lovely, lovely night.  it was the former executive chef of l'express who recommended it.\n\ni was with family that i have not seen in 6-8 years or more?  we came early so we sat in the hotel lobby with nuts and a bottle of wine prior to dinner.  when we arrived, it was an interesting mix of people.  one table made me feel like i was in el-ray.  one gal with maybe triple g bra was spilling out of her mini gravity breaking aqua dress.  why am i writing this?  it was memorable.  does it have anything to do with this restaurant?  not at all!  but i can't help it - she was there!\n\nonce seated at boulud, the service was fabulous.  foie gras? yaaaaassss!  i have been suffering in california.  every french person breathed a sigh of relief after the ban was over.\n\nmy sister and i shared our entrees as foodies.  i got the lamb, she got the beef.  can i wax on a few more sentences about the flavor profiles and will any one care?  no and i won't bother.  we're not on the panel of top chef.  however, every time my sister and i come home, we eat like we've never been fed. \n\nso...is it a little heavy on the wallet?  yes.  is it tasty?  yes.  so indulge once in a while if you can.  if you want a tasting menu analysis from me - go onto the next yelper review.  thank you for listening.
