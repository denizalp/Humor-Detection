Update: in response to the dealership manager, we were never given an estimate.. This was one of our main complaints.  \n\nRegarding the Jack'n the Box receipt found in my car.. The date and time printed on the receipt is from the exact same date and time my car was left in your care. Beyond that.. My boyfriend and I are gluten free and do not eat from that place.. Ever.  \n\nIt would be wonderful for you to take some responsibility for the lack of respect your team showed us.  I can appreciate the fact that you stick behind your employees no matter what they have been accused of, but at some point, perhaps this is just bad business management. When there is proof to show you that your employee has done something wrong, you should take a look a at it and at least consider the possibility that the event occurred...Otherwise, I have to wonder what else your employees are allowed to do while your customers cars are in their hands.
