I just want to thank our host Mangia & Bevi for their hospitality and Chantel for organizing the First Toronto's Yelp Elite Event for 2016.\n\nMangia & Bevi has this nice and cozy vibe and it is a perfect venue for a gathering of new and old Yelpers and have a sample of what they offers.\n\nSince there were so many first time attendants and the lack of communication, I believed a lot of people came here expect to have a \"brunch'. As an experienced YEE attendant myself, I do know that 90% of YEE is more about socializing with peers and sampling what our host offers. I had chicken and waffle at Cluck Cluck and dessert at Neo before attending this event.\n\nAs I did not really have a chance to get near any food, aside from this one mouthful of nutella pizza sample. Teresa C also nice enough to offer me a spoonful of quiche which I was really thankful.\n\nI kind of feeling sorry for Mangi & Bevi's waitstaff when everyone trying to attack them for food. Ended up they just leave it on the 2 big tables and just let hungry yelpers fought it out. It was a mob scene. \n\nI hope moving forward we can all learn from this experience and organize future event accordingly.\n\nGood thing was there was never any line at the drink station. I ended up just drinking glasses of \"juice\" and chilling out with new and old friends near the bar area. Hoarding the pitcher of drinks and boxing out others....
