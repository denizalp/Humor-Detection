It tastes like Taipei. I love Taipei. \nBut nothing else about it is like Taipei. The staff are unfriendly and not taiwanese, the price is a bit ridiculous, their popcorn chicken isnt that good, but their giant friend chicken chops are every bite like Taipei. \n\nSo yes, four stars, in spite of everything i don't like about it, because taste of taipei night market is everything.\n\nOh, and there are no lines anymore, but the wait is still pretty long.
