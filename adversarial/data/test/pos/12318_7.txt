Stopped in for lunch and had the grilled whole squid. The tentacles were the best part with a slight char and concentrated squid flavor.  MMMM tentacles. They have a fantastic hangover dish which i forget the name of but it features a  bowl of rice in green tea broth with  your choice of salmon or salted plum. The broth and the rice will help nurse you back to health. If the broth doesn't help I'd also recommend their natto and okra dish with it's slimy texture it may be hard for some to palate but the sliminess in natto helps coat the stomach and helps with digestion and tummy issue's and the natural enzymes in okra that cause it to be slimy do that as well. The Japanese know what they are doing when they are eating slimy food. It's good for you!!\n\nUni with ponzu sauce was delicious and creamy. I've never had Uni before and I think I am now a huge fan. Ichiza is fanatastic for a genuine slice of Japan in Las Vegas.
