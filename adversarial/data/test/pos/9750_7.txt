Second time here was not as pleasant as the first visit. This was during restaurant week. I loved dining the first time and was excited to dine the second time. This time around I tried the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn for $5, their Fair Trade Short Ribs which is prepared with a coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veggies for $30; and their Bread Pudding for $6.\nThe Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn was regular popcorn with bacon bits and fat. If you're a bacon lover you might want to taste this. It's a simple snack to munch on while reviewing the rest of the menu. \nHmm how shall I put this ....... I can only equate the entree dish to nothing but \"Fair\" - exactly as it says!! And I didn't get a fair trade at all either for $30. It was coffee rubbed so dry and over cooked that my jaws  were gnawing on each piece pretending to like that darn meat! I dipped each piece in the cherry BBQ sauce but it was still parched and punishing experience to the mouth.\nLuckily I had asked for the bread pudding which was well hydrated served with strawberries and cream. This is a restaurant week dessert not in their main menu. \n\nThe final straw of the evening was the check for a party of 9. At the bottom of their menu it states in fine print: Split checks unavailable for parties larger than 8. First of all, the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own separate check leaving 8 people left. If you allowed one person then you must do for the rest at the same table.  Was she afraid she wouldn't get her 20% or more gratuity? If the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own check the group becomes 8 people or less. Which means we CAN technically split the check any which way. Instead the waitress proceeds to tell us she can't do that. And on top of that she proceeds to tell us that we need to calculate our own tax and tip!! You mean to tell us that a nice sophisticated restaurant lacks a POS system with zero capabilities of generating the math for you?!?!?! \nHere's another kicker: At the bottom of the original receipt the waitress hand wrote herself a 20% gratuity. Again, the POS system lacked being able to incorporate the added gratuity on a receipt and the total cost. I find that a shocker. After the whole fiasco and doing our own calculations and making it inconvenient for us diners we were glad it was over. The experience overall was a disaster but the bacon popcorn and bread pudding made up for a bit of it. \nMaybe a hit and miss type of deal. :\/\nNever dine here with a group more than 8.
