Sometimes there are no words... just groans of delight. We arrived about 12:20pm and stood in line under misters and in the shade (thank you VERY much!) for about 15 minutes. I would wait all day for this stuff!! First-timers here and we couldn't wait to try a few delicacies. The heady aroma of fresh smoky barbecue saturated my senses while waiting. Thanks for the ice cold water too. Onward - we tried the fatty brisket (yowza), the ribs (oh my), the pulled pork (a new favorite), and today's special pastrami (oh, yeah.) A couple of slices of white bread, a side of rich meaty beans, and their delicious house bbq sauce and we're set. I can't wait to revisit and wait in line again and again and again. BTW - by 1:00pm, they were just about out of a few things, so plan your wait-time accordingly. GO!
