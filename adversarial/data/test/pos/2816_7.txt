I do enjoy the food at Denny's.  Of course it is not the gourmet food you get at the high end restaurants!  That being said I always enjoy a bowl of their chicken noodle soup and whatever sand which catches my eye.  I like Denny's for late night meals as it is good food fast.  \n   Tonight I had the Pot Roast sandwich on grilled sourdough.  It had plenty of cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms.  The pot roast was plentiful and moist and tasty.  It came with seasoned fries which were crispy and delicious.  Since I started off with the delicious chicken noodle soup I was only able to eat half of the sandwich and fries.  \n   The dining area was clean and the service was outstanding.  Our Waitress was fun and had a great sense of humor.  I am already craving the chicken noodle soup and will be back soon to fill the craving!
