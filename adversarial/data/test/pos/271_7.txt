Oh my chocolate heaven...\n\nUsed the 15 for 30 deal and got my bday cake, it looked small but went a really long way. I did the chocolate with chocolate ganache. Probably the best dang piece of chocolate cake I've ever eaten. I'm ruined for all other chocolate cakes! \n\nEven my family members who werent vegan, fell in love with it. It was very dense, and not dry at all. Very very rich. My favorite part? No refined sugars... Organic... And I didn't feel bad after having a small piece. I would highly highly recommend buying your cake here. Prices might seem a little steep, but a little went a very long way.
