Came here on a Friday night to drink and watch the game. Pitcher was $12. Shots were $3.50. Pretty sweet deal. Plenty of TVs. Friendly bartenders. Free WiFi.\n\nWhen the game was over, DJ came in and started playing the sickest beats. All of a sudden the bar turned into a club and everybody started dancing. I didn't see that coming!\n\nYou are probably expecting that distinctive sticky floors feeling due to cheap pours right? nope, the staff did a great job keeping the place tidy and clean. Continuously picking up empty glasses and cleaning up after ratchets who were dancing wildly with a drink in their hands.\n\nOverall great place. Next time I will try out their food menu.
