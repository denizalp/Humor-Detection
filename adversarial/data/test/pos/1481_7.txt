Meh. I tend to have hit and miss experiences at Total Wine stores in general, but today's miss inspired me to write a review.\n\nYes, it is a playground for adults who enjoy their buzzy beverages(raises hand). Yes, they have a great selection and pretty damn good prices. Where they suffer though sometimes is their customer service. \n\nI frequent this location for wine mostly and sometimes I find that the employees want to help, check on me, ask if I need anything, and other times they couldn`t care less. I could slip and fall and they would just walk right by me, trying not to look. Today was one of those days. I popped in around 1 p.m. and I was browsing, looking at my phone, trying to remember a wine name I saw online, walking back and forth and I saw not one, not two, but three employees who made eye contact with me and then looked away and wandered off. I thought to myself \"I don`t get it. I`m not scary. Do I smell?\" Total Wine employees: you are giving me complexes. \n\nNo one asked me if I needed help(I clearly did, but I figured it out on my own as usual). I did walk by the tasting area and the lady asked if she could pour me a sample(sure!) She was very nice, but I saw her earlier when I was in the aisle directly in front of the tasting station and she didn`t say anything to me. To be clear, THE STORE WAS NOT BUSY. It was the middle of the day(when I like to shop to avoid crowds) and there wasn't any traffic. The nail in the coffin, though, was the check out lady. She was pleasant enough, but when I asked what the perks were for joining their rewards program, she said \"you earn points and we send you coupons\" and didn`t bother to ask if I wanted to join or tell me how I could join. It just annoyed me. She seemed more interested in finishing the transaction quickly and talking with her co-worker than helping me. \n\nI hope my next trip is better because I really do like this place, but the customer service is a definite downer sometimes.
