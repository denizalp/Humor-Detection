My wife's latest strategy is to get me to drive her to the mall either during lunch or dinner time because she knows that I like Chompies. I am normally allergic to shopping and the malls. I have eaten at Chompies walk-up take out area every time I've been there. I order the #4, which is a bagel of your choice along with two scrambled eggs, diced ham, onions and green peppers with cheese. I add a soda to the order and it's around $5-$6 dollars.\n\nLast time I was in there with my son they mixed up the bagels. He got my bagel, and I got his. He ordered something different so we had to surgically remove our bagels without dropping the middle part and make everything right. The surgery was a success and our hungry tummies were thankful.
