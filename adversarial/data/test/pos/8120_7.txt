I wish my friends and I had some self-control when it came to food cause we were not planning on eating when we walked out of the Planet Hollywood Hotel but it smelled sooooooo good outside of  Pink's Hot Dogs that we turned,  looked at each other and walked in! The menu hot a huge selection and I ended up choosing the Planet Hollywood Dog which came with cheese, mushrooms, bacon and I forgot what else. It was huge and cost over $9!  There were some you could get for around $5. After I made my decision I noticed that by the register they had a paper that advertised the hot-dogs wanna be celebrities like Holly Madison and Kim Kardashian like.  I love reality shows so I would probably have copied  one of their choices, lol. Anyways, my hot dog was good but not $9 good. I probably would only go back if I was in the area but would not go out of my way to visit the one in LA.  It was still cool to hang out there on the strip and people watch while we ate.
