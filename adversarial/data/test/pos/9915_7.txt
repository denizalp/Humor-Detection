Hurray for shopping downtown!\n\nSeriously, what is better than shopping on your lunch break at awesome stores and then feeling that sense of accomplishment when you find that perfect item that fills you with joy? Oh and did I mention you can celebrate with a cupcake or perhaps some new cute undies? No? Welll... \n\nAll this can be accomplished within an hour my friend because The Core offers all that and more!\n\nI love that Holt, Guess, BCBG, MK (Opening Soon!) H&M. Townshoes, among so many others are all in one area!  And if you're hungry after all that heavy lifting of shopping bags all you have to do is go to the forth and pick one of the numerous food options in the food court! \n\nThe interior and decor is nice and what's better then a mall that connects to even more shopping centres? nothing I tell you!
