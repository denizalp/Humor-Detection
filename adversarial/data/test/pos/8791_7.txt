My fiancee and I stopped by for lunch in-between classes to grab a slice of pizza. We'd been to Z Pizza once before and it was pretty good.\n\nApparently they had just opened because they had no slices out, and they told us it would be 10 minutes before it was ready. Technically they opened early, a little less than 10 minutes, so I think they were on time with preparation for the most part. The manager made sure to let us know they always try to open early for our benefit. \n\nWe browsed the local art (all 'abstract') on the walls, looked at the shop connected which had ice cream, interesting treats, and breakfast\/lunch foods, but we ended up waiting for the pizza because we wanted something real and tasty (and less than $4-5 for one item). \n\nOne slice of pizza came out to about $3, which I expected since they are smaller and more specialty. The thing that made me happy was that it was a decently sized slice for both of us to share. It was the American, which was awesome. Fresh ingredients, bright colors, REAL thin crust (nice and crispy, yummy even plain), and not as much of a greasy feeling that is usually found in other pizzas that are loaded with too much cheese or whatever. \n\nThere was a little bit of a water\/grease mixture that dripped off in the first handling, but that is just because of the fresh veggies and meat and cheese. If your meat and cheese doesn't have a drop of grease when cooked, something isn't right. This was in no way soggy or dense with grease. It was really a perfect slice of pizza to be honest.\n\nThe only thing that made me worried was a common nat or two flying around. With ingredients that are mixed and prepped on the open-aired counter-tops, that is a worry for me. It's not something very controllable by the employees or store hygiene, so I don't lose customer satisfaction, but I wonder if they ever get baked into the mix every 10,000th pizza. The irony is that there was one in the menu viewing box at the entry. I will stress that the place practices cleanly standards from what I observed.\n\nAll in all I know I am a satisfied customer when I don't regret spending my money and time and energy into going somewhere, which happens often. Z Pizza has a nice local, casual feel, not as concerned about a fake approach to you when you are there, and hey, they even warned us that the slice was really hot. It's about the quality of the food\/time without being ripped off, and the food quality was really awesome! My fiancee and I would probably come here again for a close-by solution for hunger when we are waiting for our next class.\n\n*If you want a more cafe atmosphere, the location on Central is good for that. They have live music near the outdoor seating weekly as far as I know, usually kind of jazzy.\n\nP.S. Thumbs up for having same-priced gluten free options for pizza!
