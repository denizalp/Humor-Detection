I've been to my fair share of mini-golf places, and for the most part they are all the same. But Golfland Sunsplash was a hoot! This was probably one of the nicest and well-maintained mini-golf courses I've been to in a long while. The grass was manicured, and the golf greens were smooth. All the structures had new paint and looked really nice. The golf hole attractions include a great windmill, a rocky stream (that your ball WILL fall into), and little general store; but the best part is the volcano! Every 30 minutes or so it erupts with flames! I really had a lot of fun at Golfland, and it seemed like all the other patrons around me were enjoying themselves, too. \n\nGolfland Sunsplash also has an arcade, laser tag, and race cars - but I didn't try those out. I have been to the water park before, and it's a decent escape from the heat of summer. If you are looking for a few hours of entertainment, try out mini-golf at Golfland, and remember, no one is actually good at putt-putt.
