Last visit a few weeks back was not so caliente. Chicken fajitas were dry and flavorless. Fish tacos were decent. The mounds and mounds of complimentary refried beans and rice were nice if I was respackling any drywall, but as food, about as palatable as Sofia Vergara. Chips were plentiful and pretty tasty. The end price- astrofrigginholyfrijolenomical. Broke el banco. They must think they are in the same league as Momocho or something just because the words Chipotle, Taco or Bell aren't in their name. Muy malo.
