This is as good as it gets. One of the best meals of my life. We were going to go to the paris buffet, but everyone wasn't hungry enough so opted for Mon Ami Gabi instead on a whim. \nBEST choice ever.\nI have never, ever had such flavorful Salmon, such tender roasted pork.\n\nBut hands down what gives this place a 5 star rating plus my promise to my gluttony to always drop by everytime i'm in Vegas are two things:\nThe savory, melt-in-your-mouth, filet mignon just lightly teased with butter and crushed peppercorns that is so soft and tender the cow must have lived on milk and honey and slept on a bed of buttered clouds its whole life.  \nThe appetizer pan-seared scallops that hide succently in this gorgeous sauce that's soaked with the fragrance of garlic and shallots, draped along the sides with buttery, caramelized onions...the thick, plump, soft white scallops just waiting for me, delicately seared and sitting atop a bed of chunks of crystalized sea salt. \n\noh God.
