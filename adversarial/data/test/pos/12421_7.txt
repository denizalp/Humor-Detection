I went to Vegas for Thanksgiving with my family and booked a room with MGM and it was in the Grand Tower. They recently renovated their rooms so everything looks really nice and new. The housekeeping staff does a great job because the room and bathroom is immaculate. \n\nThe bed is really comfortable except the bed frame has really sharp and protruding corners so I kept walking into it. I got several bruises from that. \n\nThe hotel staffs at the front desk are friendly and efficient. There was a long line for check in but they had a lot of people working so the line moved up quickly.
