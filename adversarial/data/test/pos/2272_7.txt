We came here the first time last night. We had great customer service. They cooked for us! We ordered the Woo Combo which included the rib eye steak. We had enough meat that I didn't need rice for dinner. \n\nWhat we like:\n- customer service\n- amount of food\n- seafood soup\n- atmosphere\n- interior\n- variety of selections\n- cooking service\n\nWhat could be improved\n- quality of food\n- sweet potato roots\n\nOverall, it is a good place for Korean BBQ
