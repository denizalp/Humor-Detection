I found Classic Cooking while hunting down another business.  The brochure looked good so I scheduled a Friday night cooking class for my wife and I.  That went well, so we came back for a knife skills class.  After a six month basic technique class and a six week pastry class (one night a week), you can say I'm hooked.  I eat better, healthier and cook faster than I ever did.  My coworkers regularly schedule pot luck's so I can bring something new.  I am blessed to have met and be a student of Chef Pascal.
