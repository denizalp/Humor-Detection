I ordered through Yelp where Grub Hub fulfilled the order. The orders have been on time and accurate. For some reason, this location is not very busy which can be great if you're trying to catch a ball game and not fight for a seat. I am guessing it's not too busy because it has a weird parking lot layout. \nYou can see the restaurant from the side on the busy street, but where you think you should turn into leads to a what looks like the back of the restaurant and in front of an auto shop. Then you have to walk around to the actual front of the store. Just a funky layout to get to the restaurant, but at least the food has been consistently good. The smoked wings are now my favorite. It's moist and has a good smoky flavor. You can get it in mild or hot. I prefer the mild, but that's cause I can't handle the hot sauce.\nThe restaurant is clean and there are plenty of T.V.s to watch sports. Service is generally average. Sometimes one of the hostess is more enthusiastic than another, but none have been rude or unpleasant. I would come back to dine in, but ordering through Yelp is easy enough.
