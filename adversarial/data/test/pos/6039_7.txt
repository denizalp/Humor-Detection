This place is banging!\n\nA group of us from work decided to head here Friday night to celebrate something. What it was evades me, and probably isn't that important. What matters is we were able to take over the upstairs balcony, have good service and drink like we were back in college. \n\nThe times I've eaten here before, it's always been very good. I did not eat last night; rather, I imbibed quite liberally. Three Guinnesses and two Irish Car Bombs later, I was pleasantly relaxed and had to kick it. I was glad I hadn't driven because parking is at a premium. That and the whole drinking and driving thing is so 1988. Buzzed walking is tubular!
