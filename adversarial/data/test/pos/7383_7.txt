Worst place I've lived in my life. It is a run down community. They have a bunch of promises that they don't keep. They have put sticker violation on my car at least 3 times. My car was not in violation. When I have confronted them in the office about this they couldn't even give me so much as an apology. The staff is rude and works on there own time. The apt is less than par and bugs have been found in the apartment. The carpet has been not glued down properly. \nI would never in my life refer a friend to this property. I can not wait to get out of this catastrophe. The staff is really what has made this experience such a night mare. Esther who is the manager really puts the icing on the cake as I could never tell someone with a clean conscience this is a good place to live.
