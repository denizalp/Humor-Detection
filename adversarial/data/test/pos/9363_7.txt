I had an amazing time here with my two friends! Yelp didn't let me down. I bought the Groupon for a $10 entry and figured I had nothing to lose. Oh. My. Gosh. I was so pleasantly surprised at how fantastic this place was! From the soothing red clay ball room to the gorgeous heated crystal and salt rooms to the herbal steam room to the ice room...it was just warm, beautiful and soothing throughout. I easily spent 5 hours there wandering from room to room with my friends soaking up the ambiance. \n\nThe dry saunas upstairs such as the red clay ballrooms, the salt room, etc are co-ed and fully clothed areas. The steam rooms,saunas and whirlpools are segregated and clothing optional. They have a hot, warm and cold whirlpool.\n\n\nAfter my friends left I gave myself a clay facial, hot oil hair treatment and body scrub in this body scrub area they have set aside where the whirlpools are and I was surprisingly comfortable being overweight and nude...that should tell you how nice this place is. :) the bathing area was very unique, with big bowls you place under spigots then pour over yourself. (Or,if you don't enjoy the pleasure of a rush of warm water over your head, they also have shower attachments)\n\nIt wasn't too crowded (we went at 7pm on a Tuesday) and the energy of the place was just welcoming and soothing...\n\nAbout half the women were nude and half were not,so you have to be pretty comfortable with nudity or get comfortable fast. If you consider going to Massage Envy going to a spa, this might not be for you. \n\nThey give you a hideous pink getup that looks like you escaped from Gay Guantanamo, lol, so be prepared for that. The shorts didn't really fit me...next time I will bring my own pink pair to wear with the shirt and just hope they don't notice. Also the bath towels are too small for a larger person to completely wrap around themselves, so I would suggest bringing your own towel if, like me, you have some junk in the trunk.  \n\nAlso, bring a towel with you into the red clay ball room...without one it is hard (and sometimes painful) to get up out of the ball pit...since as you get up your hands can sink past the balls to the super heated marble floor below. \n\nThey also give you a little facial towel, which I will bring with me next time from room to room to roll up under my neck.They have inflatable pillows,but they are a little too big.\n \nWe also ate at the little restaurant they had. both of my friends really enjoyed their soup, I opted for the spicy cold noodles...and while the flavor was delicious, I found the consistency of the noodles too difficult to eat. It was like trying to eat tiny bands of elastic...lol. I also tried the sweet rice drink,which I thought might be similar to horchata...but it was actually whole grain rice, sugar and water shaken up in a cup. It was not so good.I went back and ordered a strawberry kiwi smoothie which was delicious. \n\nI didn't get a chance to try out their reasonably priced massage chairs...maybe next time:)
