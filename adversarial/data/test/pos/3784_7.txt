I was a walk-in. Directed here by the yelp reviews. I have been getting dip powder for the past 3 months. However, I had been getting my fills done in a different place. Since I moved, I needed to find a new place and came here. They looked at my nails and told me 1. What I had on was not dip powder and 2. That dip powder could not be \"filled\". I'm confused since I've been getting my nails done and filled with dip powder for so long. I'm pretty sure I know what I was getting. \n\nNever mind that issue, the point is, their customer service failed me in that they did not even offer me an alternative solution to fix my nails. As nail techs they should have other ways to fill my nails. But nothing was offered. They just turned me away. \n\nNeedless to say, 1. They're not very familiar with dip powder so they have some catching up to do in the nail industry. If you want your basics... sure, come here.\n\nI won't be coming back or recommend them. There are way too many nail places within a 5 mile radius. Finding one that would help me was not difficult.
