I feel lucky that Pikolo is right in my backyard. This coffee shop has tons of charm, and is a favorite of many, not only in the neighbourhood, but also in town. Prices aren't cheap and sizes can seem rather small, but the quality is there. \n\nThey used to have recurrent problems with their coffee machine last summer (something was leaking, I think), which is why we stopped going there for awhile, but the troubles have since gone away. They also used to have the yummiest zucchini\/goat cheese muffin - they had less than a dozen at a time, and it was a rush against time to buy some before they were sold out. Apart from coffee, they also offer a variety of other products. I've bought beans from Pikolo (49th parallel, Phil and Sebastian), even a bag of decaf to trick my boyfriend (\"It's weird, I feel tired\"). I even got a V60 dripper from Hario to experiment with Japanese pour-over iced coffee. \n\nPikolo is a place that brings inspiration (or repels procrastination) to many essay-minded Arts students. For me, it's more of an occasional treat than anything else.
