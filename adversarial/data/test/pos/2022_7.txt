I came here with my sister for a late lunch since we were in the downtown area. I loved it so much that I brought my husband here the very next day for lunch. He approved.\n\nLocated on 3rd St off of Charleston, this place could be very easy to miss. The parking behind the restaurant is cramped and limited. Fully expect to get blocked in which happened to me when someone decided to park directly behind me while I was parked in an actual designated parking spot. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very small with maximum occupancy of 14. They have two four person tables and two bar tables that seat two each. The decor is a fusion of very elegant and laid back. The furniture is accented with comfortable pillows while the walls are adorned with various rock n roll album covers.\n\nThe menus are located at the counter and that is where you place your order. They also have silverware, additional sauces and other condiments at the counter as well.\n\nBoth days I ordered Buffalo Soldier pasta along with Teen Spirit fries.\n\n Buffalo Soldier fries are exactly what you might infer from the name - creamy blue cheese macaroni topped with boneless buffalo chicken and buffalo sauce. 5\/5\nSmells Like Teen Spirit fries - Really, really, realllly delicious fries tossed in herbs and parmesan served with chipotle aioli. The portion is huge for the extremely reasonable price of $3.95  5\/5\nBorn on the Bayou - I tried some of my sister's order and was thoroughly impressed by the quality and the quantity that came in a half sized portion. This had the works :chorizo, andouielle sausage, bacon, smoked ham and chicken jambalaya served over orzo pasta. This is a very filling option and I'd strongly suggest on going with the half order option. 5\/5\nKnights in White Satin - I enjoyed this option as well, it is linguine pasta in white whine sauce, lemon juice, heavy cream and white truffle oil with mushrooms and shrimp.  I found the sauce to be a bit watery, but the overall flavor was solid. I am not sure if they skimped on the shrimp or my husband ate it all before we made our plate switch (I suspect the latter) so I can't really comment on the quantity and quality of the shrimp. The half order of this is slightly more expensive than the rest due to more expensive ingredients I'd imagine. 3.5\/5\n\nThe staff is super friendly and accommodating. It was also very refreshing seeing them lug in locally purchased food products and ingredients when the owner came by with a car full of stuff. No Sysco trucks in sight for this little gem. \n\nThey also offer beer, solid salad options, and dessert. In addition, they deliver and take out is available (possibly preferred due to limited space).\n\nBoth visits, with tip, cost under $30 for two people. Both times I left full and happy.
