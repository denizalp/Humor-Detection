Equestrian Park:  \n\nI didn't spend a whole bunch of time at the actual park, just some stretching before and after our 11 mile run\/walk.  We started and ended our half marathon training here.  From the park, there's a paved trail where you'll find runners, walkers, and riders.  I love Saturday or Sunday morning runs.  Nothing beats starting your day with a run under the sun, especially before it really gets hot.  The trail is rather long, but since we were only striving for 11 miles total, we only got through a quarter of it.  I'm told by others that the trail run through the lakes.  The trail doesn't have any shade so make sure you bring enough water and sunscreen.  As for wildlife, there's plenty of it. My only issue with this trail is the lack of trash cans and porta potties.  \n\nOverall, I'm giving Equestrian Park 4 stars.  Equestrian Park's trail is a nice trail that sure beats running in circles to get to your mileage goals.  One day I'll get through the whole trail.  As for now, 11 miles will just have to do.
