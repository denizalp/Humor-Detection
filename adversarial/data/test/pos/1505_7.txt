I went in there with medium thick eye brows. I came out of there with eyebrows so thin they can't be seen!!! I am SOOOOOOO UPSET!!!!!!! I called them and they told me to let them grow out and they will fix them. In the meantime, I look hideous!!!\n\nShe did not ask me how I wanted my eyebrows. I assumed as others have done in the past, that she would follow my current look! But NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just take them off all together!!! I guess it is easier!!!!!
