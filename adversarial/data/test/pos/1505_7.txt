Amelia did the makeup on me, my mom, and my mother in law for my wedding and Tyler did our hair. I honestly cannot tell you how amazing I looked. I felt like a movie star. The hair and makeup came out amazing! Amelia is a very talented makeup artist who really listens to what you want and makes you look like your very best version. She knows exactly what products will work on you and she gave me some helpful tips for my everyday routine as well. If I could pay Amelia and Tyler to do my hair and makeup everyday I would totally do it. If you are on the fence at all about this company, trust me and go with them. They will make you look like a million bucks. So glad I used them. They were also really funny and sweet and easy to hang out with the morning of my wedding. I felt so at ease. Wish I could get married again just so I could get dolled up! They were very responsive with emails as well.
