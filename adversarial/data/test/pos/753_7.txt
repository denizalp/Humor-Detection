Yet another pizza place with blinders on.  Inquired if they had vegan cheese.  A very emphatic NO and a facial grimace that said it all.  \n\nGuess what guys?  You just lost a potential customer who will continue to patronize Pizza Company and Sammy's because those places know that vegan money is green, just like everyone elses.
