Was in Vegas for daughters wedding. Decided to stay at Rio for a Groupon offer. Boy was that a mistake! \n1)\nWent to check in, and room wasn't ready for another three hours. Was told to come back and go to the key line and will be able to get in and out very fast.\n2)\nCame back three hours later, went to the key line as they helped six people in the check in\/out line no one even recognized me until I said something. Even then, I was given a attitude. \n3)\nLight bulbs were burnt out.\n4)\nSome of the towels were dirty.\n5)\nDrains were very slow, and sink faucet was leaking.\n\nI complained about this and besides given a resort fee credit. They did offer me another room, however it wasn't going to be ready for another six hours! I was not going to be back in until late that evening, after wedding and reception. Nothing else was offered. \nNever coming back,
