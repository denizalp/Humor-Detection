What a truly amazing place! And such a nice staff too. My girlfriend and I went out to Las Vegas for vacation, and we both got a massage. I had never had a real massage before, but this was so relaxing and I felt so great afterwards. Everything was really chill and private. We got our massages and the best showers ever and even got champagne and lunch next to a spacious private pool. Totally great romantic retreat for the day.
