Let's state some facts about me before I review this store. \n\nI don't know fabric, I can't sew, and it took me like an hour to calculate how much fabric I would need. \n\nAnyways, I went in and wandered around for about 10-15 minutes, looking lost as hell prolly. \n\nThen this sweet angel sent from above asked if I needed any help. \n\nHa poor thing was trapped!\n\nTo make a long story short I was making, (having made) floor length \"curtain type things to divide a room\". \n\nI was expecting to pay like 150 on fancy fabric, but the nice lady at Mj's showed me burlap. Thank you boo!! It fit my motif & my budget! \n\nNot only did I not have to spend 150.00, I didn't have to pay for sewing b\/c she told me how I can cut it myself... And I did, it was so easy!!  Find a thread, pull it, cut, and glue. She even suggested getting extra fabric for volume. I had no clue what she meant, I smiled and nodded though. Now that I've made the room divider I get what she meant & it looks great! \n\nI am a stickler for customer service, and my experience was great. My helper was well informed, helpful, and overall just really a pleasant lady and didn't make me feel like an idiot for not knowing about fabric. \n\nI even used my fabric scissors to make a no sew Tshirt bag. \n\nI'll be back for all my sewing needs, and Ritz fabric dye!!
