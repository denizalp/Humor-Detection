I've eaten here a few times and it's a pretty nice place for dinner.  The ambiance is fun and the staff is friendly.  There are long wait times and they don't seem to take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  They have some good vegetarian options, however I do find the food can be a bit heavy.  But overall, a fairly good place.
