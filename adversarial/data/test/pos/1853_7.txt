There's 4 things I look extremely forward to when I plan a Vegas trip. Gambling, Booze with friends, the amazing live shows and the fact that I have to make my stomach as close to of an abyss because of the epic buffet at the Rio Hotel. This buffet is worth waiting 30-1 hr, trust me. Supposedly the number #1 rated buffet is at the M Hotel, but that's not even on the Strip. This buffet seems endless and has so much food to choose from. Pizza, pho, enchiladas, waffles, sushi, bacon, chocolate mousse, prime rib, vegetarian friendly food, etc. Anyone can eat here and leave with one button undone and with a food coma. All Las Vegas hotels have some sort of buffet, but the Carnival eats those buffets for breakfast and spits them out. Perfect for hangovers that next morning, or even pre gaming so that you can fill your stomachs to drink endless amounts of alcohol. If you are going to come out to Vegas, you have to at least make time for a buffet, but not just any buffet, the Carnival World Buffet!!
