How to have fun for under $15? Right here...well most shows I think anyway.  We went out for the frist time on Saturday night to go see a comic, that truthfully, I had never heard of.  Didn't stop me, I like to laugh, and I'm going to do my best to find an avenue to do so.  We got there and were excited to realize that the holding area right outside (but inside) of the Comedy Zone is The Saloon...a nice size bar with live music.  Cool!  This is a nice time to primer yourself up if you know what I mean.  The show was fantastic.  The layout is like a basement so it gives you that local improv type feel.  I'll be back for sure.
