LAX is like that greasy Mexican food that you crave at 3am after you've been out clubbing all night. It's easy, fast, and always open ;)\n\nFour star rating because...\n\n--it's plays ghettobootylicious music. Feel like dancing dirty? LAX.\n--there's no cover\/ cheap cover- I believe the bouncer in the front is overpaid because the club does not regularly reach capacity.\n--the drinks are so cheap- I think I paid like $12 for a cranberry vodka!\n--it's open late. We stayed past 4 on a weekend night bc there were so many people there.\n\nI have 2 thoughts about LAX:\n1. It totally deserves more credit for what it's got. Seriously, every group of restaurants needs a Molca Salsa (people of LA, yadadamean?)\n2. Sucks that it's in the Luxor, a hotel that's basically more boring than dirt.
