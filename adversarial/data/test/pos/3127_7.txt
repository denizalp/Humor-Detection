This place is a better value and better tasting than Roberto's (sorry Roberto's faithful.)  You get more food for less money and the food has better flavors and looks more appetizing.  I usually get the two enchiladas special, one shredded beef and one chicken with verde sauce.  They really pile on the cheese at Fausto's whether you dine in or get it to go.  I've noticed that some places will skimp on your to go orders...not the case here.\n\nThe only one negative is the lack of it being open 24 hours...not a biggie but I believe that's truly the only appeal of Roberto's.  Drunks wanting food at 4am settling for average Mexican fare.  Fausto's is my Mexican fast food joint and has consistently left me with a satisfied tummy...no ill effects the morning after.
