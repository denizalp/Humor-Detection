I suppose that I'm a pretty simple person, in that what I've paid ordinarily for the ingredients for a batch of cupcakes is roughly the same price as one cupcake here.  Cakes on Walnut is the latest in a series of trendy food spots where one can have the pleasure of overpaying for pretty simple treats.  Perhaps, though, it may no longer be the latest; fashion is fickle.  That said, it was with great curiosity that I dove into the wild world of designer cupcakeries.  Studies have shown that merely being told a bottle of wine is expensive makes it taste better; so perhaps it would follow with cupcakes as well?\n\nCakes on Walnut is located in a cozy part of \"downtown\" Champaign, nestled in the neighborhood of Jane Addams, Dandelion, and The Blind Pig.  A rather hip part of town, I'm told.  The shop is inviting; a large front window allows you to catch a faint sight of the delicious morsels awaiting you.  Not to mention that the smell of cupcakes almost demands that you enter, if for no other reason than to bask in the cupcake smell.  The inside of the shop is rather nondescript, tables and chairs, nice and minimalist.  I appreciate that, although I do wonder if it was done as an aesthetic choice at times.  \n\nThe real life in the shop seems to spring from the brightly colored cupcakes beckoning you from behind the counter.  No shier from temptation, I chose the lemon cupcake, a sweet vanilla cupcake with lemon frosting and what I believe were LemonHeads inside the frosting.  Delicious.  My girlfriend got the salted caramel cupcake, so I was able to try two cupcakes for one visit.\n\nMy impression was... whelmed.  Both cupcakes were rather delicious, though they were essentially just mountains of frosting heaped on top this fragile little cake.  The cake itself was not very memorable.  I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the frosting overload or just that the cake is, well, nondescript.  But there it is.\n\nSo, would I recommend it?  I certainly wouldn't dissuade you from visiting.  The frosting is pretty delicious.  But really, that's just it.  If you're willing to spend a little time getting messy, and a few minutes googling \"cupcake recipes,\" I might just tell you to save your money and just make your own cupcakes.  At least you'll get more than one.
