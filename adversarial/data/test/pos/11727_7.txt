Perhaps I should have ordered ribs or a burger with some bacon and real cheese. \n\nYou see... I like Mexican food. I'm all about that life; but every once in a while, I crave a burger. So why not try a burger but with a little Mediterranean flavor? Right? Fail. I can't remember what the name of that joint was, but it had feta cheese, lemon and sage aioli, lettuce, and some other stuff. The meat was juicy but had no flavor... AT ALL. I mean, can I get a little salt and pepper on that joint??? \n\nThe fries weren't really my style. I like the thick cut steak or crinkled cut fries. So they were \"Mer\". \n\nMy b\/f's burger was pretty good. He had what I should have ordered in the first place cuz it had what?... bacon and cheddar cheese. You normally can't go wrong with that. Either I'm getting that or some ribs. \n\nService was straight and I like people watching, so it was a nice spot to do that.
