Decided to skip the Independence Day BBQ and opt for seafood instead...I know, I'm weird!\n\nLocation & Aesthetics - of the two locations that I know of, I chose to go to the one on South Alma School Road.  \nThe restaurant wasn't difficult to spot from South Alma School Road.  Lots of parking available. \nThe outside had the usual seating for dinning with misters but we decided against sitting outside as there was some kind of private BBQ party as there were folks using a grill (not sure if that was theirs or the restaurant's).\nThe interior was roomy, a bit on the noisy side, clean and well lit. \nWe were immediately greeted as we entered and seated at once. \nWhat's interesting is that all the tables are all covered with butcher paper which serves as your plates (you eat on said butcher paper).  The only condiment on the table, in addition to the napkins, was ketchup.  Apparently there's no utensils as you eat with your hands.\n\nMenus - the place serves alcoholic drinks (mixed drinks & a variety of beers).  \nThe menu was easy to understand.  You can order your food by the pound which is usually what everyone does, or order a plate of something.\nWhen ordering your shrimp, crab legs, crawfish, or whatever it is, just remember you must order a pound of it and up...no 1\/2 pound, 1\/4 pound etc. \n\nService - staff was attentive, friendly, and checked in on us frequently. \n\nFood - I had a pound of shrimp with the trifecta sauce, made mildly spicy, corn on the cob, and 4 slices of sausage.  This concoction comes in a bag as if everything is lobbed int there, shaken violently, and served to you.  \nThe shrimp was fresh and tasty especially with the sauces and spices.  The same can be said for the corn on the cob, however the sausage wasn't anything special and tasted like a regular Italian sausage. \nIn addition to the above, I also had a pound of the crawfish with the trifecta sauce and no spice, and I have to say it tasted really bland (-1) and had a briny taste to it (not sure if it's me or if that's the way it's supposed to taste).\nAnother minus for me is the lack of condiments\/dipping sauces offered on the table or with the meal.  In my opinion, the option to have extra sauces to dip one's crawfish, shrimp, etc. should be made available because I may not necessarily want to commit to the particular sauces I ordered with my meal when I placed the order.\n\nI think this place is worth another trip back to it to try their lobster, crab legs, and maybe, if I'm brave enough, their frog legs!
