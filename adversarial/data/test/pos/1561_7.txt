Peanut butter with bananas! This is my most recent flavor discovery, and if you are an everyday fan of this combination, you will go cuckoo for it. I also feel like their serving size has gotten about 10% larger, which means more sweet goodness for you and me. It is still one of our favorite spots to bring out-of-towners.
