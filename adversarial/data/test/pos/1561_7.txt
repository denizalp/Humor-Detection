When I actually do have the funds to splurge on a healthy meal, I choose this place.\n\nThey have a pretty healthy and diverse menu, so I'm sure you'll find something to meet your cravings. My go-to option is the Create Your Own Meal. This allows you to choose one protein, one green, one grain, and one dressing. Let your imagination run wild here. This is the perfect opportunity to meet that delicious, healthy craving you've been having.\n\nMy favorite selections for the Create Your Own Meal is salmon, asparagus, brown rice, and the lemon citrus dressing. I'll have to force myself to try the other proteins one day, but I'm always craving for salmon whenever I eat here. There's a light crust on the salmon, but the inside cuts up perfectly! The brown rice is the perfect texture - squishy, but NOT watery. The asparagus is prepared just how I like it - not burnt, but thoroughly cooked.\n\nI really wish I had the funds to eat here everyday, but it can get pricey. This place is the perfect solution to eat healthy when you're too lazy to to make your own meal, but have the currency to splurge a little.
