First let me start off by saying how much it saddens me to have to write this review, but we feel it is necessary at this point to share our awful experience. We have two English bulldogs who both suffer from allergies, our male more than the female but between the two we have spent a small fortune with Dr. Trimmer in order to ensure that they are not suffering. We have been taking our dogs to AADS for about a year, and our male bulldog was put on allergy desensitization injections. Our dog responded well to the first few doses however about halfway through his therapy he had an EXTREMELY SEVERE allergic reaction. His face and neck swelled to nearly double in size and he was struggling to breathe. This injection was given in the evening so we had to take him to the emergency clinic. When we got there they rushed him to the back and injected him with benadryl and steroids. They hooked him up to IV fluids and kept him in the O2 chamber all night. This type of reaction in a brachycephalic animal is time sensitive,had we not reacted in time we absolutely would have lost our precious boy. He was able to come home the next day at 8:30am but we were warned of a possible relapse episode, so it was advised that we contact the vet that prescribed this injection ASAP, they would also be contacting them as well. So I called at 9:00am and spoke to Brie and explained what happened. I requested that they call in an RX for an epi-pen or a benadryl injection in case he had a relapse episode, she stated that was an \"excellent idea\" and would run it by the Dr. I also reminded her that I am 6 months pregnant and my husband would be at work so if our dog did have a reaction he is 70 pounds, I would be physically helpless so there was a sense of urgency for me to have this injection. 1:30 rolls around and I have not heard from anyone, I know how busy they are so I'm doing my best to be patient but at the same time there is a difference between being busy and being negligent. So I called them and spoke to  Amanda ,I gave her the short version of what happened and she says \"I'll leave a message for Brie, she's washing a dog\", so I asked to speak to Nancy the office manager and she was also not available, so I asked for her to call me, thinking that at the very least if Brie were busy that maybe Nancy could handle this for me.  I get a call back from Nancy almost an hour later and I get a bunch of excuses about how \"they are double booked and Dr. Trimmer needs time to configure the calculation for the dosage our dog would need\" etc. So I told her that \"my first phone call to alert everyone was at 9 am, five plus hours I had been waiting\"  and that if \"I were the Dr I would have a sense of urgency and take the 10-15 minutes out of my day in order to ensure that my dog get what he needs\", her response to me is \"well you signed a waiver\" she then HANGS UP ON ME! First of all we never once placed blame on Dr. Trimmer for prescribing this injection, even though it almost killed him. We are competent enough to know that sometimes people\/animals alike do not react well to things and in this case there was no way to know until he had the terrible reaction, but to have  the \"you signed a waiver\" thrown in our face when we had just been through quite an ordeal is appalling. About 15 minutes later I get a call from Brie that our RX had been called in (convenient), she also let me know that the epi-pen would cost $600. I thanked her for calling in the RX finally but expressed my upset at how poorly Nancy had treated me, I was actually crying out of pure frustration. Her response to this was \"Nancy had to tell a patient their dog had cancer and was stressed out\", I am empathetic to that however we almost lost ours the night before and she was not inclined to help us. We all have stressful aspects of our job and maybe she can't handle hers, but don't take it out on me. We never received an apology from anyone or even a call from Dr. Trimmer to see how our dog was doing. Needless to say we will not be back. We want our dogs to be treated by people\/staff who truly care, not people who leave you hanging in a time of need. (side note: I called our reg. vet to inform him of what happened and he drew up benadryl injections for us to have on hand at home for $90) something Trimmer easily could have done for us. They were not looking out for our pockets or our animals apparently.
