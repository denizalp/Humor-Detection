My sandwich was just fine. Not bad but not 5 stars either. I did not really care very much for the taste of it all but but I think that was more me than the sandwich. Otro Cafe has a five star Torta for sure and this was just not comparable. They do not have Carne Asada on the menu which was very disappointing. They have a lot of pork options but I rarely eat pork. I had the chicken and they do have a veggie option on the menu. I did not partake in any of the juices but they have a lot of them if that is your thing.
