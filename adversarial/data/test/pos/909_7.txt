Interesting spot at the Fashion Square Mall. They have a good selection of craft beers and a daily happy hour from 3-7 and a reverse from 9 to close, with good food and drink specials. They have 2 nice size bars with TV's at each. The service was friendly and the staff was informative about the menu and drinks. I would return and check it out again.
