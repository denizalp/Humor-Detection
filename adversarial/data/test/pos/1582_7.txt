Open a week and already inundated with Yelp check-ins and photos! Dragged myself across town to check it out and was pleasantly surprised: the patio and pallet-planters full of fresh greenery and herbs are bright and inviting. The menu has a focus on freshness, with some healthy-sounding dishes and a lot of indulgent options, and also some pastries and sweets on display. The food-related quotes stenciled on the wall are a fun bit of whimsy, too.\n\nOpted for the avocado toast ($12), described as sliced ciabatta topped with a generous amount of mashed avocado (easily more than one whole avocado), topped with microgreens, sunflower seed pesto (nice texture!), and flaked sea salt- along with \"poached eggs\". I received a single egg, and it was overcooked. Like I said though, they just opened so I'll give them time to perfect that. But when I come back it better be perfect, because as-is I thought it was already pretty great.\n\nService was interesting. There's a pastry case and a large posted menu, but if you're dining in  you receive a dedicated server for table service. Seems more like a \"walk up and order, then seat yourself\" kind of place. I would have brought the overdone-egg issue to my server's attention, but I was starving and even though I left it til last on my plate, I was not checked on until I was ready for my check. \n\nI'm rarely on this side of town, but the menu is fresh, fun, and fairly creative- there are kinks to work out in both product and service, but I look forward to visiting again and seeing improvements in a couple of months. Perhaps next time I\"ll try a kouign amann, though I prefer mine sans the fruit it is currently displayed with here.
