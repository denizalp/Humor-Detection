San Francesco's sammies might be the star of the show, but you shouldn't overlook their poutine. One of the best poutine I've had in a while, and I'm in their delivery zone. Daaaaangerous. \n\nMy husband loved his veal sandwich, and my chicken sandler was great, too. But I cannot emphasize this enough: Get their poutine. You deserve it.
