Oh Noodlehead. Sweet Noodlhead. Your like a flower petal floating oh so delicately on the water. A first kiss with a new lover, never to feel that rush again. But I'm a Creep. I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? But wait! Don't run away! Your Chiang Mai Curry intoxicating. Your Steamed Buns moist, yet firm to the touch. Come to me once more Noodlhead. Come.
