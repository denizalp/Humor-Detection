Whats not to like?  Easy to find location.  Somewhat healthy and relatively inexpensive food.  We all know white folks love smoovies...they have smoovies.  Its all stuff you could make at home but its good in a pinch.  Mainly, I like coming to these \"healthier\" places (Tommys, Roebeks, etc.) is the weirdos I see in here.  For people who care about what they put in their bodies they all seem socailly akward and completely miserable most of the time.  Shit cracks me up.  At least people drunk in a corner bar eating chicken fingers at noon, on a Tuesday, have a smile on their faces.  Ill eat a hummus wrap here so I dont feel so damn self concious when I take 2 bottles of Ripple to the head and chase people around like Fred chased Lamont!
