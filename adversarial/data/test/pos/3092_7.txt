Picked these guys to get a quote to remodel our kitchen because they were rated high on Yelp.  Don't waste your time.  Guy came 8 days ago, took measurements and said would have a quote to us by the end of the day, would call with the estimate and would send an email the following day.  8 days later and a couple of emails from my wife, still no estimate by phone or email.  If it is taking more than a week to give an estimate, imagine how long the work would take.
