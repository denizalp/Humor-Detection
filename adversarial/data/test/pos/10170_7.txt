Did you ever see that part in vegas vacation when a desperate chevy chase gets taken to a casino by uncle eddie and they played games like \"War\" and \"guess how many fingers are behind my back\"?\n\nThat's how I felt here. I didn't stay overnight.  I didn't do anything except gamble on the floor.  And let me tell ya, I've never seen anything like it.\n\nGranted, if the dealer doesn't know how to deal, they should probably get a talking to.  Should they get a talking to in front of his whole table he's dealing to in the most crap-tastic way by his pit boss?  No!  \n\nThe poor guy was trying.  I HATE seeing employees treated so poorly.  When I told the guy he should treat his employee with respect, as well as the people playing at the table and have this conversation in private, he snapped at me.  I stood up from the table and stated that I wouldn't contribute one more penny to this low life horribly horrible hotel.\n\nDon't come here.\n\nI don't even know why I gave two stars.  They really deserve one. Or zero.
