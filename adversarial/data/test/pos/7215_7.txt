Very very excited at the wonderful new addition to the Noda neighbor.  Tried a sampling of rolls including the Philadelphia, 3320 NoDa, Fresh n Clean and the Sexy Salmon and found them to be delightfully prepared and delicious to the palate.  BRAVO!!!  Can't wait for the continued expansion of their currently appreviated menu.  Bring on the pieces!\nWelcome to the \"hood\".  Happy Holidays.\n-dk\n\nDang!!!  Misspelled the name!  It is Miyagi's
