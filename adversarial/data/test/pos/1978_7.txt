Went there today. Called yesterday to let them know I was dropping off my car before open (6:30am) for a check-up. It wasn't until I called at 2:45pm that I found out that my car had been ready for hours and that they had done work on my car without my authorization. They also found some issues with the car but didn't even offer to fix it. I was stuck paying something I never even authorized.\n\nIn my previous experience from numerous garages. I'm used to the oil change being done...THEN a call from someone telling me the oil change has been done, any issues they found with my car, and if I want them to fix it that day as well as estimates. This never happened at Carmens Innovations. \n\nNext time I'll stick with better known garages instead of picking somewhere close to my job.\n\nOn a more personal note I don't like how it smells like an ash tray in there. Also think it's unprofessional how they let dogs in and out of the office.
