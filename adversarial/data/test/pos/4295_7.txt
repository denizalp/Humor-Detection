I have to say  I am not normally someone who jumps on the sports bar scene just because its football season. I would rather sit at home, drink my own beer and give my trucker mouth free reign without worrying about offending someone.  Well, last Saturday the Green Bay Packers were playing and a couple of friends were going to Wegz, and naturally first thought was \"sounds lame\", but I try not to judge it before I try it. \n\nFirst of all, the place is huge and has ample parking, bonus... yes!  \n\nScore 1 point. \n\nThe entrance makes you feel like you're walking into a stadium (alright that's cool) and the atmosphere was upbeat and fun. But it was a football night and I think, with the right people, a football game is good regardless of where you are watching it.  \n\nOne thing that set Wegz apart from other sports bars was the shape of the bar, which made watching the game possible for everyone. They had a HUGE TV (ceiling to floor) big enough for everyone in the bar to see. \n\nScore 1 more.\n\nFor those of you who have read my previous reviews, I like bench seats. This place did not have enough, especially near the big screen. It was mostly backless bar stools. At that time on a Saturday night, after working all day, I rely on furniture for bodily support. So I found it was really hard to relax.\n\nSorry, they may look classy but comfort means a lot.  Lose 1 point.\n\nThe menu was a basic bar menu, most bars provide the same stuff. As for the beer menu, they sold Guinness on tap. Smile. \n\nScore 1. \n\nAs for the service, our server came every 25 minutes. And we had to order the same pitcher twice. Boo.\n\nMinus 1.\n\nFor dinner we ordered the prime rib sliders and chicken quesadilla to split. The quesadilla was really good. But, the fries were cold and the prime rib sliders could have had more meat and less bread. \n\nWhen it came time for the bill the waitress charged us for a pitcher we never received. As a previous bartender, this annoyed me greatly. And when I inquired about the extra pitcher she  accused me of not knowing how the Maitre-D ordering system works and implied that we had no clue how much we drank. \n\nCome on man! You just lost 3 points.\n\nMy inner monologue was on fire but my conscious remind me; \"Tiffany,  be nice to everyone, especially who are just not as smart as you\".  So as the stone -sober designated driver, I spoke with the waitress and asked her to take the extra pitcher off the bill, \"please and thank you\", of course! \n\nThe night was a bit of a write off for me. The Packers losing didn't help. Also, I don't like when servers put up a fight and treat customers like they're slow.  On top of the neglectful service, our servers poor attitude and the unoriginal food, I don't know if I will go back. \n\nI'm sad to say that just like the Packers, Wegz did not have their game face on. \n\nI would say Wegz is maybe a field goal,  but definitely not a touchdown.
