I was excited to see that they had Taiwanese dishes only to be extremely disappointed. The shredded pork and garlic sauce was okay it tasted like someone soaked the tofu in tap water for too long though. The black pepper steak was absolutely horrible. The \"steak\" tasted like leftover dried up meat from a week ago. I'm not even sure what kind of meat it was to be quite honest. Will not be coming back anytime soon.
