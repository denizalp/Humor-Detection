I ordered pizza online for delivery with Yelp Eat 24 and first I get a call telling me they have an established 2 hour wait time and therefore I need to cancel my order, then 10 minutes later this place called and said if I order my food online and not directly through them they will only accept cash, that if I wanted to use a credit card I needed to cancel my order with the online company and call them directly to use my credit card.  I asked about the first call, that question was ignored and he repeated the same thing, cancel your online order and call us directly.  I've used this place several times but no more.  Two different stories and they didn't want to honor Yelp Eat 24???\n\nNot only did this place just loose an order but they just lost a customer.  I ordered from another place down the street online and had my food within an hour.
