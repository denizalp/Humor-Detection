BILL will try to kill you if you complain of pain in recovery after surgery. Four & 1\/2 years ago, the surgery recovery dpt. nurse, BILL, hurt me and it was so obvious his coworkers tried to stop him but he threatened them too so they stopped trying to help me. He sedated me and threw me in a closet after berating me for asking for pain relief. He put a sign on the door that said \"do not disturb\". And left me unsupervised; there was a tiny window but he covered it completely. I had to stay awake for my surgery because of my apnea and he put me to sleep in recovery and afterwards I confirmed with my Dr & surgeon that they did not order him to do so and that if he would have called they would have told him NOT to sedate me. He put my life in severe danger sedating me without my CPAP or oxygen, without checking my chart about that, plus he had NO right. He WAS authorized to give me more pain relief but HE refused. I am opioid tolerant and NEEDED coverage after surgery! He refused to call my surgeon after MANY requests. My husband was ushered back outside after he was told to come get me by another nurse because Bill had sedated me and stashed me away. Bill wouldn't let him in until I woke up. When I woke up I had wet myself! My surgery was to repair a previous surgery that came undone and wasn't healing with a woundvac; it was a risky surgery that I might not heal after to begin with and shouldn't have been shaken and tossed and purposely rammed into walls by Bill immediately after the surgery and during a crucial recovery and healing period. I hope nurse Bill doesn't work there or anywhere as nurse. He has no compassion and beyond that, he's downright sadistic! There are TWO very HUGE reasons I didn't report this incident to the hospital, but I hope his coworkers did. The major one is that my preemie son that was my first surgery that came undone that was done there was still in the NICU there at the time and I was already having a difficult experience with the NICU and couldn't complain about everything or it would appear I was just the type to complain and didn't have legitimate complaints or maybe that I was exaggerating. I also had an unpleasant experience as a patient there leading up to and after his birth. For instance they took my wheelchair away, when I normally used a wheelchair as needed at home, they insisted I start getting back in shape, which caused my wound to not heal and come undone and I almost bled out at home the day after they released me! The second big reason was because at the time, my secondary coverage was Nevada Medicaid. If Medicaid is covering ANY portion your bill and you want to complain, you're supposed to complain to them first and go through proper channels. The reason for that is IF you decide to sue their provider, ALL the award monies go directly to the state. So I had nothing to gain by suing them. Nothing for pain and agony and torment, not to mention the stress it would cause, on top of caring for my newborn preemie, trying to heal my wounds, and my older children to care for at home. This is why providers of Medicaid patients treat them like trash, because they know they can get away with it. No one is going to sue them so Medicaid can collect. And if they do, Medicaid won't drop them because they earn the state more money. A sick, viscous cycle. What I want to do when I'm able to is write a book about it, contact the AG, medical boards, politicians, etc. The process needs to be changed. Medicaid providers are practically lawsuit proof when dealing with Medicaid patients. That's a DANGEROUS situation for EVERY NEVADAN, whether you're on Medicaid or not. If we can't get compensated for our complaints, you don't know if there was a complaint. If you go to a doctor that accepts Medicaid you will have no idea how many Medicaid patients they've harmed or killed. Think about that. If you're not relying on Medicaid, consider seeing doctors that don't accept Medicaid. For your own protection!
