The friendly girls at the front desk highly recommended MP5 for me, a first time shooter at 96lbs. I was afraid of recoil and the unexpected but I put my trust in them and I'm glad I did. The MP5 wasn't heavy and there was hardly any recoil.\nI stepped over to meet my range safety officer, Genaro. He gave me a look like, \"kill me now. My career has hit an all time low, I gotta teach this chick how to shoot..\" But something about his demeanor commanded respect and I didn't want to take shooting lightly. He was patient, thorough, encouraging - without all the frills.  I couldn't have asked for a better instructor for a first timer.\n\nI have to admit, I didn't know what to expect but I was SCARED SH*TLESS. I thought, just play the role - Bond girl, badass... but I had never been so scared my entire life.  There were some people in there shooting some big weapons and my heart jumped into my throat and I am not one to scare easy. I focused really hard and shot 4 rounds. The MP5 is an automatic gun but I didn't want to shock myself right off the bat. But after 4 rounds, I told Genaro I didn't want to do this anymore. I tried it, I'm good. He gently encouraged me to try it on automatic. Just one time. If I didn't like it, I could give it up. So I did and screamed all the way through it but I was proud of myself.\n\nI left really overwhelmed feeling a whole new level of respect for our military.  What people may consider as \"fun\" to shoot a few bullets - is dangerous and traumatizing for the people that are risking their lives, serving our country overseas, away from their families.
