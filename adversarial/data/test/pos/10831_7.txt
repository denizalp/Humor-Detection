Omnia is pretty much the \"It\" club in Vegas right now. Major headlining DJs every weekend make this the gathering place for EDM fans and party people. Located in Caesar's Palace where Pure used to be, this multi-leveled club boasts an EDM room with an incredible LED chandelier, a hip hop room and a beautiful rooftop with a gorgeous view overlooking the strip. The lines do get long but if you arrive before 11:30 to midnight, they move relatively quickly.  \n\nSo why the 3 stars? Easy answer: this club gets way too packed. As soon as it hits midnight, you can forget about being able to move around the club freely. There aren't many areas in the club that aren't filled with people and moving through the crowd is a journey each time. Unlike XS and Marquee, there are absolutely no seating areas unless you have a table. So ladies, better get used to standing around in those 4-5 inch heels. \n\nOut of all the clubs, drinks are the most expensive here. At $20-25 per cocktail, if you and your friends are buying rounds of drinks, be prepared to burn a major hole in your wallet. \n\nAlthough this is one of the hottest clubs in Vegas right now, it's definitely not my favorite. If you have a table, you can have a great time but if not, it's not worth the hassle of navigating through hordes of people at every turn and dance elbow to elbow with fellow clubgoers. I'd rather stick to XS where I can at least take my heels off and go splashing about in the pool while rocking out to my favorite DJs.
