***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 70\/100***\n\nThe Queen of heavenly gelato is back! After months of suspense and anticipation, her followers can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing that she is back in the game providing us with her quirky taste and distinct personality that mirrors her creations. Desyree is back with a vengeance and not only offers creamy gelato goodness but pastries as well as housemade sodas and much more.\n\nThe shop is quite simple and charming but of course she lets her products speak for itself, she is a proven necessity for all the gelato lovers out there as per the previous shop where people flocked regardless of how shady the area may have seemed. Greeted with warm hugs and familiarity for those that have supported her, she talks about how great it is to be back, her enthusiasm for this beginning is infectious and of course after that is business as usual and started cranking the samples. They were as good and as mouthwatering as I remembered them to be! My only concern is that I live dangerously close by, not a very good thing for my expanding waistline lol.
