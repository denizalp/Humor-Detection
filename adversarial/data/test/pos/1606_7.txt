I was asked to finish work at 6:30pm and I had wanted to try the new Hooters in downtown Montreal for their all you can eat wings. My co-worker suggested we give it a try since we both finish work at roughly the same time today. This was the first Monday that they were open. According to their Facebook page, they were having the special all you can eat wings today on Monday so we decided to go there immediately after work.\n\nIt is located on Crescent street between Ste-Catherine and DeMaisonneuve so we walked there which wasn't too far from where we both work. When we walked in, we were shown a table on the 2nd floor. The waitress that later came to our table introduced herself and mentioned who her manager\/boss was. I think that she mentioned that her manager\/supervisor's name was Mark. She then asked us for our names and asked us if we wanted to order. My friend ordered a soft drink and so did I. We then looked at the menu although we wanted the all you can eat wings. When our waitress showed up again to take our order, my friend asked if they had the wings special and I didn't hear what the waitress was recommending in terms of wings but then this Hooters girl with a black shirt overheard and interrupted and said that the AYCE wings special wasn't offered today and would probably not be offered for another month as they are just getting ready and the waitresses were being trained. This seemed like a bait & switch since their Facebook page had the tag for all you can eat (\"Rock n' Roll! #hootersmontreal #stepintoawesome #wings #Ailesàvolonté\")\n\nWe weren't sure whether to leave\/stay but decided to stay since we had ordered our drinks and were both somewhat hungry. My friend decided to order some type of burger whereas I decided to get the boneless chicken wings. I was asked how spicy I wanted the chicken and I mentioned mild since even though I like spicy food, I didn't want my face to turn red and for me to sweat buckets. The waitress made a comment about how spicy the wings were and if I really liked spicy, I should go for something more spicy. I opted to stay with my choice of mild.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the waitress came back and apologized for how long it was taking for our orders but it didn't really seem that long in my opinion. I can't comment on what my friend thought in terms of the wait but I don't believe that he was bothered either and we both appreciated the waitress coming to tell us that our order would be ready in a few more minutes.\n\nWhen she came back with our orders, my friend offered me one of the curly fries from his burger so I tried it. I had eaten a few pieces of my boneless chicken wings and I offered him one piece as well. He tried it and wasn't overly impressed by it. I wasn't overly impressed by it either. When I chewed it, it had the same texture as me chewing fat. It wasn't crispy. It was soggy\/moist for the most part. I would compare it to very soggy General Tao chicken or chewing fat. When I mentioned to my friend that it had the same texture as chewing fat, he agreed. I cut a piece of my boneless chicken wing just to see what was inside the batter and there was chicken in it.\n\nAnother waitress came to our table and started to talk to us. She asked us if we spoke English or French and then asked us where we were from. We both mentioned that we were from Montreal and just finished work so decided to give this place a try. She then asked if it was the first time we were at a Hooters location and both of us said that it wasn't. My friend mentioned that he had gone to the one on the South Shore and I mentioned that I've been to the one on the South Shore as well as one in the US. She then made a comment about the Hooters in the South Shore that my friend and I didn't respond to but given that both places might have the same owner\/franchisee it didn't sound right.\n\nI'm not sure if my friend's burger was supposed to come in a bun but his burger was actually between 2 pieces of toasted bread which I found unusual since most of the pictures that I saw on the menu showed a burger bun.\n\nThe waitress asked what I thought of the food and I mentioned that I wasn't overly impressed with my boneless chicken wings. She mentioned that I should have picked a different dipping sauce or level of spicy but I mentioned I didn't like the way the chicken was done\/cooked which had nothing to do with the sauce or how spicy it was. When we were ready to leave, the waitress came and asked if we wanted 1 or 2 bills and we indicated 2 bills. She brought the credit card machine and for some reason, the machine had issues reading both my friend's credit card as well as my own.\n\nI found the service and the ladies to be very nice and polite. I wasn't sure what led to the comment from the waitress regarding the Hooters in the South Shore. I wasn't impressed by my boneless chicken wings nor for advertising on their Facebook page #Ailesàvolonté but not having it (seemed like a B&S) so I am rating them 2 stars.
