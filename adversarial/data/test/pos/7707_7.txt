this post office has been a favorite of mine for many a year. but since they started routing my undeliverable packages to the fucking Van Buren Post Office i have been pissed off. i do not know why i need to go so god damn far just to find out i got a new chotchkey from Camel that was too big to fit in my mail box. waste my time. i want a refund..maybe even a complimentary roll of stamps.\n\nprobably one of the cooler post offices to get a PO Box at..except you will have no access to your mail after 6pm. \n\ni have to rate it 2 stars simply on the fact it USED to be better. now it's only Meh!
