Under Armour - Las Vegas North Premium Outlet\n\nThis is one of my favorite Under Armour's to shop at in Las Vegas.  The store is average size compared to the rest of the Under Armours that I have been to, but larger than the South Premium Outlet location.  This location has a decent selection of UA heat gear and golf shirts.  The shoe selection is pretty good too.  What sets this Under Armour from the rest that I have shopped at is the deals.  This location always has deals, especially during the holiday's when most of their stuff is marked down at least 40%. The men's clothing is located to the right, women's to the left, and shoes in the middle.  Accessories are found at the front-end\/register area.  As for service, you need to initiate the service and reach out for a team member if assistance is needed.  \n\nTIP: Check out the clearance area.  It's not uncommon to find deals 75% off retail.
