Considering that a surgical center is never going to be a fun experience, Piper surgery center did manage to make it as pleasant as possible.  I was first pleased with the minimal time spent in the waiting room.  Usually, when I see a doctor of any kind, I spend more time in the waiting area than the exam room. But they literally had me checked in only 5 minutes after my arrival.\n\nThey have a security guard that personally takes your valuables (rings, keys, credit cards, etc) and locks them up for safe keeping and piece of mind (because of course they are not responsible).\n\nTheir gowns are typical hospital gowns at first sight. However, they actually have a ventilation system that blows air into them.  You are given a remote to control the temperature of this air.  Unfortunately, I was unknowingly laying on this remote and thus unaware of its existence...the air blowing into my gown was very warm. At first, this pleased me because I  typically run cold and it was nice to feel warmth.  But, after 10 minutes, it became extremely hot and sweaty under my gown, and I started to feel concerned about potentially emitting unappealing body odors.  But the nurses are so friendly that I was not embarrassed for more than one second after they laughed and showed me how to adjust my air flow.  The air can become quite cold, very fast, so be careful.\n\nThe best part though was the end.  At Piper, they are very eager to get rid of you.  I awoke in a little bit of pain, and a lot of fog, to have my previously locked up valuables placed on my chest and a nurse handing me my underwear.  There is very little time for moaning or groaning - they call your ride (if they are not in the waiting room) and before you can even tell what is really going on, you are seated in the car and on your way home.  Or, in my case, to the Chik Filet drive cone for a vanilla soft serve ice cream cone. \n\nThere is also a very cute man nurse.\nNot sure if this is a positive or negative thing when you are overheating a backless gown though!
