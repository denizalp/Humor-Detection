Sometimes awesome sometimes not so much.\n\nWhen it's packed you might as well just come back some other time.  Between finding a parking spot and getting on a piece of equipment or a bench you better pray your pre workout won't wear off. \n\nI've worked with Kayce Gorman and Fit2figure and she's great.  Her fiancee Doug with Lang fitness seems like a good trainer option as well. some trainers and they're clients don't play well with others. There's a lot of tude, selfies, and looking in the mirror. Bro if you're really working hard then just lift and get work done!\n\nLike the variety of equipment and the stretch of artificial turf.  Sometimes the gym smells like a gym bag.
