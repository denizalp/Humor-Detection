If I could I would give it negative stars. We talked to the manager at the mesa store and told him we were redoing our kitchen. They were going to come take the cabinets and counter tops out but couldn't get to it in time, so I removed all the cabinets and counter tops myself. I loaded everything on a trailer so we could take them there. We told him that one of the cabinets (sink) had water damage. They said no problem bring them by. When we got there to unload the cabinets Bob looked at them and said the he doesn't know why we brought them down and said they would trash them anyway. He was very rude and acted like we were troubling him to do his job. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED with my whole experience with them. Would rather take all my stuff to the dump than back there.
