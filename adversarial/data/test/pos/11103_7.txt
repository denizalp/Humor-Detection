Went here for lunch Saturday afternoon with a party of 4.  I've been here about a zillion times yet this is my first review.\n\nI really hate going here but I love to eat here.  Let me explain:  The parking situation is a complete clusterfuq as is the ordering and seating process.  It is basically a yuppy free-for-all in the place.  The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that, the ordering your food and picking it up process is pretty haphazard and is not helped by tons of people trying to make their way through the place filled with shelves of random stuff.\n\nHOWEVER.....\n\nEVERYTHING and I do mean EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious.  Breakfast to lunch and everything in between is excellent.  You really cannot go wrong.  Even their pre-made salads are excellent.  Their menu is not too complicated but it is very well thought out and I bet they have some of your favorites, but with their special twist.  Anyway, everything is top notch.
