What an amazing experience!!! The tech was kind, courteous, and very respectful. They truly catered to my needs and I would refer them to my mother. I did end up signing the agreement a few years back and have been very pleased with all the techs. They have all explained things to me in \"English\" so it's easy for me to understand. Thanks a lot DVA!!
