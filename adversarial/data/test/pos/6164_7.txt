I never had a need to go to the M Resort because it is so far out of town for me but I was invited to attend the Nevada Donor Awards Gala in October so I decided to attend. As most casinos go, plenty of slots and tables to play. The interior is pretty and reminds me a lot of The Red Rock Hotel and Casino in terms of design and layout. The ballrooms are large and roomy and the pool area is pretty and comfortable. Overall I would not have a need to stay here, but if I was traveling through and needed a place to crash I would probably consider staying here. It is very convenient to the I-15 and more upscale then your average roadside motel!
