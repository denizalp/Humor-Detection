I have to give a 4 star only because it was so miserably hot inside the restaurant. The food was amazing, service was average but it's hotter inside the restaurant than outside which makes you feel awful while eating . My party of and I were all sweating like crazy asking our server to turn up the air, but there was no change in the environment. I guess go in the evening when it's dark out since you get any air during the day.
