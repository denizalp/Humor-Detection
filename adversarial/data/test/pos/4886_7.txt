What a disappointment. I've watched Pawn Stars for years and thought this would be a fun thing to do and see. We took the monorail to the end of the line and was lucky to find a taxi to take us the remainder of the way. We arrived about 8:45 and there was a line of 30+ people already! I thought it was open 24 hours a day but learned in line that the doors open at 9am for people to shop\/see as the rest of the time its only open for people to pawn\/sell.\n\nWe heard that there can be a wait sometimes 2-3 hours! I would have been very ticked off if I had waited that long to get in after I saw what was inside.  This place is a dump! The items in the cases are not displayed well, the cheesy signs \"Item featured on Pawn Stars\" are handwritten on dirty looking paper. The items that were in the case were so overpriced, you could buy them new for the same amount. \n\nDo not waste your time and taxi money to come here! You will not see any of the Pawn Stars crew - we were told they come in early in the morning and leave before 9am unless they are filming.
