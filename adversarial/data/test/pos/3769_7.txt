Kierland Commons is SO festive this time of year! {Holiday Season}. I got there on Saturday night, 12\/10 around 5 PM and Mrs. Claus was storytelling + singing, they had a live holiday band, Santa, s'mores, and a snowfall every hour, on the hour until 8 PM! The kiddos were having an absolute blast and families were so happy! They have wonderful restaurants on site so it makes for a perfect family outing + festive experience for everyone! \n\nOn regular days, it is great for shopping! They have stores that are sure to tickle everyone's fancy. The only reason for my four stars is that it is an outdoor mall so for 5 months out of the year, it is pretty toasty to shop around outside! Other than that, I love it! I've also never had a problem parking there. \n\nI'm going back again this week for dinner and am looking forward to more festive fun! I also can't wait until I have kids someday so that they can experience it too!
