I'm addicted to HomeGoods!\nCame here last week for the first time and found a bunch of awesome pieces for my bedroom and dog.\nCame back again today and found more great finds!\nMy favorite place to shop for house items!\nI may be tempted to come back every week until I get my fix!\nHomegoods you got me good!\n+ dog friendly! Love bringing my puppy with me!\nI'm a super fan!\n-Miss Yelp 2012
