Absolutely fantastic.  A very thorough massage.  Angel is really nice, gave us an appointment right away, and my wife and I both got fantastic massages and left very relaxed.\n\nYou get a full body massage in phases, first your neck, head, lower back, then your feet, and legs, then you lie down and they do a full body back massage.  You keep your clothes on and in your a dark quiet room.  Totally on the up and up and a great deal. \n\nWhen I'm in Vegas again, I'll definitely stop by.  Very relaxing
