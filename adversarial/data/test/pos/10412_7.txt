Holy eff.\nThis is probably the best burger I've ever had.\nAnd I'm not an easy girl to please!\n\n\nMy boyfriend mentioned passing this place during the 'long way' home from work one Friday night. \n\nWe got into his car around 8pm, and drove all the way to Etobicoke - living downtown (King\/Brant), we felt like slight traitors, traveling to the 'other' end of the city ... but my lord!\nIt was worth it! \n\nThe sliders, and tiny perfect little things of perfection ... the fries don't disappoint & even the onion rings are spot on. Neither were soggy messes by the time we got home.  \n\nI did push the envelope on this one, and even tried a homemade chocolate shake, that left me moaning .. and my boyfriend wondering what the hell he had just ordered for me! \n\nWhile one of the owners (I asked him, who he was) looks like a total Jersey Shore douche bag, this dude sure can deliver on a good burger & fries!\n\nI'll be going back to Sliders. No doubt, yo!
