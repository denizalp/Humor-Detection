I do watch the show when I was in Vegas I stopped in I was hoping Rick the owner was there i would have liked to talk to him an let him know that he gives employers a BAD name the way his employee does what he dam well pleases mainly chumlee maybe that's done for the show it makes Rick look like a wimp. When I was leaving chumlee came in I shook his hand told him  \nwhat I see when i watch the show that you are one lazy sob\n I don't think he knows what work really is .
