This is my favourite pho place in Toronto. It has a great location right outside of the ROM and another one in Chinatown.\n\nThe portions are regularly sized for pho and the prices are great. (If you're a U of T student and you pay cash, show your t-card and you get 10% off!)\n\nMy go-to pho is 08 because I love the beef balls but all the meat is pretty good. They give you a decent amount too. The soup is not too oily and pretty flavorful. It's not always as hot as I like it but it's not bad. The noodles are well cooked and the meat and vegetables are pretty fresh. I recommend the spring rolls as well. They're fairly big and delicious when they come out hot and crispy.\n\nService is not great, but most pho places are run this way. If you become a regular like me, they'll treat you great. The owner is super friendly.\n\nI heard this place is closing down because of the condos though. :( You must try it before that!
