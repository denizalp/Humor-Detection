I used to visit Zeffirino's quite often when I worked at the Grand Canal.  I miss my weekly lunch there now that I am a stay at home mommy, but I do get down there from time to time.  \n\nIt is a lovely restaurant tucked away from the crazy crowds of the mall.  The menu is diverse and is very much like the food I had in Italy once upon a time.  Every time I have been there, the servers are all Italian too, or have a very good fake accents, but either way, they make it fun to dine here.  I mean what girl doesn't like a cute waier with an Italian accent??? The portions on the entrees are big, so make sure you go hungry!  \n\nAlso make reservations ahead of time and request to be seating near the windows,s o you can look out at the mall and the Grand Canal below.  You can even pretend you are in Venice, awwwww.
