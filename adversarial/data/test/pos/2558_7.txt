Stayed at the Venetian over the weekend, so I guess we had to come try this place out.   Wasn't due to yelp this time, my friends just wanted to stop by.  \n\nCame here at 2pm on Friday with 3 of my friends, the place was not too busy.  But 20mins wait for the waitress to take our order was not cool.  Also the food took extremely long to get to us.  We must waited atleast another 20mins.  I ordered the Shrimps with pasta, the plate was $20 and it was excellent.  The food was quality was pretty good overall from trying out my friends dishes.  \n\nI don't know why the it took so long to serve us, really can't give this place anything above a 3star because of the wait.
