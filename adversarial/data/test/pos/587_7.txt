If there is one thing I loathe is taking my car in for its regular oil change. I will push my engine to the far slide of the slash, as often as I can if it saves me another couple of days. However, this is not because I hate the process or the chore of going, no no, what's turned me off is the pushy, pricey mechanics and dealerships that I have to deal with every time my oil light comes on.\n\nEver searching for an answer to the $60 starting price at my local Jeep-Dodge dealership or the 35km drive to my regular mechanic I found myself caught between a gas cap and an oil plug! (Best car analogy I could think of off the top of my head - perhaps piston and a fiery place would be more appropriate?). This was until recently when a local Penny gas station in turned its pumps off and the space was cleaned up and taken over by new owners, opening York Region Automotive. \n\nMy pops was the first person to tell me about the place, so I need to credit him with the discovery. Located conveniently on the East side of Yonge street just a 1\/4 mile north of King Road (if that far). Its a single car garage on a large lot, so if you need extended service its best to make an appointment in advance.\n\nThis has become my new spot for all of my automotive service needs not just because of its convenient proximity to my home, but because of the honesty, and customer service provided by the staff AND the prices!!\n\nEveryone knows the only thing harder to find than an honest lawyer is an honest mechanic, and these guys are just that. They tell me exactly what needs to be done, what can wait and the most cost effective ways to fix a problem. My regular oil, lube and filter comes to $35 taxes in (approximately), what a bargain. Also their attention to detail is amazing, recently they caught 3 finishing nails logged in my tire and to the naked eye your could barely see them. Instead of recommending a full tire swap, they suggested a couple of inexpensive plugs that would not only hold but keep my tire turning until they were ready for a change - and for $20, why not!\n\nAside from their honesty their customer service is tops, they allow me to stand in the bay as they work (at a safe distance from the car of course) and ask as many question as I want about the service their doing. I feel totally comfortable with them. Also, they're pretty funny guys in there and the non-auto chatter can get pretty entertaining.\n\nObviously this place is a little north for my Toronto pals, BUT if you ever find your way up to cottage country and need a quick oil change, hop off the 400 at King Rd and drive east until it ends. York Region Automotive is there and I gurantee you'll be back on the road with money in your pocket and a smile on your face in no time.
