Order a plate of their beautiful pumpkin and specify you want it à la Raj Basdeo with the roti on the side. Don't forget to keep it real and eat with your hands. This food tastes better without utensils. Welcome to Guyana! I am ethnically half Indo-Guyanese-Canadian and half Québécois so that makes me the lucky grandson of my amazing Nana who stuffs me to the brim with her excellent cooking about once or twice a week. Even though I have never set foot in Guyana or seen the swaying palms under the Caribbean sun I have grown up with, am genetically predisposed to and was born and bred with Indo-Guyanese flavours coursing through my being. For those of you without an Indian grandma there is Caraïbe Délite! I'm so glad this place exists. This is absolutely authentic Indo-Guyanese home cooking. The dal soup is a must! Just as equally incredible is the pulourie which is a beautifully golden savoury fritter made from chickpeas flour; it is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and perfection all around. Try the authentically and extremely hot Guyanese pepper sauce. It is made specially from the Scotch Bonnet peppers that grow in the proprietor's home garden. Never tell my Nana this but this place totally makes roti and dal puris a little better than she does at home. I died a little bit inside by saying that but alas, it is true. I love my grandmother very much; thankfully she's not on Yelp. You also need to try the curried chickpeas and potato. They serve it wrapped up inside of a roti usually but I like to order mine on the side in order to eat my meal in a more traditional manner. They have excellent homemade Caribbean beverages as well. Try the mauby which is a non-alcoholic drink brewed from the bark of the Colubrina arborescens tree. It is a bit like sarsaparilla with an aniseed twist. Sweet yet bitter yet refreshing. If you've had a long day basking in the summer sun and smoke of the Tamtams and you're getting hungry or if winter seems a tad bleak take a jaunt over to the Caribbean and have yourself a treat. Come on in, man, the water is warm and you can feel the sea breeze on your taste buds.
