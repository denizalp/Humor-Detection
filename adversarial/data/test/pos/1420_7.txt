Absolutely unprofessional. Complete dental apparently bought Dr. Brannan's practice after he retired. If you are thinking of giving them a shot. . DON'T.  I was there 30 minutes prior to my appointment to fill in the required paperwork. I was the only person in the waiting room waited 45 minutes after the appointment time in the meantime the doctor walked in a few times in the waiting area and back into the rooms. During that time nobody came to see me or to let me know when I'll be taken in so I was in the office sofar 1 hour and 15 minutes. I'm not sure if they overbook their schedule but what I know is, Dr Brennan worked with only 2 assistants and 1 receptionist and took people always on time. Complete dental head 3 receptionist and I guess even though this in slow too many patients for them to be able to take care of all of them. Well I was there gentleman came in to fix an error that have done about his insurance. After all this time I asked to reschedule nobody apologised and after that I just asked for my paperwork and I left. I will not be going back and don't recommend anyone this office.
