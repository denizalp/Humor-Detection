Unprofessional! Immature! Unreliable! A-Hole! Do not use!  \nI reach out to Eric for a quote & a meeting. He doesn't follow up (OK he's busy I get it), so I call & ask to meet at my home that day.  He agrees.  He texts me to say he would be at the house in 20 min. I txt back saying I was grabbing a quick take out lunch & would be back in 20-25. I'm driving back & he starts texting that he is leaving so I say fine.  Then he called me & starts swearing & calling me names. Awesome. Have never seen a guys scream at a customer that he is trying to sell a job too. Unprofessional! Immature! Unreliable!  A-Hole!
