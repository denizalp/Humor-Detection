Um.... A communist themed bar on a subzero Calgary evening? Obviously. Part kitsch\/part throwback to the days of loungey chic before gastro pubs conquered the universe. There is a thorough martini menu with theme named drinks. We tried 3 of them, and they were pretty good... And stiff.\nThe Asian fusion cuisine was decent but nothing to brag about.\nThe star attraction here is the bizarre theme and eclectic patrons it attracts, from tatted hipsters to the young, pretty, and chic. If I lived in the neighborhood, I probably would not be a regular. Definitely a place you have to check out once, though. When you do, have a Lee Harvey Oswald for me.
