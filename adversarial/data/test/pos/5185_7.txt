Lizeth was amazing. \n\nShe's hilarious and actually taught me a thing or two about taxes throughout the process.\n\nI ended up getting about $400 more than what turbo tax would have gotten me!\n\nDefinitely go to her and you won't be disappointed!\n\nAnd mention that Ricky referred you cause we both get $25 off!
