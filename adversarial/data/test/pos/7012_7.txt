I was blackmailed by Manager Angelo to put in a good remark about my over all experience with my pool I bought with them In order to receive a 500 dollar in store credit at the store on Shea Blvd in Scotsdale, Az. Even though my personal experience was the absolute worst. No returned phone calls. Never on time for anything. Post phoned apt times from one day to next. Even from one week to next and month to month and so on. My pool was way over due when promised it would only be 3 months. My plaster came out horrible with trowel marks every where. My color I picked for the plaster is completely different. My drain doesnt work properly and my waterfall isn't completed. I went in recently on Thursday May 28th 2015 to finally get answers to the Scotsdale location from ANGELO since I got no returned phone calls or emails. I spoke with Kathy who told me Angelo wasn't there. I tried  to collect my 500 dollar in store credit and was told it's not even in system. I have been betrayed and lied to by Angelo. It turns out that after a few minutes trying to get answers from Kathy she finally came out with the truth that the company is going down under. No more employees or staff are there. She explained that she hasn't even received a pay check yet. Now I'm stuck with trying to resolve all my issues. Advice to others. Never trust anyone. I should have saw hints that this company was going down under when nobody returned my phone calls. I have been taken advantage of and now plan on legal action against Paddock or Cameo Pools.
