At home in Toronto, I drink Van Houtte coffee all the time. I always thought it would be nice to have a Van Houtte cafe in Toronto, but after visiting some of them in Montreal, I've changed my mind.\n\nThis cafe is tucked down inside the Place Ville Marie. They have a big seating area available, but some seating areas were not so clean. The menu board is entirely in French, but if you have any grasp of French, the menu is not hard to figure out. The staff here was efficient, but they did not seem too friendly.\n\nBesides their coffee, I've tried their vert frappé  ($4) and blackberry Italian soda ($3). The vert frappé is a ice blended cream green-tea drink that came only in one size- around 16oz. The drink was really good, it tasted like green-tea ice-cream, but for the amount you got, I think it was a little pricey. Also, the blackberry Italian soda was also small for its price, the flavour was true to what it was, but the drink was so sweet I felt nauseated.\n\nOverall, this Van Houtte cafe is good for coffee. The other drinks seem to be a hit or miss and are somewhat pricey for what you get.
