Can I give minus stars?\n\nGES is an extortion racket, period.\n\nWe did a trade show recently in San Diego. They met us at the door as we tried to roll in our own 25 lbs roller bags with our booth in it. Their \"muscle\" told us we had to use them for safety purposes. They gave us a pallet. We piled our few items on the pallet. They moved it 100 feet from the curb to our booth. 1 minute of actual work. We did all the lifting ourselves.\n\nSame thing on departure. For 2 minutes of work, the bill was $1600 or $48,000 an hour. This was in addition to the $250 they charged us for 2 days of 250 amp single electric outlet...about 3000% markup.\n\nThis is what you get when unions run amok.
