Ugh..   I really, really wanted this place to work out.\n\nThey just opened up a few weeks ago and are literally around the corner from my house.  I kept driving by eagerly awaiting opening day as Pho joints on the SW side have really dropped the ball.   I finally got to try their Veggie Pho today, and, let's just say, I've experienced better at some of the chains that are considered really bad.\n\nThe food in itself has a lot of promise.  The broth wasn't as greasy or salty as most.  There weren't many veggies provided in my VEGGIE pho and the ones that were provided weren't very clean.  All in all, the flavor was decent..  There was just one problem.  One rather BIG problem.  I found three hairs in my Pho.  I'm a blonde and the hairs were black.  Clearly, not mine.  It sucks.  Hair is an instant meal ruiner.  Once discovered, the meal is over.   O-V-E-R.  OVERRR!  Sucks.\n\nI also ordered their iced Thai Tea, which was delicious and the fried banana ice cream, which is pretty much impossible to mess up. The Panang Curry was delicious as well.  Great flavor.  It's just those damn hairs.  I get the shakes just thinking about them.\n\nWhat do we need to do to get a great Pho joint?  I've tried places all over the valley and there's always something that ends up going horribly wrong.  I was really excited for this new place to open up as I figured they would have a new fresh product and would probably cook with some excitement.  At least for the first six months.\n\nWTPho, may I please suggest hair nets or at least pulling hair back as a requirement?  All would have been wonderful if those three hairs didn't show up.  Now I sit, hungry and grossed out.   Also, when a customer orders the meatless Pho option, can I suggest providing more veggies?\n\nI'm hoping these kinks will be worked out.  Keeping hair out of the food is like cooking 101.  Once I can get over the hairs, I might give WTPho one more try and an updated review..
