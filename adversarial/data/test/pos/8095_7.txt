Not sure why this has good reviews. We stayed here with our then one year old last year visiting family for Easter and our usual Westin was already booked up. Yikes. \nWas close to my parents, near where I used to live in Kierland, and it seemed okay booking online because we were only staying two nights. This year, no way would I go back there. \n\nThe desk staff was fine and did bring items we requested right away (a zillion pillows so my LO would not roll out of bed). but we had to change rooms TWICE because the first one had no bathtub (special access) when I specifically had called days before and requested a bathtub. The second one, the showerhead was literally ripped off the wall and hanging there. They said gee, you should have never been rented this room, but did NOTHING else.\n\nThe third one, we accepted but had I not been exhausted from flying across the country and carrying my sleeping kiddo from room to room, I would have rejected. I found out about fifteen minutes later when I REALLY looked, that it was filthy with scratched black stains on the tub floor and mold around the trim. \n\nSO there I am at midnight the night before we have an early am brunch, running to a grocery store to clean the bathtub myself! Not cool. The sheets and bedding also stank. And yes, I have a sensitive nose to smell, but even my husband (lol) said they smelled like his grandfather or an old man. So ewwww. Yeah. Luckily my Mom met us at the lobby when we checked in with our sleeping kiddo (long delayed flight) and had brought some extra bedding (and a rail for the bed I had shipped to Mom's house). We used her bedding exclusively because.... ewwww!\n\nOur carpet was also FILTHY! Kiddo's feet were black from walking around the room and she found a bunch of a previous occupant's cereal, a shoe under the couch, a crayon, and a diamond. Literally. Just sitting on the floor. We called the front desk to turn these items in (they did not want the old cereal! Can you believe it???). \n\nThe breakfast was just your standard hotel lobby breakfast btw. There really are way better places nearby for the money!
