I was going to give this place three stars because the sushi is ok, but not great. However, I'm just a sucker for the conveyor belt. They do a really good job of keeping it stocked with all of the favorites.  The only thing I don't like is all the dessert options that come by. Nothing against dessert but jello?  \nOK sushi, fun atmosphere, terrific place to bring your kids and the service is excellent.
