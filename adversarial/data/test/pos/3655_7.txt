Megan is absolutely phenomenal!!! She knows what she's doing with hair -- color, cut, style -- whatever you need done. She will make sure you're not only happy with the \"finished product\", but you'll be ecstatic, looking in the mirror wondering who the sexy beast is staring back at you. Seriously book your appointment ASAP as Megan is such an amazing hair guru that you may have to wait to have her work on your mane. \n\nThe salon is super cute and intimate -- it's a private little suite that is very classy and elegant. I must say it's also extremely convenient that everything needed to get you looking fabulous is in your immediate vicinity. No more sitting next to strangers while processing or walking through half the salon to get your hair washed from your hairdresser's station. \n\nAbsolutely love having Megan do my hair; she is fabulous and I never have to wonder if my hair will look flawless at the end of our appointment. Book your appointment NOW! You're welcome! :)
