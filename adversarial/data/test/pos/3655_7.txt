I've pretty much already reviewed the Venezia's in Tempe, but uhh, this place is just too good. The fact that they have multiple locations is even better. This one is right next to my significant other's house so I can pretty much hit his place up at any time. Essentially it is a staple to our diet. Imagine what would happen if the slaves didn't have cornmeal, or asians didn't have rice, or the Irish didn't have potatoes. Ok?
