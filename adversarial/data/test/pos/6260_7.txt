Great spot for a meat eater and a vegan alike. This steak house has plenty options for those who are vegetarian and gluten free. \n\nAs the meat eaters at the table indulged in every single appetizer, I ordered the creamed corn with truffle and made with cashew cream which tasted like its dairy filled counterpart.  It's def a very decadent side and made for a great start. For my meal, most vegetarian options on the menu were made with gardein meat which contains gluten So my options were limited. I ordered the celery root soup which was not a pleasant texture and reminded me of grits or oatmeal. I would stay away from this soup. \n\nThe rest of the table enjoyed the well executed steaks and the best was the chateau briand which was cooked to a tender perfection. \n\nWe enjoyed the outdoor patio seating with the view of the water and a show that plays every 45 mins with interesting music and art.
