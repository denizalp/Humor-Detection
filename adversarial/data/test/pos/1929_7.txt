Finally, Papa Shunde is open.  It took over the spot where Pavilion was, adjacent to the Husky Gas Station.  The restaurant was recently renovated.  Some parts of the old restaurant remains. The floor has changed to slate flooring and the chairs have been reupholstered.  The dinnerware is of a newer style of Chinese  and I prefer the old fashioned Chinese dinnerware.  I find it really difficult to eat out of my rice bowl.  Just a little too wide and too low.  \n\nPapa Shunde is a mish-mash of different types of Chinese cuisine like Chiew Chau, Singaporean\/Malaysian, Cantonese, Taiwanese.  We ordered the following: \n\n- Fish Fillet Soup with Cilantro and Century Egg - clear broth and quite good\n- Tong Choy with Belachan Sauce - this reminds me of the Singapore dish -has less belachan and missing the chili heat and ground-up dried baby shrimp - Belachan is a shrimp paste made in the form of a block - truly fragrant\n- Fish Fillet in Mini Wok - expected to see fish fillet but turns out to be preserved dried fish cut up in chunks in an interesting broth with Chinese mushrooms and winter melon - the fish was rather tough\n- Beef Brisket in Hot Pot - tender chunks of beef - pot was rather small in my opinion\n- Chef's Messy Chicken - cold poached chicken in a soya based sauce with peanuts, cilantro and ginger all over the chicken - not too bad - expected chicken to be hot.\n\nThe clientele was more Chinese.  I have a feeling that this new eclectic menu needs time to take off.  I think they need to tweak their menu a little bit more.
