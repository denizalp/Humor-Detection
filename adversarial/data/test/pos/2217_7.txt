We were here most recently for the Yelp party, so keep in mind that a place that is giving you free food and beer almost always wins.  It's an excellent business model to get good reviews, but quite awful if you have any interest in making money.\n\nHowever, I have been here before, and it's really cool in just about every way.  The coolest being was that it was an actual Civil War era brewery apparently, and has a bunch of secret catacombs that they used to store ingredients, and quite possibly, dead bodies.\n\nYou can schedule a little mini-tour of the brewery, which is pretty cool as well.  The food is good to very good, and the beer is really awesome.  \n\nThe only bad thing is parking.  There is an attached garage, so if you make it in there, you're safe.  If you don't there's a terrible unpaved, unmarked lot that takes you across a street that has a blind curve and cars driving a million miles an hour.  I lost many frogs trying to get across that road, and my heart aches for each of my dead friends.  But we did make it across eventually and had a wonderful time.
