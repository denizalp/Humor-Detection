I am disappointed to see the quality of this place.\nIt used to be one of my favourite hangouts before they had closed a few years ago.\nI went back for the first time since they reopened, and I was so sad.\nThe interior decor and the food quality deteriorated to standard cafeteria level.\n\nI remember before when I used to love trying their new menu items because they offered a good combination of food quality and market experience.  Sadly not anymore.  Let me explain:\n- fruit flies and insects in the food.  At the pastry corner, while trying to choose which pastry to have, there were insects nesting and flying around the food.  I told the counter lady and she did not even seem surprised, as if this was normal.... so we went to the waffle counter\n- waffle counter was not any better:\n1) no whipped cream even though it is part of the deluxe waffle\n2) came undercooked so it was very soggy\n\n- poor customer service\n1) told the customer service about this experience and was pretty much stared at as if I was overly picky\n2) in spite of all these shortcomings they went ahead and charged for the gratuities (not sure why if we serve ourselves and the part that they are supposed to be in charge of such as cooking and cleaning up were not properly done)\n\nI am also disappointed to see that they automatically include gratuities in the bill.  NOt sure why since:\n- customers have to line up, pick up and carry our own food and utensils (the only part they are responsible for is cooking and cleaning up)\n- they don't cook properly (components of the dish are missing and the food is undercooked)\n- they don't clean up (some tables not cleaned up yet even though the restaurant was not so busy and lots of insects on the food)\n\nSo needless to say I strongly discourage people from trying what used to be a good spot.\n\nFor alternatives try other locations (Eaton, Sherway Garden, York Mills)  I will try as soon as I can and post reviews later
