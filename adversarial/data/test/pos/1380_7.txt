I came here for an early dinner with a friend and it was a night and day difference from my earlier lunch dining experience at OC. We got there before the dinner rush and got a great booth. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. Our meal was good, a hamburger with great flavor and the house salad was good. For dessert we got the Molten Chocolate Cake...Oh my goodness!! It was so GOOD! If you go to Chili's make sure to leave room for this dessert!! The chocolate cake was sweet, moist and warm, the ice cream had a soft chocolate shell and complimented the warmth of the cake with a cool creamy ending. \n\nI might just come back for the dessert. Enjoy!
