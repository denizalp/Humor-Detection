This is a follow up review:\nAfter the owner reached out to me via Yelp message, I proceeded to their website and sent them a message thru their website.  No response.  I then messaged them via Yelp . No response.  It comes back to the same problem as before with lack of communicating with customers. I can upload screenshots of the email thread that they say they can't find.  I can also include a screen shot of my reply via Yelp.
