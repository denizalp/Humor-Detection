Okay, yes - I get waxed. That's all I'll say about that.\n\nBut, wait... It really matters where you get it done. The better the equipment, the more experienced the person who does the waxing, the less pain and discomfort.\n\nReally - now I'm done.\n\nFrilly Lilly is a great place. While I'm waiting, I like to browse their jewellery - it's right up my alley. I never have trouble getting an appointment. For the most part, their employees are very friendly and help keep the conversation going to take your mind off the task at hand. And if I ask them last minute to throw in an eyebrow wax, they're always accommodating. Rea's my favourite but I've liked all of the girls (except one).\n\nThey also do manicures & pedicures and all that fun stuff, if the above paragraphs have made you cringe. So, there's that.\n\nReview #9 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
