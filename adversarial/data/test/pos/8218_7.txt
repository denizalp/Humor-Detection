I went to this bakery over and over when I was in Vegas. Thier baked goods are SO good. I've never had a croissant so crunchy on the outside and so fluffy in the inside. Thier chocolate croissant has just enough chocolate inside (2 little sticks) - not drenched in chocolate like the ones from starbucks. I also got thier raison croissant. It looks like a figure 8, like 2 cinnamon rolls stuck together. Not too sweet, and again, crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. Its one of thier more popular pastries, and I had to get it since it was the last one left. Macarons were to DIE for. They are bigger and thinner than your average size. I didn't think they looked very special but after I got one taste. I literally said \"wow\". The girl behind the registered laughed at me. All thier baked goods are around $4 dollars. More than your average price, but definately worth it!\n\nThier baguette sandwiches are also really good. They are a bit pricey.. but whats new in Vegas? :) ~$11 for a sandwich. 3 different kinds: the roast beef, ham\/cheese, and turkey. I got the turkey. The bread have these huge walnuts. The spread has a garlic kick to it. And the cheese was very flavorful. The bread was very dense and crunchy. You can get a toasted, and the sandwich turns kind of into a panini. Ive had it both ways, and loved it :)\n\nI would go back to vegas, just to get bouchons :)
