freddie's gets five on the strength of one thing - the polish boy.\n\nwe came for the polish boy (after reading about it in esquire's best sandwiches 2008 piece) and we will come back for the polish boy.  did we enjoy other items on the menu?  sure.  but the polish boy is truly special.\n\nwant me to tell you what it is?  okay, fine.\n\nthe polish boy is a thick, juicy kielbasa grilled on the flat, tossed in a big,  soft bun and then topped with crisp french fries, creamy cole slaw and sweet barbeque sauce.  i'm about to snap my laptop in half just thinking about the fact that no one has bound my wrists and ankles and shoved one of these down my neck today.\n\nlook, i know you wanna cock an eyebrow at that description.  i know i did while reading it after the beachland ballroom ripped our souls out when we went there and they told us that the accalimed trailer park monte cristo was no longer on the menu (not to mention looking at us like we were insane for asking).  \n\nbut listen, this thing is just a spectacular blend of top notch individual elements brought together to create a super sandwich.  it's strange, because you might find most of these elements at a potluck, maybe even on the same plate, but never together in the same sandwich - that is until freddie's decided to create 'potluck voltron'.\n\nin fact, i've decided that's what it should be called instead.  potluck voltron.  problem is if you go to freddie's and ask for a potluck voltron they will not give you what you're looking for.  and you NEED to have one of these.  so, i guess we'll just keep calling it the polish boy.\n\none more thing - if you're big on ambiance, not the place.  don't expect it to be.  however, if you're looking for a truly delicious experience in a dirty closet, this is the place.
