Looking for something different to eat we wandered into Binion's Gambling Hall and found this quaint little cafe. When we stepped into the cafe from the casino the wood floors just transport you to simpler times. The server informed us to just seat ourselves and we did just that. The waiter took our order and was very friendly. It is not technically friendly or high tech here so they still hand write the order and manually put them in. At least the order will get relayed properly the first time and the waiter made eye contact with me the whole time I was speaking. \n\nWanting to have breakfast for dinner especially after drinking at Envy and the Pony Con breakfast seemed best. Eggs are the best thing when one comes down from their alcohol. I ordered the Gamblers Special with scrambled eggs. The hash browns were so good. The hash browns really take me back to those cafes that my parents used to take me too. Love the small town feel of the cafe. The prices were really good too. Also, the prices do not reflect in the quality of their food it was so delicious. \n\nBeing wined out I ordered Coors Light with my eggs. See beer pairs well with everything. And I have such a sweet tooth today so I had to have carrot cake too. Their carrot cake is not too bad. The frosting is sweet and has no after taste. Love the feel of stepping out of the fast pace of life and into a calm if just for a bit.
