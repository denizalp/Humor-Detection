I can't believe all the different types of items that are stuffed into this store. They have soda and mondos for the kiddies. All kinds of candy (I've been known to grab an Almond Joy every once in awhile), cookies, fiddle faddle, popcorn and assorted salsas, pastas etc. \n\nIf you need  mardi gras masks and beads, they have that too. All kinds of seasonal stuff, gift bags, paper plates, serving spoons. It goes on and on. There was even a kit that increases your pants size by an inch; no sewing was required. They have tools, flashlights, detergent, shampoo, toothpaste, drinking glasses, school supplies, and toys. I bet a lot of last minute Santas would love this place for gifts and stocking stuffers. It was a madhouse during the weekend before Christmas. You name it, they probably have it. It's amazing all the Sku's that they carry at a Dollar Tree Store.\n\nAnd the most amazing thing is everything is a dollar. My wife bought 12 items here last week and the total was $12 dollars plus tax.
