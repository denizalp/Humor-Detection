Not that impressed with this place, and won't bother returning. I wanted to take an out of town guest somewhere fun for breakfast and had this place bookmarked for a while. \n\nWhat we didn't like was the slow, unfriendly service: We came about 10 am on a Sunday morning and were quoted 25 minutes for a table of 3. We waited 45 mins later after questioning why groups were being sat before us the hostess said \"oh I didn't know you were willing to sit at the high top table.\" Well, you didn't ask and I'm starving now! \nWhen sat...we waited for someone to greet us...5 minutes beverage busser got our drinks...10 mins after our server Robert shows up asking if we were ready to order and realized we still didn't have a menu. Didn't feel welcomed. Bummer wanted to love this place \n\nThe good: the food was very delicious and we all got the same 2 eggs any style, chive potatoes, bacon ($11) they use high quality no hormones\/organic etc food and the taste is great. \n\nMaybe consider takeout? Never tried it for breakfast but the service is so bad and the food is so good it may be worth it.
