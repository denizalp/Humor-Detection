Garage door spring broke.  Called Jeff at 4 p.m.  Gave me a quote - scheduled for same day appointment later that evening.  Calls me later to let me know he is on his way.  Gets in the garage - replaces the spring in 15 minutes!  Done! \n\nI didn't even have time to offer the guy a glass of water!  \n\nThis guy is professional.  No BS, no chit chatting about this and that.  You have a garage door problem - he will fix it for a reasonable price.  Simple. \n\nThanks Jeff!
