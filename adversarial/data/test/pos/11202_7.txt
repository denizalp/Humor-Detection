do NOT use this water delivery service!\ni made the mistake of getting sucked in to signing up for this water service at costco.\ni used to have my own water dispenser and i'd go to the water store to have my 5 gallon bottles filled.\nthat became a little tedious so we decided to pay someone to do it for us instead.\nthat's where ds waters comes in.\n\ni absolutely hated the dispenser they gave us.\nthe water itself was fine but the cost was outrageous at $18.99\/month for 3 bottles.\nyou can fill up your own 5 gallon bottle for $1.25 at any water outlet.\nmost supermarkets even have one inside the store for your convenience.\n\ni recently had a whole home water filtration system installed in my home so i finally called ds waters to cancel my account.\nthe woman i spoke with named VERONICA confirmed that she would cancel my account but that i had already paid for my final delivery and asked if i still wanted to have it since i had already paid for it.\ni told her no since i just wanted to cancel and get this stuff out of my house!\nshe pressed the issue so i asked her if i would be charged again and she assured me that i would not, that my upcoming deliveries were part of the bill that i had just paid.\nso, i agreed to accept a final delivery since i had already paid for it.\n\nlow and behold, i get charged again this month!\nwhy am i not surprised?\noh, and the driver, according to veronica, was supposed to pick up all of my empty bottles and the dispenser today.\ni saw the sparkletts truck drive by my house this morning but didn't stop.\n\ni called ds waters again today to find out what happened.\nall i received was excuse after excuse and that i misunderstood what veronica told me.\ncompletely irate, i insisted on speaking with a supervisor - ALEX.\nhe actually tried to convince me that i misunderstood what veronica explained to me and that she hadn't made any notes in the system about our conversation but that she would not have misinformed me because she has 10 years on the job.\nhonestly, to be working as a customer service rep for a water delivery company for 10 years and not have moved on to, at the very least, a supervisory role does not give me any confidence that she knows what she's doing.\na lot of very loud talking on my part took place and the conversation ended with me still having to pay for the final invoice AND the stuff is still sitting in my house with no date set for pick up.
