Firstly, go here when you have 2000 calories to spare. \n\nSecondly, keep in mind that this is a microbrewery and sometimes they're just not brewing what you might feel like having. The time I went, they only had 4 beers on the menu. 1 stout, 1 london porter, a wheat and the last I cant remember. Luckily I like dark beer otherwise I would be shit out of luck.\n\nGet.the.curry.poutine. No, get the duck confit poutine. Actually wait, get the curry poutine. Or..no, get the duck confit poutine. bahh, JUST GET THEM BOTH! They're surprisingly good. (I told you to spare 2000 calories!)\n\nOther than the poutine and the beer and the pretty awesome 12,000 sq. ft space, there is something for everyone else on the menu, there are salads, beef ribs, corned beef, tuna steaks and even fresh oysters. \n\nI'm going to go back soon and if they give me a beer sampler (not on the menu), this will easily change into a 5 star review.
