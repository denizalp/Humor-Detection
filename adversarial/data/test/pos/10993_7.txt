First off from coming to a major city to a little city.. This has the be the best next thing clt has to offer. Uhm.. Okay? Awkward environment I would have to say. The place is well lit up like we are sitting in class at Sunday school, no music. There are however? Huge TV's that isn't turned on. The Decor is decent. Okay okay okay. Let's Get to the topic! The crawfish on grand opening weekend was whack!! Little bitty ity insects. I was ashamed and embarrassed being the fact I was born in Baton Rouge. They served the fetus of crawfish. Sad sad sad... To add insult to being a foodie diner on the grand opening weekend they advertised Beer on the website menu.. Did not happen.. I had to drink water eating little fetus crawfish. Who drinks water when eating crawfish let alone baby crawfish!? Wow.. So I attempted to come back a second time.. (The GF) made me.. Same thing no beer due no no license at the time. And baby crawfish was still being served. Will I come back?! Yes if Walmart runs out of frozen crawfish in the aisle n it was the last resort..  It is the last resort it's charlotte FML..
