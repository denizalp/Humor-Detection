A night of absolute perfection, with just one minor imperfection. Let me explain why!\n\nLe Vin Papillion is owned by David McMillan who is also the same owner as Joe Beef. Which happens to be one of the most known and best rated restaurants both in Montreal, and Canada. Having that in mind, I had full confidence that my stomach I are were mostly likely going to be very pleased. Indeed we were!\n\nUpon walking in at 5:30pm on A Saturday evening, I was thrilled to see that I could sit in a table for two right away. I do strongly advice all of you that you go early, since space is limited and it gets full fast. Real fast!\n\nWhile waiting for a friend of mine to arrive, I had the time to observe and analyze the ambiance and atmosphere. It took me about two minutes to realize that I was falling in love with the place already. I know, dinner was not served, yet!  However the lights were dimmer, the restaurant was cozy, and warm along with a lovely, light smell of a woodsy indoor grill. With a perfect view of the open kitchen. Which gives you a good glimpse of their hard, dedicated, and talented kitchen staff. \n Within a minute a very kind, and polite waiter was kind enough to offer me something to drink while waiting for my friend. Also asking me if I needed anything and if my table was alright for me. Luckily all those questions had a positive answer of mine. Which made me think, Wow! the service here is spectacular within minutes of walking in. Sadly, I can't say the same thing about many other restaurants I've been to. \n\nFive minutes later now that my friend had arrived(We were a table of two) Time to talk and discuss what shall we order? \nWe've decided to order a few difference different dishes, in order to have a taste of many of their dishes.  Now this is the moment where I will mention the one, and only imperfection I did not enjoy about our dinner experience. \nWhen it came time to look at their menu, we were told to go and look at the blackboard, and take a photo of it with our smartphones. Indeed it's a different concept than most restaurants, but a slightly impractical concept as well.  While the menu items were written in a lovely font, it's a clear font. Along with the dimmed lights, it didn't make it any easier to read. The small light that illuminated the blackboard, was bright enough only to illuminate a small section of the blackboard, not the entire thing. The blackboard is situated in a bit of an backward position nearby the tables. So if people are sitting there or standing there, you will need to ask them to move. If you are sitting by the kitchen as we were, you will need to stand up and go read the blackboard in the traffic of the waiters\/waitress.\n\nNow that I'm standing, and looking at their menu, it's a very helpful thing that I have a strong knowledge of foods, and ingredients. As the menu does not have a description of the ingredients or what each item is. They are simply written with a name. That's it. Therefore if you are unfamiliar with the names or what each item is, you will need to be given a verbal explanation and remember them. A true challenge, but worth it. \n\nNow that we are walking back to our table with a photo of the menu in our smartphone, let's investigate the choices and choose. \n\nWe began by ordering four different dishes. Sliced cooked ham from La Petite Bourgogne. Along with shavings of a very delicious, flavorful, and wonderful texture cheese. Oh my.. Oh my! We simply didn't talk for about 10 minutes while we were madly in love with this dish. This is just the beginning!\nWe also decided to try the \"Champignons Champignons\" Yes, that literally translates to mushrooms, mushrooms\" So we asked for a brief explanation. They were delicate, extremely flavorful, and juicy small caps of mushrooms with an outstanding stuffing inside.  Another \"WOW\" of a dish. \nNow to the more original, and unique dishes.  A sturgeon(fish) pâté with a lovely smoked paprika oil, and creamy as can be. Served along side of friend gnocchi. I already said wow to the previous dishes.. But.. WOW again! \nTo add a bit of a different twist, we've decided to order the roasted cauliflower. Hmmmm we were feeling so so about this dish. The combination of pickled raw onions, with the warm but crunchy cauliflower. It was just \"OK\" Not a wow factor but not a complete failure either. \n\nThe dessert... Chocolate perfection in every bite. A tender buttery crust, filled with an outstanding dark chocolate filling flavored with bergamot, which is a citrus fruit quite similar to an orange but with a more floral taste and less sour. An absolute perfect flavour to pair it with chocolate. Finished by fresh whipped cream and a light sprinkle of chocolate. \n\nWe had moments of silence, moments of goosebumps, and perhaps a slight orgasm here and there? Clearly the dinner did it's job beautifully. We can't wait to go back again, and again. \n\nBravo to David McMillan, and his entire Vin Papillion staff for an outstanding dinner!
