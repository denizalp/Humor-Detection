Authentic Indonesian is a bit of a rarity in Montreal but Nonya does just fine. The beef rendang is particularly good. The service was friendly. I came here with a group and everyone left quite satisfied. I do suggest trying out the reijstaffel menu so you get to taste a bit of everything.\nI'll be returning.
