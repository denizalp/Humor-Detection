Been coming here for years and years. I called in a to go order and asked my usual \"do the currys contain any fish sauce or paste?\"\n\nWell this time he replied \"yes, they all have some kind of fish sauce or paste in them.\" Needless to say I'm devasted after years of them saying \"O yes. It's vegetarian. No fish sauce. Don't worry.\"\n\nI've been eating here for over 4 years at both locations. I have been lied too at lots of Thai places and I am sad the one I trusted the most let me down. \n\nIf you're vegetarian or vegan do NOT come here. \n\nAgain, vegan or vegetarians I would not step foot in here. I would also beware if you have ANY kind of allergy. They cannot accommodate it truthfully.
