Terrible customer service. I don't want to fault her too much because I'm sure serving drunk tourists for a living is not fun, but the cashier had a really negative vibe and attitude. Lots of eye rolling, curt and terse dialogue, and she even threw down our order on the counter.\n\nI had the slice of crack pie which I'd say is overrated. It was good but not $7.00 good for an 1\/8 slice of a maybe-6 inch pie. The store itself and the pie had a whimsical presentation. Glad I tried it but it's not something I'd crave.
