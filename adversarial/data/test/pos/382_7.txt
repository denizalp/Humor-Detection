Having never experienced Ethiopian food, I was very enthusiastic to try a new and highly rated cuisine.  I crave spicy food & was hoping this would compliment, in a different manner, my love for Indian food.  I'm always open to different cuisines, hoping to find my new fav.\n\nNeedless to say from my 2 star rating, this won't make my top 5 list.  First I did not care for the sponge bread nor did anyone else in my party.  It was rather tasteless & the consistency made for a better dish rag than food source.  Our party of three ordered the Meskerem combo, the veggie combie, and a chicken dish.  The lentils that came with all three were extremely bland & not even in the ballpark as the lentils I've had in Indian restaurants.  Where's the spice?  The greens that came with my chicken dish were pretty good, but for some unknown reason, the greens that came on my wife's veggie combo were just plain nasty.  Uneatable.  The chickpeas had no flavor at all.  The best items on the menu were the beef and chicken dishes that came in some brown sauce which had an element of heat, perhaps the only redemption to an otherwise forgettable meal.\n\nSo I left with the question \"Is Meskerem just a bad version of Ethiopian cuisine or is all Ethiopian cuisine bad?\"   Is this really the \"perfect opportunity to enjoy the unique spices and culinary mastery of Chef Tigest's skill\" as Meskerem's website states?  How does the spiciness of this cuisine compare with a fine Indian restaurant?  Is the sponge bread as good as naan bread?  No way.  Is any item they served better than most Indian dishes I've tried.  No way.  All three members of my party agreed.\n\nFashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.  Just because a cuisine is unique does not make it good.
