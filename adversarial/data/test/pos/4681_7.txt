Cool place, first time in was last night.\nDelightful ambience and elegant lighting.\nBartenders were pleasant & knowledgeable.\nThe bar offers nearly three dozen taps, well over 100 beers by the bottle and can, and about 50 wine selections. The Whining Pig bar has an ever-changing selection of beer and wine.\nAsk for a brown bag beer! It's a \"surprise\" cold canned beer selected by your server, nestle in a brown bag & served to you! Fun concept! \nDidn't try their food menu. While The Whining Pig's drink selection may be extensive, the food options are pretty limited. For the wine menu they pair a meat and cheese plate and suggest a sweet peanut butter brownie for dessert.\nWe didn't see this, but supposedly they provide plenty of board games to keep you entertained while you drink! We had great conversation & tried some great new drafts! We will be back..
