We showed up to a friends baby shower to find out that the time our invitation was wrong and we were early. 2 and a half hours early! Our friend suggested we roll with him to pick up a few last minute things for the shower while his wife finished getting ready. One of the stops was for some fruit trays at Mariana's and I'm so glad!\n\nWhen entering the store it felt a bit chaotic. We headed right over where the fresh fruit trays are made and ordered one. The fruit trays can be ordered where they make the fresh fruit drinks and smoothies in the eating area. The fruit trays were $19.99 each and they cut it up fresh right in front of you. \n\nAfter getting back to the house with the fruit trays and other supplies we were told that we didn't get enough and to go back and get 3 more fruit trays! So after going back to Mariana's and ordering 3 more fruit trays the worker informed us that they usually require at least 1 day in advance for any fruit tray to be made. She as well as another kind lady hustled to get all the fruit cut up and meet our needs. I thought that was so cool I mean she could have easily turned us away as they did have a long line for the fruit drinks. \n\nSince it was going to be up to an hour for the fruit trays to be finished, I wanted to walk around and see what else this store had to offer. The butcher department was flooded with people and they had such a nice variety of meats you can't find at Von's or Smith's etc. The produce department didn't leave much of a good impression to me. The fruits and veggies were small and nothing spectacular. Maybe it was the day and maybe it was the time of season who knows. The bakery department was for sure my favorite! They had such an assortment of breads and pastries I never even knew existed. Their \"Tres Leches Cake\" looked so yummy. They had a smaller version for only $4.99! The donuts and GIANT cookies were also $4.99 a doz. \n\nI was now back to the fruit drinks and spotted a tasty looking ham sandwich in the case. My friend insisted I try it and bought it for me. I sat at a table in the eating area and had my way with this delicious jamon sammie! The cheese that was on the sandwich was a nice and different and hit the spot. They have plenty of options for food such as tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and much more made fresh to order in the eating area. I want to go back and try the tacos.\n\nI am so glad that we came to this store! I will for sure be back for cakes, pastries, breads and to eat lunch as it is all conveniently in the same corner in the store. I can't see myself really going out of that *corner* though since the produce didn't appeal to me.\n\nPlease remember to call ahead if you need anything made on a certain day so that you can make sure to have it when you need it.
