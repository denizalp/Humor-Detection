MTO is hyped up Kimbo Slice style and lucky enough, it will have way more staying power than the former street fighting champ's run in the UFC (sorry, Kimbo!). \n\nOrdered the 'Broccoli' (broc, egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalape√±o, mushrooms) in a whole wheat wrap ($12). Added a side of hash browns ($2) bc the accompanying side was two slices of tomato and a few pieces of lettuce. I always enjoy a salty break from an egg sammie (doesn't everyone?), but was turned off by the additional charge. Even more perplexing is that you can order it as a skillet (with potatoes) for the same price. Either way, that side of browns was phenomenal and almost got a second order sent my way. A crunchy outside, an almost creamy inside... oof. So good. Maybe I'll order 6 of those next time. The wrap itself was also very good. A great combo of veggies and cheese made each bite delish. The 'Chicken' (chicken sausage, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, arugula) was also good, but a bit heavy for my taste. If you're a sausage and onions kinda guy, look no further (OK, maybe look down further to the MTO Breakfast). Service? Ours was excellent.\n\nIs the vibe cool? Yes! Do I want to come back here for lunch? Sure! Does paying $28 for 2 egg 'wiches and an iced tea (w\/o potatoes) stink? Why yes, it does. Unfortunately, since it's not really located by anything else I frequent, I can't see myself being a regular here. However, a few times a month I'll def be hangin out. A large 2-steps up from a greasy spoon. 4-stars for now and I'll be back for more!\n\nProtip: Check out their fb page for special Sunday night dinners with local chefs.\nBro-tip:  $15 AYCD mimosa or bloody mary's
