This is our favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas, PERIOD! Every single thing we have ever tried here has been delicious (especially the pop rockin' roll - yes it has actual pop rocks in it), and the service is amazing. Don't expect to see a bill under $150, but if you like upscale dining, amazing and fresh sushi, and great customer service, this is the place to go!
