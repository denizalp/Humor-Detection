I usually wander around aimlessly whenever I'm here shopping with Mr. B., so I really don't know if they carry the best selection of tools and that sort of things. I do know their customer service is great and whenever we do come here to get a part for some fix-it or honey-do project,  the staff here is pretty knowledgeable when we have questions on plumbing stuff or electrical wiring. \n\n1pm SATURDAY .... Not only did we have exceptional customer service at this Lowes location, they had the best all around selection and inventory of major appliances to choose from. In particular, washing machines.  \n\nGina? in Appliance department did the sales transaction and made my day when I was told my washer was in stock and could be delivered the next day! Awesome!\n\nThe Orange and the Blue Yellow stores had the same washer, same price, offered free delivery, installation, but didn't have that edge when it came to inventory and delivery (3 days out at earliest) so that was their loss.\n\n1PM SUNDAY ... Delivery guys (3rd party. XPO company used see my review) called when they were on the way.  My washer arrived within the time frame. Yes! \n\n6AM MONDAY ... Im back at the store! After the second load I did last evening, the brand new washer I got quit on me.! Error code said clutch problem, which meant it was pretty much FUBAR.\n\nSo here I am back at Lowe's.  6AM..no sleep and close to having a melt down.  This time there was no one working on the floor that early in appliances. I got 3 sales people that came up to help when I pushed that button to ask for assistance.  Told them what happened and they (Charlotte?) called her assistant manager to see what they could do.\n\nInitially they were going to send out service tech first thing that morning to verify it was broken.  Luckily I took video and pix of it when it worked and the error code it displayed.  So thank you assistant manager for making the final decision to exchange me out for a new washer! \n\n1PM.. later that day..got my washer, and all is clean again in my little home.\n\nSo nothing but praise for Lowe's staff here. Plus cool points for being open real early, and for having what we need or want in stock here.
