My first and last visit to Attic Salt was this past Saturday. My friend and I weren't quite certain what type of store it was, but something about the colors and the layout drew us in.\n\nOnce inside we took an immediate left, and noticed a display of colorful socks. \n\nOn closer inspection it appeared that these socks had affirmations written on them.\n\nOn even closer inspection it was apparent that several of these affirmations contained profanities, like the S-word and the F-bomb.\n\nThese socks were openly displayed just inside the door, at a height where any child could wander in and see them very clearly.\n\nI found this to be quite disturbing. \n\nI cannot for the life of me tell you about any other products in the store, because I left immediately.\n\nI am shocked at the utter lack of discretion and professionalism on the part of the store's owner, manager, and anyone who stocks their shelves. \n\nIf this is the new norm, I don't want any part of it. And neither will my wallet.
