Based on my time here today I can say that the staff and doctor I saw were friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable but man.... Why did I have to wait to long!  I got there around 7:50 am for a 8:00am appointment.  Filled out some paperwork then 8:23am rolls around still nothing..... I go in the back around 8:26 then answer some questions then wait some more until about 9:02.\n\nThats when another tech walked in and I answered a few more questions.  Then 7-10 minutes later the doctor came in and asked a few more questions.  Let me know what was going to happen and thats it.  \n\nLike I said ..... everything went so great except for the long waits.  \n\nThe location is behind UMC hospital and its on the third floor
