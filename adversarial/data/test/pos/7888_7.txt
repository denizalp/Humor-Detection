3.5 stars.\n\nI've been going to Weiss, since before it was called Weiss. It used to be called Samuels, or something to that effect.\n\nToday, I went in with my daughter, my mom and my brother. It was an afternoon weekday, so we had no problem getting a table. \n\nMy menu was dirty.\n\nI ordered the soup (with ball) and a 1\/2 of a corned beef. My brother got the rueben open faced, and my mom got the corned beef with coleslaw.\n\nMy soup came out first, and it was as delicious as ever. My sandwhich came out with ever one else's meal. \n\nLooking around, the wall that separates the tables from the servers station is FILTHY. I mean, dust bunnies ! Coffee grounds... A quarter. I mean, yowza would it kill someone to wipe that down ?
