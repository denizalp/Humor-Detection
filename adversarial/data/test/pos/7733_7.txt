What a gem! This place is definitely worth a try! The food was delicious and affordable! ($11.99 weekdays and $12.99 weekends)\n\nI came for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed at all. They recently changed to a buffet line where you can take your own food. The selection is smaller than other places, but they make up in flavour and freshness. All the dishes were good, but the curry goat and butter chicken was absolutely divine! Don't forget about the fresh naan either! \n\nDefinitely my lunch go-to place for Indian food.
