This is a partial review due to I did not purchase from them, but I did look at a vehicle and have it inspected by a dealership that resulted in me turning away from this dealer. To start off I showed up about ten minutes after they opened and no one had the keys to the car I wanted to see. So I had to wait another ten minutes for someone to show up. I test drove the 2011 Jetta TDI and noticed a few things wrong off the bat. So I ask for any maintenance records and they had a few. One thing that was another warning sign was they had recharged the a\/c unit recently. So I had the car taken to Camelback VW for a pre-purchase inspection. Two of my suspicions were true the a\/c was shot ($1200 repair cost) and there was oil in the coolant which is a tell-tell sign the head gasket is leaking\/blown. So I passed on the car, the funny part is they originally had it listed at $11,500 and they have dropped it several times up til this posting its at $9,900. Buyers beware make sure you do a pre-purchase inspection.
