Do not succumb to the chocolate brownie.  At around $5, I expect a lot more.  This was better than your average, but it was just there.  Maybe we should have popped it in a micro and had it with a side of vanilla ice cream, but we picked at it right out of the bag, in our micro-less hotel suite.  Sad.\n\nDo try the litchi ginger chocolate.  As a rule, I do not like white chocolate.  This one, though, made me smile.  \n\nOur little bug enjoyed a gelato- lemon and the choco orange.  The choco orange has little hunks of orange rind.  To die for.  Loved, loved, loved the choco orange.   They also serve a little chocolate bar (milk or dark, you choose) on top of your gelato.  Hence the 3 stars.\n\nPricey- we must have blown at least $30 for chocolates, gelato, the aforementioned boring brownie, and such.  I rather spend that at Chocolats Privilege but that is just me.  I just wasn't in the mood for pricey, single origin chocolates I guess.\n\nThe bathroom was super clean.  That was the only bathroom that I could get the bug to use that day, which is a major thing when you are potty training on the road.  It earned her mark of approval as she said \"This is a good bathroom!\"- ha.  Sparkling white, nicely scented.  Much appreciated.
