I am such a fan of the Phoenix location and St. Francis that I was pretty stoked to hear that chef Aaron Chamberlin was putting a location in the East Valley (closer to home for me). I thought the decision to put a location in a quiet residential part of southern Tempe with no restaurants within a mile was pretty bold for them. They are essentially sending a message that they are going to own this area and be a cafe for the surrounding neighborhoods. I'll be honest that my first couple of visits during opening month had its issues. The lines were super long and the customer service was working through many kinks. But after a few months, Tempe Public Market is quietly settling in and becoming a staple in this area. The patio area is dog friendly and very spacious. They have plenty of misters for the hot summers and a killer fireplace for the colder winter evenings. I like that beverages (non-alcoholic) are self-serve. They have counter service for ordering your food and seating is open. These are some of those things that makes this place feel like home. So far I've had breakfast and dinner here now. The Blue Corn Pancake is fantastic. It's pretty large but not too filling for a pancake. The Steel Cut Oats are good but a little on the pricey side for me for oatmeal. I did enjoy coming here for community night for dinner. They do a 3 course dinner for around $13 that includes salad, entree and dessert. The fried chicken was nice and tender and really flavorful. Overall I can see this as a regular stop for me (especially in the mornings on that patio). I love the Farmer's Market at the Phoenix location and hope that is something that gets incorporated here someday.
