24 hour CVS store located on the strip that always come through for me.  So we were vacationing here and I couldn't really bring my contact solution on board the plane or any water for that matter.  Well, CVS comes through.  I bought all the essentials here from toothbrush, shampoo, deodorant, soap, water you name it.  Yes I had to buy all that because I was staying in Vegas for a week.\n\nThe store is huge and it stays open.  The only downer is walking back with all that stuff.  The store has pretty much everything you can think of.  There are plenty of registers open or they even have a self check out area if you don't prefer to wait.  The customer service is really nice.   Aside from that their liquor options is really nice too.  I'm telling you this store has everything you need should you stay the extra long days like I did.\n\nOverall, this is probably the best spot to take care of all your shopping essential duties.  Nothing beats this shop for sure.  I'm not even that big of a CVS fan and I'm already super impressed with them.  Whenever I come back to Vegas I'll definitely be here again to buy everything.
