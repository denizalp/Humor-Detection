I bought two pints of this from whole foods today and I just read the ingredients list. They use corn syrup in their products!!!! This is a disgrace.  I can't believe Whole Foods sells your products.  I will never buy this again.  Why wouldn't you use cane sugar?  I am throwing this away and telling whole foods to stop selling your product.
