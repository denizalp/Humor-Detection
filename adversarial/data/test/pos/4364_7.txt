The \"& BBQ\" had me a bit curious. I've been to other angry crabs bit this was my first BBQ one. \n\nLove the whole seafood boil idea, eating with your hands and enjoying the flavorful sauce that douses the  seafood of your choice. Add some sausage or corn for some extra fun!\n\nMy family and I enjoyed a night here and it was pretty perfect since my brother isn't a big seafood lover. The cheeseburger on the menu was a shock to me but much appreciated by my brother. \n\nEnjoyed the shrimp with the trifecta sauce, next time I'd like it a little more spicy but overall tasty!\n\nService was pretty good, above par. Hostess wasn't amongst the friendliest but our sever was great!
