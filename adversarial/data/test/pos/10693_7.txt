Since I enjoyed lunch, I took my husband and daughter for the buffet on Sunday. All the staff were very kind to my daughter, and made us feel welcome to bring a 3 year old who does spontaneous song and dance.\nSince it was father's day,  several more young families were enjoying their buffet as well. I'm pretty sure they didn't charge us for a our kid- we had 2 drinks and 2 adult buffet trips for $24. \nShort of having a toy area, this place was very kid friendly. We will be coming again!
