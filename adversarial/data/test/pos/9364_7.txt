I was there when they opened in 1980 and now I spend the last money I will ever spend there. It is bad when you sit at a bar stool at 3pm and then a beer bust gets rolling around you when some east coast attitude comes up and harassed the hell out of you calling you names expletives and the big huge Mexican bartender refuses to handle the situation. So I take it to Ron and still this guy continues to harass us. I told Ron I know why I come once a year now that I know they let customers harass customers. Such a total disappointment that Ron would let what others claimed as a loud mouth obnoxious east coaster to run customers off. Adios and don't waste you money on this dive.
