Question: who the eff asked for more asians in the clubs? \n\nHakkasan was a major fail in my book for many reasons.  I would say skip this place unless your ideal mate is a 5'0\" asian male. \n\nFirst of all, the managers and promoters are incredibly rude and 'require photo submission' to get on guestlist. seriously, WHAAT?! you know those hot girls in 5inch heels and skin-tight dresses? HELL no do they want to walk half a mile, just to go up and down a bajillion stairs. Get it together; your club sucks and Lady LingLing is unsatisfied.\n\nAlso, no outdoor pool\/patio area? how's a girl supposed to hustle some drinks then? Hakksan has the perfect recipe for failure: expensive as hell + thirsty girls + rude management + terrible layout= unhappy vegas-goers. Back to XS, I go.
