I would like to start my review by saying that the coffee is wonderful. I travel out of my way to buy Dutch Brothers Coffee. With that being said I would like to comment on the employees. I don't want to be that grumpy person saying everyone's too friendly, appreciate these employees who stand in the sun to get your order and try to make small talk for a tip I get it. \n\nWhat I find most annoying is being questioned every time I go to Dutch Brothers the following questions: what are your plans for today what do you plan on doing later who is this in the car is this your sister are you guys just hanging out is this coffee for you can I get a fist-bump can I get a high five is that your dog. Not to mention I cannot hear over the music when I'm paying at the window. The music is so loud I rarely know what my total is unless I look at my receipt, if I get one. \n\nAgain I don't want to be the Grinch but I think that the employees need to focus on the coffee and being friendly the old-fashioned way with a hello or good morning and a smile and leave out the constant intrusive and excessive questions and the fist bumping and the high fives I just want coffee in the morning and I want to get on my way.
