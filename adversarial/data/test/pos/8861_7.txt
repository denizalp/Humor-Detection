Discovered Rebecca Yin at Sante Spa. She is one of the best masseuses I've been to. She has great technique, she mixes in some Thai massage techniques to get at those really tense shoulder muscles.  She works at Sante spa mostly on Saturdays and Sundays, so it's convenient to book appointments. Sante Spa has nice facilities, clean and modern. They have showers and a dry sauna. A good tip is to purchase Sante Spa gift certificates at Costco, you can get $100 worth for $75. They also do complimentary valet parking. Just say you're a spa guest.
