Waited one hour for my pizza. The pizza was tasteless and very dry! Horrible experience dining here in terms of food and service! Many customers dining in restaurant was yelling at the cashier about their food! Cashier sold alcohol to people standing in the line without checking ID\/drivers licence.\n\nNumber one issue, there were some minor age people in the line asking to buy beer in the restaurant, the cashier took payment and gave the beer without checking ID. This happened repeatedly when I was waiting one hour for my pizza.\n\nNumber two issue, I kept asking the cashier\/server how long the food will take. She was clearly poorly trained. She got me and the other table confused and mixed up.\n\nI told the cashier\/server I haven't gotten my food yet. Me and my friends have been waiting a long time at the table. The worker said \" oh you didn't get it yet ?\". THE EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THEIR JOB.\n\nI can clearly see the owner and management in this restaurant is poor and weak. When the employee doesn't know how to do her job, they allow her to give horrible service to the dining customers. By making them wait 1 hour for a pizza at their table with the waiting number in their hand.\n\nWorst service ever. Don't recommend anyone to come here!
