I can't believe I never reviewed Avalon! I'm very glad it's my 500th review though, so let's begin:\n\nI happened upon Avalon during CRAVE Arizona's week of festivities October 21 - 24. My shop was the retail partner for the wine events and I was required to attend one of the luncheons on Friday, Oct 23. What a tough life I lead. Avalon is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but they excel at what they are doing so it's a destination worth finding. \n\nMy lunch was exquisitely paired with two WA wineries, Milbrant and Gordon Brothers. It's actually pretty hard to make a perfect pairing with very specific wines so kudos to Executive Chef Travis Watson for his masterful menu. I'm going to ruin your whole day right now and tell you what I ate:\n\nFirst Course \nSmoked mussel soup with crispy leeks and crusty garlic bread\n - I love mussels but the idea of mussels out of the shell kind of creeps me out. This soup was so smoky and spicy everyone at our luncheon asked for more. It was served in a demitasse which was tragic, but a great way to start an amazing meal.\n\nSecond Course \nOrganic petite green salad with Granny Smith apples and walnut streusel - Chef Travis came out to talk to us about how his goal with Avalon is to source local, biodynamic and organic produce and meats across the board. This salad was fresh with just that hint of sweetness from the streusel. It wasn't overwhelming at all and I thought the Riesling we had with it was an inspired match.\n\nThird Course \nGrilled rib eye steak with black truffle risotto, foie butter and baby heirloom beets - I'm not a vegetarian anymore. I'm not even going to pretend. I chowed on this steak and it was delightful, very pink in the middle and deliciously moist. The risotto was a little dry and not very hot; my only critique of the day. The heirloom beets were orange and tiny and I actually ate them (not a beet fan). \n\nFourth Course \nMilk chocolate and salted caramel torte with espresso essence and tangerine pearls - aaaaaa! This was ridiculously good, and waaaay too big after all we'd eaten. I'm a dark chocolate fan myself, but this worked in every way imaginable. The milk chocolate and the salty caramel? puhleese it was amazing. \n\nI saw three of my clients heading out after their own lunch in another half of the restaurant and they told me this is their go to place for high quality eats. They sang me the praises of the lobster bisque, though they told me the wine selection was seriously lacking. Aww they are so loyal! I met two couples at the lunch who were also voracious fans of Avalon and hysterically shouted across the table that we all need to support this place and tell our friends. \n\nI'm with them; do yourself a favor and dine at Avalon.
