Terrible experience.  The car started dying RIGHT after we drove away.  Engine light came on later that day....it was a mess! They said they'd fix it and they kept it for over 2 months!   It ended up being vandalized at the shop (keyed in terrible and rasict symbols) and was sooooo dusty and dirty it was clear it had just been sitting....even though the office staff seemed cool, I cannot recommend this company
