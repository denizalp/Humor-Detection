Wings were tiny and sub par to other wild wings. Tuesday wings \"deal\" is disappointing. 1,5lb for 10.99 with a 3$ drink purchase. One flavour only. I have had much better experience with St. Louis wings. For the same price, you can get four instead of two flavours , fries and dip included. \n\nI would not recommend this to anyone. Well we were the only people on a Tuesday evening. Go figure.
