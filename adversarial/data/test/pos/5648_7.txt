Any good Chinese restaurant will have 2 menus - the \"americanized\" one and the \"authentic\" one.  The owner of this place will give you the \"American\" one if she doesn't know you.  I can't comment on this menu since I have never ordered anything off of it.  Enter the \"authentic\" menu.  I have no idea what \"Wahsun\" means, but I think it should mean \"the magic wok\".  There is an exceptional smokey flavor to all of the dishes that are stir fried at this place.  I sometimes wonder if there is a  flavoring ingredient called special-smokey-flavored-wok-crack that just keeps me going back for more.  I experienced possibly the best lo mein outside of NYC which is quite phenomenal for this part of Phoenix.  It had a very authentic flavor, all dente, almost crisp egg noodles with the perfect mix of Chinese greens.   The walnut shrimp (w\/mayo) was a dish I haven't seen in a few years and was done very very well.  We also ordered the steamed whole fish flounder which was just ok.  They can also put things together that are not on the menu.  On my first visit, I asked for chicken and chinese broccoli and they hooked it up.  \n\nOf note, this place is cash only.  Don't expect anything more than hole-in-the-wall decor -  fully clad with sticky lazy-susans which just makes me love this place even more!
