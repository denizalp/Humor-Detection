As far as location and overall vibe of Z'Tejas goes- it's a hit. It seems to serve alot of young, attractive people... The outdoor eating and bar is fun- and the big screen TV's are a cool... but the food and service was just a total miss for me. \n\nUnfortunately, the food just didn't have much going on. First, the cornbread is a fun idea and is a nice change to free appetizers- but it was super thick and lacked any real cornbread flavor or consistency. The Catfish Tacos were a whole lot of cabbage and not much else... i literally could not taste the meat flavor hidden under the amount of cabbage stuffed in. And sadly, the Baked Seafood Enchiladas were another miss- it appeared to be two tortillas covered in sauce and rice with two shrimp inside... i couldn't taste much else and felt i could have taken a better stab at making this meal at home myself =\/ (See my pictures to get a better idea)\n\nOn top of this, the service was a bit lackluster. There seemed to be a waiter and waitress simultaneously serving us- one taking the order, one getting our drinks, the other bringing out our food, the other with our check-  As confusing as this was, it was difficult for me to get my water refilled and had to flag down the waiters 2-3 times to get their attention.\n\nI'd like to add that during my stay in Phoenix i saw the hottest girls of my entire vacation at Z'Tejas(which was a plus, lol) But seriously, If you're cruising the mall and looking for a quick bite to eat- it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out Z'Tejas, just don't expect to much... i'm sure this place does it's drinks much better =)
