I consider myself a bit of an expert on Tibetan food, having grown up on it, and in my expert (humble) opinion Tsampa is THE place for Tibetan food in Toronto. Set up more like a fast food joint- no printed menu's (just a white board), you seat yourself, lots of patrons take it to go & cheap prices - the decor is minimal and functional, but once you're eating, it's hard to care. \nTheir menu is not extensive, but genearlly Tibetan food is limited in choices. What they do have though, is a good selection of well prepared Tibetan food. My favorite dishes here have to be their pork chowmein, shabhaley (beef patty), aloo dum (spicy potatoes served with puri), and their momos (dumplings). \nIf I had to mention a con - they have ceiling to floor windows on two sides, and while it's great for people watching, it's not so great for people watching you as they walk by when you're stuffing your face :) so maybe they could put up some sheer curtains??
