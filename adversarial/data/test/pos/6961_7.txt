Flanny's is an unassuming place located in a strip mall. I would never think of coming here unless someone took me. What makes Flanny's are the people, oh, and the craft beer. This place is buzzing at night with beer geeks exchanging ideas and talking about the latest and great in beer. When I was there I actually had a chance to meet the owner of Bells. How cool is that and how often does something like this happen? I was impressed with the beer selection and the clientele. I had something to eat but the entire beer scene has blocked my memory on what exactly I had! ;)
