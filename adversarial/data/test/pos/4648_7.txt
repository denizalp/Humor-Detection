I went to Sura tonight.  I usually come here every other week.  For the record, I am the Duke #1 regular here on Yelp.  I've checked in 23 times throughout 2-3  years.  Unfortunately this will be my last.  I bring a lot of friends and family here and recommend it to everyone.  This will also not happen anymore.  So what happened?  \nI was doing what I do every time I come here which was cooking Kalbi beef on the grill.  There seemed to have been a very irritable waiter who did not like the way I was cookng the meat.  He told me I can't cut the bones out.  I replied with, \"do you want me to eat the bones?\"  He then leaves the table and says it's ok.  I proceed to cut the meat the way I want.  I basically just cut the bones and chunks of fat out and eat the lean meat.  5  minutes go by and this overzealous waiter comes back and says the Owner said I can't cut the meat like that because the price of beef is going up and they will charge me extra..... I personally think this waiter guy instigated the whole thing and don't think the Owner had a problem with anything.   I politely asked him how he would like me to cut the meat and that I have been cutting it this way for years.  He didn't really show me how he would have liked me to cut it.  At this point, my buddy got annoyed and suggested we just leave.  So we did.  Honestly, who wants some punk waiter hovering over you and telling you how to cook your meat?  It's not even his meat ! \nI want to add this is the same clown that I dealt with last week that throws the bill on the table in the middle of the meal and says there is a \"shift change\" and to pay the bill right then and there.  But after further observation, my table was the only one that got hit with this \"shift change\" tactic.  The other tables around me didn't get this premature bill.  Did he think I was going to run out without paying?  Very bizarre individual.  \nI ended up going to Via Brasil in Summerlin where the wait staff was superior to Sura.  It was like night and day difference.  That Sura guy with the purple shirt and the glasses needs to apologize AND offer me a comp for me to come back and lift the boycott.  Otherwise, you will be seeing a new Duke here very shortly.
