Not bad, the decor of the place is great; it looks clean, new and contemporary... I didn't really understand why there's a disco ball in the lobby but what the hell.\n\nIt's one of the best fast food chicken fingers intown, the meat was very tender. Fries are good, sause was great, cole slaw was good; however, it's been 30 minutes since my meal and my body feels like it's overdosing on cholesterol... \n\nI'll be back if I don't suddenly die right now.
