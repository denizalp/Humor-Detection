We have been excited to come here since seeing it listed on Yelp. Brought some out of town friends along with our family looking forward to a fun night.....but after we sat down we discovered half of our large party who don't eat beef or pork had literally zero choices. No chicken, no veggie, nothing!  So we left. shocked they would not have at least one option available!  Very poor decision and bummer for us. Don't come here unless EVERYONE in your party eats beef or pork.
