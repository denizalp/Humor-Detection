We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat and we love Fatburger, so we stopped by the food court in the casino to give it a try.  We ordered:\n\nMedium (1\/3 lb) Fatburger w\/Cheese and Thousand Island, $6.18\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/fatburger-laveen?select=InI0b_GNUW2MgrPyK9NwAw#InI0b_GNUW2MgrPyK9NwAw\n\nLarge (1\/2 lb) Fatburger, $6.49\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/fatburger-laveen?select=Gv9rJX6JmRqk8jnowWs4TA#Gv9rJX6JmRqk8jnowWs4TA\n\nFat Fries & Soda, $2.50\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/fatburger-laveen?select=XJgSgURQ8ivsNyoXZfbgDQ#XJgSgURQ8ivsNyoXZfbgDQ\n\nChili Cheese Fries & Soda, $4.80\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/fatburger-laveen?select=QnyMBdu6pOrlbgvpyBADEA#QnyMBdu6pOrlbgvpyBADEA\n\nDescribing Fatburger as fast food would be incorrect....it's actually pretty slow, because they make each Burger from scratch.  All locations are like that, so it's not a surprise...this one is no different.  \n\nOur food came out and it was not quite what we'd ordered....I asked for Cheese & Thousand Island on my Large Fatburger, but they were missing....when I looked at the receipt, I could see that the cashier forgot to add it on there...my mistake for assuming and not checking it....damn, I hate when I do that.\n\nThe food was very good though...Burgers were fresh and full of flavor.  The Chili Fries were good too....I rarely order them, but was in the mood to have it.\n\nOverall, this place gets 4 Stars for the food and 2.5 on the service...rounded to 3.  \n\nReturn Factor - 50%
