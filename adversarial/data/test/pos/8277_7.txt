I had a taste for some authentic Greek food so my sister recommended Mykonos Grill! \n\nAs soon as I walked through the door the smell from the kitchen delighted my taste buds and confused me, \"confused because I wanted to try everything!\" Lol...\nThe young lady behind the counter (Aliyah) was very helpful and even described how yummy the soup was and offered me a sample (and it was tasty). The food was cooked fresh to order and came out quickly! \n\nI ordered the chicken wrap with a Greek salad and this plate was a beast! It is defiantly a two person or eat some now save for later platter!  \n\nThe only thing they could have done better was wrap the chicken wrap in foil because it was a little soggy by the time I got home! The inside was still very tasty!
