Went to pineapple park for the first time the other day since a friend told me that they had dole whips and dippin' dots there. I was initially very excited since rarely do you see dole whips outside of Disneyland and Disney world, not to mention my son is a big sucker for dippin' dots, so I decided to drive over there after I picked my son up from school as a nice little surprise. The dole whip was good-- good flavor, just like disney's, and the dippin dot's were, well, they were dippin' dots. No complaints in the food aspect! However, I must say the customer service is extremely lacking. We came in and no one else was there, and the girl behind the counter just gave us this cold, icy look, with nary a greeting. I tried to be nice and polite to her, but she was very aloof, and it almost felt like we were inconveniencing her by being there. I said thank you, of course, after she gave me back my change and after we got our ice cream, and not once did I hear a peep from her. It was just so uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, I read some of the reviews on here before actually trying out the place, and the replies the business owner made were very off-putting. It almost feels like she is overly defensive over the littlest critiques of some, if not most, of the reviews. I do wish they'd train their employees more on proper customer service. You don't have to be all peppy and cheery, but a little smile sure goes a long way!
