Trashbags. They lost a great amount of sales tonight from us. Want to be a b on the loud speaker cause we were meeting friends and didn't order drinks fast enough? Well there goes your sale and your tips trashbag bartenders. The place was less than half full on a Saturday night at midnight. Pathetic. Also if someone is a DD don't talk mad sh** when they are trying to save lives by driving the people around that are drinking and providing you with a job of serving and making profit, you servant peasants.
