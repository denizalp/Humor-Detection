Went on a Sunday and was treated to the best buffet in the area. So great to be able to try out different dishes. Tons of main dishes but the chicken tikka and the paneer dael  were outstanding. Under cover seats from the sun,  so we sat at an outside table which gave it a fun holiday atmosphere. The interior is beautiful and would be date worthy! \n\nAverage prices-business casual dress-relaxed on Sunday for buffet-great parking.
