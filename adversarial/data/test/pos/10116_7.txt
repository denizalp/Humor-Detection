This place is like a McDonald's play place on steroids. It's only $10 for the kiddos and adults and children over 11 are free. Bring socks otherwise you have to buy them there. There are lots of things for the kids to do. They can climb through tunnels, jump on trampolines, slide down slides and even dress up as their favorite super hero\/princess. They have a designated toddler area for the smaller kids which is appreciated because some of the other areas were taken over by older kids. My son, who is almost 2, had a blast here. In about 2 hours he burned a ton of energy and took a reallllly long nap afterwards which is a win for mom!\n\nWhat I really liked about this place is the perks they offer parents. Free massage chairs, coffee\/tea\/water, and free wifi. You can relax while your kiddos have fun. There are even tv's so you can see your kiddos playing in the play area. They sell food and snacks, and have tables where you can eat. You can also book parties here. \n\nThe only real gripe I have is security\/number of employees. So when you arrive they stamp your hand and the other people in your party with the same stamp. But when we left no one checked our stamps. The person at the front counter was busy checking people in. So who's to say I didn't take someone else's kid or someone else take my kid? I guess I am not really sure what the point of the stamps is if no one is checking them. The place did get pretty crowded at one point which is when we decided to leave, and it just makes me nervous that there are so many people and seemingly not enough employees. But with all that said I watch my kid like a hawk so there's no way he's getting out of my sight. We will come back.
