I think I get a very basic type of men's haircut: short on the back and the sides, about an inch on the top. Sort of a caesar. I arrived at 9:00 am when they opened and the two staff were friendly and ready to go. When she'd finished cutting my hair she asked if I'd like my eyebrows trimmed, which has never happened before at any salon ever. I sometimes do it myself, with hilarious results. She said she also works in a salon where they do facials and waxing, so she's used to doing more treatments. For that reason alone I'd give her 5 stars, but my haircut is so simple I should curb my enthusiasma little bit.
