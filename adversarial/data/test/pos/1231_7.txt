I came here because I wanted to see if it was going to be as big of a shit storm as it was on tv....\nIt was.\n\nI think the people that gave it 4 or 5 stars expected to eat poop... Yeah the food was 2.5 starts but there is still awful service and the owners are yelling all of the time. And it still took 3 hours to eat crappy pasta and a piece of dry chocolate cake.
