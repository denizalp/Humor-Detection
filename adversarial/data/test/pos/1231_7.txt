The front entrance at Padre's Modern Mexican is really one of the most unique and inviting entrances I've experienced in Phoenix. The use of glass and wood are truly lovely.* \n\nThat said, Padre's appeals to the lowest common denominator of the hip hop crowd that patronize this restaurant on Sunday afternoons. With a $5 cover, one would think there would be more of a draw than good music and a periodically tight crowd. Unfortunately, the music is where it begins and ends with Padre's. \n\nSome years ago we ate at Padre's and found the food to be quite good. I don't know what happened in the interim. For a restaurant that is first and foremost a place to get food, and also serves alcohol, to be serving their foodstuff on paper plates is disastrous. Yeah, I understand that you'll be saving a lot of water not having to wash all those plates, but that's something I expected at a bar that serves food as an afterthought--not the other way around. And if a restaurant has a waitstaff, one can reasonably expect an amicable staff with at least an iota of attentiveness towards their clientele. Nope, not here. I do understand that the younger crowd wasn't raised to appreciate waitstaff and probably don't tip, so I kind of understand why you'd rather try to get in some girl's pants than take three consecutive orders. Perhaps you, dear server, are better suited to working in an environment that doesn't require such distractions as doing one's job. And one might mistakenly presume that a restaurant would put its reputation on the line with the food that is served. Not the case at Padre's, whose view of \"modern\" is fast at the expense of flavor. Don't serve me rancid cheese on a stale tortilla and expect me to not be ticked off. I really don't give a hoot that it only costs $2.95; the cover should help absorb the phenomenal cost of serving edible food. Don't even get me started on a Mexican restaurant running out of Pacifico. Really? That's like any number of bars in the Valley running out of Bud Light. I won't tolerate it there, and I certainly won't accept that here. \n\nThe next time I want to hear good hip hop music, feel crowded in my seat and eat sub-par Mexican food, I'll strap on my Walkman, tune it to 98.3, hop on my bike and ride it through the drive through at Taco Bell, because this trip sucked. It sucked! \n\n* One star because my mother taught me if I don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all. Another star for the good music and company.
