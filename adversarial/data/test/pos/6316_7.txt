This place is getting 5 stars because they are open LATE!  Nothing is more frustrating than getting into town late and hungry for some good food only to find out all the places close at 10 or 11.  I know its VEGAS and supposed to be a 24 hour town but for anything besides fast food that it not the case. We were please to find out this place was still open after midnight and that they had some pretty nice things on their menu. Unfortunately after walking so far and being frustrated with those annoying people on the strip who just stop in the middle of the path or road, I didn't opt for very healthy or really a real food choice for my dinner.  I wanted a milkshake earlier so when I saw they had spiked milkshakes and a peach one, I was sold! My friend and I both ended up getting a Fuzzy the Bear milkshake spiked with peach schnapps YUMMY indeed.  It was decent sized but didn't last very long. I would have loved that extra metal container to refill that bad boy.  For my dinner I opted for fried pickles and they were very good and plenty of them it they certainly hit the spot. My friend was much better than me and got a chicken salad and it looked really good but I just need some fried treats with my milkshake dinner :)  I would have gotten a burger if they offered a unique vegetarian patty option but I didn't see that so that left room for the shake so it all worked out.
