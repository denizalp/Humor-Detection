This place was recommended so I tried it. I love the way the lanterns light up the outside and have passed it several times. So I was familiar with the place.\n\nPROS: The lighted tree path to the spa\n             A private room \n\nCONS: Massage was robotic and rub-a-dubbish\n            Getting a look of disgust for giving a $6.00 tip\n            The masseuse left 3 times during the massage \n            for whatever reason (but came back within 30 seconds).\n            The sign on the wall that says $5.00 = \"unhappy\" [tip]
