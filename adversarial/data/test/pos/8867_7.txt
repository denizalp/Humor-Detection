I wish there was a body shop closer to me, but the one in fashion show mall is it for now. \nStopped in here while going back to school shopping for my daughter. \nI didn't really intend to buy much, but it has been a long time since I've been to the body shop and I remembered all the wonderful things I like there. \nPlus, I was introduced to some new scents and products  as well. \nI love that many of their products are vegan, and everything is cruelty free. \nThe lady that was helping us was really kind and helpful and had a British accent that was just awesome. I mean- she was really, really genuinely friendly and helpful. \nI spent about $60 and got a lot of things that I was all excited about. This has definitely been one of my better sales experiences anywhere in a while! \nThe body shop definitely earned five stars for me for this.
