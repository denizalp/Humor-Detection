I needed a new catalytic converter for my corvette. It has 161,000 miles on it, and the cats were old and starting to throw in-efficiency codes up. I wanted a magnaflow direct fit, and these guys were a dealer for magnaflow. I also wanted a shop to inspect, and do any diagnostics on car to ensure that there was not some other underlying problem that may have contributed to original cats failing. (cat mfrs do not want to warranty new cats unless this is done.) I wanted to avoid having to possibly keep buying a new catalytic converter over and over again if there is something causing the failure other than old age. During original conversation, owner ryan did not seem willing to do any diagnostics, but was willing to order the part and install it. I agreed, and did not push the issue, because this shop seems to specialize in powder coating wheels, and putting in exhaust systems, and other custom work. \n This shop seems like they are more artisticly oriented. Not sure how good they are on diagnostics, or day to day repairs. They also only offer a 6 month warranty on parts only, not labor. \nI did take a few steps to ensure a successful outcome, such as buying new donut gaskets from the chevy dealer, and new flange nuts which are top lock one time use only, that wont come loose. I also inspected the system myself for exhaust leaks or obvious damage. I still need to take my car to a regular shop, and ask for a engine compression test, and a leakdown test, to see if oil or coolant is getting into exhaust. (probably not because I would notice coolant or oil loss of some sort.)\nHere are some things I like about the shop.\nSomewhat friendly people.\nPrices seem good\nshop seems well equipped with tools.\nNo up-selling pressure\nlots of examples of their custom work with wheels, and cool cars everywhere. \nLooks like they take pride in their work. (at least when it comes to their own cars.)\n\nThings I did not like.\n The warranty. Warranty is for parts only, not labor. warranty is only 6 months. What kind of crap is that? I dont need a warranty on the parts, because the mfr provides that, which is 5 years. Now if the mechanic installs the part incorrectly, and the part fails due to that, a good shop would stand behind their work, get the new part from the mfr, and help the customer out.\nThese guys did install the new gaskets I provided, but not the new flange nuts I provided. I have to get a new set of nuts and put them in myself, or risk them coming loose over time, and maybe letting air leak into cats, and destroying them. if I did not provide new gaskets, they sure as hell would wind up using old gaskets. Not a good sign of a good mechanic. Those gaskets should be replaced whenever the exhaust is removed. Nuts are also one time use, and designed that way. \n6651 does not seem to care about any of that. Hell they dont warranty the work they do anyway. if the repair or part goes bad, too bad for the customer. if the mechanic is having a bad day and does a sloppy i dont care job on youre car, too bad for you.\n warranty card from magnaflow. cat mfrs typically have a warranty card to be signed by the shop, and customer. It certifys that the part was installed by a proffessional, and that the proffessional did any tests or diagnostics to ensure the part wont fail due to other problems. \n6651 customs left that on the floor with the trash. I had to hunt it down and get the owner to sign it. If the part fails on me, I will be going directly to the mfr, and not deal with this shop. \n The manufacturer typically wont warranty a catalytic converter if a customer installs it himself. Kind of why I took my car to a shop instead of doing it myself. \nCore charge. if you ask to keep youre parts, they want a core charge. core charges are for parts that can be re-built like alternators, brake calipers, or motors. Not catalytic converters.(except if you are buying an oem cat from the chevy dealer, they want the old one back to maybe hack it up and re-build it.) But this does not apply to aftermarket cats. I highly doubt that magnaflow is demanding this shop to send them my oem cat. Magnaflow wont re-build it and sell it. They only sell new cats, and they only sell the cats they produce, not beat up old eoem cats. magnaflow cats can be bought from various parts stores. Those parts stores do not demand a core charge for cats. \n  Just a way to scam some easy cash. \nIf you are looking for artistic oriented type work, this place may be for you. If you are looking for regular repairs, or a place that pays attention to details that ensure a good solid repair, you might want to avoid this shop. Plenty of other shops that provide some sort of warranty on the work they do, even if it is only a year.
