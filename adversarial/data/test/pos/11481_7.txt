Awesome!\n\nRead all the good reviews about this buffet and decided to give it a try. I recommend coming 30 mins prior to when you'd like to be seated. Upon arrival you will see a kiosk asking you how many are in your party and some other questions. It will print out a ticket for your party. When we visited, there was quite a line before entering. You will pay prior to entering, the dinner buffet price was about $58\/person. It's definitely pricey, but since this was our first time here, we decided why not. The buffet had a lot to offer. The crab legs, prime rib, beef brisket, and the dessert section were some of my faves. Our server Marvin was the sweetest. He was attentive, friendly, and really made our experience here all the more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, we had a lovely dinner here and the company can't be beat :D
