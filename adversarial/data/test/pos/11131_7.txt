I am almost irritated that it took me so long to find the U of I Arboretum, which is well on its way to becoming my sanity restorer.\n\nThe Arboretum was officially opened in 1994 as the culmination of a larger project, but it is very much a work in progress in southern Urbana, with expanding park lands, tree plantings and beautiful gardens.  It's a great biking\/hiking\/walking area for noticing the local foliage and wandering for a spell.  On top of that, the Arboretum is also home to the Japan House, a tea house and three stage Japanese-style garden that hosts Japanese cultural programs and tea ceremonies on a regular basis.  When life drives me a little insane, it's best to regain some peace and sure-footing by sitting and looking over the clear blue of the small park pond, framed by the Japan House and the beautiful rows of trees in the distance.\n\nThank God for this arboretum, which is my de-toxifying alternative to all of the insanity that is graduate studies.  Huzzah.
