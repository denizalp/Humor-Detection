First---it is a sight to behold. So worth the trip. These monstrous granite mountains in the middle of the desert with an impressively large fake lake stuck in the middle of it.  The whole scene looks fake, like a cheap oil painting at a yard sale, but it's for real. Like the whole area it's this dynamic tussling relationship between the brute force of nature vs. the brute force of man.\n\nSo...no offense intended. And I really am sorry to sound like a snob. However, people from other parts of the country might relate to my observations, and I want to give them a heads-up.  Lake Mead is sort of a white-trash paradise. Think big powerboats, jet skis, men with giant stomachs and spindly little legs in striped wifebeaters and a gun sticking out of their cargo shorts. Like a 21st Century Yosemite Sam, without the rad facial hair and headgear swag, or style. Just that body type, bad temper, and red faces. They have with them sometimes large but not always, but always loud, crass, overly made-up wives or women with hardened faces. Overfed kids spilling out of their clothing hauling around super soakers if they're boys and snack foods if they're girls.  \n\nTho the above sort of dominates the \"regulars\" scene, people of all walks of life and ethnicities are there--which is pretty great, an American melting pot--and you'll see and hear everything from Indians, to Chinese, to Korean, to Middle Eastern to South and Central American, and African cultures and people----but all seem to run along the lines of loud messy (lots of ass-cracks exposed and bellowing back and forth to each other), and uncouth.\n\nThe carp are everywhere in abundance and the aforementioned folks are feeding them. Like, anything---Doritos, cookies, candy cars, Cheetos--and these grotesque creatures hoover them down, gigantic and nauseating, 4 feet long with human-sized gaping grabbing yearning Mick Jagger mouths, all crowding and pushing each other out of the way, while the humans on the docks feverishly do the same.\n\nIt is broiling hot (it is the desert, after all), the water somehow looks unclean, the beach is made of sharp rocks and few people swim. The restaurants are from 1987.  Really astonishing.  Not interesting tho...I thought I'd get a kick out of it, but it was just sad and boring. Nice down to earth wait staff tho.\n\nI'm from both coasts and have spent time on the Great Lakes, so I'm probably spoiled. But for anyone else who may be...just a heads-up.   It's sort of a descent into a cheerful and high-spirited but somewhat fetid pool of humanity.
