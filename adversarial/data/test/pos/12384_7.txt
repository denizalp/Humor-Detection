This place will harrass you privately, and threaten you for bad reviews. THEY WILL ALSO complain to Yelp, to have bad reviews pulled down.  This is the second posting of this review, changed a bit so as not to offend a certain special needs community. It was not meant to harm anyone, or single out anyone. I use colorful speech. I feel embarrassed that the owners feel the need to harrass people over reviews.  There is nothing famous here, you are better off buying and burning your own pizza.\nI could not finish but two slices of this burnt out pizza pie. \n\nOnto the original review, slightly changed....\n\nI was very sad to see \"the old pizza joint\" leave. I walked in after the change of ownership and chatted with one of the owners. She is very easy to talk to, she is very excited about getting this place off the ground. \n\nAs I sat and talked with her, I noticed all the pizza's coming out of the oven were burnt. Respectfully I asked her to not burn mine, and take it out before the cheese and toppings burn. I guess she didn't catch it in time, I ended up with a burnt pop tart flavored pizza. The other owner tried to convince me that it was not burnt. My definition of burnt differs from his. Burnt cheese and crust that is charred and blackened is burnt. Maybe if they switched to \"blackened pizza\" it would pass with flying colors. The other owner said she could remake it, but it already took a half hour of me sitting there waiting for the first one. That would have been an hour, and I doubt she or he could figure out the new oven. What a waste of time, I ended up chucking the pie.after two miserable blackened pieces. It is that bad when a yellow lab sniffs it and walks away. I guess I have one up on the dog, I at least attempted to consume it. I hope they sign 6 months leases, as i suspect they will be shutting down in a hurry.
