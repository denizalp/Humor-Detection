Who doesn't want to pretend like they're in the arctic while donning oversized puffy jackets, sipping out of ice cups and sitting on ice blocks?\n\nOk so I get that this is totally a novelty - and probably something I wouldn't do anytime except for when I'm on a totally sober vacation to Vegas. It's not cheap (but then again, what is cheap on the strip?), and it's freaking freezing, but it's still kind of cool. \n\nMy friends and I decided the sound of enjoying cocktails in a bar made completely out of ice was too intriguing to pass up, so we hit up Minus 5 one afternoon during our Vegas vacay. We each chose the entry +2 drinks package, which included entry into the ice bar, a parka, boots, gloves, and 2 alcoholic beverages. At $37 (plus tax), was it truly worth it? I don't know. What I do know is that my drinks were strong, my fingers were frozen, and I have a super cool photo to show for it. \n\nOne thing of note - I was surprised by how small the actual bar is itself, although I suppose it makes sense that a gigantic ice bar would be really expensive to build and maintain. We didn't go during a prime party hour, but there were only a few other people at the bar while we were there. Needless to say, we didn't stay long. We did, however, stay long enough to finish our drinks and get our fix of a cold climate.\n\nWhen in Rome... err, Vegas!
