Never Disappoints\n\nIt has been quite some time since I last visited Black Angus Steakhouse.  However, today my sister and I were craving steak for lunch and Black Angus has the absolute best lunch specials when you have a hankering for steak.\n\nBlack Angus offers an extensive menu and well prepared food at a reasonable price.  The drink menu is great, and the beer is cold on tap.  We seldom have to wait very long for a table and food is served promptly.\n\nOn this visit my sister had a medium rare sirloin steak with grilled roasted corn and a loaded baked potato and raved about it. I had a filet mignon sandwich with grilled onions and roasted red peppers.  The filet mignon was the most tender steak I've ever had, as well as being flavorful, both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection, just as we had ordered them.  \n\nPrior to our entr√©e we were served a small loaf of bread which was delicious and hot from the oven. The bread was hot, crusty, and soft on the inside.  I could have ate the entire loaf myself, but decided to share.  The deserts at Black Angus are to die for, however, we usually take ours home to enjoy later. \n\nOur server was amazing.  Once seated our drinks were served within a few minutes and we were given   a lunch discount card (8.99 for each lunch meal with the purchase of a drink) The Manager at Black Angus knows how to make the customer feel special. During most recent visit, the manager cleared plates,  assisted with getting our desert ready for leaving, and made sure our dining experience was a pleasant one.\n\nWe have never had a bad experience at Black Angus and plan to return every time we get the chance.
