I guess I love my life...maybe I hate it... I'm not sure yet (@Jen K, Canchi M, Wayne C)\n\nAhem, alright so admittedly last night I ventured into the city for some Southern style fare... I'm not sure how best to write this review so I'm going to let this restaurants song namesake performed by Bill Withers tell the tale (with my own spin) - it makes NO sense at all but i thought it was fun....\n\nHARLEM - BY BILL WITHERS (PERFORMED BY KRIS U)\n\nFall evening in Harlem, man it's a really cookin\nWell it's too early to sleep, and I'm too hungry...i need to EAT\nI don't what I'll eat as long as its Southern Fried Chicken\n\nThe other night in Harlem\nLights were red and dim\nWell the staff was friendly, and super awesome\nRecco'd the Miles Davis Cocktail - So strong it was a Sin\n\nWesnesday night in Harlem, everything's \"alright\"\nLive Jazz upstairs means you can really swing and shake you're pretty\nEverything's \"alright\"\n\nThursday morning not in Harlem, the Mac and Cheese resides\nWhile my hip bones aint showing..my belly is sticking out\nMac and Cheese and collard greens were the sides\nProbably could used a little more salt\nOverall a good experience but not a 4 star\nHey, hey lawd, honey give your money to that southern fried chicken man.\n\nTranslation: Fried Chicken was pretty good...nice crisp, not as greasy as some said. However just adding Thai sweet chili sauce was kind unoriginal. The mac and cheese was bland but the collard greens were ok\n\nMiles Davis Cocktail - OVERPROOF RUM and mixed juices. Strong and ....strong\n\nGood ambiance though. Overall - I'd go back and try some other menu items.\n\n25\/30
