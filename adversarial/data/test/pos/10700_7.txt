I love the clothes in Aritzia. The service I can do without.\n\n I am one of those shoppers who only likes to be greeted and then left alone. I like to look around, grab the things I need and then to try things on. If its a good fit, I buy and then go. Easy concept.\n\nI don't like to be bugged or followed around. Let me just shop.\n\nI find the staff at this location hit and miss. Ethier they are friendly and great or just miserable and want nothing to do with you. I find at stores who sell expensive items, service is usually great so it always boggles my mind why this store the service isn't consistent? \n\nThey do have great items and always very on trend, it's just too bad the staff isn't better at this location. Maybe it will be one day? No idea?
