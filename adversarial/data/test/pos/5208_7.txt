Glazier's boasts that they are the best grocery store in Las Vegas. I couldn't find a reason to disagree with this statement. Shopping here is very interesting compared to the regular grocery store. I wish that when a co-worker told me about Glazier's two years ago that I had stopped in immediately. So much goodness I've been missing.\n\nThe store reminds me slightly of a conventional version of Whole Foods. They have so many extras over a regular grocery store. The coffee\/tea bar, gelato, cakes, Italian cookies from NY, donuts, prepared foods, salad bar, and so much more. The prepared foods were items I'd really want to buy too. They had sides like green bean casserole! I like that they have an area of tables for those that want to enjoy breakfast or lunch at the store. \n\nStore offerings aren't limited to cool stuff, they have the usual grocery items too. A full produce section, dairy case, and aisles of shelf items. The fish and meat department was the largest I've ever seen at a store. The store seemed like a grocery store plus to me. They carry everything the regular grocery store carries plus more items. Every aisle had brands I recognize, but flavors and options I didn't even know existed. They even import homemade pasta from New York and a wide selection of it.\n\nAisles and cases are clean and well organized. Items are all well priced and fully stocked. The aisles are wide. Everything about this store from the selection to the presentation of the store is inviting. \n\nMy absolute favorite part of this store is that they import homemade pasta and cookies from New York. I've looked for true Italian bakery cookies since moving here and finally I found them!
