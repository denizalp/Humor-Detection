It is my recommendation that you never go to Orient Kitchen! While the food is on the pricier side for local Chinese restaurants, the large issue at hand is the horrible woman who runs the place. I have never experienced someone in the serving industry speak and treat customers so rudely!\n \nOrient Kitchen is near to my apartment so I often go with friends. The aforementioned woman is usually pretty rude but whatever. Last visit, I went alone to pick up take out and I was upcharged simply because she thought she could take advantage me not knowing that I fully comprehend Chinese.\n \nMy friend politely asked her why that happened to me while we were ordering tonight and she proceeded to say that if we are so poor we shouldn't be eating in her restaurant. She went on to say that she's rich and has a big house and doesn't care if we are in her restaurant or not. She didn't leave it there, she went on to the next table to talk about us. Jokes on you lady! You just talked shit about me to my friends who also happened to be eating, haha!\n\nOh yeah lady, one more thing, careful when you talk about customers in front of their faces. Some of us white people can speak Chinese too. I know what you said about me.\nYou've been warned.\n\n1 star but should really be 0.0000000001 stars.
