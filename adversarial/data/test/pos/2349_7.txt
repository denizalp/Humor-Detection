I have NEVER had a good experience at ANY of the pickle barrel restaurants. People who are giving them anything above a 1 star ratings either don't get to eat out much or have no taste buds and no sense of smell. AFter a few consistently bad experiences , I have made an effort to actively avoid this establishment.
