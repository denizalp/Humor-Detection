Very frustrating experience.\n\nI came here to get my passport photo done. I walked up to the counter that had a giant overhead sign that said, \"PHOTO\" on it. I waited for 10 minutes as I watched cashiers and the manager chit-chatting behind the counter. I kept smiling, but they just looked away. Talking about whatever they did over the weekend was much more important. Finally, I had to say, \"Excuse me?!\" rather loudly because of the volume of their conversation. The manager turned my way and said, \"Oh! Has anyone helped you?\".\n\nFast-forward a couple minutes. The manager didn't know how to properly take the photo. She didn't tell me when she was taking it, and when I requested to see the photos she said, \"Oh. I already printed one.\" She made me wait then gave them to me, told me to go to the cashier's counter, and walked off.\n\nMy photo looks incredibly pissed off. Hopefully the consulate won't reject my Visa based on how angry I look, haha.\n\nOverall, annoying experience. I won't be using this CVS Pharmacy again (unless, of course, there is an apocalypse).
