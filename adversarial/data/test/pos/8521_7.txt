What a train wreck. Hostess was incompetent, and at one point just walked off in frustration. Literally said \"I can't handle this,\" and walked off.  She left a group of eight servers in her wake. Why eight servers were gathered around the hostess, God only knows. Can any of them \"handle this\"?  \n\nAlas, no...\n\nThe server was... Interesting.  I have never seen pitchers of soda served along with a separate pitcher of ice. That seemed weird, but turned out to be the best thought out part of the meal. \n\nWe were warned about the wait time for the meal, so that was nice. You're ordering deep dish pizza, and a wait is not altogether surprising. What is surprising is that when we got our pizzas, the temperature was uneven. Uneven, and no part was hot, at least as that term is commonly defined. Lukewarm?  That's being too generous. It varied from room temperature to tepid. Disappointing, especially at that price point. The reason given was that the cooks aren't leaving the pizzas in the oven long enough. Skimping on quality to deliver more quantity is a recipe for disaster. I won't be ordering from them any time soon. \n\nI hope they are just working out the kinks because they have a lot of overhead to cover. It's a really nice looking place. But if they don't get their shit together, then I don't know how they will survive.  I certainly won't be back any time soon. \n\nThey really need competent staff. Get rid of the clueless high schoolers and hire some people who know what they are doing. The place was chock full of young employees just milling about, some with a dead look in their eyes like they were just dropped onto Omaha Beach and are totally shell-shocked. \n\nOh, and the bathrooms were atrocious. For a new restaurant, that is unacceptable.
