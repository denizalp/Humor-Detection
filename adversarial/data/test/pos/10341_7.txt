Back in high school, I would've have gave this chain 5 stars.\n\nAs of recently, The customer service has decreased greatly; for the most part, One employee in-particular. I do not know his name, but he has been working there for over 5-6 years. I remember him at the store in chandler. Lately, in the past years; he has became an ass. To the point of insulting a close friend of mine while we were ordering. He is very pretentious and condescending. For this sole reason, I now prefer Starbucks of this establishment. Not all the baristas here are bad, I generally like the rest. Just continued abuse from this fucker has left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nBut I will say that the drinks are good and decently priced. Very social atmosphere. Wi-Fi and free computers to use. Was a regular for over 6-7years now. But now I avoid it like the plague. Won't be going back.
