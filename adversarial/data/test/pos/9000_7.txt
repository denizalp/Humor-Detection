Please, if you're thinking of going here, re-think your decision.  My gfs and I had a terrible uncomfortable time here.\n\nFirst of all, there's hardly any parking.  My 4 gfs and I came in 3 separate cars and not one of us could get a spot in their lot.  Other guests had already made their own parking spots wherever they could.  So even those artificial spots were taken.  We ended up having to park at the plaza across the street.  It's totally a buzzkill having to run across 4 lanes of traffic in wedges.  There's a light you could cross at, but it's so far. *eye roll  \n\nAnyways, I had a long standing craving for fish tacos, so I was pretty set on this. After we had put our orders through, the server came back not too shortly to let me know that the fish tacos were actually $25 that evening.  $25, are you crazy?!  It had something to do with the fish vendor and the type of fish.  I mean, it was really nice she let me know, because there was no way I was ordering $25 fish tacos.  Especially, at a resto that had less than impressive reviews.  I had read them before coming here, but didn't have the heart to tell my gfs, since they were pretty set on coming here.  So after she tells me this, I proceed to take a look at the menu once again.  She then starts to suggest things similar to the fish tacos, ie. shrimp tacos, octopus etc.  I then let her know I was allergic to shellfish.  Her attitude was totally rushed, as if IIII was inconveniencing her, while she is there hovering, waiting for me to make a decision.  Like girl, chill, can I get a moment?!  I told her she could just come back for my order and she tells me that the other girls need the till, so she needs to put the order through.  I let her know, that was fine, to put my gfs's order.  She then proceeds to tell me that it could take awhile for my order to be brought out, if she puts the order through separately.  Like how much later could it be?!?  Anyways, I ended up just getting some chicken taco or something.  I don't even remember because it was totally unmemorable, besides the fact that they were disgusting.  The second tortilla they use here is totally unnecessary, as they were rubbery, dry, bland.  An all around sad taco.  My gf thought the same thing.  I ate one and traded her for one of hers and left the third one.  I was not wasting my calories on those.  We had also ordered the poutine mexicana for the table and these were the only good thing for the night.  Drinks were okay too.\n\nJust when we thought it couldn't get worse, for some reason EVERY single server kept checking up on our table EVERY 5 minutes.  I'm not even joking.  The five of us were so annoyed.  Like YES, everything is okay.  It's still okay from when we were asked 5 minutes ago!  And why is everyone even asking us anyways?  They weren't serving us??  Maybe they were doing this to make up for the fact that we were very unimpressed.  Which in turn, just made things worse.\n\nMoral of the story is, don't go here.
