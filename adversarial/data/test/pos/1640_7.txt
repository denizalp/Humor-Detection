I went here for lunch a few weeks ago and ordered the butter chicken combo. I'm not too familiar with indian cuisine but the combo included naan and a bunch of other side dishes. I really liked the butter chicken and ended up finishing it really quickly because it was that good. At first I was sceptical of the portions because the plates made it look like there wasn't enough food, but the meal was actually very filling and unfortunately I wasn't able to finish everything. \n\nSome of my other friends didn't order combos and regretted it because having an entire bowl of biryani gets boring after a while, vs with the combo you get a nice variety of foods. If you're in the area and craving indian food, check this place out.
