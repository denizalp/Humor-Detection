Watched the UFC here on the weekend. Ten bucks to get in, ok, but where the hell was your extra security? \n\nThe main event featured a full on brawl at the bar. The poor doorman had no clue what to do. The bartender goes ninja flying over the bar to step in. A knock-out outside and a TKO on the TV inside. \n\nYou guys know how to put on a good fight in Calgary. Maybe splurge on a little extra security for the next UFC night. \nJust a thought.
