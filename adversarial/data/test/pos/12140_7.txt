I have been waiting.... for this place to open.  The newest addition to a quaint shopping center on Central that is bursting with fun shops.\n\nLola Coffee is exactly what we needed.  Awesome layout with retro-modern furnishings (looks like stuff from Red Modern) this place has a great vibe.  It's like going over to your coolest friends ultra fun studio.  Me and my bf ordered an americano, latte, blueberry muffin and cinnamon coffee cake.  Coffee was great... of course it would be the owners really know their stuff.  Original owners of Lux and Lola's Tapas... they were both there and such gracious hosts.\n\nWe sat down on a comfy couch in the back corner and enjoyed the artwork and liveliness of the crowd.  We skimmed a few magazines on the table.... something for everyone. The cinnamon coffee cake is a must try... I finished every last crumb.  Outside they have some patio seating complete with thoughtful hooks for your canine friends.  Can't wait to go back. I'll be the one with the little dachshund.
