Food: 3\nBeer: 0 \nAtmosphere: 3\nService: n\/a\nCulture: 2\n\nOverall = 3 stars\n\nI work a 9-5er in uptown (no I'm not calling it \"the city\" or \"city\"...Charlotte is more small town than big city to me.....even with a few skyscrapers...well, two that truly can scrape the sky so-to-speak....Sorry, I digress.\n\nSo I bumped into an old manager from my NationsBank days....yes, I'm also dating myself as does any banker that talks about banks they worked for and names you probably never even heard of....and we decided to do lunch at Jason.  This was a salad day for me...lots of meeting, so a big meal wasn't in the cards, unless I planned on falling half asleep in a meeting lasting hours and hours.  So I didn't get to experience the sandwich line, which wasn't a bad thing as it was almost out the door when we arrived around 11:40 in the morning?!?!?!\n\nI had never been here before, so I followed the lead of my acquaintance as he seems to have been here several times.  There are 2 self serve kiosks for soup\/salads, which had very small lines.  I ordered a salad with chicken...went over to my left to the counter where I was given a tray, empty white unbreakable plastic bowl and a small cup of cooked chicken.....though I've never been to prison...\"convicted....no.......never convicted\" I think I may have had a little taste of what it was liked being herded around like sheep with my prison like tray, bowl and fellow eaters all walking around in a well formed process.\n\nThe salad bar is good...though basic...nothing very creative here.  We ate, caught up on our work over the years and headed out.\nThe place itself sits on the second floor of the EPICENTER in the corner of College and 4th with lots of windows, so it is light and bright.  The food was fine...pricing wasn't anything special...total for lunch (with water) (was $9.26 with tax = Salad $6.99 + Chicken $1.49 + tax).\n\nFast....but only if you go the salad route....avg pricing, though $9 for lunch is not cheap if you eat out lunch every day.  All and all a generally good...can be quick depending....lunch spot in the center of town.
