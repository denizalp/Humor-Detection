Have you ever had a nice servicer who wasn't the great at serving? That explains my experience whenever I come to this location. I give three stars because the food is good quality but the service just isn't the best. One thing that's usually continuous is I never get wine samples nor the drink menu, because I look young, and of course I wouldn't ask for the sample seeing they are supposed to offer it; I also am swayed from buying drinks seeing that they don't offer it and I don't get a drink menu. Something I also notice is the servers attentiveness, they just aren't. I find myself with a empty glass often and I also never get another serving of soup or breadsticks by them noticing I always have to say something, which is annoying. Overall though the food was good as always.
