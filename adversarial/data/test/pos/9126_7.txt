I do not own a timeshare here. This is for their \"presentation\" that they lure people into while they stay at other hotels. \n\nWe were staying at Excalibur and walked by one of those \"free show\" tables. The representative told us we had to attend a presentation about a timeshare, which would only take 2 hours, and we would get free lunch and show tickets. We were hesitant, and finally agreed when they offered us cash along with it. We were told to be back in the hotel lobby early the next morning. \n\nSure, it seemed like a risk to give up part of our vacation, but seeing a free show would be something cool to do, and it was only 2 hours, right? (I'm sure you can see where this is going).\n\nWe took a shuttle bus far down Las Vegas Boulevard, close to the M resort. Why would anyone stay this far on a Vegas trip? From there, we were herded into a large room and then split into presentation rooms, with continental breakfast. A presenter gave us a LONG, condescending speech and PowerPoint about how important it is to take vacations. Nothing about the actual timeshare or costs until much later. We were assigned a salesman who sat with us during the whole thing, walked around with us afterward for the tour, and sat with us for another discussion of the financing options, giving us canned questions and lines the whole time. \n\nSure, it sounded like a reasonably good deal, but we couldn't afford it at the time and politely declined. The salesman seemed personally offended, then led us to another higher-up who tried another sales pitch and a better price. Again, not now, we said. But they were hell bent on selling it to us TODAY. After some small, dry sandwiches, we went to a third and final sales pitch with a rock-bottom price, but by this time we were frustrated and just wanted to leave end enjoy our weekend. However, they told us that the shuttle had to take everyone back to the hotel together, and we couldn't leave without the rest of the group and not before talking to everyone they wanted us to talk to. \n\nFinally, we collected our show tickets and cash and went back to the hotel...... after 5-6 hours. Not the 2 hours that they said. Pretty much half our Saturday, on our vacation weekend that we don't get many of. Needless to say, we were pretty upset. And the show, Criss Angel, sucked too, especially with the crappy back-row seats they gave us. Do not go here unless you have a LOT of free time on your hands, don't mind wasting it, or actually want a timeshare but with something free in the process. No one likes to feel like a sucker, even if they only thing they took was time.
