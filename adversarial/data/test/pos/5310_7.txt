I went here the other day and was very satisfied with the cut I received. I was a little worried that I might get something a bit K Pop considering I was the only white person in the salon for the hour I was there, but my stylist knew exactly what he was doing and gave me a great haircut without me needing to guide him pretty much at all. He even gave me a bit of a head rub when he washed my hair. Would definitely go back. Asian hair salons are definitely the way to go for the price and quality of service. \n\nThe place was a little hard to spot at first so look closely for a doorway or at the second floors for signs if you're having trouble.
