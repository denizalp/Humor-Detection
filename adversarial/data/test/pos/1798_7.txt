Holy workout of all workouts, Batman! I admit that I have a spin bike and I seldom use it, unless I'm entirely desperate for cardio. I usually use my kettle bells and do other workouts but I wanted something fun, and this covered it.\n\nI signed up online for the N.W.A vs Icecube class with a girlfriend of mine and we went and we were not prepared for all the cute goods they had in the front. The class itself at first made me feel like dying, that feeling you get when you're running for a while and your lungs are screaming at you to go sit back down and eat a cupcake? No? Maybe thats just me then. Towards the middle I got used to the bike and was super happy I even made it through the whole class. It was a great work out and was super high energy. I hope to get back in here again soon!
