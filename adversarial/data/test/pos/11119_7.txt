For a while, I had The Martini bookmarked and labeled as, \"To Try: Fish & Chips.\" As tempting as it was to order fish & chips when I visited, I didn't. Resisting the urge to indulge in a basket of deep fried delicacies, I chose the \"healthier\" route and ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich with a side of of house fries instead of the optional sweet potato fries and house salad. The sandwich wasn't bad. It was just an ordinary fish sandwich with greens and cheese. If it wasn't for the wasabi cream, it would've been dull.\n\nThe drinks are cheap and range from $8-$14, depending on what you order. My dining companion ordered a martini called \"The Hummingbird\" for its Elderflower Liqueur. The drink was presented to her in what appeared to be a laboratory beaker. It was a little bubbly, and it had a pleasant and light sweetness. \n\nOur server was excellent. Granted, my friend and I were the only two people in their dining room, but she came by often to see how we were doing. She even encouraged us to return the following day to checkout a few Chippendales dancers who were going to be serving drinks to ladies. Not really my cup of Ovaltine, but that was nice of her to inform us. \n\nThe Martini is a fine neighborhood bar with fantastic service and decent food. I'll have to return when I feel like clogging my arteries with their fish & chips.
