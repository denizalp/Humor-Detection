Well, it's been a good run with Dr. Kim, but I'm afraid he's moving on to bigger and better. Great for him, but leaves his patients feeling a bit \"stranded\" while they hurry to establish relationships with new providers for their chronic health issues. \n\nDr. Kim's practice recently sent out a notice to patients offering them an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of his new \"MDVIP\" practice, which would potentially cost patients upwards of 2 grand per year, but would ensure them a more \"personalized\" and thorough care plan. The new business model will start in May, leaving current patients who are not staying on without a primary care provider if they do not have other arrangements made. I see the benefit for Dr. Kim and his practice, but it feels a little like \"abandonment\" to someone who's been an established patient for 4 years. \n\nI always found it easy to get in to Dr. Kim for routine health visits, last minute sick visits, and I liked the convenience of bloodwork done on site. I liked his proximity to my home. Staff and reception were always helpful, although a little loud on the phone or at reception, sometimes bordering on violating HIPAA. \n\nOverall, it's been a good experience, but the new business model seems gimmicky and money-grabbing. Moving along....
