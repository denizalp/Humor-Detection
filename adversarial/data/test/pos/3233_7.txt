I got Botox and Lip filler here. Botox was fine. I had lip injections prior to visiting this office and left left here with extremely uneven lips. They were nice enough to allow me to come back to fix them, however, my lips looked even worse after two more visits. So now I have crooked lips. They look OK with filters or if I'm smiling but unfortunately I don't spend most of my days smiling or taking selfies.
