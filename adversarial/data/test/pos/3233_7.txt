Let's hope you never, N E V E R  E V E R, have to visit any IRS offices.\n\nFirst of all, you need to make an appointment ahead of time to see any agent.\n\nI tried calling once, after wasting a trip here, and that wait time was literally 40 minutes before you can speak to a live person. My old iPhone battery was pretty much dead after that call. Pretty sure I had an above average dose of cellular phone radiation exposure just from that call.\n\nCall this number if you need \"face to face\" service at one of the IRS offices. 1-844-545-5640\n\nAlso without an appointment, the security guards outside may not even let you go inside and get scan like you are going through an airport screening check point (at least I did not have to take off my shoes).  The security guy working was nice enough to let me go in, but warned me that I will most likely be sent right back out, even though they were not busy (2 people waiting in the waiting area inside).\n\nAnd the receptionist did tell me that it is by appointment only and gave me Form 15006 (SP) for CÃ³mo programmar una cita. My Spanish is horrible, but luckily the English version is on the back, and Form 15006 is instructions on \"How to Schedule an Appointment\".\n\nAnyway, if you do have to come here in person, I highly suggest NOT parking at the garage at this building. $5 for every 30 minutes is not worth it.  Try parking at California or Main Street casino and grab something to eat at one of the restaurants to get your parking stub validate. That short walk over will be worth at least $5.\n\nAlso there are signs letting you know that no cameras or cell phones can be used inside. So don't get in trouble for something like that.\n\nPeace out!
