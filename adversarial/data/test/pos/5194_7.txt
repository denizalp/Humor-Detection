A GEM!  A small hotel sandwiched by Flamingo and Bally's, smack-dab in the middle of the strip.  Stayed here because it was the cheapest we could find for the location...what a great decision.  \n\nYou probably have that one random person in your group of friends that has heard of Bill's, and that person always loves it.  Bill's is known for cheap gambling. \n\nGOOD stuff:\n-LOCATION.  You could not ask for a better, spot, literally on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Flamingo.  \n-NO LONG WALKS.  Because the hotel is small, it takes like 3 minutes to walk from your room to outside the casino on the strip.  This is a huge deal...ladies in heels, you know what I'm talking about.  When you're drunk and in heels, every step counts!\n-POOL.  Free access to the pool at Flamingo!\n-FOOD.  Famous $6.99 steak and eggs special, only at night though\n-ROOMS.  Nice clean rooms with big flat-screen TVs\n-STAFF.  Great staff overall...very real and friendly\n-SHOW TICKETS.  Tix 4 Tonight, the best place to get half-off show tickets, has a location right in Bill's lobby, and for those of you who know what this is, you know how long and painful that line can get, so you have a nice opportunity to get there early.\n-BIG ELVIS.  I didn't see him personally, but apparantly Big Elvis is a big hit here!\n-ATMOSPHERE.  Nice laid-back atmosphere...it's really refreshing.  With all the glitz and glam of the strip, sometimes you just want to sit down in the casino in your PJ's and gamble, without feeling too judged. \n\nNOT-SO-GOOD stuff:\n-I called room service for a couple of extra pillows and they said there were literally NO PILLOWS which just doesn't sound right to me.\n-The rooms and hallways had a very slight but noticeable ODOR...I have a sensitive nose, so maybe it's not too bad to others, but I can best describe it as a mix between a fart and an Egg McMuffin from McDonalds.\n\nIf you like the atmosphere of Downtown but want to stay in the middle of the strip, THIS is your spot.
