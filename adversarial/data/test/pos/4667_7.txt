Villa La Paws is an amazing place for your four-legged bff.\n\nVLP offers boarding, grooming, pet training and more. I have primarily been a customer of the training dept. and grooming, but I wouldn't hesitate to use the boarding services.\n\nTo start with, Wendi is the most amazing dog trainer ever. Wendi has experience training service dogs, search and rescue dogs, and agility\/ sporting related stuff. No offense to the big box dog stores where they offer training inside a 50x50 box near isle 5, but I don't want to learn from someone who has a Sally Struthers online training certificate. I need to trust and believe that the person who is teaching me knows her stuff, and Wendi is amazing. So patient, kind and smart, if she cannot help you with a dog issue, you are SOL.\n\nNext, the groomers at VLP are tremendous. They are sweet and really respect and care about the dogs they care for. It's pretty cool to see people who both enjoy what they are doing, AND have pride in their work. \n\nVLP has a very popular boarding program. Unlike other providers, VLP has cage free boarding. Many dogs dislike being confined in a crate, and at VLP, your dog is evaluated and put with like minded dogs. VLP is housed in a former school, and there are different converted classrooms for various types of dogs. If your dog is an old Bassett, they will be put with similar dogs, so rather than fight for their lives everyday while you're on vaca, they can relax and enjoy themselves too. Another cool thing is that every inch of VLP has cameras, and you can log into the net and see your dogs, 24\/7. How cool is that?\n\nTo recap, you cannot go wrong at VLP. Unless you're a cat, then you won't like it. Otherwise, if you love your four legged family member as much as me, you will be really happy with this gem.
