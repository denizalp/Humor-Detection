This is a great lounge. It's clean and well maintained with free beverages of all kinds and a great food bar. I've come to expect very little from lounges after spending a lot of time in the Admirals clubs and this is a welcome addition to the Vegas airport. Free Internet. A media room for small kids, nice bathrooms, and a great coffee machine. Did i mention the great food bar? Pretty awesome, thanks American Express!!
