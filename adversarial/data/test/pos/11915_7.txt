I have been a loyal customer since 1999. Makes me sad to right a bad review but since high schools closed their campuses Steves place has deteriorated tremendously. I went in as usual for lunch ordered my sub and returned to work with the wrong sandwich. I ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items. I called spoke with a nice man who said come in I will write ur name down. I did and 4 people playing around in the back told me I need to speak with owner which I said no problem and their response was he is out of town. They all thought it was funny and I was so upset. If Steve's crazy sub ever goes out of business it will be because of the horrible customer service from his teenage and one grown man who seem to not care if customers ever comeback. Steve please read this and several others I have read that your staff needs to go. I hope someday I will be treated as a customer and maybe even get the sub I paid for.
