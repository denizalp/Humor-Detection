Why is Tao averaging only 3 stars, I had a great experience. It's smaller than other major clubs in Vegas, but still fun if you want to venture on smaller venues (or just stop by for open bar before hitting the bigger clubs). I had to stop by here being in Vegas because whenever I introduced myself anywhere, I always get the response \"your name is a club in Vegas\" so I thought I had to visit the club that was named after me, just kidding. \n\nThis was my first ever club in Vegas so I was already impressed at how much it is shitting on Seattle's clubs. The decor is cute, classy yet trendy, whatever that means right. I had fun making new friends here that thought it was funny that they are meeting Thao at Club Tao. During the day, I think this is an asian fusion restaurant because you had to walk through the restaurant part of the place to get to the clubbing part.
