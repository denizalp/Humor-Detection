Completely and totally unimpressed and quite disappointed.  The sushi is low quality (I'm quite the sushi nut) and the prices are quite high.  The place was dirty and the staff was rude and non attentive.  \n\nThe food itself lacks taste and was put together really quickly.  \n\nWe got the Vegas, Tootsie, Philadelphia and salmon rolls and usually are quite happy with that selection in other establishments but wished we would have just gone somewhere entirely different.
