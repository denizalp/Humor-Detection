AMC's are all over California.  We only have two in Vegas and both are not in a casino, which is a huge plus. This AMC has 18 theaters and I believe a few of them have the reclining luxury seats.  I have watched a few flicks here and have no complaints about my comfort, screen size, and surround sound.  Like the rest of the theaters around town, expect to pay a grip for a movie ticket and snacks.  Or, you can watch a movie prior to 12 PM and pay only $5.29 (matinee price).  I'm a huge fan of watching movies. I'm a fan of watching movies at AMC. I am an even bigger fan of saving money.  $5.29 is a deal!!
