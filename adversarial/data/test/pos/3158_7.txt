Hip space located in the centre of Kensington Market. Excellent selection of baked goods, juices, drinks and coffees to choose from. \n\nStaff is approachable and organized despite the usually long lineups. \n\nOn a good day, head to the back of the store and find a seat on their outdoor patio. Its a great vibe, and an oasis in Kensington market. The walls contain artwork featuring all the great Jimmy's. (Hendricks and Morrison) and an old Vespa with blown out tires makes for a European mood when you enter. \n\nCoffees are reasonably priced.
