We called Pioneer to purchase a new garage door opener.  The man who answered the phone was very terse and condescending.   Due to a lack of better judgement we proceeded to purchase our garage door opener through Pioneer.  Their website advertises a free keypad with the purchase of the garage door.  They installed the garage door with no keypad. When I called the office regarding the keypad the woman who answered the phone said that was only  a promotion if you called in a mentioned it.  After going back and forth about honoring the offer displayed on their website, she said she'd mail it to us. Also, the installation wasn't performed properly, the very first day we had an error code on our panel.\n\nFour months later the garage has been having issues with closing.  This is a brand new opener and already it's having issues.  There is an error message displaying on the panel. Naturally we called Pioneer and they're telling us that the sensors aren't aligned. I was not convinced that this was the issue because if you just wait a few minutes the door would go down.  My husband tried their solution the door went down but the next time he used the door (an hour later) same problem.\n\nThe owner responded to the call with major attitude and threatened to charge us the next time he came out. \n\nI've never encountered a business owner so pissed off about having new business.  Furthermore, I implore anyone who's reading this to consider a company who values their clientele.  Pioneer Overhead Door surely does not.  They will never get another dollar of mine.
