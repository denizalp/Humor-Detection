Ideal place to stay for groups! \n\nI came to Vegas for my 21st birthday a few months ago so of course I had to stay somewhere amazing for this experience! Palazzo did not disappoint! I was definitely impressed!  \n\nLet's start off this review discussing [CHECK-IN] ... we were able to check in a little after noon on a Saturday, and the line was only about 10 people long. A kind attendant was monitoring the line was handing out coupons for some free drink at Restaurant Charlie and doing some small talk so it wasn't so bad. I, personally, was actually intoxicated beyond the point of being able to complete the whole checking-in transaction (aka, I had to yack into a receptacle right on the floor at the front desk), but they were very helpful at continuing along with my friends so I could clamor up to a room as quick as possible, haha!     \n\nOur group of 5 girls fit just right in a [LUXURY SUITE] for a great price of $159! Including tax it was only about $173 total, which is pretty good for a weekend rate that's split between the 5 of us! And on top of that, we used an awesome promotion called \"Ultimate Escape\" which included:\n    * Luxury Suite at The Palazzo\n    * $50 in Slot Credits\n    * LAVO Restaurant-Lounge-Nightclub Package:\n      - $50 drink voucher\n      - Complimentary admission and line pass for up to 4 guests \n\nhttp:\/\/www.palazzolasvegas.com\/pal_luxury_suite.aspx\nCheck out the link above for the list of features and amenities that each suite provides. It's more than any typical person would need when staying a night in Vegas! The 1-bed Luxury Suite was fine for us since the big comfy bed would fit 3, and then the L-shaped sofa fit 2. Plus... a 2-bed Bella Suite would have been $60 more at the time.  \n\nOur room was clean, looked new and was overall veryyyy nice. 720 sq ft is plenty enough room especially since there was no lack of counters, chairs, or floor space for all of our stuff. Loved the bathroom because it was so big, bright, and had plenty of mirror space for us to share, especially with the little vanity table aaand the large full-length mirror! Woohoo! The threeeeeee TV's were also a major plus so that we could all watch different things during lag time... or watch in one part of the room while someone else was passed out on the other side, haha. We had room service get extra pillows, towels, and blankets for us, and they were very quick to bring it all without asking any questions about why we needed so much extra stuff. \n\nIn terms of the actual hotel, we spent a good amount of time in the [CASINO] and some time in the shops but didn't have time to check out the restaurants, bars or the pool. The casino is kind of small, but we liked now it was divided by a straight walkway so that we could walk from the elevators to the front of the hotel without having to wind around endlessly and potentially get lost. There were plenty of cocktail waitresses walking around so that we were able to get more than enough of our share of yummy drinks while only gambling on the 1-cent or 5-cent machines. We also redeemed those Restaurant Charlie drink coupons for a fruit-wine concoction that was pretty strong for being free! \n\n[MISCELLANEOUS] Other than that... The Palazzo is beauuuutiful!!! The matching decor of the whole place was luxuriously classy from the marble floors to the statues to the chandeliers on the very high ceilings, but it was never to the point of being gaudy. Very picturesque, and I'll most likely be uploading some of my pictures from the trip when I get around to it. Loved the dimly-lit winding corridors to get from the elevators to our room. Yes, we noticed that sweet scent in the hotel as well, but we couldn't tell what it was. \n\nSelf-parking was easy and free. Because Palazzo is on a corner, their multi-level garage has an entrance both on Las Vegas Blvd as well as from Sands Ave. The latter of which is really convenient in avoiding traffic on the strip. There was always an abundance of cabs available at the front of the hotel as always, too, at both the upper and lower level driveways. There's one main tower of elevators, and they do check for room cards in the evening before going up. The shops were nice... but not appealing for our age group, and there were so many of them it took us forever to get all the way through to the Venetian. All the help seemed very friendly. Checking out slightly late was no problem. \n\nGood times! I'd definitely consider coming back here again with a group, especially since they have me on the mailing list for future rate promotions!\n\n*********************************************\n\nBy the way... I'm actually curious about if Palazzo is a 4-Diamond or a 5-Diamond hotel since it doesn't seem to be listed by AAA for 2009... anyone know?\n\nList of 4-Diamond hotels for 2009 \nhttp:\/\/www.aaa.com\/aaa\/aaadiamonds\/2008_4D_lodging.pdf\n\nList of 5-Diamond hotels for 2009\nhttp:\/\/www.aaa.com\/aaa\/aaadiamonds\/2008_5D_lodging.pdf\n\n*******************************************
