I normally don't review these types of places, but my experience with them was poor enough that I'd be remiss if I didn't say something. \n\nCalled them up and asked if they sold shovels, was told they have all kinds. Asked if they specifically stocked irrigation shovels and I get, \"Well, we have shovels for irrigation,\" which is not really an answer. Strike one.\n\nSo I clarify that I'm looking for a specific kind of shovel called an irrigation shovel, also known as a caprock shovel, I explain. Awkward silence ensues, after which I explain in detail what a caprock shovel is, looks like and what you use it for. Still no dice, it was like I was speaking in tongues or something. Strike two.\n\nFinally, at an impasse, I was then referred to their website to look up the part #, which isn't even possible since there's no such mechanism on their website. Strike three.\n\nFor a place that touts itself as having all things irrigation and being a fount of knowledge (no pun intended), they really need to get a clue. For a store in the irrigation supply business, much less one who sells shovels, it is incredibly disappointing (not to mention counter intuitive) that they don't stock any actual irrigation shovels. That they don't even know what one is, that's just ridiculous.
