If I could give this place a zero star I probably would. Why? Horrible, unprofessional customer service..\n\nWe originally stopped by here because some of my friends wanted to do Karaoke. First, my friend got cut off after buying a round of shots. When he came up to the bar to get more drinks they told him he was cut off. Um why? Secondly, we were here for about an hour, we all went outside on the patio and a guy comes out on his smoke break, I'm assuming he was the bartender. Looks at me and my girl friend, and says I need to see your ID and yours. First of all, I don't care about getting carded, but why isn't anyone else getting carded. I asked him, why weren't we carded the minute we walked in? He said because they don't have a bouncer. Why would you card us an HOUR later after we've all already ordered drinks. The way he approached us about it was what really got to me. \n\nNeedless to say I'll never be back..
