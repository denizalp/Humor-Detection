Another gem in Coronado, a lovey brunch spot that closes at 2.  You order right at the counter and they bring the food to you when it's finished.  I went with the Shepard's Biscuit and my wife ordered the Crispy Breakfast Naan Bread.  \n\nThe Shepard's Biscuit was good, how can you go wrong with applewood smoked bacon, Italian sausage, and brisket on a flaky biscuit with cheese and guacamole!  There was just a small portion of avocado, it would of been nice with either more guacamole or some type of sauce. Some of the bites were dry and not nearly as tasty as the bites that had guac.\n\nThe Crispy Breakfast Naan Bread was very tasty.  It was made with all fresh ingredients. Although the naan bread was not very crispy, it was still very yummy.\n\nThe price was affordable, both our meals were priced around $8 each.
