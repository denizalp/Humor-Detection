My Superstore of choice used to be the one in Deerfoot Meadows, but over time my family noticed it seemed to be really and the clientele at this location wasn't helping. We went to the one in Shawnessy but it was under construction and completely confusing in regards to where anything was. The one by Southland Dr. also felt dirty for a grocery store. \n\nThis location is completely out of the way, but my family needed to buy some groceries and we were in the area, so we went here. This location is like every single location in regards to parking and line ups, but I've never been to a grocery store that doesn't have this problem. The reason this location has now become our regular Superstore is because of how clean it is, the organization makes a lot of sense (for instance, the Mayo is actually near Ketchup, which makes more sense than having it five aisles away), every time we have gone it has been well stocked, and it is really well lit.
