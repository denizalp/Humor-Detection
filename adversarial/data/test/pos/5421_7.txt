This is a fast casual dining kind of place set up like a Subway Sandwich Shop. You either order off a suggested menu or build your own salad and or pizza off the line. Any salad or pizza will only cost you $7.75 before tax drinks and tip.\n\nI liked the salad much more than the pizza from here and would have given a low four stars just for the salad. We shared the steak and blue salad off the menu. The beef in the salad was like a lean medium rare kind of roast beef about a hundred times better than the beef like product you get from a Subway Chain place. The salad was very fresh but I thought the cold beef and cold caramelized onions were odd in this salad. I thought this salad lacked blue cheese BUT if I come back I can build it any way I want and will do better.\n\nI didn't care for the pizza. Respectfully I wasn't a fan of the crust, sauce or the cheese.\nThis crust was very thin and almost cracker like and wasn't like pizza crust to me.\nThe sauce was seasoned very heavy with too much oregano and was overpowering as I wasn't able to taste the fresh basil on the pie.  (maybe an off batch?) The cheese is OK but it isn't the best.\n\nI would come back and have a salad and if I tried a pie again I'd build it like an appetizer bread and enjoy it more.\n\nThree stars is POSITIVE and honest.\n\nThese pizzas are fun but not up there with the best.
