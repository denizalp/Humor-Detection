Apparently I'm in the minority, but I was underwhelmed by El Cachi. Let me preface this by saying I was a huge fan of the previous Mexican restaurant in this hard-to-find spot (El Frescos Cocina Mexicana). For whatever reason, they closed. The menu got tweaked, but prices stayed pretty much the same (read: high) and the new name is very similar. If you aren't looking closely, you might think it's the same business-  but the food isn't as good. \n\nThe shrimp tacos I used to get here regularly were legendary. They were $6 but totally worth it. The new menu specifically calls the new shrimp tacos the \"house favorite\"-- new tacos are a buck less but they don't even compare. The grilled shrimp wasn't seasoned, the mango salsa lacked discernible citrus notes, and the chipotle cream tasted like it was cut with mustard. It's a totally different taco, and I'm bummed about it. \n\nI also tried their carne asada el cachi taco, made with rib eye, and it was okay but the soggy singly-ply corn tortilla tore like half a bite in. How do so many reviews use the word \"authentic\" when they use ONE corn tortilla per taco?! It's gotta be double-thick, y'all. Taco Science 101.  \n\nMy server was friendly, asked for feedback and seemed genuinely interested in how they can improve, which is awesome. I really want to rave about this place but right now their tacos are just A-OK. Is it fair to judge a new business against the standard set by their predecessors? Well, when you offer the exact same cuisine, you're inviting the comparisons. Please make the shrimp tacos great again!
