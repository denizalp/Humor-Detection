I ordered chicken fried rice, bulgogi sliders and soy garlic chicken strips! The fried rice  was all right, just average! The soy garlic chicken strips was way too spicy! It was so spicy that my tongue was on fire! And this is a spicy food lover talking. I couldn't finish it. I will not order from here again.
