I've only been here once but I am planning on coming back for sure! The selection and pricing was extremely good and I really enjoyed the environment. \n\nThey have a large selection of Padron (my favorite) and have lots of seating indoor and outdoor. Out host was very knowledgable and friendly! \n\nGreat spot for business meetings or just hanging with the guys!
