***Warning*** If you have diabetic friends, be sure to AVOID this place.\n\nArz is a supermarket with a huge sugar mountain of baklava and other sweets waiting to tempt you.  They have a selection of strange fruits that I have never seen before, but that wasn't the reason I was here today.\n\nAs Wayne C. mentioned, the display of baklavas is visually appealing and formed into cake tiers.  I ended up walking away with a box of 6 that I chose myself.  For those who are indifferent, they have pre-packaged ones but they came in trays of 20 and 40s and I just couldn't fathom the aftermath if I had bought a tray of these.  Just one \"little\" cube of baklava packs in \"big\" flavour.  If you're having these with coffee, skip the sugar because otherwise you'll fall into a sugar comatose!\n\nParking can be a bit of a problem as their parking lot is a one-way street and spaces are limited.
