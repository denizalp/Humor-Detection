My first impression was, \"We're wandering around Vegas not being able to decide what to eat. Then bam! I just remembered I had my gift card to Palm's so we walk right in.\"\n\nWhen you enter it's typical of a nice steak restaurant with big booths, nicely dressed older crowd, and lots of random photos of celebrities on the walls. What was particular about Palm was that they had tons of caricatures of the celebrities that have visited, and I'm not surprised at the vast diversity of celebs on their list. It is located within Caesar's Palace after all. We are seated into a booth that was a little to squished, yet weirdly comfortable. We ordered the calamari which was good, but nothing too special, however, the portions for the appetizer was big enough to feed 3-4 before the entr√©e. Then, our steak. The rib-eye was delicious, melted in my mouth. We ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly with just enough red in the middle. My boyfriend and I were both sick to our bones, and they were kind enough to keep bringing hot water and lemon to our table. The waiter was friendly and casual, and checked up on us often.\n\nThe lasting impression? \"Great place to get a steak in Vegas.\"
