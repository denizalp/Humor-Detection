One of the better buffets you'll find anywhere, especially for the price.  Free wine and beer. What else do you need to know?\n\nI guess the waiting lines will be the first place to start. I didn't find the wait time to be that bad. But then I don't do lines when they start to snake around.\n\nDinner offers you a wide selection of choices but I prefer breakfast. But focusing on dinner, there's seafood, salads, Oriental, American, Mexican, whatever your food desire is they have a little something for everyone.  Or adventure out of your comfort zone and try a little of everything. Most of the food appears to be prepared fresher than you'll find at other buffets. At some of the stations, the chefs and cooks are preparing edibles right behind the serving counters. And you can keep your beer or wine glass full if you like.\n\nI like the selections for breakfast and it's a good way to start the day. I'm a scrambled eggs guy, which they have, but omelets are made to order.\n\nThe serving line is laid out in the semi circular U-shaped fashion, which makes it easier for people to get to their favorite items. \n\nTables are nicely separated so you don't feel crowded and the place has a nice open air feel to it.\n\nWhen you're done eating your main meal, and you're still gluten for punishment, make sure to check out the desert area because they have a bakery wide selection.
