The Luxury of Lexus.\n\nI stopped in not thinking I was going to leave the old car and drive away with a new one, but I did.  I knew what I was looking for and browsed the lot for a minute.  I noticed that I wasn't bombarded with salesman itching to move a car off the lot.  Over anxious sales tactics at other dealerships is such a turnoff for me.  It's nice to have shopping time especially since I was by myself. \n\nAfter browsing I CHOSE to walk in to speak with someone.  Upon entering their clean bright showroom, they were very polite and friendly during my time spent here.  I test drove and decided to move forward with the process.  My salesman, Paul, was informative and helpful.  We came to a deal and it was smooth sailing after that.  \n\nIt was definitely a different car buying experience for me.  With complimentary car washes for as long as I own the car, I'm sure I'll be in often.
