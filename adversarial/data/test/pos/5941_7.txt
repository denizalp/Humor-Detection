This is one of  my favorites downtown, along with the Golden Nugget.  Main Street Station is a small casino hotel within walking distance of the Fremont Experience.  Though the establishment is small, they offer a good variety of slots and your standard pit games of craps, roulette, three card poker, black jack, etc.  If you do ANY gambling there, get the players club card.  You will receive room and food comps based liberally on your play.  Once you walk inside the casino, is a cozy, welcoming decor furnished with a lot of fine antiques and elaborate wood work.\n\nThe standard rooms are clean and well-furnished!  I personally think they are as nice as Golden Nugget's standard rooms.  And I think that tells you something, since the Nugget boasts to be the best casino hotel downtown.\n\nThough we've only eaten at the buffet, we've frequented it numerous times; several times for breakfast, brunch, and once for dinner.  The breakfasts and brunches are excellent!  There are (on weekends) eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, made to order omelets (made w\/REAL eggs cracked right in front of you), ham, bacon, sausage, corned beef hash, breakfast casserole, sausage gravy, biscuits, fruits, grits, oatmeal, pastries, pasta salads, kalua pork (not good here), mexican breakfast selections, asian (breakfast?), and of course a variety of drinks your server will bring you.\n\nThe night we went for the dinner buffet was a Thursday.  I think Thursdays are still their filet and shrimp scampi nights?  The filet was good and tasty but not great.  Good enough to get seconds though.  The scampi I was told was good.  The dinner buffets have as big of a selection as the breakfast buffets do, so there will DEFINITELY be something for even the pickiest of eaters to certainly ENJOY.  \n\nTo make a long story short, THIS IS A VERY GOOD BUFFET for the modest prices.  Main Street certainly is one of my favorites in all of Vegas.
