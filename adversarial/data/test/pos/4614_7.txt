A decent Square One food court stall, and something new to try when you find yourself lost in a sea of options in this ever-expanding food court. The service here is fantastic. Very informative, friendly, professional. And they're more than happy to have you sample certain dishes when you aren't sure what to order. However, overall, I think the quality of the meals is a bit lacking, and there's certainly room for improvement. But, the friendly service and wide variety of menu items were definitely positives for me, and I'll definitely be back to try something else.\n\nFirst, the menu. There's a large variety of items to choose from. They offer various sandwiches, pho, various egg noodle soups and udon noodle soups, and different types of rice platters. Mii Sandwich also works in conjunction with The Sweet Spot, which serves Bubble Teas, Lemonades, Slush Drinks, Asian \"Halo Halo\" desserts, Milkshakes, and Real Fruit Smoothes. So overall, you definitely have options!\n\nSecond, the food. I ordered the Korean Bulgogi Beef Rice Platter ($8.49) and a Real Fruit Mango Smoothie with mango chunks. While the food was tasty with decent flavourf, I actually found the meat itself to be very tough to chew and not the best quality cut. It wasn't very tender and took away from the flavour of the dish. The real fruit smoothie was alright, and I wouldn't mind trying out their other flavours the next time I'm in the area.\n\nFor everything, I paid around $15.00. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying out other dishes, but there's certainly room for improvement in terms of quality and execution. However, not a deal breaker, and I'll be back again!
