Going to this place seems to always be followed with a \"Never again am I drinking that much again.\" And yet I return, and get just that drunk not that far into the future. It is what it is, and there are definitely better options. That said though, there are worse places, and it has its charms (though I feel that \"charm\" is not the right word).
