We started off our family fun vacation by purchasing two 60oz Fat Tuesday slushy drinks (extra shots included!). We then galavanted down to the crystal blue palazzo pool and cannonballed into the pool! Oh what a joy we had as a family!!!!! The kids just enjoyed themselves! We may have had a minor bathroom mistake in the pool, but the staff was so attentive and kicked us out!!! My husband Jeff's favorite part of our suite was the not one, not two, but THREE TV's so he could watch football, golf, and modern family!!! We finished the trip with a BANG and hit up the family fun chippendales show! 5 stars for Vegas, and 5 stars for the palazzo, our family will be back!!
