Scammed! My husband was working so I handled the rat issues at our home that was for sale! Dave meet me at the property put up two traps & charged me $170.00 that was on top of the yelp deal! Not only did we not have rats but he hasn't returned my calls or my husbands & we have his traps hoping he'll call, knowing he scammed us! $170.00 for 15 min? No return visit no nothing.... Be warned!!!!!!
