Du-par's is totally legit!! My boyfriend brought me here absolutely raving about how good the pancakes were. I personally am not a \"sweets\" in the morning person; I'm more of a salty loving, sourdough toast and eggs fan. That said, the pancakes are like CRACK!! I have no idea how they get that buttery crust on them, and I had zero intentions of eating pancakes, but my boyfriend ended up having to forfeit his pancake meal for my mushroom and swiss omelette.\n\nThe omelette was great... but those pancakes... smh... if I lived near a Du-pars I'd be 600lbs!! \n\nThe service was great, the prices were in line with that of Denny's, Barney's, or Coco's-- very affordable and worth every single penny! \n\nI'll be checking in here again-- tomorrow!!
