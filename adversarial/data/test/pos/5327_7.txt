This is by far the saddest institute of higher learning I have ever stepped foot in.  From the outdated interior, to the quiet music and depressed students and staff, this is not a place I would ever work at no matter how high the salary. I went in for an interview on Friday and have never felt more defeated, disrespected, and insulted by a potential employer in my life.  I was told on the phone to be there at \"10:00 or so\" and to take my time.  I arrived a few minutes after 10:00 with my model who just worked a 14 hour overnight shift in the E.R.   I was scolded by Shirley for running behind and rushed to get started.  That should have been my que to leave.  However, I proceeded with my haircut and blowdry demonstration.  Throughout the service my model noticed several glares and eye rolls from Shirley, as she watched at a close distance. \n\n Following my demo,  I was brought into an office by Shirley and Linda.  I was asked to take a seat and they gave me a small notebook to \"take notes\".  They thanked me for coming in then immediately began to tell my everything I did terribly.  I was told my cut was boring and unimpressive and I should have done an \"edgy bob\" despite my client asking for a conservative one length cut for her upcoming wedding,  my class was \"so boring students got up and walked away\" (the only student who took off was due to lunch and apologized- every single student thanked and complimented me at the end), I am not qualified to be an instructor and need to go back behind the chair to finesse my skillset and learn how to do hair, and I don't have enough experience in general.  They even listed everyone who worked there and the years of experience and credentials they had compared to mine.  Apparently I am also disgusting for holding the blow dryer between my elbow and torso when I paused to answer a question from a student and told I \"shoved it up my armpit\".  Several other insults continued for about 25 minutes until they told me I was not hired. My biggest regret was that I didn't walk out right away.  I however felt backed into a corner, as the two of them were sitting by the exit.\n\n  I am so disgusted and appalled by the level of disrespect I received from these ladies.  They are not exemplary representations of the Paul Mitchell culture and I am horrified that students pay several thousands of dollars to receive an education  at this school.  I am more than qualified to instruct at any school as I have years of experience behind the chair, have received hands on training from celebrity stylists and colorists, have trained and certified in the world renowned Vidal Sassoon principles of cutting, taken more classes than I can count, and came with a glowing letter of recommendation from the Paul Mitchell** school I previously taught at. \n\nIf you are considering pursuing a career in cosmetology, I urge you to please explore your other options.  There are several other prestigious institutes in the Phoenix metropolitan area where I'm sure you will be treated more fairly and have a positive, uplifting, and inspiring experience.
