I feel like I was made for this place, like bring in a tall blonde girl with sexy friends ... ta da... here is a fabulous playground to frolic around in the sun, and drink the day away. \n\nThis place puts me in a good mood the moment I walk up the stairs, I just smile for a second and think about how good it feels being young and in love with life. Happiness can radiate such amazing confidence. Thumping music, golden reflections off Mandalay Bay. So sweet, man.\n\nI've been here with a day bed, opium bed, pavilion aka cabana and with nothing but my credit card in my swimsuit top. All ways are fun! \n\nJust get your ass here to party, day parties are what's up. You just have to do it right. Pretty please boys don't over do it with the booze, nothing is more unattractive than the waste case than becomes socially retarded slurring and grunting. Keep things chill rotating every other drink with water. Drink of choice for me is definitely a margarita or champagne only. So I can get buzzy and stay hydrated. it's hot under that strong Las Vegas sun, we're in the desert damn it.\n\nMoorea's not a huge place but I like that, I can come and conquer knowing there was nothing I missed. Maybe I'm a little selfish for the spotlight or seeing funny shit happen with drunk people. :)\n\nCute girls: Ask for Tyler, he is the \"scout\" who has a certain number of free girls he can get in for the day. So get in your girl packs and remember it's a topless pool. \n\nLet loose it's summer, maybe you'll catch me in some pasties at the pool ;p
