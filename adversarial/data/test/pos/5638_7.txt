Came here for an early lunch. I was hungry cause I did not eat breakfast. \n\nAs we entered, it is a small restaurant with about 8 tables. There was dark tint on their windows. The nice waitress welcomed us inside. \nThey have lunch specials from 11 am to 3 pm which include an egg drop soup with a main entree, Lo mein, and your choice of rice. Not bad. We all had cold waters to drink. \n\nI ordered the Mongolian beef with fried rice and came with noodles. The noodles were really good. Soft and flavored with soy sauce. I was a little disappointed in the Mongolian beef. It was good but they gave me more onions than meat. A little stingy on the meat. The fried rice was good. The best Chinese food I have tasted so far here. \n\nService was great by our waitress. She was telling us it is a family owned business. She was talking to my daughter and made her feel better. Waitress  gave my daughter an egg drop soup on the house because she wasn't feeling good. She even massaged my daughter's head. Wow! Super nice! \nI definitely will return here if we are in the neighborhood. Good Chinese food!
