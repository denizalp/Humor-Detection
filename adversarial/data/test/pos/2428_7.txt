The Wynn is a LOSE.\n\nIf you're considering staying here, read the negative reviews on Yelp. I wish I had. This hotel has everything: middle-of-the-night theft where the guest is blamed for leaving the door unlocked, kicking guest out bc of baby crying, kicking guest out for being Muslim, broken glass, funny room charges, more theft... all that in a three-month period. \n\nWe stayed about a week bc the bf's company put us up for a conference. Here's why you should stay elsewhere:\n\nThe Wynn has a policy that says THEY CAN ENTER YOUR ROOM WITHOUT CALLING IF YOU HAVE YOUR DO-NOT-DISTURB LIGHT ON FOR LONGER THAN 24 HOURS. They don't tell you this on the forms you sign or at check-in. One evening, the bf and I were chilling before hitting the Strip. We were both mostly naked in bed when we heard a knock and a keycard sliding in. Bf lept up wearing nothing but drawers and a manager walked right in without announcing himself and got a good look. Bf yelled, \"Jesus, let me get some f*cking pants on!\", pulled on some sweats, and talked to the manager, who said he was doing a wellness check. I'm glad we weren't kertanging or getting into \/ out of the shower. \n\nThis really rattled my bf and he asked the front desk if he could speak with a manager. Someone called back later that night and when my bf in his distress mentioned checking with his company's legal department about his rights, he clammed up right away and told him everything else would have to go through a lawyer.\n\nThe next day, we talked to a second manager, who met us in person. This dude listened to both of our grievances and then gave a bunch of lip service about how they don't call before going up because you never know what people might say. Ok, just so you know, THE WYNN SEES YOU AS A POTENTIAL CRIMINAL. And he talked proudly about how the Wynn is one of the few hotels in the world with the 24-hr policy (duh, bc it's unreasonable) and how Steve Wynn only wants the best of everything. He focused the rest of his attention on the way back on my bf (ignored me completely), distracting him w small talk to de-escalate the situation. We weren't offered any compensation and when we phoned later to set up a wakeup call, they informed us that they were recording our calls.\n\nThis hotel killed the vibe of our Vegas trip. The management was so unhelpful we asked the front desk of the Palazzo (our preferred hotel) for advice on how to deal with the situation (they told us their policy is three days minimum to check on a room but they also call up first). \n\nHere's what \"Steve Wynn's best\" gets you:\n\n- INTERNET IS THROTTLED. You pay per device per day and the Wynn goes one step further and charges for different speed tiers. For the same fee at other properties on the Strip, you get multiple devices and high-speed internet. THE WYNN PRICE-GOUGES to screw their customers out of more money. \n\n- WALLS ARE EGGSHELL-THIN. When the person across the hall uses their key card, it sounds like they're coming into your room. I could hear my neighbors fighting, loud and clear. The rooms themselves are small for what you pay. The Wynn is a gilded turd - they cut corners on quality construction and tried to mask it with a paint job and high fees. \n\n- Other properties do it bigger and better, which is why no one stays here. The casino is small and empty. One of the nice things about staying on the Strip is being able to walk downstairs and grab a bite or see a show, gamble, drink, and take the elevator upstairs. We didn't see anyone doing this at the Wynn. \n\n- IT'S WHERE THE ACTION ISN'T. It's located on the north side of the Strip, away from the fun stuff and good food. You will be walking south the entire time anyway. Several reviewers mention the Wynn's proximity to The Venetian\/Palazzo as a selling point; bruh, just stay at the Venetian\/Palazzo. It takes forever to get to the Wynn rooms from the Strip entrance.\n\n- MANAGEMENT BLOWS. This hotel is run by people who have no business being in hospitality. Unhelpful and hostile towards guests. \n\n- This is hardcore geared towards Chinese clients with money so they have CCTV and bilingual magazines. It sickens me to think about folks coming from overseas only to have some dumb manager burst in on them in their underwear and then to get bullshitted by management about it. That shit doesn't happen in China, either. \n\nYou get more bang for your buck at other hotels on the Strip and if you're gonna pay to get abused, there are some very fine professionals in Vegas that can show you a better time than the Wynn does.
