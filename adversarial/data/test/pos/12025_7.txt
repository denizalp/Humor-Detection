Super shady side of Las Vegas, If you are going to be coming here at night make sure you either take a guy with you, or a huge group. And dont keep anything in your back pockets either! With that being said, i have always wanted to come here and check it out! Maybe i was drawn to the light show or maybe because this is old Las Vegas from back in the day before the pricey glitz and glamour that took over just a ways away!!\nWalking around Fremont street kind of feels like Hollywood late at night. You got all your celebrity characters (Batman, Spiderman, Rod Stewart, Prince, Bret Michaels, a dude wearing a sparkly bikini and many more which totally freak me out). Then you had not one but three stages of various 80's cover bands playing yesterday's favorite jams, which was totally cool to stand back and watch along with all the fine people of Fremont street that came by for a drink and to drunk dance!! Then you got your crazy street acts (reminds me of Santa Monica during the warm summer nights).\nThe light show was pretty cool along with watching people ziplining. Eepies its pretty high up there too!!\nPlenty of places to get your eating,drinking,shopping,or strip club on!! Glad that i got to experience this, i dont think i'll be coming back for a second visit!!
