If you are a tourist from a land with few Mexican options and you can't travel far from the Strip... well, I was going to say you should come here just so you can experience a salsa bar, but you know what? Better you should go somewhere else and actually have quality food. \n\nThe salsa bar here is shabbily presented, outright messy (congealed spills everywhere, including on the few tiny cups available, and this was in a dead restaurant at 4:00 p.m.), somewhat limited in selection compared to other places, clearly old (the cilantro leaves looked like they died in the sun two days ago), not very finessed in flavor, and - depressingly - the bar has a *permanent* sign for one salsa that reads \"AVACADO.\"\n\nThe vegetarian options go from \"standard yawn\" (cheese enchiladas, bean burrito, quesadilla, chile relleno, veg fajitas) to \"abysmal\" when you realize that the cheese of choice here is cheddar. This is a town where almost every grocery store carries Oaxaca, Panela, Cotija, etc., and Gardunos is using not just cheddar, but that Oompa Loompa orange cheddar that, when hot, takes on an oily sheen that slides right off the cheese with a little poking.\n\nI had to specifically ask for the sopapillas that were supposed to come with my plate; complimentary sopapillas during the meal are a touch that sets Gardunos apart and something I enjoyed when I tried their Fiesta Rancho location several years ago. Alas, on this occasion the sopapillas were very thick, chewy, and dry, not the soft, puffy pillows that this veteran sopapillas nommer expects.\n\nMissing sopapillas aside, the service was great. Everyone was friendly and refills were brisk. Of course, I'd expect no less when only three parties are dining, but if the servers have the same helpful, cheerful attitude when the house is full, then that's one thing Gardunos is doing right.\n\nLocals have absolutely no excuse for eating here. \n\nTourists, now you know better. The Strip has several better options for what I consider to be the three zones of Mex cuisine: street-style interpretations of \"authentic,\" familiar standards good for newbies and old-hands alike, and Michelin-bound inventiveness. \n\n(But don't be lazy and go to the wholly unremarkable La Salsa, which has surely earned its stars on visitors who think it's okay to go to Taco Bell when you're sober.)\n\nYou're in Las Vegas. Raise your \"Mexpectations.\" We can make you *much* happier than this.
