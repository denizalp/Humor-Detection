What is it with this place?  Since moving to the valley over 18 months ago my daughters have been enamored with this place.  Actually it is starting to wane, thank God.\n\nHow are these things all over the place?  Can't we make them get back to the mall food courts where they belong?  They are the McDonald's of Chinese food aren't they?  When I lived back east we didn't let these McChinese places get out of hand.  \n\nValley residents have obviously not put them in their place in the scheme of things.\n\nBad Chinese food fast!
