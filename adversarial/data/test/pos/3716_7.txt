It honestly makes me hate my face right now I don't even want to walk outside. The areas I got hair removed now have zits all over them. I work so hard to keep my face clean and than all of the sudden this happens I hate this place now. To add on top of that the workers just seen so unhappy they don't laugh at all or say anything.
