First time at this salon & it was a major disappointment. I got the worst gel manicure ever. Seriously not worth the $50. I have gotten more pampered on a $10 manicure then what I experienced here at dolce. This so called \"spa manicure\" involves a second of nail filing then quickly applying the gel all sloppy with bubbles I might add & then you get to choose between a lotion or a hand scrub to totally apply yourself. Awesome.. What a pampering experience. Never going there again.
