The Little Monday Café is a small location of great small bites and delicious coffee.\n\nBeing located just off of Bow Trail in Spruce Cliff, the Little Monday Café is a little out of the way for most people. For the locals however, it's a popular place to drop by for a coffee and some friendly conversation. The Café owner will delight you with her delicious pastries cooked in house or a selection of frozen gluten free items. The Café offers various sandwiches and breakfast\/lunch items but the real reason to go is the coffee. They have a delicious coffee roaster who roasts their coffee for them in Calgary (I believe). The atmosphere is far friendlier than your average coffee shop with fast service. Be sure to get there on an off hour if you want to get a table though, as there is not much for seating.\n\nThis Little Café is definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.
