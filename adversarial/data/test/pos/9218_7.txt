I've been here twice and have to say that both times have been horrible! Both times the food has been a huge disappointment. Taste is very processed and unappealing. The drinks are bland and the bartenders have horrible attitudes. One acted as though it was the end of the world when i ordered a mojito for my girlfriend because he'd actually have to mix a drink. As far as ambiance, the owners tried to do a very chic and impressive interior, but it looks cheap and unfinished. To anyone who has a taste of style, this place is pathetic.  The last time we went was for a charity event which was $50 a head. It was fairly empty outside and we were sitting with another couple. The waitress asked us to move to a different table as the owners wanted to sit there. Four douches in affliction shirts sat down and I'm pretty sure the only reason they asked us to move was to impress the girls they were with. I am positive that all the good reviews on here were written by them. EVERY LOCAL I KNOW HATES THIS PLACE!! No chance this place lasts through the winter...
