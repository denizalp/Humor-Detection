The worse company I have EVER had to deal with! Basically I was lied to after repeatedly asking the same question a two-year service agreement is supposed to lock you in with no extra charges before the end of that term... No! Basically you will have to pay if you terminate your agreement before then BUT they are allowed to continually add on more to your bill each month because as I was told \" I'm so sorry they didn't explain that to you but you still have to pay it\". Thank you for showing me once AGAIN why I left cox in the first place!! I'd rather pay for antenna TV. And I'm glad I only have 12 more months to have to deal with this rotten company!! Cox you sucks!!
