Toast is a cute brunch place with so much potential. I would loved to have had the opportunity to rate the food; however, the service was so bad that we didn't even make it to our seats. Walking to the restaurant, we were a little discouraged to see so many people outside waiting for tables but were pleasantly surprised to hear it would be just a few minutes for a table for two - first available (inside or outside). However, after 30 minutes of watching party after party be seated before us after arriving after us, we inquired why people were being seated ahead of us. After being told they were parties of 2 and were open to first available seating, I explained that we were as well. Granted, we were hungry. But it wasn't the wait that bothered me the most. It is Sunday brunch after all. What bothered me most was the complete and utter lack of awareness; there was absolutely no attention to detail, no system in place to seat people! At a restaurant! There were 4 open tables plus a two seats at the bar, not to mention who knows how many seats in the back patio. And two of them were acting as hostesses. Too bad neither of them could figure out how to get butts in chairs. And I was so looking forward to the gluten free pancakes. I would rate zero stars but there wasn't an option for that.
