I'm a fan of this local supplement chain- their stores tend to be well stocked and their employees are usually helpful. This location is fairly new and hasn't been particularly busy when I go by. The clearance section in the back right usually has a couple cool things. Be on the lookout for grand opening discounts and coupons (like $10 vouchers!), and don't forget your samples when you check out!
