This is my absolute favorite restaurant to blow bucks on in Las Vegas.  The beef is just so damn awesome!  Sure, I could save Carnevino for special occasions, but honestly, it's too good for that.  Eating here is special enough and any excuse whatsoever is sufficient.  Finished season 3 of \"Suits\" in one day?  Did 4 minutes and 9 seconds straight on the treadmill??  Managed to put my pants on all by myself one leg at a time????  Carne-fucking-vino!!!!!!!!\n\nWhile there are many stupendous starters to choose from, like their grilled octopus, Prosciutto di Parma 'Riserva', or steak tartare for back to back beefiness, it's the Ricotta and Egg Raviolo that screams out to me on every visit.  At $21, it may very well be the priciest single ravioli in the city, but take one bite and try to deny that it is freakin incredible.  Sop up the leftover brown butter and yolk for additional amazingness!!  I hate myself when I order it and love myself after I finish it.  \n\nThe stars aligned on my most recent visit when the server informed us that their 9 month aged riserva beef was available, so we pounced on a 1 inch thick cut for $115.  All those rumors of the flavors were true, the hints of blue cheese and gorgonzola, the muscle-y fibrous chew and distinct beef flavor were like nothing I'd ever had before.  Kiss the tip of the fork in some of the aged balsamic before sticking it in and you've got foodgasm galore.  \n\nThis was an exceptional tasting experience that any beef connoisseur should seek out as this is the only steakhouse in the US that ages beef this long.  They actually advised us to finish our ribeye (of course we got one of those too) first, but we simply couldn't wait that long and enjoyed the differences between the two immensely.   \n\nBest way to lessen the hit on the wallet would probably be racking up the Opentable points.  We knocked off $200 between that and a gift card.\n\nRegardless of the fact that dinner will be pricier than the tires on your car, I love this place through and through.  Lift that steak bone up like the Olympic torch and rejoice in all that was devoured.
