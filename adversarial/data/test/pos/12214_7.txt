This was our 7 year wedding anniversary and we had  very high hopes of having a wonderful time. The grounds themselves are gorgeous, and the hotel is kept up very well.\n\nThe problem lied in the staff. When we came back from breakfast, our room was being cleaned with the French doors propped open by the housekeeper's cleaning cart. There is a specific sign that says to please not leave the doors open because bugs get in, and indeed they did as we had both dead and live bugs including a baby lizard!\n\nWhile at the pool, my husband went up to ask for our tab as we wanted to leave, and the server was apparently having a terrible day. He lit up my husband about what a terribly run place this bar is, and how they were out of everything, computers down, & a litany of profanity in expressing his dismay at having to work there! We could not believe this, and were taken aback.\n\nWe asked that are covers be turned down on our final evening there, as there were yellow stains on the comforter. While it seems that the sheets were changed, the same yellow stains were on the comforter after they cleaned the room.\n\nThere were other issues, I won't bore you with the details, we did make the front desk aware of the entire list and she did deduct $75 off of our stay of 3 nights, but that didn't make up for the ridiculous charges and abuse we endured while being there. The parking charge of $15 per day is also absurd, especially since we took other means of transportation everywhere we went during our stay.\n\nWhile the grounds are beautiful, I would appreciate going to a place that is was not as unprofessional as they were here, including some snide remarks made by the valets, in an attempt to be funny. \n\nI fully expected management to call me the next day after my list of gripes, however our business was apparently not important enough for them to do so. I also suspect that the front desk person did not even convey these to management, which we did ask to speak to before we left, but were told she was not in.\n\nThere are plenty of other gorgeous resorts in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale who will receive our business in the future.
