I love love love Bertha's! This cozy, family-owned spot is one that you surely do not want to pass up. Whether you're in the mood for breakfast or lunch, they literally have something for everyone. I LOVE their breakfast sandwiches. My favorite being their Turkey Jalapeno Egg Sandwich. It has 2 eggs, Havarti cheese, avocado, tomato, and jalapeno mayo but you really can't go wrong with any of them. They also do an amazing job with breakfast catering if you need! \n\nThey truly have some of the best salads around - they're packed with all kind of goodies and definitely won't leave you hungry. Finish off your meal with one of their delicious baked goods like a mini cupcake or cheesecake. \n\nI'll be back soon, Bertha's! I'm so grateful that you're in the neighborhood.
