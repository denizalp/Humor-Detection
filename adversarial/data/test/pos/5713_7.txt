Night-time hunger kicked in for hubby. He was craving sushi and we both wanted to get out of our crappy hotel room. Luckily, this place has a happy hour at 9p and it was just down the street! \n\nI enjoyed the avocado Roll (not on the hh menu, but still a decent price) and the chicken skewers. I also got a free order of egg rolls after tagging them in an Instagram post. But our favorite of the evening was definitely the Las Vegas Roll because it was deep fried. Major win. \n\nThe only disappointment was the sushi burrito. It's just better to get one at at a place that specializes in them and let's you load them up with all the awesome stuff you want. \n\nService was fine. We would definitely hit this place up next time we're in town.
