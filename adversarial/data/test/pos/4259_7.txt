The place is cool looking and the 10$ piercings are really cool, but the customer service was just terrible! Didn't get greeted by ANYONE there. How do you expect to get clients or have people referred there when the simplest of simple \"hello, how are you\" can't even be done! I was already a nervous wreck about my piercing & the workers definitely didn't make me feel comfortable. I won't be recommending anyone to this location.
