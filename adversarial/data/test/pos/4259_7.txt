Since we were staying at the Mirage - and we wanted some breakfast -but not feeling hungry enough for the buffet - yet, wanted more than a muffin and a coffee at Starbucks - we chose BB Kings mainly because it was close by and no wait.\n\nI was excited to see the chicken and waffles - I've always wanted to try chicken and waffles.   It wasn't anything as spectacular as you hear so many people rave about how great it was.    The chicken looked like chicken tenders you could get at a fast food joint -for this I paid $15?\n\nNow mind you, if it were good - I wouldn't be complaining.\n\nMy husband had a yogurt parfait - that was a small cup of yogurt and a handful of granola for $10.  HUH?   Ok, people, I realize I'm in Vegas but come on - give me a little more here... don't make it SO obvious you are RIPPING me off...  it hurts when you do that!  LOL!\n\nThere are so many other options to eat at in Viva Las Vegas- so really, skip this one...
