I have had some very scary experiences there.\nI went to the ER because I had gall bladder attack.  ER was great and took me out of the waiting room wreathing in pain, and put me right in an examination room.  From there a nurse would come in every couple of hours and take my blood pressure, the cuff was too small and too old and kept popping undone.  She could have cared less.  God knows what she was recording for my blood pressure.  I'm sure she made something up because it was impossible to take a reading.\n\nI was finally taken for a CT scan and the technician was kind enough to tell me my gall bladder would have to come out.  He stayed late on his shift to give me the scan.  The porter wheeled me back to ER with the scan on my bed.  Long story short they lost my CT.  It ended up being at the nurses station the whole time in ER.  They were using it as a coaster for their coffee or something, because not one of them picked it up to read it, show it to a Dr. just left it and me in excruciating pain waiting.  They did keep coming in to take an inaccurate blood pressure reading and remind me I could not have anything for pain.  I was ready to remove my gall bladder myself...... I begged my husband the following evening (still waiting in ER) to go back gave him a description of the CT technician and  find him and find my CT.  Sure enough, the guy had gone home and was back at work for his next for shift.  He ran down with my husband, not believing how incompetent the nurses were to find in on the counter of the nurses station.\n\nThe Dr.(Forest) that finally preformed the surgery was wonderful.  The Anesthesiologist was a clown.  The last thing I remember of him was him telling me that there was a chance I would not make it through surgery.  Perhaps he was the molester guy they had there.  His English was not very good.\n\nI have several other stories to share of North York.\n\nAll in all there are some great Doctors there.  If you have a friend, child or relative staying in the hospital make sure someone is with them at all times.  Nursing staff is brutal.  1 in 10 are good and like their jobs.  If you are waiting for someone to come out of post-op chances are their name will drop off the screen, the system will go down, or nobody will care to look for a loved one waiting and wheel the person right by you and up to a room.  Keep your heads up.  My dogs Vet clinic is run better!!
