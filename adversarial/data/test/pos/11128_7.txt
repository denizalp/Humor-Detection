This is the worst, crappy \"Mexican\" food I've ever had.  First of all,  they had no drink menus.  Said they were \"working\" on them.  So I ordered a Cuervo 1800 Margarita with a grand mariner float.  They put it in a mix.  In a mix.  And it wasn't cheap.  Secondly, we got chips, salsa,  and bean dip. Chips are super salty and the rest was just ok. After waiting so long to order, we had eaten a whole bowl of chips.  I ordered chicken fajitas.  I hate onions so I asked for avacado and was told \"we don't sell avacados.  Only guacamole. \"So I got the guacamole. Again,  a huge wait for food.  The fajitas did not have green pepper.  Instead,  they had jalape√±o which one would think this would give it flavor but instead tasted like something you'd get at Applebee's.  The beans were mushy and the rice tasteless. Oh yeah,  and no patio seating.  A total disappointment and we will never,  ever be back.  There are dozens of Mexican restaurants, including a very good one across the street.  Don't bother with Serranos.
