Bought their most expensive package - \"full royalty detailing\". Utter disappointment and a complete waste of money.\n\n- Carpet was not shampooed -  coffee spill (primary reason for visit) was barely touched\n- Windshield\/windows were not even wiped at all from the inside\n- They did not clean under the cupholder rubber insert, tons of visible dirt was left behind. \n- They did not properly clean trunk upholstery, lots of dirt\/dust left behind.\n- The leather seats were not cleaned -at all-\n\nBasically you're paying 200 bucks for some kid to do a bad job vacuuming your car and wiping the dash.  Find a better detailer - AVOID THIS PLACE!
