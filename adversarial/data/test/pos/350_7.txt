I had an interesting experience here.\n\nI went to buy a suit.  Luckily, BCFW had a red tag sale going on and I found an awesome Charcoal Kenneth Cole two piece.  I was in a good mood because I figured, \"Heck, I'll land that job with this, no problem.\"\n\nAs I was leaving the dressing room, a guy from the suit section and from the Big and Tall section were having an epic battle of words about 4 feet away from me.  I was rather interested, so I stood there and observed.  I couldn't hear what it was about but the suit guy said \"shut up you #####\" and the big guy said \"don't walk away ####.\"\n\nNow, I'm a 25 year old dude, so I used language like this alot, but never in a setting like this.  Luckily, there were no kids around but I'm pretty sure thats the kinda thing parents would want to avoid.\n\nI have returned a few times after this incident and the suit guy remains an employee there while the big guy has moved on.
