5 years, I've been hittin this Starbucks. Five years.\n\nIt has a drive thru- and I get my coffee made the way I like it every time. Going into this store for a drink is fine, but the drive thru moves faster. All the employees are nice and smiley.\n\nIt's got plenty of seating, a gigantic patio and even misters. Typically full of work-from-laptop peeps and students and not any loungey type seats except for a few leatherette chairs near the pick up window. The wi-fi always works great for me on the old iPhone. \n\nIt's located on a mondo-busy corner, so you might not be cool with making a left turn onto 16th St. out of the parking lot unless you're over-insured. The jay-walking pedestrians and volume of traffic would be difficult to avoid running into.\n\n*Pro tip- avoid between 2:45-4pm unless you want to wait in line behind 50 high school kids, and that's down from 100 kids since Dutch Bros opened nearby.
