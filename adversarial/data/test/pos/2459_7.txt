So finally got to meet our new CM Jenn. It been lot of years in Vegas for me and going through different CM. One thing love and enjoy each one has brought their own style to Vegas Yelp. Jenn being from Vegas feel brings different perspective to our Yelp Community. It only my first event with Jenn but love her ideas and her passion to support local business. Huge shout out to Jenn for setting up wonderful event! Jenn is someone you just fall in love with from the minute you meet her. She always smiling, positive vibes, friendly, caring, and embraces all the things love about being yelper. \n\nJenn was checking people in and handing out raffle tickets for free concert tickets. So for this even we had the pirate room reserved. It located in the back of the Golden Tiki. The best part about being nice small little area that you were able to walk around talk with other yelpers. Lately I have not had much luck getting in events. So it was refreshing in ways only seen Eric S that meet other events and rest were new yelpers got to meet. John and Patrick cool yelpers. I hanging out talking stories with them. Later as the night winding down jumped on another table meet more yelpers. We got complimentary drink of cocktail they made for the event. Also had nice little spread of bar food for us sample over our drinks. I was one of the lucky ones that scored some concert tickets. Again huge Mahalos to Jenn not only setting up amazing event but giving out free concert tickets!!! \n\nThe staff at Golden Tiki THANK YOU for hosting Yelp community. The minute I walked in the hostess was great asking if here for Yelp event. I got directed to the back towards the pirate room. It was my first time at The Golden Tiki so made this event even more fun! The place has personality like BIG time. Awesome one! Second major shout out to Nicole for taking care of use the whole night. She was the only cocktail server working the whole room. She did amazing job! Not only staying on top of it. Nicole just rockstar!!! Honest most of the times gone to Yelp events the staff even if personality not very personable. Nicole she so SO SO much fun talking stories about anything, personality, always smiling, friendly, and made great recommendations for drinks. My second drink wanted to get something off the menu. She recommended the dole whip with alcohol. Winnah!!! Thank you Nicole. She really master comes to making it and making that perfect dole whip swirl. Nicole made the night that much more fun!!! When I do go back definitely plan on seeing Nicole make me another Dole Whip and more recommendations on drinks.
