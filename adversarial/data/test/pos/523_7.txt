Brian K is obviously an employee that doesn't realize that we can spot trolls on these reviews. Integra might be good if you have one line at your tire shop. GOD help you if you have anything more. BTW, they don't understand that T.37 transmission stuff, so good luck with your credit card and fax transmissions.\n\nYELP really does need a zero rating. By the way, I own a telecom vendor company, so this really is gospel.
