I'm more of a FATS guy myself, but I love this concept. One side of menu is 'healthy' while the other is 'happy' (aka a lot less healthy aka all my favorites). Seems a touch gimmicky at first, but it's well done. All the food is high quality, and the service is excellent.\n\nThe lady and I shared a Steak Eyes 2.0 (happy) and Protein Waffles (healthy) and it was perfect. We got to indulge without feeling like total garbage afterwards. But dude those Steak Eyes were amazing. Country Fried Steak on Jalape√±o Cornbread with Two Eggs & Gravy on top. OOOHH BOYYY!!!\n\nMy buddy got the S'motherload, which is basically a Breakfast Burrito the size of a boot and covered in a delicious Cajun Queso sauce. \n\nFive fat stars.
