I was looking for some good breakfast places around Gilbert and found this one with good reviews. \n\nThe place was popping at 8:30am but we were seated immediately. People who came after had to wait a little longer for the tables to clear. We sat on the benches at the patio and the weather was pretty good too. \n\nWe ordered orange juice, veggie omelet, veggie skillet and crunchy French toast. The service was pretty quick and the food presentation was good. The French toast was crunchy but was basic for me. It wasn't any special, so was the omelet and the skillet. The good part was the potatoes served with these omelet and skillet which was delicious. Well done and few crunchy. The rest was as usual. \n\nThe price is definitely above average, breakfast for three was about $45. The place is good but I didn't see anything great to return back.
