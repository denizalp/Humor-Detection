I'm sitting at 3.5 stars at the moment simply cause the 2.5 hour cooking class was definitely a lot of fun and worth the experience, but I don't think I'd go for it again. I was hoping to pick up a few tips and tricks on cooking and to have a more hands-on cooking experience but there were just too many students and for some students, it ended up being being a lot of standing around.\n\nWe got a quick introduction at the beginning of our class, of course with some drinks to loosen things up, and we moved over to the kitchen. In the kitchen, each part of our meal had its own work station and we were told to choose a station we would like to work at. So with there being 20 people in our class, and 5 work stations, things got a little crowded especially at the dessert and steak work stations (understandably so), but not so much at the crustini, street corn, or chimichurri sections.\n\nChef Joe was a wonderful teacher, making the class a lot of fun, even throwing in some fun facts (the sulphur in onions is what makes you cry) and tips on how to replicate the dishes we made at home, but at least one of his helpers came across more as just a waiter following Chef Joe's direct instruction, much like the rest of us students. I was hoping that his helpers would be able to give us tips and tricks on cooking since Chef Joe was doing a lot running around, but unfortunately the helper assigned to our station didn't seem to know any more than we did.\n\nThat aside, if you're looking to have a nice meal that you can say you helped cook, this is for you. If you're hoping to learn more about cooking, I'd say look elsewhere, or maybe to their 4 month practical series, which sits at a steeper price tag of $2500.\n\nCorrection! The practical series is 24 weeks long, not 4 months - definitely a better deal there!
