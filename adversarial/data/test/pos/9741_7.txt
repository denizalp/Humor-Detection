Being from new york I was so excited to eat breakfast here this morning but if your Black do not expect a Warm greeting or hospitable service, the waitress was sooo dull no smile she almost seemed annoyed to serve my friend and I but the second a group of white people came in she was super nice to them. She never asked how was the food or did we need anything, or if we were done , she brought us the check and basically was telling us to leave , never asked if I wanted more coffee or anything, this has to be the worst dirtiest place ive ever been? To in my life!
