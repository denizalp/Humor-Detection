I love this place.\n\nAfter the worst dining experience on the other side of Caesars at Michel Richard, my buddy and I sat down at the noodle counter and waited for it to open.\n\nI watched my noodles get made, cooked and prepared by the master noodle maker (i'm sure there is a Chinese word for this) and had the best bowl of Pork, Mushrooms and Noodles.\n\nI think my wife is still mad at me for not bringing her along.  Next time...
