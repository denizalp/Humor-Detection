Recently renovated and expanded, with new menus printed out.  Because of the expansion in both dining room and kitchen areas, the table service has improved but the front of house needs replaced.  Reservation for table of 7 at 7PM.  5 of the 7 arrived at 6:45 and were promptly seated. The remaining 2 (of which I was one) arrived at 6:55PM, asked front of house if the group had arrived, he checks the list, says no they're not here, and has us wait in the lobby.  10 minutes later I receive a text message from the first 5 saying they were already at their table ordering.  That was error #1.\n\nSo we find our group, join them, to find that they were getting served food, and we (the \"late\" people, who were actually 5 minutes EARLY) were not offered menus nor a chance to order until after the other members received their first courses.   In an attempt to appease the irate \"latecomers\" a waiter delivered to us 2 pieces of \"sushi\" which could best be described as cheap rice doused with mango puree.   I don't consider that to be worthy of consumption, and I consider it an insult to be served it.  That was error #2.  At least they finally got rid of that surly useless old hag of a waitress we always seemed to get who didn't speak a word of English and kept screwing up our orders.  Good riddance.  But the guy we had was a bit too touchy-feely with the customers plus he had BO. Bad combination.\n\nFood quality is what you could expect at a Chinese-run AYCE \"Japanese\" place, but the grilled eel was no longer on the menu, a staple that is found on EVERY sushi menu.  As well, they serve \"white tuna\" without telling you that it's actually escolar, a fish that can make you sick.  Sushi (nigiri) did not have wasabi included.   That was error #3. To their credit they had better quality beef for their Teppanyaki dishes, in the past they were no better than U.S. Select (Canada Grade A) quality, very gristly.  That was maybe the only pleasant surprise of the whole evening.\n\nTime for desserts, and again the \"ginger creme brulee\", which has been on the menu since the place went AYCE but we have never been able to get, STILL wasn't available.  If you're never going to have it, why did you include it on your \"new\" menu?  By seeing it on the new menu I expected to be able to order it, finally.  Maybe it's only served to their VIPs, or you have to speak Cantonese to get it?  In addition, those dessert servings are small enough to serve to 2 year olds, not grown adults.  One tiny golf-ball sized scoop of ice cream, really? That was error #4.  I will give them credit for excellent coconut ice cream... maybe I should have asked what brand it is so I can go buy it at T&T, as I seriously doubt it's house-made.\n\nLong story short, it seems like they resolved some of their previous issues stemming from the fact they crammed an AYCE place into a restaurant not originally designed for it, with way too many tables.  I would not have dined there if not for the fact we were part of the group.    It's too bad there isn't an AYCE sushi place actually run by Japanese.  I'd be willing to pay twice what these guys charge, for AUTHENTIC Japanese AYCE, not this Chinese garbage.
