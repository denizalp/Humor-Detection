My parents are particular. They want French cuisine. Only French cuisine. The restaurant shouldn't be too far. It shouldn't be too cold, too loud, too crowded. At the intersection of this ridiculous Venn diagram was Laloux. So we went. \n\nThe place was completely empty, which I thought was surprising at 6:00pm. Not complaining though. Our waitress was completely charming, she was friendly without being obnoxious and most importantly, she withstood my father's dad jokes for an hour and a half. Bravo!\n My dad tried their new tomato tart entr√©e, my mom went straight for the foie gras which is served in a light mango puree. I got the octopus, and I loved it! It came with fine crisps, ink, and the meat was so tender!\nBoth my parents ordered the duck magret, and it was a 50\/50 deal. My mom maintains hers was too leathery and she caught a nerve. My bavette was great, looked small but was very filling. You must think on your feet, the charming waitress arrives stealthily with a huge board of cheeses! The desserts were a bit underwhelming, the lemon tart was fresh, but a bit too minty, nothing bad to say about the profiteroles. The dulce mousse is a big blob, a delicious blob, but..blob!\n\nI was salivating over their ornate sampling menu (urchin mousse!) but all guests have to agree to it. Some other time I guess..
