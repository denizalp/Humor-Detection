Idk what the reviews are talking about\nThis pizza is salty and greasy af dough tasted like cardboard \nWait is super long with hardly any space to eat \nWe called in for a pizza and it took 45 min to be ready for pickup. (Make sure you call in the order to skip the line)\nThis place is 100% hype probably by drunken club goers \n1.50 for ranch what in the actual hell? Lame!
