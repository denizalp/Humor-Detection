I blew my MC2205 not too long ago and was told by Mcintosh that there is an authorized service center located in town.\n\nThis is no ordinary run of the mill shop. They deal mostly with vintage to high-end audio repair and are very knowledgeable in helping me understand the technical aspects of my amp. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone that needs help with repairs or just looking to buy equipment since they also sell.
