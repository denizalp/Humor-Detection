I must say I was very surprised how the great pizza was... Same concept as chipotle but with pizza...\n\nMy wife and I wanted to duplicate a California pizza kitchen barbecue chicken pizza and I must admit it was dead on fantastic!\n\nWe went with the thick crust which was a good move double chicken, double cilantro, Red onion, with a herb butter shmear on the crust, Some ricotta, and the barbecue sauce drizzled on top...\n\nThe pizza was actually large enough for the two of us... And they had this most wonderful watermelon ice tea... Definitely coming back... This place is a winner...\n\nThe wife gave it four stars I gave it 4 1\/2 actually 4 7\/8 that's why I posted five stars
