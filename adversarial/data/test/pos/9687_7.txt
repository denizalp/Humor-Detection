My company used to use this shop for retirement awards. We found that they were eager to sell you on using them, but then had some difficulty delivering what was agreed to. During our final transaction, one of the gentlemen that works here (I believe that it may have been the owner) just completely lost his temper when pushed to deliver what was agreed to. F Bombs included. Buyer beware.
