I've been living here since 1997 and during these years, I've tried the Bally's, Lifetime, 24hr, LA Fitness, JCC, La Camarilla, been guests at Phoenix CC, AZ Country Club, PV Country Club and my favorite still comes back to the Villages and I'm glad to be at this Camelback location. \n\nAfter taking a break from tennis, I'm back to playing and I'm loving it here. There is a new tennis director Will Whites and it's a very active tennis community. Since joining, I've met a lot of players from going to the cardio tennis MW 6-7am & Sat 7-8am, the drop in tennis on Fri mid day. The mixed doubles league in the evening is a social scene. Players stay after the matches and get together for drinks & food after- often staying until the bar area closes. \n\nIt's no secret I LOVE all the Villages for their friendly staff, immaculate fitness center, beautiful interior, extensive offering of yoga, Pilates & fitness classes & wonderful, heart thumping spin classes. There is racquetball, basketball, kid's summer camps. Even training for triathlons!!!  Not to mention their great swimming pool areas which recently they've added tables & chairs for a more relaxing atmosphere. I also LOVE their dressing rooms, jacuzzi & steam rooms. \n\nI wish they would add an outdoor jacuzzi so families could be in the jacuzzis together- a minor item compared everything else they offer. \n\nIt's not surprising after awhile, you make friends with the other members and it's not surprising to hear that there are multi generational family members too. \n\n If you read this review & decide to join, mention my name \nSu-shien Cho since all member referrals receive one free month of dues. \n\nJust join & thank me later- you'll love it here!!!
