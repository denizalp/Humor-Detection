I came here recently for their open mic night. Really this review is about the ambience on that evening, perhaps it is not the best assessment because I disliked the entertainment so much. The bar itself is cool, small but homey. Have a couple of beers on tap, nothing too fancy. But the comedy that night left much to be desired. The comics started around 9ish; pretty much all of them white males. The majority of the jokes centered around sex and women. I think these men are what one would call 'man child', as their jokes really were very immature. Don't get me wrong, I am a very open-minded individual and feel that comedy in this country tends to be very politically correct. But a lot of the jokes I heard that night were about domestic violence, attacks against minority groups, etc. There was also an abundance of pedofilia and priest jokes. And interestingly enough, a lot of talk about abortions (might I have found some supporters that night?). This will sound harsh, but it seems like these men are afraid of women. Not one made eye contact with me and I am not an intimidating person. We stook around for a good two hours because we just couldn't get over what was happening. \n\nI will be back because I've heard that their live music nights are cool. And the bartender that evening, Tracy, was very, very nice.
