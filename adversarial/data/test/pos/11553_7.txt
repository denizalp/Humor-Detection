I picked up take out from Chef Chiang yesterday.  $6.95 for the hunan chicken lunch special.  It comes with the entree, white or fried rice, egg drop or hot & sour soup, one crab rangoon, one fried wonton filled with some indistinguishable meat and one thin fried thing filled with cream cheese and possibly something else but I couldn't really taste anything besides cream cheese.\n\nThe crab rangoon had no discernable crab flavor.  If I had sent it off to a lab they may have found some I suppose.  The entree was soupy.  Very soupy.  The sauce was ok...nothing special.  It was a little spicy.  The veggie assortment in the chicken dish was pretty minimal and the only thing that tasted fresh was a little bok choy.\n\nI don't care for egg drop or hot & sour soup so I won't comment on that.  I didn't eat the egg roll.  It looked overdone & greasy.\n\nI probably won't go to Chef Chiangs again.  Mediocre at best.
