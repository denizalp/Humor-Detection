I thought about my review about for this place, but it was always between 2 and 3 stars for me.\n\nFWIW, the service was not bad. Our server was friendly and quite prompt... once he knew he was our server. Considering that the place was basically empty at 10pm on a Tuesday, there shouldn't be so much confusion.\n\nFarm Cafe boasts that as many as their ingredients as can be are locally sourced. When available. So who really knows what comes from where.\n\nThe food here is relatively uninspired. What it clearly aims to be is a generic casino cafe restaurant, but their prices aren't very cheap nor is there anything that screams 'interesting' on the menu.\n\nI ordered a meatloaf \"tower.\" I emphasize the word tower because in fact it was just a single slice of meatloaf. I'm not exactly sure how that qualifies as any sort of tall structure. The meatloaf was decent as was the gravy, but the onion strings were overdone and the plate consisted primarily of average mashed potatoes. The best item on the dish was the vegetables, which there were far too few of.\n\nI was there with six others, and asking around, the general attitude was \"meh.\" I'd have to agree. Honestly, I think the food might be better at Denny's, but it wasn't a big surprise.
