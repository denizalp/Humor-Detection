I was young and stupid when I went here, desperate for rent money. I had a family heirloom ring worth $4,000 and insured for $6,000.  At the time I had no idea what the ring was worth, but he must have.  Years later I found out that the stones were a very rare cut, and passed from generation to generation since the 1800s, set in 22kt European gold.  He gave me $400.  Asshole.
