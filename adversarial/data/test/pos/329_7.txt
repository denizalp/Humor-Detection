Always down to try a new boba place! Kept meaning to stop in here on my way home and today I did it. It's a modern shop and seemed to be a good place to hang out. They've got a varied menu with interesting drinks like strawberry horchata but I went with a safe choice and did black tea, after the employee let me know they were out of Thai tea.\n\nPrice points were good for the sizes, I got a 24oz black milk tea with boba (of course) and 75% sweetness level. I perused the shop as I waited as two other gals were also waiting for their drinks. The bobaista was handling orders and making the drinks so kudos to her, she was very nice too. Got my drink and noticed it was a regular cup with a lid, not sealed. The sweetness level was higher than I expected and it had a caramel or marshmallow flavor, maybe because they use black sugar boba, which was tasty. I didn't get a strong tea flavor, which would've been nice. They use crushed ice which isn't my favorite but it's cool. Next time I'll probably get a lower sweetness level and try something else!
