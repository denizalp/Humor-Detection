We went on a Tuesday night expecting that it wouldn't be so busy. However, since it's Summer, don't expect it to be any less busy for any day of the week. It was still packed! There were a lot of people lined up in what looked like a big crowded mess, so I feel like the staff could've done a better job creating an area for a single file line. The guy on watch was just standing there as new people who wanted to go on the ride were wondering where the hell they were supposed to go to. However, the wait time into the ride itself wasn't so bad as there were customers coming in and out of the viewing pod at all times, due to the way it's structured. \n\nThat brings me to my biggest blunder. The ride is boring, absolutely boring. Especially for the price too! My boyfriend and I paid 30 bucks each for a total of 60 dollars. It takes forever just to get to the scenic views of the strip, and while I must say that the views are actually nice, it definitely is not 60 dollars worth of \"nice.\" The Ferris wheel lasts for 30 minutes long, going in one full rotation before it is over. Within that rotation, a good lets-say 15 minutes of it is just waiting for the view to arrive. The view is just as good going to the top level of a parking garage and taking pictures there. By the time we did get to the top and had taken our pictures, we sat back down legitimately wondering when we'd get back to the bottom and leave to go back to our sight seeing. \n\nOn the bright side, I'll admit that my boyfriend is an absolute pussy. He hates heights of all kind, and this viewing pod definitely made him feel safe, perhaps due to the spaciousness and the slow pace it was going at. However the pace could be a good or bad thing depending on the person. \n\nI give this attraction three stars because this is definitely something worth experiencing, but not for what it's priced at.
