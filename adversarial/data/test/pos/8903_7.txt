Horrible Customer Service! I called them to fix my garage door that had fallen off the track. They were very efficient in making it out in time and fixed it. After 1 day it started acting up. It was getting caught, bouncing and not going all the way up. I called back to see if I could get them back out. I started by tell the guy what i paid for them to come out and fix it, this is what they fixed, and now it's acting up...etc... The guy immediately sounded irritated with me. As our conversation went on he told me \"you paid $75 for 30 minutes of work, now I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but that doesn't include warranty\" I WAS LIKE... DID THIS GUY JUST FUCKING SAY THAT TO ME!!!! I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT... ASSHOLE! I told him that I would look around and call back if I decided to go with his company. He then told me in a completely condescending way, \"Now you understand it will be $75 if you do?\"  Never again will I deal with this company, nor recommend them... I will recommend to people who not to call that's for sure!
