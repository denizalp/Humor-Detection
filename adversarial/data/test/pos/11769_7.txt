If I could give a negative rating I would. With that said If you have to go here then go but...\n\nA little over a year ago I had to go to the ER and after waiting for over two hours when there was no body in front of me and it was early and not busy I finally got seen by a doctor for like two minutes who was rude and then I never saw him again. \n\nI had a lady come in and mop my room while the nurse was putting in an IV in my arm!!! Uhhh, hello, do you think could have maybe come back a little later?\n\nI had another nurse who was there to take my blood pressure info just leave the machine on and it beeped for the next 15 mins until finally in all my pain (I later found out I had a kidney stone) I got up and asked someone to turn it off. \n\nMy nurse wouldn't give me any information about what the tests I was getting were for. The room was 71 degrees and I had to ask 3 different people for a warm blanket even AFTER my boyfriend called the nurses station from work to get them to bring me one. \n\nThe place seemed dirty and unsanitary, I mean I guess it was due to all the construction they had to wheel me through but even that was ridiculous. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention the left over sticky things, the ones that they use to connect your heart to machines, in my gown that I noticed. I was never hooked to a heart machine... That means they were who ever had the gown on before I did. That's gross!.\n\nThen I had to deal with all the payment info and not one person I talked to yet has been helpful. They all seem to be \"busy\" and rude and they act like I'm bugging them for calling the 800 number to get my payments squared away. Ugh! \n\nNow, I have to deal with the billing folks again. Why, you ask? Oh because they decided not to send me my last bill and even after talking to mulitple people asking them to send me a bill to my new address and them agreeing to. I guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections. Thanks JCL! You guys are swell folks. So today I call in asking to see if we can get this fixed. That I WANT to pay my bill. That I had no intention of not paying it. That there was no reason for it to go into collections. Pat (the lady I spoke to) was no help, so I asked to talk to a supervisor or manager. She put me on hold for about 8 mins and then some how the phone call got disconnected (nice). So I called back, she didn't answer so I left a message. That was at 8am it's now 6pm and no phone call back. Geez that's great customer service.\n\nIf you have to go then go but if you can hold out for a better hospital then I recommend the extra driving in the end it will be less of a headache.
