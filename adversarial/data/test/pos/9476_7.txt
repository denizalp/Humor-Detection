This review is for dinner at the Veranda.  I've only had breakfast or brunch here.  The restaurant ran a Black Friday special.  Call on Black Friday, make a reservation for dinner some night in December, and receive 50% off.  That's a great deal!\n\nI had a reservation for 6.  There was only one other table occupied when I arrived but it soon got busy.  My server was Jose and he proved., along with all the staff, to be pleasant, polite, and very efficient!\n\nI ordered 4 things--pear salad, ahi tuna crudo, Penne Tegame, and an apple and fig crostata for dessert.  First I was brought water and quickly the iced tea I ordered.  \n\nThe starter was the pear salad.  Their menu describes it as Bartlet Poached Pear, Spiced Goat Cheese, Endive, Pecans, Porto Dressing.  It was excellent.  The pieces of pear in the endive leaves with the goat cheese was an amazing combination.  The pecans added a texture element that was perfect.\n\nNext up was the crudo of very thinly sliced ahi tuna with balsamic soy dressing and guacamole. An interesting combination with ahi tuna but it worked very well.\n\nFor the main course, I bypassed the signature pasta dish and instead went with the penne Tegame with a spicy Roma tomato and parsley sauce and mozzarella.  The red flecks of pepper could be seen and tasted throughout the dish.  The spiciness was not overwhelming for anyone.  It was excellent.\n\nJose suggested the cannoli for dessert but I chose something different, the warm apple and fig crostata.  It had an orange and vanilla bean reduction\/panna cotta gelato.  I am generally not a fan of warm desserts but this was amazing!  Very delicious and an excellent ending to a delightful meal.\n\nService was the best!  My iced tea never got more than an inch down from the top when the glass was refilled.  Plates were removed quickly, and people addressed me by my last name taken from the reservation.  This is what I expect from a Four Seasons restaurant and they didn't fail.  In addition, I received a phone call on the way home because they thought they had found an item I may have left behind.  They were in error, but it shows the detail to service that's paired with great food.\n\nI'll be coming back for that signature pasta dish.  I have to check it out!
