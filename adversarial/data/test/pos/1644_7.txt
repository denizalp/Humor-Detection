Tim Hortons is a Canadian fast food restaurant, known particularly for their coffee and doughnuts.  There are some THs out in the Midwest, but it's pretty overwhelming in terms of the number of locations that they have in Montreal!  The menu is pretty extensive, offering coffee, teas, specialty hot\/cold beverages, breakfast items, sandwiches, soups, bagels, cookies, doughnuts, and yogurts.  Located conveniently off the Place-des-Arts Metro, the hubs and I came here for a quick little snack.  We tried the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich, a breaded white meat chicken patty topped with lettuce, tomato, and spicy mayo sauce, all in a white bun.  This was pretty okay in taste, and it came with a complimentary side of kettle cooked potato chips.  Service was more of a miss, as the employees were playing 'tag' behind the counter; they were oblivious to the number of patrons waiting in line to order (!).  There are plenty of seats to dine-in, and they also offer free wi-fi.\n\n+Canadian fast food chain\n+complimentary kettle chips with combo\n+underwhelming service\n+free wi-fi
