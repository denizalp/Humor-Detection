I went here for breakfast with the hubby last Sunday.  I was happy to find a place close by to have a nice relaxing breakfast that wasn't completely packed with families whose kids are extremely cranky after being stuck at church all morning.  We were seated right away and I only heard two screaming toddlers the whole time we were there (avg number of screaming kids at a Ihop or Mimi's on a Sunday is more like 8 to 10).\n\nI had the Monte Cristo and it was awesome!  The menu didn't say that it came with a side and the waitress didn't ask so I got potatoes but I would have really preferred fruit.  The hubby was also happy with his standard order of steak and eggs.  The best part was that all their bottles of wine are $10 off on Sundays so we were able to get our mimosas on at a bargain.  They didn't seem to mind that we hung out for a while and our waitress still kept being friendly and checking on us instead of trying to turn the table.  \n\nI will definitely be back for dinner and or happy hour since the place had a cool vibe and a great menu for the L&D part, too.
