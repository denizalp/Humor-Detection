If your willing to make ridiculous office charges to sit in a nicely decorated office the this is the place to be! \n\nI have an appointment scheduled for 12:30pm and called in at about 8:15am. I called to reschedule my appointment due to a flat tire I was told that I would be charged a fee of $50 to cancel the appointment. When I tired to explain my situation the office desk didn't care to hear it. They said they could push my appointment back to 2pm and when I said I will not be able to take that time due to my children getting off school there was nothing they could do for me.\n\nWhen I asked to speak to the office manager I was transferred over. Monique was the office manager who I spoke with she also didn't care to much to hear about my situation. I understand that a fee is charged but I don't think it's ok to show absolutely no empathy towards clients. She was cold and direct about the charge. That's all they cared about to make a point to charge me. I don't care about the $50 charge it upset me so much to not even feel like they would accommodate anything for their clients. Pushing the appointment back 1 hour and 30 mins was all they can do and apparently cause my children get off at that time it's my problem I can't make it to the only other appointment they have. After the frustration of dealing with all this in the morning I responded to Monique \"It's a F*cking flat tire\" I'm doing everything I can. She then quickly said \"I will not be spoken to like that.\" And informed me she would inform the Dr and the charges will be up to her. She was quick so show some type of emotion when I drop the F* bomb but throughout our entire conversation before that I felt like I was talking to a wall.\n\nIf I get this $50 charge for Flat Tire then I'll pay the charge. No one deserves to deal with an unexpected situation and do their best to work around it for the other party to give them no options. $50 charge vs. the amount of time I would have been loyal to this office. Service is everything to me. They have enough clients I'm sure the loss of one won't affect them.\n\n****The response I received from my post provided by this office clearly shows they do not pay attention to detail. The response says they try to accommodate yet tell you that there is no later time when you try to reschedule due to unexpected events? That's not accommodating to anyone. The variety of contact options has nothing to do with the rudeness I experienced from the management and office staff. I don't need to be told what contact options I have clearly I contacted the office as early as 8am. After being provided with no solution I was told by the office manager I would receive a call by end of day which I never did. Instead of telling your clients options of communication educate your team. The fact that the office manager stated she would give me a call by end of day and never did SHOWS that this office does not follow what they preach. I also said in my previous review that the fee isn't the issue its the treatment by the staff.
