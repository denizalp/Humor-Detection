Stayed the weekend at HotelRed down the street and passed this place by on the walk to the bar on Friday.  As a native Chicagoan, I can't help but take notice of a place advertising pizza and gyros in the same location.  Obviously, this was a monumental opportunity to combine two of my favorite late night foods, and the experience would effect itself after an appropriately drunken beer fest the following day.\n\nAnticipating my state of mind for Saturday evening, I did my research in the morning when my BAC was at a socially acceptable level.  To my surprise, Pizza Extreme neglects to include two of the most extreme of pizza ingredients on their menu: gyro meat and tzatziki.\n\nPost beerfest, I walked over to Pizza Extreme and posited my plan to the guy behind the counter: I wanted a proper gyro pizza, cost be damned.  He informed me that he'd made a few in the past and that I'd surely be satisfied.  Once evaluating my seriousness (\"Of course I want tzatziki as the sauce.\"), he took my order and told me he'd have it ready in 15 minutes.  As I turned to walk out, he enthusiastically proposed including feta cheese.  A true buongustaio.\n\nI returned shortly* to pick up my extreme pie.  It was made with care and sure to satisfy.  Quite honestly, it was the best specialty pizza I've had (take that, Ian's).\n\nSeriously guys, put a gyro pizza on the menu.\n\n*It should be noted that I returned with pizza from Pizza Brutta down the street.  The pang of betrayal was clear on my dear chef's face.  For that, I am truly sorry.  Alas, I associate with fools who were not nearly as enthused as I was for such refined melding of trans-Ionian culinary institutions.
