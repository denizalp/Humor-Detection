It's all about the schnitzel, baby!  We got the Jaegerschnitzel which the menu described as \"two tender 'Hunter Style' breaded pork cutlets topped with our secret mushroom gravy and served with fresh house spaetzle.\".  Man oh man was this fantastic.  The cutlets were big and very juicy.  The spaetzle was excellent too.    \n\nWe also got the \"Wurstplatte\" which was a sausage sampler that came with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut consisting of two of each of their 3 homemade sausages.  Interestingly enough, my favorite was my wife's least fave.  I really enjoyed the \"bockwurst\" which was their white sausage flavor the best, she preferred the beer bratwurst.  No problem then..more for me!  \n\nThe apple streudel on display looked damn good so we got one of those too.  I really liked the doughyness of it.  \n\nI am holding out on 5 stars til they get a liquor license and I can guzzle some steins of beer with their delicious food.  Anybody out there in Yelpworld got some pull?  The owner said she's been waiting for 9 months already.  \n\nThey also have a dinner buffet the first Saturday of every month.  Count on us being there Dec 1st!
