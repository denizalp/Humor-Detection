I Decided to stop by here out of desperation of not being able to find anything remotely healthy in the area.\n\nI ordered one of their salads with cranberries, feta cheese, and vinaigrette.  the salad was good and the services was great.\n\nIts nice to find a small business that cares about quality and their customers.  \n\nI'll be back for more!
