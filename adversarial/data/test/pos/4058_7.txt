I bought a tdi Jetta from Berge and the black one we originally bought was delivered with multiple cosmetic dings dents, and swirls in the paint. I will presume it came from the buffing \nmachine, but it was so noticeable that after multiple hmm's and haww's their response was there is no such thing as a perfect black car. We walked away from the deal, but we were threatened with their legal department and later settled on a white Jetta. \n\nNext, we have ran into multiple service issues, which Berge continually using the excuse they need to check with VW warranty approvals, but will not offer rental cars and let you sit for hours in the waiting room until you get so frustrated you demand your vehicle back or you can pay for the repairs and they will reimburse you later. Today, is a prime example. I am in for an oil change and some other service related items. We were promised a loaner vehicle and they needed just about a 1\/2 hour to conduct diagnosis.\n\n It's been 4+ hours now, they've been almost done for 3 hours and if we hear the transmission clunking around, smell the odor coming from the vents, or the car stalls, bring it back in, but as far as today the car checks out perfectly. LOL!!! \n\n We are just waiting for our car back to take it to a different dealer. VW is a great car, just the service department in my case is horrible! Drive the distance to a different service department. Trust me on this one!
