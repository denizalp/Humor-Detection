I took in three or four plastic grocery bags of cans at the end of  my last trip here and got about a dollar.  This trip I had about twice to three times that much, two kitchen trash bags full.  It still came to only $1.80 for three pounds.  At least it wasn't far to drive here, but still hard to justify the energy saving them other than the reward of knowing I was recycling.  \n\nI saw pickup trucks loaded with metals lined up going in a different entrance and the guy ahead of me inside the office got over $50, so I guess it's worth it if you have enough pounds of scrap metal.
