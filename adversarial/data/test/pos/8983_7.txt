Lebanese food is something I'm not very well versed in. You see folks, in a land far far away where I grew up in Central Canada it's not very common. So I've only experienced it the last 11 years of my life. Also, it's not a cuisine I seek out on a more than frequent basis. Most of what's readily available are what one in Quebec would call casse croute (junk food) Lebanese Schwarma places. They still are delicious, however it is junk food no matter how you slice and dice it. \n\nOn a casual meetup with a friend he suggested La Cave du roi. We always try to go to new places. I'm thinking....I like the name!  The cave of the king in literal English translation. I was thinking before I arrived, what kind of King would possibly live in a cave? A king would typically live in a lavish palace? Would you digress? \n\nWhen I'm at an establishment with a huge menu offering I find it hard to decide what to order? So my friend mentioned Lebanese is great as you can order a bunch of small plates. Fantastic. With a few questions and suggestions from the server we were on our way. The table came with a bag of pita bread. We ordered fattoush salad, hummus, baba ghanoush, soujouk, kafta, filet mignon and to finish it off was an atayef with Lebanese coffee. It truly was a meal fit for a King! \n\nExceptional standout from the meal was the fattoush salad. The kafta and fillet mignon were cooked perfectly also. The soujouk was okay. I'd probalaby not be in a rush to order again and all the small plates were a great compliment. I've never had atayef before but it was a nice finishing point with a strong espresso style coffee. Overall a very nice meal. We went a little crazy and thus it was $32 after tax and 15% tip. There are reasonable options that should run you around $15 for lunch but we went a bit gangbusters. \n\nOnly downside to the meal was we entered the restaurant early and were the only ones seated. Then a group of about 10 people entered and in an otherwise empty restaurant they sat them right up against us. You know the feeling when a loud boisterous group competes for volume and is seated next to you? Yup... That's what happened to us. A minor annoyance to an otherwise excellent meal.
