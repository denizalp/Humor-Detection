\"So where do you want to eat tonight, since you're the visitor?\" Nathan asked as we piled into the car.  \n\n\"Um, I have no freaking clue,\" I said uncertainly.  \"How about Asian food?\"\n\n\"We could take you to the most decent Thai place in the area,\" Anna suggested.\n\n\"Most Decent Thai?  That's teh best name ever!\"  And so began a delightful culinary experience.\n\nThara Thai (forever known to me as Most Decent Thai), is the best you're going to hope for in all of scenic Champaign-Urbana, Illinois.  If you have scaled your expectations appropriately, you will appreciate it for the deliciosity that it is.  We had panang curry, mock duck, and green curry, and all were tasty.  They do make it terrifyingly spicy if you ask, so an ample warning served to keep my meal on the \"hot\" side rather than \"San Diego Wildfire\" (too soon?).\n\nThe decor is a strange amalgamation between Thai restaurant and pancake house, which I am convinced it once was.  Something vaguely Alpine\/German lurks beneath the varnished wooden seats and gaudy Thai calendar images, I'm just saying.\n\nWell worth it for a food stop if you're in C-U, or if you end up becoming a graduate student at UIUC, which I am heavily, heavily considering doing....
