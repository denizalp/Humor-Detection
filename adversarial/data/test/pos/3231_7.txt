Came for dinner with my family. We were served fresh tortilla chips with 3 different salsas. Wow! Loved that the chips were very fresh and still warm.  The salsas were very good. The salsa Verde was my favorite by far hut all were very good! I ordered the asada taco plate. It came with two different types of rice and beans. I was not impressed by the tacos however. There wasn't really anything special about them. The rice and beans were ok too. I did have a bite of the asada quesadilla and that was good.  Didn't try anything else besides a couple of drinks which were delicious. Service was good and they were very polite.  Cute spot with several rooms that were divided into different sections. Very nice and relaxing atmosphere!
