Party of 7 please.  Do you have a happy hour? Yes, handing me a placard with 6 appetizers that are 1-2 dollars off..  Ok, give me one of everything, please. I'm used to saving more than a dollar at happy hour but, the apps ARE good.\n\nOur waitress CJ then explains in Thai to my wife and daughter a couple of the dishes.  We order 7 entrees and they arrive in a timely fashion and were all quite tasty.\n\nProblem 1  The sticky rice which came with the pork dish was about the size of two of my fingers, should have been at least 4x -10x as much.\n\nProblem 2.  The rice which came with 2 of our entress was fine but, we ordered EXTRA rice and, that didn't show up until most of the main dishes were gone.  Even after asking a second and third time, it took 4-5 minutes for them to scoop it out of the rice cooker and bring it,  Not cool, guys.\n\nThis is my third time here and it is ok but, 5 stars?--not.
