GREEN TEA LATTE!\n\nThis is definitely a cute little cafe! Korean owned as you could tell from the Korean music that they play! The place have about maybe 10 tables inside & they have a couple of tables out on the patio area. simple decor. Cute little hand drawn paintings on the window. Definitely a nice place to hang out w\/ friends or by yourself when you wanna have some quality alone time w\/ your computer while having a nice drink. \n\nThe staff is friendly & they bring your drinks or food out to you when you dine in. \n\nGREEN TEA LATTE $4.50- This latte is just PERFECT!!! i love the perfect amount of sweetness & creaminess while still kicking out the flavor of green tea to it! Plus they make it all PURRTTYYY!! w\/ a little flower design w\/ the foam.\n\nCHICKEN PESTO SANDWICH $8.75 - This sandwich was a lot tastier than i thought it would have been! The bread was warm & toasted w\/ the perfect amount of crunch to each bite. Although i did have to push the sandwich down a little to fit in my mouth. The PESTO was a perfect amount & not overwhelming. Served w\/ a choice of salad or chips, of course i chose the potato chips since having a sandwich is already healthy enough for me. ahahaha
