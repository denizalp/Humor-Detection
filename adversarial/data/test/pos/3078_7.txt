Are the women attractive? Yes\n\nDo they try to play you? Absolutely. To the point it sickens me.\n\nFunny as it can be, this would be the only time that I go out, that I can turn down women left and right.\n\nSince we had a section reserved for us, we did not have to pay cover to get in. Plus we had 1 bottle of champagne for us.\n\nAfter walking in this darkly dim lit establishment, a women immediately came to me to try sweet talk me into going into the VIP room. I declined, as I just want to settle in before the ladies of the night try to brisk away my hard earned money.\n\nThis place is a bit too dark. I have been to other establishments like this, and they aren't as dark as this place. I can understand some women may feel that they don't look that attractive in the light, but that is beyond the opposite of what 99% of men think. When we see a basically nude woman, looks don't matter too much.\n\nThe size of the place is small in my opinion. I feel claustrophobic when I'm trying to navigate.\n\nBesides that, the ladies here are very attractive and definitely turn you into a child walking into a Candy store. Many flavors of different sizes, but also cost a lot of money to get what you want.\n\nWe came here because our friend is getting married, and what better idea than to check out a strip club.\n\nThe women here I swear are reading a script to me, when they try to push aggressively the $230 dollar private dance with 2 drinks. I just want to relax and at my own whim, choose and spend wisely. The 99% of us are not that rich to blow money on them or anything in general. Treat us well, and we will treat you back well.\n\nI did end up finding a lovely and nice lady for a dance, and noticed a friend of mine next to me getting a dance. Great, we're both having a great time.\n\nWell it didn't last too long, because shortly after that, the dancer that my friend had, had basically tried to extort money from my friend. He had assumed (bad, right? Never assume!) that someone had paid for his dance. Once she finished, he had thanked her, and she demanded cash for it. She did not go up and present herself and asked if he wanted a dance. She had walked up and immediately gave him a dance. \n\nI know, it's Vegas.... never assume anything is free or \"taken\" care of. That immediately ruined the mood for my friend.. once he's moody, it kinda ruins everyone else's mood.\n\nI don't like how some of them would assume he's a novice and take advantage of the situation. This reflects poorly on the establishment, and the trust with the customer. There is never a need to do that. Because in the end, the customer loses. Had we not have the cash in hand, I bet he would of gotten beat up by the bouncer. It's the houses word against the customer, and the house always wins.
