Ms. Lisa (kindergarten teacher) has left, and with it, the last remaining reason anyone might have for continuing to stay at DCS. \n\nThe school is now just a revolving door for first and second year teachers trying to find a job, and then leaving when they realize that working for this administration just isn't worth the below average wages that are being paid here. \n\nI was fully prepared for a culture change when the new administration took over, unfortunately they didn't replace the previous culture with anything of value. \n\nIt took us an entire year to leave because we wanted to try to make it work after fighting so hard to keep our school, but the new administration could not seem to get even the basics right. Every communication with staff and teachers seemed overly complicated, and ineffective, it was sooo incredibly frustrating.
