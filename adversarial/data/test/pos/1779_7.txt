Came here for the all-you-can-eat sushi Sunday.\nThe restaurant is beautiful. Food is ok. They make great special rolls, and I liked the spider, dragon and crunchy rolls the best. However, not as good for the regular rolls or sashimi or maki.\n\nNow here's the huge complaint about their service.\nAfter we got a table and had our water. I asked if I could exchange for another plate, because there were so many broken edges on my plate. The waitress told us that there's no need to change because every plate is like that. And to our amazement, wow every plate is really as what she said. \nAfter we placed our order, we waited 30 minutes to get our appetizer and other food. You can't order until you finish all your food, totally reasonable to avoid wasting food, but does it really take that long? We tried again a couple times, after we ordered, it does take 30 minutes for the next round of food. \nAt last, not to mention, there's an already added 18% tip on the bill, while none of us actually wanted to leave a tip.\n\nNot coming back again!!!!!!!!!!!!
