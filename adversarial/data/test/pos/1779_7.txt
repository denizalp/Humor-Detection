I have been waiting forever to see this show and my expectations were exceeded. \n\nI can't even sum up in words how spectacular it was and even though I just came back from Vegas, I'm planning my next trip for the sole purpose of seeing the show again.\n\nI'm in love with the Jabbawockeez even MORE than i was before (if that was even possible) and seeing them in the flesh was AMAZING.  Watching them dance in person is much much better than watching them through the TV or youtube.
