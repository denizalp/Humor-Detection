In a city teeming with Mexican and Spanish cuisine, Ticoz offers more.  Its melange of Latin inspired dishes, lovingly prepared by Chef Holly Gibson, offer a variety of flavors from Puerto Penasco (Ticoz Street Tacos) to the Caribbean (Coconut GInger Curry Rice).\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Chef Holly when coming here for a \"YAP.\" (Yelper Appreciation Party)  Invitees were lured by drink tickets and a specially prepared spread.  Ticoz' reputation had previously awakened my culinary curiosity, so this was my first experience of the restaurant and its food.\n\nAhhh, the sight before me when I walked into the restaurant brought back visions of nights in Puerto Vallarta; ordering tacos and tostadas from street vendors at 2 in the morning.  Or was it the talk I had with Chef Holly, when she talked of her inspiration for one of Ticoz Signatures?  Though she grew up in Arizona (so rare, i know!) she spent much time in Mexico, vacationing with family.  It is here where she discovered the \"street taco\" and brought it back to Phoenix. \n\nI was to enjoy four of these ambrosial tacos the night of the event.  House braised meats on soft corn tortillas, festooned with cabbage, and blanketed with chipotle and an avocado crema.  To give the right amount of tribute, I want to describe Chef Holly's simple secrets to the taco meats.  The chicken is braised  in pineapple and chipotle, the beef in lime and cilantro, and the pork in orange and clove.  These make for distinct flavor combinations, and the juiciest and most tender meat.   The tacos caused a great well being, as everyone was magically transported to the Mayan riviera, with a cold margarita in hand.\n\nI have to digress here, because i just typed one of my favorite words.  Margarita.  I easily enjoyed four of them, to go with the four tacos.  I could not help myself, they were pure titillation.  Not to mention, all the exotic libations are1\/2 off between the hours of 4:00p-6:30p.   An unbeatable value, considering the average tropical cocktail here costs only $7.   In addition, the owners were extremely generous in offering its \"Yelping\" patrons two free drink tickets - even for 16oz. of jubilation.  \n\nThe drinks deserve a list all on their own:\n#1 Coconut Margarita.  (who would have thunk that agave and coconut make great bedfellows? a first for me, now i will never go back to anything less than...)\n#2  Passion Fruit Margarita. (a contender for the number one spot. perfect balance of ingredients - so much so that one hardly tastes the tequila and instead thinks they are plucking Maracuya from the vine.)\n#3 Blackberry Margarita. (hold me back! I thought there was nothing more divine than a blackberry capirinha.)\n#4 Lychee Margarita. (this sweet and fragranced fruit makes the cadillac margarita pale in comparison)\n\nI will not admit to drinking any more than the above stated, but I did sample the other signature cocktails such as the kiwi white sangria, and the peach mojito.  With so many exotic and enticing blendings of flavors, I was overwhelmed.  The list of flavor combinations for mojitos and sangrias, as well as margaritas and martinis goes on...I only wished my liver had not been so well fortified after my drinking expedition.  I would have explored the wilds of this potable jungle, but I settled instead with putting the flowers, that came as decorative adornments in the drinks, in my hair.\n\nSo, after that wonderful veer, my focus was back on the food.  Other items my taste buds explored on the generous spread were the BBQ meat sliders, as well as the pork tostillados and guacummus.  What is guacammus?  It is Ticoz famous blend of house made guacamole and garlic hummus - a unique gathering of mediterranean and caribbean.  Go Chef Holly!\n\nWhat one will find here on the appetizer menu are the characteristic  southwestern and even south american comfort foods such as empanadas (a taste of buenos aires) and flautas.  In addition to the guacammus, the basket of corn waffle fries seasoned wtih lime and chipotle distinguishes this eatery from the rest.\n\nMore than a half dozen salads grace the menu, with unique ingredients such as grilled peaches or hearts of palm.  Burgers and sandwhiches are available for the unadventurous, but the signature dishes is where Ticoz defines itself as a Latin Restaurant.\n\nFrom the house Paella prepared in a citrus saffron broth, to the shrimp and lobster arroz in crab filled coconut rice - Ticoz will give you a small tour of the Latin World.
