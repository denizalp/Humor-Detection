It's a lovely park and the problem isn't with it itself; it's with the parkgoers. \n\nSimple as this: KEEP YOUR DOG ON A LEASH. \n\nI know, I know, your dog is different, it doesn't need a leash. It's not about your dog, it's about the safety of others and their dogs. Dogs on a leash get more aggressive toward dogs that aren't on one because they are more protective of their owner when they're on the leash. If you have your dogs just romping down a narrow trail without a leash they're going to run into another dog eventually.\n\nYou aren't special. You think the rules don't apply to you, but they do. Pittsburgh Police should have a plain clothes officer walking the trails handing out the $300 citations all the leash law signs in the park that people clearly cannot read.\n\nThe exercise areas in the fenced dog park area are more than enough space to play hours of fetch with your dogs, you shouldn't be doing it in the grassy areas next to the trail. \n\nToday alone I saw a husky, a rot, two german shepherds, and countless bigger mixes off leash outside the dog park on the trails. You're going to get someone hurt or another dog hurt; and it's going to be the dogs that suffer most because the city can't force you to be put down instead. \n\nGet over yourselves.
