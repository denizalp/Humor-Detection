Believe the hype. \n\nMy 5-year old HP laptop is a true workhorse. It finally began to have an issue and I was receiving a hard disk error. Luckily my files and photos were backed up (register with mozy.com if you haven't already, it's a lifesaver) and I turned to Yelp for a reliable computer repair recommendation. \n\nI read the reviews and called the shop. Staff was knowledgeable, helpful and made me feel at ease. My computer was done within 48 hours. They removed my failing hard disk, replaced it with a non-spinning one and my laptop operates super fast, just like a brand new one. Thank you Computer Repair Las Vegas!!!
