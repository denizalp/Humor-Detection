Stopped in here for the first time tonight. The decor\nIsn't anything to write home about but the service is super friendly and welcoming. I tried the penne alla vodka. It's probably one of the best I've found in town. And not expensive, $12.99. You order at the counter and then seat yourself and they bring the food out to you. It's cozy with just about 8-10 tables. I think they do a lot of take out\/delivery business. The pizza looks amazing. My friend had a huge NY slice. The pie are sooooo big! Can't wait to try a slice next time. Definitely excited to find this gem.
