We stayed at Encore and we decided to have lunch here. Boy, did we choose the wrong place.\n\n1. They have a thing called \"stop-seating\", where they take a couple of parties, seat them, stop the line from moving for 30 minutes, then repeat. Why they do this when they have a bunch of empty tables available for seating? I have no clue.\n\n2. The menu is very limited and when we finally ordered, it took more than 30 minutes for our food to arrive, AND we weren't served any bread baskets, when other tables clearly had. How long does it take to make some scrambled eggs and toast? Definitely not 30-40 minutes. The toast were also completely burnt, but we didn't ask them to replace them since we didn't want to take the chance of waiting even longer. My side order of onion rings came out before my main dish, which I found to be weird and they were more soggy than crispy. My main dish, a Ham & Cheese sandwich, didn't come out for another 20 minutes.\n\n3. The food was mediocre, but the last straw was when we waited 20 minutes for our bill.  We were at the cafe for about 2 hours, and 90 minutes of that was spent waiting including waiting to be seat). If the food was delicious, all may have been forgiven, but the food was mediocre and pricey considering quality and quanitity.\n\nI'm never eating here again.
