Freshest cilantro, radishes, greens and onions. The quality of limes seems a bit inconsistent. They have the cheapest bottled water. The smell when you walk in is a little off. One day it smelled like wet dog :\/ I can't complain too much since it's the closest grocer to my neighborhood and the customer service is very good compared to other places I do food shopping. Even the security guard was nice even though I had \"don't mess with me\" face on......hahaha :) Therefore, F.C. I will bump your stars from 3 to 4.
