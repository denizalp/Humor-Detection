The \"Y\"  inserted in \"Taco y Taco\" must stand for YUMMY right?? Because that's what they are! FINALLY I found a really good place for my taco fix!!\n\nNot only do they have a variety choices of meats like Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas, Lengua,  Tripas, they also have vegetarian choices and the make a mean crunchy taco with soyrizo! (pic - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/taco-y-taco-las-vegas?select=yC13HfZPcIaWAYI-_IZIGA#yC13HfZPcIaWAYI-_IZIGA) The seasonings worked well and I would order it even if it wasn't Meatless Monday!\n \nThe Go Tos - Al Pastor - rotating on a spit..well marinated. Every visit so far the slices I got have always been juicy and meat was never tough.\n \nLengua - My personal favorite! Meat is so tender and seasoned right!\n\nElote\/Corn - Mexican street style is THE way to go! They roll it in creamy buttery mayo and sprinkle it with seasonings. So good!\n \nSalsa Bar - the creamy looking green sauce is my favorite and apparently pretty popular because it's the one that always needs to be refilled. It's a mild salsa. (I cant handle too much heat)\n \nAll the meats sizzling on their grill, I was told by their employees come straight from the meat market Los Compadres, because the owners (Taco y Taco's) dad own that grocery store.\n \nThe Drill - Self Serve for dining or to go orders -  Walk up to each of the designated stations and they'll take and custom make your order, pay and order your drinks with the cashier at the end.  Salsa bar located in the dining room area.\n  \nThe staff is cool people!! Friendly! First time we were there they were so helpful.  \n\nThe place is clean. The strip mall itself is clean. Parking is no problemo.\n  \nI like the set up of the dining area. Open and bright. Plenty of seating! Hmmm perfect for a UYF! (Unofficial Yelp FIESTA!)
