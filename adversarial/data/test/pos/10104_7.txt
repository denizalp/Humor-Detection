There are a number of restaurants in the valley that try too hard to be southwestern. Cartwright's nails it without smacking you in the face with the decorations.\nAs soon as you walk in you're transformed. Ever watch old episodes of Bonanza? Remember the ranch house? It's sort of that feeling.  Rustic, but classy.\n\nThe food and the service are both terrific. The servers are knowledgeable, friendly and more than happy to explain things.  They have an extensive menu and they even have gluten-free selections.  I don't come here often so I always order the same things. For an appetizer try the Red Chili Elk Balls (not only are they good but it's fun to say and no, they aren't really elk testicles). My go-to entree is the trio of tenderloin medallions: 3-oz each of beef, elk and bison buffalo.  How many opportunities do you have in life to have elk and bison buffalo? Don't let this opportunity pass you by.  \n\nSadly I'm always too full when it comes time for dessert so you're on your own there.  I did notice that they have vegan and gluten-free dessert choices so if you're trying to appease your vegan friend that just watched you devour beef, elk and buffalo this might work out for you.
