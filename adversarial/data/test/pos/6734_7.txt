I just returned from dinner at Chelsea's kitchen. I was entertaining a group of five people and wanted to show them a great experience. We started out with appetizers and wine and everything was going well. We loved our corner table. All of the sudden a staff member named Natasha sweeps up to our table and asks if we would be willing to move in order to accommodate a gentleman's 80th birthday who is set on having our corner table. I was reluctant. It didn't feel right but everyone at the table wanted to accommodate this 80-year-old gentleman so we gladly moved to a smaller table.\n\nWe watched that corner table all night and an 80-year-old never appeared. The oldest person at that table was about 30. There were lots of exercise buffs and one young pregnant woman. No 80-year-old in sight\n\nWhile the service at our new table was good, the waiter was cheery, and the food was good: This did not offset the fact that we felt duped by Natasha. Apparently someone slipped her enough money to make it worthwhile to uproot us. So that free first round of drinks and dessert did not offset the sour taste in our mouth from being duped. If Chelsea's would accept reservations so seating could be done in an orderly fashion it would be different. Instead someone like Natasha it is in a position to take advantage of us. Not appreciated.
