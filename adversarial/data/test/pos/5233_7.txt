Haven't had your wonton noodle fix yet? Feel like paying 18 dollars for a bowl in the casino? How about almost 30 dollars for a plate of soy sauce chicken? Good, me either. \n\nIn Las Vegas's Chinatown brings a similar taste of home In the form of Big Wong. Any relation to the Big Wong in Manhattan? No clue but I did over hear the front desk lady speaking about food In NY. \n\nBig Wong is your take on HK style eatery. Cheap, filling and no frills. My boy and I got an order of their house special wonton noodle soup, salt and pepper chicken wings and order of ong choy ( water spinach ) made with garlic. \n\nThe wontons were fresh and the snap to the shrimp were on point. The egg noodles were a bit too springy for me and wasn't what I was used to. Broth wise, It was slightly herbaly and lacked standard wonton noodle broth taste. The chicken wings were delish but after 2, It became way too salty. Best dish to be shared. Water spinach came in fresh that day so that was a no brainer to pick. Came on a hot plate with that enticing sizzle. A must get.\n\nNot a bad place when almost 3000 miles away and need to get a quick fix of home.
