I've been trying to try this place out for so long! Something always came up and I wasn't able to go!\n\nI ordered the American Kobe with pepper jack cheese, spinach, jalapeno and aioli!  It was sooo good!!  The meat was tender and juicy! mmmm yummmy! \n\nMy boyfriend got the buffalo burger and I think I like it more than the american kobe!  It was more tasty.  \n\nFor sides we got the jalapeno friend pickles - yummmmy\nThe sweet potato fries - a must get!\nThe fried zucchini - for some reason, theirs were so good!\nAnd some onion rings - I can skip these next time\n\nI love how they have burgers for the people who don't like to build their burgers and of course having the option of building your own burgers.\n\nWhat else is cool is that you can even build your own milkshakes!! =)\n\nI think this place is pretty awesome!  Both in the menu and the food!
