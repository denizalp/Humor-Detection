80's nostalgia at its finest. :-) \n\nI live around the corner from this place, which is both super awesome and super dangerous. Why? Because it's now my favorite place in Lakewood. All the old video games I used to play as a kid are free-for-all, and the drinks and service are both awesome. They have little tables next to each game to set your drink as you relive your childhood playing things like Pole Position and Street Fighter (love!). If you're too into your game to break away to grab a drink from the bar, no worries! There's a friendly cocktail server running around with a tablet to put your next beer on your tab! Holy crap!\n\nSo basically, it's like going to the arcade when you were a teenager, only no need for quarters, there's booze, and you don't have to wait for your mom to pick you up when you're done. \n\nWell, at least I don't. You might, but then the very least you could do is invite her along you slacker.
