We were here once and had to come back the next time we visited Vegas. The food is great for $19.95 AYCE KBBQ and the service is EXCEPTIONAL. All the meats are great and the appetizers are also delicious. We like the Korean fried chicken and sesame chicken the most for the appetizers and the Kalbi and spicy pork for the meat. OZZY was our server who provided excellent service! The other servers are always timely in giving us fresh, clean grills and food always comes out fast. We love this place! :)
