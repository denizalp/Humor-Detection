I have two experiences with Jeff from A 1 Minute Key Service.  \n\nThe first was a five star experience.  He came out within 45 minutes to rekey my townhome after my short-term tenants took my keys with them.  He was done quickly and at a VERY reasonable price.\n\nThe second experience?  Oh, where do I start... \n\nWe had a lock where the key was sticking in it and we had difficulty getting it out.  We called Jeff and explained the situation.  He came out and did not change out ANY parts, just fiddled with it and got it working again.  He charged $145.95 to do that \"fiddling\"... and then said, if it stops working, then let him know and \"I will come back out and take care of it\".  That is a pretty clear statement as to him coming back out to fix it again free of charge IF his $145.95 fiddling isn't a long-term solution.\n\nWell, a couple weeks later, as you might expect, the lock began sticking just as bad as it originally had been.  We called on Jeff again and this time his tune was very different.  He said that he would be out on a Saturday.  Well, Saturday came and went.  And Jeff?  Never saw him.  Called him again and he said that he would be out on Monday.  Did he show up on Monday?  Nope.\n\nSo... we called him... again.  This time he said it would be another $200 to fix the lock, PLUS another $85 for a new cylinder!  When we brought up our prior conversations as far as him fixing what he did the first time for free, he said, \"who is this?\"  After a brief explanation of who we were, he said, \"I'm done with you!\" and hung up!  \n\nYep, that actually happened.  Be careful with this locksmith...
