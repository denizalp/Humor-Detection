When going to Jaleo, you need to remember the following things (and if some of the other reviewers had, they might have had a better experience):\n\n1. This is Vegas. Everything is overpriced. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you can accept it, move on, and enjoy yourself. Considering everything on the strip is overpriced, Jaleo really isn't that pricey.\n\n2. You're at a TAPAS restaurant. Everything is small plates. That's the point. Don't expect a huge, Hash House portion of jamón ibérico and croquetas, and you won't be disappointed. The whole idea is to order a bunch of small plates and share among friends. It's social! It's fun!\n\n3. This is a a José Andres place. Andres is into molecular gastronomy and generally screwing around with food to make it fun, playful, whimsical even. Croquetas in a shoe? Bring it on! And please, like the health department would let them use worn shoes? Come on.\n\nI went for my birthday dinner with my best friend, and it was awesome. I'll admit I have a bit of a culinary crush on José Andres, so I was preconditioned to love it, but it really was great. Loved the sangria, the croquetas were practically orgasmic, the dates were magical, and that was hands down the best damn flan I've ever had in my life. And I'm a big girl--I've had my share of flan over the years. The patatas bravas aren't traditional--they really are like thick chips--but they still taste like the real thing. \n\nNone of these things is necessarily \"revolutionary\", but they're really effing tasty.\n\nOur waitress was great, but the kitchen staff forgot about one of our dishes, so it took forever. (No matter, I'm a fan of the slow meal.) Another busser brought us someone else's croquetas by mistake, but our waitress let us have them anyway. \"Well, someone screwed up, but they're on the house, so enjoy!\" The kicker is that in my mango sorbet, I found a tiny piece of plastic that came from the container they stored it in. Lucky for Jaleo, I'm pretty hard to piss off in a restaurant. I told the waitress, she brought the manager over--the GM, not the shift manager, he explained what happened, I said it was cool (I'd also had a fair amount of that delicious sangria), then when we got the check, they'd knocked off a more than decent portion of it for all the tiny hiccups.\n\nHiccups aside, it was a great meal. I'll be back, but with more people so we can try everything on the menu. It's casual, but classy. Definitely a fan!
