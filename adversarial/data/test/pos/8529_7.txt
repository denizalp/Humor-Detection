Going to a bar and not drinking is like going to a brothel and just watching. Sure, you get the gist of what's going on, you just don't get to partake in the experience.\n\nSuch was my second and most recent experience at Dilly Dally Lounge. A few of us went here after meeting for dinner. Because I was medicated, I wasn't drinking (for a week). However, from my observation, the Dilly Dally \"Punch\" appeared to by popular in our group as well as effectively intoxicating. It combines Bacardi Rum vodka, grenadine, and Pineapple juice. Ask Robert M what other benefits this cocktail delivers, besides the obvious inebriation.\n\nThe men's room is foul, offensive and likely the source of many diseases, but what would the quintessential dive bar be otherwise?\n\nOverall, a very interesting dive bar with a colorful mix of clients. If I still lived on that side of town, I'd get into a lot of trouble here.
