Fyi: The lady L review, that person works for them! It's fake. If you are considering this company because it is cheap, I seriously recommend that you reconsider. New Planet was the first moving company I've ever used and I wish I never did... First, the company doesn't tell you about \"extra\" fees. Luckily these only ran me an extra $200, but I only had a small 600 Sq. Ft. Apartment of stuff to ship. I was moving from California to Florida and the company said they had to come on July 22nd to get my stuff there by August 3rd. Well the guy who came was 8 hours late, but he was nice enough and had a believable excuse so I chalked the tardiness up to the distance he had to travel. But then everything gets worse after that. They tell you a window of delivery but it's complete bs. It's now August 7th and I don't have anything. They take your stuff to Nevada and just hold it there for weeks! The last thing we heard we had a new delivery window of August 10th through the 12th. Then they called us today saying there's been \"another snag\" and they will get back to us on Monday... Not even another delivery date given. They have until August the 20th before they breach the contact and I will be calling the police to get my belongings back. DO NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY!
