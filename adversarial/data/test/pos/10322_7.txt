The Pretty Kitty has by far been the best place I have been to in Las Vegas to get your personal waxing taken care of. I came across the place just driving by on Flamingo and their sign outside the salon caught my eye. They really do get you in and out within 15 minutes! Such a plus considering all the other salons take so much longer and they are really accomodating to walk-ins. The Pretty Kitty does a better job than any other salon and have the friendliest staff. Complete experts on the subject and awesome atmosphere!
