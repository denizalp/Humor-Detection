After a spontaneous weeknight dinner at Pomo recently, my family of four happened upon Luna Gelateria for a little something sweet... \n\nOne sample taste and we were sold... well, actually it was several samples before we decided on a strawberry cone and a lemon cone to share, but every single bite we took was better than the next.  And as if the selection of gelato (old style and new) isn't enough, Luna houses a continuous chocolate fountain to boot...   This place has only been officially open for a few days, but it was love at first bite for all of us.\n\nLuna popped up seemingly overnight in the space formerly known as Forno Fabbri.  It has the same owners (perhaps a new partner?), same modern decor, and casual \/ comfortable vibe as it did previously, but instead of a full on market and cafe, you'll find that the menu is more limited and specialized... fresh croissants, pastries and coffee are all still available, as well as some grocery items, but the main focus now is... you guessed it... GELATO!\n\nWhether you go for the old school gelato or the \"new era\" gelato that is made from local ingredients and spins to life in front of you with machinery imported from Italy, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nIf you're looking for an authentic taste of Italian gelato, look no further than Luna!  Can't wait to return again very soon!
