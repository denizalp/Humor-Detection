I came here with my family and friend who was visiting us from out of town. I ordered two orders of snow crab California rolls and grilled salmon. I was wondering what all the hype was so here's my final verdict. \n\nCustomer service was ok. We had people coming by non stop offering my friend more hot tea that he had ordered. It was in fact, quiet annoying because I think in the less than hour ish visit, servers came by around 8 times to check on us and offered green tea refills... for ummm, just for my friend. I didn't need any water so I never asked for a refill. They came by to refill water once, so kudos for remembering us water drinkers. Then they probably come by 3 additional times to check to see if we were OK again. Gee, I didn't need to be checked on us every 3 minutes. \n\nIt's 4am in the morning and I can't sleep. I'm thirsty and my tongue feels really nasty. I also had to apply ChapStick. Why? I think what I ate had a TON of msg!!! \n\nI live in Vegas and I frequent a lot of AYCE sushi buffets but knowing that I didn't have AYCE at Soho, why do I feel so thirsty right now like I had eaten at a buffet? It's not fair cuz I only had two snow crab California rolls and a grilled salmon mini plate. \n\nI just wanted to warn anyone who only eat cooked meat to be careful. You're going to feel thirsty. I'm just glad my 22 months old daughter refused to eat any of the food here because it wouldn't have been nice if she wants the one up right now lol. And if you're planning to bring your children to eat here, think twice. Your kids might wake-up at night crying for water.
