I recently worked an event here booked by my company. The Valet, bellman and information desk were extremely welcoming and helpful! My 2 star review is based on the lack of courteous and timely assistance in setting the ballroom we had rented.  There were a few tweaks and adjustments that needed to be made in a timely fashion and instead of offering speedy assistance I was met with a question for every question I had and an attitude.  I had been passed through 3 different people before speaking with someone who I was to believe was the one to help, and when every question I had was answered with a question I was not happy and was frustrated. I was made to feel like a burden rather then a paying guest.
