After viewing their Instagram page and reading all of the reviews, I had SUPER high hopes for Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken. With my mom visiting, we trekked all the way down to the Strip specifically so I could try the \"State Fair\"- a fried chicken sandwich with a funnel cake on it!! When i saw it on IG, I knew that I HAD to have one- I'm a huge fan of sweet and savory combinations.\n\nBlue Ribbon is kind of the chicken version of In and Out. Order at the counter, they call your name when it's ready, and there's a small seating area inside and outside. One really nice touch is the ice water already ready for you in plastic cups. \n\nThe woman who took our order was friendly and helpful, so we started off on the right foot. But it took FOREVER for our orders to be ready. I knew it would take some time, but it was really quite awhile. When our orders finally arrived, there was a bit of a mixup and the counter people had to scramble to remedy it (basically they put the wrong sides with the wrong chicken).\n\nOk, most importantly- the food!\n\nState Fair- the chicken itself was great. Hot, juicy, tender, well seasoned. The bread was also great. But the funnel cake added absolutely nothing to the sandwich. It needed powdered sugar, or maple syrup or something to get the sweet going with the savory. I ended up having to add honey to it to get what I wanted from it. \n\nSmoked Mac and Cheese- pretty good! Very cheesy, noodles were well cooked. Could have used a bit more seasoning. \n\nLoaded Fries- meh. We had to ask for a side of sour cream. It was supposed to come with it, but there was barely any on there.\n\nMy boyfriend didn't enjoy his Cheesy Chicken Sandwich that much, he said the chicken wasn't seasoned enough for him. Also, he ordered his sandwich with applewood smoked bacon,  and it came with bacon bits on it- which no one informed us that's how they do it. He was pretty annoyed about that! Bacon bits on a sandwich?? \n\nAll in all, it was fine, and filling, but not really worth a trip down to the Strip just for it. The hunt continues!
