This rating is based on customer service only.\n\nI have read great reviews about this place so I am considering trying it out. I called just for some general information hours, prices, etc... The girl that I spoke with was very short when it came to answering my questions. When I was done I said \"Thank you\" and all I got was a click. How rude can someone be? If she doesn't like her job she should leave. I'm sure there are plenty of people that would appreciate working and do it with a better attitude. \n\nIF I decide to go I will update my review based on service, food, and the experience.
