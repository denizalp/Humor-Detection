This sounds like you want to show the world you fixed the problem but it's the first I've heard of any fix. Just to set the record straight you didn't offer to pay for cleaning carpet until you had a public forum to do it. Regardless of the color of your cleaners your team did stain the carpet. They dropped a bucket of what I assumed was cleaning supplies. It's very clear in the cameras. And most of your other facts are wrong as well. There were no moving blankets in the closet. They were in the dining room. The closet wasn't supposed to be touched. The \"piles\" we're sorted for goodwill. But it was one big walked on pile when I got back. There is no carpet in there. It's tile so I'm not sure what you were trying to vacuum. I would understand if they couldn't figure out how to turn off the bedroom light because it's on a remote. But is that why every light in the house was left on? And my toothbrush was in a basket of things. The basket needed to be moved to clean. Not the toothbrush. Do you like people touching your toothbrush? And maybe I can understand bath mats not getting put back correctly but it doesn't take a genius to know the waste paper basket next to the toilet can cause an inconvenience if left in the adjacent closet. There were a few dishes in the sink. I appreciate you washing them. Too bad one was broken and hidden in the back of a cupboard. And why were things moved from one cabinet to another that weren't even cleaned? Why was a nicknack from the counter shoved behind cereal boxes in a cabinet? Hard to figure out why so many things were moved when so few needed washing. But overall ... I love the part about how if I would have asked you not to have all 5 women walk on my bedroom carpet you would have had them wear booties. Have you possibly considered that a given?! When someone hires you to clean their house it should be understood you don't dirty one part while cleaning another. You did call me that night. And you said sorry. But you didn't offer any solutions. Your reply was obviously designed to make excuses and create the illusion of solving the problem. If you want to fix it the carpet cleaning was $150 and the broken bowl was $17. Send me a check. But don't think making excuses online will fix anything. And don't forget to mention how you were going to talk to your crew and get back to me but never did ... Unless you count your yelp comment as getting back to me.
