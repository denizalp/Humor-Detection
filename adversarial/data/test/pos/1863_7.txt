WAY THE HELL TOO LOUD - it's a place to drink and eat - not a place to socialize with colleagues! I suppose if you are from the area and this is your spot - I can see the love for it. \n\nI tried the wings and coming from Buffalo - I will tell you - these wings are really GOOD!\n\nThe place isn't the cleanest, but you have to think - BAR!
