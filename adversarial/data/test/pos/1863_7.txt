Feedback on car care businesses are always so polarizing. As someone who manages a fleet of about 20 vehicles, I can tell you this from experience: If you had a negative visit, it happens. If you had an outstanding\/amazing visit, it's not going to be that way every time. This goes for every service center, not just Firestone. What separates the good ones from the bad is typically the leadership of the store and their staff.\n\nThis Firestone is where I go to get my company vehicle serviced for tires. I've got a list of 4-5 companies I can go to but Firestone seems to be the best in the area. Much better than a dealership experience. It's easy to set up appointments over the phone and for the most part communicate what you need done or what tires you want ordered. From time to time I'll call them for a tire rotation as the store is only a mile away from my office.\n\nTrust me, if you're looking for a car care center that does everything perfectly every single time, you're going to have a bad time. There's just too many variables in this business to expect perfection. That being said, the guys here are great at what they do. When I order tires I get an accurate estimate on their arrival. I typically drop my car off in the morning and have someone bring me back in the afternoon.\n\nWhile there have been a couple mishaps with service times and waiting periods, it's nothing a little bit of patience would remedy. Overall I think Firestone is a notch above most service centers in the area. Definitely better than most dealerships!\n\nSuper bonus addition: It's funny as I had this written as a draft, yesterday they told me that my right-front tire was super bald and needed to be replaced ASAP. Today it blew out a mere 1\/4 mile away from home! The girl who was talking to me had actually said she was surprised it hadn't blown out yet. This is a huge oversight by my on-site maintenance company (and partially myself as well) but it's just funny how Firestone hit the nail on the head. New tires ordered, spare put on until Monday, and kudos to Firestone, hah!
