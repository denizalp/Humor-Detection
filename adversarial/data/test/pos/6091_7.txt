HANDS DOWN THE WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD IN VEGAS!!!!!\n\nMy friends and I got in Friday night to the Cosmopolitan.  We were pretty excited because the Cosmo is a fancy hotel and we had heard their night club was fun.\nWe went to Marquee for a couple hours and then decided to go gamble.  I left my friends so I could go use the restroom.  Well you know how you can easily get turned around in a casino.  I was wondering around by myself for a hot minute trying to find my friends.  A security agent approached me asking to see my ID.  Not a problem at all.  I gave it to him and made a joke about how he made my night because I'm 30.  He completely ignores me and starts saying my name into his radio.  Thinking that he'd only wanted to see my ID to verify age, I asked him what was going on.  He held up his hand and shushed me.  Well I'm sorry but I'm a grown women staying at your hotel and you've taken my ID and aren't giving me any details.  This has now upset me.  I ask him again what's going on and he continues to talk into his radio.  I tell him I want my id back and he tells me I need to calm down.   Still not explaining to me what's going on.  I told him I was staying at hotel and he asked my room number.  I left one number off on accident and he tells me I'm lying bc that's not even a room there.  He then tells me I have to leave.  He walks my outside and tells me to leave.  Well at this point I'm a little frantic because my friends are inside and I'm being kicked out of the hotel FOR NO REASON!!!!  I come straight back inside and so they call metro police on me.  A gang unit.  Yes a single female staying at Cosmo with some friends had a gang unit called on her FOR NO REASON!  I'm being argued with and held and still no one is telling me what I have done wrong.  Finally the shift manager from security comes and pulls me aside and speaks to me in much more respectful manor.  He explains it's protocol to stop people that might be part of \"suspicious activity\".  Yes, that's right I was being confused for an escort.  I paid for an expensive room at The Cosmopolitan only to be held for 15 minutes because I could possibly be taking part in suspicious activity as I walk around lost looking for my friends.  Well needless to say I am beyond upset at this point.  They finally check to see that my name is in their system as being a guest.  Couldn't they have done that within first 5 minutes and avoided all this?  Avoided offending and embarrassing me in front  people in the casino watching the whole debacle take place!  I get to leave finally and return to my friends.  The next day we go straight to the security office to file a complaint.  We thought for sure the Cosmopolitan would be very apologetic and quite frankly embarrassed that their security treated a guest this way.  Not at all!  I barely got an apology.  I was informed I can email risk management and that could take up to two weeks to hear back.  We then decided to go to guest services.  Surely someone on their staff is going to want to rectify this situation.  Surely The Cosmopolitan isn't ok with treating guest this way.  Haha wow was I wrong.  The senior manager at guest services was condescending and rude.  He implied that it was my fault.  Saying that \"metro police had a negative experience with me.\"  Ya think?  You held me without reason for 15 minutes in the assumption I was an escort!  Most people would be livid!  I spoke with 4 different departments at the Cosmopolitan and no one was helpful.   It seems this is standard for them.  Unless you want to risk being harassed by security, I would stay far far away from The Cosmopolitan.  There are plenty of wonderful hotels on the strip that treat their guest with respect.  \nMy friends and I will not be returning!
