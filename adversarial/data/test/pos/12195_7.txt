Outrageous prices. Save your time and money - you will not be happy. Cantankerous repairman never showed when he was supposed to - rescheduled for another day and came late. When he did finally arrive, didn't have the supplies he needed to make the repair so had to return for a second time. On this trip, he asked me to go get additional parts myself so he wouldn't have to return (ill-prepared) again. Wrote a letter to the office and never even heard a response. Over $400 for a repair that was half-baked and never fully completed.
