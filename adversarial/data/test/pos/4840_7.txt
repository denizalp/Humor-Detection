If you aren't wearing toms, skinny jeans, and those large hipster glasses, do yourself a favor and don't come here.  And that applies to the guys as well as the girls.\n\nOlder (30ish) crowd, pricey beers, RUDE staff, bartenders who don't know the beer, gross bathroom, massive amounts of hipster\/hippie pretension.  When the door guy is mean to you because you smiled... you know you're in the wrong place.  I've heard the happy hour is good, but I will never try it.\n\nYes it's free of college kids, but when the alternative to that is a bunch of older judgmental people trying to be scene, I'd rather hit up Great Dane or one of the other places with a friendlier crowd and better beer specials.  Try King & Mane.
