Today, I came for dinner with two others. When I walked in, no one attended to me or offered to seat me. Only when another party entered and asked me if I had been attended to first did the server offer to seat me. After being seated, I heard another table ask where their water is and why is no one asking for their orders. I noticed many waiters just standing around the register....\n\nWhen we finally got to order, the waiter asked us if we wanted anything to drink, so we said hot tea. The waiter failed to tell us that tea was extra charge and came in single mugs instead of a tea pot. Is that not cheating customers out of their money or what?\n\nTraditionally, Korean restaurants come with free side dishes, and our waiter did not bother to give us the side dishes until I had to personally ask.\n\nI ordered the bulgogi, and the only redeeming factor is that it came with purple rice. The price of the dish is incredibly high for the quality and the over marinated sweetness of the meat.\n\nWhile I wouldn't recommend anyone who is not from Pittsburgh to go to Green Pepper and would highly suggest going to your own local Korean place back home instead, Green Pepper is easily one of the more accessible Korean restaurants you can get to in Pittsburgh.... If you do choose to visit Green Pepper, I would be mindful that the service will not be good if not terrible and the price will be high, but the food will be decent.
