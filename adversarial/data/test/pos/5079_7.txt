Stayed here last month in a beautiful suite upon arrival to Las Vegas for an extended visit. We were upgraded because of Scott's Marriott status, and were very pleased with the one bedroom one and one-half bath suite with a large balcony offering beautiful views, and a place to relax with a beverage. \n\nThe property has always been one of my favorites in town: lush tropical landscaping, waterfalls, and beautiful pools and Spa all added to our comfort. Only the gym was lacking, but both of mine are five minutes away, so no worries. Dining options are not great, but we had reservations elsewhere, Tivoli is close for shopping and some better restaurants, Downtown Summerlin and many other restaurants are also just a few moments away. \n\nThe Circle Bar had some live music a couple of nights, and friendly bartenders. I was actually sad to switch hotels, and we will definitely return during future visits.\n\n* large suite with large balcony  *\n\n** large marble bath with oversized jacuzzi tub **\n\n*** no Club Level amenities found in other JW\/Marriott properties ***\n\n**** quiet rooms ****
