Really solid LAN cafe. The software\/hardware is great, chairs are comfortable, plus the overall vibe is fairly chill. It is non-smoking compared to Gorilla Cafe (thank god) and the computer set up is nice for playing multi-player\/with friends. Best LAN center in Vegas imo. There is a Thai restaurant connected next door and they'll bring your food to your station. Nice spot to enjoy a few hours of fun. \n\nAdded bonus, their night owl special ($10 from 2am-10am) is a killer deal.
