I haven't been to a Zoo since I moved from Singapore to Canada 8 years ago. The excitement was real. I wanted to to go the zoo more than I wanted to see the CN Tower.\n\nWe planned a whole day to visit the entire thing but suprisingly it only took about 5-6 hours including eating time. We got there as early as we could to opening time and honestly that makes a difference. There are less people in the morning so you can relax. We were Lucky and visited on a day that wasn't too sunny,  not too warm, and it only rained at the end of our visit.\n\nI think they did a great job with the exhibits, the variety of animals, the number of activities, the clarity of their map\/signs\/trails, and overall structure. \n\nIt's a gigantic zoo that offers so much! I loved my time here. They had so many amazing things to see and explore! I got to see sloths, pandas, sugar gliders, blue frogs, and so much more I can't even name them all! They have this awesome section dedicated to Canadian animals too which I really think is Worth the extra walking distance (It's the furthest exhibit on the map).\n\nI visited with my boyfriend on Canada Day and they were having even more activities than normal. (Face paint, extra information booths, stickers, bracelets).\n\nThis is one of the best Zoo's I've ever been to. \n\nIf you're planning a visit, here are my tips:\n-You're allowed to bring snacks\n-Bring a water bottle, although they don't have any refilling stations the staff of the restaurants will be more than happy to fill it up for you.\n-If you see something you like at a gift store that is specific to an exhibit, buy it now. it won't be at the final gift store. (Panda merchandise is sold at the Panda store and they have more merchandise at the actual Panda Store)\n-Wear good walking shoes and a breathable outfit (There isn't a lot of places with shade so on days where it's really sunny, the heat is killer)\n-Arrive at opening time or as close to opening time as you can\n-Visit the panda's first! Once the flood of people arrive the waiting times get insane!\n\n\nVisited on July 1st 2017
