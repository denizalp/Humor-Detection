I've never written a review so damn fast...first off the post office is the post office...it's going to suck a whole lot of the time...I get it. Aside from this place from having that old beat up interior decor...here's what happens just now:\n\nHusband and I went in to send a return package to Cox. The box was ready to go with the exception of tape. Idk who this \"customer service attendant\" is that runs the floor while you're waiting in that long \n@$$ line but she approached us and lectured us on the collapsible box package...she said with a snicker, \"You can't send it like that you have to tape.\" The first time my husband said, \"oh ok, it's ok I'll get the tape.\"  BUT forcefully repeated it 6 times! As if she was pissed off and lecturing her 9 year old kid! WTF?!? I interjected before my husband blew his top and said, \"OK that's fine lady we'll know next time. I want to leave NOW! I'm not going to be disrespected for no damn reason.  She is fu€king ridiculous rude. \" \n\nSo ummm maybe regulations have changed and you have to wrap your packages before you approach the counter.  Lady...whoever you are....learn the CORRECT way to approach someone! you're better off saying, \"Oh, you just need to wrap it with tape before we send it off.\" And left it at that!....My husband and I are grown @$$ people. We will buy some fu€king tape here and wrap that bit€h up no fu€king problem!!!...I don't need anyone lecturing me on how to package. \n\nApparently you all DO NOT inspect your packages like you USED TO (at least they do in San Diego)...so USPS security must be $hit since all those budget cuts. Hmm...Beware consumers!...USPS apparently hire people who lack common sense and social interpersonal skills...idgaf if I'm sending one single chicklet...I'd rather deal with UPS.
