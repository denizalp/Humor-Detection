Okay, I need to preface this review with a confession.  I am a total rookie when it comes to deli's.  I didn't know what to order and when the waitress was finally looking at me for my order, I panicked and got a burger.  Needless to say, I was given a hard time.  I knew that I was going against the grain when everyone else was ordering matza ball  soup and pastrami sandwiches.  But, to my defense, they had a burger on the menu, so I can only take half the responsibility.\n\nThe burger was okay, and knew I made a mistake as I was getting jealous of the soup.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will get the soup.  \n\nService was alright and there wasn't an empty table in the place.  So, that speaks volumes.
