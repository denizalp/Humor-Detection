Being as my friends and I frequent this spot on a weekly basis, I'd say it's one of my favorite places to be in Arizona.  With the outdoor sand volleyball courts, ping pong tables, horseshoes, bags, live music, and grill where you can cook your own food, it's a great place for friends to gather and have a great time.  Plus the beer is cheep and they have a good selection.  ;)
