Woo hoo, a new Publix! This one is still as good as any of the others I have shopped and includes the usual super deli, great produce and excellent meat areas. The butcher very helpfully offered to cut anything that I would like if they didn't have enough of what I needed today.\n\nMuch like the Publix on South Blvd, they were very pressed for space so the store is complete with its own parking garage at street level and basement level, with stairs to street level if you want or an elevator that is large enough for full shopping carts.\n\nWide aisles, bright lights, lots of carts with working wheels. Helpful, smiling staff, of course.\n\nDirectly opposite the Cotswold Harris Teeter, I think the people in this neighborhood are going to see some good competition here. This will be an exciting rivalry and the consumers will benefit.\n\nIt is a little hard to access when heading towards Sharon Amity. Just drive past the store and make the left on Sharon Amity and then left again on Colwick.
