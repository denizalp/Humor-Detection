Really tasty Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese dishes with huge portions! We ordered shumai dumplings, Tom kha gai, shrimp panang, and chicken pad Thai. It way too much food for two people but we wanted to try a few dishes and will definitely have leftovers for a few more meals! I do wish the side of rice was a bit bigger though. There was only enough rice for maybe a third of the curry. I also thought the Thai spice level was a bit off. The Tom kha (level 3) was spicier than the pad Thai (level 5). \n\nIt took about 10-15 minutes for us to be greeted once we sat down but after that the service was on point. It wasn't the best Thai or Chinese food I've had but I would definitely come back next time I get the craving.
