Avoid!!! Lousy customer service. Brought my car in at 7:45am 15 minutes before they opened and was 8th in line to bolt on the winters. They said it was cued first come first serve. Came back 3 hours later and my keys were still sitting on the counter, the old man with the mustache and Jason give each other a confused look and promptly picked up my keys and said \"you're next\"...no apology whatsoever. I waited outside and it took 1 hour for them to finish...Jason comes over to me with a broken center hub off my Audi rim and said \"what a cheap part\" and suggests I krazy glue it back together. Again no apology and no offer of compensation for his shops incompetence. Do not support this sorry excuse of a shop.
