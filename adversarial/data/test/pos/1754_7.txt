I write this review because this Winchell's blows my mind away. I see it every time we drive \"Narth\" to the zoo, drive-ins and Texas Station. And I want to post this business again with it's actual title instead of the one provided under this address.\n\nThis location is a combo business. But this one is Winchell's Doughnuts AND SUBWAY sandwiches! That's right!\n\nJared, \"eat healthy\" Subway sandwiches paired up with a doughnut shop. I think it's hilarious! I think it's brilliant! I have no idea how this happened. I have no idea what the pitchmen said in pairing these 2. It's the only combo location like this in town. There is another odd combo, A&W root beer and Long John silvers that has a couple of locations I've seen. But this combo seems to flat out contradict itself for anyone going to Subway for a healthy lunch. \n\nIt's also a testimony to anyone who goes here and does NOT order off the doughnut menu. What motivation, what self control they have! And yet business-wise it's shooting itself in the foot? Or doesn't it, if it caters to both sides of the health food vs. treat yourself debates? \n\nAnd while Winchell's isn't \"health\" food, it's not outright hard core junk food to what's out there. It's still a fresh, perishable food. you leave it in the box on the counter for a few days, it turns rock hard and expires at some point in the week. Kids can have a diet of sour candies and Mountain Dews and all those \"baked goods\" machine wrapped for the convenience store that have the 40 preservative chemical contents to make their shelf life to the next decade.\n\nI love Winchell's. I love subway. and I can't wrap my mind around getting both at the same time, until now...\n\nBMT and some twisties please. No, I've GOT to eat this here... Now, coffee or soda...?
