Extremely rude, arrogant and unprofessional behavior of S & Sons Moving during my sister's recent move. They broke TV stand by putting it on the cart and pilling other heavy items on it. No apology and even a comment \"it was lose before\". After asking if they will finish in agreed time or we should extend the elevator, the main guy started yelling and said \"I can leave all your things in front of the building if you want\".\nOverall, very unpleasant and pathetic behavior of employees of the company that \"claims to be on the top of the moving industry\". It absolutely doesn't show.
