I have never BEEN to Central Phoenix Animal Hospital, but I have called them MANY times for kitty emergency questions, and even though they didn't know my name, or my cats, or get one dime from me, they always were extremely nice and beyond patient.  \n\nNow I have a puppy, and his previous owner took him here for his shots.  I've once again had to call them for questions regarding the shots and Puck's health and needs, and again, they've been nice as could be.\n\nWhen it's time for his next checkup (and my cats) there is no way I'll take them anywhere else.  Because who's a precious baby?  Who is?  My wittle sweet babies are!  Yes they are!  Yes they ARE precious babies!
