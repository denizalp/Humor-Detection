Hello Jessica.  I would like to apologize in advance for the sarcasm with which I will reply to your comments. Since you were not in the exam room with me nor were you even in the building when any of this occurred and you have chosen to comment on matters you have absolutely no knowledge of, you have, unfortunately, put yourself in this position.  Please allow me to begin by stating there was no exaggeration of anything.  Had you been in the exam room during my exam, you would have witnessed THE FACT that the Dr. didn't \"answer all questions presented\", since I had no questions whatsoever. It was not until my exam was OVER that I asked if she was going to check for my reading prescription. It was not until that moment that she put those funny looking glasses on me and gave my a card to read.  You also stated that doing a \"trial frame\" is uncommonly done. I believe you are mistaken since that is the way to test for reading close up and which is why it is part of a ROUTINE EXAM. I have nothing derogatory to say about the Dr.only that the exam was a bit rushed and not as thorough,....which is simply A FACT AND NOT AN EXAGGERATION. In addition, you stated the Dr. mentioned my difficulties with getting glasses in the past. Maybe the FACT that my exam was rushed is probably why the Dr. misunderstood. This would have been my first pair of prescription glasses.  I had a previous prescription from last year and just needed an updated exam....but have never had prescription glasses. Again, FACT AND NOT EXAGGERATION.  Next, you failed to address or acknowledge the FILTH in your display area so I will assume you wanted to avoid the subject altogether. The reality is your displays were FILTHY....period. For you to say it was not to my standards is calling the rest of your customers dirty pigs, since only a dirty pig would enjoy and compliment those DISGUSTING DISPLAYS.  You also mentioned the optician heard of my preference and pulled some glasses from the back to show me.  THAT IS A BLATANT LIE, since the only preference I stated was to see the entire display. I guess you feel I should have been happy sitting there hours while your optician DECIDED WHICH GLASSES TO SHOW ME, as if I had nothing else to do.  Maybe you should keep your entire display in the back and only bring out a few at a time for each customer.  Maybe then you will realize how ridiculous that is rather than continue to state \"BUT THAT WAS NOT TO YOUR SATISFACTION\".  What a stupid thing for you to say.  As far as patient privacy and denying me access to the glasses.....I simply do not believe you.  Your staff was adamant about refusing any kind of access and made ZERO EFFORT to even attempt to bring out the display. I am sure, had they wanted to help me, they would have tried to figure out a way to do so. I can only imagine the disaster in that back area.  If your displays for the public were that FILTHY I can only imagine how many \"other health code violations\" are kept in the back...and, by the way, there is no patient privacy....your front office person calls the insurance and communicates what appears to be  privileged medical information for the entire waiting room to hear so you might want to check that too, since you say I have given you much to discuss. The bottom line is that YOUR STAFF IS RUDE and there are a few other reviews suggesting the same. What happened to me should not have happened and you have done absolutely nothing to acknowledge the manner in which I was treated.  YOUR STAFF HAS LIED ABOUT THE FACTS AS THEY OCCURRED. No worries though....as you probably know I have awesome vision insurance so, in the end, your office lost out. I am sure the owner doesn't care to see money walking out the door as a result of something so trivial and completely avoidable. I am glad you called the insurance for a new display....I doubt, however, anyone will ever see those glasses that \"I was entitled to\"....your optician FAILED TO MENTION THEM OR OFFER THEM AS AN OPTION ON MY ORIGINAL VISIT so I can only imagine it is just part of what appeared to me as fraudulent practices.  PLEASE DON'T EVER CALL ME FOR ANYTHING....SINCE I WILL NEVER GIVE MY BUSINESS TO VISION WELLNESS.
