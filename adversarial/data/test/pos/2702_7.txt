Second trip to Bacaro.\n\nPrix fixe dinner for two with the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu.\n\n$145\n\nWe left hungry, and shaking our heads.\n\nWalked across the street to Esquire and had dinner again.\n\nWhen McDonalds could have profitably sold me 145 hot hamburgers, don't let me actually leave hungry.
