Really good tapas, a really nice mix of classic southern and modern fare. The dishes are cooked and served immediately so everything is piping hot and each has a secret sauce that the dishes are smothered in. Green peppers are one that I'm still craving today. Same with falafel. Fish was incredible and peach cobbler with blueberry ice cream is something everyone should try. \n\nOnly negative is that it's so popular! There was a 45 minute table wait on a Tuesday at 6 pm so we sat at the bar and it gets noisy there because that's also where all food is prepared. They may need more staff too, but they are on point with dishes.
