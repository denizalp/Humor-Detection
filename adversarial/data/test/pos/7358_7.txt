We waited for about 45mins to get in (two people, Saturday afternoon around 11). The wait time was the only ridiculous part of the experience to be honest, but I had read reviews before visiting so I was expecting a wait time of around 20mins. The food however was pretty great and presentation was lovely. I had a server named Alex and he honestly was amazing. Very fast service (especially considering how busy it was), and I saw him also bussing tables whenever he had an extra second. Many servers would take that little minute they have to check their phone but he was very hard working, so major props to him. It's because of servers like him, it makes the experience so great!\nOverall, I would say the restaurant should think of ways to keep the restaurant flowing faster so people aren't waiting an hour outside for food.
