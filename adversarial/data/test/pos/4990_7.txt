Don't waste your time with this business. Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had in any business I have visited, ever. I walked in for the first time excited to give them my business and walked out a few minutes later feeling utterly insulted and belittled. Even McDonald's and wal mart have a leg up on this place when it comes to service.\n\nThanks for the response but that is just plain inaccurate Mr. Z. I also find it strange another shop was able to do the work needed without extra material. Accountability and honesty are clearly not important to you.
