This park is a work in progress, I'm a little worried about what it will look like after a heavy rain. A large, beautiful grassy area is situated down next to the drainage channel, tons of trash and mud have accumulated at the mouth of the drainage tunnel, it looks and smells gross.\nBut I like the look of the natural bluffs and rock outcrops around the edge of the grass field. The rest of the park we saw was clean and looked nice.\nThe parking lot off of Decatur is the spot you'll find the dog runs and children play area with splash pads. There are 3 separate dog areas, they are not very big and have low fencing, so dogs that like to jump may be able to escape. The trees are new and small so there wasn't a lot of shady areas. Water fountains and poo bag dispensers are installed around the park. \nI will likely visit again since there are so few dog parks on the SW side of town.
