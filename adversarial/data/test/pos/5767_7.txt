I really want this place to be good.  I spoke at great length with the owner and I truly feel that this family has the best of intentions.  It's heartwarming to hear about a family putting their son through college to become a chef.  I've been here twice and can tell you that I won't be back unless significant changes happen.\n\nIt all started off wrong.  My girlfriend and I walked in to see a mostly empty restaurant.  There was a large table with 13 seats that had a party of about 6 sitting and eating.  We told the hostess that there were only 2 of us, and she seemed annoyed.  She asked if we had reservations, which we didn't and her response was, \"well I don't think we have any availability.\"  Odd seeing how the place was mostly empty.  Luckily, a couple was just leaving the bar and we were able to grab a seat.  \n\nFor being a Peruvian restaurant, they don't have a single Peruvian beer available.\n\nThe food is okay, but the rice wasn't cooked enough and was crunchy.  The ceviche was perfect and had the perfect amount of spice.  The leche de tigre was delicious.  \n\nI asked for a glass of water and was given one fast enough.  However, while sipping I noticed a sharpness on my lips.  When I examined my cup, I noticed a large chip missing from the edge of my glass.  I notified the waitress and she was barely interested.  Not enough to replace it immediately.  Odd seeing how this is a HUGE health risk.  Chips like this are caused by laziness in the wait staff who scoop ice from the ice bin using their customers glass.  Guess what?  That chip is now somewhere in the ice bin.  The entire rest of the night, I couldn't help but think of someone swallowing shards of glass.  \n\n While sitting at the bar, I couldn't focus on anything other than the activity in the kitchen: the entire wait staff and cook staff were horsing around playing.  It wasn't a single instance I saw, it was for the entire duration of my meal.  It was incredibly unprofessional and distracting.  Maybe the cook was too busy playing grab ass with his friends to cook rice acceptably.  \n\nI truly hope the owner sees this review and cleans house.  The girls behind the the bar are inattentive and don't care about the heritage of the food they're serving.  Moreover, the owners son needs to get serious about his trade.  El Chullo really has an opportunity to clinch the Peruvian food market in all of Phoenix.  For now, I'll be going to Villa Peru
