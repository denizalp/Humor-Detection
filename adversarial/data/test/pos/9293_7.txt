Okay, living within a few miles of this place it is convenient if you are trying to get a quick drink or just take a friend from out of town in to blow some money... The Place itself is not bad looking and the buffet is Ehh... There are a few ups and a few downs.\n\nUps:\n1. The the south point member club sends out $15-50 In free slot play about once a month.\n2. The oyster bar has a good deal on King Crab legs.\n3. The Bowling ally is awesome and is 24 hours\n\nDowns:\n1. Walking into this place is like walking into a 12x12 room full of marlboro testers on full puff status... Plan on having second hand cancer when you leave and plan on having a soar throat for a few days after leaving.\n2. I understand that coctail waitresses are assigned the uniforms... So come on South Point, is it really fair for those poor girls to be forced to have a 3 inch thick piece of cloth pulled up there ass and the sides cut up to thier arm puts.... All i can say is this is not flattering. \"if you are a c octail waitress there please understand I am not talking about your lack of appeal, but the wrestling singlets that you are forced to wear just dont do any favors\"\n3. The slots, in my opinion are very very tight, they boast the %97 payback rate on video poker but that means nothing to me. Thats a %97 payback rate based on an infinate amount of time.\n\nMaybe i am being a little harsh on the place, and i know my main complaint is the smoke.. And I have had 2 bad experiences at the buffet, not directly but watching managers discipline the employees by screaming at them in the middle of the dining area is not exceptable and I personally feel that type of behavior reflects upon the entire establishment.\n\nSo if you choose to go to the South Point, Go for a movie, maybe a few games of bowling, and a drink.
