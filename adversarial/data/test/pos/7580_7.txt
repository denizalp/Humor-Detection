II started with a 4 star rating, but as I listed the attributes of Ocotillo, it has to be five, even for a first visit. The soundtrack was the clincher. This place has it all:\n\nThoughtful and well-executed menu\nFocus is on integration of vegetables. I went with the roasted cauliflower as a starter. It's quite different and really good. My salmon main was very nice too with equal parts salad and salmon along with just enough starch. The smoked beet and chevre salad is exceptional.\n\nAttentive service\nIts the little things that count. Instead of leaving me with my fork and knife from my appetizer, both were removed and replaced with new for my main. I like it best when I'm well informed and visited, but not overly so. Ocotillo does this.\n\nIncredible layout\nThere are multiple sections to Ocotillo. My dining partner said it reminded of a W Hotel. There is an outdoor area with fireplace, lawn and casual seating. I'd describe the inside as upscale industrial. One inside area is more secluded, the other is high--top seating with an open view of the kitchen - yes.\n\nVibe\nEfficient. Effective and Relaxed. Combining these attributes is no small feet. It takes thoughtful planning and solid execution. Well done Ocotillo.\n\nSoundtrack\nNow for the kicker. In 2008 I was cloistered at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo for 36 hours. Jet lagged and depressed, I listened to a continuous loop of electronica \/ eclectic from a hotel channel. When I say continuous loop, I mean for 36 hours. After I left I could not get this soundtrack out of my head - so killer. The only song I knew was Heroine by Blonde Redhead https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zVMF6gYbGEE. I even contacted the hotel afterward, but they only spoke Japanese so that was useless. This was years ago. The soundtrack at Ocotillo came as close as anything I've heard since. I id'd a bunch of the songs. Very happy about this.
