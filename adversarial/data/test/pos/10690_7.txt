This place is nostalgic for me because they were all over when I was growing up in LA. Located on the second floor of the Galleria, this is the only one in Vegas. The store is small and clean with everything separated by categories. All your chocolate is in one section, all the gummy is in another, etc. Yes, the candy is overpriced and you can find most of it cheaper at grocery stores, but it's all about the experience;  bagging your own candy and mixing it all in one bag. My favorites are definitely the sour green apple gummies and white chocolate covered  pretzels. I've been here a few times and the employees I've came across have been friendly. I will definitely be back when I visit the Galleria again.
