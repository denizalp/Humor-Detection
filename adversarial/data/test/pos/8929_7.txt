09\/09\/10\n\n2.5 stars!\n\nI'd acquired a gift card, so we decided to have an early dinner here before catching a show at AMC.  I asked if complimentary bread was available.  The server said it was, and would we like some olives w\/ it?  \"Sure!,\" we chimed.  Rosemary focaccia w\/ olives tasted wonderful, although the olives were, naturally, very salty.  Were we told that the olives would cost extra, we probably would've passed on the suggestion (since my Mom isn't gaga over olives due to their saltiness).  I'd recently added eggplant to my diet, so I was on an eggplant kick.  We therefore had to try the eggplant parmigiana, which came w\/ capellini pasta and a side salad.  I also wanted to try their spinach salad w\/ blue cheese.  I don't know, but whenever I read \"candied walnuts\" in an entree's description, I just have to order it!\n\nThe side salad was a lot bigger than any side salad I've ever encountered before; it was big enough to satisfy us until the main entree arrived, but there was the extra insalata blu to contend w\/.  It was good, but we both favored the side Caesar salad.  The dressing was just perfect for the amount of greens present.  The eggplant parmigiana was a big disappointment!  My first two bites were a mix of eggplant, pasta, and cheese, and I found the combo to be very bland.  I then tried the eggplant and the cheese on its own, and I was dumbstruck to find that the eggplant tasted like the cheese, and vice-versa!  Even the pasta tasted the same as the veggie and the cheese.  I tried the part where the server added parmesan cheese, and there was no added flavor there, either!  Since I did not find satisfaction w\/ the entree, I started craving for something sweet-- the vanilla gelato w\/ strawberries was the answer :)  Mom didn't care for this dish, but no worries!  More for me!!\n\nThe best thing out of our experience at Macaroni Grill that afternoon was that when the main entree was delivered, our server had automatically split the entree onto two plates WITHOUT OUR HAVING TO ASK!  This simple act impressed us both and garnered this review an extra star :)\n\nI'd like to give MG another chance, but w\/ so many great non-chain Italian restaurants in the valley, I'll find it hard to justify going back so soon.
