Not bad but not good either. Food tasted alright but doesn't justify how much I paid. $7.99 is not bad for a burger but I think fuku can step up the quality a bit. I still dislike the bun. It was like those \"great value buns\". May I suggest Kings Hawaiian buns? But that might bring up the price. Also the overall size of the hamburger broke my heart a lil bit lol but I get it..gotta make $$. What I don't understand is the -meal upcharge- $5 to add fries and a drink? I'm no expert but that doesn't make sense? \n\nEveryone seem to have a problem w there service but on my visits everyone was friendly and personable.
