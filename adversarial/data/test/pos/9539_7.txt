All I have to say is Myrose. She is the only person allowed to touch my hair. I started going to her for over a year now and I am obsessed. They way she cuts and colors hair is amazing. I had never colored my hair before until just recently, and she did an amazing ombr√© on me. My sister and about five other friends go to her as well. This place is fairly new and beyond underrated. Hair cuts are affordable (make sure to tip well) and the staff is friendly. They provide free wifi, coffee and water. \n\nThank you Myrose for being the best hair dresser I've ever had.
