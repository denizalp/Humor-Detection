Since I'm reviewing strip clubs today, apparently:\n\nTalk of the Town!  It's downtown, it's seedy, it's probably the best place in town to check out girls who don't look like they've been beat with the silicone stick.  Tattoos are encouraged here - and we don't just means butterflies on the ankle.  This place caters to a more subculture crowd than the traditional strip clubs, with more subculture girls to go along with it.  All the girls are more approachable than at other places, too, and less forward and pushy.  Cheaper than a night at one of the big name places, and probably more fun.
