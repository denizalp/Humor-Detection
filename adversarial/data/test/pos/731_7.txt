Home of the GTA Rollergirls! I have only been here for roller derby-related activities, so I will review the arena as an athlete and spectator.\n\nThe surface slickness changes depending on the temperature, but the last time I skated here it was slightly sticky, so a harder wheel was helpful. The floor is polished concrete and the outline of a standard WFTDA track has been lightly painted directly on the floor, for ease of laying down a track quickly.\n\nThe suicide seating is great but there are no bleachers, so make sure you bring a folding chair. There is arena seating but it is behind glass, so it's a little better to sit at track level. Both suicide seating and arena seating have licensed areas so you have have alcohol while watching a bout.\n\nThe arena itself is a five-minute walk from Main Street subway station, which is convenient. There are not too many bars around the area though, making it almost necessary to have a car to get to an after party.\n\nTo check out the GTA Rollergirls schedule and see them play on Saturday nights, check the website: http:\/\/www.gtarollergirls.com.
