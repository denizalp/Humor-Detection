The teachers at Hamilton High School are beyond unwelcoming and have absolutely no consideracy. My daughter has a parking permit and she claims that there is a lot of traffic when she comes home from school. Because I am a concerned father, I drove to her school's parking lot to search for a better way out, with less traffic, for my daughter. A softball coach took a picture of my license plate and addressed that if he sees me roaming around the parking lot at any time, he will report me to security. Even after I explained myself, he was still rude and showed no signs of consideracy. I felt very disrespected and unwelcomed.
