The reviews are in and they're spot on!!!\nSuper clean, lots of shaved ice flavors, lots of Thrifty ice cream ( a shout back to my childhood at Walgreens ) and plenty of fun bottled and canned sodas. \nIt is convenient. \nThey are very nice people :)\nLove it's in the hood of North Phoenix ;)\nThumbs up Coneheads!!\nYou can trust me, I'm an ice cream loving Phoenician ;D
