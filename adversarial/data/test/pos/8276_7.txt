Seems like AYCE sushi spots are popping up everywhere in town!\n\nGlad to say, JJANGA is above the avg when it comes to FRESH taste and extremely fast service...almost TOO FAST!!\n\nI usually start with an order of Sake, Hamachi, and Ahi to test the waters on how fresh\/enjoyable my experience will be.  Happy to say that they were offering one of the better cuts in town during my visit.  They are on par with some of the best choices around here IMO!\n\nThey also offered a couple different options to separate themselves from the competition:\n\nI really enjoyed their Yuzu Hamachi.  The hamachi was fresh, and the yuzu was a nice compliment to the fish! Not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.\n\nHotategai. The scallops were delicious, and the masago was a nice consistency combination. \n\nHotate Ebi Skewer. The scallop and shrimp were cooked well, and doused in a mayo like sauce. Not bad!\n\nCalamari Ring. Good! Fairly tender, with a very soft and flavorful breading with a mellow sauce drizzled on top.\n\nMy food came out extremely quickly...because I was taking pictures of the food once it arrived, it felt a little overwhelming how fast they were coming out.  Order in SMALLER batches than you are used to when eating sushi!!\n\nHave fun :P
