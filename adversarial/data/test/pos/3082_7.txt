In response to Brian M. of Precision Window Tint from 8\/21\/2012:  It was actually The District parking lot. And the reason it was parked there is because I live there. Brian sure has a great imagination of how he wishes his conversations went. The entire reason I called Precision Window Tint in the first place was to take my car to Brian's place of business to get the whole thing taken care of. I would NEVER expect anybody to leave their shop to work on my car somewhere else (that doesn't make any sense). Brian's poor customer service skills have caused a huge headache to a very simple and logical solution. I run my own business and pretty much know that cussing out and threatening people is not in any way, shape, or form; good business.
