Okay, It's a Sears.  This location is about as exciting as the rest of Metro Center has become over the years.  Pretty sad, really.  About a small step up from the Desert Sky Mall location, this Sears is where I go to pick up my online purchases so I don't have to pay shipping. \n\n Downside?  Um, I picked up an order today and I received 4 pair of pants WITH NO bag!!!!  Just handed me four pairs of jeans and buh bye.  It's really odd.  You walk in and have to either scan your receipt or slide the credit card through the slider that you placed the order with.  Then it tells you to have a seat and then a person brings your order out.  I'm kinda surprised at that point that your order doesn't just shoot out from a hole in the wall!\n\nThe entire store is like a mausoleum with hardly any employees around.  I like getting my daughter's jeans here but other than that?  What do I like?  Not so much.  I guess it's good for appliances.  Yeah.  appliances.
