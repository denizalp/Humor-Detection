Dr. Schulman is a very personable dermatologist who explains issues well and seems to be thorough. Office is clean and bright with friendly staff. I couldn't not give them five stars. But I have to say this: what is it about doctors that makes them almost universally believe they can keep patients waiting. Would my legal clients wait an hour for a meeting with me?  Perhaps, but I would never test it. As much as I like this practice, today they were one of the worst offenders: showed up for an 8:30 appointment, seen an hour later. I ask: how backed up can they be first thing on a Saturday morning?
