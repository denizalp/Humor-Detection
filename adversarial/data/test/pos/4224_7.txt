Great school for adults \/ mature students. They offer the most flexibility in terms of being able to take full-time or part-time course load. Lots of scholarships and bursaries available. Easy to get to with TTC and new subway access is being built. \n\nSome of the buildings are old and need massive updates. They don't have good study spots and the library needs major renovations.
