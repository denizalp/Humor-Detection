This place really has it all! I came here with a few friends on Friday night and we all had a blast at this super cool restaurant! The ambiance and decor are fantastic. I don't know what this building was before but the architecture is just fantastic. As for food...DELICIOUS! I tried the calamari, deviled eggs and the scallops as an entree. Everything was carefully prepared and beautifully presented. The wine list is very extensive and has something to fit every budget. I was surprised to see a $30 bottle in such a nice place! All in all, great place for a date or a special night...a little pricier than the surrounding bar\/restaurants in Ohio City. Definitely worth a visit!
