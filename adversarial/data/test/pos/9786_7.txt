I stayed at Le St-Martin on a recent trip to Montréal and I really enjoyed it. \n\n+ First of all, the people working here are so, so friendly. (I think everyone in Montréal is super friendly though.) \n+ Then, the rooms are really, really nice - spacious with comfy beds and good showers. \n+ Thirdly, the location is good, fairly close to a metro stop even. \n+ And finally the price was more than reasonable.\n\nThey have a restaurant onsite that also offers what may have been the best room service breakfast I've ever had. And free Wi-Fi. I would definitely stay here again!
