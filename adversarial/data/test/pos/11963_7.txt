I wasn't seeking this place out, but after a bar crawl in the area, a friend suggested it as a somewhat-late-night stop for sustenance. Holy crap, were they on the money. Everything on the menu looked delicious. Each person ordered something different, so there was some drunken sharing going on, but when even an order of gravy fries with cheese curds is the best thing you've eaten all week, you know you're someplace special. The whole concept of the restaurant is honestly a bit over my head -- something about sustainable what-nots and locally sourced thing-a-ma-jigs. But with food this good, I would be OK with a baby seal being clubbed in the back room every once in a while. (JOKE!)
