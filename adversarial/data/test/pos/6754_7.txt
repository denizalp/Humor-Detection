Who's that knocking on the door?  Yep, it's Chris the Korean BBQ newbie.  Here, let me share some of this salt for you to take with my review...\n\nHaving never experienced Korean BBQ before I was a little hesitant but I do enjoy trying new things from different cultures (within reason).  This visit I had the Dol Sot Bi Bim Baap...aka the number 6 :-)  I enjoyed the meal except for the crispy seaweed strips that adorned the top of the bowl.  I know, I know...it's the way it should taste but every time I taste seaweed anything it reminds me (sorely) of being tossed upside down at the Jersey shore and coming up with a mouth full of water.  The rest of the bowl was quite nice but really didn't knock my socks off in the flavor department.  It wasn't flavorful or spicy or all that complex of a taste...kind of all ran together, taste-wise. Maybe there's something such as a sauce I should have added to the bowl?\n\nService was excellent.  I swear 4 different people came to the table to ensure everything was up to snuff.  Maybe that's how it always is, maybe it's because they could sense the fear in the white boys eyes.  Whatever the reason, I dig it.  I hope to return again soon so that I can try something the regulars suggest that may have a little more flavor to the dish.\n\np.s. I don't know who the foxxy lady is guarding the bathroom with the sign that says \"Take me home\" but can you give her my number?  Thanks.
