I've stayed from the worst of the worst (Excalibur and Circus Circus) to some of the best (MGM Grand), but Bellagio tops them all by a landslide. The hospitality here was on-point and the rooms are very beautiful. There's no wonder the check-in line was so long!\n\nWe stayed in the Spa Tower (King Suite). See my pictures for a better depiction! The suite was spacious (MUCH more spacious than the tiny suite at MGM) with a jet tub and a beautiful stand-up shower with his and her sinks. Unfortunately, they ran out of suites when a fountain view so we only had a view of the Rio and Palms casino. I guess you can't win them all. They check your key card before you can use the guest elevators, which I really liked to prevent rowdy people who aren't guests from coming in. That was an issue for us at the MGM... I'll write about that later...\n\nAnyway, we came home from dinner with a bunch of leftovers on our last night. We were having so much fun that we had forgotten to request a refrigerator until 11:30pm... oops! But not to worry, Bellagio was great and sent one over within 10 minutes. We also went to the Fitness Center (which is located in the Spa Salon (there are no signs so it's easy to miss!). The Fitness Center felt like a 24 Hour Fitness to me with lockers, towel service, and plenty of weights and machines. I wish I could live here forever!
