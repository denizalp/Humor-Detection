I remembered the days when I came down to Lee Garden Restaurant to eat at least once a month.\n\nI no longer visit here anymore and I don't remember why..\n\nBut last night visit did bring back memories..... \n\nThe interior and decoration is just like it used to be. The one thing I am glad is the ladies room is clean and even smell good! \n\nService here is excellent and fast! Maybe just a little too fast as I know some dishes should have taken longer to prepare and cook.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nSzechuan Chicken ($16)\n- bland tasting chicken breaded and deep fried\n- sauce is more sweet than spicy\n- the crispy chicken is really soggy too\n\nSmoked Chicken aka Grandfather Chicken half ($15)\n- The most disappointed dish of the night, since this used to be my favourite dish\n- Chicken suppose to be moist and tender with this smokey flavour from tea leaves, the honey sesame flavour from the glazing but what we served was a chicken that tasted bland, dried and the half of the skin was not even there\n\nSticky Rice with Chinese Sausages ($11)\n- Usually sticky rice suppose to made to order so there is still the fresh from the wok taste, but this rice was arrived on our table lacking everything \n\nZucchini with Garlic Olive ($8)\n- Not a bad dish but the garlic olive flavour definitely missing \n\nHoney Orange Ribs ($18)\n- I really not into honey orange sauce and this definitely not my go to dish usually\n\nBoth the complimentary soup and red bean dessert were overloaded with orange peel... taste was off... balance was off\n\nI can definitely have much better meal at this price point at a lot of higher end restaurants uptown which offers much better prepared food.\n\nSorry Lee Garden, I don't think I will ever come back, even for Old Time Sake!
