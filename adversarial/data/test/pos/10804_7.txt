5 stars for one of my very rare celebrity spottings! We weren't sure what to expect during the very hidden trek to the restaurant, but were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, service, and food. Unfortunately, I can't remember what the actual item I ordered was, but it they had something that tasted like fried mashed potatoes and it was heavenly. The fiance got the french toast bread pudding. They do warn you that's it's very \"decadent\" and they're not lying. Good, I just want meat and potatoes for every meal though! I love the sunlight that peeks through the large windows. \n\nI know you're dying to know now who it was that we saw... okay, it was just Kelsey Grammar. My fiance said, \"Look! It's Brendan Frasier.\" Too bad his real name isn't Frasier and the only reason I know his name is because of the Real Housewives. Lame.
