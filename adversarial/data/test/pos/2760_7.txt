First, the cost was ridiculously expensive.  I think I could have gone to Disneyland for less.  The animals lived in sub par conditions.  I was horrified to see their baby hogwarts in a glass room with electric blankets hanging down and the hogwarts nibbling on the electrical cords.  I was saddened to see the white tiger pace as they were in a cage too small and looked so unhappy.  On top of a very high admission fee, they also charged a few dollars for every attraction.  I will never return.
