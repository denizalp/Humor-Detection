We went there when my wife needed some help concerning possible UTI. Although there were doctors available, the front desk people were extremely rude. First they said they couldn't find my wife in the system (she had been there many times for John Martin). Next they said that they don't accept walk-ins and they would not direct me to a nearby urgent care center or another doctor. Their attitude towards patients is extremely hostile. \n\nI would strongly recommend against visiting this poor excuse for a doctor's office. They don't care about patient wellness at all!
