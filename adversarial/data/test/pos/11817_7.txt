Just relax...\n\nI've done a few floats from the small pods that made me feel claustrophobic to the large rooms that were overpriced. I've finally found my happy medium here!\n\nI'm always looking for ways to relax. I love foot massages & salt caves for quickies. I'm now adding this gem to my list.\n\nThe pod is actually very large. I asked if my man who is 6 7' could fit and the response was yes these were built for athletes and will hold someone 7 feet tall! Very exciting and bringing him next time!\n\nI found myself in here because I was in physical pain from EDC. Exhausted and couldn't focus. Irritable and couldn't sleep without crazy dreams. I'd like to report that I feel 100 times better after my session yesterday. If you've never tried this before and are hesitant do yourself a favor and use my link below for a first time deal and try it out for yourself. \n\nhttp:\/\/frd.co\/Vy8BTo\n\nHere is a quick snapshot of how it works:\n\nBefore your 60 minute float session begins you'll be greeted, answer a few questions and you'll watch a quick video. Any questions you have can be answered during this time. \n\nYou'll then be escorted to your private room.\n\nShower before entering the pod. Wash your hair if you use any products. \n\nThen you float for 60 mins into the abyss...naked :) \n\nTake another shower after you get out to wash off all the salt.\n\nYou'll most likely feel so damn good that you'll need some time before heading out and they have a beautiful relaxation room intended just for that with tea & water and you're surrounded by calming art and crystals.\n\nSome fun facts: \n\nYou can turn music on or off in your pod. I loved the music and kept it on the entire time. \n\nYou can pick your favorite color to light up your pod or keep it dark. I chose blue :) \n\nThe pod has 1000 pounds of salt in it in 180 gallons of water. You float like an angel...\n\nMeditate. Get lost. Forget about the world. I fell asleep and remember floating down a river, with the moon lighting the way and into the arms of a super hot native Indian American man who carried me to a peak to watch the sunrise. \n\nMy experience was epic!
