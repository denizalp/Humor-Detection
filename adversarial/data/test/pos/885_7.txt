Unfortunately, despite hoping high expectations of this company restaurant period of a week, and it only came twice -- three times the delivery person never showed up, but called at 12 midnight to apologize.\n\nThe owner did not answer calls why this happened.\n\nOn top, when I looked up their license, they are unlicensed and do not have a health permit to have a restaurant, nor serve or deliver food.\n\nThe two times the food did come, it was either undercooked and raw, or overcooked and bland. \n\nDo not recommend this.
