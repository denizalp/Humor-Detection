This experience went 100-0 real quick.\n\nWhen we got there the place wasn't crazy busy. We got seated right away and the servers were genuinely super nice and on top of things!\n\nThe rolls were decent, we tried the following:\n\nRolls-\n\nTiger\nShrimp Lover\nFreaky Friday\nBaked Salmon\nSpider\nHot and Juicy\nLisa Hand Roll\n\nAppetizers-\n\nCucumber Crab Salad\nSeaweed Salad\nScreaming Orgasm\nSweet and Spicy Potstickers\nTempura Calamari\n\nDessert-\n\nStrawberry Mochi duh\n\nLike I said the rolls were decent but I'm sad to say we will not be returning due to the horrendous wait time to receive rolls.\n\nThere was a time we waited 28 minutes for a roll. \n\nI get they only had two sushi chefs but there were times when we saw rolls waiting for ten plus minutes to be picked up and taken to tables. It's unfair to blame the chefs when they're doing their job.
