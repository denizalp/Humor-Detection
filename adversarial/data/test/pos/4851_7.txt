I know that there is a God because my prayers were answered in the form of the Mac Shack! They should change their name to Mac and Cheezus because I had a religious experience when I ate their delicious Gluten Free offerings. \n\nFirst, the staff is amazingly nice and professional and the atmosphere is clean and inviting.\n\nSecond, they will make any of their dishes with gluten free pasta...can I get an amen?\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nAsiago Blue Mac ($6.95) Asiago, blue cheese, and pecorino romano in a luscious creamy sauce over perfectly cooked (and this is very difficult to do) gluten free pasta. Wow, this was so good. The sauce was perfectly balanced and the portion was hearty.\n\nCheddar Mac ($5.95) Wisconsin cheddar, aged white cheddar, and monterey jack cheese once again in a creamy sauce over GF pasta. This was great too!\n\nYou can also create your own pasta dish from a selection of sauces, pastas and other ingredients. \n\nI was so impressed by the great, friendly service, their ability to properly cook GF pasta, and their willingness to create great food for the gluten challenged. \n\nThank you Mac and Cheezus, um I mean Mac Shack, for answering my gluten free prayers!
