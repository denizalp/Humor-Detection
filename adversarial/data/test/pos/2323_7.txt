I came here with a friend for happy hour on a Saturday night (it's nice they have HH on Saturday). The space is cute and they had live music, which was fine. We only ordered cocktails, which were a decent deal on hh (6$ I think). First I tried a cocktail that had ginger, lime juice, pineapple, and a chili vodka.... I was unsure about it, but the bartender assured me it was good. Unfortunately, it was one of the most horrific drinks I have tried.... I could taste nothing but the chili vodka. I couldn't drink it and (after waiting a very long time trying to gain the attention of a staff member) I was able to trade it for a different drink, which was nice of them. I tried a drink that had a fig infused whiskey... it was much better, still not wonderful, but much better than the previous drink. Overall, the place was alright. I probably won't be running back, but I would have no issue going back if a friend invited me.
