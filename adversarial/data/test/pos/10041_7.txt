Pretty much the same issues others had here. In ER post doc bite. Not informed hand surgeon not covered by my insurance. Ended up in tense discussions with their office while they insisted if BCBS didn't pay, I'd have to.\n\nAu contraire. No I don't.\n\"Ah, but we will send you to COLLECTIONS.\"\n\"Yeah, you have fun with that. Your boss wants to work for free, that's his business. Every other doc in this town has contracts with insurance companies, your boss wants to play Russian Roulette...not my problem.\"\n\"But we did you a favor and are working to get your insurance company to pay in full.\"\n\"Nope, you're doing YOURSELF a favor, because all you get out of me is what the insurance company pays. Now have fun talking to the collection people.\"\n\nYes, the insurance company paid and I paid the doctor. If you are in the hospital under emergency conditions, you are not in any condition to agree to any financial terms. You are in pain and you are probably on pain meds.\n\nOh, and aftercare? A joke. Beyond a joke. They weren't going to take out the pin. Wanted me to go to a surgicenter, or somesuch nonsense. \"Listen,\" I said, \"Somebody is taking out this pin and it won't be me. Either you take it out, or I'll find a lawyer who will.\"\n\nThey took it out, but the SOBs wouldn't give me lidocaine. Jerks.
