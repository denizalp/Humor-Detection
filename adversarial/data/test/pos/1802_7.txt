Came here with some friends and was pleasantly  surprised. \n\nI don't quite remember everything we ordered but I got a bulgogi soup with chewy noodles. I figured that since I love bulgogi, soup and chewy noodles individually... I couldn't go wrong with the choice. It really was just so so. There was a lot of meat but nothing else. I couldn't even find the noodles unless I dug around a bit. The soup itself was also a little too sweet, but had good flavor. My friends really enjoyed their dishes though.\n\nService was great and prices are typical for Korea town. It's not the best restaurant in but the homey feel and Korean comfort food is definitely something I'd come back for.
