So...there are dive bars and there are trashy bars. This one was the latter. \n\nFirst off, I will preface that I was probably too old for this bar...I will fully admit that. \n\nA friend and I were in the area tonight and decided we wanted to have a quick drink so we could chit chat. We saw Betty's and thought \"Its open and it looks pretty quiet\" so we stopped in.\n\nThe place was cutesy I guess and could be fun on a busy weekend night, but when its empty it just sort of looks sad.\n\nThe waitress approached our table quickly, but as she was taking our order she was lifting up the hem of her belly shirt and was scratching. Nice...classy...\n\nI ordered a rum and diet coke. The coke was flat and I'm pretty sure the rum came from a plastic bottle. All for $7. Awesome. Well worth the money. For $7 I could have bought the same bottle of rum and a 2 liter of diet coke AND it would have had the fizz...\n\nMy friend asked for a glass of wine, which she should have known better, lol. Our waitress looked confused and had NO clue what kind of wine there was. There's a white one \"I think... chardonnay?\" Oh dear lord. And yeah, you guessed it $7 for something that could have possibly been a Chardonnay. But you know, like, wine is for old people, for sure.\n\nSo anyway, we sort of finish our drinks and decide to head out. We tried to flag down the waitress to pay our tab, but that was next to impossible. She was after all dealing with some \"crazy-ass customers.\" Her words, not mine.\n\nSo she comes over and looks at our card and says, \"Oh we have a minimum of a $20 order to use a card. There is an ATM over there.\" Oh for pete's sakes. My friend just looks at her and says \"I'm sure there is someone you can ask to see if we could just run the card this one time.\" Sure enough there was, so we did. You get a star for that.\n\nSo then we try to sign the bill and the pen doesn't work. I take the pen to the bar (our waitress was busy with the \"crazy-ass customers\" again) and I swear to God the bartender tested the pen as if I was lying about it. Just hand me a new pen honey.\n\nVisiting this bar was like one giant joke. Pretty sure its not my scene, so no worries of ever going back.
