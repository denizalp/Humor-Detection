La Bocca is the perfect place for a quiet but fun evening.  It's great to take a date or your parents, a buddy of yours, to celebrate someone's birthday at the tables outside or for a business meeting with a group of colleagues.\n\nOne time I went there for a business meeting.  My boss told me to go.  I don't know why.  I showed up and I didn't know anyone there and they were all talking about biotechnology and, while a cool subject, not the field of work I'm in at all.  And everyone there was baby-faced and young.  I knew the guy speaking, but that's about it.  It was happy hour and I got drunk as fuck and ate free pizza.  So, if you were there, I was the guy wearing a tie that nodded approvingly during the lecture and slurped down like three cocktails and three beers.\n\nAltogether, I've probably been to La Bocca either five or six times and I'm always, always pleased with the service and the food.  Even when it's crowded, and I have seen it pretty packed a couple times, someone's going to be there to ask you if you need another drink or more water or anything.\n\nI've tried a lot of their different pizzas.  I've had the badboy with the truffle oil and spinach, the Sicily, whichever one it is that's got like cheese and basil on it.  I'm pretty well-versed in what these guys offer for their standard pizzas and each one is pretty awesome.  Their appetizers kick ass too.  Love the cheese platter.  The Mediterranean platter slaps me in the face with its deliciousness.\n\nFor some reason lately, lots of restaurants I've been eating at, I've been ordered their sangria.  As of now, La Bocca ranks up pretty highly.  That fucker was delicious.  Fruity and sweet, but not too sweet.  It was great.\n\nThis place is pretty rad.  If you want to class it up without spending too much money (single pizzas are as cheap as $8), this is definitely the place.
