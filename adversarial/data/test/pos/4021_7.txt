When I walked in and saw the huge Boar's Head sign I figured this place might not be so bad. I was right. So I ordered a pastrami sandwich and they put a good amount of pastrami in it and the bread was good. I will stop by on a lunch break when in the area now that I know about this place. I saw they had some Dr. Brown's Black Cherry so I got one of those to have with my sandwich. I heard about it from my fellow OC yelper buddy, Rohlin so I had to try it! Very good!\n\nYou can get oil, noodles, sauce, and more here. I noticed in the case they had homemade sausages (I will be trying these eventually) and a variety of olives. I was going to get a cannoli until I noticed them in the case filled. I prefer when the cannoli gets filled after you order it. \n\nThey deliver.
