$2.17\/gal on regular unleaded at the Summerlin Costco Gas station when nearby gas stations are offering at $2.49.  Sounds great to me!  Only catch is that you must have a Costco membership.\n\nDue to the best gas price in town, the line is always long (except first thing in the morning or when they are about to close up for the day), so expect to wait.  But gazing up at this Costco Gas is totally worth it, especially if you plan to shop at Costco anyways.\n\n5 stars for everything, except the long lines of cars and the associated wait time.
