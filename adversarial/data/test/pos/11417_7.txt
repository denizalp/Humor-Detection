New small locally owned full service car wash. You can get your car washed for as cheap as 7.99! You can give them your keys and let them run it through or do it the old fashioned way and drive it through yourself with the kids in the back. Kid's love that!! Their regular hand wash is just 11.99 you really cant beat that. There's not 40 dude's bum rushing your for 10 different things when you pull in. A giant plus when you just want a frign car wash if you ask me!! There is a bigger one just down the street they are opening soon I plan on returning.
