I hate rare meat. The whole thought of blood grosses me out like nobody's business. \n\nI ordered the Original (roast beef, chedder and creamy horseradish). When I opened it up, there it was: rare roast beef soaking the bread with its nasty blood juice...ewwwww! Are you effing kidding me?! \n\nI closed my eyes and devoured one of the most delicious sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life. They made a rare meat hater like me a fan with one delicious bite. \n\nThis place warrants 5 stars for the mere fact that they are open 24 hours. \n\nEarl of Sandwich, I love you.
