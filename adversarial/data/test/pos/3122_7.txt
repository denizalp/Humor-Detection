This Super Target is just that, SUPER. I came here because I was in the neighborhood and needed to get food and supplies for a party\/cookout for 80 people. They had everything I needed in the grocery section. By choosing the Target brands and using the cartwheel app I saved quite a bit. I'm not sure when I will need to shop in this neighborhood again, but if I do I will choose this Super Target.
