It's the 31st! Baskin-Robbins had an incredible deal: $1.31 per scoop. On the 31st of each month, they have cool ice-cream deals. To celebrate summer and beat the heat, I ferried 5 teenagers to B & R for a treat. I ordered a single scoop of Jamocha on a sugar cone. One daughter got daiquiri ice in a cup. Another ordered daiquiri ice on a cake cone. My son had the Wild and Reckless sherbert on a cake cone. One of our guests got a double scoop of cookie dough and chocolate chip on a waffle cone. Another one of our guests got a single scoop of Rocky Road ice cream on a cake cone. He also got a sweet treat for his mom. Our bill was under $15. \n\n\"Awwww, Mom, do we have to help you review for Yelp?\" \n\n\"Yes, that i why I take you along.\"\n\nEveryone who had a cone reported that the cones were fresh, crunchy and tasty. \n\"The Rocky Road is a perfect blend of almonds, marshmallow and chocolate ice cream.\" \n\n\"Daiquiri ice is our favorite.\"\n\n\"The cookie dough and chocolate was good. I really like the waffle cone.\"\n\n B & R is great because they always put up a consistent product. I HAD A VAN FULL OF SATISFIED TEENAGERS!
