I've experience something of an about-face on this place.  I don't know if the food has gotten better, or my tastes have changed, but now, when I go, I find at least three or four dishes I really like.  Curry goat?  Yes, please!\n\nOn my first time going back in almost a year, they had the most warm, moist, delicious gulab jamon (probably butchered the spelling there) I've ever had.  Now I have cravings for those tasty little balls (I'll let you come up with your own punchline).
