If you don't buy here you got ripped off!! Mardy is amazing and my Pool table is amazing as well! It's hard to find the type of customer service that city billiards provides! For no extra charge I got a starter set and got to choose the color of cloth that came with my table!.!.!.!.!.! Awesome!!!! The guys that built the table at my house were fun to talk to and professional.  My table is perfectly level and plays like no pool table I have ever used. Thanks for an amazing experience...
