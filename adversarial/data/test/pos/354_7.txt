This place is 5 mins away from my house and it's such a great neighborhood spot. I'm really not a beer girl, and luckily they have a great selection of other drinks as well.\n\nParking is super easy, it's on the side of the Smith's building, and you can actually turn left onto Town Center when leaving there!\n\nStaff is super nice and Nick, the owner is awesome!\n\nDefinitely go check it out!
