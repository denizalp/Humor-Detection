We decided to attend this place and to be sure that we will get seats we decided to reserve a table, but we changed our minds after we read on Yelp that you'll be charged if you cancel your reservation. So we came here without reservation and were seated immediately. So I think it is absolutely no sense to make reservation.\n \nInterior was comfortable and designed well. It has very nice and colorful bar. The space is divided into areas.\nWe had our seats in the dining area. Ambiance was restful. Nice place to have a rest with friends and talk a little.\n \nWe took blue corn pancake BBQ duck, smoked salmon, tuna nachos and shrimp tacos. After all these got inside us, I can't say I am impressed with food. Food look and design were more impressive. I was impressed with margarita as well, I really loved it. \nNo claims to service. It was good, servers were attentive and helped us with info about dishes on the menu. Thanks guys.\n \nNext time if we decide to come here, we definitely will come fed and sit in the bar area and enjoy margaritas.
