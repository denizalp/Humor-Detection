Send me a coupon and I will come. This was a BOGO and I tried the salad with the blue cheese dressing. It is a bit pricey at $10 for a small though. The chicken, bacon pannini was decent I heard and the spicy hummus received more good tidings. With the coupon it is worthy, but otherwise maybe a few times a year. The limit for salad ingredients seems to be four before you start jacking up the price too much.
