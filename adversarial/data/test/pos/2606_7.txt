My cousin Bibi and her husband Marcos came to visit this weekend, we hung out, BBQ'ed, played spades, and dominoes, and drank some really fantastic margaritas courtesy of Marcos. YUM!  So Sunday we're all tired from the day before and hungry, so we tried to hit up Sushi Ave, but it was closed!  BOOOO!  So we were like wtf, what now?  We ended up at Juan Jaime's.  We hadn't been there for a long while since moving to Gilbert... what a disapointment!!!\n\nOur server was not very nice to say the least.\n\nMorgan accidentallly spilled her drink while playing with Dom (bloody knuckles, don't ask!).  The server handed her some napkins and left... didn't bother to get anyone to clean the HUGE puddle on the floor!  Then at the end of the meal charged us for the spilled drink!  ugh...\n\nTheir margaritas sucked ass... I mean seriously, they were bitter and disgusting, I didnt even drink mine.  Mind you, we did have the best Margaritas ever the night before... but these were just gross!\n\nThe food was bland and luke warm... I had the mahi mahi taco, they all had a combo plate and weren't impressed... I just really hate when you think you're gonna take a guest somewhere nice and it turns out to be shitty.  Pisses me off.\n\nI'm never going to Juan Jaime's again.  Theysuck.com
