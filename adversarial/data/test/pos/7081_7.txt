I know, I know! But this place was so good, cheap and convenient! They were open 24 hours and had a pretty good selection. Plus, their prices were pretty darn good! I think I ate here more than I did at the hotel. I loved the beef burrito so much that I started making it at home! Wish they had some of these places in Hawaii!
