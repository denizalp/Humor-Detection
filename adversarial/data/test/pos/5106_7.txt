I was looking for something local for a pedicure, I live around the corner from Highlands nail and spa so I thought I would give them a try.  I walked in for my very first visit and I was greeted by a very nice guy whom welcomed me.   I picked out a color and sat for a few minutes and waited to sit in my chair for my very first pedi there.\n\nIt seemed that a few of the other girls giving Pedi's were more requested and had a bigger clientale.  I sat in the chair and slowly put my feet in the water and the water was luke warm at best.  Ok, I can live with that, no biggie even though I would like to soak my aching feet in warm water.\nThe girl proceeded to give me a pedi and I was shocked when she was done, she really needs to put some muscles into that massage, come on girl really?  I go there for a massage, I could care less about the nail polish, rub my aching feet please.   \n\nShe put some lotion on my legs and rubbed and did my feet for 5min with no pressure.  The hot stones felt very good, who wouldn't like that!  I thought the customer service was great, everyone seemed very friendly and the place was really clean.  I felt very comfortable there for my first visit.\n\nI will give them another try, I did think they were very sweet to the customers, but I will next time ask for someone that will give a foot massage and put some muscles into it.\n\nMy feet afterwards looked great, loved the polish and she polished them very nice, however I would rather get more of a massage because my feet when I left felt like I didn't get a massage at all.\n\nEvery person does a pedi maybe a little different, I do not have ticklish feet so the harder the better for me, I work on my feet as a bartender so I need that foot rubdown, I will go back and try again..
