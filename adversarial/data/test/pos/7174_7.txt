This is the go to boba spot. The staff is super friendly and the drinks come out in a timely manner. The only issue is that they have limited seating. When it gets packed, the tiny venue gets overheated and it is more comfortable to wait outside. \n\nI have tried a few drinks and love the fact that they give options to adjust the drink's sweetness and amount of ice. When the drinks are ready, the staff announces that any adjustments can be made. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of boba, but theirs is good. The fact that they are not overcooked and not overtly sweet makes me not as hesitant to order them. Especially since they have a Yelp check in offer for a free topping.
