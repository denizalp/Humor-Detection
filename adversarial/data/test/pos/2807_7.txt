To Whom It May Concern:\n \nI am writing to you today to tell you about the exceptional service that \"All My Sons Moving & Storage\" company gave me.  From my initial email (which they responded back to me within minutes), to the actual move and completing the transaction was totally above and beyond service expected.  They were precise and everything went very smooth.  They arrived on time (in fact they were early).  I was given a window time of arrival between 9-10 am and they arrived at my home in Mesquite at 8:30 am.  The two employees scheduled for my move were very courteous and they ran circles around me and were quick to do anything.  I didn't once have to ask them to do anything twice.  They handled all of my furniture with special care.  We then moved all my belongings to Henderson and once we got there, again they were quick, efficient, and very caring.  I had them bring the king size bed up stairs and apologized that it was up stairs as I am 6 mo pregnant and could not help.  The driver replied with \"no problem Kandy, this is my job and I am happy to do it\".  Woweee, that was so nice to hear.  This company is top notch.  They went over all the charges before hand and then again when we were finished.  I would totally recommend this company to any\/all!!  If you want exceptional service with a great customer service...this is the company to pick!!  \n \nI rate them from 1 -10 with 10 being the BEST....I give them 100!!!  They are that good!!
