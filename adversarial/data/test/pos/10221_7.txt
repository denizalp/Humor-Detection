I may be pickier than I should be about parks, and this is mainly a review of the dog park portion of this park. Other than being super close to my home, this place doesn't have a lot of great amenities. There are three separate sections for different sized dogs, and there is grass, which is saying something for dog parks in Vegas. However, something that really bothers me is that the water is OUTSIDE the dog park enclosure. So if your dog needs some water mid-playtime... in the desert... when it's over 90Â°, you have leash them up, walk them outside of the fence and then they can hydrate. So it's a bit annoying and doesn't seem well thought out. \n\nThe dog park is kept very clean, no flies, most people seem to clean up after their dogs, and I haven't had any run ins with any aggressive dogs yet either. However, that may be because most of the time, there aren't any dogs at the park. So bring a toy, and your own water bowl if you want to make the most out of your pup's time.
