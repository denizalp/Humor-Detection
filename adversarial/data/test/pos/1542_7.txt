I found this nice little wing place in a easy to find spot location. It was my first visit to this restaurant so I was looking up at the menu for a little bit to figure out what I wanted to order. There was a wide variety of wing sauces. I was unfamiliar with their ATL wing flavor and the cashier was very nice and offered me a sample. \n\nI ordered the ATL syle, Honey Habanero, and Hot wings with a side of salad. All the flavors were delicious.
