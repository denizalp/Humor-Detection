So I feel kinds a weird writing a review about a church. But I love this church.\n\n I was hopping around and hoping to find a place where I could share my love for Jesus and feel like I belong. New City feels like home. \n\nLots of amazing community, worship team literally rocks, and Pastor Brian really hits home with his teaching. Plus this church really is part of Phoenix. Lots of outreach which I really appreciate.
