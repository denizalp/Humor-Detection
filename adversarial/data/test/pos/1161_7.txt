We visited on their opening night after discussing this new wine & cheese bar with a fellow Yelp buddy. The space is intimate and really cute and it was pretty packed for opening night. They share the space with Alphabet City that is an event space and a curtain wall separates the bar so noise filters over to the bar area. They're located on the corner in the old Garden Theatre block. \n\nThe nibbles they offer looked pretty fun. Lots of cheeses, olives, pickles, and munchies like grilled cheese to choose from. The wine by the glass list looked decent but somewhat overpriced. I ordered a glass of Albari√±o for $15 then when I saw the bottle realized I've bought this wine a couple of times for around $12. My husband said similar things about his red. Clearly this area needs some work. Wine patrons will always Google any wine they like to see how much it costs - fact!\n\nI'd love to see them succeed in this cute little space   The concept is fantastic and clearly they will have tons of neighborhood support. They just need to step up their wine game and either serve what they're currently doing with more realistic prices or get better wines for their current price points.
