Fascinations is a treasure and I love this location! It's a great size and the variety of things you can find here is terrific.\n\nCame here a few days ago for some sexxayyyy post-Christmas surprises for my man and like usual, I wasn't disappointed.\n\nWhat sets Fascinations apart from a lot of other \"sex shops\" is that the store itself is clean and bright and has a classy, yet tastefully naughty feel. \n\nIt is NOT geared toward the creeper in the trench coat and dark glasses looking for \"barely legal\" masturbation material.\n\nI can walk into this place alone and not feel gawked at by pervs. Yay!\n\nIt's a great \"couples\" experience too.\n\nThey sell pretty lingerie, have myriad sex toys for both genders, adult movies, party favors, special occasion adult greeting cards, and much much more. \n\nI ran into some S&M stuff that almost made me clutch my pearls but I remembered I wasn't wearing any.\n\nBut it does go to show that they really do try to cater to all preferences, which is awesome. Sex positivity & Fascinations for the win!
