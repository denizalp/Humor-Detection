Everything I've said about this store in the previous review remains true, we love us some Scooter Girl in my house! \n\nI had to pop back here to add a few things:\n+Their baby products are excellent (think organic sunscreen, teething rings)\n+Their toddler jewelry selection is legit (I know someone into the stuff;)\n+When there are street fairs, they participate with wicked deals
