I have never had Chicago style pizza but my friends in Chicago highly recommended Giordano's to me when it opened. We went on a Saturday night in December and it wasn't that busy. We ate in the upstairs portion of the restaurant (there's a downstairs outdoor portion in the Ballys shopping area as well) and the decor was very industrial, the walls I think were garage doors which gave a nice ambiance.\nOur server was fantastic, energetic, and very knowledgable. He even knew where their farms were that they sourced their dairy and tomatoes from. I ordered their sangria which was inexpensive and strong, I enjoyed it. I had a few because the pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook. We also enjoyed the bruschetta in the meantime.\nI think I actually heard angels singing when they brought out our pizza and cut the first slice. The cheese oozed absolutely everywhere and I could not wait to take my first bite. For how insane this pizza looks, it's surprisingly light. The crust was almost like a cracker, I don't like pizza crust typically and I could not get enough of it. I'm glad we only a medium because with three people there were still leftovers.\nBetween the excellent service and otherworldly pizza, I'd recommend everyone and anyone get a pie here.
