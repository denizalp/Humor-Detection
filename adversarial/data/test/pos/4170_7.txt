Dude and I were seeking Pumpkins for our annual Halloween tradition: \"Create the most ridiculous carving you can come up with!\"\n\n*2015's creations were a Dave Grohl and a Donald Trump-O-Lantern!*\n\nI'm lazy and usually just get them from a grocery store. Well this year I got OBSCENELY lazy being out of town almost all of October, and couldn't find one. :( \n\nNever fear... Yelp Almighty directed us to Mother Nature's Farm.\n\nNow obviously we don't have any little ones so we didn't check out the attractions beyond picking two GIANT pumpkins - Pretty reasonably priced for $15 a pop! \n\nThe place was pretty cute for just a farm off the road, and we took a couple of obnoxious fall pictures. \n\nIf you're looking for quality pumpkins at just about any size next year, stop in. Heck, bring your little ones for the hayride too!
