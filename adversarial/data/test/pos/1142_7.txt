Don't let the dirty floor, missing floor tiles, lack of decor fool you.  The food IS as dismal as the restaurant.  We got chicken with broccoli, House Egg Fu Young and steamed dumplings.  No flavor, limp vegetables, fried rice consisted of gray rice with no egg or vegetables.  A complete waste of $17.70!!!
