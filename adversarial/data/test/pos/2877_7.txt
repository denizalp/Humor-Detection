I come to Vegas 2 times a year. I only stay at the cosmo. I have stayed here since I was 21 years old. My friends dad is one of the founders of the company that owns the cosmo. Yeah. I guess it's a NY thing. But anyways. \n\nFor those of you who have not been to Vegas and are considering staying at the cosmo. I highly recommend it. First location location location...  the cosmo is centrally located on the vegas strip. You will have to still walk or take a cab. But you can walk to mostly everything because you are centrally located. The sky ridge will take you to ether aria or you can cross the bridge to planet Hollywood. The location is amazing. \n\nPrice. Price is bit more expensive than other hotels. In Vegas the saying goes you get what you pay for. Most of the people who stay at the cosmo are younger 21-35. The hotel is very modern and sexi. They pride there selves on this theme. Very risky provocative themed. I happen to love that. If you want a more classic feel bellagio may be more your style. \n\nI have stayed in just about every type of room the cosmo offers. Almost every room has a terrace. Which is awesome. You will have to ask for a fountain view or city view terrace. I usually stay in the 2br with fountain view. Or the wrap around terrace suite fountain view. Their have only been two room types I have not stayed in yet. The lanai suites and the reception suite. All rooms have been clean except one time but the maid changed the pillow. \n\nThis trip I had the opportunity to stay in one of there 3 story bungalow suites. Ok. The bungalow suites are awesome!!  It's 3 story's with 1 br and 2 bathrooms and a hot tub with a full kitchen living room and some other room. I guess a chill room. There is also a outdoor deck that looks over the bellagio fountains. On the other side there is a hot tub that overlooks marquee dayclub. You have private access to marquee dayclub. Great for having girls and guys come back to hang out. You also have a private entrance to marquee nightclub in the same hallway as your suite. You have a 24 hr security guard outside your door if you ever need him. All of this was quoted for $2,500-$5,000 a night. Weekends were $5,000-10,000. Depending on what was going on. Me and 3 friends stayed for 3 nights. It was cool private and exclusive. Our host josh was there whenever I needed him. Big shout out to josh. Thank you man. \n\nFood. The cosmo has a few different options. Being from Ny secret pizza is the closest thing I can find to Ny pizza in Vegas. Except gramaldies but my 2 fav places to eat are Holsteins burgers and shakes. The burgers are organic and really tasty. My fave spot is egg slut. Omg... egg slut. I want to buy one just to put in Manhattan. Literally the best egg sandwich. It's gourmet tho. Nothing beats a bacon egg and cheese in NyC. But. Egg slut is amazing for breakfast. I eat there every morning I'm at the cosmo. The lines do get really long. Like 20+ min wait for a egg sandwich. Not even joking. I like it soo much. I ordered 3 sandwiches before my flight back to NY. I brought those sandwiches through TSA. \n\nOverall. Not just because my friend. But I really do like staying at the cosmo. I wouldn't stay here 2 times a year if I did not like it. They treat you well. I'll be back here every time I'm in Vegas unless something else comes up. Give them a try you will not re gret it!!
