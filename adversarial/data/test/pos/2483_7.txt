I've been in countless conversations as a west coaster extolls the virtues of In-N-Out Burger; I then salivate awaiting the day I'll taste unparalleled burger excellence.  Today was that day.\n\nI will say this; it's the best chain fast food burger you can get in America. Now, you must remember, it is still just a burger.\n\nImagine the $150 burger at Daniel; will the taste stand up to the anticipation?  At some point in the continuum, no experience can possibly meet the high expectations. I was past that point, but that doesn't mean that I can't recognize this fantasticness.\n\nWhat really got me was the grease.  \n\nThe grease dripping from the burger wasn't the solid grease you get from a burger at every other fast-food chain, it was probably 75% water\/25% grease.  Since the patties were created with fresh, never frozen beef, you get this product.  That wasn't the only mark of quality I hung on to.\n\nThe tomatoes were more crisp than the lettuce most places, and the lettuce crunched like a potato chip.  As the pickles protruded from the sides of the sandwich, I began to ponder what I would have received if I'd ordered extra pickles.  The cheese was deli style; thick, substantive. \n\nI ordered the fries well-done; my mistake.  They came out like potato sticks.  Not terrible, but just stick to the regular fries.\n\nThe Neapolitan Shake - I received it before my meal was ready and drank it in seconds.  Without question, the shake was the highlight of the meal.  More dense than the McDonald's and BK shakes, thinner than a Frosty; vanilla, chocolate and strawberry never combined to create such a simple taste sensation.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful place.  For the money, it is tough to beat.  But, does it beat Ben's Chili Bowl?  A Fenway Sausage?  No.  \n\nBut for a chain . . . Probably the best bang for the buck out there.
