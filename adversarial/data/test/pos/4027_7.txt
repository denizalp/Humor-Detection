OK where do I begin,I'll give the place a three for there efforts to correct everything wrong here. We arrived at our room a \"king suite\". The room was decorated well but the cleaniness was subpar. The tub was scratched with black marks and best of all the heater did not work. It looked as if they attempted to replace this wall heater because the stucco was not painted to match the wall. There was no coffee maker and did Imention that it was about 39 degree outside and in the room, and just to recap the heater did not work :) Thank God for a blow dryer.\n\nWe were moved to an \"upgraded\" room called the \"swingers room\". It was an ok room if you are in to the 50 shades of Grey type thing. Here is the issue with this room I'm here now writing this review listening to the annoying sound of planes fly overhead, I can hear everything above me from my neighbors, the people in the hall, and outside. The remotes were not working and still no coffee maker to make a warm drink in this cold weather. The hotel has an OK concept but right now it is the equivalent to a trashy whore playing dress up as a class act.
