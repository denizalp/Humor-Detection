Best salon experience I have ever had, hands down! From start to finish, everything was perfect. The salon itself is beautiful, everyone is so nice, they carry amazing products, and Heather rocked my socks off. You don't know your true capabilities as a blonde, until you go see her. She's the best! 10\/10 recommend.
