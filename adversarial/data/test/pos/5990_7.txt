Best breakfast I've eaten in a loooong time.  This place is worth the wait (and trust me, you WILL be waiting at least 30-40 minutes... thankfully the NoWait app exists).\n\nI read about this restaurant on some Calgary food blog where they raved about their breakfast poutine bowls.  The rest of their menu looks amazing as well, but I didn't come here for plain-Jane bacon and eggs.  On my server's recommendation, I opted for the \"Hog and Scallops\" poutine bowl (and I also added black truffle just to be extra fancy).\n\nIt was so.  Damn.  Good.  Two huge, perfectly seasoned and cooked scallops, with chunks of salty bacon mixed in with their home fries and that ridiculously addicting hollandaise sauce.  The black truffles added another element to the dish that took it to a whole 'nother level, and they did NOT skimp on the truffles either!  This is definitely a rich and decadent breakfast, but it's worth all the calories and every single clogged artery.\n\nI don't live in Calgary, so unfortunately I can't make this a regular haunt, but rest assured - the next time I'm in the city, OEB Breakfast Co. will be first on my list!\n\nOVERALL: 5\/5.  Amazingly delicious food - that Hog and Scallops poutine bowl was one of the best things I've ever eaten for breakfast.  I can't wait for my next visit to Calgary just so I can eat here again!
