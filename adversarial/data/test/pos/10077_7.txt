Life is full of surprises. Every once in a while we are supposed to indulge. Last night (and maaaybe this morning) I ate donuts from Welcome Chicken + Donuts. My first foray into the heaven of sugar was a donut covered in cheddar \"Apple fritter with Wisconsin Cheddar\". A bit dubious I went with the flow. Handed over to me my eyes widened. I thought donuts were required to have a hole in the middle.\n\nNo.\nThis cheddar donut was humongus - about the size of my hand. Filled with a gooey creamy sweat something I was very happy. Motivated by this wonderful experience I ordered another to take home. Based simply on looks I took home a white iced donut with sprinkles. In hindsight this was an excellent means to create a sugar coma first thing in the morning. It was the breakfast of champions.\n\nWill is the best, most awesome employee *ever* to walk this earth. That kid is full of energy and can make anyone laugh.\n\nI can only imagine what eating a combination of donut + fried chicken could do to my system at the same time. I might just die.
