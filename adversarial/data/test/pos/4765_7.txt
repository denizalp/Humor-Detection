We love this Over Easy. The food is fresh and delicious. I especially like the egg white and aspargus omelette. Our 22 yr old son loves the WOlf pack and our 13 yr old like the chocolate pancake. Big Daddy and I often share the lox and onions with egg whiles. DIVINE.\n\nBetsy as the new GM has made a tremendous improvement in the atmostphere and fun of the place. Sam is a great server and they run a well oiled machine. They know their regulars and they take care of them. Eat there once or twice a week. Love it!
