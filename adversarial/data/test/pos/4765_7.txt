ohay June! (yeah, she reads the reviews. I swear she's not paying me *much* for this...)\nJUST KIDDING. SHE'S GENUINELY AWESOME.\nNothing has changed since my last visit in terms of her amazingness.\n\nI thought I'd just mention that she carries a whole line of Kevin Murphy products which she (and my friends) swear by. She also dishes out hefty samples...\n...so whatchu waitin fo'?\nI also failed to mention last time that she provides great hair-chair (?) talk! Unlike those awkward stylists who just cut your hair silently while you stare ahead into the mirror.
