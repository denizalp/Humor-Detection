Arrived at The Cosmopolitan without pomade for my new undercut tapered doo! Came to the spa and was greeted by Kymber. She offered me to use the sample product, fetched me a comb, and I was complete! I told her I was at the hotel for a few days. Kymber said just come by as style my hair using the sample product. How lovely and such customer service, I purchased a jar of Orbie, the pomade of the stars!
