I don't know what it is about Popeyes, but their fried chicken is so good! I once got KFC because I was like, \"oh they're both fried chicken so it's probably going to be about the same.\" No way! I don't really know what happened to KFC but it's not as good as it used to be.\n\nPopeyes is really good at making every location taste consistent. It always tastes fresh and crispy. The spicy option is also great. The mashed potatoes and fries are yummy but all the other sides are okay. \n\nService was good here. Definitely recommend this squeaky new location.
