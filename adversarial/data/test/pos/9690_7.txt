Love, love, love this store! I always find something interesting for myself or others for gifts. In December, she is filled to the brim with lots of teas, coffees, supplies, and even imported sweets. I love that she sells tea bags in little wooden crates, and I love her selection of tea strainers. I have one in the shape of a monkey. :-)
