I still think XS is the best club on the Strip. The staff is nice and not as hostile as the other nightclubs. The promoter got us in with three drink tickets, they actually give you ice water so you don't have to pay $8-10 for bottled water, the crowd seems more well- behaved, mature, and classy here, and the club is gorgeous!
