Eh, it was just alright. The donuts are about on par with Bosa, but they do have the added benefit of offering ice cream in addition to smoothies and coffee drinks. I had a buttermilk donut and a Thai iced tea. The buttermilk donut tasted fresh and had a sweet sugary glaze and soft tender cake. The Thai iced tea was more like Thai iced diabetes (Dia-be-teas?) since it's the most sugar infused version I've ever had! I could only finish about half of the donut and the drink before deciding it wasn't worth the need for metformin in the future.\n\nService was brusque and I had to repeat my order a few times to the cashier, despite only ordering 3 things (2 donuts and the tea).\n\nPrices are decent, but this isn't a place I'll be going out of my way for if I want donuts or a refreshing drink.
