Okay PF you have the big horses outside, trendy decor inside, and a great location! What else you got? Not Chinese food, or if we are going to call it that ... not very good Chinese food. I don't think you could get away with a PF in Richmond Hill so I guess the location helps.\nI was here in the summer with friends and it was very busy! Lots of new customers, lively environment, friendly service but that's it. I like food, good food, so no I will not be coming back to what is to me a glorified Manchu WOK.\nEnjoy your fortune cookies!!!
