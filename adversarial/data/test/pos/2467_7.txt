Y'all, I ordered a BAGEL. AND IT TOOK AN HOUR TO COME OUT. Actually, maybe longer because I'm typing this AS I STILL WAIT FOR MY BAGEL. We got here at 10:45. Ordered at 11. It's now 12:02. I ORDERED A BAGEL.\n\nOur waiter has been very nice. And regularly checks in on us, although he hasn't come by in 15 mins and I think it's out of embarrassment. It's not your fault, Boo.\n\nThe kitchen claims its bc the tickets all came in at once. Okay...get your shit together. An hour for a bagel?????? Good service but I came here primarily for the food.\n\nUPDATE: Finally came out...and it was the last thing TO come out.
