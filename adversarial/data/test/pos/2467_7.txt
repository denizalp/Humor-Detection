I've only been here once, but I definitely was not impressed with the prices. Make sure that you have a clear of current retail and sale prices for the specific models there (especially electronics), since I found that in many cases the savings to be minimal. For the small discount, I would rather brand new and not a refurbished unit. Buyer beware!
