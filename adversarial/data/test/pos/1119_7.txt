Very fast service. The food here is filled with flavour! \n\nThe steak on fries had to have been my favourite loaded fries ever. I highly recommend them but must warn you that you'll be craving them all the time! The philly cheese steak was pretty normal, nothing to be wow'd over, could have used a little more sauce \n\nOverall I'd definitely go back!
