Always super hot, tasty, fresh and cheesy!  They deliver in my area as well and it's a nice change up from pizza!...this is the real thing...they have the \"wiz\" if that is how you prefer it!  It's a bit of a dive, so don't let that scare you...the place has been around for a while.  The fries and sweet tater fries are some of the best around!  Open 24 hours as well is another bonus for those late night munchies...I think I'll head there now!
