This review is from the perspective of someone who found a lost dog. I took her around the neighborhood asking around, posted the info on some lost dog sites, nothing for 3 days, so in we went.\n\nI arrived at about 11am, an hour after they opened, and there was quite a crowded waiting room filled with mostly humans and dogs, plus maybe 2-3 cats. New Years weekend craziness, apparently.\n\nA volunteer told me to grab a number, checked the dog for a chip (nope), got me a leash for the dog, and offered to look the dog up on the lost dog map (already had). The volunteer was the main point of contact in the waiting room - otherwise there was no county employee to answer questions until your number was called. When the volunteer was busy, people were pretty clueless until some friendly souls just told them how things worked. \n\nI waited for 2 hours (again, busy day) before my number was called, in the meantime witnessing the variety of reasons people come in - found pets, lost pets, animal check-ups, adopt a pet, even surrender a pet they could no longer keep (appt only). One family even came in and their dog was there - congrats, guys!\n\nAn employee asked me questions manually at the counter and entered my answers in a computer - took 15 minutes, if only I could have done it myself on a phone or computer while I waited. Then I waited another hour before I got called back to the check-up room, then I could leave. I was there about 3 hours. \n\nI am very thankful to have a place that does the things they do, it just wasn't very efficient that day. My advice is to arrive promptly at 10am when they open to hopefully get in and out.
