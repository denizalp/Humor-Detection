Workday lunch at Noodlecat.  Our food came out pretty fast, which is such a great benefit when grabbing a bite to eat during the lunch hour.  I started out with a Broiled Rice Ball appetizer, which was decent.  The rice ball is cooked just enough to start a little browning on the outside, which actually makes it a little easier to pick at the rice with chopsticks.  I'm not a big fan of putting soy sauce in rice, so my enthusiasm was limited, but overall it's a decent appetizer.  I also tried a piece of the Octopus & Bone Marrow Takoyaki, which was pretty good.  There did not seem to be that much octopus in the piece I had, but the bone marrow was definitely there combined with a little unexpected sweetness from the glaze.\n\nFor the main dish, I went with the Tsukemen Ramen, which is, in one bowl, ramen noodles with some vegetables, pork belly and pork shoulder. In the other bowl is a really fatty pork stock with a sprinkling of sesame seeds.  What you do is take some pork and a bunch of noodles in between your chopsticks, dip it into the stock, and slurp away.  The ramen noodles do a good job picking up the taste of the stock, and the end result is a really great combination--albeit slightly indulgent given the fattiness of the stock.\n\nThe restaurant has a trendy vibe about it--a big change over Teresa's Pizza.  It being only a few days after opening, there was a palpable buzz about most of the diners--the excitement not only of a new restaurant but also the adventure of trying somewhat familiar food (ramen) in a more traditional (and less Cup-O-Noodles-y) way.\n\nAs for minuses, I'm getting more and more used to seeing communal seating, though I'm not crazy about it when seating for one side of the table is against the wall--necessitating people to slide out to let interior people leave the table. Sure, its not a big deal among friends, but can be slightly annoying with strangers.  Also, the fact that they don't have traditional Coke or Pepsi products (the reality being that workday lunch options can't include alcohol) is a major negative for me. I gave the Joe's Cola (or whatever it was called) a try, and I don't feel like paying $4 again for a small bottle of flat and bland cola.  Finally, and I don't mean for this to sound as curmudgeonly as it does, but the service is a little too casual:  Being a good number of years removed from college, I just don't think I'm the server's \"bro\" anymore....\n\nOverall, my initial impression of Noodlecat is a positive one, based heavily on the tastiness of the Tsukemen Ramen.  I'm looking forward to updating the review when they roll out the dinner menu.
