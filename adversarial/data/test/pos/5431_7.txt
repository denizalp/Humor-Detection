Honestly, this place left me speechless. I love that some of the best meals of your life occur not at a fancy, upscale restaurant, but a tiny, unassuming hole-in-the wall. The place is small, there is no restroom, the a\/c may or may not be working, and the floors could use a heavy dose of Pine-Sol. Despite all of that, this place gets 5 stars without hesitation. The food is phenomenal. Unbeatable. Delectable. Tantalizing.  \n\nWe tried a smattering of different foods: za'taar on flatbread, muhammara plate, hummus plate, fool plate, and falafel. The za'taar flatbread is nutty, salty, pipin' hot, and satisfying. The muhammara was sweet, yet spicy, with a terrific combination of spices.  The hummus was some of the best of my life. The chickpeas were well-balanced with the flavors of tahini, lemon, garlic, and olive oil. Topped with another drizzle of olive oil, parsley, and paprika. Just perfect. The fool plate was out of this world. Super lemony. SUPER garlicky. Super fava-beany.  Oh my god, my mouth is watering.  The falafel: fried to perfection.  As if this wasn't enough, our dips came with about 6 pieces of flatbread.  \n\nYou might think this would cost a fortune. Think again. Our total was under $20 bucks and we had leftovers. \n\nFolks, run (actually don't- you'll die from heat stroke) here for your next meal.  Actually, I'm going back tomorrow.
