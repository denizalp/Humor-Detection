I can't believe no one has added this company before me.  They are AMAZING.  They're very accomodating, the first time I found these guys was by pure accident.  I went to my old eyelash technician who just didn't show up even though I waited at reception for over an hour (this was around 6pm).  I ran into Mync asking (more like begging) them if there was any way they could squeeze me in and even though they were closing in 30 minutes one of the technicians stayed behind to do my lashes.    Now i've had my lashes done a lot, I've been to Petals and XtremeLashes but these girls are the absolute BEST in this area. \n\nThe costs are high but worth every dollar.  I did a \"Born Lucky\" and a \"Material Girl\".  A born lucky is $145 and it is 45 lashes per eye, and it was perfect.  When I went for a fill (material girl $90 for 30 lashes per eye) 3 weeks later, Lisa cleaned them up and noticed that my lashes are very weak so she used a different type of lash on me.  That was approx 2 weeks ago and I think maybe 3 have fallen out.  These girls know what they're talking about. In the past I'd pay up to $200 to get them done only to have everything fall out within 2 weeks....no technician ever told me that it was because my lashes were weak and couldn't hold the weight of normal lashes...(why would they every two weeks they'd take 100-200 because I would need a new set not just a fill).  \n\nBtw if you've never had eyelash extensions before they are VERY addictive, the way they change your face is unbelievable.  Obviously its hard to pay $100 every month for lashes but if you can, do it and if you can't do it monthly but can save up for a special occasion I highly suggest you call these ladies....Having eyelash extensions done right is VERY important or you could really damage your lashes and even your eyes....\n\nNo question 5\/5!  LOVE THEM!
