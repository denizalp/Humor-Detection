There was NO wait! None, not just because I had chest pains either, LOL. There were 2 people in the waiting room, I was in in under 10 min, on a Monday morning, which is a notorious\" I need a doctors excuse\" busy day.\n The receptionist was gracious, and Dr Medenhall was really really good. Checked several things, got my meds, and I was off.\n On the way out another guy was whining about paying his bill when it only took under an hour. LOL  Guess they should have made him stick around?
