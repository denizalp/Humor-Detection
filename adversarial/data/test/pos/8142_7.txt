I'm still having a tough time accepting the fact that a unique burger and fries cost between $15 to $18. Regrub is no exception but what makes them different is the use of fresh local ingredients including grassfed beef to make upscale burgers. Better quality, higher price.\n\nI ordered the Mama Mia which the main add-ons are tomato glaze, basil, and Provolone cheese. The basil and tomato glaze were definitely flavorful. I didn't notice the cheese as much despite the fact that it was smothered all over the patty. Maybe the taste was offset by other ingredients? The beef patty was juicy and was definitely not frozen. The brioche buns looked huge but they're really light and fluffy. Overall, it was a flavorful burger despite being small but bigger than Burger 320's.\n\nThe truffle fries were my favorite part of the meal as they were crispy and had a strong cheese smell and taste. Is that what truffles taste like 'cause that was my first time?\n\nI see burgers as comfort food which is why I think Regrub is slightly over-priced. But this place is a good alternative for an upscale burger. At Regrub, you pay for the quality which is shown through every little detail in their burgers. Compared to Burger 320, which has a similar menu and pricing, Regrub wins by a mile. Will be back occasionally when I save enough money from my weekly allowances.
