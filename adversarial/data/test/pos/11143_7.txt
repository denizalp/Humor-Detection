I got tattooed here because it had great reviews and it was convenient. My regular tattoo artist didn't have enough time to give me two tattoos but i really wanted two. I got one from him and got one here. HUGE mistake. it is just frustrating because if the person doesn't think they can do the tattoo they shouldn't say yes. This is permanent, i cant wash it off. Now im stuck with this crappy looking tattoo. I haven't even shown anyone the tattoo since im embarrassed by it. I will post it here for you can see all the things im referring to. The first thing that annoys me is the bottom where it says welcome to miami. The background should be blue but now it looks like patches. its my skin color with pink lettering and blue around it. The c looks smaller than all the other letters. One side is light blue the other is dark blue almost black. one side has a yellow piece by it the other doesn't. The inside of the globe has this dark red and black over the dolphins which looks horrible. the sand should be brown but looks black. I am giving it more time to heal and hopefully the inside of the globe wont look as bad like I got punched a million times. The only good thing about the tattoo is the dolphins and the waves they do look great but everything else looks horrible. The stencil looked awesome but the color and shading is what i dont like. I didn't look until the tattoo was done, I know big mistake. I think if the artist was unsure of what I wanted they should have asked questions. Like hey should I shade in the globe black ? It was pricey which I wouldn't care if I loved the tattoo.\n\n****waiting to see if the shading looks better once it heals will post another picture.
