New rule, never step foot in Guitar Center, the coupons are just tricks to get you in the door... it's like a hooker on Freemont St showing a little boobie, but \"she\" turns out to be a dude with a dick bigger than yours.\n\nGuitar Center is the Walmart of Musical Instruments. They have inflated prices, and poor customer service. This location isn't as bad as the Town Square store down by the Strip, they don't have that wide of a selection as the store on the Strip.\n\nI just throw the coupons in the garbage because even with a coupon, Guitar Centers inflated prices and having to pay 8.1% sales tax I can always find whatever mass produced item they are selling is cheaper online. Now they say they will price match online prices but the sales tax here basically ruins it.\n\nAlso the \"new\" gear on the floor is already beat up by being hammered on by kids every day but it's not in as bad of shape as the instruments at the Town Square store. You might as well buy used gear at that point as their \"new\" floor gear is not new anymore and save yourself the money. Has anyone ever bought things from GC and gotten anything brand new without anything missing anything inside? Aside from the really cheap crap that they sell that is.\n\nUnfortunately there's not any other decent music stores in town other than Cowtown Guitars which specializes in vintage and boutique gear (Something that this store doesn't have at all). I recommend checking out their store if you're into higher end gear or if you're looking for mass produced stuff, try out the gear at Guitar Center and buy the stuff online or buy it used on Craigslist.
