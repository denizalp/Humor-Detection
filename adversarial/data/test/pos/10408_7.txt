This was a huge disappointment. Extremely overpriced in general for AYCE, and to make things worse, the actual food was atrocious. \n\nThe maki rolls dry and untidy. The flavours overall underwhelming. The dim sum offerings tasted previously frozen and reheated. The meat offerings we tried also tasted off, as if they had been frozen or were synthetic and processed. \n\nThe fish itself was fine, no issues with freshness, but based on the rest of our experience, I won't be surprised if I feel sick later. \n\nThe dessert was the saddest part. We ordered the mango, red bean and coconut ice creams and they were served to us as re-frozen melt, we could see a ring of icy water around the bowl and the ice cream itself was soup. Disgusted and will never be returning. \n\nI've had better sushi in a mall food court.
