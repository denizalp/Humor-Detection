No, just no.  They are capitalising on the nearby traffic for business.  No one goes to this place cause the food is bland and the the selection is very limited compared to other chinese buffets...  Why would you settle for 25 bucks for mediocre buffet when you can go to Mandarin.  \n\nService is underwhelming, I've been there 3 times, each time I go there, the waiter rushes and shoves the bill at me, as if I was going to sneak out without paying.  Its not even busy there...\n\nFor the love of god, don't eat any fruits or ice cream, if a waiter see's you with it, he will fly at you with the bill even if its your first item.
