So where are you all staying??\n\nUm, the Wynn.........................................damGrandDesert\n\n\nBesides having that same conversation all weekend, it was fine. It's not far off the strip and the suites are big. Ours was quite stuffy and the (fake\/tacky) flowers were just a hot mess, but who cares. We were comfortable. We took advantage of our friend's family's timeshare so we probably won't be staying there again, but it was fine.
