I had never tasted Turkish cusines until yesterday and I wasn't disappointed. Owner\/chef Ayse Aydemir takes a personal approach to creating and serving authentic Turkish dishes and takes pride in getting one-on-one feedback from the patrons.\n\nWe began with traditionnal Turkish tea served in small glass-like tea cups and a quick lesson on Turkish tea etiquette (see Marie F's review).\n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the Mediterranean salad, which was a wonderful mix of finely chopped vegetables (a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers and sweet onions) in a zesty vinnegrette with olives and feta.\n\nThen it was on to the main course; I ordered the Adana kebab (named after the city in Turkey), which were a spicy mixture of ground beef and lamb over a bed of basmati rice and bulgur. This was served with a side of Domatez Ezmesi (a spicy, fresh blend of finely chopped tomatoes, crisp green peppers, sweet Spanish onions and fresh herbs.) On the whole, a very delicious meal.\n\nOh and if that weren't enough, the home-made bread with humus, which is sprinkled with paprika and a drizzle of olive oil, it to die for.\n\nNext time I won't stuff myself so much so I can try some of their wonderful deserts (I'm looking at you baklava).
