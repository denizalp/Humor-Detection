e by Jose Andres is a unique dining concept where you book online to get a Golden Ticket to a private dining room located in Cosmopolitan's Jaleo restaurant.  They open for business at 5:30pm or 8:30pm, and each time there is room for just six guests.  Its definitely one of the most unique dining experiences we've had, with a team of chef\/artists\/chemists preparing over 20 small dishes over the span of 90 minutes.  \n\nIt was so fun to watch and be able to interact with the chefs throughout the night.  As for the dishes themselves, I'm rating 4 stars overall.  Many dishes were mind-blowingly good and can only be dreamt up by a genius chef.  Some dishes tended to use too many cold (liquid nitrogen) ingredients that we did not care for.  There's also a heavy use of foie gras among the ingredients.\n\nOur favorite dishes:\n* This Dungeness crab served in its shell with a rich crab broth\n* Wonder Bread - a brilliant mini PB&J sandwich with lemony meringue bread and foie gras jelly\n* Braised Beef Cheeks - amazingly tender and served with liquid-filled potato gnocchi\n* This walnut-themes dessert with raspberries.  They claimed walnut prepared four ways!\n* Cotton-candy empanadas filled with foie gras\n* This asparagus dish with foamy goodness and caviar\n\nLeast favorite dishes\n* Edible Sangria - gives you brain freeze and seems really tart.  \n* I liked the seared fluke itself, but found the minced pork and sauce around the plate to be a bit salty.\n\nDefinitely a fun experience, and I recommend it if you enjoy watching your meal created in front of you and for interacting with the chefs.  The vast majority of the 20+ dishes are quite good, though its unlikely everyone will like the same things.
