Friends.... \n\nI referred to this bar on a previous review of the AWESOME Brew Kettle, so I feel I must address it... ugh \n\nI have avoided this review for so long because I cant get over my ANGER about it. \n\nI have been reviewing for a bit of time and have a few cherished friends on the Yelp service ...not an elite guy.. just someone who loves Yelp, and uses it when I travel and always at home also. Yelp has been an agent to many many good times...so I want to give it back. \n\nSo I feel I should not be so rank and angry to the point of becoming a cartoon of myself., and that is why I have avoided posting this review. \n\nI still avoid it today by being vague, I will give you a clue as to how FUCKING PISSED I AM. \n\nI live 1 mile from it \nThey have great beer and very very good wings \nThey are a bit pricey for Lakewood \nThe unit is very well built...nice layout ... slick \nThe service is the WORST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN MY  LIFE \n\nI HAVE RUN RESTAURANTS FOR 20 PLUS YEARS AND IF ANYONE TREATED MY CUSTOMERS THE WAY I HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY TREATED AFTER 5 OR MORE VISITS ... AFTER TALKING TO THE MANAGER ( WHO TOLD ME HE WAS SORRY BUT THOSE SERVERS WHO TREATED US LIKE CRAP WERE HIS BEST...HERE IS A FREE BEER...THEN THE NEXT TIME WE RETURN THEY ARE STILL THERE AND TREAT US THE SAME W\/O HIM THERE) \nI WOULD FIRE THEM SO FAST THAT A GOD DAMN BREEZE WOULD FOLLOW THEM THROUGH THE  BACKDOOR AS THEY RAN FROM THE JOINT WITH LAST CHECK IN POCKET!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nWell.... sorry for the caps ..\n\nBut the service is so OVER-THE-TOP-HORRIBLE ... I FELT LIKE A RUBE FOR PAYING MY BILL EACH TIME I WENT!!! \n\nI will detail my experiences on an update...just needed to say this today. \n\nSorry to be this angry, but I cant find another place that treats anyone that is not a \"hot\" , \"young\" \"dude\" or \"babe\" like they are INVISIBLE until now... we AVERAGE PEOPLE made up the most of the crowd, but received very little service. \n\nAnd no..... I would not stand at Studio 54, in 1980, hoping to get past the velvet rope... perhaps they should have a fucking velvet rope at the BBE so that those customers whom the waitresses find  too pedestrian will not throw money at a business that will not respect them!!!!!!! \n\nYou embarrass all of us who are in the service business ... \nI wish you could rate -1\n\nOUT
