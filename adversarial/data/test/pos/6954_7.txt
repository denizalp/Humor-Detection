I went this morning, on one of those Teambuy coupon cut, wash, style deals.\nwouldn't have known about the place otherwise.\n\ni was nervous about going after reading some neg reviews elsewhere.  wish i saw yelp's comments, first.  (http:\/\/www.chickadvisor.com\/store\/sugar-n-spice-studios\/).  I had a senior stylist, Catherine - who was pleasant, professional, and I was happy with the results.\n\nscalp massage (during the shampoo) that other yelpers are referring to, too, was def. appreciated.\n\nproducts seem good as well\/of quality.  \nnice girly-girl decor.  n of Queen, east of Bathurst.  easy to find, right beside Muraille Theatre.\n\ni'm into low maintenance cuts (and also I'm trying to grow my hair), so i don't know if i'd fork over $60 anywhere for a cut.  (more than once, anyway).  but for that voucher price, i'm feeling pretty pretty happy right now.
