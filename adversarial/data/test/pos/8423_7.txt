I don't seem to recall having been to a BBB that was inside the mall like this. Because it's not their usual footprint, the store seemed especially crowded and claustrophobic as it still felt like the full inventory. Still, we walked the aisles and looked for interesting home tidbits, not finding anything that really shouted \"buy me!\"\n\nWhat they did have was everything you could possibly need for your home, from small appliances to bed linens, kitchen knives to shower curtains. Everything but major appliances and food. The range of brands goes from inexpensive to nearly top notch.\n\nTip: Sign up for their customer list and you'll get a 20% off coupon every month.
