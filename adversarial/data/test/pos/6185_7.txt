The Good - Plush red velvet walls and seats inside, beautiful waterfall with a light mist to cool you off outside, no cover if you're on the guestlist, clean bathrooms, nice staff, enough room on the dance floor to groove\n\nThe Bad - expensive drinks, nowhere to sit unless you buy bottle service, dj plays good songs but cuts them off after 30 seconds\n\nThe Ugly - skin tight dresses were not made to be worn by everyone\n\nOverall a good time, but I don't feel like I have to rush back any time soon.
