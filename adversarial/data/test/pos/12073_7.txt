Tao is a foreign word, which loosely translates to \"panty-dropper.\"  Wait a minute, it doesn't?  Those guys lied to me? \n\nJake, a really cool promotions guy, approached Lindsey and I on the street early last Saturday and asked if we wanted to get VIP entrance into Tao at 10 pm and have an open bar.  So, after thinking about this for 2 nanoseconds, we eagerly agreed.  We had dinner reservations at Tao for 11 pm, and figured that we could have a few free drinks before being seated downstairs. \n\nAfter calling Tao to confirm that our promoter was legit (although I wasn't too concerned, since Mama taught me how to disable taillights when trapped inside a predator's trunk), Lindsey and I brought our sexy selves to the Girl's Only VIP line.  We received our wristbands and were quickly ushered in - past at least one hundred clubgoers in waiting (some people wait all night and are never permitted entry).  \n\nAt one of the bars (there are 3 on the main level and a few on \"the beach\" upstairs) the bartender sadly informed me that the best I could get with my free drink wristband is a Skyy and Red Bull.  Expecting a slap in the face from my high-maintenance friends, instead, he received squeals of delight.  Obviously, he isn't aware that we're girls who prefer top shelf but are just as happy shotgunning beers at a tailgate party.\n\nAfter a delicious dinner at Tao (review to follow) we effortlessly re-entered the club upstairs.  There are three dance areas:  The large one on the main floor, one in a side room, and one upstairs at \"the beach.\"  Beware of the single man that groups of guys send out to find cute girls and drag back to their table lair caveman style.\n\nBeing in a female-only group (although a male co-worker of mine was running around this place like a kid in a candy store) allowed us to receive the ultimate VIP treatment at this sexy \"see and be scene\" club.  It's nice having men in suits repeatedly request your presence at their special tables & VIP rooms with curtains - but not when the men's faces resemble that SNL skit where cousins breed with each other and spawn deformed offspring.  Also, the married men who were there to prove they \"still got it\" proved to be a little trying.  Come on, guys, do you think that we don't notice you keeping your left hands in your pockets, excusing yourselves to the restroom, coming back and gesturing with a tan-lined finger?  NiceGirl rule #84:  Don't do the nasty with guys who are taken.  Period.\n\nNote: the restrooms are marked \"Yin\" and \"Yang.\"  A little tipsy, I mistakenly wandered into the Yin room and saw a guy's Yang.  Not advisable (unless timed strategically after consuming copious amounts of high-proof liquor).\n\n\nMy favorite part?  \"The Beach\" upstairs.  Poolside setting (which is actually a hot place for sun and fun during the day), sexy environment, and a cool breeze to help you feel relaxed.\n\nThe motto of this Asian-inspired place is, \"Always a Happy Ending.\"   Wow, that's gutsy.  Take with this what you like, but right around 4 am, Lindsey and I were forced to make a hasty retreat when the lights slightly brightened and the 4 am \"bed partner\" scramble began.  \nSorry dudes, we don't care if you do play for the Giants or really make that much money.  This is Vegas - everyone is a star.
