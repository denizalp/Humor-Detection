I got take-out from CherryBlossom tonight.  I was getting a pedicure next door and Helen, who does a FABULOUS job on my toesies, told me to try the Pad Thai.\nI was greeted as soon as I walked in the door.  There were 3 choices:  chicken, shrimp and\/or tofu.  I got the shrimp\/tofu Pad Thai.\nAs I sat down, I realized I was sitting next to the biggest jerk\/douche EVER!  He must have been on a date and I felt *really* sorry for the really pretty girl with the foreign accent sitting with him.  His cell rang AND HE ANSWERED IT!  In a restaurant!  his schnoz rivaled Seinfeld's.  He even got angry that their server came by and left because he was on the phone.  She told them it was policy not to disturb.  Fine enough!   Seriously, if I were sitting to eat next to him and not just waiting for take-out, I would have requested another table.  He bugged me THAT much.\nIt didn't take more than 10 minutes for me to get my food.  Got home, it was still piping hot.  Generous portion of shrimp and TONS of crushed peanuts.  Yummy!  The sauce had a nice sweet\/tang to it.  I saved half to eat later.  Or tomorrow, but it was so good, that I will probably eat it later tonight.  It was a little over $10 with tax.  Not bad for two meals!
