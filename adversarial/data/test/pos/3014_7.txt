This place is Da Bomb! Okay that was super cheesy and super 90s, but there are no other words to express how delicious this place is. \n\nFive stars purely because their roast duck, & roast pork is freaking amazinggggg. It is seriously one of the best roast ducks I've ever had (and I'm Chinese American, so that's a lot of roast duck I've eaten in my lifetime). \n\nOther dishes: the shrimp dumpling soup was okay (I've had better), and honestly I don't remember anything else we ordered bc I was having a duckgasm. (That might be flagged for inappropriate content, sorry Yelp).\n\nThe restaurant itself is kinda small, seats maybe 50. There's a long table in the back with maybe 10-12 seats, and you have to squeeze by them to get to the bathrooms. But i kinda love the restaurant's small size because it feels like an awesome neighborhood joint. \n\nThis place gets busy and stays busy. My party of four went at 2pm on a Saturday and we didn't have to wait bc we took the last open table. The party that walked in behind us had to wait a few min (10min) for a table to open up. \n\nthe service is also pretty good! Nice servers, came by often to refill our drinks, clear away empty dishes, got us our specific requests promptly, etc.
