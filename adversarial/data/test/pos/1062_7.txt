I've been coming here for several years now.  Always get a DEEP massage that works out any knots, aches and pains, etc.  The staff is friendly and informative!\n\nI do have a specific incident where Toronto Bodyworks seriously SAVED ME though!  Couple years ago I was at a friend's pool party, jumping in and out of the water like a fool and having a great time.  As the party wrapped up, I went to move a lawn chair....A LAWN CHAIR... all of 3 lbs!.... and somehow managed to pinch a nerve between my shoulder blades.  This caused every muscle in my neck to seize up to the point where I couldn't move my head at all without experiencing severe pain.  In other words, I was in trouble!!\nI promptly visited a doctor who gave me muscle relaxants, etc, but she also highly recommended a deep massage.  I immediately booked an appointment with Bodyworks and was in there the next day.\nLet me just say that after this massage, I felt 90% better.  I mean, I went from not being able to turn my head 1cm, to having a few inches in range of motion, instantly!  Also a lot of the pressure in the damaged area was gone.  They recommended some stretches and gave me some great advice on how to avoid this type of injury in the future.\n\nNeedless to say that I was in a desperate situation before this massage.  I felt as though I had done serious, permanent damage to my neck prior to coming here.  I never realized I could get that much relief, so quickly.  Kudos to Toronto Bodyworks!\n\nPeople should also know though, that this is not a spa.  This is a no-frills therapeutic massage establishment.  If what you're looking for is an intense massage that actually benefits you, then look no further!
