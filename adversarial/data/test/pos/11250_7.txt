TLDR: Pacific has their share of good choices at the buffet, but it's the quality of the food is pretty average. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty clean and has a pretty calm environment. Once you sit down at your table you can start getting food right away. Some of the best things that they have to offer is the noodle bar (choose your noodles, meats, veggies and they cook it fresh for you), kalbi short ribs, and ice cream bar. \n\nThey have a sushi bar and the workers are constantly making new sushi items because it's one of the more popular things that people get there. In terms of quality though, the sushi is pretty bottom tier. They have some sashimi, but they're cut so small that you'd need to grab 3-5 of them to equal a normal sashimi slice at any real sushi restaurant. \n\nBut you don't come here for their quality of sushi or the freshness of food. You come here to stuff your face with average food that would otherwise cost a lot of money if it weren't in a buffet.
