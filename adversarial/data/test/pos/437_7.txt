Filed under fancy plate Pittsburgh. It might have taken me four years to get here, but I finally made it on a Wednesday evening looking for something casual but impressive for my NYC companion. While I wasn't crazy excited to tell everyone to get here ASAP, it was still great. For as much food boom as we're having here, it's hard to find items outside of brussel sprouts and pork belly (although they do have both here too!).\nThe place itself is small and intimate, so luckily we were one of three or four tables.  We grabbed the window booth (which are screened so you don't have that weird passerby looking at your table thing going on--yaknow?) and listened to a hoard of frantic specials I can't remember. Overall, dinner mate thought it was \"brilliant,\" while I thought it was good enough for me.\n\nStarted with two lavender gin cocktails, which I expected to be flowery corpse reviver (lillet was included!), but received more of a mild purple gimlet.. That isn't necessarily a complaint, just different! My colleague had about five negronis (negrono?) so I can only assume they were delicious.\n\nI tried brussel sprouts.. They were roasted in a vegan wine sauce and tasted like spring rolls. Tiny bowl. I ate 'em all. Luckily it was small because I then moved onto a huge vegan meatloaf.  I've also never had meatloaf (look at me, wild and crazy) as a non-beef eater but I'll assume this was close.  It was highly recommended to me so I was a little disappointed when it was just OK. Layered with asparagus and a light \"almond cheese\", I was a fan. A bit dry? I was kind of into it. Everyone who is a regular eater would probably think it's a bit odd.  Dinner mate had a super pretty plate of real cow that he was very impressed by. I'm a sucker for sauce dots and swirls and all that frou frou stuff (read: yinzer goes to dinner somewhere other than D's sixpax).\n\nThis is the most underrated spot of all the Pittsburgh restaurant boom. Root 147 deserves a majillion more accolades than the Penn Ave joints, but I think it's getting lost in East Regent Jabip or just that it's been around now for a whole four or five years. It's really worth it to cross Fort Frick Park for these fancy lil' plates.
