This is a great branch Library. Very new and clean. My favorite part about the Maricopa Libraries is their online catalog. When you go online to www.mcldaz.org you will have access to the entire county's  inventory of movies and books. I like to go online and request movies and books for pickup. I get an email when they are ready. Then all I need to do is go and pick them up. \n\nThey have a great selection in their building everyday. And I appreciate a section called Friends of the Library where books are for sale for $0.50-1.00.
