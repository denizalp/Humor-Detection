I don't know about now, but when I bought my car there 15 years ago, they were amazing. I was fresh out of college, moved to a new state with no friends\/support. I needed a car and they gave me exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted, no haggling or games. They even let me ask around after saying yes to my request - just because they knew that I would come back. They were right - every other dealer laughed at me and one even yelled at me - I wish I could remember which one so that I could write a review.\n\nThis was my first car that I purchased and the sales manager made it a great experience. I no longer live in OH but if I did, I would go back there as they were so good to me 15 years ago - hopefully the same people are still around, although judging by the reviews maybe not?
