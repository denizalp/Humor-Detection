I have not eaten at the Longhorn, from what other reviewers have stated it does seem like an incredible bargain.  Steak dinner for 5 bucks? Only in Vegas.\n\nI stopped by the Longhorn Casino on a Friday night.  I heard from my friend Sara that there were some incredible drink deals to be had, dollar Coronas, dollar shots, etc.. I thought to myself, I can probably spend a lot of time here boozing for sure..\n\nAs we parked, Sara mentioned that my clothes would probably stink of cigarette smoke after going in the Longhorn.  I wasn't surprised, I tend to expect cigarette smoke anytime I'm in Vegas, it goes hand in hand.  \n\nUpon entering the Longhorn, I was surprised at how small it was, and the fog like smokey haze fueled by chain-smoking gamblers.  I could tell this place was going to be cheap but dive as hell.\n\nThe bar area was small and absolutely packed with locals, and I noticed a TINY stage area behind the bar where Sara said there was a live one man band performer.  The bartender was quick with the drinks, poured generously with the tequila shots and gave us some sass for being from Novato.\n\nWe wandered out of the crowded bar area with our drinks and boozed by the slot machines.  One of the locals, who appeared to be wasted (at 8:00pm) came over to us and started exercising her charms on Sara.  \n\nRegardless of how smokey and crowded it was, it was a totally fun experience.  Lots of interesting characters at this place for sure.  And just in general I think local casinos are more interesting places to visit than some of the casinos on the strip.\n\nEventually we felt the need to leave, smoke was too intense.  But I encourage anyone in the area to go and get the \"Vegas Experience\".
