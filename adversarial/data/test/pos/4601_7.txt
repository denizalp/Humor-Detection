They still stand out in the walkway with a platter of samples, mostly trying to lure the lemmings out of the line to jump off the Mc-Cliff next door.\nThey landed me with an unbarbed, straight hook (a toothpick) and some tastey bait made up of bread, chicken, cheese, bacon, and some sort of sauce.\nI didn't even ask the name, I just said I wanted whatever that chick is giving out, and a few minutes later I was eating a giant sized version of the teaser.  \nApparently their specialty is the philly cheese steak style sammiches, but I'm not sure I'd try anything new for a while this sammy was s ogood, unless the platter chick is out fishing again with some new bait!
