This place is trouble. I could be in here for hours! I love this location the best by far. It's very clean and organized so makes it easy to shop. In the decor section, both of the end isles are clearance sections and you can get some good things here. Great place to purchase good price clothes, shoes, home decor, kid items, and gifts. I always come here when giving my friends\/family gifts because I can get a cute gift basket and fill it with miscellaneous stuff they will enjoy for a good price. \n\nThe customer service here is excellent as well. They always have a good amount of registers open so you don't have to wait long to check out even during the holidays when it gets busy. They are always restocking and getting new shipments so you can go frequently but still see new items. \n\nGreat place to shop for good prices! Highly recommend (:
