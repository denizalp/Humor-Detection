My boyfriend and I used to come here at least twice a week because of the great coupons that the M Resort would send out each month. They still send out coupons but now instead of buy one and get one free, it $5.00 off your purchase. It's still a good deal, though, since most of their items like their sandwiches are between $9.99 and $11.99.\n\nIt is located inside the M Resort and we decided to eat here after doing a little bit of gambling. I wasn't having much luck at the poker machines and figured I would do better on a full stomach. We both ordered the footlong Nathan hot dog, Chicago style, which was $4.99 each. I always scrape off the onions but eat everything else. We've ordered the hot dog before and sometimes the bun falls apart but it didn't happen on this occasion which was a plus!\n\nThis place also has desserts and I believe the desserts are from Baby Cakes... we almost got a cookie but I'm trying to be good... I had a lot of sweets earlier in the day.\n\nBy the way, the wait for the food is never long. You order and pay the cashier and wait for your number to be called. I think the longest I ever had to wait was 15 minutes but that was on a very busy afternoon and we ordered a whole pizza.\n\nThe cashiers here are always so friendly and it is always the same three ladies that I see every time I come in.
