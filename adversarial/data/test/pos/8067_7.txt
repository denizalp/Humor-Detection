Having plans for a show on a Friday is never easy, I get home from work, say my hellos, change my clothes, fix the face and hair. By this time I'm starving, time feels like it's flying by. We had plans to eat at a particular place but that fell through so Yelp came in handy once again. Let's eat at Culinary Dropout, we're going to the Hard Rock so it's convenient, I made a reservation just in case. \nSo we got there about 7:30 and the place was busy but suprised to see alot of open tables (probably because it's such a big space). Seated by the kitchen, I got to watch the action. Everyone of the staff were working their butt off but it looked smooth and cohesive at the same time. \nNow I grew up eating pierogi, when bought costing about 50 cents a piece. I can't believe I spent 11$ on 3 pierogi! But they were so good, loved the little cauliflower bits, don't tell mom but I'd do it again! We also got the Prime Rib Dip with Chips and Onion Dip, also really good. I wish we had more time to grub out but we had a show to get to. \nOur waitress was great, loved the atmosphere. I can't wait to go back, I have my 11$ ready!
