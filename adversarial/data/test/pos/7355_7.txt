Dr. Keith you are always wonderful to us. \nYour front office staff however, what is going on there? \nI walked in with my 16 year old and my 10 year old and I said \"hello\" to the front office lady, she said nothing the other cute girl at the front also said nothing. Granted, I get it- they are busy, it seems- AND...\nThen more loud I said \"HELLO,\" again and then they looked up and said \"hello.\" I am continuously baffled by the lack of costumer care, politeness, simple gestures and greetings... There is no wonder why businesses fail when quality greetings and costumer care is missing. \n\nWhen you walk into a Doctors office the first greeting is always the lasting impression.
