I went here expecting a really great meal based on the yelp reviews, but honestly I wasn't too thrilled overall with my meal .  I feel like I went to a totally different restaurant than the reviewers.  I've been to many similar \"Churrascaria\" Brazilian restaurants in many places and this was one of the worst I've experienced.  As far as Las Vegas goes, I have been to the one at Planet Hollywood (Pampas something?) and Mirage (Samba) as well. \n\nFirst of all, what is with the 1000 people that work there, seems fairly overstaffed for this type of restaurant.  I found it very odd that the hostess asked for my full first name and last name and phone number, then had a long speech about how much the food cost and a long run through about what exactly we'd be eating.  It annoyed me and I interrupted her to get her to shut up and seat us at our table.  Then, a waiter came to get our drink orders and again, attempted to explain to us the same thing that the hostess did.  \n\nFor the actual food itself, the meat they served my husband and I was raw.  Not medium rare as the waiter described was how they served the meat and how I prefer to eat it, just not cooked at all inside.  I'll happily eat rare meat but this wasn't even at that level.  I ate around the sides of the beef where it was cooked a little, and because it was so undercooked I was too scared to try to chicken and pork because I thought it might be raw too and kill me.  Yes, I know they cook the meat for you if you ask, but when we asked for meat that was cooked, they sliced off some pieces and put it back on the fire, which eliminated the flavor of the meat and still wasn't so good.\n\nAlso, I had a problem with some of the seasoning, or lack of it.  With the exception of the signature steak and the garlic sirloin, nothing seemed to be properly seasoned and was very bland.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving this place two stars and not one was the bananas they serve with the meal, they were probably my favorite thing in the meal.  Also, most of the salad bar was pretty good.  I liked the lobster bisque, and it had a lot of flavor, but was sad there were no little chunks of lobster in it.  It made me wonder what the restaurant did with the actual lobster, since the soup was flavored with stock and there was no servings of lobster anywhere.  So I just assumed they did not make the soup in house, and got sad at that conclusion, since the rest of the salad bar seemed fresh.\n\nI don't think I'd go here again, but as far as choices for this type of food I don't think any of the Brazilian Churrascaria restaurants in Vegas are really that good (Samba was my favorite years ago, but now has gone downhill), so I couldn't recommend an alternative.
