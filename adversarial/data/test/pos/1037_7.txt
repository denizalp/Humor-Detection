In the middle is all I got for Marigold Maison. I had major high hopes when choosing a restaurant last week after a busy week of travel. We arrived about 820pm on a Friday night and were promptly sat. I noticed right off that the waitress didn't allow us any time to look at the drink menu before asking us what we would like; she tried to get our order as soon as she sat us while we had the menus in our faces. It always takes me a minute to peruse a menu and I truly don't like someone hovering while I do it. Add tired and the first opp for me and my husband to relax and enjoy a moment out together and that becomes a bit worse. Since she returned to hover in about a minute, I just ordered a white wine. She wanted to take our meal order then, to which we both chuckled, that was gonna be a few minutes , ( hint to back off for seven!).  We considered doing the Tour of India at 24pp , as it seemed a way to sample all things .. BUT also maybe way too much food! We started with the Lentil Crepe and Paneer Pakora. Both were tasty! We also wanted two Naan breads: Garlic and Mirchi... we could have done one! They are hand stretches and big! The Mirchi was spicy with actual sprinklings of chile on top. The garlic was divine! For dinner we did a Classic Curry with chicken and Malai Kofta , a vegetarian dish made of dumplings in a creamy sauce of saffron , almond and cashew. We loved each dish but the service was rushed and that was not okay. It was a Friday night and we didn't arrive late. The bill was brought to us while we were in the middle of enjoying our mains and no offer of another wine was made. We continued to ask for water. No offer of dessert and it left us feeling as though we made a mistake coming up to PV to try Marigold Maison out. The patio was still full of diners and I was confused by the rush. We paid; we left and decided to go else where to finish our Friday night date :)
