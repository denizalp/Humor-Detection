(1) You played House with Hip Hop. You already win in my book.\n(2) The fact that you have ample seating for the people that didn't spend a thousand plus dollars on table service is awesome.\n(3) You have a flipping pool too?! EVEN BETTER.\n(4) You mean...I can go outside and breathe? Have fresh air? Not be stuck in a stuffy club. WHOAAA.\n\nSteve Wynn, you are a genius.
