YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(200\/365) \"Jin's Chocolate Treasures\"\n\nJinJu translates to \"Pearl\" in Korean, and the treasures available in Chef Jin Caldwell's\nshop in the Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas are some of THE BEST your tastebuds will ever come across! Seriously...\n\nEver since I can remember, Jin's level of professionalism and passion has always been at the highest level possible-from working with her at Bellagio, and watching her career flourish at Wynn, and later, at Ethel M in Henderson as Master Chocolatier. Ten years later, JinJu Chocolates are her labor of love, and continue to attract fans after every orgasmic bite.\n\nAs much as I wanted to grab one of everything in the store, I restrained myself and went with and 8-piece box of the Berry Mascarpone, Tropical, Mint Chocolate, Bacon Stout, Fig and Red Wine, Matcha, Espresso Crunch, and PB &J.  We also added a couple of Peanut Butter Cups, Chocolate Covered Gummy Worms, and some Caramel Turtles, oh and after sampling the Almond Dragees, a bag of those too. $35 for all of this was not a bad deal at all either! A couple of complimentary Chocolate covered pretzel sticks made its way into our bag, and the girl behind the counter was nice enough to give us an ice pack for our chocolates as we mentioned that we were gonna be outdoors. What service!\n\nBottom line, the quality of ingredients used paired with Jin's expertise makes Jinju Chocolates one of the most highly sought out in town. What are you waiting for? GETCHOASSOVAHEA!!!!!   ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5\n\n*Cards are accepted here, but have cash handy as the electronic payment system is kinda spotty and doesn't always work(all shops operate on the same system)
