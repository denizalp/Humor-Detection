I've never been so intrigued and cheered up by a store before. \n\n\nThis place is so...miscellaneous, so I'll try to break it down.\n\nCandy: A wall of Haribo products that I didn't even know existed, a long with a boatload of other sweets that I haven't seen since childhood. Major nostalgia points.\n\nToys: A variety of faux fireworks, like 'snakes', sparklers, or those things that pop when you slam them on the sidewalk. Nothing mind blowing except the selection and arrangement, which gives you strong impulses to purchase them all and go on a rampage of immaturity.\n\nBooks: Made me LOL more than anything else. My buddy picked up Postsecret for only $12, and as I perused the books, one stood out. It was by some author by \"Mr. Pottymouth\" and had some crude drawing on the cover with contents that may or may not be appropriate for a Yelp review.\n\nRecords: A decent selection of 70s and 80s music. I picked up a Rick James vinyl for $2. It said \"special prize inside!\" and when I poured out the contents there was a condom. Queue immediate laughter.\n\nOne day, I'm going on a shopping spree to recreate a long summer day of my childhood. There will be lots of little knicknacks flying around and popping in every direction, while my parents listen to music from the days they were allegedly cool. Another Yelper described this place as a \"yard sale\"...I wish yard sales could be this awesome!
