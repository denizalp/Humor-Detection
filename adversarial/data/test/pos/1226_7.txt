I came here for an event on Friday evening, which was phenomenal! I was happy with the space, although it did have that musty old-church smell. It wasn't overly large, but beautiful - I loved the wrap around balcony, although we opted to sit at the front, behind the orchestra. The stairs going to the basement were quite old & steep, and there was only one (TINY) bathroom. Nice little area downstairs, room for a few tables and a small bar. The parking situation wasn't great, but I couldn't complain because we managed to find a \"celebrity parking\" stall right out front. I love old churches, and this one definitely fit the bill. Personally, I would return here for another event - but I wouldn't get married here.
