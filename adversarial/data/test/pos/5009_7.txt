My second favourite Value Village (#1 being the Blansdowne location)! There isn't a huge selection of furniture and home accessories at this location, but what it lacks for in home decor it more than makes up for in scarves and sewing notions. I've purchased scads of NEW, never-before-opened sewing patterns from the 70s and 80s here as well as entire bags of buttons, zippers, and stitch witchery for mere pennies.\n\nToday's bargain find was CDs. YES - CDs!! Once I scanned past the twenty copies of Backstreet Boys' \"Millennium\" and Hilary Duff's Greatest Hits (what?), I snagged these, in great condition and $2.99 each:\n\nKoop - Waltz For Koop\nThe Pernice Brothers - Yours, Mine & Ours\nAugie March - Strange Bird\nMomus - Otto Spooky\nBran Van 3000 - Glee**\n\n**one of the most underrated albums of all time. A backup copy.
