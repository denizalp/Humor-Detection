I'm sure I'm not the only one to consistently quote Major League every single time the Cleveland Indians are brought up in conversation. Is it juvenile? Sure. Do I do it anyway? Oh yes. \n\nProgressive Field is a solid park. It's decently laid out, nicely landscaped and the food and beverage offerings are pretty solid. Varying brands of beer, encased meats, sodas, sports drinks, treats, etc. It's definitely worth noting that you should absolutely look closely in the frozen coolers for Mitchell's ice cream - a local brand that is out of this world. Just be aware of the prices...like many parks, Progressive will turn your pockets inside out if you're the least bit hungry. A stuffed cup of Mitchell's will run you $8. That's cold. \n\nDuring busy weekends or nights, parking can be a little bit of a hassle around the ballpark, so plan accordingly. Forget about the curve ball Ricky, give him the heater!
