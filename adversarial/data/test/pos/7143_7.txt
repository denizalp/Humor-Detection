good fish and chips but certainly not the amazing delight that I was expecting due to the flamboyant reviews I have received from word of mouth. I trekked very far to main station to experience the \"best fish and chips I'll ever have\" and I am critically disappointed. The waiter forgot our drinks (a coke and iced tea, not that hard) which I don't understand seeing as they had about a 1-1 staff ratio for the other people in there. I ordered the halibut and chips (or maybe it was haddock, whatever, its all fish) as did my friend. We found our meal to be good, but not even close to the godly praise that it was given by several people whom I thought had good taste. Such godly praise is deserved by deep-blue fish and chips, who seem to have disappeared off the face of the earth (RIP). I would rank the food here good-average, its not bad but its certainly not above and beyond. I think I slightly preferred the fish and chips at the old nick pub on the danforth due to them serving it with tartar sauce, other than this they would be about the same in quality.\n\nso unless you live nearby I would recommend just going to the nearest pub or other fish and chips place.
