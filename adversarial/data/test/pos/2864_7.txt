My family and I are in Cleveland for the weekend and we're looking for a nice casual place to eat with good food (obviously). My mother got a recommendation from the hotel concierge for Bricco, which was two blocks down the street. I'm not sure if the hotel gets a kick-back for the recommendation, but please think twice before going to Bricco.The menu reads fantastic, but don't be fooled. I would love to see this menu at a place that cared more about tasting good rather than sounding good. \n\nI checked out the other reviews and followed their advice. No duck. No calamari. Stick with the pizza. Try the veal. Have a caesar salad to start. \n\nWe asked the waitress how big the pizzas were in case we wanted to share with each other. This was the response:\n\"Well, we can cut it in 4, 6, or 8 pieces\"\nI'm sorry... what!?!? Did you just tell me that the SIZE of the pizza I'm about to order depends on the number of slices you cut it into? \nObviously she didn't pass fractions class in middle school. My two little bros, who are in 7th and 9th grade, were making fun of her just as bad as the adults. So if she didn't pass fractions, then did she pass properties of circles class? \nMy mom asks, \"What would you say the diameter of the pizza is?\"\nThe response?\n\"Medium.\"\nOh, this is just putting fuel on the fire of laughter at the table. \n\nI know that a restaurant's review shouldn't depend solely on the waitstaff since other patrons may not have the same server, but I think you can understand I needed to get that out (that and the fact my mom was annoyed because the waitress kept calling her 'sweetheart').\n\nOn to the food...\n\nWe got the garlic bread and a caesar salad to share on the table. The garlic bread wasn't very garlic-y, possibly because the bread is topped with tomatoes and tons of cheese. I wouldn't recommend this if you're craving that garlic sensation. I wouldn't recommend the caesar salad either. The dressing was drowning the salad (horrible for the calorie conscience) and didn't taste great to boot. \n\nI got the veal parm entree which comes with linguini. It was a good portion and was pretty tasty. So if you are going to Bricco then just get this and save the risk of something else. My youngest brother got the salmon with orzo. Salmon wasn't bad, a little over seasoned, but the orzo lacked any real flavor. My other brother got shrimp linguini in alfredo sauce. The alfredo sauce was very thick, and you only get FOUR shrimp, but my brother liked it nonetheless. My step-father got a veggie pizza with mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes, onions. My mother got a tomato, basil, and mozzerella pizza. The same complaint for both was the first piece is good when the pizza crust is still crispy. After the first slice, the oil makes the crust extremely soggy and very difficult to eat. The pizza comes in 4 slices, so take our waitress's advice and get it cut into 8 slices. WARNING: THIS WILL NOT CHANGE THE SIZE OF YOUR PIZZA\n\nRestaurant itself was very nice and clean. Presentation was not their downfall. \n\nPass on Bricco, read some other reviews, and find the other hidden gems in Cleveland. \n\nUntil next time, happy eating!
