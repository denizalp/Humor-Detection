If you're looking for something other than Cirque Du Soleil, Human Nature is a great choice.\n\nThese four men from Australia do a fantastic job of preserving the Do-Wop style of singing and not only do they sing the classics, but they throw in a salute to famous boy bands and a few current hits too.\n\nOverall, a great show with feel good vibes throughout the entire show...definitely worth checking out whether you are a local, or even visiting from out of town.
