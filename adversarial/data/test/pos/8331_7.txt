I don't even know how to begin writing this review.  How about by saying that this may very well have been the best meal I've ever had.  And I'm a summer\/winterlicious FIEND.  \n\nI was making plans to go to Tarragon theatre with a friend, and looked at my (extensive) Yelp bookmarks to see what was in the area.  Corner House was the only one, so I took a look at the website, where I discovered their $35 fixed-price menu that they have from 5:30-6:30 Tues-Sat.  But then I read the options.  My mouth watered.  I knew I had to go.\n\nIt didn't work out to go the night of the theatre, but I found someone to go with me the very next week.  The plan was to meet at 6:30 (the earliest that I would be able to arrive after work).  I got held up, turned around, and ended up being a half hour late.  We were still offered the fixed price menu, for which I was very grateful.  \n\nWe made the quick decision to order different things and share them so that we could get a true taste of as many items as possible.  For starters, I ordered the shrimp and she the tartar.  There were only three shrimp in the dish, but they were very large and so perfectly cooked that I didn't mind.  The sauce they were in was to die for, and I nearly did when I realized that there was a piece of crusty bread at the bottom of the bowl soaking up all that goodness.  The tartar was absolutely delicious as well.  It was like a very flavourful sashimi.  And the sauce that came with it - divine.  \n\nThe entrees we chose were the flat iron steak and the trout.  Every single time I've ordered a fish entr√©e at a restaurant, I've been a little disappointed.  I tell myself that it's healthy, that I like fish...but then it turns out to be lacklustre and I wish I'd saved my money and done something similar at home.  The trout at Corner House...was heavenly.  I didn't know fish could have these flavours.  Fantastic.  Even the vegetable and potatoes that came with it, were amazing.  The tiny little potatoes were little bursts of flavour - but nothing was overly salty.  As for the steak, it was perfectly medium-rare and I was able to cut my portion with a butter knife.  It melted in my mouth.  The mashed potatoes that came with it were also wonderful.  \n\nFinally, the desserts.  Usually my favourite part of the meal, these didn't impress me quite as much as the appetizers and entrees, but they were still delicious.  It's probably just that the options weren't ones that I would usually pick.  My friend ordered the bread pudding and I had the panna cotta.  A panna cotta virgin myself, I was informed that they can often be overly sweet.  Not the case with this one.  It was sweet, of course, and very light and delicate.  The bread pudding was warm and lovely, and the caramel sauce was the perfect accent.  \n\nAnd the atmosphere.  This is the sweetest, most uniquely quaint restaurant I've been to.  As has been mentioned, it is a house re-done as a restaurant.  In the room where we were seated, there was a fireplace with lit candles in it.  Just beautiful.  I can't wait to go back this summer and sit on the patio.\n\nAll in all: delicious doesn't say enough.
