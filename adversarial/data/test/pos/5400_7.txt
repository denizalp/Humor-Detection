Takeout order:  Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi, Mixed Veg and Channa Masala. \n\nGot home and opened up my large containers of takeout and this is what appeared before me:\n\nChanna Masala not submersed in a two centimetre protective layer of Ghee?!  \nAloo Gobi not soaked in lovely red Ghee-goodness?!  \nMixed Vegetables not dripping wet with reddy Ghee goo?  What the heck?!  \nI can't even imagine not pouring Ghee out of my take out containers. Dabbing my food with paper towel to soak up excessive amounts of Ghee. What is happening here?!\nIn so much denial, I begin to load my plate of homemade Veg Biriyani with spoonfuls of of this culinary mirage. Bite after bite. Inspection of each spoonful. Huge chunks of chicken. Gravy.  Cauliflower, peppers, onions. Flavours?  Spices?  Nom Nom Nom.   \nVerdict in Two words:  \nYUMMY DELICIOUSNESS!!!  \nWhere has his place been all my life?  This was our first time ordering from NI and won't be the last.  One Star for wowing me about the Ghee and Three additional Stars for taste. I have to check this place out again for consistency. Follow up review to come.  Sorry about not having pics. The ghee less poods distracted me. Lol. \nPeace!
