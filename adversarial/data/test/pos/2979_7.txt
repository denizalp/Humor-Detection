During a recent trip to Las Vegas, my friends and I purchased a Groupon deal for SEA and I must say that discounts like that are the way to go when dining on the strip due to the horrific prices. I really do like Thai food quite a bit, but at the time I wasn't sure that would be my first choice for a Vegas weekend as there are so many great cuisines in the city, but SEA far exceeded my expectations. One of the girls and I decided to split a Pad See Ew plate because we never finish a full order anywhere else and knew that we would not be eating leftovers that weekend. We ultimately decided on beef at the suggestion of our waitress and she did not steer us wrong. The beef was so tender that it all but melted in my mouth and the noodles had just the right amount of soy sauce flavor. The bok choy were wonderfully cooked as well, though I do prefer it when there are other veggies as well. I will say that this was the smallest portion of Pad See Ew I've ever received (and the most pricey), so that part was a little disappointing since I was sharing with someone. \n\nThe service was wonderful, but did slow down a bit towards the end of our meal. One of my friends ordered a Thai Iced Tea not realizing that it is made with cream. She is lactose intolerant and our waitress had no issue substituting the already prepared Thai Iced Tea for a regular Iced Tea and that was much appreciated. \n\nThe ambiance was very cozy with a little darker lighting, which would make for a wonderful date night dinner on the strip. It did get crowded toward the end of our meal, but our 7:30PM reservation came with a more calm atmosphere. \n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend SEA, but try to get the Groupon deal!
