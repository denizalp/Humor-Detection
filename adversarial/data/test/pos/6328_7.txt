I've been here a handful of times now for my banking transactions. I've never had to wait to be helped. Employees are friendly and efficient. The space is clean. And the AC and cold water are a godsend in this stupid Vegas summer heat. And bonus point for the little lollipops at each teller station. \n\nI'm docking one star because this location shares a parking lot with a bunch of other businesses, including a gym. So finding a spot even towards the end of the row can be a pain. But nevertheless, I'll continue to banking here if I am in the area.
