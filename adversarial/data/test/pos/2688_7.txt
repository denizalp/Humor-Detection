Easy and fast. While there was no one else waiting when I arrived, I was still glad that I had checked in with the app. It told me that there was no wait.\n\nMy haircut was quick, it was good, and it was inexpensive. What more would you need? My stylist listened to my specifications and followed them perfectly. I have a haircut that I like.
