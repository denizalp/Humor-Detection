I bought my brother in law a Groupon as a gift to this place.  Margit stops 10 minutes into the massage and tells him I don't accept groupons and I get a call, she goes on to tell us she needs 40 bucks for the massage!  Little did I know she only massages him for 10 minutes and I paid her over the phone w\/my card!! She told him to reschedule with the other lady who accepts groupons.  If I bought it from her company you think it would be accepted?!?!?! Not happy with this lady or her company!!
