My very first Aldi experience was in Germany, and I was boggled by the great prices and the idea that you have to pay to rent a cart.\n\nNow I go to the 117th Aldi, and though they don't have German\/English books, they have pretty much everything you'd need.\n\nThis Aldi has better inventory management than Euclid because the center-aisle (misc\/household items) always seems to be \"not too\" picked over.\n\nOverall, this place is AMAZING.  Cheap snacks, cheap food, cheap frozen items.  I go here for all my parties and once a week for staples\/groceries.  Their frozen burgers and cheeses are especially hard to pass up!  Honestly, everything is hard to pass up, it's so cheap! \n\nWhy would anyone NOT shop at Aldi??\n\nps, bring a bag - they don't give them out!!  (but you should be bringing bags anyway, right???)
