I always like this event. The only problem is that I eat too much and three things happen: 1) My stomach hurts like halfway through the event 2) By having so much food in me, I can't drink that much 3) If I do drink, I can't get drunk. #FoodieProblems\n\nYes, I did a hashtag! Anyway, the event is a FANCY event. I really like fancy event. It's just the atmosphere and being at the Biltmore Resort, fancy is the norm. I haven't seen so many women in black mini-skirts all in one place. I guess you can count that as a plus for the event too. A lot of the servers were in costumes so that was awesome! Two waitresses were just painted in gold and wearing heels and a thong. They were very popular that night.\n\nI'm glad I got to eat a lot of food. I was questioning if $35 was worth it. But I guess it paid for my drinks, my food and the atmosphere. I ate so much I can't even remember what I ate. The yellow curry from Thai Elephant was good! There were duck sliders, lamb sliders, dates stuffed with chorizo wrapped in bacon crab cakes, chicken, bbq ribs, steak, pork belly, tamales, cheese, salami, pulled pork, mac and cheese, veggies, desserts, cupcakes and some things that I didn't even get a chance to try. Of course, the open bar was cool too! Beer or mixed cocktails.\n\nThe weird thing was... why were there non-restaurant tables in there? Like Gold's Gym and a costume booth. There were others too. I expect tables to be serving food because it's a food event. I can't eat a gym membership. I can't drink a costume.\n\nIf you go, I do give you a warning. Go early. Food does run out. And alcohol does run out. They ran out of whiskey half way through the night. For the ladies, wear comfortable shoes. A lot of girls' feet were hurting.
