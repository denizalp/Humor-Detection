This review is for customer service only.  I have not tried any pastries, but I didn't want to after our experience.\n\nMy fianc√© and I frequent the Tea Station (on the floor below Crown Bakery), but we wanted to try something a little different.  We walked into the Crown Bakery to see what they offer, and after reading lots of Yelp reviews, I was super excited.  I will say, the place is super cute and cozy (hence two stars instead of one).  I immediately noticed that they also serve boba drinks - the sign on the wall gave a list of their offerings.  I love boba, and I love to try boba all over the city.  Curious, I asked the lady behind the counter if that was a complete list of what they make.\n\nWell.  I guess I'm a moron, because she said, \"WHAAAAT??!?  WE DON'T SERVE BOOOOBBBAAAA HERE!\"  with her eyebrows waggling.  She told us to go down to Tea Station if we wanted boba... she was so rude about it, like I was a total idiot for asking.  Then she proceeded to cackle like a damn witch.  I said, \"but, but, but... they are listed on the menu...,\" stumbling all over myself because her behavior just wasn't appropriate for the situation.  It reminded me of Saturday Night Live.  It would make a good segment... she could be a good regular character!  They could call her Inappropriate Reaction Sally.  It was such a bizarre exchange of words that I started laughing.  She was laughing at me, and I was laughing at her.  Dueling cackles.  Cue banjos.\n\nNope, I won't be ordering pastries anytime soon.  In fact, I took her advice and headed on down to Tea Station, my regular hangout.  Good advice, Inappropriate Reaction Sally.  That might have been the most intelligent (and appropriate) thing you said all day.
