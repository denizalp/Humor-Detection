Another chain place that gets my 5 stars!\n\nI have to start this off my giving credit to my fellow yelper Amy K who checked into this place a few weeks ago & I had no idea what PDQ stood for. I was very pleasantly surprised to see some really delicious looking pics and what sold me was the crispy chicken salad, first pic!\n\nSo today after a long day at work & being sick all week I wanted to try something new and that salad looked so damn good. I was hoping it would taste as good as it looked and it did! Most salads are so disappointing for fast food chain places and this by far is my favorite salad ever! The dressings are homemade and they have a wide variety of choices. We tried a bunch of them and they gladly allowed us. \n\nThe chicken tenders are so moist and flavorful and the buffalo sandwich was outstanding. I also tried the special cheerwine soda which tasted exactly like most people described; Dr.Pepper with a hint of cherry. It was great! \n\nFor dessert we had a homemade cookie that was so fresh and chewy (bomb) and the apple slices soaked in pineapple juice that are then dipped in toffee sauce were amazing! I have to admit the drive across town was so worth it. \n\nThe restaurant itself is so new that it sparkles. It's adorable! Everything was so clean & shiny :) The service was great! They even have a community sink that you can wash your hands in after your meal with lavender soap. Nice touch PDQ folks! You have it going on and I'm happy to spread the word :)
