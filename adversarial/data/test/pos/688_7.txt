Having a rough day so far in PIT, but came here expecting to be amazed and wowed. Bummer. Wine was mediocre by the glass. Fried Brussels were fried into oblivion. Duck was very salty and flavorless. Now waiting on the roast chicken and hoping for the best! Won't rush to come back after some tasty meals I've had around the corner. Too much steakhouse, not enough modern vibe here.\n\nJust sent back the roast chicken too. I'm not a bone marrow fan but that clearly seems to be the thing to come for. If you're not not eating red meat, don't bother.
