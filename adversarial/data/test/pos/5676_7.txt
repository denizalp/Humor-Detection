I have family down in Vegas and I used to come here a lot when I was a child.  I used to love this place.  Now being 26 years old, it definitely lost it's aura.  Don't get me wrong, if you want to experience Vegas and have to bring your children, this is the hotel to go.  As you can see from the photos I posted, there is a fairly large arcade to keep your kids entertained.  \n\nIf you are looking for a cheap hotel, the rates here are pretty affordable. Location on the strip is good and a decent pool.
