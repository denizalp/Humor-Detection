I was really disappointed in this property.\n\nFirst, they have a serious parking issue.  It would be better if you flew in and didn't rent a car or never left the property so you didn't have to search and search and search for parking spaces each time you came back.\n\nNext, really, there are no luggage carts?  The only way, other than dragging everything around is to get someone with a dolly to help you.  Which pretty much means you're now obligated to give a tip.\n\nThe food in the lobby restaurant was too \"fru-fru\" for us, sometimes you just want basics with no sauces you can't pronounce.\n\nWe didn't get to the water park.\n\nI don't think I would stay here again.
