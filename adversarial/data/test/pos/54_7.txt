For a cocktail to be considered 'gin' it must be flavored with Juniper berries, hence the name of Juniper Cocktail Lounge. A small, chill bar and lounge off of the Park MGM casino floor, which specializes in gin cocktails.\n\nJuniper is the perfect spot to meet up with a few friends to pre-game before hitting The Strip, taking a break from throwing your money away, or to get some very IG-worthy drink photos! \n\nAnd speaking of which, if you do go to Juniper, you HAVE to order 'A Little Birdie.' The drink itself is gin, dry vermouth, strawberry, and fresh lemon, with a sprig of mint right where you can smell it as you're drinking. It all makes for a dangerously tasty cocktail. But, the whole thing with this drink is the hand-blown glass bird cocktail glass that it's served in. Each glass is done individually, so no two are exactly the same. I mean, they look basically identical, so I guess it doesn't really matter. But still cool! Juniper has lots of other delicious specialty gin-based cocktails that they serve, and you really can't go wrong with them. Between hitting up Juniper on back-to-back nights and having to finish other people's drinks, I think I actually wound up having a good number of those specialties. And I have to say, they were all pretty darn good.\n\nPart of what makes Juniper so awesome is just the very chilled ambiance that the lounge has. Along with the rest of Park MGM, Juniper sort of runs with a nature-inspired design. Brass leaf chandeliers and other nice pieces keep it dimly lit, while it's furnished with very comfortable couches and bar stools. Another thing that Juniper boasts are a great staff of bartenders. I found them all to be genuinely friendly for the most part. Seth especially stood out. He was very helpful and informative when we would ask questions about the different drinks, and really went above and beyond to provide a great experience.\n\n10\/10 would go back, and definitely plan to whenever I'm in Vegas again. Juniper is just my kind of place and I imagine most people will be able to say the same.
