I'd give Bei a 3.5. Who ever the Yelpers are that compare it to Shin Bay, have obviously never been to Shin Bay. Not even close to Hiro, for that matter. We're talking Ra or Kona Grill at best. \n\nFor shame fellow Yelpers, let's just call a spade, a spade. It's passable sushi in Scottsdale. \n\nFor those who disagree...get out more. Try real sushi.
