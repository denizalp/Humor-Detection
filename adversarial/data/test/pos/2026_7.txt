I spent months previewing Elvis wedding chapels in the area to do the deed.  The video was important.  The pictures were important.  I read tons of reviews. I watched I don't know how many Elvis weddings online.  (I feel like I owe some of these couples gifts.) In the end, I found the minister, the Elvis, and the right combination of comedy with the solemnity  in The Graceland Chapel in Las Vegas, NV.  \nThe wedding pictures blew me away. (I ain't  no supermodel.)  It helped kick off an outstanding time in Vegas that we will never forget.
