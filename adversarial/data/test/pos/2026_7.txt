WOW.\n\nI made late night reservations for Raku on a Thursday night.  As a fan of nearby Ichiza and their izakaya cuisine, I had heard that Raku served similar fare but was even better.  I was skeptical, but my sister swore by the place as well, having visited Raku along with some foodie friends of hers.  If it hadn't been for her insistence, I'm not sure I would have squeezed a visit in my busy schedule.\n\nI am SO glad I did.  \n\nThe taxi driver took us for a 10 minute drive off the strip into Chinatown where Raku is located.  A stereotypical strip mall store front greets you but inside the decor is modern and clean despite the small interior space.  Patrons were at every table and it's clear late night dining is their strength as they open til 2 am.    \n\nAfter a brief wait, our seats opened and we began to peruse the extensive menu.  Grilled yakitori items, oden broths, appetizers, and plentiful drinking choices greeted us.  Our plan of attack was simple: try a few things, get a few drinks, and continue as warranted.\n\nHours later, I had come to a clear conclusion : Raku is quite simply the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to and one of the best restaurants PERIOD that I have ever enjoyed.  As a huge fan of this type of Japanese cuisine, the preparation and presentation of all the dishes blew me away and it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a meal quite as much as I enjoyed this one.  Kudos to my sis.  \n\nA few standouts from among the 13 dishes I had:\n\nHouse-made Cold and Hot agedashi tofu - supremely fresh and soft with a hint of sweetness, I enjoyed both presentations.  The cold version is served with their signature green tea sea salt and their raku house soy sauce.  Both taste completely unlike any condiment you've had and enhance the cold tofu wonderfully.  The hot tofu is served in a rich oden broth and served with salmon roe.  Need I say more?\n\nBeef Tendon Oden Broth and Meat Intestine Oden Broth - $1.50 each.  Are you kidding me???  $1.50?!?!  That's it???  The single serving of tendon and intestine was flavorful, tender, and complemented wonderfully by the fantastic oden broth they make in house here.  I could order bowls of this stuff and stay all day.\n\nShima Aji Sashimi - fantastic cuts, served in three ways - on top of fresh seaweed, on top of soft glass noodles, and on top of a sauce.  Fresh as can be....how do they get that in the dessert?\n\nNagareko - braised abalone in broth.  One of the most tender abalones I've tasted and not the least bit overdone.  A strong delicious broth of seaweed accompanied it and enhanced the abalone flavor and aroma.  Top notch special.\n\nGrilled enoki mushroom with bacon, asparagus with bacon, and Grilled chicken yakitori - I've had yakitori at many places, most notable Sumika in Los Altos, but this was the best I've ever had.  Fantastic flavors, super tender, and absolutely crispy high quality bacon.  It simply is another level beyond yakitori I've had before.  Can't beat the $2-3 yakitori prices either (besides Kobe beef)\n\nSeafood with bonito guts - a favorite at Kappo Nami Nami in Mountain View, bonito guts are salted bonito intestines that go wonderfully with sake.   Their version is mixed with high quality sashimi and uni.  \n\nBesides the food highlights, the drink menu is outstanding and goes wonderfully with the food.  Fusion cocktails, Japanese specialty beers, and an extensive sake litter  the menu.  But it was the wonderful hot house sake that I loved for both it's sweetness and it's modest $7 price per bottle.  \n\nIf there are any misses at Raku, they are the oyakodon (the one dish that disappointed....egg slightly overdone) and the desserts (interesting but not mindblowing).  Otherwise, Raku is one of the best Japanese restaurants I've had and I immediately wanted to return the next day.  They have long been a top Yelp restaurant and even been named Restaurant of the Year.  The hype matched the reality.  For you NorCal Japanese fans, think of the best of Gochi, Sumika, Kappo Nami Nami combined and at even better prices and better quality.  I'm not sure you'll find food this good except in Japan.  It's simply that great.  \n\nReservations are a must and late night dining is encouraged to avoid crowds.  Raku accepts credit cards, including American Express.
