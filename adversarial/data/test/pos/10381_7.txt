First lets just talk about professionalism. Ever review I read said that they were professional. On the initial call, mike answers the phone as he is flushing the toilet. He then asks what he can do for me and as I'm answering he starts drying his hands, with an air dryer, and then asks me to repeat self. I commend him on the hand drying but time from flush to hand drying was way under the CDC recommended time to wash hands (20 seconds of scrubbing is what's recommended if you were interested).  Thankfully I never made it to the handshake. \n\nAnyways the whole point I called him was because because I had a leak in the attic of my house which caused some water damage to a ceiling and around a window. I tore out the wet drywall and repaired the leak myself but I am horrible at drywall and needed someone with some expertise to help finish the job. So I turned to yelp and search drywall repair. Lee's states it right in the name paint and drywall. Well mike has me text him some pictures so that he can give me an estimate. Next thing I know he is passing on the job because his drywall guy is \"not very good with windows\" \n\nNow I have to give him credit where it is due.  I am actually happy that he would much rather pass on a job if he can't do it well, but having drywall installation and repair right in the title is a little deceptive. Especially if your drywall guy \"isn't that good\" to do a repair around a window. \n\nI didn't leave a horrible rating due to the fact I never have seen his work but one should know that drywall (even though it is in the title) is probably not his specialty.
