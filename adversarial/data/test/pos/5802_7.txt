Did we go to a different place than everyone else writing a review here?\n\nWe went for the BBQ and really really really wanted to like this place. We give it one-half star for better than average pulled pork, another half for the wonderfully weird environment (including a rather nice wine and beer selection...in a car wash no less),  and another whole star for an array of truly delicious BBQ sauces. \n\nAs to the rest...not so good. The ribs were a huge disappointment. The online menu says \"St. Louis ribs\"; the in-house menu doesn't say. In fact they were baby backs which we don't care for. Much, much worse: THEY DON'T SMOKE THEM AT ALL! We were told the ribs are \"baked\" (we thought they'd been boiled, but what's the difference after all), had little or no seasoning or rub on them, and came out slightly mushy and totally tasteless.\n \nThe brisket was rather dry and had little flavor. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries were great. The mac and cheese was decent as were the baked beans. The vinegar cole slaw could have been great but wasn't.\n\nThe peach cobbler (which they gave us for free because we voiced that we didn't care for the ribs) was inedible: a few of the erratically sized slices of fruit were cooked perfectly while many others were rock hard and raw. We tasted only sugar. \n\nIt seemed to us that whoever was in the kitchen simply didn't care.
