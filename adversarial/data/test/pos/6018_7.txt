This is a dangerous spot kids. I popped in to scope it out before a Yelp Elite event at Notorious Burgers. Super glad I had plenty of time. There's *so* much to take in here! Give yourself plenty of time to walk around. (And chuckle!) If you need a gift this place rocks!\n\nThe walls, counters and shelf space are filled with the most unique candles, mugs, signs, clothing, furniture, table-top stuff, jewelry, furniture...and well, stuff! (My list of products is deficient in covering what the store offers.) I know I said gifts. However, I wanted soooo many things for myself. The buyer of this store has sourced incredibly unique product lines. \n\nFor example, I picked up napkins that were hilarious. (A nun holding a phone \"OMG\".) Making women in the store laugh was a border line inappropriate candle. (A twelve inch man with a wick in the most amusing location.) Or the sunglasses I just *had* to pick up for myself. They read \"Older But-wiser\" and have a distinct look of that beer to them.\n\nWhat truly differentiated this store are the artist designed products.  Truly one of kind pieces are available in this store. Contact information is listed for each artist. Funky is one way to describe. Fun is definitely another. Visiting this store is truly an experience. Decorating your home with small, medium or large pieces from here will make you smile.\n\nMy favorite part (as if there could be more!) was the customer service. I'm so embarrassed to admit this. The wonderful woman who helped me was a joy. (I forgot to ask her name. Eek!) She explained the store has been family owned 24 years, in a variety of locations.\n\nOh! And if you'd like some clothing hemmed or altered, you can have that done here! There is an on-site seamstress. Pure awesomeness! \n\nSuper cool place.
