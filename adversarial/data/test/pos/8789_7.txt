Staff are friendly and they even hook the kids up with free ice cream at the end! How thoughtful! This review is coming rather late and I seriously thought I typed one on. Apparently not because here I am.\n\nI am by far the most dantiest hotdog eater, ever. I can go years without putting a hotdog in my mouth...cue in long blink...lol. stay focus, stay focus...\n\nThe husband is the only reason why we even came here to begin with. He has a co-worker who is from Chicago and says this place is the real deal. Well, if you're like me and don't even know what that really means...apparently, it is. They serve the Vienna brand and I still don't know what that means. All I know is the taste and smell of vienna sausage from a can makes me puke and that's how I associate vienna. So brave me who is trying to get my taste buds out the norm...opt for the Chicago dog. \n\nIf you do not know, you're going to want to because it is absolutely delicious. For someone like me who prefers just ketchup and onions on my hotdog whenever I do...the Chicago dog gave me a new appreciation. The hotdog had a snap to it that I do expect of a hotdog. I don't know if it's because it's vienna, I didn't particularly like the flavor of the dog itself...but add in the sport peppers, relish, mustard, tomatoes, celery salt, a soft poppy seed bun and all that other jazz...i was able to overlook it. You can't help but to look around and ask for another one! It was deelish! It comes with pickled Spears as well but I can't stand pickles and relish is as far as I can handle. I don't even like mustard but I decided to not omit so I can get as true to the experience as possible.\n\nMy Chicago dog was 5 bucks with fries! Hoody hoo!\nHusband got some Italian sausage something something...I didn't keep track. I had 4 other heads whose order I had to keep in mind. All I know was he was in big boy heaven. His cost about 7 bucks I believe as his was a sandwich rather than a hot dog. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe this place is worth every penny. Everything was made to order and everything tasted very fresh. We are in the area weekly and I know my husband is going to want to come by for his fix...he had one yesterday but I had him try out a different hotdog spot. It's really nice too because customers were coming in and just talking up a storm like you'd see at diners who are clearly frequent customers. So that makes it feel pretty homely.\n\nHighly recommend if you are in a hotdog mood and you got more spare to change so that a hotdog fix doesn't consist of a trip to your local wholesale warehouse. =P
