I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars strictly because of service.  I ordered the steak fajitas which happened to be some of the best fajitas I have had in Las Vegas but they were delivered by such an unhappy, unhelpful waitress (Mercedes) that it almost ruined it for me.  The rice that comes with the fajitas is fantastic as is the salsa.   After receiving horrible service, an 18% gratuity was automatically added to my bill (for a party of 5).  \n\nMy kids ordered off of the Strip Burger menu (located next door but owned by the same people) and they enjoyed them.  All 3 of them ordered a milk shake to go and apparently something was wrong with my sons as it all came back up as soon as we pulled into the driveway.\n\nI would probably return to eat the fajitas again but would specifically request not to sit in her section.  Tip-If you don't like your job, find a new one!
