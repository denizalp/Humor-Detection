Nordstrom, or Nordy's for the extra cool people among us, is a must stop when shopping at department stores. They don't always have the best selection around, but the have always provided wonderful customer service. Additionally, they stand by their product and their return policy is outstanding. \n\nWhen you add in the Nordstrom Caf√©, it makes for the most logical place to park and start you shopping visits to the Fashion Show Mall.
