One of the worst service I ever had in my life!\nThe waitresses were very rude, they seemed miserable, and obviously hated their jobs.\nThe food was hit or miss. Nothing great or special.\nUltimately, avoid if you can. They didn't even give us our change after we paid. Come here if you want to pay to be treated awfully. Definitely never returning.
