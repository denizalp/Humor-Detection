Ok, so this review outs my metrosexuality - but damn it I love Catherine enough to write this review. I used to go to Catherine when she used to work at Zoltons, Chandler (which shut down since) and she is without the shadow of a doubt the best aesthetician  I've been to (and sadly Ive got to admit I've been to a few)  She gets my eyebrows done almost perfectly (So yes I get my eyebrows done, I was cursed with the unibrow and going werewolf aint quiet attractive!) without the whole someone poked me in the rear permanent exclamatory look. \n\nI haven't quiet used another of her services but I do know she is very personable and accommodating and gets me in as best as she can in spite of my crazy schedule. I hope to avail of the rest of her services later on but for now this is all \n\nBella Donna is in a dental office building so it is easy to miss but just walk in and ask for Kat, I assure you that you will not be upset!
