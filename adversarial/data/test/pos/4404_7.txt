I went in today for an appointment I had scheduled a week in advance. I payed the $100 fee upfront and i might as well have just given it to him and walked out. This is the most unprofessional lawyer I have ever seen. He never gave us legal advice, rather just telling us about our situation ( which we already know ). then 15-20 min into our meeting (which was schedule for an hour), He began answering calls on the phone. Then he stepped out saying he was going to ask his assistant( daughter) a question pertaining to our case, we sat there for 30 min listening to him talk on the phone with someone in the other room about another case! We walked out of the office without him ever returning or asking us why we were leaving. I would not recommend this law office to my worst enemy.
