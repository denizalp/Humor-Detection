Most horrible nightclub experience I've had in Las Vegas for last 4 years. \n70% of dance floor horny local dudes and hookers. \nBouncers are the rudest I've ever seen.After I deal with them I don't wanna even go inside of Cosmopolitan.  Too sad I feel negative about a whole Casino. Used to be my favorite.
