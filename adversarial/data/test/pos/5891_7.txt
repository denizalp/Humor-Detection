A mindblowing hotel for my first trip to vegas.\nPulled infront and was quickly greeted by a valet for hotel parking. Theres a massive metal structure outside that reminded me of a transformer, this blew my mind and made me very excited to see what i had instore. This hotel sits across the the aria, is not directly on the las vegas strip which made it the perfect place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of las vegas. This hotel has no casino but a lovely bar, eatery, spa, gym, and starbucks Inside. The decor is super artsy and modern with alot of wood on the walls making is a little darker with beautiful chandeliers. This place was fancy! The strip was easy to access, and easy to get away from.\n\nMy boyfriend did an amazing job in choosing our Vdara suite. It was unvelievable! This was the nicest hotel experience ever. The setup was studio like, a one bedroom design making you feel at home the second you walk in. The room comes with AC like every hotel in las vegas. Let me help you paint a picture. Walking from the front door your welcomed by a beautiful kitchen with a sink, pantry, fridge, cooktop, and a lovely dining area for 4. Take 10 paces from there you walk into a large living room area with a pull out queen size sofa bed, table, 2 lounge chairs, desk, and flatscreen tv hanging on a built in wall divider. Take 8 paces to the left you are now in the bedroom with a large king size bed with the coziest bedding with two bedside tables, his and hers lamps mounted above head and another flat screen mounted on the other side of the room divider. Open the large screen like sliding door with frosted glass next to the closet and you have an extravagent spa-like bathoom with a soaking tub, standing shower room enclosed in glass, toilet and sink with backlit vanity mirrors. Did I mention the amazing panoramic views through their expansive picture windows (amazing at night with all the vegas lighting), they even came with its own mechanical shade system! Allowing you to control the amount of light you wanted to allow into the room. Housekeeping kept the room stocked with towels and toiletries. The staff were all very freindly and helpful. I didn't want to leave this hotel, I wanted to live there.\n\nMy boyfriend treated me this amazing experience. I will remember it for the rest of my life. There are so many wonderful things to say about this hotel. I would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat if I could. It was truly a home away from home and I miss it dearly.
