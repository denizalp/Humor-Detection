We drove out to Summerlin on the Fourth to watch the parade and MTO was one of the handful of restaurants open for lunch that day. We ordered some classics that were made to order with  fresh ingredients that left everyone satisfied.\n\nThe line was about 10 deep at 11:30 on the holiday but moved quickly. The menu is fairly large with both standard American breakfast and lunch fare. Our wait was about 5 minutes and after ordering through the fast casual set up and pouring our drinks, we had a seat outside where there was some shade to protect against the temperatures which were pushing into triple digits.\n\nThe food was brought out in a timely manner despite how busy it was. The tortilla was layered toward the top on my huevos rancheros which pleased me that the texture wasn't lost from the salsa and egg yolk. I also got to have half of my wife's turkey melt. With both dishes, the creamy, fresh avocado stood out the most.\n\nEven though we were outside, an employee regularly checked on us and cleared our plates when we finished. Lunch for three was a little pricey at $42. This is a worthy stop if you're looking for standard breakfast or lunch and might not have time for a full sit down meal.
