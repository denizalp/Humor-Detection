If you are looking for a restaurant that is crowded,  serves  $18 glasses of house wine, in a dark empty hotel - this is the place for you.  This restaurant was a HUGE disappointment. I am a big Giada TV fan, so I was very excited to go.    To start the Cromwell hotel is dark, and very empty -even for 8pm on a Friday night .  The hostess reminded me of a typical LA hostess, barely looks at you in the eye, not very friendly and certainly not customer service oriented.     The menu was very disappointing, to start we ordered the soup   Pasta Fagiolo- they took our order, came back and said sorry - no soup left. ( Shouldnt they have known that when we ordered?)  When we continued to order the main course and asked for a few substitutions - it was actually pretty humorous- their answer was No, No , No . They were saying no before we could even ask the question!   They kept explaining that certain items were pre- made. WHAT?    They made it very clear that substitutions were not welcome.   I didn't find any of their menu choices very appetizing, and that was ironic because we walked in with a $250.00   food comp.  I ordered a  mini Pizza -can I get goat cheese on it ? NO we don't have crumbles. But you have Goat Cheese on the menu- NO.\nThe Pizza reminder me of a Lean Cuisine Pizza, that was the exact size.. \nOverall, with all of the fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas, I would pass on this. Absolutely nothing like I expected - the service or the food quality.\nWe left and went to  a French  restaurant, received fantastic service, enjoyed amazing food and wondered why we didn't go there in the beginning.
