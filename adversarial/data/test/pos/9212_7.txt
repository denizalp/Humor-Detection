I can see how La Banquise would be touristy.  It never closes, serves what you want after you stumble out of a bar, and it has been televised on certain travel shows in the US.  But after going several times at 3am, I'm not so sure if it is.  Every time I was in line, I had gotten into conversations with native Montrealers, even sat and ate with, most of whom were surprised to learn that three dudes from Philly made it to this poutine eatery.  I did not meet anyone that wasn't from Montreal while in queue.  It's also kinda out of the way and even a nice local stripper recommended that I should go here.  I forgot her name, but she danced with reading glasses on so I'd assume she was probably wise.\n\nFries, cheese curds, gravy, and a myriad of meat combinations to put you on your ass for the night.  I recommend the T-Rex, topped with hot dogs, bacon, pepperoni and ground beef.  I'd also recommend visiting St. Luc's hospital as well.
