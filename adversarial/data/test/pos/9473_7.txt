Hey Meatball! Evelyn W here. \n\nI hopped off a flight after a whirlwind 36-hour-fun-fest and jumped in a cab at the downtown airport. I needed the internet, I needed to eat and I needed a hug. Is there is a food that can nourish you and make you feel like you're being hugged even if your not? A meatball sub. So \"College and Crawford, please...\" is what I muttered to the cab driver while checking my email. Before I knew it I was waiting for The Rod Father, my fave meatball sub of all time. And Bam! They have free wifi!\n\nJust go and get The Rod Father, and really enjoy the side salad. Top 5 side salads in the city. \n\nPEPPER POINTS for their made in house sodas. This hyper hypo killed a cream soda for the first time in years.
