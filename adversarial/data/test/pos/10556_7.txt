Ehhh my mom was craving Chinese food so I decided to give this place a go since I had a buy 2 get 1 free entrée coupon.. Called in my order and they said it would be ready in just 10 minutes so that's a plus.. fast food! When I got there for some reason I had trouble finding the main door LOL I thought it was on the side somewhere by Nagoya.. Any ways.. they didn't seem too happy that I had a coupon.. Which, by the way, saved me $10 so yay. I wasn't really hungry but I did sample a little bite of each entrée :\n-Chicken Chow Fun Dry: It was ok... flat, thin, long rice noodles pan fried with soy sauce, onions, bean sprouts & chicken.\n-Beef & Asparagus: way too salty\n-Orange Chicken: It's deep fried & coated with a sweet orange glaze.. of course it's tasty but so is Panda Express haha \n-Steamed Rice: They gave us 3 large containers of rice which was way too much but a plus since some places don't include rice.. But the rice was a cheap quality rice.\n-To-go containers: I like their plastic Tupperwareish to-go containers. Prevents spilling and leakage.. AND they are re-useable haha \n\nAnywho.. This place is not really worth checking out. The prices aren't even that low for take out quality food..\n\nHOT TIP: Look in your mail for Valpack Coupons.. that's where you'll find their buy 2 get 1 free entrée coupon!
