Average oil change place.  They boast of an 18 point inspection, but skip anything that doesn't make money like vacuuming.  Some staff is nice and friendly, but the owner is not.  He will whine about credit card transaction fees and appears to be in a constant state of anger.  I feel sorry for his staff.
