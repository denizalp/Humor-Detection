Despite decent salad and drink, our waitress ruined our meal. A manager accidentally spilled a margarita on my friend. Accidents happen. But that was a cue to try to make it a better experience. Our waitress refused to write down our order and then fouled it up. My friend ordered a chicken salad and was delivered one. But the waitress oddly argued it was a steak salad, wanted to charge her as such and then said, \"That's OK, I just won't charge you for the steak.\" I went through the same argument about the mythical chicken she was certain was on my salad. Even after I showed her no such chicken was actually on salad. Nonetheless, she reminded me, she would still need to charge me for the chicken. Both of our salads had beans. Per the meal's hidden theme, no beans arrived. When we asked, she reminded us they were out of beans. No such conversation happened -- and there were two diners and one waitress -- so I feel we have reality on our side. When we'd had enough of having her argue with us about our meals, she told me not to worry that I was wrong, she wouldn't charge us. And then called me \"Sweetie.\" If you want to be the trapped monkey in someone else's circus, go sit in her station
