I really had a great experience at Basil Thai.  I found the atmosphere to be sophisticated, with a very cool \"uptown\" vibe.  It is dimly lit and rather small so there is limited seating.  Some of the tables seemed to be on top of one another but it still \"worked.\"\n\nThe service was solid, friendly and consistent throughout our evening.  We had a party of 6 chatty, giggly women and our server handled us all quite well.  He was on top of his game and new the menu well.  His upselling was very subtle so it didn't bother me at all.\n\nI went with a pretty basic meal...pad thai but it was very good!  The only thing I would say is that I wish it was a little spicier.  The waiter informed us that it does not come with spice but you can add mild, medium or hot spices to the dish.  I went with medium and it still didn't give it much pizazz!  I also didn't taste the \"peanut\" sauce at all.  The dish was good but I would have enjoyed a few more pieces of shrimp and a little more flavor\/spice.  I will definitely come back.  I would love to try their curry dishes.\n\nOne other thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the fact that they pour a very small glass of wine.  We estimated that it must be around 4oz but yet you pay full price (8-12 dollars).\n\nThe location is key and if you go there for dinner you are surrounded by other \"fun\" spots if you choose to continue your evening in the uptown area.  You are right there across from 5 Church, next to Dandelion Market, near Cowbell, Roxbury and a few other places.  \n\nI'll be back!
