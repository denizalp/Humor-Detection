Not a good overall experience.\n\nNice atmosphere...but it all ends there.  Our server, who felt that she's too good to be there, was MIA for the most part.  That should've been a cue to get up and leave, but we decided to give it a go.  My hubby had the chicken enchilada with chili verde sauce.   Nothing worth noting, but he said it was good.  My little cutie pie had 2 shrimp tacos.  Mind you, each taco had ONE little battered shrimp in there for $4.75.  Flopping the hard corn tortillas about, he didn't feel that he was playing with his food because it was inedible.  So, for two pieces of medium sized beer battered shrimp came to $9.50! \n\nI was in the mood for a big bowl of menudo and taco al pastor.  The marinated pork was delicious.  I should've had a couple of that instead.  The menudo already had the red chile in it and chock full of tripe and hominy.  Hubby and son just glanced over to make a weird face at me right before I put a spoonfull in my mouth.  The good comforting flavor was there and so was a whole cup of salt.  I squeezed more lime in it to see if it will lessen the sea water.  \n\nOur server came and I told her that I just can't eat the menudo.  She looks at the bowl with her hands around it and asks \"What did you want me to do with it?\"  She just gave me an attitude like it was my fault it was salty.  \"Well, if you squeezed lime in there, it brings out more of the saltiness.\"  What kind of bullshit was that?  I told her to send it back because it will give me high blood pressure!  In place of that horrible soup, I got the arrachera taco which dried my toungue up even more.  \n\nI don't think I can give this place another chance.  I will, however, try Barrio Cafe someday.  It will surely be a better experince than this one.
