Came here for the weekend brunch right before our flight and informed our waiter that had an hour to grab a meal. We ordered right away - a spinach tofu curry, bulgogi and tuna roll. After nearly thirty mins and complaining, we got the sushi roll and at that point waiter gave me a bull shit excuse on how because my dish is vegan, it would take longer and how the tofu is frozen and all kinds of excuses. About ten mins later we got our food and it looked like it was rushed and the waiter forgot to put in my order. The spinach curry was watery with pur√©e of spinach and lacked flavor. Tasted like water with spinach and tofu was steamed and jasmine rice was still undercooked and raw. \n\nWhen I informed the waiter that I wasn't happy with the dish, he took my plate and screams in the middle of the restaurant to the chef - \"hey chef, she hated the dish.\"  Juan, the waiter was just incompetent and rude and I'm so surprised by the service received especially being inside of such an amazing hotel and a hotel that also houses twist run by a Michelin star chef. \n\nWhat a waste of brunch and had to leave hungry to catch my flight.
