it's SO big (that's what she said), no really, it is.\nI stayed at this place for 4 days and probably didn't see all of it.\n\nThe daytime check in staff was pretty mediocre and almost quite rude (you know who you are) though it's worth mentioning how nice  the checkout staff was. I guess the front desk staff can be hit or miss.\n\nThe bellmen were awesome and very friendly. One guy who brought our bags to the room for us spent a good half hour filling us in on the scene and giving us a few tips and tricks for everything from gambling to eating. He wore out his welcome after the first 15 minutes but we still appreciated it :)\n\nThe casino was nice and has a bit of my money tucked into it's fancy money machines! Pussy Cat Dolls area with dancing ladies was interesting. I kind of felt like I walked into a lame strip club on accident.\n\nThe rooms were ok, the bathrooms were awesome, don't touch anything in the fridge or you'll pay, and that goes for the digital camera and $3 mini pringles. I don't think any of the hotels in Vegas smell nice mainly because you can smoke in them so don't count on roses and fresh laundry scents. \nGreat place to stay and I always felt close enough to the action.
