It's 3:30 late night early morning. You're on your way home after being in the club for who knows how many hours. They know you been drinking and no matter which way you take they're waiting for you, and being strategically placed around the city, they'll  get you before you make it home.\n  Yes, I'm talking about  Roberto's tacos. Open 24 hours and multiple locations. The chances of finding a Roberto's taco shop when you're drunk are as good as finding a McDonald's when you're sober.\n  Every time I go to Roberto's I have a hard time deciding what I want to order, ( besides having a hard time standing) everything is SO good. The machaca burritos and the rolled taquitos and the nachos and pretty much anything else that ends in \"os\" are my favorite!  \n  So next time you're out and looking for something good and little greasy to help you soak some of the alcohol in your system. Robertos is the place!\n  And please don't use Roberto's as an excuse for drinking..... That's \"my\" excuse!
