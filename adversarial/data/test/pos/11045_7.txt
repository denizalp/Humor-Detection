bars and clubs closed and no place to go? Here's the place. We defended some drunk girls who were shoved by some douchey guys in the giant crowd trying to enter, and they adopted us into their party so we got to enter with nearly no wait at all. I remember that part.\n\nIt's downstairs, cover is $20 on these ultra crowded nights, creepy people hit on us. Drinks were strong. It was dark. And red. And we got home at 6am. I remember less about that part.
