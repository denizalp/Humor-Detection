DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE! \n\nThey just care about the money in your wallet not about your pet OR you! \nLauren b must be a friend of Misty's because I called Cindy first & then the day of the appointment spent 10 minutes expalining to Misty what I wanted and I got everything but, ... didnt even recognize my 11mo Labradoodle. I requested that his tail & head, face, ears etc...NOT be trimmed ...it was his baby hair...that he had never been to a groomer before (other than me) and the load noises scared him...they assured me he was in \"good hands\". HA!\n\nI should have known when Misty reluctantly came to the bench in the front of the shop so I could sit down and talk with her about Sonny and what I wanted for him... there was also a slight hurumpf almost...\n\nYou think for $65 you can get what you want but, no!  I was in such shock all I could do was walk away though I did tell Misty I hated it and Cindy as I ran into her in the parking lot....I just moved to Vegas and everyone had been so nice I sadly trusted these women. \n\nThen,... a day later, I found out THEY INJURED HIM AND DID NOT EVEN TELL ME....These jokers cut off the top layer of dew claw pad and sent him home. I didn't realize it until a day later Sonny was STILL licking his leg....that is when I REALLY got upset.\n\nSo I called Cindy and calmly explained to her about my upset....the response I got was even more upsetting! She said she \"cannot glue his hair back\" however, would pay for him to go to her vet next door...I said \"arent you even going to appologize\"? Her response was \"no,...I saw him in the parking lot and he looked fine!\" WOW My Italian came out,...at this point I wanted my money back AND a trip to the vet.....she refused to reimburse me again saying he looked fine to her.\n\nI am a two time cancer survivor and Sonny is my service dog I recieved as a gift last year for my birthday ....he is so sweet, well behaved, and gentle.....looking back he almost jumped in my arms when I arrived and now I know why...THEY HURT MY BOY! \n\nI sadly I didnt check the reviews on the internet before going Tails a Waggin as Chateau Calais recommended them...I just wanted my boy comfortable as we just relocated to sunny Vegas from Colorado ...\nAlso, I never got my discount...\n\nThis haggared, middle aged, miserable woman doesn't seem to care let alone \"love\" what she does...as her web site states....she's a phoney and probably sucked in her law firm as well.The experience WAS NOT low stress for me nor my companion. I almost didnt go back even for the vet visit there as I was so upset from the whole ordeal. \n\nNOTE TO CINDY & MISTY: \nCindy,......this weekend I went garage sale hunting with Sonny and meet another groomer, other labradoodle owners(I am starting a doodle group), and many animal lovers...I told my story to all of them and will tell many more in the days ahead so this doesn't happen to other owners who care about there loved ones. FInd another profession you \"love\" cause you got a big fat \"F\" from me and I got a loud articulate mouth. As a \"professional\" and a business owner you should have immediately at least appologized for hurting my dog or reimbursed me!
