2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     22\/100\n\nFirst heard about this place through Facebook. I went a week or two after their soft opening... hopefully to avoid the long lines, but when we got there was a long line out the door. haha! DUH. Come on, Michelle. Definitely a good sign for them. Luckily, I was with my favorite people and we got to catch up on a few things. \n\nAnyways, I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but the friends I was with are. I was excited to try this place out because I love coffee and tea and I love businesses with a creative twist. \n\nWhen we finally got inside, the decor was amazing. Harry Potter theme was well executed, a spot for HP fans to pose for their social media photos. Even though I'm not a HP fan, I loved the decor. They also had fresh orchids by the register, one of my favorite flowers. \n\nThere were also bakery items and healthy snacks, bananas and fruit near the register. Nice touch, great for healthy foodies. \n\nI ordered the Lavender Latte, this one I was excited to try because after reading their menu online, I found out it's made with housemade lavender. As I ordered, I asked if there was any way to make it less sweet or no sugar as I was watching my sugar intake because of health reasons, borderline diabetes. The cashier had no idea how to answer the question. Ok, understandable. They were still working out the kinks.  I forgot to ask if they could just make it as a tea and not a latte. \n\nIt wasn't bad, but I had to sip it slowly. It was still sweet for my taste. Plus, they used Vitamin D whole milk (it has tons of sugar). I tried the Butterbeer Latte but it was my first time trying it so I can't compare to the real deal Butterbeer. My lavender didn't have any tea leaves in it, but my friend's drink did. I had no desire to finish mine, and I must have wasted half the latte. \n\nDisappointed with the drinks and service, my friends have went back several times and the drinks still need work, so I'll come back when they are more experienced. I'll still recommend to Harry Potter fans, and friends and family from out of town.
