Shockingly I've lived here for years and this was my first time ever trying the milkshake factory. It was exceptionally warm in the middle of January so I figured why not. I'm not sure what the south side location looks like but the downtown location is really nice. Everything looks super clean and it has a fairly large area of seating. \n\nAs for the milkshakes what can you really say besides they are delicious? Milkshakes are milkshakes and they are all delicious. I will say that they had some deluxe shakes that looked amazing. I will definitely be stop ping back in once spring rolls around!
