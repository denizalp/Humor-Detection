Sourdough Cafe: classic diner restaurant inside a locals casino. Menu is predictable, prices are low, portions are huge, quality is hit or miss. For best bets (pun intended), go for breakfast because those foods are harder to screw up. The chicken fried steak and eggs or the build your own omelet are solid choices. For other meals, proceed with caution when ordering the pastas or prime rib. While those dishes should also be hard to screw up, they've been disastrous in the past. Skip the line by checking to see if bar seating is available.
