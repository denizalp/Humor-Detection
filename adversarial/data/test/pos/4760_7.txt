Quaint space along Harbord. Have been to several locations but this was my first time here. My friend ordered an Americano, I ordered an espresso and was truly underwhelmed. Didn't pack the punch I was looking for. It almost tasted like they ran out of espresso beans and used anything else they could find. I'm willing to give them another shot here because the staff was friendly and prompt!
