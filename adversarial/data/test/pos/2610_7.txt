This store is the closet grocery store to me. I gave 4 stars because the prices are high. But you get what you pay for. Well stocked organized clean & spacious. The plus is they have a pharmacy including a drive-up window, also a Money Center for money orders bill payments money transfers etc. I snapped a picture of the front of the pharmacy inside the store, apparently the are giving it a face lift.
