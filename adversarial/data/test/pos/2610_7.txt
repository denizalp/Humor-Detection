Don't ever work here!! They don't hire the right people and then make other people there suffer too. Their finance team is the worst and they can't even hire an AP person to do the job so they put it all on other people! There bills never get paid and I have no clue how they haven't been shut down yet. They need new management who know how to treat people!
