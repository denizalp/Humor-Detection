Tasty hot wings, with fries that are just alright. We chose Beerhaus twice; once for take-out and once alfresco on their outdoor patio. A live band was blaring Rolling Stones and ZZ Top tunes, so not great for conversations. And this second time I ordered a chili dog, while the wife and son both went with the wings and fries again. Not as good as take-out a few nights prior. And my chili dog could have used a bit more chili. But other then it being on the rather small side, it actually was very good with a lot of pop in each bite.
