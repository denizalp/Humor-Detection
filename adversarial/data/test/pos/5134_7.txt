I have been coming to this bar for many of its incarnations. It has always been a favorite dive spot of mine - only Mugshots really isn't a dive bar, and that's actually OK. \n\nIt's clean, the owners and bartenders are all nice and they have a decent selection of good beers. What else could a dive enthusiast want?\n\nThe Internet jukebox also plays The Thong Song by Sysqo.
