Gawd awful service.  \n\nThis is not a food critique.  It's McDonalds.  It is what is is.\n\nBut what it is about is the WORST service ever at a McD's.  Across all shifts and all different employees.  IDK if its shitty due to lack of staff or if they can't keep staff cause its shitty to work there.  Either way it shouldn't take 7 minutes for a large Ice Tea.  Serious. 7 minutes.  Or the time I ordered 2 double hamburgers, waited almost 10mins, got only single patties.  Watched her throw them in garbage when all I needed was a patty taken out of the plastic tray that keeps it warm and put on the damn things.  Wasteful. And another 8mins.  And a snotty and dismissive attitude when the MANAGER gives me my order eith no apology for mix up or wait.  I hate that this place is across the street from me and is 24hours.  \nlousy customer experience and a lot of homeless hanging around as well.  And the washrooms are usually dirty. So yay.
