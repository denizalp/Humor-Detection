I eat crawfish all the time back home, and all my friends had said hot n juicy is really good, comparable to boiling crab, so we gave it a try today.. And it was eh. Very disappointing. The hot n juicy sauce was alright. It was a mixture of garlic butter, lemon pepper and what not. Make sure to shake up the bag for all the garlic at the bottom! Either way, the sauce was okay not that flavorful unless you pick up a crawfish with all the garlic on it. I had to order a extra side of spicier sauce.. We ordered 5lb and the crawfish was all small. Every 2lb comes with free corn and potato which was cool, but neither had any flavor either. I don't know. Maybe it was an off day, or it's just this location. Cause my friend who was also dining with me did not even touch her 2lb, she said Chinatown is much better? Idk but never again. Was not worth our 100$. We could've ate a buffet instead.
