You mean: HELLUVA Burger?  Hardees has the BEST burger of all the fast food chains, and arguably one of the best in the entire burger industry.  \n\nLittle Thickburger is the best your money can buy.\n\nThe MEAT: Black Angus. \nThe PREP: Freshly Charbroiled to order\nThe LBS: Heavy enough to put a triple quarter pounder at McD's to shame.\nThe FIXINS: Cheese, Lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup and a pickle on a toasted sesame seed bun.\nThe SERVICE: Impeccable:  What other fast food chain actually walks over to your table to ask, 'How's everything here?\"\nThe TASTE: Sublime\nThe QUALITY: Consistently consistent.\n\nIf you haven't tried Hardees, for fear of the unknown, for fear of not liking it as much as the BIG and ULTRA FAMOUS chains, you don't know what you're missing.  \n\nBut then again, that leaves more HARDEES for me!
