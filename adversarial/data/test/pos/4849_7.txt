Our first stop and Vegas and what a disappointment. We had 12 people total, but decided to get seated separately so we wouldn't have to wait as long. First party got seated in 40 minutes after writing our names down while the other party waited outside anxiously. I was in the 2nd party. I was walking in and out to check on my friends and I saw plenty of tables leaving and clearing up. After like 20 minutes, I asked how long the wait will be and the hostess didn't know.\n\nI see my friends got fries but no burgers yet. After another 10 minutes, we see so many EMPTY tables so we ask if we could get seated. We even pointed at the empty tables and they told us we will get seated when they were ready... 10 minutes later, we still didn't get seated and our friends that were seated earlier didn't even have burgers yet. \n\nWe all left and went to the Subway next door. What a joke
