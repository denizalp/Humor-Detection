Every single review is on point, these people are galactically stupid. I have been calling daily for a month to get an update on my account and refund which they OWE ME with 0 success.  They also keep telling me on the phone I will receive a call from them. Really? Has anyone ever gotten a call from the DMV telling them, surprise, we owe you money!? I think not.  I have spoken with pseudo supervisors, requested expedited service, sometimes I called 3 times a day, and each time I received different response.  It is utterly exhausting and ridiculous.
