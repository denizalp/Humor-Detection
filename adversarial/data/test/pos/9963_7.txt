I'm giving this 3 stars now although I will probably go back when nearby and adjust my review based on more information.\n\nI went because i was in the mood for burger and fries and hate fast food.  It definitely was not disappointing.  Great burger flavor, cooked perfectly, great bun, toasted just right and LOVED the fries.\n\nI loved that the chef\/owner meets everyone who comes in.  The guy seems to care.  I thought the waitress was friendly and responsive. It seemed a tiny bit long of a wait for a burger but then I was really hungry to it could just be my growling stomach.  That being said both burger and fries were hot of the grill, out of the basket so there was no waiting around.  The got it to me seconds after it was done.\n\nI tried the dessert you see everywhere here and really liked it.  SUPER sweet so if you like something mildly sweet this won't work for you.  I wasn't sure what it was by photos but wanton wrapped cheesecake fried and ice cream and fried something else that was supposed to be bananas foster but tasted like more cheesecake (fine with me) and brownie and then fried wonton strips that look like noodles and everything drizzled with chocolate syrup and fruit syrup.  I actually liked the light crunchy of the fried wonton strips with the sweet syrup. It was fun.\n\nThe regular menu wasn't small but not as big as a lot of kind of \"pub food\" places I have seen.  I was hoping for a special I was interested in like schnitzel but just decided to stick with the plan on burger and fries.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNote:  I was there fairly early for dinner but it seemed very family friendly.  there were only 2 other groups and both had youngish children to early teens.  One said they came there all the time.  The waitress either knew kids well and\/or had them herself because she immediately said there was not a kids menu but suggested some really good things the kids got excited about\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nNow a few things I think could use improvement:\n1. It smells a little musty like old cigarette smoke.  There's a bar attached but not burning cigarettes.  I looked at all the curtains and window coverings and things and all clean and fresh paint.  I'm guessing the ceiling tiles absorbed a lot of smoke previously.  minor but noticable\n2. definitely \"on a budget\" decorating so kudos for trying to put out white table clothes and padding underneath but if you can't iron the creases out at least 86 the plastic flowers on the table.
