I was very disappointed with the blue man group. \nI guest I was too hiked up about the show since it's showing in so many cities. It could also be,  I was annoyed by 3 drunk mid ages ladies who was sitting in front of me. They were so drunk that they keep standing up and dance during the show. Sorry ladies, it's not a club and it's not a concern. Please be considering and don't disturb other people who also pay the same amount of money for the show. \n\nYes, at the end of the show. They have a lot of paper towels roll down to the front roll...and Yes, 1 of the lady were laying down rolling herself on the floor in those paper towes. \n\nSigh!!! Luck me right...
