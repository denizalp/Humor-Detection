I was craving a Pastrami or Corned Beef Sandwich, so looked to Yelp to find me a good new purveyor of one off the Strip and where a person could dine inside.  So, after looking at some glowing reviews, off I went by myself for a heavy lunch at Rocco's.  \n\nIt took me 10 minutes to figure out how to open the cap on the Nestle Pure Life water bottle I bought here, but that was about the only snag during my visit.  I had the best of both worlds by ordering a Regular 8-inch Pastrami & Corned Beef Sandwich with Homemade Potato Chips.  Although it took awhile to get a sandwich, it was well worth waiting for.  My Regular contained about a pound of meat, and I was told that a Large yields about double that amount  What I was ultimately presented with was a nice, very soft bun filled with warm, well-mixed meats, melted Swiss Cheese, and refreshing cool Coleslaw covered by a tasty Russian Dressing.  There was no grease and both pastrami and corned beef were very lean but still moist.  The sandwich was truly excellent, and I devoured every morsel!  It really didn't need any mustard after all.  The Potato Chips were good, but next time I will order the French Fries, which looked even better.  \n\nThere is no waitstaff here but one receives very good friendly and personal service from the lads behind the counter, including a knife and Spicy Mustard furnished quickly upon request.  Most staffers did not know the price of this Italian deli's products well, which were not marked.  So the prices had to be looked up on the cash register.  Most packaged and canned food items on display (e.g., sardines, pastina, and canneloni beans) that I inquired about turned out to be priced at $3.99, which is rather steep.  But no one twisted my arm to buy anything, and there is something to be said for the convenience of picking up some original made in Italy treats.  So, I purchased a box of pastina.  \n\nA yelp check in here can yield some complimentary dressed up Doughnut Holes, which I think is a generous gesture by the business.  But just before I left, I saw one of the employees behind the counter lick his finger after sampling a pastry treat.  Then he opened the register with the same hand.  So there is room for some improvement in hygiene here.  But the pastrami and corned beef are ample cause to lure me back, and I highly recommend this place to all pastrami and corned beef aficianados.  Fetching-looking fresh baked goods beckon for those with a sweet tooth as well!
