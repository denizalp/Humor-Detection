I can't believe I've never stepped foot in this place until most recently! \n\nI felt like a kid in a candy store!! \nSeriously so many alcohol choices! \nRed wines, white wines, dessert wines, cooking wines, beers, hard liquor, OH MY!\nWhat got me is the whole aisle of Moscato, aka MY AISLE! Different years to choose from, they also had white or pink! \n\nReasonable prices, especially for the different years of the wines.. \n\nI see myself going back here for my Moscato needs!
