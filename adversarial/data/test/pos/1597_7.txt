Ghetto.  It felt like something that would have been REALLY cool if I were 19 or 22 or so and wanting to party\/dance my face off bouncing around with other really excited sweaty folks.  But I'm not 19.  I'm not 22.\n\nThe rooftop could have been nice...  but when we went, it was packed with very little air anywhere (and yes, it's outside on the roof... and it was that packed).\n\nNo thanks.
