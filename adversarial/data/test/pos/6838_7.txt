I finally made it to this Chompie's location... and just like the rest of the Chompie's I've been to, it goes to the category \"Best Deli in AZ\" - still not New York, and I think I may even prefer Goldberg's in Atlanta, but in Phoenix, Chompie's is the place!\n\nWe were there for dinner and I did order one thing that I never ordered from Chompie's before... Sweet Potato Fries!  Yes, Chompie's has pretty good sweet potato fries - yay!  I filled up on pickles and I also had a salad and a scoop of their whitefish salad.  (I probably would not order that again).  \n\nStick with knishes, bagels, sandwiches, and even omelettes - you'll be pleased.  Oh - and I cannot forget their soups... especially matzah ball and kreplach - yummy!  And if you have a sweet tooth, there is PLENTY to choose from!\n\nNow I'm craving Chompie's again... I have to figure out which location is closest to my new digs!
