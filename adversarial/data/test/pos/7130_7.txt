The only reason I am giving this 1 star even though I will probably go back to do some shopping for packaged food and such from time to time but will NO LONGER be tasting the free food is the fact that I witnessed one of the food tasters blowing her nose while standing at a food tasting table, and NOT only did she NOT wash her hands, but she did NOT change the plastic gloves that she was wearing before continuing to handle food to give out as samples. I was so stunned that i just had to walk away. Yes it was my fault for not bringing it to a managers attention but if you could have seen the stunned look on my face. She did not notice me but I damn sure noticed her. STUNNED! I remember exactly what she looks like and will be reporting her but again just stunned that she did that in plain view of everyone. Can we say blech?!?!
