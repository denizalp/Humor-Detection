We all loved this place.  Everything was very good! The portions are huge too.   As in other reviews the garlic knots were amazing.  The stuffed pepper appetizer was the best he ever had, according to my husband.  My youngest loved the pizza.  Their sauce has an excellent flavor.  I highly recommend this place!
