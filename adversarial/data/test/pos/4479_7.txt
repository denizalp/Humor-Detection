He was hilarious, insane and uniquely talented.  \n\nWe got VIP seats through a buddy that works for Saxe Productions and were seated in the front row.  I was a little worried about becoming a volunteer on stage and rightly so!  Wally asked us a couple of questions during the show and gave us a signed DVD with juggling balls which was nice.  Then I was brought up for the last act with the crazy percussion gauchos while being mildly grilled the entire time.  At least my wife thought it was funny :)\n\nAs for a quick rundown for the other acts in the show:\n\n- Happy to see the tap dancers, Sean and John, again.  Saw them during Vegas the show and they were a highlight.\n\n- The hula hoop dancer was fine and on par with others I've seen.  \n\n- I had already seen the guy doing the comedy skits with the 4 volunteers in masks during a Nathan Burton performance but it was still really funny.\n\n- The female magician with the disappear\/reappear illusions was fine but the dancing was kind of awkward and strange.  Just stick to the magic!\n\n- The strong man act was good but there's a reason these guys were in Mystere 10 years ago and are here now.  I remember reading a Las Vegas Weekly article about these guys a while back.  At least there's life in LV for ex-Cirque performers.   \n\nBut it's all about the host in the end, WALLY.  The whole bouncing balls on a large synthesizer had me in awe.\n\nI knew what to expect going into the show.  You will be disappointed if you're expecting Jubilee, Cirque, or Phantom productions.  It's in the V theater which is the house of low budget shows.  None of that mattered to me.  I left feeling entertained and satisfied which is a lot more than I can say for other shows I've seen on the strip.  \n\nAs with all V theater shows, sobriety is NOT recommended.
