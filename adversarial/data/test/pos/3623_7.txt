Fantastic! GREAT middle-eastern (Israeli) food! Wonderful, friendly staff. Interesting and delicious pastries I've never encountered before. \n\nIf it weren't named \"Mozart Cafe\" but something like \"Meshugah Moishe's Mekheye Felafel\" I would have discovered this place sooner. But, I guess word of mouth (where the mouth just ate Sabich Pita) is the old-school way to market a business like this. \n\nGood job, guys. I'm coming BACK!
