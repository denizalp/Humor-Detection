We came here on a Saturday around noon for lunch. I hadn't had Mediterranean food in a while and the craving needed to be satisfied, so we decided to give this place a try. \n\nThe inside is VERY small, and there was nowhere to sit, we ended up having to share a table with another group of people we didn't know. Very tight\/small arrangement. The inside was very clean though and well kept. Very bright and lively colors. \n\nThe young lady at the check-in counter was friendly. And they bus your dishes for you, which is always an extra nice touch at these \"semi-fast\" type restaurants. \n\nThe food...was overall just bland. The kabob was decently cooked but had no seasoning. Even the tzatziki sauce was super bland and underwhelming (something I normally inhale and smother all over everything). The falafels were probably the best part of the meal as they were still pretty moist on the inside. \n\nThere are so many places in this area to get kabobs, and I just can't justify returning for the bland flavors.
