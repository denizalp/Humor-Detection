Backyard Taco, you are nowhere near me, but I'm willing to make the long journey for your delicious Carne Asada!!!  Cooked over real mesquite for a perfect smoky blend of flavors.  The tacos are amazing, but I usually go for the burrito, as it is PACKED with tender, juicy, smoky steak!  In fact, typically, I ask for meat only and hold everything else that comes standard, it's that good on its own.\n\nI guess back in the day, the owners started grilling their food for their family, friends and neighbors; and as word grew, people started following them to stranger's backyards just to get some of the delicious food off the grill.  I don't know if this story is true, but I don't doubt it!\n\nThe menu is limited and they obviously stick to what they know best, and it shows.  The restaurant interior is usuall packed with a long line that extends out the door; but don't fear, it usually goes by very quick.\n\nTake the journey if you don't live in the area, you won't be disappointed, I promise!
