If you're not counting calories and you're hungry, swing on by to The Cheesecake Factory. Super cute and spacious restaurant located in the Premium Outlet Mall. The restaurant is very comfortable and is the perfect spot to catch up with your friends, stop by when you get hungry from all the shopping, or when you are craving a piece of cheesecake. They serve anything from fish and seafood, to salads, to sandwiches, to pastas! I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta when I'm here and I've been doing that for the past several years. You can't go wrong. They also have a skinny menu if you're trying to be healthy. Cheesecakes here are also a must. Save your tummy for a slice or take one home with you!
