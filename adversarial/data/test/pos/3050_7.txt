I am obviously in the minority here, as it seems others have had great experiences. But my review is based mostly on poor communication and a lack of professionalism.\n\nStephanie was recommended to me for newborn photos by a friend. I asked my friend if Stephanie did maternity as well and she didn't know but gave me Stephanie's number to inquire. I didn't hear back from Stephanie right away, but when we spoke she gave me a long explanation about why she doesn't like to do maternity shoots, mostly having to do with the fact that she thinks pregnant women are difficult. She said that, since a good client referred me, she could do me a favor and do the shoot. I appreciated her making an exception for me. \n\nIt was difficult to communicate with her in regards to the session. I had questions about wardrobe and concerns regarding the weather. Her replies seemed curt and I almost felt like a nuisance. \n\nMany of the photos themselves looked like they came from a novice, at best. I had shown Stephanie a must-have photo from Pinterest, and an engagement photo, that I wanted to replicate and we didn't even come close. When I told her about them she responded with a bit of a negative, \"no can do\" attitude. I gave no impression that I wanted these to be an \"exact\" replication but her responses centered around the fact that all photographers have different styles and, between lighting and other conditions, it would be impossible to replicate. She also asked why I wasn't just using my engagement photographer if I had liked her so much (because she's back east). \n\nThe session itself was kind of a mess. The forecast called for high winds. I had brought up my concerns 5 days prior to the shoot, but she didn't respond. My hair was in my face for a few shots that would have otherwise been my favorite. My husband was squinting in a few of his shots because the sun was directly in his eyes. Stephanie and her assistant (her husband) have a strange working relationship where they appear to talk passive aggressively to each other and it was uncomfortable for us as clients.They bickered about camera settings, aperture, lighting and positioning, etc. Honestly, it seemed like a bit of a circus.\n\nIt is my understanding that a good photographer can shoot anything even under challenging circumstances. But Stephanie didn't make reference to the fact that her skill level was lacking in the way of maternity sessions until well after the session, just that she didn't like to do them. If she had told me that she really didn't feel comfortable shooting maternity photos, I would have been very receptive to and appreciative of that response and would have went elsewhere.\n\nI always give credit where credit is due, and there are some great things about Lullaby Lane. The price is unbeatable, and she is patient and gentle with newborns. Most of our newborn photos were excellent. My only complaints about the newborn shoot were, again, the strange working relationship between her and her husband, and the fact that many of our shots were with my son in the same blue basket as a prop, despite my requests to change up the basket. So even without the maternity shoot issues, we wouldn't go back.      \n\nWhen Stephanie emailed me recently requesting a Yelp review, I thought it was only fair to share with her where we thought her customer service and communication were lacking. Instead of taking the opportunity to apologize, or even learn from what could have been used as constructive criticism, she responded with an extremely unprofessional and emotional email, full of rationalizations, excuses, and blame towards me. \n\nShe made remarks such as, \"I am stupid\", \"I should have stuck to my guns\", \"You wouldn't take no for an answer\", etc. She basically acted as though I put a gun to her head to do the maternity shoot. She offered; I accepted. And I expected to be afforded the same time and service as any other client once she accepted the job. She rationalized being difficult to communicate with about the maternity session because she \"doesn't usually do maternity.\" That doesn't give you a pass to skimp on professionalism and respect. She used excuses such as, \"You were too far pregnant,\" for the shoot being uncomfortable and not being able to reschedule. But I was about 33 to 34 weeks, followed by a perinatologist, and in no imminent danger of going into preterm labor. \n\nI do think she lacks people skills, and that's probably why it serves her best to stick with photographing babies. But even when she does, she has a strange way about her that made my husband and I feel uncomfortable. \n\nI think Lullaby Lane offers decent newborn photos at a very reasonable price but, in my experience, bargain photography isn't the way to go. You get what you pay for.
