Dropped by one night with Matthew S, and based on the name of the place, I thought the Crooked Cue was a gay bar. Turns out it is a pool hall! \n\nHuge space, clean bathrooms, equipment in good order, and probably about 20 different tables.\n\nThey charge by the minute per table and pints are about 6$. Not crazy. Played for about an hour and a half and the pool cost was ~30$. So at about 30 cents a minute, you better enjoy it.
