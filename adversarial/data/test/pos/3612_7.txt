What the heck is this place?\n\nIf you're previously TakeTomi Village, probably a good idea to take that off your sign. \n\nThis is what it says on their website: Taketomi Village Restaurant - HAKKA INDIAN CHINESE (previously a Japanese restaurant) is the fusion of Indian and Chinese food. If Chinese is what you crave with hot Indian spices, then that is what you can order.\n\nI was also told by a taxi driver that this place had the best chinese soup ever. I had to try it out.\n\nWe walk in and instantly we were confused by the setting. It definitely looked like a japanese restaurant and it was a bit trippy with all the red lighting and red lanterns. It was busy in there! Must be good right? We were taken to a table as soon as we walked in.\n\nWe take a look at the menu and it has a pretty standard menu of chinese dishes but not authentic chinese dishes. \n\nOKAY so we decide to order the Curry Chicken... We ask if the curry chicken is good? Our waitress says \"No one ever orders the Curry chicken here so i don't know\". \n\nUS: ok so what is in the curry chicken?\n\nWaitress: I don't know.... let me ask the kitchen. \n\nUS: Well what dishes are good to recommend? \n\nWaitress: Um i don't know... \n\nUS: Ok maybe this waitress doesn't know what she's doing or she can't speak english too well? Let's flag down another waitress. \n\n*Flags down another waitress*\nUS: Um so do you know what is in the chinese chicken? \n\nOther waitress: UM sorry i don't know. *starts giggling and run off*\n\nBy this time we are completely horrified about our decision to come here and want to flee right away. However we wait out for the food because we figure there's so many people it must be good right?\n\nWrong. The food was bad. The soup we ordered (corn and chicken soup, hot and sour seafood soup) was less than mediocre.\n\nThe mapou tofu and the curry chicken was gross and the sauce was watery.\n\nThe service is terrible because the waitresses don't know anything about their own restaurant dishes. They also didn't have the capacity to suggest popular dishes which is sad for newcomers. \n\nEven as we were leaving with bad taste in our mouth, people were piling in the door.\n\nIf you want my opinion this place has chinese food catered to indian people. The bulk of the people coming in were Indian and clearly they liked it.
