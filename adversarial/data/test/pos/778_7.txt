Friendly husband and wife taqueria team- they emphasize that their tacos are \"Chicago style\" which seems to mean that the yellow corn tortillas are fried. I didn't notice a significant difference in flavor, but the tortillas seemed to hold up better than elsewhere.\n\nThere is a good variety of meats and they all seem to be done pretty well: the asada was solid and the barbacoa was a surprise hit. Not only is it difficult to find barbacoa in Vegas, but flavor is hit or miss. Here, they use braised beef cheek for the most flavorful version I've found. I also liked the texture of the lengua. \n\nIn addition to tacos, menu has burritos, tortas, plates, and Windy City fries- basically asada fries, with sour cream, pico, guac, and your choice of cheeses. The barbacoa was especially good on this, but I would have preferred a different type of fry than the frozen crinkle-cut variety, which were a bit too thick for my liking. Toppings were super generous though, and even the small size will require you to share with a couple of friends. \n\nService was friendly but orders came out a bit slowly- keep in mind that this is a two person operation, so be patient. Food is tasty, wish I'd grabbed a torta to take to work the next day. I'm rarely on this side of town, but I'll be suggesting it to others to check out.
