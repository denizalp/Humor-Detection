I called Mr Garage Door Repair Las Vegas ... United Garage Door showed up for the repair. (Interesting isn't it?)\n\nCustomer service and setting up the appointment was excellent, with a nice courtesy call that the technician was on his way prior to the appointment. \n\nThe technician was nice, professional in the quality of work that I can tell, and fast. The repair was done in just less than an hour. The work he did appears to be very good and the door is quieter and smoother than before. \n\nHowever, aside from the typical attempts to upsell warranties and such (seemingly smart business), I personally like to know roughly all of the potential charges prior to the work being done. The technician explained that I would need a new spring (not a surprise, I figured this), and he recommended I have two springs for my type of door. That seemed reasonable. He mentioned $129 which is what I chose. Ummm, $129 .... EACH. Plus $85\/labor (again not previously mentioned and maybe silly on my part not to assume this would be a part of the bill). Had mentioned on the phone that I had found them on Yelp, seeing mentions of coupons and 10% off, but nothing was reciprocated in regard to this through the conversation or with the technician. \n\nTo be clear, the money isn't the issue, I paid and I had the money. However, having the charge be well over what I was expecting left a very \"lukewarm\" feeling about the service. \n\nThe door appears fixed and running well with a professional job being done. In that regard I'm pleased, just please be careful in understanding EVERY charge that will be coming your way.  It would have been nice to have this all written out prior as to see a rough total (including labor costs AND the 2nd spring).  Thus afterward the \"lukewarm\" thoughts to be kind. \n\nMy apologies if I'm \"naive\" to some of the charges, but I hope this is helpful.
