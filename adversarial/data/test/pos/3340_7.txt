Every time I come to this neck of the woods, I wish I owned a house there..\n\nI love everything about Mitzi. The homemade muffins, the strong coffee, the ultra-creative daily egg specials, the bountiful yogurt options and the non-matching mugs and tables. You feel like you're having brunch at a dear friends' house every time you come in.\n\nCome for brunch and see for yourself. The best breakfast in the City Of Toronto!
