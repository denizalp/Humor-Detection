If you've ever driven past the Rhythm Room and wondered what it's like, I suggest you park your car next time and go inside. You won't regret it. The Rhythm Room is a great dive hidden in Central Phoenix and home to some of the best Blues Singers in the Southwest. We're no New Orleans but with headliners like the King of Arizona Blues, Big Pete Pearson, you don't have to travel to the South to get your fix of Blues. If you get there early and you're hungry for some true home-style BBQ, check out Rack Shack BBQ just outside the Rhythm Room. \n\nThe Rhythm Room is a classic venue filled with true charm and culture. It's off the beaten bath which adds to its charm and I guarantee that you'll have a good time any day of the week.
