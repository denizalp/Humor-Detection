Without a doubt THE worst place to try and rent space from for an event! None of my inquiries were addressed. Facebook-no response! Voicemail-no return call! Email-no response! I left multiple messages. My daughter also tried in vain to get some sort of feedback.\nPlease don't waste your time with these people. Have your event somewhere else. You'll be disappointed right off the bat!!
