Mmmmmm I make a visit here for my Chinese cravings when I am in need of a mouth orgasm. They give it to me fresh, clean, and generous in which I always leave filled up just how I like.\n\nI tried the general so chicken on this last visit and boy I was in a sea of bliss with this delicious dish!\n\nI have been craving it since, I dream of it, I need it, I want it more and more.\n\n\nI have 12 check ins at Golden Flower and every single dish I try is just as Amazing. The staff is Fantastic, the food is top quality and the prices are low for the giant portions.\n\nTheir war wonton soup is a delicious meal in itself as well for those cold nights! It is full to the brim with shrimp, bbq pork, chicken, veggies and wontons! A must try!
