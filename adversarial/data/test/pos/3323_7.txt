We visited Hell's Kitchen on 04.15.18 as a celebration of 2 friends' birthdays and a bunch of other things amongst just hanging out. I have to say that whilst the meal was pretty good, I was slightly disappointed. (A picture & tweet was sent to Gordon Ramsay) - For having a reservation, our wait to be seated was essentially nonexistent. It probably helped that we came slightly early. \n\nMOMENT OF TRUTH: So as it turns out, after being seated and having a really, really wonderful host & server, putting in our orders, it takes 45+mins for appetizers to even come out. Good thing we ordered drinks. Eventually, the food did start coming out. *** seared scallops, beef wellington, and dessert were part of the pre-fixe menu. \n\nDrinks: \nFear & Loathing: A nice sweet smokey drink with Mezcal & various citrus fruits. \nNote from Gordon: A really good drink to have on a hot summer day btw, made with gin, tea, lemongrass, peach & lemon. It's like an adult's lemonade. Also comes with a \"note from Gordon\" which is a nice touch.\n\nFood: \n-Tuna Tartare: It honestly was eaten so fast after I had taken a photo due to a table of 6 very hungry adults - I didn't get to eat ANY. :( I heard it was good though. \n-Pan Seared Scallops: Plated around the plate were the scallops on top of a celery root puree, topped with chives - they were good, not overcooked and chewy which definitely lives up to the restaurant's rep. Middle of the plate were the bacon lardons & pickled granny smith apples - which again, I didn't get to eat because it was all gone right after the picture. \n-Seared Foie Gras: Unfortunately, the foie gras wasn't just seared. It was cooked for so long it lost it's flavor. The outside was definitely overdone & hard whereas the inside with whatever moisture left in it kept it from feeling like biting into crispy bacon. I was looking forward to this A LOT. \n-Beef Wellington: The pastry on the outside was crispy and had a crunch when bitten into while the meat on the inside was perfectly cooked and moist. It was tender and juicy. The potato puree & vegetables with the red wine glace helped cut the meal. It didn't feel too heavy - instead it was a good amount to still be able to walk out and continue the night!\n-Braised Short Rib -x2!: within 6 people, we ordered 2 orders & mine with sauteed spinach (I just can't eat the creamy polenta). It was a little bit more on the salty side which I assume the creamy polenta would help since the spinach was basically drowning in it. I'd still order it again - I just love trying different braised short ribs. \n-Roasted Rack of Lamb: I normally don't eat lamb due to fear of excessive gaminess but I have to say that it was not like that here. Yes, there is gaminess but not to the point where I'd need to switch seats at the table (and yes, that has happened before). \n\n\n** Overall, food was okay! Not something I'd praise and tell people to go try. I'll definitely try other restaurants of Gordon's in the future but overall it was not a memorable experience.
