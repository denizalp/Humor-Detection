I came here on a Sunday for the first time. It wasn't busy and we found a table right away. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The place is beautiful, new, crisp, clean. It makes you feel welcomed. The man begins the counter greeted us right away and was very friendly. \n\nThey have drink specials everyday and Sunday is $5 mimosas. They have a large sandwich menu and is a nice place to have lunch. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie board. They select the items for you. I liked everything except one of the cheeses. \n\nThey only gave us 4 pieces of bread, which I don't think is enough. I liked the bread, but honestly prefer a crispy crostini type bread with cheese and charcuterie. In my opinion, it just goes better. \n\nThe service was good and I would return again.
