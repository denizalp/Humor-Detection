Il Bosco has nearly 300 awesome reviews for a reason. \n\nThe pizza is tremendous in every way. Everything is homemade and you can tell from the vivid flavors. \n\nMr. Forrest and his family operate this gem and are nothing short of wonderful. Having a meal here is like going to a good friend's home for a relaxing, perfect meal. The ambiance is warm and cozy, the music is on point- the service is spot on, and again- the food is epic.   \n\nIt's worth noting that they also do a great job with takeout. Simply place your phone order ahead of time- and when you arrive they will fire your pie- and two minutes later you're out the door.  One other thing I must highlight is the bread you get with dinner. If you are a bread aficionado- you will flip out when you try their house made bread. It's incredible and they would be a successful bakery if all they did was sell that bread. \n\nThe location is great and they also have a lovely patio for dining when the weather doesn't feel like the surface of the sun. \n\nGive this wonderful spot a try. I have tried all the \"best\" in AZ and I unequivocally rate Il Bosco #1.  Try it and you will too. \n\n\n*Bonus pro tip- if you have leftover pizza, for the love of God don't reheat it in your microwave. Either reheat in the oven or fire up your BBQ for a quick warm up. You'll thank me.
