Like the other reviewers, I am a fan of the menu offered at Cafe Rio. This, and many other Las Vegas locations, seem to be lacking direction, management, training and an overall concern for their offering. This restaurant is no different - except for a few very helpful\/friendly staff - the location was very dirty, fountains were empty, floors, tables, and condiment areas were very unkempt and dirty. The wait was longer than 30 minutes and the food was terrible. \n\nAfter taking nearly 40 minutes to get our food the fire grilled chicken in our burritos was burnt. It was pointless to try to fix it now that our lunch hour was over. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that this is the attitude and demeanor of almost every Cafe Rio in town.
