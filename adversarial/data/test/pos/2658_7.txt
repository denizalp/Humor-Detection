Food was mediocre and drinks were expensive. I thought I was getting comp drinks when gambling and was not, due to a policy they say I should have known.  I would have complied, if I knew. I asked, if the drinks were comped.  I feel I was hustled  The front desk responce convinced me to post. I did not have $20 in since I used  a ticket from yesterday.  I guess they penalize repeat busisness. I was planning to visit periodically, but not now.
