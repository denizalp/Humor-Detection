Not a typical place I frequent due to being vegetarian, vegan, or raw depending on what day it is. \nMet up with a group of friends for a special occasion. They do not take reservations so we decided to wait it out at the bar. \n(Lots of beers to choose from)\nWas seated within a very reasonable amount of time. Attentive & friendly staff. \n\nThankfully they had a veggie burger so I wasn't stuck just eating sides.\n(They also have a gluten free menu)\nHad it Rocky Point style without the sour cream and cheese. (guacamole, pico de gallo, & jalape√±o's).\nGot a spicy Michelada to go with.\nWhat a great combo! Very tasty!\nAll in all a pleasant experience.
