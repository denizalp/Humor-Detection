I've been a loyal Bowtie (Chevy) owner for years and have purchased all of my vehicles from Van Chevrolet. You feel like family even as a customer and that's really important to my wife and I. Yesterday when we purchased our Volt it was our first large purchase together and it went as smooth as silk. Jenn traded her Nissan Altima in and now we have an all Chevy Family. I can't tell you how much it means to our hearts knowing that our vehicles have come from a top notch dealership and will be serviced at one of the finest service centers too. We love our General Motors Family at Van Chevrolet and hope that this feedback goes straight to the top!
