This was my first time here but I am a big fan of Portuguese cousine, I love the mix of spices and meat choises that this cousine has to offer. \n\nWe got all the traditional places like the chicken with tomato sauce, white seasoned rice, potatoes, salad, and barbecue style beef. Everything was great! I really enjoyed the food and the great taste of authenticity. Portuguese cousine is usualy not spicy but rich in flavour which is quite tasteful.\n\nThe service here was friendly and they know how to time all the food you order, this is always a great quality to a good restaurant. To me this show they understand the service industry. \n\nI recommend this place highly!
