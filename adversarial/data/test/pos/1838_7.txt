So this is my neighborhood convenience store. It's so close I could walk here - either from my home or when I'm stumbling home from Zipp's after a night drinking with the guys. So on their website Corner Store supposedly sells Beef mini tacos and double meat cheeseburgers. They also sell breakfast kolaches - fluffy dough filled with sausage\/jalapeno sausage, or ham and cheese. Basically Czech meat pastries. That's the perfect world scenario. Unfortunately this one doesn't do that - they only have hot dogs. I've been in this place all different times of the day and night and it seems I always miss the window where they actually HAVE any hot food. Hell I'd settle for a hot dog but they just never have any. Even though this place is 24\/7 who give a fornication if they just have small short windows of time where they actually have any food. That's worthless and useless to me. Ok. You can buy all sorts of snacks and drinks. Also they sell gas. They have a redbox right outside for those people that still rent DVDs. You can give all that to the birds and bees. I want convenience - that's what I want and these folks aren't giving it to me. May Zeus throw lightning bolts and disintegrate this useless Corner Store taking up valuable retail space in my neighborhood and replace it with a REAL convenience store. Take your store and shove it, Valero!
