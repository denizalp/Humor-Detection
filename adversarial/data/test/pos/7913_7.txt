I have an issue with my HOA. I spoke to their receptionist twice on the phone.  She is very friendly but her promises to actually help me were empty.  I have contacted their accounting department twice, leaving detailed messages both times unable to reach a person on the phone.  At this point, I am waiting, and hoping in the dark, as to whether I will ever get the money from my HOA refund problem resolved. \nI feel they don't listen to their clients and I agree with other reviews. They are not there to support the homeowner.
