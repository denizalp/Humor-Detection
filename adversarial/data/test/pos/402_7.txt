Went to Lush~ took my teenager. He humors me and was very patient. The staff was helpful and patient with my questions, and demonstrated different types of scrubs and facial masks. Admittedly I took a trip down memory lane as I frequented Lush while my son was a baby. I wanted to walk out with 200.00 worth of products  but I did not. Just a Elsie the Giraffe and a buff bar that makes your skin oh so soft
