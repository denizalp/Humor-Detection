Tried to be healthy and get a bite to eat here instead of the junk food restaurants at the airport.  Only one person in line ahead of me, 4 employees doing nothing, I waited 5 minutes, got frustrated, and left.  Why 4 employees would waste people's time like that is beyond me.\n\nInstead I went to a Burrito place and overpaid for a boatload of calories I didn't need.\n\nWill I return?  I might have caught them on an off day, so I will try to come here again next time.  For now, 2 Stars.
