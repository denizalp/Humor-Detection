I have severe allergies to gluten and corn. I was pleased when they had a gluten free menu. This turned out to be false advertising however as they clearly knew nothing about cross contamination. I ended up with hours of horrific stomach cramps, and that was the nice part of purging their bad food. Furthermore, the steak was $90. I am used to high prices and good service. In fact, I go to expensive places BECAUSE I have special needs. It really turns me off to pay top dollar and to have full assurances, and then to get so horribly sick. I fed the rest of that expensive steak to my dog. Do yourself a favor, go elsewhere.
