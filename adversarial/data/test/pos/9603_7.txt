This review goes for the club portion of the VooDoo Lounge.\n\nWe arrived about 1230am after leaving the Ghost Bar in the Palms.  I had never been here and wanted to check it out (I am a huge fan of the Ghost Bar and it has a similar rooftop set up).\n\nBoy what a gross experience.  I do not exaggerate when I say this place smelled like vomit.  We paid our $20 cover charges and stepped into the elevator.  It smelt like puke and it looked like there were puke stains that had been poorly cleaned up (maybe from the night before on New Years eve).  Anyways, no big deal.  Its just the elevator right?  Well when we got off the elevator the smell did not change that much.  Depending on where you were standing in the club the puke smell went from strong to mild.  There was a line around the corner for the mens bathroom but no line for the ladies.  I am not a single guy, but for you single guys out there...this place was a meat market.  While in line for the rest room I found where the smell was comming from.  I found 2 piles of puke on the floor, both different colors.  I found another pile of puke shoved in the cornber near the end of the bar too.  On our way out I told the bouncer and he didn't care (not surprising).  Speaking of the puke problem, don't they serve food here during earlier hours?      \n\nConclusion:  While this place had\/has potential it was just disgusting.  Maybe they just did a crappy job cleaning up from NYE.  I heard the Ghost Bar used to be twice as much so a lot of locals frequent this place.  However, we paid the same cover to get into here as the Ghost bar.  If your looking for a rooftop experience GO TO THE GHOST BAR!!!!  I will never come back to this place or the Rio.
