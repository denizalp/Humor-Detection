I would have paid full price and then some for the potential of getting kicked in the face, teased into kissing a girl and having a balance beam fall on me. Is it wrong that I actually had more fun at Absinthe than at Cirque? Well, I'm just putting it out there. I did! And I'd go again, and again. \n\nGuys and gals will equally be tickled by the array of pecs, packages, pasties and primed abs. Oh come now, you know you wanna believe that that hot Eastern European acrobat is making eyes at you between the sets of acrobatic, comedic, burlesque. \n\nOthers have mentioned how to get to the tent, but I'll just add, it's a minimum of 5 minutes in a full speed walk from Max Brenner at the other end of the Forum Shops to here. If you purchase your tickets from one of those ticket resellers, you still need to go to the box office 1 hour ahead of time to pick them up. And don't underestimate the line of people waiting to get in for general admission when the doors open 10 minutes before the performance starts. But don't worry, I don't think there's a bad seat in the house.... except maybe a few of the ones of the front row ones... unless you don't mind being roasted by the hosts and almost kicked in the face. We were there on a Saturday night, and at the tail end of the line, and still managed to snag seats in the middle of the action.\n\nWarning: Don't bring prudes. They say it right at the beginning, but someone who doesn't find sock puppets enacting sexual encounters, does not belong in this room.
