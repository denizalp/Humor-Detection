Overdue review! I'm sorry! But a good one!\n\nA fella brought me here a while back with the promise of \"This is a great dive bar!\"\n\nRight. You want to bring ME to a DIVE Bar? Weeks into knowing me. Maybe week two? Anyway, I'm glad he did. This place is great! I tell everyone about it. \n\nSure, the parking situation is a stretch, where you're often on a side street. And yes, the outside makes you think you're entering an old man bar. (There isn't much to see from the front. Just the sign and dark windows.)\n\nWalking in I exhaled a sigh of relief. This is not a dive bar. This is a laid back place. On the small side, where you can relax. Nothing pretentious with a mock fireplace, pool table and juke box. There couches facing the fireplace are perfect for intimate conversations. The overall volume of the bar side is suited for talking as well. \n\nI was stoked to see how many different beers were on tab. However, as my fella was the one picking up the drinks I can't speak to what exactly is carried. Except that I liked everything I drank. (But then again, I've never met a beer I did not like :)\n\nThe other neat thing I noted about the pool table area was the diversity of ages. This is a place you can bring your family when they're in town. It's not a dirty, gross bar where Mom will run screaming to the car. It's ok for Dad to hang out and play pool, while wearing his uber cool tennis visor. No one cares. Hipsters, people right off from work, parents, overdressed Irene, everyone, fine. This was a great place for a date.\n\nAnd beer!
