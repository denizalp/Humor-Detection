I've quickly become a fan of French Connection, or as the kids call it these days FCUK. \n The sales people are nice and knowledgeable, the merchandise they sell is very comfy and soft. I walked around and found a beautiful pair of silver slacks on sale for $19.99-- of course it was all too big for me, but so is life.\n My wife tried on a few things. We didn't buy anything and we are glad we didn't as we went to the FCUK outlet store the next day and scored!
