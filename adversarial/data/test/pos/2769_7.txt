I went to The Burgernator for a late Sunday lunch with my husband Matt B. and our friend Liz L. while we were visiting Toronto. We all wanted to check out Kensington Market before leaving town, and picked this place because it seemed fast and easy and my picky husband was craving a burger.\n\nIt was a cute casual restaurant, with friendly counter service and self seating. The walls were blackboard black, and the menu and a Burgernator manifesto were printed right on it in cheerful white lettering, along with several burgery little graphics. The place was quite busy, even at 2:30 in the afternoon. By the time we got up at 3:00, it was full. Some woman actually asked if we were done eating like the second it looked like we might have stopped chewing our food. We said yes before recognizing how weird and rude that was, and gave up our table for her party.\n\nThe food was tasty and satisfying. There were over a dozen burgers on the menu, most of them B.M.D., or \"Burgers of Mass Destruction,\" made with 6 oz. patties (hardly killing anyone) and creative combinations of toppings. There were also a handful of burgers in the Classic Arsenal--4 oz. patties, by-the-book toppings--as well as a couple of vegetarian options. With the exception of the eponymous Burgernator, a monster with three patties between two grilled cheese sandwiches, all of the burgers were $10.99 or less. I got the Captain Jerk, a B.M.D. with an all beef patty, grilled pineapple, havarti cheese, lettuce, tomato, and jerk sauce. This was a great fast food style burger, with decent juice to the patty and nice flavor from the pineapple and spicy sauce. Matt got the classic Commander and enjoyed it, and Liz was impressed with her veggie burger. The sides were also solid. The homemade fries were crispy and well seasoned, and I was happy to get some poutine while in Canada. The General Poutine came with house fries, melted cheese curds, and homemade gravy, and it was a salty, cheesy, gravy-soaked mess that really hit the spot. For some sugar, I liked the vanilla milkshake, which I kept stealing away from Matt. It was sweet and creamy and reminded me of McDonald's, but like rosy childhood memories of McDonald's.\n\nThis was a great spot for a quick meal, and I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for a burger. The only real downside is that you can't get a beer, and you might get chased out of your seat by a lurking stranger. Think of The Burgernator as a hip fast food joint and you should be pretty happy with your meal.
