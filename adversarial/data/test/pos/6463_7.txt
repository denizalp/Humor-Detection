Selfish. Inconsiderate. Crooks.\n\nDrives around in their tow trucks with giant polish metal (size of the back of the cab section of their truck) with their logo on the back, so it is a huge reflective surface that blinds other drivers behind them.  Looking to cause an accident so you can be there quickly to tow the car?  [I had something here that starts with an \"A\" and ends in a hole] business owners!  These jerks probably are not even smart enough to be aware that they are causing dangerous driving conditions for other motorists (that are rely on for business no less) on the road.\n\nIf you need a towing service, look elsewhere.  Avoid these inconsiderate morons.
