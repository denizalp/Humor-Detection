We went to District One Kitchen & Bar for happy hour on a Wednesday evening.  We sat at the bar and the enthusiastic charming bartender was very friendly and told us what he recommended. Due to being so famished, we ended up ordering everything on the happy hour menu.   Everything was wonderful and delicious.  My favorite was the wings which were spiced to perfection.  Make sure you try the tacos, they were simply amazing. I will definitely go back to try some of the other sea food on their menu.
