Awesome. Dark, dank, fun and tourist friendly. It's right behind Stratosphere and across the street from Olympic Gardens. OK don't run around the place naked holding hundred dollar bills, just park and get your pale ass inside. They are supposed to have the very best karaoke in all of Las Vegas on weekend nights. It's on our list to check out. Maybe because we were there in the day time, we see this as a daytime place but it seems seedier in the day. This is what you want from a shady, dive bar. It feels like it's been there as long as it looks like it's been there... Since the late 60s perhaps.\n\n-Update. Ok this place is even better on weekend nights. The Karaoke is GREAT! Old dudes singing old tunes, young folks singing old tunes. It might just be the best Karaoke in town. Dino's is jumping on a Saturday night, lots of single girls (every place on earth has single dudes so it goes without saying that there were dudes here), lesbians (some making out here and there), drunks, chain smokers, you name it? They must not have any ventilation at all so you will absolutely smell like an ashtray in the morning but grab your vocal chords, your gas mask and your drinkin' shoes and give this a try.
