Went in for a standard blow-out after a keratin treatment - expected a round brush and the works in preparation for an interview.  I had gotten the keratin to improve the frizz and texture of my hair.  The person assisting me assumed I wanted it straight because I had keratin applied, and dried it without a round brush - could have done it myself.  When I questioned what she was doing, she had to go back and try and turn the ends under with a hot iron and add volume with powder.  It turned out ok, but definitely not the sleek, interview-ready look I was anticipating.
