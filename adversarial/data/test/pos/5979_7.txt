HIDE YA KIDS, HIDE YA WIFE, cuz they rapin' errrbody out here... with these ridiculous prices!\n\nBeing hungover and wanting some pho like I usually do after getting drunk, their food is not bad at all, but $15?! that's like three bowls of pho\n\nAside the decent food, their service sucks. Service is slow. It takes forever to be seated. Water is never refilled.
