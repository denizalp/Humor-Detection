Will never be back here. I had a promoter who hooked my group up and we came at 1115 heading to our line when this female security officer told my friend that she needed to make sure she had pasties on because \"we don't want the girls out\" and my friend hesitantly laughed and said yes I have them on.\n\n Then the lady looks at me and asks to see the back of my swim top. She then stated my suit wasn't a suit BC it didn't have a clasp. Then asked to touch the lining in my suit and was like I don't want to touch your boobs but I have to feel the lining, where's the lining? I said under my titty. Like what's the problem I'm thinking?? So she feels it and goes no that's not a swim top. Doesn't feel like it. I said yes it is. They make tops for ppl with my cup size different. She goes I have big boobs too I'm a DDD. I said ma'am I'm a size K. \n\nWe do not have comparison in our sizes and how they make our clothes. She goes I can't let you in with that. So we didn't get let in! Lol complete joke and waste. We waited for our Lyft in the same area figuring out where to go next.\n\nIn this span of maybe 30 mins literally 25 ppl rejected. I asked ppl why and they said the same thing the lady didn't think their suit was a suit BC she didn't see clasps...\n\nLiterally everyone rejected was black or brown. They let ppl in with thong suits and jeans. \n\nMy nipples and areolas are completely covered and wasn't let in. \n\nWon't ever try to go back. There's a lot worse they let in.
