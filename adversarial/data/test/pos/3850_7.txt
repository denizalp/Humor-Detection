#1. Check in at 4 pm?\n\n#2. Room service barged into the room about 15 mind after we checked in with absolutely no knock or announcement. . \n\n#3. No fitted sheet on the bed and a dirty dirty dirty bed skirt. . . . \n\nShould have left at three strikes unfortunately it continues. . .. \n\n#4. A past guest or house keeping used toilet paper to cover the cracks in the window binds?? Seriously? Tp? \n#5. Maybe this was my fault maybe not... What good is a kitchenette with no utensils? ? I have a fridge, a stove, two butter knives, two forks and one spoon..... \n\nHow can I cook anything without pots and pans?\nIs a kitchenette with no pots and pans typical? \n\n#6. The hotel was empty when I checked in on Thursday. . Yet for some unknown reason they put me in a room right next to a ridiculously loud gate to outside. . What's the point of A gate with no lock?\n\n1st night I woke up at least 4 times due to the stupid lock less gate.. Day 2 I used my pocket knife to fix useless gate... \n\nBottom line. . If your on the fence. . I suggest you don't stay here.. I will never return and I would not even recommend this joke of a hotel to my worst enemy. . \n\nSave the headache and go to an actual resort.. \n\nI want to go to the wynn soon just so I can get the bad taste our of my mouth..
