This restaurant was not for us. The menu was limited and did not offer traditional Italian Americans food. I ordered spaghetti and it was over cooked and the sauce was not great. My BF ordered mushroom risotto and it was bland and looked like slop. The bread was average and the wait for the food and the check was long and unacceptable. There are other decent Italian restaurants in the Charlotte area, try one of those, I do not recommend this place to traditional Italian.
