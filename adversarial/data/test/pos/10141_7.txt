Every time I drive past Schreiner's, I wondered what lived inside this wooden red cottage. I knew it red sausage on the sign, but it just didn't seem big enough to be a butcher's shop. Well, I am happy to admit that I was wrong and that Schreiner's is the perfect example of big things sometimes come in small packages. Schreiner's may not have a ton of flare, but they have everything they need in the gigantic flavor found in their sausage. \n\nThis sausage shop might not be more than 1,000 square feet, but it's overtaken by two large glass cases full of every cut of sausage imaginable, including ground sausage and yes, even bacon. They also have slabs of delicious cheese, garnish to accompany sausage (such as sauerkraut) as well as condiments such as a delicious chipotle mustard that I purchased. \n\nI taste tested a couple different pieces of sausages thanks to the display of samples and decided to go with the Polish Sausage to BBQ. It was less than $3.00 for two sausages and let me tell you, they were large and in charge sausages. They were full of flavor and just the perfect amount of spice. \n\nI will definitely continue my visits to Schreiner's and I'm happy I finally stopped in to say hi to this little cottage!
