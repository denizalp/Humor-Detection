Very convenient location inside the Fry's food store. There's a closer one to my house, but I was already in this shopping area. I needed to add an account and Jamie was very helpful. Our conversation didn't feel forced and I enjoyed chatting with her as she asked me questions about my savings and spending goals. I was able to resolve what I came there to do and then did some shopping afterwards. Gina was also super friendly. Banking and shopping in one stop!
