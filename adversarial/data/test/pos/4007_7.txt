I've only been here twice. It's a very cheap place to have a drink. Which is good.\n\nThey must not make enough money to run the A\/C because it is so hot in there and they have a big fan running instead. \n\nThe pizza I had didn't impress me. It tastes like cheese substitute that comes from a bag. \n\nThe bar is very dated and not in a charming divey way but in an economically depressed way. The bar feels dirty and I imagine it looks worse with bright lights. Good thing it's dark.\n\nI never come here and I won't likely be a regular.
