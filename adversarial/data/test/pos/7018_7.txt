Do you believe in Yin and Yang? The ancient Asian philosophy suggesting polar opposites are interrelated? \nIf you don't, then you best start believing in it if you're headed to Flo's.\n\nThe manifestation of Yin and Yang is clearly present...like 'in your face' present when you're here. You'll see it from the moment you're seated, but you need to be observant...in tune...at one with the universe.\nLook around.\nNotice anything?\n\nLike the couple who was seated five minutes after you were. See how they're now eating something and enjoying their experience?\nAnd what's the opposite manifestation? Your Yin to their Yang?\nYou guessed it. \nYou're boiling mad, no beverage, food or server anywhere on the horizon.\n\nBut don't be mad. Look for the zen in all of this.\nTry to think in terms of the great Yin and Yang. \nCalm yourself by reasoning how you and your date actually sacrificed your good time  in order for another couple to be laughing, joking, eating, and now, sipping cocktails as part of their good time.\nThis is the great balance in life.\n\nNow you try.\nGo ahead..it's easy.  \n\nAfter dinner, when the bill comes, simply stiff the waiter on the tip.\nYou'll be happy you did, and now, the waiter will be pissed off...just like you were throughout the dining experience.\nYet another example of Yin and Yang.\nBeautiful, isn't it?\nAre you seeing the zen in all of this yet?\n\nOh, and one more thing.\nDespite your poor service, you'll find the food is really quite delightful.\n\nFlo's really does provide the full Asian experience.\nTruly, the manifestation of Yin and Yang.\n\nKudos Flo!
