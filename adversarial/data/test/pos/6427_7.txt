Me and my friends wanted to try this place for the longest! We finally found a day perfect to meet up at this place. All of us order a bowl of ramen and was looking forward to a great bowl of ramen based off of the reviews that we have seen. \n\nWe all ordered the Tonkatsu ramen. When we first tried it, we weren't impressed at all. To be honest, it was very hard to even finish the bowl. We weren't the type to stop eating completely and ask to take the ramen off the bill but we had to! We couldn't take more than 3 bites. \n \nThe ramen soup was very bland. All you can really taste is the large amount of sesame oil that the soup and ramen were drenched in. It was very bad. The noodles weren't even traditional ramen noodle. I don't see how other reviewers gave this place such a good review.. Maybe it's bc they haven't tried good ramen before or even tried ramen period. Don't waste your $14 for a bowl of ramen here that's all I can say
