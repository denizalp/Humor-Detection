Finding an honest and reputable auto repair shop can be a challenge, but Korner Kwik Lube more than meets these requirements. The manager is a nice guy with a sense of humor, and I was seriously impressed with how well the shop treated my husband and I on our first couple of visits. On our first visit, we arrived because we were having trouble getting a car battery properly installed. It wasn't sitting right, basically. The employees quickly got this problem fixed and to our shock, we weren't charged for this. On the second visit, we had an inspection to see if our car had a leak problem. The answer was yes, but again no charge for this inspection. Wow!  \n\nOn our follow up visit, my husband's vehicle mystery leak ended up chalking up $400+ in repairs. We got a quote beforehand from a local dealership in Centennial Center, and were quoted over $200 what Korner Kwik Lube quoted us. So, it's safe to say that this small auto shop is easier on the wallet and doesn't overcharge customers. In addition, Korner Kwik Lube goes beyond what any other shop offers, at least in my experience. My husband was offered a ride home while his car was in the shop for a lengthy visit.\n\nAny time our cars need some work, I'll be coming here. Really, I refuse to go anywhere else now.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #8
