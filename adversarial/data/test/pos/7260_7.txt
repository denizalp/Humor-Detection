Called and asked them to stay open a few extra minutes after close because I was on my way and got stuck in traffic. The guy on the phone said \"probably not\" with no other explanation ... Honestly not the end of the world, but one star for being super annoying and not knowing how to speak to customers over the phone. Was about to buy a couple hundred dollars worth of product for a party and had every intention of tipping generously for the favor of waiting a few minutes late... Please try harder.
