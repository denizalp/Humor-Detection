I am giving this 3.5 stars and rounding down.\n\nAfter Chef Bartolotta won the James Beard award for the Southwest I made a reservation here.\n\nWe started with some soft shell crabs and I was very disappointed.  I have had a lot of softshell crab recently because it is in season, but this one was not that good.  Not sure if it was the crab or the preparation but it was definitely not juicy like it should be and it was a little too crunchy.  \n\nI ordered his \"signature\" ravioli and my companion ordered something like spaghetti with meat sauce (sorry I don't remember the name).  The ravioli was very, very rich. Too rich for me and I like rich foods.  The other pasta, however was excellent.  \n\nThen the star of the meal and what they're famous for is the fish from the Mediterranean Sea which they bring in daily.  They offer a wide variety of fish, preparations, and sauces.  I went with the sea bream and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfectly executed and I really enjoyed the sauce with fresh tomatoes in it.  The tomatoes tasted like San Marzanos.\n\nThe service was pretty good.  Our main server was very helpful and knowledgeable but the other one who comes by to fill the water and other stuff was slow.  I was thirsty throughout the meal but couldn't figure out where she hid our water bottle.  \n\nI can't remember if we got dessert.  Total bill for two was $250  (no alcohol).  I'll probably be going back - I wanna try more of their pasta.  Maybe I'll order it from the bar if that's allowed.
