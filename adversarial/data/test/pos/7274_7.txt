The garden section here seemed smaller than at other locations, although it could be due to the summer heat that not a lot of plants can be offered. Service was fast and friendly though and we did get asked by an employee if we needed anything (Sometimes they'll go out of their way at these stores to not give you any service haha).\n\n3.5\/5
