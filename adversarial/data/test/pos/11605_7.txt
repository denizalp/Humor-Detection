Unprofessional doesn't begin to describe this clinic. I got a referral a month ago and no one has called with an appointment. I've called multiple times - no answer. I've left multiple messages and calls remain unreturned. I guess they're too busy ripping people off with Botox injections and chemical peels, that no one has time to look at my psoriasis.  This place should be shut down.\n\nUpdate: haha, literally as soon as I post a review, they call me to book an appointment. I guess you gotta hit where it hurts to get anything out of them.
