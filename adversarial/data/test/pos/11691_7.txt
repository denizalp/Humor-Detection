EDC Vegas is an experience of a lifetime.  If you love anything House, Trance, Dub-Step, or electonica you owe it yourself to get high with your senses and just let the music take you to an epic journey...or if you're just a raving mad raver this is your mecca so take pilgrimage and pray to the gods of DJs.\n\nIf you're a single guy, beware, there's enough scantily clad, almost naked women, here to blow your glow-stick.  Yeah there's a lot of candy-poppin' but everyone here is extremely friendly and just in general enjoying the good vibe and the euphoric feeling they're getting from the music or whatever it is they're swinging their glow-sticks at.\n\nINSOMNIAC, certainly impressed with this fine production.
