This place was like a ghost town when I walked in. But that's ok on account of my general dislike of people. It was clean and after rubbing sleep out of her eyes, the lady behind the counter greeted me.\n\nI'd like to preface this part of my review by letting ya'll know how much I hate onions. I can not convey enough how disgusting I find white onions, green onions, red onions, leeks, chives, scallions or anything in the onion family. (It's really hard to order most foods but I digress.) I give the menu a rundown and notice that it's less expensive than most chinese take out places and the cheap ass inside me smiles. I order the lunch special ($5.75!) and a side of lo mein. Then I give the lady my No Onions Please speech. She's like, \"Oh no problem, we don't put onions in our food.\" I swear to you, the heavens opened up and and a chorus of angels started singing \"Hallelujah\". You have no idea how rare this is. People put onions in EVERYTHING. But not this place apparently.\n\nSo while I'm mentally planning my wedding here, the lady tells me it'll be a five minute wait, which is slightly optimistic, in my opinion. 15 minutes later my food comes out but I'm not even bothered by the amount of time it took since I was still on my onionless high. And the food was delicious. \n\nSo yeah, I'll be back and I recommend, this place to anyone who likes cheap tasty chinese food. I especially invite my fellow Onion Haters to try this place. They get us.
