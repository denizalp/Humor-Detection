4.5* rounded up because the round dough with holes in the center trying to pass for bagels in PHX & Las Vegas are so severely lacking in any semblance to what they are supposed to be, that when I find a place like this, after kissing the ground like the Pope, I round up. The Man knows how to make bagels, people. And bialys! Bialys, I tell you: I wanted to cry when I saw them. \n\nAnywho, my SILs have lived in the 'Tuk forever,  when we moved here they told us see the Man about some NY style bagels. The first time we went it was at opening, and our bagels were still hot! The salt and pumpernickel are my favorites; Scott is an everything or egg man: \"Goo goo g' joob\" (that's the Beatles, millennials) When my Mom was here, she asked for bagels every day: Brooklyn born and bred stamp of approval!\n\nThey do run out of bagels early, you will encounter a line occasionally, but they move quick. 5* as good as it gets in PHX fo sho! \n\n* closed Mondays *\n** they have deli sammies **\n** breakfast menu ***\n**** nice lox and yummy homemade cream cheese varieties ****
