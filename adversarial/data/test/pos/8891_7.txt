There is no guarantee of tomorrow. It is so important to make the most of each day and night. My dear friend Christie and I made the most of last Friday night when we met her lifelong friends at PBR Rock Bar.\n\n   From a local's perspective, driving to PBR Rock Bar is a nightmare. It is not like the Voodoo Lounge or Level 107 Lounge where you pull in from a 4-lane arterial into a well designed parking garage. The local has to maneuver through the mayham of the Strip area traffic. The worst part is maneuvering through the Planet Hollywood\/Miracle Mile parking garage. It is a poorly designed parking lot without notice that the motorist is driving the wrong way. Once the local finds the parking spot, it is a walk through the corridors of Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood to reach PBR Rock Bar where the mall touches the Las Vegas Strip. Now, If your vacationing on the Strip, PBR Bar is a short walk off the sidewalk.\n\n  PBR Rock Bar is really two different bars under one business. You have the indoor bar and nightclub overlooking the mall and the outdoor bar and nightclub patio overlooking the mid Strip. This is where the high energy is. When you look up you could see the Cosmopolitan tower, when you look straight you see a Las Vegas Strip bordered by Planet Hollywood and the Cosmopolitan. In the near distance the intermittent Bellagio Fountains dance and the Eiffel Tower stands tall. In the near distance, the sidewalks are prime people watching. Looking into the bar, there stands the mechanical bull. The mechanical bull is really a symbol of their business practice. They really take the customer for a ride by charging different prices for the exact beverage. That is bull!  In hindsight I regret not riding the mechanical bull. I think it would of been a lot of fun. In reality, my eyes and attention were on my company. The volume of the music was at a decibel where we could hear one another. Christie and I started out in the indoor bar. When you arrive from the Planet Hollywood parking garage, you enter through the indoor bar. From this angle, the outdoor patio is camouflaged by a wall and dim interior. After Christie's friends called her we'd find our way to the outdoor patio. This is where we'd spend around 3 hours of our lives.\n\n    There is an admission price for guys. Even guys who drink girl drinks :-). The admission is $10. But it includes a drink. For the Las Vegas Strip this is a decent deal. The average drink on the Las Vegas Strip is $12. And if I'm not mistaken, a 22 ounce beer upstairs in Twin Peaks is $10. Once your in the bar, a click on the Yelp application illuminates the buy one get one free drink check-in. The average drink is around $12. By the conclusion of the 3 drinks, people ought to be up in Space Mountain-a state of a nice relaxing buzz.\n\n    By the time I drank the three drinks, I was up in Space Mountain enjoying a nice relaxing buzz. I enjoyed two Blue Hawaiins and a Bahamas Mama. Supposedly they are girl drinks. But I got to be a man and tell the truth. They were delicious but nothing spectacular. The bartenders didn't even bother to add a maraschino cherry. They came in a plastic cup. They were a delicious route to get to Space Mountain. They taste like fruit punch with alcohol. Now high up in Space Mountain,  I thought I was being funny and managed to drink Christie's Whiskey Neat. I am no connoisseur on whiskey, but it was decent and put me to the summit of Space Mountain. When I brought Christie, a replacement Whiskey Neat I was incognizent to the idea that the bartender charged different prices for the exact drink. I'd end the night with the least expensive beer. It was PBR. Although I was in no state to keep track of the price, I think it was $5.\n\n  Now back to Earth and off Space Mountain,  when I reflect on PBR Rock Bar, I see 3 stars. I dislike the inconsistency in price. However, there is a high energy level to the place. Its setting on the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of the Cosmopolitan Tower and in the sightlines of The Bellagio Fountains and Eiffel Tower is high energy. $25 for a nice buzz is a good deal. Most of all I enjoy the memories of spending three hours here with my friend and her friends.
