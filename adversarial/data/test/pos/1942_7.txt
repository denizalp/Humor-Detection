Terrible location, terrible service, terrible new less fat fries, terrible in\/out location. I stopped here after making a delivery. I was very hungry and thirsty. I decided to try the new fries and asked for a large glass of ice. I was charged the full price of a drink for just the ice. I wish I just grabbed a plastic bag, dumped the ice in it, and returned the cup. The water - NASTY. I'm not sure what was going on with it but it tasted terrible. As did the fries. They tasted more like chemical mixtures than potatoes. The entrance\/exit placement made it nearly impossible to continue on my route without an illegal left hand turn or a U-turn later down the road.
