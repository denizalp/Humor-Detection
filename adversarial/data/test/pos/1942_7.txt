I have to give this Starbucks 4 stars.  There was no one in line when I entered the drive through yesterday.  The order was taken, the person at the register was very pleasant, and I was on my way quickly.\n\nIt's also a plus that this outlet is in the front of the shopping plaza where I sometimes go to the Walmart Neighborhood Market.  I can get a drink going in or leaving and it's very convenient.\n\nI got my drink in about the same time it took me to write this review!  I'm a fan!
