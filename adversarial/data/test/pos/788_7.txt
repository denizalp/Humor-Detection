This place is a RIPOFF... the manager, Rose, goes to the Fry's down the street and buys the sandwiches they sell for $5, takes them to her shop, cuts them into quarters and puts a markup on them. ALL THEIR FOOD COMES FROM THE DELI AT FRY'S..... \nSave yourself some money and buy it fresh yourself from the grocery store.
