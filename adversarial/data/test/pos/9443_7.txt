My brother and I went there a while ago and I have to say this to everyone.....\nAvoid Via Brasil Steakhouse. The staff was BEYOND rude and I will never step foot in there again. Bottom line was that I was accused of skipping out on a bill that wasn't mine and they just plain Embarrassed me. I asked to talk to the Manager and I have yet to hear from anyone. I will not apologize for yelping nor will I remove this. The Via Brasil Steakhouse NEEDS to own up for their actions. I have NEVER stolen in my life and I have never been accused of it either ......until I went to Via Brasil. You lost a customer forever.
