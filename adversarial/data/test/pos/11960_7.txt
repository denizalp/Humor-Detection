I was pretty impressed by this place. I wasn't very hungry so i knew the small size bowl would be enough for me at that moment. The employee who helped me was so nice and accommodating. I wish i got her name! But she made my order absolutely perfect! Not too much rice with furikake. I requested tuna with NewYork Sauce along with scallop with spicy mayo for my protein. I appreciate that she was very diligent and precise. She even asked if i wanted it to be mixed in different bowls and if it would be ok if she used the same gloves. That i appreciated even though i did not mind at all. Shrimp tempura, and crab meat on the side. I also like that they give u small sheets of nori if you wanted to make a hand-roll. Mini miso soup for dine-in only! \n\nI had to knock off a star because a small was already $9.50 and it is small, of course additional add ons are $1.50 or so.. it does definitely add up.
