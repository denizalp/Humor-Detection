Final Update, re: Jose Torres: This was exwctly my point, the car never should've passed your safety inspection. Selling a car that you knew had an issue (if you didn't know, again-proving my point) doesn't have anything to do with me purchasing an additional extended warranty or not. Since you are choosing to avoid my phone calls now I have filed a complaint with the State's Attorney and BBB. It's unfortunate that after everything all I was asking was for reimbursement of $388, and your dealership showed its true colors with not calling me back when you say you would, not calling back period, and blaming me for your mistake. \n\nUpdate #2: So after leaving message with Sales Mgr (who never called me back), I spoke with Mr. Torres in Customer Relations on April 25th. He told me he would talk to the GM about reimbursing me the cost to fix their mistake and oversight. As of this date I have not gotten a call back from him or anyone from this dealership. It is $388.... I cannot imagine that is a far reach for them to be able to pull to fix a wrong on their part but since they believe brushing me off is better I am leaving this review as it stands. I can't imagine that they'd be so laxed about this if it had happened to us in the mountains and our family of 4 were killed. Safety should be #1 and customer service a close 2nd, this dealership apparently doesn't care for either.
