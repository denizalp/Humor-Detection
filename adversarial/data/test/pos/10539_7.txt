I moved out to Calgary on my own, with my best friend, at the tender age of 19 with my best friend.  For the majority of my adult life, I have lived in Calgary with no family around me.  The majority of the family was in NorthWestern Ontario, which is where I am from.\n\nAbout 10 years into my adult life, my mom surprises me with the most excellent news that she is moving to Calgary.  She had retired from her career, and since I am her only daughter, it made sense for her to come out here.  Even though I live in suburbia, she was adamant she wanted to live downtown, since that is where my first apartment was. She remembered how easy it was to walk for groceries, a bite to eat, or to the mall.  I got to work right away on finding her a downtown apartment.\n\nIn that journey, I came across Terrace Gardens on Sixth, which is a 50+ building right downtown on 6th Avenue.  Compared to the other places I looked at, this was a perfect, obvious fit.  Her neighbors would all be her age or older, and on one of the lower floors (I can't remember if it was the 4th or 5th floor), there was a swimming pool, pool tables and even a large library wtih lots of books and magazines.  It is also a block and a half from Kay's grocery store.  For further comfort, there is also security at the front door, to keep the riff raff out.\n\nTerrace Gardens, at the time, was an absolute pleasure to deal with, and I know that my mom enjoyed her time there as well.
