Been to Five Guys a few different times. The best one was in Wisconsin by my Dad's house. Maybe it was just getting to have lunch with him that made it so special.\n\nThis is another one of those burger chain places where you can have your order tailored to the way you want. Wow ... what a concept!\n\nInside has your basic counter service with a large amount of seating around small tables and chairs. The decorations are simple and they seem proud about who they are and what they do. You will always see several \"Best of ____\" signs plastered all over the walls.\n\nUsually order one of the Burgers and a Dog. The Fries are so big that you can split them with a friend or loved one. The orders will promptly arrive in a large greasy brown bag. Normally tear it open and spread it all over the table. Kinda like camping?\n\nService is always friendly and the food is OK. This is probably not my favorite establishment for burgers or dogs. Everything is pretty expensive considering the type cuisine. Fifteen bucks for a Little Cheese Burger, a Little Fries and a Hot Dog is COO COO CRAZY!\n\nConsider spending a little extra money for a high quality Gourmet Burger somewhere else. There are plenty of tasty places all around this area. Unless you just can't resist the all you can eat Peanut gimmick. PEANUT ALERT!\n\n2.75 STARS
