I love PF Changs and this location is good but the service sucks, I had one server actually have the nerve to say he is too busy and hand me off to another server who was also to busy. Here's an idea, have enough staff to cover your Friday night supper rush. Must be a rude Quebec bad service thing. I've been to this location before and it's usually good but this is not cool.
