I'm not a bad driver. I am a decent driver, and sometimes things just *happen* to my car. Regardless, the men and women of Southwest Collision were good to me. They didn't ask too many questions about exactly *how* I lost that piece off the frame of my Volvo. They laughed when I didn't know my model, but they didn't judge me or treat me with any less respect. And best of all, they accommodated my busy schedule and made the repairs as quickly and efficiently as possible. My car looks great now, but knowing myself, I will probably be back.
