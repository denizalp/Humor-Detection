Still consistent! We came here Thursday night for dinner and Sunday for Easter brunch. Service is still top notch.  Jennifer was our server both times and we love how she remembers us!  Easy going with great service and consistently delicious food!  Nothing is worse than having a great experience one time and returning and having a terrible experience the next. This is NEVER the case at flemings... always great!  From Easter Sunday brunch to thanksgiving dinner to happy hour or even a dinner during the week we always walk away satisfied and excited to return.  Keep it up flemings!
