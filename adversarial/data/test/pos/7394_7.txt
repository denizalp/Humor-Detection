Not wanting the typical fast food choices decided to have dinner at a restaurant that serves \"real\" food. Beware once an individual decides to go Panera there is no substitute. With this being my first experience at this location I was extremely excited to try the food and atmosphere that Panera delivers continually to its customers. \n\nThis store still has that new building scent. The decor of the restaurant is amazing. The booths are so comfortable. The lighting is fantastic and the natural hues of wood that they use make this location amazing. The carpet is even soft and fluffy. When they built and designed this location of Panera, I feel they wanted the customer to feel at home. Which it does the restaurant just needs tele's.\n\nAs I sit here and eat my dinner I have yet to be surprised again with the use of new technology and how Panera is using it. The guest may sit down at their table and order online from the table itself. Basically, the Panera table in the restaurant is the destination of the order. I checked it out you put the table number in that you sit at. How wonderful! Plus, when you decide to order one can do it on a new kiosk electronically in the store, or the good old fashioned way with a real human.\n\nI decided to have the Caesar salad which was very filling and delicious. The Caesar dressing had that proper balance of tang to it. The lettuce was crisp and fresh too. The croutons are made by hand here and one could taste the quality of this. For dessert I ordered a sugar cookie that was in the shape of a tulip. The frosting of the tulip sugar cookie was amazing. This cookie was very soft and fresh. I enjoy knowing what I am eating for these reasons why I continue to trust Panera with the excellence they constantly deliver.
