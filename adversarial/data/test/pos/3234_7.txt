I am a new found fan of Honey Salt!\n\nI came here on a random Monday night and the place was packed. Great vibe, good looking crowd (albiet of the older Summerlin-mom-looking type...Vegas peeps, you know what I mean). Our table wasn't quite ready so we started with drinks at the bar. The bartender was friendly and was definitely hustling because she was the lone bartender at a full bar. They have some yummy specialty cocktails. I had the mickey...2 actually :)\n\nOur food order:\n\n-tuna tartar\n-iberico ham (comes as a plate with cheese and asparagus)\n-turkey bolognese\n-brick oven chicken\n\nI was so full and couldn't contemplate dessert. My favorite bite was the turkey bolognese. Very hearty and the homemade noodles (farro pasta) were perfectly al dente. Note that they were out of the scallops and the chicken curry...at 8pm. So I don't know if those dishes are truly that popular or if their supply ordering was off.\n\nService was good and all the staff I interacted with were very nice. The tables are a little close together but I didn't mind, it made the experience reminiscent of a small NY restaurant.\n\nI will definitely be back :)
