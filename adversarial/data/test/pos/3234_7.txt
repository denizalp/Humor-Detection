Another magnificent landmark in one of the most beautiful cities in the United States.  I truly love Pittsburgh with all of the gorgeous bridges and The Fort Pitt Tunnel welcoming you to the city.  It is a remarkable structure.\n\nMatthew U. said it best...\"The Fort Pitt Tunnel is Pittsburgh\"s Front Door.\"  Why plagiarize...I can't say it any better than that.  Give that man a standing O.....slow clap...
