Did I really just start a yelp business for Thrift King just to make funny references using rapper Macklemore's thrift shop song???  You're damn right I did....\n\n\"What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what.....\nWalk in the club like what up? I got a big cock\nNah, Im just pumped up, bought some shit from the thrift shop\nIce on the fringe is so damn frosty\nThe people like Damn, thats a cold ass honkey\nRollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine\nDressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green\nDraped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me\nProbably shoulda washed this, smells like R.Kelly sheets\n(((PIIIISSSSSSSSSSS))))\nBut shit it was ninety-nine cents!\"\n\nMe shopping at a thrift store?  Never for clothing, but I do like stopping in one occasionally in hopes to maybe find a cool antique, houseware item or other.  I kinda think of thrift stores as like indoor flea markets and I do enjoy checking out a good flea market.  I often donate my lightly worn clothing items I no longer need to thrift stores.  A few days ago I dropped off about 25 items, including 17 old sports jerseys (pictured).  I made my last big donation when I heard last year that a massive apartment fire left 49 people homeless in Swissvale.  I donated 6 pairs of lightly worn Nike sneakers, 2 coats and lots of clothes for fire victims being collected at a local church.  \n\n\n\"Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments\nPassin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in\nBummy and grungy, fuck it, man\nI am stuntin' and flossin' and\nSavin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, bitch\nI'm a take your grandpa's style, I'm a take your grandpa's style,\nNo for real - ask your grandpa - can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)\nVelour jumpsuit and some house slippers\nDookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'\nThey had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard\nI bought a ski blanket, then I bought a kneeboard\nHello, hello, my ace man, my Mello\nJohn Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no\nI could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those\nThe sneaker heads would be like \"Aw, he got the Velcros\"\n\nThe Thrift King - great merchandise at great prices, is their slogan.  They claim to be Pittsburgh's largest thrift store.  This is their second location in a former furniture warehouse, so it is a big store and filled up daily with items such as new, nearly new, antique, vintage, designer and collectibles.  Their other location is in Jeannette.  Like most second hand stores they have a color coded sticker system.  Each day of the week offers a random deal for specific colors.  They have a loyalty program where accumulated points gets rewards towards future purchases.\n\n\n\"I wear your granddad's clothes\nI look incredible\nI'm in this big ass coat\nFrom that thrift shop down the road\"\n\nwww.youtube.com\/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes
