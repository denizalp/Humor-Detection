I've never dealt with a dealership who treated you like they didn't need your business, but these guys have cornered the market on that. I've gone to them twice in 3 years to lease a vehicle and they have the highest prices I found in NC and SC. They don't negotiate. Their solution is to talk you into a car without any of the features you want rather than work with you for a fair price. You'll get a better deal elsewhere! I did - twice!!!
