Talk about another hidden gem in Vegas. I have been meaning too check this place out after hearing the buzz and looking at the pics it all looks really really good. I really am digging the sign\/logo of the restaurant. If that doesn't make first impression from the moment you walk into the restaurant be surprise got upscale feeling too the place, even though bar area not that big really like the set up, and for any sports fan love the fact five widescreen all set up just like see at sports book bunch together. The prices are supa reasonable up and down the whole menu. The portion size for tapas style is really good size more so then other tapas style places been too in my experience. Love the diversity of the menu also wide range from cornish hen, bone marrow soup, more tradition pho dishes, or beef salad. Just talking about the entrees. \n\nI no idea best place too start my District One Kitchen & Bar experience but the Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was on my radar. It the perfect soup too clear my running nose and sinus. Boy did it not disappoint! The broth had nice kick too it. But not over the top that not enjoy the full body of the broth. One of the best things about it is diversity of meats in it. Counted four different ones in the bowl. Really each time dug deep find another different treat in every scoop. It nice hearty Pho dish. Any sign of good Pho is no need too add anything more too the broth. The appetizers was tough but went with the Beef Buns. Talking about Buns in my last review Beef Buns brought back that same urge Bun crazy! They do have peking duck buns too believe but went with the pork buns. Talk about addicting get three per order but popping them down so easy wish order half dozen or hell could have done dozen. Really that good!! The pork is cooked nice crispy outside, moist inside, and glaze or sauce cooked in was fabulous could have ordered plate of pork! The topping of think hoisen or oyster sauce combine with garnish of julienne carrots and couple other things. The steam bun itself was the perfect Steam Bun with the perfect filling. \n\nThe service was awesome. I torn between the tacos and beef buns waiter recommending the beef buns. Save the tacos for next time. No doubt be few more times because lot of good stuff on the menu. Just happen ran into fellow yelpers Misti and Bobby. They were kind enough ask if wanted too join them. It was just me doing my yelp diligent checkout out all the ONO spots in Vegas. Lol!! Impromptu UYE with the one and only Misti Y and Bobby Y. Thanks. \n\nTrust me if not checked out District One you need too. It really good food at reasonable price that we al can enjoy!!
