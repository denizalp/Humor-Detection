When I was little I used to hate this place.  Too grown-up, pizza was \"weird\"....they didn't have Cherikee Red like Caruso's down the block.  Upon further review, the 13-year-old version of me was dead wrong.  It's authentic wood-fired brick oven pizza with high-grade ingredients. The buffalo mozzarella rules, the toppings are top-notch, and the crust is the type you can only achieve with this type of prep and this kind of oven, which is to say it's perfect.  \n\nI especially recommend the patio out back if it's nice out.  Also, the cocktails are shockingly good here. In particular, I'm a fan of the negroni because they chose Carpano Antica vermouth. There simply is no better way to start an Italian feast than with THE classic aperitif drink, and Il Pizzaiolo cared enough to serve a spot-on version.
