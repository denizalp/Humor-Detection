One Sunday we did a Taco showdown of 2 of the more popular taco places in Toronto.  We already did Seven Lives and Grand Electric (plus 2 others we wont mention).  So we decided to try Tacos 101 & Wilbur to see how they stacked up to my experiences in Chicago and San Diego.  \n\nI know there are 3 groups of people who have strong thoughts about tacos... I'll just ignore the ones who dont like them in this review.  The first group is all about the street tacos... the ones you find a mom and pop shop grinding out the best savoury flavours for a few dollars and they dont look pretty but they're just solid with recipes going back generations.  Then you have the ones that are re-inventing them... using the shells as edible packaging to bring out new flavours and visual wow factor.  And then you have people who love taco bell... I'm going to ignore that group too. \n\nWilbur definitely leans towards re-invention... bulgogi taco? kale salads? yeaaah not your typical street tacos.  It's on the nice and hip part of King Street.  It has a great chill and modern vibe.  The place is big and has that modern industrial aesthetics ... exposed concrete walls & pipes, polished stones, with big windows letting in light but it also has some great touches like the huge display in the back with ingredients and bold uses of yellow.  It's a nice vibe and on the weekends, it's pretty chill.  There's a decent amount of seating available from bar seating near the hot sauces to shared tables to smaller 4 seaters.  The restaurant is a fast casual concept so you line up to order and pay upfront but there's table service to deliver the food to you.\n\nBaja Fish - One of the better ones in Toronto!  Served hot and crispy, the tender fish is battered and fried to a nice deep golden brown.  The crunch through the shell is satisfying and its well seasoned.  The addition of finely diced pico (tomato and onion) just helps it a bit.  Im used to having my tacos double wrapped but thats ok... good solid portions.  Like this version.  4\/5\n\nAl Pastor - Another solid taco with tender pork nicely flavoured and contrast with the sweet diced pineapple.  This was a generous amount of meat and definitely overflowed ... even broke through the single taco shell (this is why you need 2!).  I would say it's a hard decision between Tacos 101 and Wilbur for best Al Pastor. Both a good version.  4\/5\n\nWatermelon Lime juice - Love the fact the offer something else than just pop... lightly sweet but lots of watermelon and citrus flavour.  This was very refreshing and would be perfect for a patio drink.  4\/5\n\nYeah it's not your traditional tacos but I do think these were executed so well.  The all you can try hot sauces and salsa makes this a fun place as you can see how much eat you can try before your eyes water and you're dying while coughing.  It's a great spot to catch up with friends and get some solid good affordable food on King st!
