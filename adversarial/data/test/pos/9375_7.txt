OK, just as being a consummate food lover...yeah, buffets shouldn't rank the highest in our repertoire (oh you fancy, huh?) of eats.  But I must admit.  I am an addict.  I am a buffet lover.  How's that for freaky behavior?  \n\nWhat supposedly should be sacrilege for a Yelp foodie, I totally embrace.  There's no shame in my game!  You know why?  Because the majority of us can't afford the experience of frou-frou dining!  Those of you that are fortunate enough to have your pink champagne with your beluga caviar on your toasted crostini are commended.  But I come from a blue collar family so my tastes are a little more adjusted to the broad spectrum of what is out there.  I have no qualms trying a fancy suit & tie place (especially if courted by Jessica Biel), but I absolutely have no problems speaking what little Spanish I know to order a taco from a roadside stand.  Food, I believe, should be full circle, enriched in culture for all, a learning experience from place to place.  It is the one way we earthlings can all seem to communicate.  Plus, you should thank your lucky stars if you can even go to a buffet...many people starve daily!  \n\nWhile the buffets for all of Station Casinos are mostly par for the course, the Feast Buffet at Red Rock Casino is probably my favorite one.  Wanna know why?  OXTAIL, silly!  This is one of only TWO cheap buffets (unless you count the Chinese ones) in all of Las Vegas that have oxtail on their menu on a regular basis.  OXTAIL my friends!  I've loved oxtail since I was a kid for reasons I have no idea.  My Mom hates it (stinky when you are cooking it) but thinks I like it because I used to watch my Dad eat it when I was little.  He must have slipped me some of that broth or something.  I swear it's like ingrained in my DNA.  I've never NOT liked oxtail.  In many cultures it's revered as poor folk food, but honestly if that's wrong...then I don't want to be right.  \n\nOxtail is what you think it is.  The tail of the ox.  It's meaty, but it's also fatty & cartilege-y at the same time.  When it is cooked correctly, it is some damn good COMFORT FOOD.  Usually that involves simmering the oxtail with veggies and spices for a pretty long time.  To get the most flavor out of oxtail you really, really got to coax them.  Most of the better recipes I've seen involve simmering the oxtails for hours on end to enhance it's flavor.  The oxtail stew I cook myself takes a total of nearly two days!  I pan fry then simmer those oxtails for at least 2-3 hours, then let them cool and put in the fridge overnight.  The next day, I will skim off all the extra fat from the top of the pot (although I hate to waste it...so in for fried rice it goes), proceed to make my stew...and simmer it for another 2 hours or so.  It tests your patience for sure, but damn if you make it right it pays off!  Heaven on a plate!\n\nBack to oxtail at the Feast Buffet.  I am a HAPPY man when they do have this on the line (usually in the Asian section and usually only for dinner) and when they do, it is often the only thing I'll eat.  Along with a bowl of white rice and some kim chee on the side.  Thankfully, this Feast Buffet has kim chee too (most times).  But if I'm eating my oxtail, you best sit aside.  I am a BEAST.  I am FOCUSED.  It's primal.  I hate to get graphic, but if your oxtail is good I will eat every last morsel off of those oxtail bones.  It will get sloppy, it will get slippery, it will get slurpy.  Sorry to be so graphic!  But oxtail is often not just fatty, but full of cartilege.  And when that cartilege gets cooked down it gets sticky.  When you have a bowl of oxtail soup or stew, if you don't have sticky hands or lips at the end, those cooks ain't doing it right.  Oh man...I'm smacking my lips now!  *SMACK*  Tasty, tasty!  Thanks, Fergie.  \n\nSo yes, this rating is a bit bias because I like oxtail.  If you don't like oxtail then your rating would probably be lower.  This Feast Buffet has pretty much the same fare as all the other Feast Buffets in town.  And majority of the food is average.  But I will give Red Rock this, their buffet setting kinda outshines the rest.  It's a nice place to eat in with all the modern deco.  If there's another think I love besides oxtail, it's a home with clean lines.  I notice there's a lot less cigarette smoke here too so that's a plus.\n\nThe service for me at least is usually pretty good, fast and very friendly.  The hardest part is the waiting in line!  You could be waiting in line for over an hour.  This Feast Buffet was super popular because breakfast was only $5 per person last year.  Cheap @$$ people like me would line up at 9 AM to save $2 per person on lunch, and stay for lunch!  Guess they caught on and upped the prices a little bit.  Now it's about $7 for breakfast, $9 for lunch, and $14 for dinner with your Station Casino card.  Not bad, but dinner is still my fav meal there.  OXTAIL!
