[pic added]\n\nsimply amazing. \nthere really are no words.\n\neverything was so beautiful: bodies in balance, pose and undulation, exquisite stillness and explosive brute strength. truthfully, i cried about 3 times during the performance.\n\ncolors, lighting, smoke, water, blasts of air and choreography were exhilarating and mind-blowing. raw and throbbing human emotion caught in an imaginary cylinder in the middle of a room.\n\ndamn, i can't even do a cartwheel. let alone, WHILE WET with people's bodies flying around my head, pyrotechnics and other crazy ass shit. it's simply amazing AND gripping to witness. truly breathtaking.\n\nwe sat in sec b, row g. for some reason, the whole row before us was vacant. it was a perfect and unobstructed view. tip: there is a splash zone, so if you're sitting there, DO NOT wear expensive dresses you plan on returning the next day. heh, i overheard a woman bitching out her bf while walking out...\n\ntip: the SO did some online stalking for premium tickets (reg $125 i think) and ended up basically getting a 2-for-1. btw, the \"stage\" in the wynn theater is centered, round and most times aerial, so i assume any seat in the house is an awesome one. so if you're crafty, you can save a lot of money to spend on something else.\n\nfave sequences: men on the tree, the 5 couples falling in and out of love mid-air, water gourds\/nets, girls on the silver orb
