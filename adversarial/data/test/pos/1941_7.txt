What an amazing happy hour!  We got there 15 minutes before opening last night and we weren't even the first in line - everybody clearly loves their happy hour!  We got a great sseat at the bar and ordered up a guava mojito and a glass of cabernet.  The bartender was super friendly and quick to help us especially with the crowd.  We both decided to try the tortilla soup (amazing), iceberg wedge BLT (again, amazing), and share a rotisserie chicken flatbread (imagine that, also amazing!).  The atmosphere is great and it smells so delicious once you walk in.  Great vibe, great service and great food - what's not to like?
