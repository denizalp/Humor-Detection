So I've dealt with this place twice now - I bought my car here and I came for a servicing appointment.  I gave two stars because buying the car was relatively painless, despite me not really liking the salesman or the \"concierge service\" that got tacked on and some confusing explanations on what that exactly entitles to me.  But I'm focusing on the service:\nI made an appointment online, linking from my email I received detailing that my car was recalled and I also should replace a couple filters.  The email was sent apparently because of the concierge service I have on the car.  No reminders of the made appt were sent or given afterwards, so thankfully I keep good notes on a calendar.  I show up to the dealership, and there's no good indication of where I go, but I do see a sign against the wall that says \"Service park in garage\" or something along those lines - all garage doors were shut though.  No one's in line....so I pull up and wait 15 minutes to see if someone comes out to get you.  No one does.  I'm still on-time for my appt at this point, so I get out of the car and walk into the service door - tons of guys just sitting out there, but no one was able to pop out and tell me to come on in?  Anyways, I say I have an appointment, and the guy acts confused (so I'm assuming the website didn't do what it needed to to make the appointment).  I then tell him I'm here about my recall and I needed to get the part replaced in my car.  He looks it up and tells me they're out, and they'll have to order the part.  So I just drove from the complete other end of town where I live for you to tell me that you don't have the part and I'll have to wait until it comes in?  If I was getting concierge service, couldn't they have made sure enough parts were ordered, or called me to say they didn't have it yet?  That's assuming the online appointment maker worked though, so I know, asking too much.  Then they offer to mail me a postcard when the part arrives.  Mail?  There are no faster methods of contacting me to come in to get this replacement, like email or a phone call?  I seriously have to wait for snail mail.  Ridiculous. \n\nI hate complaining about businesses, for every one complaint I feel like I have to go on and rate two other businesses very well.  But man, this just had to be said.  I got pretty angry about it. :P
