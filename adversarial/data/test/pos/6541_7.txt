I must give this restaurant a second visit.  The reviews suggest that we had an isolated mediocre experience.  \nBeautiful day to sit on the patio and enjoy the warm sun and view of the fountains.  A decent, slightly dirty martini and I was a pretty happy girl. \nThen our lunch arrived.  BJ's Cavatelli Pasta & Chicken was pretty yummy, my friend's Salmon Burger was also good.  My steak sandwich was just not good.  The meat was tough and chewy. The frites, however, were delicious.\nWhat I should have done was have a Yelp-recommended dessert.  Instead, another dirty martini.  Out in the sun.  \nCut to Lizzie, heading for un petit somme.
