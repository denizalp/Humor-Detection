Wanting something lighter and healthier to eat after a hike at Red Rock, my boyfriend and I went to Krayvings nearby for some much needed nourishment. \n\nHere's the rundown:\n\nImmune Plus Juice (Small - $6.25) Made on the spot with orange, carrot, ginger, and lemon. This was refreshing.\n\nBison Burger On Fresh Brioche Bun ($10.50): Bland. It certainly needed more of the caramelized onions for a flavor boost.  The patty was thick, small, and crumbled when I bit into it. Definitely not as delicious as their turkey burger, which is a best seller. \n\nChips cost $2. An inflated price tag for a bag that's inflated with 90% air. \n\nThe food here is hit or miss for me; though, the fresh juices and smoothies haven't let me down.
