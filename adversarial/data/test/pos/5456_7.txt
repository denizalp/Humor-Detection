I'm not a mani\/pedi snob.  In the past, I've pretty much just picked whatever was convenient, but I needed a decent job done for a costume I was putting on, and Magen Nail was more than happy to help.  I was immediately greeted when I entered, even though the entire staff was busy.  I put my name on the list and was in the pedi-spa within minutes.  \n\nThe nail tech wasn't terribly talkative, but I can be anti-social when I'm in a new place, so I enjoyed having the time to catch up on the news through my iPhone.  She was quick and efficient, and before long sent me over to get my manicure.  He was also very deft in his work, and I was out an hour later with a much better set of nails.  Thanks Magen!  I will definitely be coming back.
