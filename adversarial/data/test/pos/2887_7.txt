Color Me Mine is a fun, affordable ceramics shop located in Summerlin.\n\nPros - Friendly staff, clean facility and affordable prices. Most of the ceramics available to paint aren't more than $20\/$25.   In addition, it's always a fun activity for the kids. \n\nCons - I honestly don't think they have a wide variety of ceramics to select from compared to other ceramics places I've visited. The prices are indeed affordable, but I definitely think they need a wider assortment.
