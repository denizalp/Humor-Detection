The view is stunning up here!\n\nEven from some of the the restrooms. :P Some had toilets facing the window so that you can look outside even when you're doing your business. \n\nNo cover since we were given tickets downstairs - I think they were trying to fill up the place. Music was okay, drinks were strong (at least mine was), and the room was spacious and not crowded.\n\nIf you're looking for a poppin' club, you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for a casual lounge for some drinks with friends, this might be worth a visit! It's pricey though, like most places in Vegas.
