This was a great hotel to stay in over our Spring Break holiday the rooms were large enough to accommodate 4 guys very comfortably. The kitchen was a life saver as we were able to cook and cut down on food costs which gave us more money to have fun with on the strip. The hotel is clean and quiet, a must have when you get home at 5 or 6am and all you want is a retreat from lights and crowds.The staff here are very friendly and down to earth, every night before we would head out the ladies at the desk would compliment us on our attire and hell who doesn't enjoy compliments? It's far off the strip but the daily shuttle runs at convenient times and can drop you off at the Excalibur and if you're in your 20's you can walk a mile or two. Being off the strip has it's advantages  though you're close to a supermarket that sells liquor! Theres a In N Out and a Denny's a short walk\/ride away which is awesome on a college budget. Yeah when girls asked us where we were staying I would mutter the name but if you have a little game you don't need a penthouse at the Wynn (Though it probably helps). At least we were all comfortable in separate beds and not crammed into a $150 a night matchbox with a view of a wall. Bottom line it was Affordable, Quiet, and Roomy would definitely stay here again if we cant get the Wyndham this year.\n\n*Keep in mind this is a family\/retiree oriented resort so you won't really catch any ladies at the pool unless you like liver spots and wrinkles...\n\n**Ask Fred the shuttle driver about the night he hit it big! Best Vegas story ever!!
