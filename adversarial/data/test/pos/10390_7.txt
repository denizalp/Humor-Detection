This hike is about 5 miles out and back with about 2000 foot elevation gain. Although it may seem like an easy hike, you will ascend almost 1000 feet per mile, so be prepared for a strenuous hike, depending on your fitness level.\n\nThe trail is single file with loose rocks under foot. There is a lot written about the lack of signage and clarity of which trail to take. I believe there must be new signs, since most of the trail was well marked and easy to follow. Only at the end was it a bit unclear.\n\nThere is some rock scrambling and tough ascents, but the views are spectacular and worth the work. Also, the scenery is quite interesting along the way.\n\nparking - small lot, but ok to park on the street if full. $7 entrance fee to Red Rock Canyon
