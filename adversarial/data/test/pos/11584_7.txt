For those directionally challenged, finding this place may be an issue (or we just didn't use our heads). When you turn left into 4310 Sherwoodtowne Blvd, don't park at the actual building labelled 4310. Seriously, we parked and went inside the office building - which, confusingly, lists The Cold Pressery as Unit 5, and almost stepped into the elevators to explore the office building (but we needed a security pass). Walked around the building, still no sign of TCP. It felt like we were on The Amazing Race and we were losing. Until someone told us there's a retail portion separated off from the 4310 building - drive down to the retail concourse below, and it's there. Definitely didn't use our heads with that one - luckily, we finally found it!\n\nFirst, ambiance. What an awesome, laid-back vibe. Relaxing, casual, yet still super trendy.\n\nSecond, the menu. Pretty extensive menu - many options to choose from. We came in for a drink of some sort and ordered, a) The Choco-Maca Shake, and b) The Iced Matcha Latte. The shake is out of this world - you can taste a world of super healthy yet delicious flavours. It's fruity, nutty, chocolatey, hints of almond, not artificial tasting at all, and a really cold and refreshing drink that makes you feel like you aren't drinking something bad for you. On the other hand, the Iced Matcha Latte was fine but nothing spectacular. It was really watery, which may have to do with the amount of ice they put in it (ask for less ice if you get this).\n\nOverall, we found it pretty pricey for the size of the drinks - I didn't think the Iced Matcha Latte warranted $5.00, especially since most of it was very watery. On the other hand, I would pay the $7.75 for the Choco-Maca shake again. You definitely feel like you're getting something more substantial (which matters to me, at that price point, almost $8 for a drink).\n\nSo, perhaps pass on the iced lattes and go straight for the shakes - better value and substance. Overall, a cool place to hang out with friends, grab food or a drink, play some of the board games archived off towards the back of the restaurant. I'll be back to try out more of the smoothies\/shakes.\n\nFor two people, our two drinks cost around $14.00.
