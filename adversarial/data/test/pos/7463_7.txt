AT THE SAPPHIRE, AT THE SAPPHIRE\n\nTheir song has been stuck in my head for the last week so I decided to write the review. What a day. My good friend, we'll call him DJ Jungle Cat, won a promotion they had for 60 Minutes of Fame. He got to DJ for an hour and some comp food and beverage. We drove in and found the mandatory valet. We parked quickly and luckily they did have a mandatory charge, i didn't have cash on me yet.  We walked in with our DJ and got fancy gold wristbands. They walked us to our daybeds and we took a look around. First I see the captains in the DJ booth. They are ready to rock the boat. Next my brother noticed all the men. LOTS of men. It was early not a biggie. We sat down and started to order bottle service. They brought out the juice first and a bucket of ice and then took a while to bring the actual bottles. The hostess started pouring drinks. This is something I don't like about any club. They pour your first drink. Don't get me wrong, I know it's their job to host but when you have a lot of people some of them like their drinks different ways. Me personally I like a little less ice and more juice, but as a future bartender I understand you fill with ice then prepare. By the time the first round was done so was the bottle, well bring the next! We got into what I would call the VIP pool and continued the day drinking. In the VIP pool they have 2 waterfalls and a glass wall where you can see the rest of the pool. In the main pool you can see the volleyball net and all the balls flying around. After a while my brother grabbed us some drinks from the bar. Keep in mind everything is pricey so 2 fireball and cokes came out to $32.00. Also one blueberry Redbull was like $10. So we stopped ordering at the bar. HA! When my friend went on we all were going in and out of the DJ booth. The captains were giving out shots and every now and again the song would come on. AT THE SAPPHIRE, AT THE SAPPHIRE \"Who said money don't grow on a tree? Don't buy one bottle you should buy about three!\" Yea, every time they took out bottles to a cabana it played.. DJ Jungle Cat also got to give out a bottle to the best twerker, so ratchet and awesome. After this experience I am defiantly willing to go back and party and last but not least PASTIES! That is all.
