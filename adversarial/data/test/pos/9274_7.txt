I travel to Vegas on business monthly, and this being a Hilton property, and to help maintain my diamond status, I thought I would give this hotel a try. \n\nCheck-in was courteous, smooth and quick; the room clean and modern. I'm not a fan of the black\/white\/pink decor, but ok, I can live with it. The bathroom had more amenities than what I am used to...probably the best selection that I have seen in many years. In fact, everything was impressive until I had to do some work with my laptop at the desk. \n\nAnd thus, for me, a 2 star reduction. For starters, the desk is a glass top, with a second top above that is in a permanent askew position to the lower top...why??  Do these designers ever STAY in a hotel? Ok, I can live with working on a desktop that is at an angle, but I can't live with the chair.  \n\nThis chair is so funny and inappropriate, that I called guest services to ask if this was the regular chair?  The rude, yes rude, young gentleman said he had no idea what I was taking about, and transferred me to the front desk where I was told that it was the correct chair and that each tower had its own unique furniture. I was in the World tower and no offer was made to move me to the other tower.  \n\nSo, about this chair...picture the chair used in a kindergarten class but made of hard laminated wood, and not nearly as comfortable for an adult to sit in. After 30 min I had to stop work and lay in the bed as my back started hurting. \n\nI have never experienced this unique design before and will not be a return guest at the SLS...hopefully, I will never see it again.
