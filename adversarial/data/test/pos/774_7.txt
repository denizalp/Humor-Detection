A small place with a charming contemporary design and limited seating, but this has to be one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in the Chandler, AZ area.  We ordered a lot of food and they were wonderful.  I'm giving this place 5 star for a combination of their food and service! Will definitely come back.  They had the best fried gyoza ever (it was the sweet chili sauce that did it for me)!
