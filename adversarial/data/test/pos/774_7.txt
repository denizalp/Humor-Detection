I want to say, before I embark on this journey of writing this review, I am not a gambler, nor will I ever be due to my ill fated luck with the whole ordeal.\n\nAnyway, I do not hold this casino in high esteem. Granted, I have only been there once. Although the casino is extremely spacious, and other people have vouched for the above average quality of the food (I didn't get the chance to eat it), I disliked it.\n\nWhy, you ask? Ladies and gentlemen, it is because of the extremely rude service. When I entered the casino, I was stumbling, because I am a woman, I am tired, and I am wearing three inch heels. After a night of dancing and debauchery, I should be allowed to feel a little bit of exhaustion. If I didn't, then I would have been labeled as a drug abuser.\n\nWhen I showed the bouncer my ID, he made rude inquiries. He asked me why I was stumbling, and I calmly told him I was wearing heels that hurt my feet. He then proceeded to ask me why, and I quipped that I went to a club, and I felt like it. He definitely thought I was a hazard to the safety of the casino.\n\nThe rest of the night was a blur. I had a bad taste in my mouth after he called in some other staff through his radio transmitter. My friends didn't enjoy it, point blank. \n\nMaybe next time, I will be treated better. \n\nIf not, there's always Gila River Casino.
