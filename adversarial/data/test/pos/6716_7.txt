Today I'm sharing some insider information on the best monthly food festival that Vegas has to offer! It's the valley's best kept (not so secret) and you'll reget not coming sooner! \n\nThis popular Thai food fair happens on the last Sunday of every month. They're a non-profit organization selling delicious, cheap and authentic Thai food, dessert, unique produce and snacks prepared fresh on-site. Your purchases are the funds that keep their monastery running. We love supporting this cause! The ladies volunteering the event are on top of their game and very eager to sell you all of their tasty eats. Most of them travel here from Los Angeles, so you know they are dedicated! We come every month without a second thought. Keep in mind they are getting busier and busier as the word spreads, so of course the earlier you arrive, the better. The event starts at 9 AM, but I've seen overzealous fair fans show up at 8 AM. If you wish to dine there, they accommodate you with covered seating under car-ports with fold out tables and chairs, or you can take your goodies to-go.\n\nThe menu changes unpredictably and seasonally, so don't come expecting certain dishes - however, come and enjoy the in-season offerings; we always find something delicious! Make sure you come prepared with cash, it's inexpensive and for under $40 you can leave with a great selection of goodies and even set yourself up with food for the upcoming week! That's what we always do! Our lunch for the week is convenient and delicious. I love it!\n\nThey sell an assortment of Thai and Laotian goodies ranging from $1-$6, but I will mention the ones I've had the pleasure of tasting:\n \n- Mango Sticky Rice $6 (Seasonal) Rated: 5\/5\n\n- Chicken Pad Thai ($5 a box) - there's a long wait for this as it's the most popular dish here. I suggest putting your name down on the waiting list at this station right when you get here to secure your order(s) Rated: 5\/5\n\n- Pork Satay Skewers ($5 for 4 skewers) - Very flavorful! Sweet, salty and tender pork grilled on skewers. I enjoy pairing these with the sweet roti! Sounds weird, but I love the sweet & salty combination! Rated: 5\/5\n\n- Sakoo Sai Moo ($1 for 3) - Chewy tapioca dumplings filled with savory meat & mushroom and topped with fried garlic bits. I love eating these fresh, on-site, since they are delicate and tend to get hard if you try storing them in the fridge. Rated: 5\/5\n\n- Fried Meat Dumplings - Looks like wontons or gyoza, filled with savory meat and then fried into golden brown. Simple and nice, oily snack! Rated: 3\/5\n\n- Fried Shrimp Chips - They look like fried discs made with baby dried shrimp. You can see the eyes, so maybe not for the faint of heart. Rated: 3\/5\n\n- Thai Ice Coffee and Thai Ice Tea ($2 each) - A little watered down and maybe not my favorite version, but it's nice to know it's offered here if you feel the need. Rated: 3\/5\n\n- Sweet Roti with condensed milk and sugar ($1 each) - These are ridiculously tasty! It's unfortunate for the person trying to watch their diet. But hey, it's once a month type of splurge so we always get it! They toast them up right in front of you with country crock butter and then top it with condensed milk and sugar which is then caramelized to golden brown. My only gripe, they are actually store bought roti, but a delicious brand at that! Rated: 5\/5\n\n- Taro & Banana sticky rice - Traditional little wrapped treats in banana leaf. The sticky rice is moist and the filling is tasty! Rated: 4\/5\n\n- Pork and meatball spicy and sour noodle soup\/ you can ask for it non spicy ($5 each) - Another popular item that seems to always be present. It's cooked on site, served piping hot with a soothing broth, and makes a wonderful warming breakfast! Rated: 4\/5\n\n- Thai or Lao style papaya salad ($5 each) -Traditional, with different spice levels and not overpowered with sugar like you typically find at a restaurant. Rated: 3\/5\n\n- Fried doughnuts with condensed milk (Similar to \"Youtiao\" also known as the Chinese cruller and also the Vietnamese version \"Banh Quay\") Rated: 3\/5\n\n- Curry puffs ($5 for 7 small puffs) Taro or Chicken curry with kabocha squash pumpkin curry. These are amazing and very popular! You need to place an order for these a month in advance (Call the monastery to pace you order) Rated: 5\/5\n\n- Veggie eggrolls ($2 for 3) Classic cabbage\/ carrot eggrolls, maybe a little too simple and plain for me. Rated: 2\/5\n\n- Fresh Produce: Okra, Lemongrass, Thai Basil, Kaffir Lime Leaves, Thai-bird chilies & other unique produce. Rated: 5\/5\n\nDon't be overwhelmed and embrace the culture and local flavor this monthly food festival has to offer! Regulars are happy to give you tips if you are lost, also some of the volunteers speak English and of course they are happy to help you. We look forward to it every month and make an effort to not miss it!
