Aldo's team installed the window tint on my S2000 a few years ago.  The Viper antenna wire that was attached to the top of my windshield was mistakenly cut so I was forced to buy a new antenna.  I called Aldo to resolve the issue and he made everything right.  I appreciate the follow up, Aldo.  Better late than never.\n\nThe window tint came out nice.
