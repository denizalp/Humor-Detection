Stitched at first impression is like meeting that perfect guy who claims to be self-made.  Successful businessman who built his company from scratch and single-handedly remembers all the details.  Well, then it turns out that the kid's really a trust-fund baby who has a housekeeper, an assistant, a cook to help him and yet he's still barely holding himself together.\n\nI was impressed with Stitched too when I first laid eyes on the store.  That prime real estate at the Cosmo, those smooth-talking salespeople, the sprinkle of designer labels, and of course, that man cave in the back with the shiny leather couches and the Scotch cabinet.\n\nThe Mr. has been wanting a bespoke suit for a while now and Stitched came close to his heart's desire.  After all, they showed us Ermenegildo Zegna cloth, poured us espresso, and talked fast.  I have a keen eye for shopping and luxury goods but being that this was an experience for the Mr., I asked my OCD self to take a vacation so he can shop in peace.  That was a mistake.\n\nWe purchased a suit, a jacket, and 2 pairs of pants, all together ringing the bill up to almost a hefty chunk of money, the alterations themselves about being 50 times more than I've ever paid.   After missing the first delivery date of the clothes (both of the pants were the wrong length and width as well as the jacket), here we are after barely 3 wears of the clothes and the alterations are coming apart.  It is a worst tailor job that I've ever seen, the hemming haphazardly finished and many shortcuts in sewing taken.  I can pay about 5% as much and take them somewhere else to have a better job.\n\nGo to Stitched if you're buying something that they've bought from another place (like cufflinks or pocket handkerchiefs), if you don't mind paying more and already have your bottle of Scotch parked in their cabinet.  Don't let that designer fabric selection fool you, the in-house construction will be very inferior.  And in the end, what good is luxury bricks if the build of the house is terrible!
