I like this place,  I love sitting in the patio area while it is still less than 100 degrees.  Last time I was there we went for brunch.  I have a delicious Montecristo sandwich, super yummy.  My little boy had the sliders and he kept saying they were the best he has ever had.  I am glad they are opening a location near me, however this one seems to have a certain vibe that is pretty nice.
