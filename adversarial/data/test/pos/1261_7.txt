Chipotle has decent food, but I don't like the lack of choices.\nI just like Baja Fresh better, and if there were one close by, I'd probably not go to Chipotle.\n\nOn one hand, if you're ever at Metro Center and get mugged or assaulted and wonder where are all the police officers, just check Chipotle, as there are usually half a dozen squad cars in the parking lot at any given time.
