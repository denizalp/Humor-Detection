I purchased a car here, I found on the internet, and after reading other reviews, of course the internet sales team is a joke. I got the run around on the car I was calling about. Finally, I got somewhere with it. We went out and looked at the car, like previous reviewers, their prices are WAY jacked. We put down a sizeable amount, spent almost the ENTIRE day there purchasing this car. We were signing papers at 8 pm at night. This process started at about 11 am. crazy. The finance manager just rushed right through the paperwork. One of the papers was a life insurance agreement. I didn't feel it was necessary but the finance manager said the finance company required it, because in case my husband was unemployed, they  would pick up the payments. All of these additional fees,,etc. so after putting down 3 grand, we were back up to list price. However, we still went through with the deal, wish I wouldn't have. We immediately had issues with the car, within one week, the trunk lock was messed up and wouldnt open with either a key fob, or manually. And then the driver window regulator crapped. They did fix both of these issues, but had to dig at me, that it was an expensive fix, they didn't have to do, and then they had to re-tint my driver window. I appreciated that they did that for me, but, I don't expect much less when I own a car for less than one week. my three \"free\" service visits after I bought the car were fine. Service is ridiculous, it shouldn't take 2-3 hours to have an oil change. I quote \"free\" because they made us feel like they were doing something nice for us, and then yet, I see that they are charged into the purchase contract. Free?? Um, not so much. But, then in 2013 my husband was off of work for 4 months due to surgery. Well, in came this disability\/life insurance. Wow, the hoops that we would have to jump through. We found out that the insurance was only on him, even though we are both on the note. And, contrary to what the F&I manager said, it is actually very restrictive on what they pay out. 4 months of payments at 272.04- 1088.16 should have been paid to the lien holder. They only paid 536.00. Now, while this isn't a \"Larry H. Miller\" issue, I would bet my life, my children's lives that Landcar life ins is a Larry H. Miller owned company. Since I used to live in Utah, I am aware of his businesses in the Sandy, Ut & Draper, Ut area, and Landcar is in Utah. Seems to easy. Landcar did not fufill their obligation. So not, only are we disgusted with them, we are disgusted with  LHM Peoria. I have told anyone and everyone my experience, and to be leery of buying a car from them. I know I never will again. I posted something on their facebook page, and got the generic... \"Oh, please call so I can talk to you about your situation.\" I did call. I was told I would receive a call back never happened. Cannot trust LHM dealerships. Poor experience.
