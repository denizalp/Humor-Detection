For what it is it's probably a 4 or 5, but for me it's a solid 3. \n\nMy cousin and I went VegeNation for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived around 1:30 pm and were seated immediately. We both ordered the veggie burger, which we received less than 5 minutes after placing our orders. Had it been a cold dish, it wouldn't have bothered me as much. Was it microwaved?\n\nI am no stranger to veggie burgers, but when the waiter set my plate in front of me I was a bit taken aback. The patty was red! I was also a little confused as to why we only received 4 french fries and a mound a ketchup. After about 3 minutes of mental preparation, i finally took a bite of the burger. It was actually decent. Not nearly as good as my favorite veggie burger from Lucille's, but it was tasty. There was a ton of flavor is the patty, and the burger was dressed with extra goodness. The consistency of the patty was off. I think the ingredient were precooked, chilled and free formed. The texture reminded me of baby food. The fries.. there weren't enough for me to to review, but I will give them an honorable mention.\n\nThe chef came out and asked us home the meal was, which was a lovely touch. The service was excellent. I would probably go back if I was with another Vegan.
