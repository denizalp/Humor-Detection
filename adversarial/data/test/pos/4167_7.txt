In the Hunger Games series District One is supposed to be the holy land riches and beauty. Er... maybe a better comparison would be the first class flight or flying coach, you'll both be getting the same destinations, just certain amenities of first class makes the experience all the better. The cushier seat, the dim lighting, more leg space, and more flight attendant service. District One should probably take a cue from Jet Blue. \n\nThe service here unfortunately gets worse and worse each visit. The first few visits started with longer wait times for food and progressively gotten to one of the worse service experiences I've had in a long time. No one was necessarily \"rude\" but the lack of sense or urgency really killed the experience. Maybe I should of seen it coming when it it took a day and a half to have our waiter take our order, which is usually not a big deal, you're busy I get it. \n\nWe told the server our orders and less than 2 minutes after we tried to cancel the fish tacos (because even with the happy hour pricing the cost\/value was in the negatives).  When we asked the response was \"I just put in your order\". I know, you came to our table right after you placed it, but you're telling me that you can't change the order now because somehow in the past 2 minutes the fish was being cut fresh from the Pacific Ocean and the taco shell was being made fresh (obviously this is an exaggeration because the fish tacos took over 20 minutes to get to our tables, which many would presume is ample time to tell the kitchen to cancel the item). \n\nWhat confuses me the most is that our orders were repeated to us by the server, yet 1 order of pho tai nam and an order of steak and eggs were missing? Maybe the kitchen is having a delay, no problem, but ten minutes later we followed up with it and the steak and eggs came out within minutes, perfect (except for the fact the rice should of been in a cereal box considering how crunchy it was) and then another 10 minutes later (a total of 40 mins waiting for our food) for a pho tai nam (came out minutes later as well). \n\nThe check was another hassle of its own, and in short, the party of 4 split the check 2 ways (which we wrote in pen) and it was still messed up. It took two reprints to fix things. Water refills? Wishful thinking.\n\nSo Kevin T, you obviously had terrible service, why the 2 stars? Fortunately and unfortunately D1 has the best pho (noodles cooked inconsistently though) and food for the majority ranges from acceptable to great. Sometimes theres lots of love in the food and sometimes... none.\n\nThings to order:\n\nPho (any except lobster)\nMekong River Noodle Soup\nBeef Carpaccio \nWings\nBeef (from their fairly crafty craft beer list)\n\nThings to pass:\nBelly buns\nLobster pho (really? #onlyinvegas)\nExpectations of great service\nFish tacos (I have dog treats bigger than these)\n\nWill I come back? Maybe someday when the raging hole in my heart after getting burned so hard by the service heals.
