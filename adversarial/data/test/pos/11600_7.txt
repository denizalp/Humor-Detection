This was our first time at CherryBlossom. Hubby has needed to eat more vegetarian lately, so I've been on the lookout for new places with more options. \n\nThe food was mostly great. Hubby enjoyed his tofu yakisoba, I liked my chicken katsu (although a couple of pieces were not quite done), loved my salad, liked the bread basket, and we both really enjoyed the crispy California roll. Dessert was also pretty good- we liked my flan better than his green tea mousse (which was not very sweet except for the almond flavored cream on top). \n\nService was attentive in the beginning and then our waiter disappeared. I witnessed two other tables in our section grow confused and then annoyed as we waited... and waited... and waited for the waiter to return. One couple was even in mid-payment and finally went to the take out counter to inquire what was happening. I asked the busser to let the waited know we wanted our check. This disappearing act really took the shine off of an otherwise nice dinner. We'll likely return, however, to give CherryBlossom another chance.
