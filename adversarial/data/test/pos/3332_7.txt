DO NOT BUY THEIR VACATION BACK DEALS!!- ultimately you'll be in for a scam, sitting through silly presentation where they try to charge your credit card in order to get your promised refund!\n\nAnd yes quite dusty and didn't get our room serviced the first night\/day stay. We got two more nights here. Second  time at the Luxor due to this darn deal. Edit** We got full refund, but paid fees. Our first stay in the suite was better. All else, not worth it for us. I rather book w newer, more modern hotels :)
