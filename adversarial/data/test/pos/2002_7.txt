I always go for neighbouring Banjara, but tonight I decided to give Madras Masala a go. Sure it's smaller, and its Southern Indian cuisine is less familiar to this very, very white woman, but they have a killer patio. Their menu is also slightly cheaper, and when you're ordering family style each dish can really add up. \n\nI blindly ordered a few things off the menu, and the nice server said they could do a mutter paneer even they don't normally offer it. This mutter was one of the best paneer dishes I've ever had, probably because they only made one order and really took care in its making. I'm sure they will be annoyed when I start coming by on the regular and habitually ordering things that aren't on the menu, but they will deal. It was creamy perfection.\n\nPEPPER POINTS for the small patio overlooking Chritie Pits. Definitely the tops, not the pits.
