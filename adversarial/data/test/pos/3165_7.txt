Two months ago I would have given Merchant two stars. The menu read like a United Colors of Benetton billboard crammed with Thai, Mexican, Indian and good ole fashioned American. There was a note about chefs shopping the farmer's market for what was in season which apparently meant more flavors from across the globe than MJ's Heal the World video. A cornucopia of flavors that was really hard to read and make sense of. Bartenders were green and pulled out little black books to remember cocktails they themselves created. It was a mess.\n\nBUT, I'm happy to report the times they are a changing! Merchant was AB FAB tonight, so much so that I was crafting a review in my head while I was eating (rare that I mix work with pleasure). \n\nGet the mussels. TOMORROW. They're in a creamier broth than I typically prefer but tasty nonetheless. Served with a garlic rubbed bread it's a perfect way to start your evening, especially if you plan to share some stuff with friends and need a little nosh early on. I also recommend you get the patatas bravas, a more American take on a classic Spanish tapas, but flavorful for a potato. Hangar steak tonight was a little overcooked for my tastes, but it had great char and a nice flavor, albeit a little less pink than I prefer. We subbed the taters out for frites and couldn't believe how long they stayed warm in the middle. I hate... HAAAATE cold frites, even luke warm frites, so whatever these guys are doing to 'em rawks, they're magic frites. Super awesome. \n\nAny place that freshly squeezes their juice ranks high in my book, and these guys are doing it with grapefruits, even though it's 2 bucks a pop at the store right now. (Makes me think they won't cut corners when prices rise). \n\nBar area was slammed so service was a little slower, but I didn't have anywhere to go so it didn't matter. Know that when they have music there are usually killer tap specials, so the place will fill up. Grab seats early like we did and don't be afraid to get all up in someone's face. I did at one point and at the end of the night the bartender helping us out said thanks for being patient and flagging him down when we wanted. \n\nAll in all, this place is miles better than when I was there over the summer. If you haven't been recently give them another try, and as soon as I get back there and try more of their concise and easier to read menu, I'll let you know how it goes!
