It pains me to write this review but sigh, here goes.  Everyone knows I am a HUGE supporter of local, independently-owned businesses.  When I read Courtney Bonning's story of how she started Bon Bon and after tasting many of her cupcakes at Phoenix Coffee on W. 9th, I decided it was time to stop into her bake shop.  I first visited the web site to confirm there is, in fact, a retail business and not just wholesale to Cleveland businesses.  The web site says retail.  Cool.  So, I find the little bake shop and walk in.  I literally walked into an operating bakery.  She greeted me with, \"Hello.  Have you been here before?\"  I said, \"No.\"  She proceeded to turn around and grab a business card, hand it to me, and tell me to check out their web site.  She rattled off the fact they do cakes, cupcakes, etc.  and then she RUDELY turned her back on me and walked away.  EXCUSE ME?  How the hell did she know I didn't want to place an order right then and there for 500 cupcakes or a wedding cake?  I was instantly turned off by Ms. Bonning's attitude.  THIS JUST IN MS. BONNING:  If you are trying to run the business and do all the baking, why try and say you have a retail business, especially if you have no customer service skills?   Stick to wholesale if you can't be polite or handle it.
