Since Yu-Yu's has opened I have become a regular customer, once a week and have brought several friends, many from Japan, who can be quite picky about their Japanese food.  They in turn have come back and brought their friends.  I enjoy the simple fare, such as their oyako donburi which is extremely well prepared, the best.  They serve it with a home made soup called butajiro which is excellent!  In addition the owner is a top-ranked go player.
