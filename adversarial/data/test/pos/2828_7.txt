I live and work close by so this is my go to spot for a quick and yummy take out lunch. I always take out have never actually sat and dined in. \n\nThey have daily specials, I usually get the teriyaki chicken, a roll and salad lunch special combo. \n\nQuick and great every time. \n\nThe food is fresh and leaves me full without that heavy feeling! \n\nPortions and price are good!
