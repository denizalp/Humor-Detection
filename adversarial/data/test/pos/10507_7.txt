Dr. Chuang has something in common with the current San Francisco 49er quarterback, Collin Kapernick.   She got the job as my family doctor, when the other doctor in her office was out on leave.    \n\nEight years ago, I stepped in to see her partner for a cough that never stopped, but I guess it was destiny that the office receptionist made the switch happened that day.\n\nFrom what I noticed on my first visit, Dr. Chuang took her time with my questions, and she was blessed with great bedside manner.    After that visit, I was wondering if I had the right doctor at that time?    Perhaps, I should make switch like what Jim Harbaugh did when Alex Smith went down, or just stay with the starter who was out for a few weeks?    Needless to say, another incident happen a few weeks later, and my doctor was still out.   \n\nThe starter was taken out, and the rest is history.    Since then Dr Chuang moved her practice from the Seven hills location to her current location on Horizon Ridge, and I been with her ever since.\n\nDoctor Chuang's practice has grown in the past few years, and her office is pretty busy most of the time, but it's seems I can still get an appointment pretty quickly, and very often the office staff can fit me in the schedule that day.    I guess being one of her longest running patients has it's advantage or maybe I just have a great timing.
