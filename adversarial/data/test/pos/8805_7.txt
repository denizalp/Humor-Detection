Where the casino undead go to die.\n\nIf Walmart ran a casino Sams Town would be it.\nThe ugliest, scariest, most disturbing, in-pain people and employees you'll ever see.\nCrummy payouts on the machines.\n\nBartenders creepy. All of them.\n\nThe food sux. All of it.\n\nNo beautiful women, no handsome hunks.\nJust all Walmart drones.\n\nRude employees in the RV park check in.\nNasty and indifferent attitude.\n\nWiFi extra cost and requires you to SIGN UP WITH THE LOCAL COX CABLE COMPANY. Word is Sams Town is blocking guests internet and phone service so you'll pay for theirs. Our Verizon signal suddenly dies when on Sams Town property so maybe something to that.\n\nClean premises but no deals here.\nYa don't get what you pay for.\n\nCome on in and and play with those old blue hair folks waiting for their turn to die.\nIt isn't where locals go to game.
