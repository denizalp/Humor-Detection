I lost $5 to a slot machine. It was also very disappointing to be so close to the Vegas strip and not be able to go find some delicious food. \n\nShort layover (or at least, was supposed to be short, but my Southwest flight was delayed) meant not much time to explore. I ate a Nathan's hot dog, lost some money gambling, and that's about it.\n\nIt's a little out-dated, but still, having the slot machines in the terminal is fun, even if I don't win anything on them.
