My first experience of Yerba Mate with my dear friend was sentimental and pleasant! \n\nDrinking mate \"is a symbol of hospitality. As the mate gourd is passed around, a sense of connection emerges.\" I just love the idea how it is shared with friends and like a little ritual and has certain type of symbolism. \n\nAside from that Mate (\"the drink of God\" ) does have a lot of health benefits and loads with Antioxidants. \n\nThe taste remind me of the turtle herbal jello I usually eat in Chinese dessert place. Bitter but with a sweet undertone.. even without sweetener. However, mate definitely tastes a lot grassier... a taste that have to get use of. \n\nThe barista here was super nice, showing us how to perform the \"Mate Gourd Ceremony\". The services was a little slow though, since she was the only one working there! \n\nI will definitely be back to El Almacen Yerba Mate Cafe to chill out with my friends!!
