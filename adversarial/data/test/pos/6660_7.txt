The Teeter House itself is very cool. Nobuo has a very nice interior\/decor, it's a very calm, relaxed, even romantic environment.\n\nI love Japanese food. Have been to Japan and eaten a wide variety of Japanese food. The food at Nobuo was good, but it is very posh, very pretentious, very small portions, very expensive. This is essentially Japanese Tapas, lots of small dishes. Very small dishes.\n\nI gave 3 stars because I actually didn't feel like the food was that amazing, and considering the price, I felt the value was poor. The staff was great though.\n\nBut, if you are pretentious or want to impress someone who is, this is the place for you.
