(Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" begins to play)\n\n\"Party people...Party people...Can y'all get funky?\"\n\n(I take a heaping forkful of Kimchi Fries)\n\n\"Soul Sonic Force, can y'll get funky?\"\n\n(I stand up, clear space.)\n\n\"The Zulu Nation, can y'll get funky?\"\n\n(Take a bite of Kalbi Banh Mi)\n\n\"Yaaaaaa...Just hit me.\"\n\n[Uprock into Air Flare into Windmill...Halo, Halo, Headspin...Freeze.]\n\nI open my eyes.\n\nAs a kid, I always dreamed of being a REAL breakdancer. A breaker. A b-boy. I wanted to go by the name Chris \"Crazy Legs\" L. I practiced every day in my driveway on a sheet of linoleum and showcased my moves at school dances. Although I was never able to do a real \"power move,\" my aspiring b-boy years were one of the highlights of my nightmare of an adolescence. So, when Planet Rock came on yesterday at BMB, I was immediately transported to a different time and place, only this time, I had a pile of delicious Viet-Mexican fusion food in front of me.\n\nSince my initial visit last winter, Banh Mi Boys has become one of my must-gos whenever I come to Toronto. I've been to many of Toronto's great restaurants, but this is the only one I would be truly sad about not visiting while here.\n\nEveryone knows that the food here is awesome. The kimchi fries, kalbi everything, pork belly buns...all amazing. The drinks are diverse. The seating is endearingly limited. \n\nBut it's the atmosphere that makes this place special. Sitting here eating this food, listening to this music with my hot Asian fianc√©e represents the life is always dreamed of as a child. \n\nThats why I will always come back for more.
