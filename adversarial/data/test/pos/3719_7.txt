If your ever in the mood to get down and don't want to have to settle for one entree, this is def the spot.  Family style menu where you can't go wrong with anything!\n\nShishito peppers: flash fried and topped with an earthy salt seasoning.  Ask for a side of lemon and give it a squeeze on top. Muah, perfect.\n\nSpicy cucumbers: tossed in a spicy seasoning with smashed avocado.  Super crunchy, especially with Spanish almonds that top it\n\nHeart of palm salad: tomato, snap peas, avocado,watercress, and a dressing blessed from above.  If we didn't already order so much food, I would have asked for another. \n\nWhole Jidori chicken: seasoned with lime and curry. Wow, what a combination and the chicken is moist and juicy. Comes with kimchi and a side of rice. Ask for soy sauce and shiracha on the side, boom, fantastico.\n\nThey have dessert from the milkshake bar next door.  We were stuffed, so didn't venture there.\n\nDon't be fooled by the casual bar area that you see when you walk up.  There is an entire area behind that is a bit nicer.
