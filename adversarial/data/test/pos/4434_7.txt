Definitely an interesting museum to check out whether you're from the area or just visiting (like myself).  I've read some reviews prior to coming here and some say that the images were quite graphic.  Some of the pictures were graphic but it's nothing new if you've been watching documentaries that are gruesome so you'll be fine.\n\nStarting off on the third floor are images of different mobs and a room where you can watch a short documentary.  There's even a chance for a photo op of you in police lineup and you really can't see on the what's on the other side which mimics a real lineup (I promise I wouldn't know what it's like in real life lol).  Anyway, there were tons of artifacts and information where you can look and read.\n\nWhen you get to the second floor, you wait in a room that allows you to enter a courtroom.  Initially, I thought it was going to be some sort of interactive show but it definitely wasn't that.  Instead, it was just another documentary that you get to watch and some actor portrayal in a film.  Other than that, there was more you get to see as you walk along from notes\/letters from jail, to more images of graphic scenes to outfits of certain mobsters.  \n\nWhat I remember of the first floor (other than their gift shop) was reading what had happened to those who were involved in the mob scene back then -- if they had disappeared, etc.  Again, there were tons of info that I found pretty interesting.\n\nThere's a parking lot right next to the museum for $5 but I had also seen a parking structure across the street that was apparently free, too.  \n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool museum and I'm glad we got to go.
