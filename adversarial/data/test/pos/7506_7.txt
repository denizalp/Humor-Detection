I seriously loved my first Bad Daddy's experience. We went on Sunday night of 4th of July weekend and got seated after a 5ish minute wait. I imagine the wait gets pretty long on a weekend night. They have a text system so you don't have to wait in the vicinity if you have a long wait.\n\nTheir waiters are chipper and help you through the menu. I got the one and only veggie burger as is and it was delicious. It came with some chipotle sauce that was one of the best I've ever had. I made my own side salad which was forgettable, but the sweet potato fries were the best I've had in Charlotte so far. Perfect crispiness. The veggie burger itself was hearty and flavorful. Next time we'll definitely stick around for the boozy milkshakes. Can't wait to go back!
