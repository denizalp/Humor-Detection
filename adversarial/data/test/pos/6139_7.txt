Not even going to explain how I ended up here, so let's just skip forward a bit and wrap this up quickly...\n\nI've been to nicer joints in TJ, and if my brother wasn't 6'5\" and 280lbs, I don't know that I wouldn't have gotten mugged in the back alley.\n\nI think they should reconsider naming this place Chicas Gorditas.  It was not pretty.  Thank goodness for mas Tecates!  Even though the bartender forgot to change my $20 when we ordered 2 beers.  I didn't feel it would have been beneficial to our well being to pursue the matter though.  I'm a good tipper!  \n\nChalking this one up to life experience...
