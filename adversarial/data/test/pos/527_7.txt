This place was hit and miss for me. The thing I liked I truly enjoyed and the things I didn't quite like are still haunting me.\n\nTheir California Turkey sandwich is to die for! Tasty and colorful and light it's the perfect balance and tasty to the last bite! \n\nThe down side was the fruity pebbles cookie. How deceived I was by the pictures and description online! Even in person it looked beautiful until I took a bite and almost lost every tooth in my mouth. Hard. As. Rock. Eat at your own risk!\n\nI will definitely keep ordering for lunch but I will definitely stay away from dessert!
