I, too, had an issue yesterday with the store refusing to honor the outlet store Savings Passport coupon which promises $15 off any (and I stress ANY) $50 purchase. There is absolutely nothing in the store saying that they refuse to honor coupons, but the sales clerk said I could not use it. I was very annoyed and voiced my displeasure at checkout, and the manager came over and begrudgingly agreed to give me $10 off. I'm happy about that, but irritated that others have had the same \"no coupons\" experience. \n\nThe store had a great 75% off sale but you have to remember that these are grossly overpriced bath products in the first place. It's nice to get fancy looking and rich smelling soaps, lotions, and more. This is a good place to pick up pretty little items to add to a gift basket too. \n\nThe store is neat and tidy, providing a nicely organized way to shop. The aisles are wide enough and most products are available to sample for free.\n\nI'd bump this place up to a 4 or 5 star rating if the staff was better.
