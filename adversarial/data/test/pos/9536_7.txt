For a resort in the middle of the desert this one makes you feel right at home.  It really is a large resort that sprawls over a large area.  On the grounds there is a day spa, restaurant, courtyard areas, pool, and a bar.  I did not stay there overnight, just went to meet my brother, who was visiting.  We had some food in restaurant and had a couple drinks.  We even wondered to this little town in the back of the property that looked like a ghost town.  Most likely used for holding company events and things like this.
