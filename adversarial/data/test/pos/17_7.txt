Feast for the eyes, this old bank building is a cornucopia of mixed materials from glass to wood to concrete to steel to block to brick and astroturf. Dining a mixed bag, but you're sure to SEE something you like. [blink]\n\n--best seat in thehouse is the corner by the fire\n--bacchi (sp?) Ball court just like home vig location\n--hip urban feel which is difficult to find downtown.\n\n--great service, attentive and super friendly.\n--she even caught the bartender (it was hard to miss) shaking the shit out of my martini, stopped him and made him start over.\n\n--rib eye fatty, not trimmed, and in pieces. Horrible cut.\n--spinach puree very interesting, but doesn't work as presented. (Wants to surround the dish, not be shuffled off on the side)\n--so too go the potatoes. Gratin slightly burned and wants to be as elegant as the architectural lines of the building. Redesign this plate!\n--burger, although ordered medium, arrived charred but RAW!!\n--onion rings nothing to write home about.\n--banana bread pudding rich enough to serve 4. split it, or\n--hot fudge sundae. NICE!\n\nnot many places in town which are Hipster, Trendy, Romantic, Casual AND Classy. Nice hang out.
