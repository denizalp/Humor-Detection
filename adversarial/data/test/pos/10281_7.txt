Im so sad to have to write this because all I have ever known is Nissan dealers. Previously moving to AZ, I resided in Iowa - so all my experience has been with Nissan dealerships in Iowa. \n\nHere goes: When I purchased my car last March, it didn't go smooth whatsoever.  The finance team was disrespectful of my time and was very rude to my boyfriend. And just about everything else that could of gone wrong.... did. I ended up filing a claim to the general manager. In the end, I was promised a two-year maintenance package, which included oil changes.\n\nSince my car purchase I have received a few oil changes, no issues. Here I am now and the guy is telling me that I don't have a maintenance plan. \n\nThe chance that I will ever purchase a car from Pinnacle Nissan again or refer anyone for that matter is 0%.\n\nOne star ONLY because the  shuttle driver is uber nice!!!!
