12\/31\/15 & 1\/1\/16 I love shopping at DSW. \n\nI'm the type that does not expect too much customer service and prefers to be left alone.  I do expect the workers to know their job. \n\nI originally was going to give an average three star rating because; the store was clean and organized, clearance rack was neat w\/good selection of shoes,  store had many associates on the floor.  No stars for customer service because no initial greeting,  no asking if I needed assistance. \n\nFor this visit, in the clearance section I found an UGG boot but it was snug.  \n\n1st associate-I asked if he could check inventory for bigger size... He told me to go check the clearance rack for bigger size.   I did but no luck, so I also began checking the floor. \n\n2nd associate in boot area,  I asked if there were any on the floor.  She gave me 3 reasons,  why this boot would only be in the clearance section.   One reason,  was this was a return that was purchased at another store and they do not carry this style.  I thought this girl knows her inventory.   Anyway,  I found the boot on the sales floor and got the size I needed.   Sigh...\n\n3rd associate-I'm paying for the boot and asked the associate if the 3X point promotion expired.   She gave me a questioning look so I decided to look for the email on my phone.   Takes me a minute to look and I see it had expired.  So as I tell her it expired she tells me, \"Oh,  yeah that expired a couple of days ago.\"   Sigh... \n\nSo I purchase the boots.   I decided to wear the boots the next day and I'm setting off security sensors at other stores,  I finally figured out it was because the security sensor from the boots was not removed.  We drive back to DSW, and I go directly to the cash register.   The cashier,  3rd associate,  recognizes me and the boots and immediately removes the sensor.   Then she makez the comment,  how come the alarm didn't go off when I entered the store with the boots.  \n\nAnyway, I minused 2 stars because the 3 associates wasted my time.
