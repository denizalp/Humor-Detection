This really is a cool place, but since I wanted to go for the yuks (yes, you must click Funny), I decided to make all my comments review style:\n\n\n\"Way cool lighting -- too bad you can't see anyone. They must be ghosts.\"\n\n\"What do you mean she can't sit on my lap? Club rules? Those people are practically having sex over there!\"\n\n\"That was cool -- no cover.\"\n\n\"Plastic cups?\"\n\n\"Damn, that's a strong martini.\"\n\n\"Wow, look at that view. You can almost see to California.\"\n\n\"She really should be wearing more clothes -- 200 lbs. doesn't look good in a halter top.\"
