Johnny Fontanes is the best spot in town to watch NY Giants football on gameday! This is one of my usual hangouts when I want to have a chill night and drink till the wee-hours of the morning, but during football season Fontanes turns into NY Giants mecca for fans here in town.\nWith good food, friendly bartenders (especially Mario, Missy and Kimmy) and a bunch of rowdy Giants fans cheering on the boys in Blue.\nLast night they also had a girl doing spray on tattoos of various Giants logos and Fox 5 News even dropped in (can see the clips online).\nMy favorite items on the menu:\nLarge Pizza with Meatballs (a must on gameday)\nStromboli\nWings\n\nYou can find me here during every Giants game and usually on weekends late night from 12am on.\n\nOther fans are welcome, but make sure you can take some smack talk! Nothing personal :)
