Aces and Ales is an upscale bar with an impressive list of craft brews on tap. The menu is extensive and features unique dining options (beer candied bacon, anyone?) in addition to the usual bar food (nachos and pizza). It has never smelled like cigarette smoke inside, and I only eat on the bar side of the pub. I came here with a Groupon for $15 for $30. \n\nBEER BITES ($6.50): I've ordered these in the past, but this time the beer bites were pretty lackluster. They were all parmesan and no garlic, all bark and no bite. The bites come with a trio of sauces: beer cheese, marinara sauce, and queso dip. They seemed to be nuked. The beer cheese didn't taste like anything at all. Probably won't order these again. 2\/5    \n\nCAJUN MAC & CHEESE ($11.50): Minus the sausage and onions of course. I always get this when I come here because it's so delicious. Again, it did not compare to previous visits. It had a powerful greasy taste to it and lacked the usual spicy kick. No bueno. I'll try something different the next time I come here. 2\/5 \n\nFISH TACOS ($13): My guy had to pull out the jalapenos because they were so spicy! He couldn't handle the heat lol. Overall, he said this dish was just okay. 3\/5\n\nTHE COOKIE THING ($6): Hated it. Took one bite and said no way. The description made it sound like a wonderful chocolate chip cookie. Instead it looked and tasted like a burnt brownie. 1\/5\n\nDEEP FRIED OREOS ($6): Of course it was delicious. They're fried oreos! It's a huge portion of fatty goodness. Hmmmm. I swapped the cookie thing out for the oreos. 4.5\/5   \n\nSERVICE: It's seat yourself. Also, make sure you have at least an hour and a half to spare if you choose to dine at Aces and Ales, because service is aggravatingly slow. If you can get past the slow turn out times of the kitchen staff and the slow service received by servers, Aces and Ales is a great local bar to hang out at. 2\/5 \n\nVIBE: I love the vibe at Aces and Ales. There's a mix of young and old here. On my most recent visit, my husband and I were over the moon about the playlist. Aces and Ales was actually playing good music! Slipknot, Faith No More, and Slayer were our favorite bands that graced the playlist. Apparently the bartender was in charge of the music set, and we made sure to thank him for the great music before we left. 4\/5  \n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nSo this particular visit was a flop with the food, but my husband and I remain fans! Make sure you come with a Groupon (there's a $15 for $30 deal for dinner), because food can get expensive real quick. I'd recommend checking out this bar if you're big on craft beer and are looking for bar with a twist to the usual bar grub.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #175
