Pratt's would be great if you are not really in need of anything specific. {Perfect place to kill time with your 5 year old niece.  They have lots of birds and bird products but not everything . If you are in the market for a peacock , pigeon or parrot you are in the right place. They have the whole baby chick industry all figured out with more chicks than Hef has. \n They also have a few exotic pets such as  tortoise , snake, and a pig or two.  But if you really needed a lot of pet supplies this is not your place and they aren't as inexpensive as say the Stock shop or Petco.  Service is a bit \nsad , the clerks seemed frazzled or bored I couldn't  decide.  We also were told by the clerk to go buy or other pet needs at Petsmart because it would be cheaper. Hmm.
