Came here years ago, but remember my \"experience\" vividly. It's without exception the worst buffet I've been to: everything was either dry, soggy, broken down, powdery, or a combination of these. And worst of all, we had to wait in lines for something that seemed straight out of the frozen foods section of a Walmart.\n\nPrices seemed to have gone up significantly since I was here. Why would anyone in their right mind spend more than $15 to eat here, let alone $5, when there are so many better (and even cheaper) dining options in Vegas?
