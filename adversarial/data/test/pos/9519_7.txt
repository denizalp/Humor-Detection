Reservations highly recommended, but if you want to sit outside you'll have to put yourself on the wait list no matter what. Since it was wintertime when I dined here I didn't mind sitting indoors. We were seated in the sun room section of the restaurant, so we were able to enjoy a view without freezing our heinies off outside.\n\nFor the most part I really enjoyed my meal here. Although the chicken liver mousse tasted just like regular liverwurst you can buy at the grocery store (I've had much better), it was still decent. I loved my bacon kale salad and would definitely order it again. My husband tried the chicken and brie sandwich and neither of us really liked it that much. The french bread they serve is SO good. It's warm and fresh when they bring it to your table too. However, I would prefer they pre-slice the bread beforehand. We requested that it be sliced and when they brought it back to us the slices of bread were all smashed! Another word of advice: invest in a decent bread knife for customers who want their bread sliced.\n\nService was great. Our waitress was super sweet and pleasant and very attentive.
