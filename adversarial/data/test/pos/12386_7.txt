We were on our way to am early afternoon screening at Bloor Cinema and wanted to grab a bite to eat beforehand.  We stumbled upon BTW and decided to try it since we had both never been.\n\nWe were seated right away, served beverages almost right away.  We ordered our food also relatively quickly.  No complaints about slow service at all.\n\nWe were sipping our juices and coffees and I noticed a group of three walk in.  The guy beside us had just left (freeing up a table for 2), and there was only another table for 2 available.  I decided to interfere with things and offered to move to the other table for 2 so that the group that just walked in would be able to sit together.  We hadn't gotten our food yet, so it was an easy move.\n\nMy freshly squeezed grapefruit juice was delicious and refreshing.  I ordered the craziest thing I could find on the menu - a French toast sandwich!  Basically, they stick sliced apples (cooked with cinnamon) and slices of brie cheese between two pieces of French toast.  They give you syrup in a small dipping dish and plenty of fresh fruit.  It was just heavy enough, yet not gross.  Admittedly, I was starving - but I scarfed down my meal pretty quickly.  Delicious!\n\nMy date enjoyed one of their exotic soups - large portion, and seemed to be quite thick.  I never paid attention to what he ordered for his main... but I don't think there were any complaints.  I was too busy devouring my meal.\n\nI was impressed that they weren't mixed up after we moved to a different table, since we ordered at one, and received our food at another.  Then, they did something that won me over - when they brought our bill (again, this part of the process did not take long) they told us they discounted everything by 15% because we were so kind to change tables to accommodate the other diners!\n\nIt truly wasn't a big deal for us to change tables, since our food had not yet arrived.  I hate stuffing my face in front of the starving people in line, so it just seemed like a sensible move to me.  I'm glad BTW was so grateful and appreciated our gesture.  It's not often that you get surprise discounts like that!\n\nGreat food, great service.  Will be back!
