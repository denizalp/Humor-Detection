A MUST SEE for foodies.  \n\nThere are two Jean Phillippe Patisseries.  One in the Bellagio and this one in the back of the Aria.  You'll know you're close to it when you run into hoards of tourists bumping into each other because they are walking around with their cameras in front of them.   \n\nImagine what would happen if Disneyland imagineers decided to get  into the baking business...this would be the result.  Amazing fondant enrobed cakes in brilliant colors twirling around on tall sparkling chrome vines.  Brightly lit display cases filled with row after row of (fill in a superlative here) desserts.  \n\nFirst off this patisserie is an assault on the eyes.  Eye popping cake displays of Alice In Wonderland colors and movement.  If you eat with your eyes you'll be full before you get within four feet of the counter.  Once there you will be dazzled with art gallery-like pastries and chocolate desserts.  \n\nDiabetics must curse Jean Philippe as they load up their syringes for a suicide mission to the dessert counter.  I am a type II diabetic, but damned if I was going to be denied.  I choose a round chocolate morsel that resembled a chocolate dipped apple.  Even though it was only the size of a plum it satisfied the appetite of three people.  Devastatingly rich chocolate layers of mousse, caramel, ganache and nuts with I'm sure a good dose of butter and egg yolks folded inside.  So worth it for $7.  Actually, it was very cheap for what I got.\n\nI will be back!
