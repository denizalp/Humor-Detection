I think I ate some of the freshest fish I have ever had in my life at Yonaka! I'm slightly worried it might ruin me for other sushi (like, um, our usual semi-weekly AYCE gorgefest).\n\nI had the single best piece of salmon belly I have ever eaten! It literally, literally melted in my mouth. The toro was fantastic as well. Each piece of sushi is served with its own special flavorful accompaniment and the fish is so fresh and tasty by itself that you will not long for soy sauce and wasabi. We had very simple shrimp nigiri which was topped with a little dab of garlic butter which added awesome flavor. It was like Shrimp DeJonghe nigiri. YUM.\n\nThe only disappointment for me was the wagyu nigiri, which my husband wanted to try- it was just kind of boring. HowEVER we also had a dish called niku berry which had perfectly cooked beef, mushrooms, strawberries, a fried egg pur√©e and an amaaaazing chimichurri, so don't stay away from the meat!\n\nI could happily make a meal of their sushi but the tapas portion of the menu is too yummy to ignore. I looooved the sake orenji which is so refreshing and explodes with fresh deliciousness.  Our first dish was a special which was some crazy concoction of tuna with dehydrated pineapple, blue cheese, apple and fennel.The crudo (which we were lucky enough to receive free of charge) was great, too. Honestly, everything was great! Chef Ramir is pretty awesome. I really want to come back for omakase or something because I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nOH and get the chokoreto appetizer which is a crazy array of flavors (chocolate, mint, lime, avocado) and textures (crispy, crunchy, creamy, crumbly).\n\nWhat I really like about Yonaka is that it feels like a really cool, classy restaurant on the Strip but instead it is a really cool, classy restaurant free of annoying Strip pretension and without Strip prices. Our bill was surprisingly reasonable.\n\nStaff are super nice and helpful and made us feel very appreciated! When asked where we heard about the place, we mentioned Yelp and they gushed a little about Misti Y. and the great review she left (which is what made me take notice of Yonaka in the first place, so thanks, Misti!).
