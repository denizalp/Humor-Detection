I AINT NO UPPER CLASS. I don't go out and spend $100 on dinner everyday. With that said.. I don't appreciate my waiter giving me attitude just because I don't know half of his fancy schmancy expensive food vocabulary.\n\nWe got there last Friday at around 730 PM. The waiter went over the menu with us and began taking order. We didn't know what kind of cooking style we want on the fish. When we asked him questions, instead of him answering patiently, he decided to just give us THE LOOK and say \"i just went over all the cooking style with you..\"BLAH..\n\nThe food was salty and whatever.. \n\nI don't understand why he's giving me attitude if I still have to pay him tip.\n\nI'm gonna save that money for a nice purse next time.
