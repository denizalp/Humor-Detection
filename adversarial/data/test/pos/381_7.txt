News does not count.\nAlso, why do they call them 24 hour fitness when you can't access it 24 hours a day? More like 18 hour fitness. \nHonestly, planet fitness is down the street and it's half the cost for a month to month membership. I'm switching. Which this gym was like the Cali ones I'm used to. *sigh*\nThe equipment is mediocre, but I like that the water fountain water is cold. \nAnd I like.....\nNope, that about covers it.
