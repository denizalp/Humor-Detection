We held a banquet in December 2012 on a Saturday for a party of about 30 people, give or take at the actual Heidi's location. Heidi worked with our budget and was extremely responsive in the beginning which we were extremely grateful for. We had a 3 course meal consisting of salad, beef bourguignon, and an assortment of desserts. Nothing tasted weird or anything when were eating it at Heidi's and the guests thought the food was good. The party went well, awards were given out, and all of us were happy that another successful formal banquet had been planned and passed without any hardship.\n\n*Cue Horror Music* \n\nCome  the following Sunday and Monday, all of my friends are falling sick left and right, dropping like flies. One even passed out on the bathroom floor at 3 am and had to be sent to the ER. All of them were complaining of the same symptoms: throwing up, fevers, stomach-aches, tiredness, etc. I didn't know what was going on until we all realized that over 3\/4 of the guests present at the formal banquet was sick. \n\nOur social chair contacted Heidi's and their very first response was \"we're sorry to hear that YOUR party has fallen ill\" but it wasn't their fault because their cooks ate the same meal as us that night and they were not sick. \n\nFirst of all, this wasn't just \"our party\" because Heidi's hosted it and fed us so they neglected to accept any responsibility at all. Secondly, while your employees may be well, it should be the customer's well-being that you are concerned about instead of just waving it off like no big deal.It's as if a guest walked over a certain part of the floor and slipped and hurt herself, but the chef had walked over the same part and was fine so it's no problem. Thirdly, Heidi's tried to point out that their staff eavesdropped on our guests planning to go somewhere afterwords so we must have contracted it at the location they went after. While what they heard was true, this lame excuse was proven false as most of our guests actually went straight home right after, including those who were most sick afterwords. \n\nAfter I was made social chair in January, I tried to pick up after our last Social chair who e-mailed Heidi's for a solution but after back and forth statements that none of it was their fault, they stopped e-mailing and left it at them still trying to side-step away from getting almost an entire party ill. \n\nWhile I understand that many others below have had great experiences with Heidi's, I only wish our guests could have received the same as well. I'm not entirely suggesting that you not contact their catering as an option for your next event because it seems like we were the first case, but I'm definitely not going to advocate for it either. \n\nP.S. Might I add that our entire party was made up of college students. Particularly, college students who have iron stomachs; stomachs that have digested food & beverage combinations unseen or unheard of. It's hard to get us sick. Just saying.
