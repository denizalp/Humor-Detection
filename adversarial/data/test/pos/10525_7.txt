I wanted to love this place.  Everyone else loves this place.  But I don't.\n\nI must be an oddball.\n\nAnyway, I actually like the atmosphere here.  I like that it's dark and kind of divey with plenty of seats either at the bar or at the tables.  I like the super friendly servers.\n\nI've visited a couple times and although the menu rotates, it seems to be heavy on (very) dark beers.  It's the summer and it's hella hot outside- can I get something a little lighter?  Plus, the prices seem a bit high to me.\n\nAs for the food, they have a decent selection for a bar and I'm impressed at the number of vegetarian options they have.  I've had the parmesan fries, fried cheese curds, and veggie pizza.  The parmesan fries are really good and the portion is large.  I have a mad crush on the cheese curds and like that they come with three different sauces depending on your mood.  I would come back to Aces and Ales for the cheese curds alone.\n\nI was completely unimpressed with the veggie pizza though.  The dough was raw in the middle, there were too many toppings so it was watery, and the mushrooms were old and funky.  I let my husband eat it.  He's not picky\n\nAnd just a fair warning not to get here starving.  Our food took forever to come out.\n\nI think I'll give Aces and Ales another go if I'm in the area.  But it's much too far to make a trip when there are plenty of other places closer to me that I know I like.\n\nI can see why there's so much love from people who appreciate beer more than I do.  I'm guessing I'm a dummy that doesn't know any better.  Oh well.\n\nPS- Be prepared to get some odd looks and maybe hear a record scratch if you walk in as a newbie.  There are definitely regulars here that notice new faces.
