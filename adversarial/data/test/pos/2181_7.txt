Stopped by to get some treats for Mother's Day.  Everything was excellent.  From the Frasier, macaron au fruit, to the almond croissant and even the pain de pie for sandwiches.  Tried the focaccia garnie that was scrumptious. Never disappointed in our selections.  If you come on a Saturday or Sunday morning there is usually a line but it doesn't take to long.  Surprised they don't have two cash registers on some of those days to move the line faster.
