People are SLEEPING on Hanshik Taco!! Wake up and smell the not-so-french FRIES!  The seasoning that Ron(owner) puts on the fries probably has some crack in it cuz it's addicting and action packed with flavor, sweet and spicy and I find myself craving it, and scratching my neck. Just playin on the scratching the neck part.\n\nAs for the taco's, I've tried every single one and my favorite is probably the beef taco, the flavors soak in it more. Second favorite is the chicken taco, ooooh SPICY!  The kimchi that's in the tacos compliment it so well.  Every single time I eat here it's just super consistent with greatness and quality.  It's just overall bomb.org yeah org as in orgasm! Bomb.com too tho.  Best of luck to this humble food truck!
