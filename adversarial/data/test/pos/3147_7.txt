Earl of Sandwich\nOverall \n3 Stars\n\nGold, Silver, Bronze medal - Roasted Beef Sandwich\n\nThe first time I heard of Earl of Sandwich was when one of my friends was raving about a new sandwich place.  Its so good, blah blah blah.  I was excited to try it.  I first saw Earl of Sandwich at Downtown Disney, but the line was EXTREMELY long.  Like a 25 minute wait at least. 25 minute wait for a sandwich shop?  WOW, now I got even more interested.\n\nI made my way to the Planet Hollywood in Vegas just to try the Earl of Sandwich.  Conclusion........ I am not impressed at all.  I tried 3 different hot sandwiches. The best out of the 3 was the roasted beef with the horseradish sauce.  It was hot and not too shabby, but definitely not 5 stars.\n\nThis located was EXTREMELY dirty too.  Unlike all the clean In n Outs you visit, the Earl of Sandwich here had trash all over the floor.  \n\nI am not sure if Earl of Sandwich was over hyped or this location was just bad, but I am not impressed at all.  There are sooo many good things to eat in Vegas, but I will not be adding Earl of Sandwich to my Vegas eats list.\n\nHAPPY SANDWICHING!
