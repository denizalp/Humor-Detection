I really wanted to like this place for my pedicures as it's close to where I live but unfortunately I will not be back. The only thing about this place that was nice was it's very clean and most of the people there were very nice with the exception of one person. My normal nail place was close so I decided to get a fill and get a pedicure at this new place . As I was hoping it would be great because I could continue to at least get my pedicures done here. But like I said unfortunately it wasn't. They sit me down and immediately the water is too cold I asked to make it hotter And the young man that was doing my pedicure acted like I was his first customer he had no idea what to do. Which he didn't. By the time my pedicure was done which didn't take that long which surprised me because I got one of the best ones you could get and it usually takes at least  30 to 45 minutes for them to do my toes at most places. My feet looked like they did when I came in. Not only did someone else have to try to get out the ingrown toenails out because he had no idea how to do it, the bottoms of my feet look like they hadn't even been done at all. They were still rough on the bottom and still had rough parts on the calluses. Now have you my feet aren't that bad but there still bad enough that you like to have soft feet after your pedicure. Then the French that they did on my toes by the next day was already peeling off. Then it was off for the nail fill. I asked for gel hard gel nails but obviously that's not what I got because The next day the polish is coming off and my nails were breaking because they were so soft. As they were doing my nails I watched as the same two guys that worked on me we're doing some other young girls pedicures and we're taking their time and doing a way better job than they did on mine. So needless to say I won't be back to this place at all. I'm giving 2 Star's for at least the nice customer service by most of them as I walked in. But I can't give anymore and that for the job they did on my toes and nails. I thought by all the reviews they did a good job but maybe I just got the wrong person. Anyways I won't be back I will continue to go to the place for my pedicures that I did before.
