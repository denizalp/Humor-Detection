Hungry for pizza so decided to give this business a try and it was worth it. The staff was very busy with lunch orders and were on the phone when I came in. They serve lunch specials here and I was in luck to caught the specials. I ended deciding on a sample type plate for $9.99 which is a large slice of cheese pizza, small portion of french fries, 3 buffalo hot wings, and a drink. The cheese slice was so good and fresh too. The buffalo wings were in mild and the sauce was very good with blue cheese sauce on the side of course for dipping.\n\nThe twins were with me and I ordered them a small 10 inch pepperoni pizza with mild hot wings too. When I checked in I was offered the free garlic balls and I redeemed them too. So thanks Napoli for thinking about yelpers, they were delicious . And the order was huge not some small sampling it is a large 6oz container and it's topped all over with Parmesan cheese. Dessert is a must and we shared a slice of the chocolate cake. The slice of cake was really dry, but the frosting on it seemed professional done. I enjoyed eating the frosting by itself too since it was so good. Not a bad place to enjoy some pizza among friends.
