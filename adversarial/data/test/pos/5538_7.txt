Wake up with the Wagners... Should be Snoring with the Boring.  Has to be the worse news team in the world.  I can't imagine these two living together, they must put each other to sleep nightly.\nHopefully NBC will pull its affiliation with this awful station whose boring owner thinks the town wants more News... OMG we want less you.. hopefully advertisers will pull their money and put it in the bank or just send to me instead of throwing away on this poorly ran channel.  Oh yeah its owned by Nevada High School Graduates.. LOL what a line.. but considering most people in Nevada has less than a high school education, I guess this is a big thing...hahahahahahah
