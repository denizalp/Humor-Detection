We had the same problem that Barbara experienced. We would love to try this restaurant with our little one. However, once my husband mentioned about bringing a stroller with us, their tone of voice became not as friendly.\n\nI am not sure why they said \"yes\" under \"good for kids\". I hope Yelp can remove it so customers with kids should not consider this restaurant.
