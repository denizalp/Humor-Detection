After years of hearing people talk about In-N-Out and going to Vegas a million times, I finally tried it.  I was so excited to finally see what the hype was all about.  Boy was I let down.  The burger was absolutely tasteless.  What is the point of going to a burger place and having a tasteless burger.  Who cares that you put a bunch of crap on it that tastes good if the burger is bland?  I don't care, i can tall you that.  I can't believe people love this place.  I am guessing they have never been to Johnny Rockets, Fat Burger, Shake Shack or anywhere else with a great fast food burger.  Boo to this place.  I'd rather eat a piece of cardboard with a bunch of sauce and cheese and crap on it.
