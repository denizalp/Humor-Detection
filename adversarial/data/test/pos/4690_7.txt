I was on the Eastside late one night way out in BFE Sunrise Manor visiting a friend. We grew hungry and were craving Chinese\/Mandarin food. I looked up Yelp and found Mandarin Express. \n\nI am glad we did because the service, delivery and food was Outstanding! \n\nWe ordered crab rangoons, war won ton soup, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and house special chicken.\n\nThe food was very hot and fresh upon delivery which was Fantastic, they don't mess around with delivery. lol\n\nA full belly is a happy belly :)
