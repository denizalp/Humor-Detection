Vibrantly painted walls with circus patterns and jester hats & faces greet you at Jester's, along with a friendly welcome from the gentlemen running the show behind the counter. \n\n(NOTE: If you have an evil clown phobia, one of the paintings may be borderline, but just remember these are jesters, not clowns. Clowns are sad men who pretend to be happy in order to make you laugh because you feel sorry for them. Pitiful.\nJesters performed out of fear for their life, though. They weren't pretending, it was genuine and real. So real that if they weren't any good....KCHXXXSZ   \"OFF WITH HIS HEAD! That's Brave. Big difference.)\n\nYou'll find a small but solid assortment of fixin's for your fully customized burrito, tacos, enchiladas, taco salad, or whatever you'd like to make from the ingredients they have, apparently!\nIn burrito form, both the chunked chicken and shredded carnitas pork were quite good. The meat is grilled fresh and simply seasoned, giving folks a chance to add heat from outside sources as desired. Considering the demographic of far north phoenix that Jester's serves, this is a much better idea than serving meat that is overspiced from the start. \n\nThe mild fire roasted salsa was also quite mild. ( a hotter version is offered, no worries ) When i mentioned to my brother that it's flavor remined me in some way of a batch of salsa that i tried to make myself once, he asked \"is that a good or a bad thing?\" \nWell, it's not a bad thing, but although i rather enjoyed it's tasty flavor -- which tasted to me as if it may have red pepper pureed into it somehow, but i could be wrong -- i will say that this mild salsa's flavorful, interesting taste is different enough from what most people are used to that it may get some criticism for that. i enjoyed it.  I didn't taste the hotter red version this time, but their Verde tomatillo salsa was absolutely delicious - tangy with a roasted mild kick to it. \n\nI will enjoy trying some other menu items at Jester's. Carnitas tacos sounds like a good short term goal. I believe I will achieve it. I was trying to bring a tie back to the jester story here, but saying that i'd come back out of bravery or out of fear for my life, as opposed to pity, would seriously convey the entirely wrong idea! \n\nGo to Jesters, like i will go back, because of the good food and friendly service. No better reason needed. At the risk of getting my head cuttoff by the king, that's no joke. \n~*KCHXXXSZ *~
