As a Delta flier based in Charlotte, I spend nearly all my time in Concourse A. All of the Delta flights (and United and Southwest and JetBlue) are shoved here by the Charlotte airport authority who have assigned nearly all the gates in the B, C, D, and E concourses to the dominant player here American Airlines.\n\nThere is very little down here in A, once you pass the two slidewalks that don't work all the time. Wendy's, Cinnabon, a bar and a gift shop. That's it. If you want more, you need to get it before getting on to the slidewalk.\n\nOne of the great things about Charlotte airport is that you don't have to leave the security zone to move from one Concourse to another. So if you're here in A and craving some great beer, the 1897 Market is not far away - try the \"Dirty Mac & Cheese\". Or Bad Daddy's Burger Bar. Or any of dozens of other eateries. You don't have to clear security again!
