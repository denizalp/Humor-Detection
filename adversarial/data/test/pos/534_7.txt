Gross.  This place is dirty.  Every surface and utensil feels crusted and sticky.  I left feeling disgusted that I actually ate the food and fed it to my children.  While there is a wide variety of dishes, none actually looked appetizing and most tasted worse than they looked.  Salad bar items were frozen blocks.  Pumpkin pie was oddly translucent.
