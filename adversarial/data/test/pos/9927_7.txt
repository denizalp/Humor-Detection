Finally after watching for months the old Fry's is now El Rancho Market and it's finally open! The grand opening was huge! This place was monster packed, all lines were over 10 people deep. They had order takers at the fresh food counter because behind the counter, they were just buried. Debit\/Credit card machines were down while the band outside played loudly. People were dancing in the parking lot which was nearly impossible to navigate! Crazy crazy! \n\nThe red and green chile looked amazingly irresistible but alas I was unable to sample any, was just to crowed! Though tomorrow is a new day, or is today a new day? Anyway, going back for a more in depth taste, oh, and some of those awesome looking in-store made tortillas!!
