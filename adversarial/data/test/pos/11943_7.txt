Not a big burger lover but when I want one I'll go to Shake Shack! Juicy, not oily or too greasy, fresh toppings and soft bun. Delicious! Fries topped with bacon and cheese complete the meal. \n\nAlso offered are hot dogs, onion rings and shakes! A variety of goodness. \n\nSummerlin location is very convenient and easier to get to than the strip. Visit them!
