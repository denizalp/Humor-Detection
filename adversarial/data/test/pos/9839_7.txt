I stopped in at the St. Lawrence Market last Saturday at around 8 AM as part of my walking tour within Centre City Toronto.  They open at 5 AM and considering that I am a morning person, I should have come earlier and for breakfast.  The historical main building (2 floors) and the North building across the street were in full swing and were filled with all sorts of wonderful\/interesting smells and fresh food options, including meats, fish, cheese, fruit, soups, sandwiches, and baked goods.  The compact kitchen gadget shop was pretty cool too.\n\nI moved on to my next destination too soon, as was meaning to come back for lunch. Definitely next time.
