Why would anyone want to go to a place like this? Everywhere you look is pure terribleness.\n\nThe place itself is sooo 30 years ago and has more awful wood veneer than the veneer room in an '80s Chrysler minivan factory.\n\nThe menu is ridiculously confusing and most (not all) of the workers are unattractive and unfriendly and simply don't care and don't care to help you.\n\nAnd the food is sooo unhealthy! After ordering a hotdog and a small fry, one of the workers was like \"Anti-diet food right there,\" he said.\n\nOh, and the bathrooms aren't much bigger than the large fries!! If you actually manage to find them and survive the climb down the veneer lined, near 90 degree angle stairs. \n\nSo why the 4 stars? Because the food truly is good and they came up with a winning idea many years ago and they're simply leaving good enough alone.
