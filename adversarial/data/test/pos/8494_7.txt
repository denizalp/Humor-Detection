Originally visited at The Center almost three years prior, a change in workplace bringing career closer than ever to a community often overlooked in society and healthcare, it was surprisingly a young patient who mentioned Bronze Café moving \"downtown\" a few weeks before actually discovering such via Social Media, the original apparently closed in September 2017 though Bronze Café at The Market has quietly been serving DTLV since late-2016.\n\nManaged by David Mozes and recently receiving accolades for one of Sin City's best Sandwiches in Las Vegas Weekly, the Café's focus on Vegan or Vegetarian fare accommodating health-conscious clientele while certainly not skimping on splurge-worthy options for those so inclined, it was in a continued effort to support local businesses through catering that contact was made with the Restaurant just 24-hours in advance, deference to David creating a spread for twenty-five that saw all appetites sated and many taking home leftovers at the end of the day.\n\nPriced akin to Goodwich and PublicUs but more centrally located at the corner of Fremont and South 6th Street, new neighbor Naked City Pizza across the street at The El Cortez yet another reason why downtown has rapidly emerged as one of Las Vegas's best places to dine, it was slightly late as a result of traffic that Mr. Mozes himself arrived porting eight boxes, three bowls and a bag, the cost well within range of most Pharmaceutical Representatives and everything presented well along with quality serviceware.\n\nUsing a quirky naming policies and tongue-in-cheek references to describe many of their signature Sandwiches or Salads, an unintuitive website interface making full-descriptions of items difficult to find without cross-referencing Facebook or Grubhub, it was largely with trust in David's picks that guests eyeballed options before making selections that saw many gather Pastries first, though those who prefer a light lunch were immediately praiseful of The Negocio Salad thanks to a light bit of heat amidst vibrant ingredients and lots of textural interplay while others preferred David's Special Salad which skews Mediterranean thanks to Curry plus bright notes of Citrus and Chickpeas.\n\nNext taking a look at \"Sammiches,\" four styles halved and each served on springy Ciabatta that offers a great chew supporting quality Organic ingredients, those favoring a more traditional Sandwich will likely find The California Turkey appealing thanks to creamy Avocado and thick-stacked Turkey Breast with Greens and bright Aioli while the \"What What\" adds intensity by way of Pepperoni and Red Onions plus dueling Dressings that reminisce of something one might find at an Italian Deli.\n\nSipping a housemade Protein Smoothie along with lunch, the Vegan concoction free of added Sugars that tastes identical to Carrot Cake easily the best meal replacement tasted in several years, it was later in the day that halves of The LGBTQ and Green Goddess Chicken Sandwich were enjoyed, the former an immense upgrade on the typical BLT while the later saw preconceptions about oily Chicken Salad replaced by refined smoothness and the sweetness of Apples plus a lingering herbal finish. \n\nEnjoying a variety of Pastries alongside the Savories and throughout the rest of the afternoon, over a dozen selections from Bronze Café's kitchen showing significant improvements from those at The Center, it was only a personal distaste for Mint with Chocolate plus slightly dry Banana-Flax Bread that prevented the entire collection from unbridled praise, the Chai and Pumpkin Spice Cookies both fragrant and fluffy without being too Cake-like while the  Strawberry Thumbprint and Peanut Butter Snickerdoodle both belong in the conversation for Las Vegas very best home-style baked goods, let alone Cookies.\n\nAgain noting Scones to be more Muffin-like than their arid British inspiration, a good thing particularly in relation to the sweet n' savory Biscuit layered in Bacon Jam, it was in an unexpected surprise that balls of puffed Millet with Pumpkin Seeds and Peanut Butter were found to be another all-natural winner packed with healthy nutrients while the Chocolate Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Loving v. Virginia, Rocky Road Cookie and Gluten-Free Vegan Cheesecake all featured high-quality Dark Chocolate in one way or another to please the chocoholic and health conscious alike.
