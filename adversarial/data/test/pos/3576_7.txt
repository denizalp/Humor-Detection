I'm sad. I got my hair done here about two years ago, and I'm still sad with the result. I had been coming here before it was color and before boychuck, yet I will never come here again. \n Start it off, I was scheduled for a block of five hours. Plenty of time for a dye job and cut. I guess not. I tell her that I have been waiting to go platinum for about a year. I had originally been going to zhane who is fantastic, but she left me for celine. Back to the story.\n\n My hair was in excellent condition. Shoulder length, dirty blonde with a tiny bit of blonde highlights at the ends that I said I was willing to cut to get rid of. I wanted to be platinum. She tells me \"I don't think I will be able to take you platinum but I will be able to take you close to it.\" I asked why at the time. I dont remember her answer. (I had been waiting to go to platinum till I got to vegas. I had plenty of other salons tell me they could take me platinum no prob). \n SO we start the process. She was nice. She was also second in line after boychuck. I believed in her. I trusted her. 6 hours later she tells me that it was taking longer than she thought. She gives me over to one of the minions that work there to finish the toning. They (two girls) tone my hair. The toner they used was so terrible I had to close my eyes and breathe through my scarf. (made my eyes water and my throat hurt) Weirdest toning experience in my life.\nToning over I'm led back to my chair and I see what they have done. I'm speechless. My hair was orange. I mean orange as in a light mandarin. What the hell. My lady comes back and say's it looks amazing. I smile with clenched teeth. She then cuts my hair as fast as she can. I ask for a bob with it a little longer in the front. She hacks my hair. I leave the salon trying to pretend it is cute. I wanted to hide. It came out to $600. \nI should of went back. I should of asked for a refund or a fix it. I didnt.\nI went home went to a local salon and asked for help. They toned it down and it came out to an odd strawberry blond. It was hell. \n To top it all off, other salon workers kept coming over and saying how good it looked and I started to believe them. (that is until I was by myself and could fully take in the the wreck that was my hair) \nBoychuck was there too and not once did he come by and see how i was doing. I was in his salon for seven hours and he not come and say hi or how's it going, I thought that was a bit odd since every other worker came by.\nDo not waste your money here.
