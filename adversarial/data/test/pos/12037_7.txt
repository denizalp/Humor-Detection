Once we made our way through the maze of strip malls and actually found the entrance to Peoria Sports Complex, I could tell right away that this was a nice stadium. Sure it's a little off the beaten path, but it's worth the drive. \n\nHome to the Mariners and Padres, this truly is another state of the art spring training facility. Parking is $5 but there's plenty of it and I really enjoyed the multiple golf carts driving around that offer visitors a ride to and from their car, especially on an uncommonly hot day like last Saturday. We first went to the sales window and upon realizing that will call was on the other side, a staffer driving a golf cart gave us a friendly ride to the other side. Once we picked up our tickets, we were inside and to our seats within minutes. \n\nThe stadium is really nice. I don't think there's a bad seat in the entire ballpark, including on the grass. I will say that if you like to sit in the shade, plan accordingly because not many of the seats are graced with shade. I noted that the only seats with shade are the ones directly below the announcer's boxes, even the ones under the overhang get some sunlight from sun peaking through the roof. But, just lather on that sunscreen and you'll be good to go!                     \n\nI really enjoyed the crowd here at Peoria Sports Complex. Some of the stadiums can get extremely rowdy during the game and for some are the front for spring break 2011 (I don't even think they realize a game is going on). However, the crowd here was much more relaxed so I think this is a good \"off the beaten path\" stadium where people aren't quite as rowdy and instead are just there to have a couple beers and a good time in the sun watching baseball. \n\nNow let's move on to the food. I probably could have eaten my way through this stadium and I would have been happy. I saw a frozen yogurt stand, a flat bread stand, funnel cake, kettle corn, Hawaiian noodles, BBQ, gyros, pizza...you name it, this stadium has it. It's like a carnival with a baseball game in the background. While I mentally ate everything mentioned above, I psychically only had half of a hot dog and when I say half, I mean half of a foot-long sausage which technically means I had a whole hot dog. The sausage was really god and barbecued fresh in front of our very eyes. I highly suggest trying it out..and then have some funnel cake and maybe some fry bread and maybe some fro yo? You'll roll out of there but who cares when there is so much good ballpark food to choose from! \n\nI think the Peoria Sports Complex has done an incredible job and truly making it a \"take me out to the ballgame\" day and I happily drive the distance for a game out here.
