This restaurant was a hit and also a miss.\n\nLet me give you a hit about this restaurant: the food is good; the interior has an unusual atmosphere and there are those little arcade games that you might want to play with. Plus, it oven stays open until at least 3:00 a.m. and I didn't even know that it also offers desserts that a part of me always wanted to try out. The service is pretty good too.\n\nNow, here's a miss: I was there with my family and my (now ex) older brother (whom I cut out of my life two years ago) was being an abusive bastard to me, even screaming at me (and his own parents too) and even throwing loud temper tantrums in front of the entire restaurant. He was literally humiliating me by doing so and even screamed \"shut up\" to my face. I'm already crying while typing this, since all of his tantrums, along with his rage and hatred of me, literally ruined our family outing in that restaurant. I mean---I wanted to like that restaurant, the food, everything, but no, he just had to ruin it for me!\n\nOh well, maybe next time, I might think of going again, but not with my ex-brother.
