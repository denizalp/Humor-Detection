quick visit to Manan last week to satisfy a sweet tooth.  Sadly, I was let down.\n\nTried several items ( didn't write down the actual names so I will go with the \"Americanized\" names ) :\n\nBrownie, chocolate cake, cheesecake and opera cake.  The brownie was very dense but lacking in chocolate flavor.  The cheesecake did not taste very fresh.  The opera cake was also old and the cake was very, very dry.  We didn't even try the chocolate cake.\n\nThe service was good - the lady that handled my order was very nice.  Unfortunately, none of the items I selected have me wanting to return.\n\npics included
