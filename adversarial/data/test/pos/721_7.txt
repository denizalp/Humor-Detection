Total Bush League here.\nTried to go in to get some info on storage rentals.\nThere was a little handwritten note on the door, with a phone number written so small you could barely read it...asking you to call that number if you needed any help.\nI have better things to do than try to decipher a note on a door.\nI went to Public Storage on Chandler.
