I had a chance to just go out with my daughter today for a little father daughter time. So she likes the Good Egg and so it was. \n\nWalked in and it just reminds me of all those breakfast houses. Nothing really jumps out. Let's just say the decor is all breakfast(ie) like. \n\nOrdered the orange juicy and coffee with the Sun Devil omelette. The omelette had diced ham, peppers, and onions. Nothing special about this. All I really tasted was the eggs. Didn't have any flavor. Pretty disappointed. Hash browns and English muffin were the norm, but I did enjoy the OJ and coffee. \n\nMy daughter had the Pineapple Upside Down pancakes. Two huge cakes taking up her whole plate with pineapples, grapes, and whip cream on top. I snuck a few bites and it was really good. Walnuts in the middle with a pretty good syrup. Pancakes were not dry at all and pretty filling. \n\nOur server was really good and very attentive to us. They gave us our own pitcher of water and coffee. So overall the food was okay with pretty good service. Not bad but I could find better breakfast joints to go to.
