This review is for the Motley Brews Craft Beer Tailgate Festival at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip (the new one by the M&M and Cola store).\n\nOverall it's a pretty decent festival with a few setbacks. \n\nThe good: \nThe variety was nice with a few breweries that you'd have trouble obtaining anywhere close without the distribution in Vegas. There was enough space...I'm sure they wan't it packed, but some festivals are way past capacity or at a venue too small too start with that it isn't fun anymore. You can spend time asking questions about brews you like so it made for it being more intimate. \n\nI LOVE BEERS!!\n\nSoooo I was really happy the a few wholesalers were there. Bevi Beverages brought some imports that you're not gonna find distributed to stores around town. Good luck if you want some of them though I'm sure you can ask who are they selling it wholesale to (ppsstt. I found some Italian imports at Ferraros so far, trying to find others). A few smaller breweries I haven't heard of that was pretty good like Knee Deep (Tahnilla was lovely- planning to get this for a beer dessert preparation). A few imports that I need to figure out to get (if only I can remember all those damn Birrificos).  \n\nMore good comes from the proceeds of the event. $30-35 is really reasonable to try out some awesome beers and c'mon, part goes to a charity (Boys and Girls Club of America this year) so it's a deal. \n\nThe bad:\nWe were standing outside in line and couldn't go in for what? It was already nearly 2 and a bulk of the people are downstairs instead of cueing on the 2nd floor stairs already to just keep it all steady instead of big rushes on people like that. \n\nThe ugly:\nThat motherfucking venue parking lot. You try the 50 degree incline ramp of the Showcase parking lot with a STICK SHIFT and douchebags in front of you who are stuck because of the asshole architect doesn't have common sense to go with their diploma and decided to make it where people pay first (yes, you actually pay $3 to park....casinos and pretty much everywhere else- free) thus backing up the line onto said incline. Burnt tires and hoping we don't roll far enough to hit a car behind is pretty ugly. I know it's not Motley Brews fault, but if this is the venue for the next one- AVOID. Go to MGM or MonteCarlo and get some exercise. \n\nThe buffet line is pretty clusterfucked. It's slow...soo slow. Small plates- really?! Won't stop making people eat less but makes it an even slower line with people having a hard time putting enough food on too small several plates and their beer glass. Choice of food- do it yourself nacho area SEEMS cool of an idea, but with everyone slowly stacking and maybe 2 people max being able to  do it at a time, it's backing up the line greatly. It should have been a bunch of pre- prepped, ready to scoop up finger foods and maybe some chips and guac, but fuck the meats, bean, cheese, jalapeno, sour cream, beans, 2 salsas, etc. etc, etc... Took 30 minutes to get some appetizers, yet takes maybe 5seconds-1minute to get a beer. Food is ESSENTIAL to be able to taste so many beers....empty stomach is a unhappy, quick drunk. It could of course, be on fault with Hard Rock and out of Motley Brews control what's served. Definitely the plates can easily be the restaurant not having enough big plates...which is kinda shocking for a big place. \n\nI think they did good and if they can work on the few traffic jam lines it would definitely be \"the\" Vegas festival to go to. We definitely enjoyed ourselves and would consider doing the next Motley Brews event. Definitely gotta thank Yelp\/Misti\/Motley Brews for the ticket contest giveaway or else I might not have discovered Motley Brews.
