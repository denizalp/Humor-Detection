I really want to like this place. It's a mom and pop Italian place in an area when everything is Chain. I've been here a few times. Always hoping it would be better then the time before. It wasn't. On my first visit our server brought out champaign glasses with an inch of water in them and had no idea how to open the bottle of champagne. Then disappeared for most of the meal. That seems to be the going trend with this place. I've had under cooked pasta, stale bread, dry chicken and egg shell in deserts. I feel they are over priced and not worth the $20 they charge for a basic dish. This is not a place I will be visiting again. I tried I really did but in the end I always left disappointed.
