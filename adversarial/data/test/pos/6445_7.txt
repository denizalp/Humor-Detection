Best free show in Vegas. I never get tired of the Bellagio fountains. Last time I went was during Memorial Day, and the song that the fountains danced to was \"Proud to be an American.\" Highly appropriate and very well done. If you want a closer look, get there a few minutes early before it starts so you can get a good spot by the railing--this place draws the crowds more than anything on the strip I think. Watch your feet, or the moms with strollers will get you.
