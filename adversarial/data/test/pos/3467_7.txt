Every dish is made with lots of love and care. The way each ingredient is put together is well thought out. Mesa doesn't have much going on but this is definitely the new hot spot in town. The fried chicken sandwich was amazing. The chicken was some of the best fried chicken breast I've ever had. The pickles in the sandwich were like wow! The banana pudding is a must. Don't leave here without ordering one. Mesa's gem is here at Worth Takeaway! \n\nRecommendation: Fried chicken sandwich and banana pudding
