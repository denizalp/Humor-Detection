Left him a voice mail with my phone number asking for an estimate.  No call back.  Went with another painter.\n\nSince this man is now calling me a liar with a \"fake review\", here is the information from my phone log...\nI called you on 3\/30\/2014 @ 4:48 PM AZ time and left you a message giving both my name and phone number several times in the message as well as what I wanted to have done.  This is not a fake review.\n\nHad you called me back or even replied here with something other than hate, I could have corrected my review or even removed it.  Now, I think I will leave it, so others can see the kind of treatment they will get if they make you angry.  Very glad I never let you into my home.
