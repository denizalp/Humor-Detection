In a city with so many Taco spots springing up, I had high hopes for some no nonsense authentic Mexican food.\n\nImagine my crushing defeat when all I got were oily, bland, tepid tacos. The heartburn after was a nice touch. Save your money and go to El Trompo instead.\n\nI award Rebozos no stars, and may god have mercy on their souls.
