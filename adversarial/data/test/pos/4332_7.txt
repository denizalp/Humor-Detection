This was my first time here and I think I spent an hour shopping and I only visited half the store lol. Price is very reasonable and the veggies are good quality. Can't say anything about the meats because i didn't make it that far. \n\nCashier was nice and friendly. She was super patient because it took me awhile to bag my own groceries.
