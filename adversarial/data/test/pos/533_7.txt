Great live music, great pies!\n\nWe came to support a friend who was performing that evening.  It's nice and cozy in there, but made It a pretty tight fit for the seven of us diners. The musicians were tucked in a corner, which made it a little hard to see them, but they sounded fabulous!\n\nFor apps, we ordered roasted garlic and brie with pita triangles. Half off all apps and some drinks during happy hour 4pm-7pm!  Hubby eyed Nonna's favorite gluten free crust with Queen Creek olive oil, fresh garlic, fontina, mozzarella, mushrooms, fresh organic Roma tomatoes, chevre (goat cheese), Kalamata olives, topped with fresh basil. was pretty good with a cabernet.   It was so good, my little cutie pie gave that pie a thumbs up!   The medium sized Greek salad was a good portion, hubby and I shared it.  I wasn't too crazy about the creamy dressing, it needed a little zing to it, so I asked for more balsamic.  Our server gave me more of the same dressing which didn't satisfy my taste buds.  Then I figured it was missing some citrus punch to it.  I will ask for lime or lemon next time.  \n\nThe dessert menu didn't really appeal to us.  The selection offered was more like an afterthought.  My little cutie pie settled for vanilla ice cream drizzled with choco fudge (they were out of gelato).\n\nThe service was good.  The price was good.  We will shall return.
