This business recently opened where Martha's Kitchen used to be. Located in a small strip mall on the corner of Higley rd. and Southern rd. this quaint little restaurant serves authentic Mexican food. Today my curiosity got the best of me as I live almost across the street. I stopped in for lunch on taco Tuesday. The special is 12 rolled tacos for $10.99. I thought this was going to be a small menu, but to my delight it is pretty extensive. They offer free chips and salsa while you wait for your order. You can watch Telemundo on the TV or listen to Spanish music in the background.\nI ordered a carnita burro. For me I rate a Mexican restaurant based on the quality of their burrito. Tacos are pretty standard, but burritos can vary greatly. Now if I know any Spanish at all, Burrito would be a small burro. Here they are called burros for a good reason. The one I got was nearly a foot long and weighed at least a pound. It was very warm and hard to hold on to. The burro was filled with grilled steak, rice, beans, and garnished with cilantro. It was not highly seasoned for people with sensitive palates, but there is a condiment stand where you can spice it up as I did. \nI don't know much about the business except that they have another store at 415 E. McKellips in Mesa. I like this place. It's good food right in my backyard. I hope this one stays around a while as businesses in this location come and go.
