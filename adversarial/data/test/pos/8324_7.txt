It's like Bill Nye the Science Guy created an indoor park.\n\nHere are my three tips: 1) Dress comfortably. Don't wear skinny jeans. You'll be chasing your kids up and down multiple flights of stairs through a spiraling maze-like staircase. However, if you insist on killing all of the fun for the sake of fashion, then slap on your skinny jeans and use the elevator which can comfortably transport 40 adults or 20 adults with strollers. 2) Make sure there are two adults in your group. Kids cannot resist going down all of the slides they will encounter as they traverse through the spiraling staircase. One second they're in front of you. The next second they're two flights below you. And, since you are wearing your very fashionable skinny jeans, you cannot bend down far enough to get in the slide without exposing the crack of your ass. So, all you can do is scream, \"Parker! Get back up here! Why did you go down that slide? Parker!!!\" I'm just sayin...it would be nice to have an adult trailing the pack. 3) Bring some water. The kids will need it.\n\nLots of fun and exploration for the kids. It's a little too crowded on the weekends and much more enjoyable on a week day. General admission is $12 and children under 1 are free.
