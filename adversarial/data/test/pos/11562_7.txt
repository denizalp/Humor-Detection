I don't know why I never came here. Maybe because it's not a cool place. At all. The vibe reminds me of the now defunct Roxy Cafe in South Hills Village. Just screaming early 90's, carpet everywhere, awful frilly fixtures and unneccesary flourishes all over the place.  \n\nBut close your eyes and have a go at the bread and pasta. It's nearly impossible to go wrong with house made fresh pasta and theirs wasn't bad at all. The bread ruled. The bar menu was not a joke, featuring the likes of East End and Bell's, cocktails that weren't a punchline, probably good wine (I don't know anything in that dept. so I could be dead wrong, but my wife's house red was great). \n\nIt's not that cheap, and they make you pay for parking. And I still don't feel cool. But if there is a better-textured pasta in Pittsburgh I haven't had it. I always thought I would hate this place but I honestly liked it, a lot. So I guess don't be a closed minded jerk and deprive yourself of nice Italian food for no good reason.
