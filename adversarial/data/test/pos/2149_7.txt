I guess my review is now \"in Memoriam\" - a bit shocked to hear this place has closed. However, when I came to meet friends here for dinner I did note that it was really tucked away and not very visible from the road.\n\nMy visit was on an evening when there was a \"switcheroo\/restaurant swap\" with Paul Verica from Heritage. So in reality, I was eating Chef Vericas food.\n\nThe breakdown: Guacamole with sunchoke chips\n                           Duck Confit\n                           Empanadas\n                           Tacos\n                           Excellent server, selection of draughts\/wines, sangria\n                           The best thing = Cookies and Cream dessert - just look at my picture - a\n                                                      beautiful and fantastic composition of flavors!!!\n\nI wish Chef Aaron the best and heard a rumor he moved to Colorado!!
