Uber is garbage in this city. In the age of smartphones and Google Maps, the drivers are still trying to scam people with their creative routes.\n\nI needed to just go east from the airport. First Uber guy went North, then West past the freeway. At this point I'm asking him wth is going on. Then we had to go South, then East, then North again. Basically took 3 times as long.\n\nSecond driver I asked to go to Aria. I see the giant building right there, but she drives past it. Then after I talked to her, she finally made two right turns to bring us back.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that they know the route, and purposely program some creative stuff in their Google Maps navigation. Then they'd pretend to follow the Maps route as if Google gave it to them. Totally dishonest and a waste of time.
