Find another company. \n\nAttended a wedding off strip and AWG was hired to shuttle 130 guests to and from the venue from the MGM Grand. The buses did not show up at the designated time. After several phone calls, 2 buses arrived 45min late (there was supposed to be 3). Not only was the management staff rude and unprofessional but the drivers got lost and had no idea how to get to the venue. \n\nNeedless to say the wedding did not start on time and several guest paid out of pocket to get transportation. This was booked and paid for weeks in advance so the drivers should have been prepared. There are to many choices in Vegas for any company to be that unprepared and that rude and unprofessional. \n\nI have owned a limousine company and the way the situation was handled was unacceptable. I would never hire this company.
