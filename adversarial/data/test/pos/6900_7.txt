So I had to go here  to exchange some dollars to Thailand Bahts, Philippine Pesos, and Korean Wons for my Asian trip. This was was located on convention drive Between Paradise and Las Vegas Blvd near the Ross.\n\nKinda far from where I love. I live in Henderson but oh well it's the only place that gives good rates on foreign currencies.\n\nThis place is great if you ever need to change dollars to whatever currencies. It beats waiting in the banks for your money to come and they will not rip you off.\n\nThis place is by far the best when it comes to exchange rates. I have been coming here since for about 12 years now at least once or twice a year.\n\nThe staff is great parking sucks though i recommend parking across the street over near the Ross and just walk to the building this place is located at.\n\nI highly recommend this place for all your foreign exchange currencies you need done before you leave for your trip or for when you come back!
