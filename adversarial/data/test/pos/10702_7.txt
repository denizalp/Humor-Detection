DAYUM... this place is BAD LOL. Unbelievably bad. Like a  \"how can you actually run a restaurant this bad\" bad. A \"I can't believe I spent money here\" bad. \n\nCame here on a blazing hot day, and I don't think they had the A\/C running properly. So the owner suggested for us to sit at the back where it was supposed to have been cooler (it wasn't really thaaaat much cooler). Good thing we didn't sit in for long, otherwise I would have melllteeedddd.\n\nAnyhoo, we only ordered a couple snacks because I really didn't have high hopes for this place. They were also out of the \"silver needle\" noodles when we were here. \nBut we ordered some HK snack staples: \n- Fish siu mai: So bad. Omg this was literally those packages of frozen fish siumai that you buy at asian grocery stores and nuke em till they're warm. \n- Steamed rice rolls: Average... but way overpriced for the amount they give you.\n- Imitation shark fin soup: This was literally the worst thing ever. I kid you not, it was just pieces of vermicelli + dry overcooked chicken strands in a soy sauce broth. Granted, the Chinese translation said it was \"雞粉絲碗仔翅\"... I just didn't expect it to LITERALLY be just vermicelli and chicken. Usually imitation fin soup comes with other toppings... so disappointed. Ok but not only were the toppings totally gross but consistency of this soup was just watery when it's supposed to be thick. All in all this was gross a f. \n\nSide note: I noticed that the other tables were all ordering their omelette fried rice. IT'S $18 FAM. And that portion does NOTTTTT match the price. (Maybe the taste is worth $18 but c'mon... $18 fried rice at a place like this???)\n\nBeing the nosy person I am (hehe), I was listening to the owner talk with a table behind me. She was explaining to them that she only uses high quality ingredients and no MSG. For example, she said she doesn't use frozen corn in her dishes, the corn she uses is freshly cut from the cob. Example #2, she said the eggs she uses are organic. I guess this is how she justifies the high prices she charges. (Totally subjective, but the owner sounded super obnoxious while talking to that table) \n\nThe only positive part of this place would be the decor maybe? It is kinda cute, got some old school HK vibes. (Although any true HKer would be appalled at this place, jus sayin)\n\nTotally not coming back. Straight disrespect to HK style food smh.
