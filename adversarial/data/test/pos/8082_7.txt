I went here for a groupon I purchased & they told me new ownership even though it's the same menu as before so groupon is no good. So I ordered a chicken gyro that barely had any meat on it & some stale\/chewy chips. They offered me a complimentary brownie which was very dry. I spit out the 1st bite & didn't eat it. They had complimentary water which was room temp. I highly don't recommend this place.
