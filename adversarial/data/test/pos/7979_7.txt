Perfect solution for the, \"what do you want for dinner\" dilemma. This place produces by far best chicken pot pies in Vegas. My ultimate favorite crust is the cheddar crust which provides just a small kick of cheddar flavor.  When this place first opened, I remembered the pies had an overpowering rosemary taste. It took them a couple of weeks, but they perfected the recipe and flavors are on point. I tried the steak pot pie and wasn't a fan. The meat was very chewy and the pie was watery. The curry pot pie was delicious, however it was at about a spicy level 8. It would be cool to have a pot pie with potato and hamburger. Also, a bacon crust. The large size is perfect for three people. The apartment size is good for two people. The individual is a perfect proportion size for one person. I tend to get four frozen individual pies to keep in the freezer and two not frozen individual pies for dinner. Don't want to cook dinner, Pie Me Over really offers the perfect solution! The staff is very friendly and helpful. They provide service with a smile!
