This coming from someone who doesn't like sweets all that much: Pour that homemade, warm, caramel sauce on me and call me Sally, baby.\n\nSweet mother of \"Moses\" this place is derrricious. \n\nNostalgia out the tush for a new fountain shop? A little tricky, but they nailed it. I felt like I was transported back to a simpler time when ice cream cured all, no matter what the problem. Oh wait... it still does? Well it does here. \n\nI'm a simple creature--one who appreciates simple flavors. I ordered a single scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream and warm caramel sauce. ZOMG--perfection. You know how warm caramel get's chewier against the cold ice cream? I'm drooling right this second. \n\nJason got the Gordon Square which featured a homemade brownie, hot chocolate and caramel sauce and their special bananas foster ice cream. All I can say is that afterwards, he said he could spend a weekend there eating everything and not get sick of it. And the boy? Well they made him a special rootbeer float that they don't normally make since he was good at school that week. Umm, you win my loyalty if you're good to the kids. \n\nI have a funny feeling we'll be spending a lot of time here this summer. Oh, and it's the perfect \"bring your out-of-town-visitors\" kind of place too.
