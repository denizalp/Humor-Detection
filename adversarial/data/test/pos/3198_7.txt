One of my new favorite spots.  I've gone in the day and I absolutely love it.  \nThat being said, the douche factor is SUPER high in the evening. Once it hits dark, holy crap the douches and cougars come rolling out.\n\nHowever, for a lunch spot or happy hour location, I'm a fan.  The food is fresh , unqiue, and very reasonably priced.   It's a bit confusing because it is an Asian\/mesican fusion. So you can order sushi and a taco.  A bit odd at first, but just go with it.  It works somehow.  \n\nThe sushi is fresh and the Mexican Pho is my go to.  The pho portion size is enormous and is more than enough for a lunch\/dinner. Be sure to order the Mexican Street Corn as it is outstanding!!
