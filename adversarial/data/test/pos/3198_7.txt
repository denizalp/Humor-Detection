What can I say.. I got the #3 and a side of fried okra, It was good.   I tried my friends catfish, I'd have to say it was some of the best catfish ive had in a while.  I also sampled my other friends grits and rice and gravy.. MMM M.  The chicken was excellent, just the right ammount of fried and a great flavor, and the waffles were tasty.  As stated below, I wish the chicken pieces were a little bigger...but then it would hurt to finish my plate.
