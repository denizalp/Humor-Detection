What a genius innovation to come to Madison!\n\nDined here with the family for pawpaw's birthday. You select your choice of meat and style of broth from the menu. Simple as that. Select any add-ons that you wish. Proceed to the sauce bar in the back of the room and make your concoction. My favorite part is the freshly, crushed garlic. My own recipe goes a little like this: 1 tbsp crushed garlic, 2 tbsps sesame oil, 1 tbsp Mongolian Sauce, and a dash of salt. Just like grandpop used to make! \n\nThere are a bucket of raw eggs to add to your already mounting plate of food and sensory. You can do one of two things, crack it open in your boiling pot, or put the egg with shell in the broth for a hard boiled egg.\n\nTwo noodles await your gleaming eyes; mung bean (glass) noodles and yellow lo mein noodles.\n\nThe gracious waitress will bring you a plate of veggies containing spam, wienies, fish balls, fried and fresh tofu.\n\nWe tried the Korean Kimchi and Sichuan Spicy Broth. There are white peppercorn and dried red chilis in the Sichuan broth, don't attempt unless you're ready to handle the heat. For the tamer palate, lots of plain broth had to be added to ease the burn. As I type this, Sucker for Pain is playing on Pandora, huh. I would say, the Sichuan broth is still not 'ma-la' as you would find in a real hot pot restaurant in Chengdu, but still - pretty authentic. \n\nYou can really tell the owners take pride in their product, even going around and checking on every table in the house and refilling the broths if they are running low.\n\nOh, and they have boba teas!!
