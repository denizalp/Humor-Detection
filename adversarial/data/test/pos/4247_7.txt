Do we have a complete lack of intelligence here? It's not rocket science.\n\nI was totally unimpressed with this location, but I did end up with a GREAT funny story to re-tell over and over. Math is not the strength of our future youth that work here, tried to explain twice and still got no where.\n\nI hope you have better luck... and maybe better review of this dive
