Oh boy, my waistline is going to hate me for discovering this delightful bakery! I've been reading about the delicacies found at Karl's for sometime now and this past week, I was in the area and finally had the chance to stop by!\n\nI wish more local bakeries like Karl's existed in the Valley. It's the type of bakery that you walk into and are immediately greeted by a smiling face and a whiff of delectable smells coming from the oven. The counter is full of rows of baked goodness including muffins, pastries, donuts, breads and desserts. Everything looks tempting and I could probably just eat my way through the bakery. \n\nSince it was triple digit weather and I wasn't going straight home, my choices were limited since many of the items have cream in them, but I did manage to take home several fresh muffins that were fluffy and moist. I also noticed delicious donuts, including cronuts! Everything is homemade and fresh. I will be visiting Karl's in the future for fresh loaves of bread, pastries and desserts. \n\n*** When you visit Karl's, make sure you pay a visit to the Baker's Daughter next door!
