My favorite omelet lives here :)\nIt's my own personal build your own combination of chorizo, pepper jack cheese, onions, bell peppers & sour cream. PERFECTION!\n\nI remember the coffee tasting better, then I added sugar & it was transformed back to a great cup of coffee. I haven't added sugar to coffee in years, but I think here I'll make an exception, lol. \n\nThis location is a lot larger than the previous one. Having no waiting was a nice change!
