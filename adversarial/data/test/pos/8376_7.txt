I had previously taken my dogs to the Scottsdale location for their dental cleanings but I decided to use the Gilbert office due to the closer location from where I live. Getting there is a breeze from the 60, and the drive from Tempe is a lot nicer than taking the 101 or surface streets to Scottsdale.\n\nThe parking lot is a little narrow and it doesn't seem like there are as many spots as the Scottsdale location which is located in a shopping plaza. I didn't have any problems finding a spot though. The dental office is part of a whole conglomeration of various veterinary specialist offices and shares space with veterinary opthalmology and dermatology. \n\nMy appointment was at 8 AM and I got here a little early. Unfortunately none of the front office staff were here yet at 7:45 and quite a few other people and their dogs were waiting awkwardly with their dogs either in their cars or outside. I understand that the office doesn't technically open until 8 but I feel like not being able to enter the office at a reasonably early time and making us wait adds to the potential stress of an appointment. They did finally open 5 minutes before 8.\n\nAt the counter there is a front office person for each specialty. The waiting room is fairly spacious with nice seating.\n\nWe were taken back shortly and the front desk who doubled as an assistant went over the procedure for the appointment and explained all the paperwork to sign. We also arranged a pick up time.\n\nWhen my dog's dental cleaning was over I received a phone call from the tech saying he did great and there were no problems. When I arrived to pick my pup up Dr. Balke did an excellent job at explaining how everything went and went over the radiographs and blood work.\n\nThe front desk\/assistant was so friendly and engaging and I felt like my dog was given the best care and comfort by her and the other techs. \n\nOverall I'll definitely come here again due to the convenient location and friendly staff.
