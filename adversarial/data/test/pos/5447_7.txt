Jon is the only reason I did not give five stars. He is the first person you will encounter at the register and he is miserable and rude. I am glad there is one in LA now because when I come back to Phoenix I will not be returning here. Anyway the food was very expensive but it was very good. The fried buttermilk chicken sandwich could put chic fil a out of business if it was cheaper. The bun was soft just a little too much lettuce. Although cheese fries were good they can definitely stand on their own without sauce, I will order plain next time. The lemonade was also tasty. Plenty of seating, chill decor, and outside seating.
