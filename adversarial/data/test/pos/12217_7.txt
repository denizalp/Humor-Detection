Do not get your fence from Budget 1 Fence!  Here's my experience: \n\n- My husband and I were in the market to get a new fence and we shopped around to get quotes from several local fence companies. \n- We decided to go with Budget 1 Fence because they were the cheapest... but soon regretted our decision.   \n- After I signed the contract with Budget 1 Fence I learned that this company has a reputation for screwing over their customers.  Budget 1 Fence constantly changes their company name every few years in order to look like a new business and rid themselves of the several negative reviews they receive. \n- When the fence was installed, they RUINED all of the grass and everything around the fence and would not own up to the mess they made in the yard. \n- For our particular fence, we needed to get a variance to build the fence on the side of our house so they only installed part of the fence and the plan was for Budget to finish the fence after the variance was approved.  Budget took a small amount of money off the original quote and promised they would finish the fence at the amount they took off. \n- After the variance was approved I called Budget back and they promised me for WEEKS that they would come out and reevaluate the fence so they could start the job.  After a month of multiple phone calls, the owner said he would not complete my fence even though they had already negotiated a rate and promised me they would finish the job. \n- The business owner then started CURSING AT ME after I mentioned that we had already negotiated a contract. \n\nIn summary, the price may seem attractive but these are not people I would ever let near my home again after the way the business owner treated me.  Please save yourself the hassle and do not go to Budget 1 Fence.
