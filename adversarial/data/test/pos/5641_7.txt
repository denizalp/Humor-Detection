This is it! This still stands as my most favorite Thai Restaurant ever! I love the food here. Plus, the minute you walk in the wonderful smell of all the spices is so warm and inviting. It is cosey in here and romantic ,smells great, and has great service. So it is a win, win all the way around.\nEverything I have ever tried here has been delicious,but my favorite is still the Yellow Chicken Curry.\nLots of parking in the back, right next door to Durant's on Central.
