Like hiking? Well, here you go!\n\nI remember years ago (and I mean years!) on my way to Red Rock Canyon I'd see the sign for Calico Basin Red Springs and not pay much attention to it. Back then there must've been only one or two homes back there! Now there are more homes, and a parking lot for visitors.\n\nRight near the parking lot there are shaded picnic tables and public bathrooms. I have seen families in large and small groups do their BBQ there and have a blast. There is a boardwalk that goes around the spring, but if you are a more serious hiker, pick up the trail head on the left of the spring and go! Make sure you have good hiking boots and plenty of water. The terrain can get a bit challenging especially if you go off the beaten path and depending on the time of the year, it could get very hot. If you are going late in the afternoon, make sure you have a flashlight in your backpack because if for some reason you are still there when it gets dark, you'll need it!
