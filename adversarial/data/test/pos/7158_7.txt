When we first walked into the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess to be walked over to our table but decided to hang out at the bar for a bit til the rest of the group arrived. When we were ready to be sat, the hostess and servers were extremely helpful and offered to transfer our open tabs to the table. \n\nOur group shared a few appetizers that were pretty good. \nEveryone's favorite was the octopus though... we liked it so much that we had to order a second order. \n\nFor dinner our table decided to stick to only ordering from the heritage steaks. We got the skirt, wagyu, and the filet. The wagyu was obviously the best but that pricetag...yikes. Regardless the piece of meat was a work of art. It was incredibly tender and pretty much just melted in your mouth. There was very little chewing that had to be done. Probably the most rich and flavorful piece of cow I've ever consumed. Puts a smile on my face thinking about it...\n\nAs far as sides go, nothing stood out but the brussell sprouts. Very good flavor.\n\nThe restaurant is modern and clean with dark wood accents. Lighting sets the mood for a nice dinner out. Overall I loved the layout, however it's a bit confusing when youre looking for the restrooms. I accidentally almost walked into the kitchen twice trying to find the restrooms...but everything happens for a reason...I ended up getting a tour of the back and front kitchen from one of the GMs. They really knew how to make a girl feel special  ^*^\n\nThe service was perfect. The servers not only gave us great suggestions but also brought everything out in a timely manner. I was in and out of a full service meal in less than 2 hours and made it to work with time to spare. \n\nThe tour of the kitchen really gave me a sense of how things were done here at Heritage and how seriously they take their craft. I guarantee that I will be back.
