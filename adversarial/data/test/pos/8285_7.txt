Great food! Made me feel like I was in Rowland Heights, CA. That's a big compliment because there are Hong Kong style cafes everywhere you turn in RH. And they have great food. Well, this place didn't fall behind in any aspect.\n\nThe Chili chicken dimpling is very good. The fried dimpling was average. The fried Shrimp was crispy and flavorful. The Chili salt chicken wings were excellent! The black pepper chicken over Brown rice was very good as well. Overall, very good food and service! \n\nGreat job being the first Hong Kong style cafe in AZ! I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.
