Never heard of these guys until somebody mentioned it to me after they saw them. So off we went on a late sunday afternoon. \n\nPerforming at the Windows Showroom inside Bally's Hotel and Casino, The Bronx Wanderers consists of a father and his two sons accompanied by 3 other members. They all can sing and play instruments. They sing mainly old school do wop. Songs that groups did in the 60's and 70's from the likes of Frankie Valli and the Beach Boys. \n\nThey even sang Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen and Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars. In my opinion they have no limit as to what genre they perform. They are that good. As a matter of fact, I took my aunt and uncle to see them which was my second time. They came back the next weekend with some of their friends to watch it again.\n\nIn closing, I highly recommend checking these guys out before whoever makes the decision to pull the plug does it soon. It seems like most shows nowadays in Vegas have a short lifespan. The skills and talents these guys portray onstage is worthy of seeing at least twice just to verify that they can do it all over again. Go see them. You will not be disappointed.\n\nYelp 2017 Review #6\n639 overall
