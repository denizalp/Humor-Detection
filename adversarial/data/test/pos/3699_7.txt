This was a pleasant surprise, my friends and I walked around forever trying to find a place to eat and because I was having a toothache I really didn't want to go to a buffet but long story short we ended up here...\n\nSat night-short line.. I was a bit nervous.. WHY SO EASY?!\n\nthe food was actually pretty good, decent meat selection, food quality was not bad at all, the variety was a bit lacking but it was enough! we all got one free glass of wine too which was a nice surprise. \n\ndesserts would probably have to be their strongest part though, with the dessert bar and crepe station it was a home run!
