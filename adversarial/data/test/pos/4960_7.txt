I really hope that the Golden Nugget pool manager reads this review and does something about it.  I love the Golden Nugget.  A lot of us do.  I really like the Hideout pool ... but ... ~ aside from the fact that it is not exclusive when you jam so many people in it that the pool becomes a wading \/ dipping pool, and the lounge chairs are touching each other and the day beds, with no space in between them ~  we now live in a world of extreme temperatures folks.  If I'm going to pay $195 for a bed at the Hideout, I'd really like to have some kind of UMBRELLA.  Yes, I did just yell that. I don't want to have to abandon the bed at 1:00 because the wall shade went away.  I wasn't the only person.  I saw a number of abandons during my two hot days there.  It was like the Tour de France on a pave stage, I swear.\n\nYou can still jam people in, and put an umbrella stand under the beds and chairs, with just a little itty bitty pole in between.  Or what the hey, have the server come by and ask us if we'd like to buy the shade.  With summer temperatures regularly hitting 110 Â° or higher, you could make bank selling shade at the Hideout.  \n\nOr just have happier, healthier less melanoma-ridden pool guests, and give the shade away.\n\nI mean, seriously, the DJ has two umbrellas.  He is a paid employee and we are paying you to be there.\n\nJUST GET SOME UMBRELLAS PLEASE!  PLEASE!
