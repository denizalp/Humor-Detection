First food stand I saw coming in from the mall entrance by Dillard's. The smell was amazing. I ordered the pizza bites which were mini pretzels with cheese and pepperoni. I got a side of pizza sauce. They were delicious! Fianc√©e and her mom shared the cinnamon bites which were also a hit. Cashier was quick and friendly!
