Was fortunate enough to catch a great Suns game (even though they lost in the end) about two Christmases ago courtesy of an acquaintance.  Nice seats, too.  ($30+ for a seat in the nosebleed sections?  I'd rather get catering, invite friends over, and enjoy the game at home!)\n\nSorry, not much of a review, I know.  Lots of parking, but walk with a friend or seek out security on bikes for safety.  Lackluster food options, but easily solved by eating elsewhere; help support local businesses!
