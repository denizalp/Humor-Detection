When I saw that this park had been designed and created within five days of this horrific tragedy, I knew I had to get here to pay my respects to the 58 victims who lost their lives.\n\nAs we arrived for First Friday, we made our way over to view the park first. Workers were still busy sweeping and washing the bricks. The first thing I noticed was the Tree of Life planted within a heart shaped garden. Behind that stands the Rembrance Wall. The wall holds pictures and mementos of the 58 victims. I got emotional just viewing this wall. There are 58 trees planted that represent their lives all around the park. Be sure to walk all around this park and take in the beauty.\n\nWe were lucky to participate in last night's events. We were asked to paint a tile with a message of hope or whatever was in our hearts by the Boy Scouts of America. These tiles will be laid within the park for all to view. There were many people participating and all ages were included. Everyone was so kind and helpful to one another and I found the experience to be very cathartic.\n\nI am grateful to Mayor Goodman, City of Las Vegas, and all the companies and volunteers that willingly donated their time and materials to create this park so quickly. As Mayor Goodman stated in her ribbon cutting speech last night - \"Be sure to look up in the sky tonight as 58 new stars are shining bright\" \n\nTake time to stop by and just sit and enjoy this beautiful place. We will never forget these victims and we will always honor each one in our hearts.
