¿Dónde es la peda?\n\nOver effing here.  I've only been here a few times but I love it!  I've had their quesadilla paquime, a few bites of my friend's ribeye tacos, their tortas cubana, and some other bites here and there.  Everything I've had here has always been fresh and flavorful and the portions are decent for their price.  As for their horchata... delicious and refreshing!\n\nTortas Paquime is a casual dining spot that's always busy.  Don't forget to make a stop at their salsa bar.  They also have huge cases of baked pastries and a very impressive ice cream bar.  I have yet to try their sweets but they look pretty damn amazing.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and there's ample parking all around.  Thumbs up for yummy tortas!  ¡A huevo!
