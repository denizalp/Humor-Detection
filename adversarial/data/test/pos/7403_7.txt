After deciding I wanted to see a Psychic, I went online to search for places  somewhat close to where I live. I found Crystal Vision on the yelp site and decided that this would be the place I would try out. I am glad I decided this. I called and made an appointment to ensure a spot and headed over. When I arrived, I was a bit nervous but mostly excited. The location is great and easy to find (with lots of bike parking for those of us who bike everywhere!)\nThe decor is soothing and makes for a relaxed atmosphere, not intimidating or anything. Crystal is very warm and welcoming, and gave me a brief of what Chakras were so I would understand when she explained what she saw from me.\nWithout going into the details of my reading, I will tell you I am very happy I made the decision to see her, she not only explained things to me that no one else would ever know, but she helped me to understand and overcome certain things in my life I was struggling with. If you want to go for a fun reading then she is the one to go to, but if you are in need of more, she is absolutely the person I would recommend.
