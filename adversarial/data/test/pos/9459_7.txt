I finally decided to stop by Pastry Palace to use the Groupon that I had purchased a while ago. It was $10 for $20 worth of pastries. \n\nWhen I walked in, the employee who was working in the front was sitting down and eating with a friend. But he got up and greeted me as soon as I reached the front counter. I told him that I wanted to use my Groupon. He acknowledged it, but wasn't exactly friendly about it. He was probably irritated that he had to \"work\" when he wanted to spend time with his buddy. \n\nI was able to pick out 7 different pastries and paid $1.00 extra since they were $3.00 each. As I was down to picking my last two items, the employee suggested that their Eclairs were pretty popular. I couldn't figure out if he was really trying to provide customer service, or if he was trying to get me out of there because he thought I was taking too long? Although I would say that I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes! I took his suggestion anyway and it turned out that their Chocolate Éclair was pretty good.\n\nI didn't feel like their pastries were anything special. In addition to the Chocolate Éclair, I did like their Cannoli. However, the Chocolate Cupcake was too dry and the Tiramisu was too soggy, so I threw those away after taking two bites. The others I had, which were the Cream Horn, Cheesecake, and the Chocolate Moose tasted alright, but nothing special. \n\nWould I come back? Maybe if I needed to order a custom cake, otherwise, probably not.
