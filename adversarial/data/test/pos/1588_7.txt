On the plus side, Condado has late hours and really good food. You can choose from a list of tasty options or build your own. \n\nThe decor is very cool, they let a creative artist go wild with cartoon inspired wall murals. \n\nI loved the European style billing, your credit card never leaves your sight, and you pay at your table on the spot. \n\nBut what about the annoyingly over-cool music? I'm glad I'm not the only reviewer to mention it, because it's much too difficult to have a simple conversation.
