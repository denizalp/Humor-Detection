I definitely agree with the previous Yelper, this place does have irresponsible customer service. I bought 2 Groupons a while back for the keratin treatment and used one in November (pretty good results with the treatment, although the service provider was late for my appointment). I had an additional Groupon that had expired in May and was told on the phone that I could use the value ($89) towards any good or service in the store. So, I scheduled a double process color for this morning (value- $80). When I arrived, I was told that I could not use the voucher for anything other than the keratin treatment and that if I chose to have another treatment, I would have to pay an additional $45. Such BS! \n\nUpon reading the 'fine print' on the Groupon, I pointed out that it clearly states that you can use the amount of the voucher for any good or service, I was pretty much told TFB. The owner\/service provider didn't offer to do anything else for me, just opened the door and sent me on my way. \n\nI have since sent her a copy of my voucher with the fine print highlighted. I have called Groupon and they are going to give me my money back, since the owner also refused to give it back to me on her end.\n\nA word of caution...if you still choose to go to this salon, don't buy or try to use a Groupon or Living Social deal and don't expect good customer service.
