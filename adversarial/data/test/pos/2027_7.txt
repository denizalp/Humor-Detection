What a joke of an operation. \nParty of 8 had a 1 hr 'chase'. $265 a piece is $2000. \n\nOur noon shuttle arrives at 12:20. \nArrive at Sun Buggy around 12:40 to total disorganization, no flow, little communication. Bad sign. \n\nGet shuttle to desert where we stand around  until 2:15. No communication. Obviously they're quite far behind. Not enough buggies. \n\n2:30 we begin our 'chase', which is a casual ride of 5 minutes when 1 buggy stops. Now we have to wait. The guide returns, starts the engine. We are off. For a minute, then my buggy stops. He comes back. And we're off. For another minute. Then mine stops. Won't start. Flat tire. And the guide sees we have a bad spark plug. It's now 3pm, we have literally ridden 5 minutes. \nOur guide says we are going back to switch out the buggy. \nSo we go back. \nNow we are told to get out...and the next group gets in our buggies that one we point out is covered in splattered oil (\"ehh no big deal\") \nAt this point obviously the whole thing is a wash. We did nothing except ride out and watch our buggies get fixed. \n'Uhhhh so was that the ride?'\n'Oh no. We haven't even started yet'\n'Well we have stuff to do, we can't be waiting around all day for you guys to get your shit together.'\n'Yeah sorry we overbooked. I'd go back if I were you, it'll be awhile'\n\nWow. \n\nGreat day of dune buggy riding. This is where it gets fun \n\nWe go back after being told the message will be relayed what happened and we will be taken care of and not to worry. \n\nThe woman there says she heard we only got a half hr of the hr and if was rough so she is doing is a favor and giving us...25% off...of $265...for zero minutes of chase time and 10 minutes of buggy fix time. \n\n'No that's not right. We never started. And we definitely were not riding for a half hr. Ask the guide' \n\n'Yeah we are giving you 25% off and firing the guide' \n\n'No no no. This is not how you do customer service. We want to speak to the owner'. \n\nAs we got the run around on where the owner was it escalated as this woman was going out of her way to be rude and dismissive. Once again, not how you treat customers who paid good $$ for an experience you advertise. \n\nIt got to the point where after she refused to refund us for a complete waste of a trip to a desert for buggy mechanic class I started telling all the new customers about our experience. They were eager to listen. \n\nThe employees at sun buggy all disappeared behind the counter to hide from the visibly upset customers. Very professional I must say for a business to act. \n\nFinally after still not listening to reason, we said 'fine we will take this up w our credit card companies. Now take us back to the hotel.'\n\nNo \n\nNo?\n\nAre you kidding me? You do all the other stuff and now this? That's unbelievable. Isn't that part of the contract?\n\n'Its complimentary'\n\n'Ohhhhh hahaha. Complimentary!! That's great!! I'll make sure to tell everyone in yelp and social media about you people and your operation' \n\n'Go for it, we don't care' said the woman. \n\nSo I proceeded to tell even more customers about our wonderful time getting ripped off. That's when they decided to happily give us a ride all the sudden away and back to our hotel. The driver sat in complete silence, obviously embarrassed, as we all were on the phone immediately w our credit card companies. \n\nDespite its good reviews I've seen other posts in here w them screwing over customers. Last I heard the owner talked to one in our party and said we would get 75% off and a credit for a future use. \n\n- 75%? You're kidding me right? What did I pay for exactly? \n2-you treat me like that and invite me to come back for more after you STILL don't refund my money entirely. Nice scam. You saw $2000 and figured you could at least get $500 from that and keep people happy and cram more folks in your buggies? Nice try. \n\nWe shall see what happens. If this is how they treat people, I can only imagine how they would function if God forbid someone got hurt. Ouch. Lawsuit.\n\n2 days later--So they happily charged us the full amount of $265 for literally 0 chase minutes. Quite a change from 25% off to 75% off to 0% off. Guess it's off to the credit card companies and better business bureau.\n\n25 days later- now charged $65 and I'm told I should be satisfied I'm getting a free credit. Not ripping me off $65 would satisfy me a tad more. So I'm Letting the credit card company deal w it. \n\nFunny, when this all went down I told the person in charge I'll be sure to let everyone on yelp and social media know. The sarcastic response 'go ahead we don't care'. Ok, game on. You wanted this.
