Thump, Thump, Thump....yea, the persistent bass pumping from this classy adult mating environment is mixed perfectly with the gorgeous bodies parading and nectar of the Gods being served.  Blue Martini is a great hot-spot for those wanting to be \"seen.\"  \n\nIt's a great place to go after work with friends and coworkers. If you go with a group, plan on arriving early.  At least you can get some tables...always in short supply later on in the evening...and if you get there early enough there is no cover.
