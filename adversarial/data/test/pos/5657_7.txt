Anyone who doesn't love donuts is a liar (j\/k). We love stopping by Dunkin Donuts sometime during our trip to Las Vegas and we've come to this location before since it's right next to the outlets.\n\nThis location also has a drive-thru option, but we prefer to go in and pick out donuts. During our last visit, service was slow because of a few problems: drive-thru, the register, and even using their newly launched DD app. \n\nAfter all the donut dilemmas, we were still able to use the app and newly purchased gift card on our in store purchase. They even let us redeem some of the app promos.\n\nFYI - the munchkins (donut holes) are our favorite when we go home. They come in glazed, powdered, and chocolate cake (maybe there are more?).\n\nOne more year until Dunkin Donuts will be back and popping up all over California!! =D\n\n\nYelp 100 Challenge 2014 - 18 of 100
