The decor is wonderfully reminiscent of any of the delis I have been to in NY.  However, the menu is extremely limited.  I had salami and my daughter had smoked meat.  The salami was as I would expect.  The smoked meat was VERY fatty.  The waiter was going on and on about how different it was from any other smoked meat I had eaten.  Not particularly!  It tasted basically like any other meat I have had.  Not horrible, but certainly not amazing!  I definitely would not go out of my way to visit this restaurant again when visiting Montreal.  I have had far better meat, at a much lower price.  And I see no point in going to a deli where my choices are so limited.  Also, the parking situation near the deli is impossible.
