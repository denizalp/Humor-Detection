I came here for a late dinner with the love. I haven't been over here since it used to be iguana macks. \n\nTo start I ordered the peachitini. The martini was delicious and very tasteful. For dinner I was very torn between the Mac and cheese and their pizza. I ended up ordering the Mac and cheese and added chicken to it. This was extremely delicious and very cheesy. They did a really good job on it. The only downside was it was extremely spicy for me! I don't remember it saying spicy on the menu so I wasn't warned about this. Lol. It's one of those things where you want to keep eating it though because it was so good. \n\nAnother plus is you get a glass of beer that is included as a side when you get an entree. Very good idea social box. \n\nThe customer service was really good. The only thing I recommend is dimming the lights a little but. It was extremely bright in the restaurant. I definitely want to come back to try their brick oven pizzas!!
