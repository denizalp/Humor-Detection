Location: 2104 Highway 7 W\nPrice: $$\nService: Super\n\nThis is honestly my favourite breakfast diner in my area. The service is great and the servers are super friendly. It is a smaller diner and definitely a gem in the area. The food is good and I LOVE their homefries! The portions are decent and they have an early bird special from 6am-11am ($5.99 if I remember correctly). Their prices are reasonable and I would like to come back for their sandwiches or burgers. \n\nVerdict: Go for brunch
