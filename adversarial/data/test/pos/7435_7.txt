Maybe if I did a little research first on what the storyline is all about, I would've appreciate the KA more...\n\nThe performers were really great. The maid in the story is really funny. The acrobatics and puppetry was nice. \n\nStage rotates in all directions which makes this show unique. That being said, seating further away from the stage is highly suggested. All seats in the house gives you full view.\n\nThis is a nice show, but it's not worth a second time!
