I have never been more east than this, other than when driving on the 401 to get the fuck out of the city for a weekend. This is about as far as you can go along Queen Street East before Scarborough. \n\nMy meal was absolutely five stars. If you can avoid the server that I had on my first visit (embarrassingly, I think it was the owner), it's well worth the trek to The Beach(es). Before dinner make sure you get a cupcake at Life Is Sweet: A Cupcake House (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/life-is-sweet-a-cupcake-house-toronto#hrid:9TAPc-LI-PW-1Ccn1XLrWg) across the street, cause they close early. Best cupcake in the city.\n\nANYHOODLE.\n\nI read about this place on a Chowhound thread called \"I Defy You To Name Me A Single Decent Restaurant Worth Travelling To The Beaches For\" (or something to that effect). It was one of the only places that seemed quasi-appealing after reading through all the comments. We made a reservation for two people without any trouble and trekked east to check it out. Yelper shoutout: spotted Abby R there on the same night! The restaurant is very poorly lit - like, beyond \"Can't-Read-Your-Menu\" dark and graduated to \"Can't-Take-A-Decent-Photo-For-Yelp\" dark. I couldn't take an adequate photo of the interior or exterior.\n\nAs for the food: \nButternut Squash Soup ($4). Bacon wasn't listed on the menu, but the otherwise vegetarian soup came with bits of it as a garnish. I returned the soup to the kitchen (with much difficulty) and got Grana Padano as a garnish instead. Very, very velvety and rich - I would definitely order this again. \n\nAngry Salmon ($16). This was incredible. Just absolutely perfect. I want to eat this again RIGHT NOW. The portion of fish was ENORMOUS - I hungrily mowed through half of the meal and there was enough left over for the next day's dinner. The fish fillets were seasoned with a zesty cajun spice rub (HOT!) and cooked properly throughout. This was all on top of a bed of spaghetti in cream sauce with artichokes, baby spinach and tomatoes. The sauce was...every clich√©d adjective used to describe delicious food. I fell in love with it.\n\nI don't want to harp too much on the service but this was one of the few times I have left absolutely no tip. The service was awful. There wasn't any particularly egregious exchange that night, but the server (the owner or manager) was inattentive, forgetful and well...just not good at her job. I endured a bit of ball-busting about the unadvertised bacon in the soup, we had to ask for water three separate times (to the point that we had stop eating because we couldn't swallow any more food without fluids), and the only visits she made to our table were for the delivery of food and the bill.\n\nI get that the dining room was full\/busy but it was a weeknight and it seemed to be the norm for Vivetha from what I read in other testimonials. Perhaps she was having a bad day but honestly, it was a real turnoff. Luckily the food was excellent enough for me to want to come back...I'm just not rushing to do so. I really hope this was an anomaly because it was a terrible first impression to make.\n\nReservations are highly recommended.
