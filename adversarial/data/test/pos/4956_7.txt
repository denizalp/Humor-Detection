Overall, I wasn't very impressed with Black & Blue. I went for lunch recently with three co-workers. When we arrived, the place was empty except for one couple sitting outside. Since it was a nice day, we decided to sit outside as well. Our waiter seemed nice enough, bringing us water and taking our drink order. As for entrees, three of us ordered three different burgers and one co-worker ordered pasta. Since the place was dead, I thought our food would arrive quickly... but it didn't. While we waited, the couple next to us sent their food back and complained about their drinks (cocktails at lunch). The waiter apologized and offered a redo but the couple just grumbled instead. Nothing was really resolved, but it left me a little uncomfortable as the couple kept grumbling the rest of lunch while the waiter tried to make up for it. \n\nEventually, our plates arrived. Everyone ordered their burgers medium rare and all were served medium to well. My burger, the Ale House Burger, had caramelized onions, bacon jam, fontina cheese, and garlic aioli. In theory, it sounded delicious. However the bacon jam was awful. I did not enjoy my burger. My two co-workers ordered the All American and the Hatch Chili. The All American was standard - cheddar with bacon. Nothing special. I was told the Hatch Chili was good but overcooked. As for the pasta dish, the Southwest Alfredo Pasta, my coworker thought it was good. It looked pretty appetizing and a rather large portion for lunch. \n\nWe asked the check be split into two upfront, but when the check came, the waiter was slightly confused. It was probably because he was so focused on trying to make the other couple happy that he forgot about us. Thus, we waited around for another 10 minutes while he figured it out. We finally paid and were on our way. Overall, I was not impressed with my burger and the entire atmosphere\/vibe was just off. I doubt I'll be back.
