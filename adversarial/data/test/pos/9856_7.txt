My Parents and I dined here following my Father's release from the hospital.  They ordered the Pepper Beef entre served on rice.  A very generous helping and delicious.  I had the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas, which were not only flavorful and spicey, but also a very colorful presentation.  Not at all what you would expect for hospital food.  A large salad bar, gourmet coffees and Dreyers soft-serve ice cream for dessert!  You won't be disappointed.
