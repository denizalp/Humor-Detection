How best buy manages to gather every annoying, ignorant, rude and brain-dead scrub in markham all working under one roof, I'll never know. Over the years, I've grown to absolutely HATE this best buy. The people that work here are so stupid and rude that I suspect they don't even actually work here- they were just lost customers with a blue shirt that was lost for so long in the store, they eventually became the workers. These workers.. I wouldn't even poke them with a stick from 10m away.. like, get as FAR away from me as possible. They're so uninterested in their job that they BARELY try to help you before returning back to their conversations with each other. Well, I'd be too if I was over 22 and worked here... \n\nThe workers always find a way to bug the crap out of you when you don't need help, but when you do, they're NOWHERE to be found. Every time I actually need help finding something or getting an item out of display, I always end up asking the 'wrong section' but \"don't worry. they'll help send the right guy soon enough\" ...... I've waited in one section for over 20 minutes before .... and when I had questions, I've gotten answers like \"I don't really know....\" WHO TRAINED YOU? DO YOU ACTUALLY WORK HERE?!?!? \n\nI came in today with my best friend because she wanted to get a life proof case for her vacation.. after finding one that fit her huge tablet-sized phone (aka iphone 6+), we asked if we can pay at the phone place since the regular line was super long. He said no but he said we can pay at the other checkout towards the mall entrance.. we walked there and the guy there was like \"No. Go to the checkout\" ... This place is so disorganized and disoriented. Customer service is a negative, just because you can barely find someone that actually works there with proper training on how to treat customers. Maybe best buy should pay their employees comission like future shop did, then they'd be more motivated in their job. Their employee motto at this best buy is probably \"don't interrupt me while I'm in the middle of nothing.\"
