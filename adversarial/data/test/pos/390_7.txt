I love this place.... A little expensive then other groceries but the place is huge and clean. What I love about this place is their cake collection as they have a bakery section and they make cakes everyday. There are different sizes and they write anything you like, if their is no space they write it on a ribbon. Their other bakery stuff is good as well such as croissants. \n\n\nThe Bakery staff is great and have good writing skills. There is plenty of parking in front entrance and back entrance. There is a coffee shop, flower shop and a candy shop inside the store.
