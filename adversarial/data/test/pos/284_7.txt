Anytime I've been to Baby Huey's I've had a good time. Plus I am pretty sure they might be named after the late soul-singer, which would be pretty dope of them. They have lots of good beers on tap and the prices are relatively cheap. The music varies depending on whoever is DJ-ing that night, so it can range from great hip-hop and funk to terrible electro or questionable rock. Sound system is weak so amateur DJs can make your ears bleed.\n\nThe spot is very small, but that's part of the appeal. If you're lucky enough to score a couch in the back then you can have a nice little house party feel with your friends. Last time I went they were working on a patio but I'm not sure if it ever worked out given the noise complaints on Ossington.
