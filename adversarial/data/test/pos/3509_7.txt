This place was horrible, it reminded me of McCarthys back in the day. I went because my buddy is recently single and for some reason felt it necessary to attend this wretched creation of a bar. The door man was draped up in a skin tight security shirt and a cowboy hat, wtf?!\n\nI really have no more to say, stay away!
