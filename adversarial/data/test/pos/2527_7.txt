Read the previous reviews from everyone else and DO NOT BOOK HERE!!!!! Your life expectancy could be cut short.\n\nIs it even legal to call this place a hotel??!! I don't think so. What can I say that hasn't been said in the previous reviews.  Pictures on the website make it look super nice. When you get here, it's a totally different story. Let's start off with the front desk. They could really use a course in hospitality. You walk into your room, and the first thing you will notice is the overwhelming smell of cigarettes wafting into your nostrils. Immediately, I was already unhappy about this. Supposedly, all the rooms here are \"non-smoking.\" I tried to get anohther room, but had no luck. Within minutes, I had started getting a headache and nausea. Good thing my girlfriend I has plans to be out most of the night so we wouldn't deal with it. By the time we got back to our room, we were just completely miserable. You would think that you would get used to it, but nope! No amount of candles or perfume and cover the smell of filth in that room . So at 3am of our very first night, we booked a room somewhere else on the strip. \n\nGoodbye Rumor Boutique Resort. Maybe you will see my bills for my medical expenses resulting from my stay there.
