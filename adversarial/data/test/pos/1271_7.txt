Stopped by Luisa's for their lunch pizza deal and was pleased. While it's not great pizza, it is absolutely very good pizza. Brick oven baked, rather than the usual gas oven stuff, it is a bit more charred around the edges and this adds a different flavor - a good one - to the pie.\n\nThe buffet has a salad which is nice and tasty, but don't decieve yourself into thinking that's a healthier choice than the pizza. It's got a good amaount of dressing on it. And really, you're at a pizza place. Have the pizza!\n\nAnd for the pizza choices, it was a nice variety though not spectacular. The focus here is on the tasty crust and not the creative toppings. What are you expecting for $9? Pepperoni and sausage and peppers and mushrooms and the like. The pesto-topped pizza was tasty.\n\nA very nice lunch option at a great lunch price for very tasty brick-oven pizza. I can see why Luisa's is so popular!
