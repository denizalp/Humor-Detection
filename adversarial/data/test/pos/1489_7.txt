I've been a big fan of Bubba Gump's ever since I was introduced to their location in San Francisco and ate there a few times. So when my hubby brought me to Las Vegas for our first wedding Anniversary, and for my first time ever in Las Vegas, we debated a TON on what to have for dinner. As we ventured out on our night which he had decided on walking around and eating to wherever calls us...he said...\"Hey, there's a Bubba Gump's here!\" I look over to see he's on Yelp! \nI said, \"You know what, I could go for some Gump's!\" And away we went!\nThe line was non existent and the restaurant had some open tables. We were behind a larger group, both of us asking for outdoor seating... Without asking if we wanted to wait, we were immediately sat in the dining room while the larger group was taken outside. When we arrived at our table I asked the host, \"Um, was there no seats outside?\" \nHe said \"There's a ten minute wait.\" \nOk whatever... We just took the booth. \nOur waitress came quickly and was great the entire night! My hubby ordered the Burger and I ordered the bucket of seafood at Market Price. Food came fast and my bucket of seafood was amazing and so was the extra garlic bread we ordered. We love this place so I know we'll be back.
