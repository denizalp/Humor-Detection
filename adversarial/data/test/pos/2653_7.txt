Yes, this place is yummy.  I looove the squash\/potato\/chickpea combination.  But those who claim this is the best roti in Toronto have certainly not tried Island Foods... mmm..now that's a roti.  The roti bread here can be a bit on the dry side. At Island Foods, the juice drips all the way down to your elbows.\n\n$8 for a roti. Not the cheapest but when you see how big they are it justifies the price.
