Fez is the one restaurant I expected to be treated better at.  I went there one June evening with a gay friend.  I was dressed in a skimpy but fun costume (if a bit over the top), as I was on my way to some parties later on.  After all, those of you that know me know this is how I roll.  It's certainly legal, and the leather shorts are very short.  Yet Fez refused to serve me.  I was summarily ejected hardly a minute after I set foot in the joint.  This is the same costume that has passed muster at many other locations, including the light rail and many other bars and restaurants, but not Fez.     \n\nNow, that being said, on past trips, the food has been good, but any place that would do such a thing canot receive a maximum recommendation.  I'm partial to the cinnamon\/cumin soup, but I won't be dining here again voluntarily.  I'll take my restaurant business to Ticoz or Roscoe's on 7th if I need to eat out.
