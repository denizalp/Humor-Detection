I was estatic  to try this place out. A new organic\/vegetarin\/vegan\/ HEALTHY restaurant in Phoenix is this girls dream come true! \nFirst of all, I loved the decor and ambiance. Put wheat grass plants in any restaurant and I love it! \nI had the harvest salad to start and I must say I want to go back every day just for this. Goat cheese, apples, walnuts, butternut squash and pomegrant-lious! I had the teriayki tofu for my main course. I wasn't as impressed. Teriyaki sauce is not my favorite but I was really craving the tofu, which was good tofu. You can actually substitute tofu for the meat in alot of the dishes, so I really liked that.\nThe drinks are definitely not the focal point of this place, as I did not care for the rye vodka they had (their only vodka). \nI will definitely be back again and again....
