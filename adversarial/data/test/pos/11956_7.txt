I know government employees are notorious for being angry and bitter, but the employees here really take it to the extreme. I can't think of a positive experience that I've had at this location. Unfortunately, I'm zoned to this office for certified letters and my neighborhood mailbox. \n\nLet's start at the beginning. When we bought our house we wanted our mailbox lock change so we entered our request....and nothing. At the time my husband and I were both working about 60 hours a week and not near this office so we had to let it go. We just didn't have time to follow up on the lack of response from lazy government employees on top of jobs and all of the work that comes with a new (existing) home. Fast forward to months later and I came home to find that my key no longer worked in my box. We made the inconvenient trip to the post office to find that the once lost request was found and processed. What?? \n\nI also had a certified letter fiasco with this office. I won't get into detail since this is already getting lengthy. The few times I've come here to mail items I've regretted it. The long line does not move fast here. I stand in the same spot for an unacceptable amount of time. At least the line at the location on Sunset near the airport moves. Then when I get to the counter I get a crabby, angry worker....even by post office standards they are bitter humans. Good luck getting anyone to come to the window with the buzzer. Signs direct you there for certain requests and then nobody comes to the window. \n\nIt's not all doom and gloom here. The parking lot is huge and I've never had a problem finding parking. The location is easy to access from Horizon Ridge. The lobby also stays open after hours so that flat rate boxes and the free shipping supplies are available at all hours.
