Vegetarians beware! Ye are entering into a land where meat is king, veggies are flavorless and hummus is bland and overbearing.\n\nIf you eat meat, then I'm sure Togo's is fine. Perhaps great. I don't know. \n\nBut I don't eat meat, thus making Togo's hell in a sandwich shop for me. They have only a couple options for vegetarians, one being the hummus sandwich. Never get it. It's sick. \n\nI guess if you don't know what good hummus tastes like, then maybe you would like this sandwich.  But I hated it.  They spread it waaay too thick and then added a few bland veggies and that was that.  I suppose you could do a make-your-own veggie sandwich, but they're not all created equal and I would have to venture that anything without meat at this place just isn't going to be tasty.\n\nVegetarians of the world, eat somewhere else.
