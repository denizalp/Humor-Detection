I certainly can't complain here! Relatively comfortable barstools, pub-like interior, and a great location. \n\nIn an effort to curb my hangry-ness, we stopped into Kettle Black for what I was thinking would be fish and chips, because I sometimes judge a book by its cover. We took a seat over at the bar and chatted with the bartender a bit. Turns out they were amidst happy hour and my fish and chips fell by the wayside for the highly recommended Philly cheesesteak fries. Super filling and really tasty. We got them with a side of hot sauce, which was definitely the way to go.
