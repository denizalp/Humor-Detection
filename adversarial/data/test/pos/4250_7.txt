5 Stars. I know, that's basically saying there was no room for improvement. How can that be? There's always room for improvement.\nBut not this time.\nC & I walked in & were pleasantly greeted by Brandon. I ordered our usual In n Out fare; 2 Cheeseburgers, 1 Fries & 2 drinks. C ALWAYS gets the same Cheeseburger. Nothing on it except extra extra extra extra pickles. That's right, 4 extras. Brandon asked C if he really likes pickles & of course the answer was \"yes\". So Brandon said he would add a side of pickles. Oh yaaa!\nI got my Cheeseburger with grilled onions and mustard instead of spread. When I picked up the burgers C could not believe how much Brandon had hooked him up. First, there was a side of pickles, 19 pickles in a burger wrapper. Then there was his Cheeseburger. 17 pickles. Winner winner dill pickle dinner. So far, in C's 9 years and many many fast food cheeseburgers, the most pickles C ever got was 36. That was from Chris at the In n Out by Chandler Fashion Center. So this was EPIC!\nBoth our burgers were great. The fries were yummy. The dining room was clean & being cleaned while we ate by an employee wiping down the tables and sweeping the floor. Nice. The condiment bar was also clean as was the drink station.\nGreat customer service, great Cheeseburgers, clean environment, fair prices. 5 Stars.
