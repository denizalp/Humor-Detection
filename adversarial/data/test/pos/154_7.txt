I slowly backed my ass out of Crown Prince Fine Dining & Banquet as soon as I realized my net asset near my rear asset only had a $5.00 paper currency.  ABC Bakery a few doors down sounded more within my current Net Present Value so I went in more confidently.\n\nChinese Bakery also doing HK Cafe food.  Not exactly the biggest selection of Baked Breads or Pastries but enough on offer for the blue\/white collars working nearby.  Standard priced Noodle\/Rice dishes on offer.   2.5 *Star*\n\nEgg Tart & Milk Tea($2.10)\n\nFresh still warm-from-oven Egg Tart was flakey however it was the DENSE flakey variety rather than airy.  Not sure if it's due to the warm status of the Egg Tart but the custard within had pockets of separation which looked less appealing but I didn't taste any difference.  Milk Tea was quite nice and enjoyable.  Best part was getting the $2.90 in coins back in my pocket.\n\nThe environment atmosphere was a bit awkward.  The customers were either single individuals or even when in multiples they were freaky quiet compare to any HK Bakery Cafes.  That combined with no focal point of either Televsion\/Radio or decor made this place feel stale\/boring\/depressing!  A spot where you eat, mind your own business and \"clap flies\".
