We walked into this place and were seated. As we sat down we noticed it was a Saturday night and every restaurant was busy but this one was almost empty. The next thing is the walls had spiderwebs and it was dirty. And not in vacuumed dirty but dirty. Sushi is one thing I'm not going to rush when it come to cleanliness. I have no idea what the food taste like nor will I in the condition it was in.. I would have given them no sushi rolls but it made me give them at least one....
