This place is huge and spacious, making it a perfect venue for large events as they serve food and drinks and it is very spread out......it has an upper level with pool tables and a bar but it's not as spacious but is perfect for people watching.  That being said, this place gets very hot as the crowds pile in.....I mean they were passing out fans and towels for goodness sake.......now I'm not sure if that is a problem with the cooling system or what but for a natural chic with a blowout these are unacceptable conditions and conditions my hair cannot withstand for an extended period of time.......definitely not a good look.
