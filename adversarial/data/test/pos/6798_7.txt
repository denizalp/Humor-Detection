Not very impressed. It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to pizza because I'm not the biggest pizza fan. I don't hate pizza, I just don't usually ever want it. I know that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnyhow, work bought us a bunch of pizzas from Angelina's so this was a great opportunity to try it all. And I never turn down free food, ever. I had the meatlover's, Meditteranean, white, and buffalo chicken pizzas.\n\nI listed them in the order in which I enjoyed most to least. So if the meatlover's was = just okay. Then the buffalo chicken was = wow, this is bad.\n\nThe white pizza was really plain looking and I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and not judge it for how it looks, but my eyes did not deceive my tastebuds with this one. \n\nOh well, at least I didn't spend any of my money on it.
