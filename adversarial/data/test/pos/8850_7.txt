3.5 for the food, 4.5 stars for the service. Overall, a pretty decent food court experience! As others have said, it's located in a basement food court (no windows, but pretty decent amount of seating), and you'll be greeted with: a) very friendly service, b) a good variety to the menu, and c) freshly made orders. \n\nFirst, location. We visited on a weekend and knew it would be a pseudo-mission to find this place. When you enter the building, head downstairs, walk straight till the very end of the hall, where you'll find a sign indicating \"Food Court\", pointing left. Head that direction and you'll find Kaiju in the food court you step into. \n\nSecond, the food. We purchased one order of the Chicken Katsu Curry, which came with rice and coleslaw. We actually thought the curry was the tastiest thing in our takeout box. Sweet but still with a kick, and so delicious mixed in with your rice! We thought the chicken itself was kind of rubbery (it seemed overcooked) but the exterior was nice and crunchy. Overall, decent, but not the best chicken katsu we've had.\n\nThird, the service. So sweet and friendly. The woman who served us would not stop smiling, and continually offered us water, drinks, cutlery, etc., to make our visit more comfortable. They care about their customers, and it shows.\n\nOverall, above-average food court experience, and we'll be back again if we're in the area. For one order of Chicken Katsu Curry (with rice and coleslaw), we paid around $10.00. Drinks were around $2.00 each.
