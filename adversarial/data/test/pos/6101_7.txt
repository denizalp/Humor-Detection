Ive had over 10 major cosmetic surgical procedures and countless fillers done over the years by several different cosmetic surgeons and this clinic has not disappointed me yet! \n I work in the same building and ventured in just to see the price list. After comparing over 6 clinics for laser hair removal, I was offered a much better deal at this clinic. Based on the beautiful, modern look of the clinic I was expecting a much higher price, so I signed up immediately. My results were slow but Alin made several suggestions to improve results, which worked!!  Alin knows her stuff, she has always been kind, patient and helpful when I have a million questions. Ive never felt pressured to purchase products\/services and Im always offered a deal to help me obtain the service I want to improve my look. All the staff are friendly and very helpful, I often pop in with a new question and they always take the time to help me.\nSeveral nurses in my office also go to this clinic, since we're also in the medical field, we have high expectations and know when we hear \"lip service\" so we're a tough crowd to please but we're all very happy so far...\nI have a Cutera Laser resurfacing, Botox and Juvaderm planned for the next month so I will be sure to keep you posted...\n***I was NOT paid, asked or bribed into writing this review, Im just a hard working woman that has to save money for this kind of stuff, and Ive been ripped off by many other clinics, had REALLY BAD injectable fillers (duck lips) so I want other ppl to be informed before they spend they're hard earned money on fraudulent clinics and services****\nHappy customer....\nLasynda E
