Holy f$&K. Are you kidding me with the Tamale?!?!?!? PEOPLE,(!) this food is good and legit. I'm from South Texas and very critical of Mexican food.  HIGHLY CRITICAL!!!!!  Good , cheap and VERY WELL DONE. \n\n3rd visit and jus more of the same PERFECTION. This place is NOT Tex-mex but would still make money there. Is jus had the red chili and not once did I need salsa and the blend of spices wow, jus wow. I am now going through my reviews for other places and taking stars away.
