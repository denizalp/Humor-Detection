This place has some great live entertainment...girls singing, guys rapping and pole dancers in the background. Awesome~!\n\nWhile waiting for our friends to arrive in Vegas...we chilled at Mandalay Bay at this bar. Ummm...we had a bit too much to drink...shots, beer, cranberry Goose. Yeah~! When our friends arrived we had more. Mainly Don Julio Anejo shots. Eeek~! Don't want that for awhile. As our intoxication progressed...the entertainment got better and better. They can really sing...those girls~!! The service was pretty good. I'd go back for the free entertainment...not for the Don Julio shots...
