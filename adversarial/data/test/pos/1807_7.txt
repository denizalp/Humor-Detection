It's the most unfortunate of days when something you love betrays you. I absolutely loved their pizza. Sauce was sweet and delicious. I always recommend them to people looking for a pizza. But today was dooms day. After a long day at work I didn't wanna do anything expect watch the walking dead and cuddle and binge on some pizza and wings. We waited close to an hour for the food to arrive which I didn't mind cause like I said, I loved them. Walking up the steps to my apt a roach crawls up and out of the pizza box. I swear on everything holy. So I call them and tell them and to my surprise they don't even argue it they tell me to come get my money back. So already fuming I drive downtown from south side and get stuck in traffic in the 10st tunnel. When I get there we simply received an \"I'm sorry\" and a refund. What? Is that really all you had to say? A roach crawled out of my pizza box! Needless to say I'm never eating there again. Traumatized. I took my refund and went to Luke Wholeys and that kicked butt! My review for that soon to come haha.
