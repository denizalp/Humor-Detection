I've been here for 5 months now, and so far so good! The location is amazing, very convenient, close to shopping, food, bars, and the lightrail! The property (at least the 7th ave side, havent really ventured over to the other end) is kept up well and always looks clean. I haven't had any issues with noise other than being able to hear every time the neighbors go up and down the stairs or open and close their front door, but that's to be expected with in an old building with thin walls. Maintenance has been very quick about coming up the few times I've needed them for some minor repairs. I was also very impressed at how quickly they were able to have a unit ready for me to move in to, things fell through with another apartment at the last minute and I needed a place in less than a week and they were able to have one cleaned and ready to go! The times I've dealt with management they have been super friendly and willing to work with me. Parking is unassigned, but that hasn't been an issue since there is plenty of parking spaces as well as street parking on Colter street. The fact that heating and cooling is included is a huge bonus, my electric bills are nearly nothing! The downside to that is that they control when the system switches from cooling to heating and then back from heating to cooling. The switch to heating came at a reasonable time, hopefully the switch to cooling is just as good! The bums that live in the park across the street were a bit of a concern to me at first since they can see every time I come and go from the apartment, but I havent experienced any trouble with them and now barely even notice that they are there. Overall, I'd say this is a decent place to live for the price and the location!
