OH SNAP!! \n\nI am not going to lie, my favorite food is sushi and I have gone to so many sushi bars including non-ayce AND ayce and this place has to be the BEST AYCE SUSHI I have ever had in 20+ years of my life. This is my REAL and HONEST review. It is so unfortunate that I cant express and write everything on here on Yelp. JUST COME AND TRY IT YOURSELF.\n\nWarning though, I think this restaurant is pretty new. You know what that means? The waiters and waitresses are soooooooo new and they are DEFINITELY not fully trained YET so they are freaking slowwwww. I mean REAL slow and even if you are trying to get their attention, they are caught up with whatever they are doing so wont give all their time to you, which is a bit upsetting.\n\nBut, let me talk about sushi now, after all, this place is AYCE sushi restaurant. OHEMGEE, the freshest fish ever!! Every piece I had at the day of my visit, had AWESOME flavor, cut and presentation. I was very very impressed. One thing that I really admired about this sushi bar was that they cut the fish after they get your order. Why is that surprising? Well, many of AYCE places have cut their fish in advance so that they can make sushi a lot faster to serve a big mass of people. I guess it is convenient for them but its not necessarily good for us. Fish can get dry and the taste will definitely be different. I dont know if that played a big role but my sushi tasted GREAT! I loved it and I ate so much.  Their hamachi was seriously the best I have ever had at any AYCE places. To top that hamachi, their AMAEBI WAS BOMB. I seriously have NEVER seen this AMAEBI QUALITY ANYWHERE (AYCE) before. Period. It was HUGE, MEATY and SWEET! I dont remember every one of them but everything I tried was so good. Their special for the night included Salmon Belly and DEAR, it was fatty and it just melted in my mouth. I love SALMON and it was just PERFECT.\n\nNow shifting to the appetizers, I only tried one, Coconut shrimp tempura and I am soooo glad I ordered that because it was amazingly good. The sushi chef actually recommended it and I absolutely devoured it. In fact, I ordered twice!! I really like that they come out warm and super crispy, fresh out of the fryer. Again, not many places do this. They usually have a lot of them fried, and just kind of give it to us, semi-warm and it is never crispy. Batter was ultra thin and shrimp was large. There were just the right amount of coconut on the outside batter, and it was just sooooo good!\n\nThey have honey bread as one of the options in the desserts, which is very rare to find elsewhere. It was pretty good but please order it without the ice cream, whip cream and chocolate drizzle. I only like to eat the honey bread. It was crusty and tasted good. It would have been a lot better if I knew it was coming out like that with all the extra that I dont care about.\n\nTo make things short, you will never find this quality at any other AYCE restaurants. They are at their best right now especially since they just opened. I hope they keep it the same and never downgrade. I will definitely come back whenever I am coming back to Vegas! You locals are lucky to have AYCE places like Sushi Way
