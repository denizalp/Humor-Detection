This is going to sound douchy, but: it's not as good as New York!\n\nThat said, the falafel sandwich was really good and the white sauce was just as good as I remember it. The hot sauce is still quite hot, which sadly, is rare these days! The queue moved soooo very slow both times I have been here and the inside was in complete disarray: tables were a mess, the fountain pop area was sticky and full of napkins and the floors were a mess. \n\nI am sure that the kinks will be ironed out in time, but this is a good lunch\/quick dinner spot, the prices are definitely right, portion sizes are great and I am happy to see The Halal Guys come to our city!
