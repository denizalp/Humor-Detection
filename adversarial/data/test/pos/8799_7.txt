One sunny afternoon I needed to refuel during my shopping trip to Scottsdale Quarter. I walk by Zinburger all the time and decided to give it a try. I have been to the location at the Biltmore but only once a few years ago. I sat at the bar and looked over their menu. I have to point out that the menu is almost exclusively burgers, they have a few basic salads but this is not a place for the vegetarian in your friend group. \n\nI love a little spice so I ordered the El Diablo Burger. The patties are giant and the fire roasted jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, and chipotle mayo were like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I didn't think the burger was too spicy but it definitely had some heat. Because I have little to no self control I got a side of double truffle fries with aioli and I couldn't get enough! The portions ensured I had some of everything left over for lunch at work the next day, but of course I ate it later that night (remember the lack of self control I mentioned?). \n\nNext time I am craving a big juicy burger this will be my spot!
