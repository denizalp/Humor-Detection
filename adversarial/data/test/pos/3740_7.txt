We have passed this place on a weekly and I've debated about trying it out. 3 years later after passing it on a weekly...I made my attempt.\n\nAttempt fail. I walked in, I stood, I walked out.\nWhy? I absolutely could NOT handle the service, or lack of...the person in front of me was receiving. Now read here...I am not a sensitive person and can tolerate bad service. However, when the lady behind the counter looks uninterested, looks at you like you are an inconvenience to her life, doesn't verbally respond to you when you ask her something...scratches her hair...looks away...like...dude, I couldn't do it. I had to walk out.\n\nWhy? Well, first of all...if the service set me on fire and it wasn't even my turn, imagine when it becomes my turn. I highly doubt she'll go from being bothered to enthusiastic. I have a hard time 'donating' my money whether it is 4 or 5 bucks to a business that doesn't seem to care about their customers. The air and mood in this shop felt dead, stale, whatever you want to call it. \n\nIt could have been an 'off' day, but consistency is my thing. If I have to 'luck out' and hope to catch you on a good day...tells me there's no consistency and I'm not with it. \n\nBesides, I'm not that desperate for boba. I can wait. However, give it a try. Wouldn't want to refrain you from missing out on a potential boba go-to just because of the service. Perhaps you may catch them on a better day. \n\nEnjoy!
