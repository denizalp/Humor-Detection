The food is pretty good but good lord, the service is awful. It's as if no one has been trained in any way, shape, or form. There is a swarm of employees but they're inefficient. Drive Thru line wrapped around the lot, went inside to see a line wrapped around the dining room as well. \n\nSERVICE: Apparently a half-hour wait is the norm here. It's unnecessary, given that you can see the food being freshly prepared and waiting to be bagged. The polite lady on register (only two) was not familiar with the menu or the POS system and kept repeatedly looking at a paper menu, the overhead menu, and her screen in confusion. My order was not complicated, but it took five minutes for her to call over the manager, and another five for the manager to figure it out. Both repeatedly tried to upsell me on their featured combo, which had an extra piece of chicken, finally stating they didn't know how to add on the side I wanted without charging full price and the \"feature\" had an extra side included. $10 and change, not bad.\n\nFOOD: Three piece dark (leg\/thigh) combo with 2 grilled and one fried, sides of yucca and corn salad, plus an empanada and two sauces (guava and bbq). Sauces were forgotten, but chicken was flavorful enough not to need it.\nGrilled chicken is juicy and smothered in an herb marinade, but oddly rubbery as if it were steamed or not fully cooked. Fried was better than expected, cooked in a skillet rather than a fryer. Difficult to pick a favorite. \nYucca side was generously portioned but could use a sauce. Corn salad tasted good but was room temperature, unclear whether it's supposed to be heated or cold. \nBuffalo empanada exterior was flaky but had an off-putting artificial butter flavor. I liked the filling though, wasn't too spicy.\n\nI realize they're fairly new (open three weeks), but management really needs to step in and train the staff. As they expand and open other locations, they need to learn from this location and make the space larger or at the least plan for a better way to manage the parking lot traffic, as people were unable to back out of their spaces to leave due to the cars in line. I'd like to come back in to enjoy dine-in service, they use real plates and silverware.
