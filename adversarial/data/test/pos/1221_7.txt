If you had mentioned to me a few years ago that a group of friends were having brunch at a Vegan restaurant I would have found a reason to be busy that day.  One thing the friends I have made directly and indirectly through Yelp is I have yet to meet all the foods I like.  I chose a chickpea burger and it was good as was the cole slaw I had with it.  In our party of 10 we tried almost everything on the menu and every plate was clean at the end.  I think the only thing that fell short was the eggplant \"bacon\".  This restaurant only seats a few over 20 and our party of 10 was a bit rough for them to get the food out all at once but we were not in a hurry and they were very friendly.  They are also a bakery with pies and donuts and such. I would go back again.
