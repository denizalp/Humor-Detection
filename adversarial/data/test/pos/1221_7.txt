Wow, reminds me of Miami's hey days in the 80's. Great crowd, great music, great bartenders and OMG the best crispy pork bellies EVER!!!!\n\nThis is a chic bar\/restaurant that has great ambiance, and a hip attitude. The food, well I just ordered the pork Belly, and it's like catholic miracle food, as I am cured of all my evils. I could eat 100 of those. \n\nZulu is located just steps from old town Scottsdale and within easy walking distance from everything. \n\nI may become a regular.
