I have been going to Desert View Family Med. for many years and have had Dr. Ann Marie Padilla as my PCP.  She is the best...very caring, patient and always listens.  As for the staff there, I have never had any problems.  I have never waited more than 10 minutes to be seen...usually they call me within 5 minutes to take care of paperwork.  Everyone is very efficient and professional.  Today I saw Dr. Padilla's PA Vivian and she was great as well.
