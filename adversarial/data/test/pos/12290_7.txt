Absolutely terrible. I highly discourage others from living here. The front office staff is completely inept. Multiple times thy have delivered packages of mine (fedex or ups takes them to the office at times) to different tenant's apartments. A few of those times the package had already been opened. They constantly harangue you for violating their rules (we were forced to take down tactfully decorated curtains from our balcony...god forbid we have some privacy.) We have gotten notices that our trash service will be discontinued because we put the trash out at 5 pm and it should only be out starting at 6 pm. And what do we get for all this harassment? a patch of disgusting, west nile infested grass in brown patches in front of our apartment, broken lamps that aren't fixed for months at a time, an almost complete disappearance of guest parking spots so that our guests can go park in what is the equivalent of tucson and make their way through the maze to our apartment, and a monthly water fee....WHAT APARTMENT COMPLEX CHARGES ITS RESIDENTS FOR WATER?!! Especially one that charges so freaking much for everything. The majority of the time if I make a service request, the technician or whoever is sent will have a bad attitude and be completely rude. I offer these guys water an food for their time and I am only constantly met with a shitty  attitude...get over it guy, its your job, they pay you to do that. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Stay away.
