One big thing that I've noticed since my initial visit to this establishment is that the customer service has steadily declined.  Don't get me wrong, the food's great, but the people that work at this restaurant are the most miserable people I've ever met.  \n\nTo speak from a previous experience, the woman that waits tables is loud and obnoxious.  At one point, my friend ate her meal but left the vegetables on her plate as she didn't enjoy that particular vegetable (they rotate which veggie they serve on a nightly basis).  One of the perks of being a self sustaining adult is that if you don't want to eat something on your plate, you won't be sent to bed without dessert.  She noticed that there was food still on the plate, picked it up and loudly said, \"uh, you didn't touch your vegetables.  Is there something wrong with them?\"  Seriously, unless my friend is also your daughter, calm down! \n\nHonestly, I didn't expect anything different from last night as this has been the habit recently, but I can't believe we were actually given worse.  In all reality, I have to admit that I can't believe there was a worse to give, but if you can expect anything out of the staff of this restaurant, it's that they will let you know when they're in bad moods, take it out on the customers and make you feel as uncomfortable as possible in the process.\n\nFirst off, we didn't get our drink orders placed until we'd already been seated for ten minutes and the drinks tasted flat.  The problem was that we were barely checked on during our visit, so explaining that the drinks tasted horrible wasn't going to happen.\n\nSecond, my friend ordered a salad to start her meal off.  Let me explain, first, that to this restaurant, a salad consists of a plate of mixed lettuce with a chopped tomato and dressing.  When it was brought out to our table, the waiter acted like he was in such a rush that he just sorta threw it at my friend and left before it had even finished sliding across the table to her.  She took, maybe, two bites and didn't finish it.  Once again, nobody noticed or cared that it barely got touched.\n\nFinally, I wish I could circumvent my rant about their horrible customer service with how great our meal tasted, but we never actually received our meal.  We waited for forty five minutes in vain.  This restaurant was hardly busy and the main server was fiddling with the register for a good ten minutes before I got fed up and walked over to them to hand them my debit card so that we could at least pay for our drinks.  When I got up there and told that man that we wanted to leave, he responded with, \"are you sure?  Your food's ready.\"  HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?!  You've been standing in the same viewable spot for ten minutes!!  Has it been ready that entire time but fixing the register trumped your customers?!\n\nI won't be back.  With the rate of decline on their service, I shudder to think of what I'd be subjected to next, especially since I'm paying them for my meal and experience.  Honestly, who would actually continue to endure that kind of crap at their own monetary and time expense?  Not me.  Also, not the people that I associate with.  Solidarity, sister.
