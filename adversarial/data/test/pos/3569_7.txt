This was our first and last visit.  I ordered a club sandwich and asked for extra pickles and the waitress had to ask how much they will charge. Half a buck for one pickle spear... I'm not cheap but that's tacky nickel  and dime, oh I'm sorry half a buck. BS. Did I mention 25 min to get our meal when not that busy?
