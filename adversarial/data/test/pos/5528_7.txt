I read the optimistic Yelp reviews back in January 2012 and I booked my first cut\/color with Emily Claire.  It's August now and I've been in 8 times.  Each experience included good customer service, but color that lacked my liking...... and a couple times the front of my hair and nape of my neck turned BLUE!!  I kept coming back as long as I have due to the customer service.  However, at this point, I'm exhausted and DONE with being a lab rat for them.  I'm moving to another stylist.  If you have blonde hair- be VERY careful!
