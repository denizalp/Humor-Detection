Aw man. Really? Disappoint. Service was wildly slow, and considering there were fewer than ten tables of guests at any give point during the entire time we were there, yeah service was lacking. No excuses, this was the worst. Took us way too long to even be acknowledged by a server who never really greeted us. More of \"here's bread. what do you want. k. brb\" kind of service. There was also a busser who never said a word and a runner who more or less rolled his eyes when food hit the table. Really not great.\n\nAnd the food isn't doing it any favors either.\n\nWe started with the calamari, which is Italian for salty octopus parts (or at least from my experience here, it must be). The tentacles are always my favorite and they were overly crispy to the point of being burned. There wasn't much redeeming about it.\n\nThen after the salty sea, we split the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were the tiniest meatballs I've ever seen, and in comparison the ikea meatballs were WAY more juicy and meaty. So I mean, like, it's do-able, I just don't get why this restaurant couldn't keep up. C'mon guys, step your game up. Our server could not care less about us and I could not think less of the food. Just overall, avoid this. Not good.
