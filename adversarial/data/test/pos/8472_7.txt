Review is for the casino property.\n\nParis has certainly gone through some major changes over the years, and I like the direction its going on the culinary front.  Mon Ami Gabi offers a decent French menu with views of the Strip at ground level.  Or you can go high to the Eiffel Tower restaurant with a better view.\n\nThe promenade between between Bally's and Paris now has an upscale burger joint, dim sum, sushi\/sashimi, a bakery, and an excellent crepe stand.  They also have Italian (Martorano's), which looks like an intriguing place, with the chef\/owner looking a little like a cross between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson.\n\nThe gaming area itself was okay.  I had a very hard time spotting a $10 blackjack game with 3:2 payout on blackjacks, but finally found one.  \n\nConclusion: Paris is probably one of the better casinos for a casual place to eat.  There seems to be more lower table limits in Bally's and Treasure Island, at least for Blackjack.
