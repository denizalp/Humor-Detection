They're open bright and early and ready to serve breakfast at 6am!!  This local favorite has bee here forever.  My kids use to come here when they went BMS back in the day. You can always count on a good cooked to order breakfast or lunch.\n\nRecent visit I had the Belgian Waffle breakfast that included scrambled eggs w\/cheese and chose bacon for my choice of meat.  It took a lil long for the order to come out, but I didn't mind since I knew it was made to order.  Waffle was really good. I like the batter they used.  Texture was light and fluffy. Every bite with whip cream and fresh strawberries was yummy.\n\nI always found the owner Paul and his staff pleasant. I liked how they recently extended the space and added a dining area. Even with construction and orange cone zones constantly plaguing on the area on Pacific St, you can find a place to park.
