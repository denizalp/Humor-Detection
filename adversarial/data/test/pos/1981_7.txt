I ordered fig pear pizza - the same dish Chef Ramsey ordered. The food is impressively amazing. Fresh ingredients, natural spices and bold combination. You can tell Amy holds very high standard over her food. We were served by Sammie, he is polite and prompt.  This is our neighborhood restaurant. We will definitely revisit. \n\nI am very proud of this couple. Continue operating after so much hardship. They are hardworking people. Please leave them alone if you even didn't visit them once.
