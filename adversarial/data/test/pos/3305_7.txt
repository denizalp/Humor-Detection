This breaks my heart but after our experience tonight we will never be back to the Red Mountain Café. First let me say until the last three months my fiance' and I were frequent diners here (6 or more times for lunch a month and dinner 2-3 times a month) we liked the food and great prices. It was a favorite lunch spot for us and we overlooked the dated interior and less than stellar cleanliness in the front end of the restaurant. The awesome ladies who served us knew us by our first names and even our \"regular\" orders when we came. They made up for any negatives. In the last few months however everything has changed here. Service and food quality have gone completely downhill. When the \"Help Wanted\" notice for line cooks, dishwashers and other employee's was plastered in the middle of the entrance door when we arrived at about 6:00pm tonight we almost left and should have.\n\nTonight was the final disappointment. \n\nI'll keep this short...I tried something new and relied upon the menu that described the dish. My \"Pork Tenders\" dinner came out as an overcooked chewy frozen preformed pork patty. It was not an actual \"pork steak\" as described in the menu that was hand breaded and fried. The Mexican Corn side dish that came out with it was cold, the canned brown gravy was barely warm and almost congealed. The only edible thing on my plate ended up being my baked potato and although it was small I made that my entire meal.\n\nMy fiancé's Ground Sirloin Dinner was a bigger disappointment if that is even possible. He ordered the meat cooked Medium Well to Well. When it arrived it appeared alright on the outside however upon cutting into the serving the outer edges were medium and the center rare. Again our server never came back and finally since we were in the front of the restaurant I called the cashier\\hostess over 20 minutes later because I could finally get her attention and complained heartily sending the remainder of both meals back.\n\nThe cost of my meal was removed from our bill by the owner as it should have been. When the owner INSPECTED my fiance's half eaten meal he had the server come and tell us since he had eaten the outer somewhat cooked edge of the meat (out of hunger) that meal was \"half eaten\" and we would receive no compensation. No offer of a dessert on the house, or for something else to be prepared. We paid the remaining bill and we both left the restaurant hungry and stopped and got a sandwich on the way home. After previously finding hair in the salad served to us three months ago and other issues we will not return here again.\n\nWe found out our server was actually a line cook that had worked at the café for three years and he was in the dining room working as a server. God knows who knows who was actually cooking!  Since he never came back after he finally delivered our food we could not lodge a complaint early on or get drink refills but it would not have mattered. The owner obviously has lost control of his kitchen and food quality standards. The restaurant will go on serving mediocre food at best and will stay busy due to the \"Winter Visitor\\Senior\" regulars that come in during the winter months but after Easter when times get lean at this small café they will have to do with two less year round regulars who help carry them through the summer months. I am sad and angry all at the same time over our treatment this evening.
