Maryanne IS right. Same experience here. Lukewarm thinned out onion soup with Kraft Parmesan cheese!! French onion soup should be served with fresh grated Gruyere cheese slightly browned and melted. We asked for a Rose wine and he had only a Zinfandel: Beringer, the cheapest wine possible. This for a a 4 or 5 star rated restaurant? \nThe server\/busboy, all in one was not an asset to the restaurant. Fellow diners had the veal and the sole and we're happy with it. I was ok with my brook trout. The potatoes were very good. \nThe place and the menu need updates. \nIt was a disappointment overall. We live close by and wanted to find a great restaurant.
