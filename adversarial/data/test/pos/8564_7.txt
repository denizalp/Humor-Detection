I used to LOVE these sandwiches and I am sad to leave this review. Especially because we just moved close to a dilly. I am NOT joking, I bit in my sandwich to find a battery in there. I have a toddler and luckily it was not her sandwich - she could have swallowed it. It was take out so I drove back to the location,made the manager look at the sandwich.she admitted the battery belonged to one of her devices and issued a refund. But my trust as a customer in their kitchen is 0 now and I have not returned. The manager apologized but had a what ever attitude and I'm Truly disappointed
