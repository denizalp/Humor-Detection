We dropped in here on a Friday night. We arrived early in the evening and it was not packed like sardines yet. We were able to listen to some nice live music. The band on stage was good. We were able to listen to several sets before they went on break. \n\nThe drinks were good and we shared a few appetizers. The pricing was fair. Nothing outrageously priced.\n\nAs the night moved along this placed got packed. The staff was anticipating this and started moving chairs and tables. Mostly for what seemed like they were making room for standing room only. \n\nThe staff was primarily good looking woman in short shorts. And some of the bouncers were easy on the eyes. One thing that i noticed that the customer base seemed to be more male orientated on the night that we were here. Hmmm.. this place probably turns into a meat market as the time moves along in the evening. \n\nWe left and had to wind our way out of the crowd. One thing that I did notice that was interesting is that it seemed like people could smoke inside the bar? Not sure if this was because there was open air seating. However we could still smell the cigarette smoke. Which was strange since I am used to bars not allowing people to smoke.
