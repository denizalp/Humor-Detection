This place lives up to it's highly rated billing.  My wife says it's a classic Italian NY deli and the food is awesome.\n\nI had the grilled chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe (leaves) and it's very tasty.  The chicken breast is very moist and soaked in all of the flavors.  What a good deal at $9.99.\n\nMy mother in law had the linguine with clams, which was cooked al dente.  Not bad, a classic dish, big portion.  Another good deal at $14.99.\n\nMy wife had the pastrami sandwich, very lean meat but still moist and perfectly seasoned with a good peppery taste.  You won't ask \"where is the beef\" as the sandwich is huge.\n\nOrdered the garlic knots and rice balls as sides, as if we needed to eat more.  Both were excellent!  Goes well with the classic marinara sauce they provide.\n\nA great find, as I'm getting tired of the eating places on the Strip, getting too pricey.
