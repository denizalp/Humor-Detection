Boy oh boy!...What a BIG disappointment from the last time I visited a Church's. We went to the one in Chandler and ordered the 12 piece family dinner with a coupon I received in the mail for $16.99. It included 12 legs and thighs OR 12 tender strips, large mashed potatoes, large Cole slaw and 4 biscuits. Sounds like a good deal doesn't it?  Keep reading...First the chicken..The pieces were of decent size (bigger than KFC) but was absolutely flavorless..the meat AND the crust and really greasy. I got a bad stomach ache later. The large mashed potatoes is notably smaller now and has the gravy on top so the first 2 scoops get all the gravy. The Cole slaw is cut in larger chunks now than I remember and also markedly smaller in portion size. Now for the biscuits...way way smaller now, about the size of a golf ball and about 2 small bites is all you get. What a rip off even with the coupon included. I can only assume they are all like this now unfortunately. But on the brighter side I got a free stomach ache.  The total amount paid for all this pleasure with tax was $18.38. Since it was a to go order I asked for some paper plates and received small paper boats...like the kind made for french fries and some 3 inch flimsy toy like plastic sporks. I could only laugh at that point.  Last visit to Church's but I wish it wasn't!  Sad
