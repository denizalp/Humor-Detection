I went to Stingray with my girlfriend and her exact words were \"the sushi is shit and so is the service\"\nHer words sum it up perfectly.  The service was just bad.  Our waitress didn't get it at all.  It took 15 minutes to get our drinks (we were one of 5 tables) and we waited another 30 to get the sushi.  No apology, no mention about the wait.  \nThe sushi wasn't even good.  No better or fresher than the kind you get at Trader Joes.
