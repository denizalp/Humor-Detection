I've been hitting up a lot of these beauty supply-type stores lately, looking for some replacement attachment combs for my cheap-o Conair electric clipper set. Hey, it's hard to keep sideburns the right length with scissors.\n\nAnyway, not much luck at any places, including here: the problem is that only the expensive, \"pro\" electric hair trimmers sell replacement combs, and they're not all interchangeable. But Beauty Supply Outlet had two pluses. First, the cutest salesgirls (if any business is allowed to capitalize on such superficial things, it should be one like this). Second, they were upfront and warned me about getting the attachment made for the similar trimmer, as other people had apparently bought them before and complained. No bimbo entrapment here, folks.\n\nAs for the rest of the beauty stuff here (or anywhere else), I'm lacking the chromosome that qualifies me to make any judgement on such matters.
