Maybe it was our fault for coming here a month after being in Turkey. We were craving gyro and shish kebabs and heard and saw good things from here, so we made a reservation. We arrived before our reservation, but still had to wait 15 min over. The wait staff were very friendly, but the spaces seemed too tight for many to walk through at once. We started with the hummus, which was good. I would say pretty standard. I could decide a dish, so I got the lamb mix grill - Shish kebab,  Adana Kebab, Lamb Kofte kebab, Lamb Chop, and doner (gyro). The lamb chop was delicious, tender, flavorful, finger licking good. The kebabs, however, were all too dry and tough. Flavor seemed there, but the meat wasn't tender at all. I couldn't finish my plate. \nIt's neat they're BYOB, but there were a few rowdy tables.
