My neighbor told me about this place because he said he had friends who used them. I kind of wish I didn't take him here. To start the customer service was great. The woman who helped us with glasses and who dropped him back home to us was so sweet so my review has no bearing on her.\n\nMy little Archer a day after his neutering couldn't stop licking the area he was fixed. Also he was sleeping ALL DAY and his eye was leaking and heavy like he was favoring it.\n\nI took him to the vet and the vet said He has 104Â° temp and a respiratory infection. His lymph nodes are swollen. The vet also said they roughed up his surgery pretty bad. They gave him a shot of an anti-inflammatory, and they have to give him  antibiotics once a day for 3 weeks.\n\nHe was perfectly fine until we took him there to get fixed now he's so tired he's sleeping by the door all day. Vet doesn't want him out in the cold getting worse. I took him here to save money on free neutering and they were reviewed ok. Turns out the free surgery turned into a lot of vet bills. Luckily I would do anything for my cat but because of this I now have more bills.
