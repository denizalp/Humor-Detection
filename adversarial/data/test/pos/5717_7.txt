Wow, I'm having a bad Dan dan day today!! \n\nAfter leaving a restaurant because of their service and bad Dan dan noodles. I decided to give Dan dan another shot. (How stupid, but I was craving Dan dan.) I yelped and came here.\n\nI came here at 1:30 pm on Sunday. It was empty. Just employees chatting. I thought the store was closed but the guy said he's open so I ordered Dan dan noodles. (This guy was on the phone the whole time I was there. Another couple walked in but they left because of that. No service here.)\n\nTheir Dan dan sauce was nice and spicy. (at least it was not sweet!!) After eating 1\/3 of it. It became just plain noodles. No taste. I don't know why they skimp on the sauce. Bummer.\n\nAfter two bad Dan dan experiences of today's, I will not crave Dan dan for a looong time!!
