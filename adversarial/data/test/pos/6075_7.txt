I love ferris wheels and have been wanting to go on the High Roller observation wheel since it opened. My guy finally surprised me with tickets on an impromptu date night and off we went. Note that there are tons of discounts to be had (military, local, senior, Yelp check in, online offer, etc)- find one that works for you because $35\/pp (adult) is ridiculous.\n\nPre-purchase your tickets online to save time in line. The boarding process is long and somewhat disorganized process involving an escalator, a stop by a bar, \"mandatory\" photo ops (just keep walking), and a maze. Just keep walking, and eventually you'll get to the boarding area. Hit the bathroom when you get a chance, because the line and 30 minute ride can mean an hour til you get to use it again.\n\nTIP: get in the front right corner of your pod as soon as you board so you are in the best spot for photos. Pods aren't overly filled- expect about 20-30 people, and there is seating available. Some pods have bars and HH, we did not do this option. As everyone else says, the view is actually not that impressive and only rave worthy for the 3-5 minutes spent at the top. There's a guide\/trivia video playing during the trip, complete with dad jokes. After disembarking, you exit through the gift shop.
