It's not \"In AND Out,\" it's \"In n Out.\" Try it. Rolls off the tongue a bit more pleasantly, eh?\n\nOH MY GOD I LOVE THIS PLACE. They are always so friendly in the drive thru. They greet you with a sweet, \"Hello, how are you doing today?\" Not, \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY OUR NEW...\" to which I always respond, \"You know, I was thinking about it, but since you asked, no. I will never try your new....\"\n\nSo, anyway, first of all, they are so friendly. They always anticipate my needs. For example, I was asked if I wanted onion on the double-double I just ordered, and I said I was unsure because it was for a friend. He replied, \"That's okay, I'll just put it on the side for you.\"\n\nSo, friendliness ... oh, and they have never, EVER messed up my order. I always order my burgers with ketchup, mustard, pickles, and grilled onions, and that is always how I receive them. Oh, and we haven't even talked about the fries yet. In n Out fries are the bizzomb.\n\nI very seldom get a hankerin' for a burger and fries, but when I do, this is where I go. I feel bad for all my friends in Chicago and Cinci, who have never experienced In n Out.
