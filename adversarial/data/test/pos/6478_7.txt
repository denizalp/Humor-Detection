We decided to come here for my pre birthday celebration.  I liked the ambiance and the location is not overly crowded.  I didn't enjoy that the bartender switched the bottle of wine we selected because they were out of the Chardonnay. I ordered the hummus and friend ordered the Brie and wine of bottle special.  \n\nI ended up with a headache from the replacement wine they served us.  Return factor is low.
