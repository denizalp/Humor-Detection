This private golf course went through a major renovation last year.  Many of the holes were updated with new hazards and the greens were all renovated.  Having played this golf course dozens of times over the years I was excited when a friend of mine invited me to play as I haven't played it since the renovation.\n\nIt was the 2nd week of December and the weather was perfect!  Temperatures in the low 60's, sunny, and no wind!  Are you kidding me?!  This is truly Golf Nirvana!\n\nThe newly renovated course plays a lot different than the old course.  The greens are much faster than they were and many of the greens were made smaller with a lot of undulations.....what this means is it's difficult to get the ball to stick on the green and putting is 10x more difficult.\n\nThe fairways and rough were in excellent condition.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this golf course is that there's no beverage cart.  There's a snack shack on 3 and 14 or you can grab a bite\/drink at the turn.  It's not too bad in the Winter, but in the Summer you wish there were more opportunities to buy beverages.\n\nSome other things I love about this course is that they give you complimentary Bottled Water and Apples between the number 1 and 10 tees.  Additionally, this golf course is located in the community where the real life characters that were featured in the movie Casino actually lived.  You can see the house where Robert De Niro's real life character in the movie lived, which is located off the 15th hole, 5th house on the left.\n\nOverall, it was a great golfing experience....I didn't do so well on the course, but like they say \"A bad day of Golf is better than a good day without Golf\".\n\nOther notes about this place....\n\n- You can rent out space for events here.....Weddings, Parties, Corporate Events.  I've hosted and attended several events in the past, they do a great job here.\n\n- There's a Tennis Club with several courts.  Over the summer they have a kids Tennis camp program.\n\nWill I return?  I can't wait!
