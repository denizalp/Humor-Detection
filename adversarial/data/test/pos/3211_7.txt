Here lies the remains of my Ling & Louie's review, may it rest in peace.\nA once colorful and insightful diatribe, (at least in my opinion) is now rotting somewhere in the depths of a dark and dingy Yelp dungeon. (see below)\nI'll give it another try. Here goes.\n\nLing and Louie's is a nice retreat from all the madness one might expect from an Indian Casino and its trailer-trash, octogenarian patrons. \nTheir Evil Jungle Princess is 8.95 and average, nothing to get excited about.\n\nI took sanctuary in Ling & Louie's after I caught drift of what the Summer's Eve challenged old lady on the slot machine next to mine was cooking, my nose hairs singed beyond recognition.\n\nAs I said, safe haven for under ten bucks is a deal, even if the food is average.\n\n\nHi Diego,\n\nWe wanted to let you know that we've removed your review of Ling and Louie's Asian Bar and Grill, Wild Horse Pass.
