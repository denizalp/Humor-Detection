The Palazzo is becoming one of my favorite hotels in Vegas to stay in. The suite rooms are very spacious and clean. The bathroom is pristine (there's plenty of room to put your makeup on, ladies!) and beds are comfortable and the pillows are plush.\n\nThe casino floor isn't as busy as the Venetian, but there are plenty of slot machines and table games available. They don't have their own food court, but they have several restaurants (Sushi Samba, LAVO, Cut, etc.) nearby and it's attached to the Venetian with a food court and plenty of restaurant options there.\n\nThe service throughout the hotel is very friendly and accommodating, from the registration to the table dealers to the cashiers to housekeeping. The location of the hotel is ideal since it's right next to the Wynn and Encore where a lot of the dayclub and nightclub action is happening these days. (Fun fact: My now-husband stayed at the Palazzo for his bachelor party and I stayed at the Wynn for my bachelorette, and we got married at the Wynn! It was a very short walk in the July heat to the Wynn from the Palazzo).
