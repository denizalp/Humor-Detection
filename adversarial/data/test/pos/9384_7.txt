Ok food but deplorable service. If you want to feel like an animal that has to bark and yell to get any kind of service this place is for you. Getting any attention is like pulling teeth, ordering, or asking for the bill etc.  If there is a line up to get in you might as well forget about it. People will push the people already in line out of their way and clamor their way to the front of the line and steal the spots that should be for the decent people waiting in line. This restaurant caters to the most inconsiderate, obnoxious, rude people this city had to offer and if your not among them you will be invisible to them even when u r the first one in line n standing right in front of them.  Yes, one word - ridiculous. \nI will not go there again.  There r many other places where serve the homeland Chinese food I crave for and offer civilized customer service.
