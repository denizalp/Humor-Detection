Why didn't I find Theresa and do 3d digital eyebrows in the first place? At least I found my way to her eventually. The fear of permanency  made me shudder. Instead I jumped on the trendy microblading wagon and boy was that a bad decision. With their cool microblading Facebook videos, cheap prices and nonchalant promises of being semi-permanent , I jumped in head first (literally)! God was that painful. I could hear my skin ripping. I looked like a clown on crack. Theresa took pity in my poor ugly Bozo the clown brows. I looked psychotic.  She removed them, gave me stunning movie star brows and gave me lots of numbing. The procedure of digital 3d vrs microblading were night and day. I had no scabs and no issues with digital. Theresa did a fantastic job and I don't frighten small children any longer
