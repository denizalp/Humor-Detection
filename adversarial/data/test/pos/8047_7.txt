Went in after shopping to pick up a sub to go yesterday. Clean and quiet place, but somewhat small and the order board is a cluttered mess.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming the owner must be from New York as he failed to leave the attitude there when he moved West. He was ornery, curt, and pretty much regarded me like something stuck to his shoe. The exact opposite of the way he was talking to a supposed regular there whom was in front of me.\n\nThe food was fresh and tasty, but I'd rather pay less at Subway and not get the free side of attitude.
