We wandered over here after a Rockies game when we were looking for something to do. \n\nIt was a great little Western area stuck in the middle of town. All the storefronts look straight from the old movies and it was a very cool little vibe. There's a ton of crap shops around where you can buy shot glasses, tshirts and any local made in China stuff you want. We even passed a guy dressed like John Wayne who was just a touch creepy.\n\nAmple parking, which was nice.
