Spicy. Cheesy. Chicken. Goodness.\n\nDoesn't come with rice, but super filling. We had a cheesy red sauce chicken for two and added the honey garlic pizza. We had about a third of each left when we finished, and we were stuffed. Super stuffed. The chicken has glass noodles, veggies, dumplings, rice cakes, etc. in it. Those dumplings were amazing! The chicken was juicy. There was a good amount of cheese. It's quite spicy though.\n\nNow I want this. I want this now.
