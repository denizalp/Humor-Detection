So Pho King Good! (Those of you who know how to pronounce Pho will get that!)\n\nThis is my favorite little Vietnamese place. I don't know what half the stuff on the menu is, but I had a Vietnamese friend help a sista out.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with rare beef pho. It cures hangovers. It's a scientific fact! And it's huge. I don't think I've ever seen anyone finish it!\n\nIf you have a group of friends, I recommend BBQ. (I love the steak and shrimp combo). So good and you cook it at your table... it's like camping, but with less bugs and not having to pee behind a bush!\n\nThere spring rolls are great and the sauce that you dip it in (not sure what kind it is or what it's made of, but it's divine) has a sweet, fishy taste. I know it sounds weird, but try. You'll be glad you did. You can get the fried, too.\n\nI know this may sound bad, but I think this adds to the awesomeness... When people that are Vietnamese (the natives) are the regular patrons, they must be doing some right.\n\nI am a fan of the Vietnamese iced coffee with consended sweetened milk. Don't drink this late at night. It's extra strong and you will sleep poorly. They had this other drink which had jello and was pink, it looked tasty, but I didn't like it. It was very pretty, though.\n\nHit up Pho So 1. It will make you happy, Pho sure! :)
