With the Memorial Weekend, My friend and I got to the airport about 1.5 hours before our flight. Knowing that libations were the determining factor, the bar at Pei Wei looked decent enough.\n\nA glass of red wine was $14 each and upon ordering, the lovely bartender said the bottle would be $29. Of course, a no brainer! We ordered a spicy chicken with lo mein and a California Roll.\n\nThe chicken and roll were modest at best. The lo mein was just egg noodles, without and seasoning or veggies. The wine was decent. Problem was that we were getting ready to board our flight and not to leave any of the wine behind, we knocked off the bottle.\n\nA bottle of wine for two in 45 minutes. My friend fell asleep upon boarding and during the entire 1 hour flight home.
