As gritty as the edge of downtown it lies in, The Pressroom is a middle-sized venue that's intimate while still large enough to host some reputable acts. \n\nAnd I mean REALLY intimate--I don't think I've ever been so thoroughly patted down by security. \n\nBy the looks of it, it could hold nearly a thousand people. In the back are several bars where you can find some decent beers on tap. Shots too if that's your thing. The acoustics are great, and you can get a good view of the stage from almost anywhere, so you won't miss a beat! \n\nOther bonuses include surprisingly clean restrooms and a spacious patio with some chairs. The little things count, too. \n\nThings that take away from the experience are how freaking hot it is. There is NOT adequate AC in this venue by any means, and the gigantic ceiling fans can only do so much. I can deal with that, but expect to get sweaty!\n\nOverall, I find this to be an above average venue that does a good job of booking a wide array of acts. It too often seems as though metal bands go to Nile, indie acts go to Crescent, and rappers visit Club Red. Shows I've seen listed here are rather eclectic, and hopefully they continue to poach from venues in the east valley.
