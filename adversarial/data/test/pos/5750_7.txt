Over priced to take advantage of the lower income area that receives assistance! VERY sad parasitic situation. In a community where these people need to stretch their assistance they are getting nickled and dimed out of it instead :( it's no coincidence that it's by a bus stop and within walking distance of low income housing.\nThere are police in the store and the parking lot is in disarray. Garbage bags and trash all over. With the highway robbery prices you'd think they would hire someone to clean up the outside. \nHighly picked over and disorganized shelves. Out of a lot of products on sale, probably because of the pricing.
