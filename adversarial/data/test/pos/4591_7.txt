Reservation was 6:45, got there at 6:40, basically empty in the place, told, we are working on your table of 8 now. Fine, whatever, no biggie! The rest of our party comes, they seat us at a table that was \"set up\" already when we walked in the first time! Whatever!\n\nFood: 5 stars plus\nService: 3 stars (that's pushing it)\nPricing: You pay for what you get, it's a ton! \nQuality: 4 stars, we had people at the table who do not like rare or medium, had to beg basically for more well done meat, which was a struggle and waited and waited! Was told by a \"meat server\" one guy had to leave and it backed things up, blah blah blah! \nWe were told at the end (when we were stuffed) there were bbq ribs, really where? Never came to us, until we could barely eat another thing!\nSalad bar: 5 stars! Perfect! \nChocolate cake: when you offer it, be sure that the server tells the table it has nuts on the bottom! Have a bad allergy to nuts, and surprise ordered and ate it, thankfully before I realized and saw them! Fail! And I would have said something but it was a birthday and didn't want to embarrass or cause drama at the table! \n\nNow the one only terrible thing, it was ICE COLD in there as the 3 hour night went on! Shivering in a restaurant, not cool! Yes it was 85 OUTSIDE but didn't need to be 50 inside! \n\nIn comparison to Brasa, Brasa has better service hands down! But all other areas of this place beats it hands down! \nI had gotten a $25 coupon for signing up for newsletters, be careful, you CANT use it on Saturdays! Stupid! \nWill I go back, eh, not sure! \n(thank God I didn't eat the nuts on the cake or this review would have been brutal)
