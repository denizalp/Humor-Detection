When I thought about reviewing a mountain, I quickly thought about all the great things I have done in this world. Many great things. Then, I just threw it all away....because I am about to review a f****** mountain.\n\n\"A\" Mountain (proper verbal spacing and timing required) is a staple for many in Tempe for running and staying active. I love coming here in my morning runs and using the steep paved slope as a tool for my training. Please keep in mind that we are talking about a super-steep climb. The place is great and proper for morning workouts, but can be a pain at times for a couple separate reasons. One of the primary reasons is that A Mountain now requires payment at its base, with parking meters being installed about 1 1\/2-2 years ago. Now I have to park at the Tempe Beach Park parking lot and walk 10 minutes to the mountain if I want to work out without paying a dime. What a crock of __insert word here___! Also, the crowd you get can sometimes be unsatisfactory given space constraints at certain points.  You'll have grandmas you have to cut off and my personal favorite: \"Tad, the sports Jock from the OC who moved to Scottsdale to find himself\". You know, the  sporty jock type who will cut you off and return the favor.\n\nAside from these guys, its a short hike with OK views of the East Valley. I suggest this as a good hike for health-conscious locals, and that's about it. Otherwise, skip this one and go for South Mountain and others if you want some nice views. Pretty simple.\n\nBreak a sweat and enjoy life!
