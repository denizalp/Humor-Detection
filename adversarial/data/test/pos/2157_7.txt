After having the ice cream cookie sandwich from next door I felt we needed just a little something else.. so I had a 'like it', sweet and tart ice cream, meh.. its their attempt at the tangy tart fro yo which was mediocre at best. They need to focus on their strengths. However the customer service in here was awesome! 3 adorable and friendly guys who were super eager to help! Such a great change from the usual little bitches behind the counter. I'd come back for sure!
