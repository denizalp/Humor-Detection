I've been a member for over a year and every experience I've had has been positive.  Their online banking and billpay is extremely user-friendly.  They linked a savings account I setup for my daughter so that I can see her account (and transfer money to it) when I log in to my own account.  I have several \"club\" accounts where I can designate money for specific purposes.  The best part is I am earning better interest here than anywhere else - INCLUDING ING!  \n\nI made up my mind to quit B of A once and for all after they took billions in bailout money (MY taxpayer money) then turned around and announced ANOTHER fee for ME (customer).  All the while, top management there was making annual salaries that I'll never see in a lifetime.\n\nWhat really impressed me was receiving a call on Sunday from the credit union after my husband's particularly busy weekend (his \"honeydo\" list was a mile long).  The CU recognized it as an anomoly based on his past card useage and called him and asked him if he was indeed making all those card purchases.  \n\nI strongly recommend AZSTCU.  If you don't go with them, go with ANY credit union... as long as you leave greedy corporate banks who don't care about you.
