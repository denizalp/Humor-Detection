I was excited when my row mate on the plane told me that Popo's had opened a second location taking over an old Garcia's. I was totally bummed that this Popo's was kind of poopy compared to the original one in Maryvale. \n\nI ordered a cheese crisp and it was so sad I almost cried. The chicken taco was decent and the rice and beans were the requisite decent as were the chips and salsa. What totally sucked was the fact that their \"guacamole\" is something green (not real avocado mixed with sour cream). False advertising and I can just imagine what any lactose intolerant person would have to deal with if consuming this (thankfully, not one of my issues). I managed to order a couple of sides of avocado slices, some lemons and used their decent salsa to make my own guacamole. I grew up on Arizona Mexican food. This was not right on so many levels-except for our server who was adorable and accommodating.
