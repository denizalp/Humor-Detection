Part two of spending my bonus fifty dollars. I've been wanting to stock up on booze for the holidays. And i've had this stupid recipe for Kahlua and soda water in my head since the summer. Giant Fecal on 117th has a liquor store, but i give those a-holes enough of my money. I would like to shop at this place more, but never have cash(cash only). Today- we in there.\n\nGot the Kahlua gift set that comes with two tiki looking mugs. You have to see them, so cute! Also got some gin and some, get this, cherry chocolate beer!!! It's made by O'Fallon's and i can't wait to have one later. The rest of the beer selection is not as fancy as Heinen's or Simone's, but a little more eclectic than Narc's or the afore-mentioned Giant Fecal. Booze choices are pretty standard. Didn't notice any absinthe, but i'm over that stuff anyway. Very convenient for all Warren Villagers. Thanks for the fifty, mom!\n\nParty is at my house tonight.
