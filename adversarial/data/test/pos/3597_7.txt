I was recently part of a wedding party whose groom decided that we would be buying our suits from Tom's.  I have always been told that it woul d be a good place for me to check out good designer suits and so on and so forth, so I was pretty excited.\n\nAs the end goal was matching suits, we were reasonably expected to reserve our jacket size; fair enough.\n\nWhen the day came to go get measured for alterations, a friend of mine was told that they did not have his size and he would have to wear TWO sizes smaller or he \"could always just lose some weight\".  He's a big guy and kind of oddly proportioned, so while still pretty dickish, I could kind of understand that he'd be a difficult fit.  Me, on the other hand, was forced to wear two-sizes UP from a 38, and their solution was to make us pay for a ton of alterations, which still ended up looking far too big.\n\nSuit + Alterations probably cost around $450-500 (I'm not sure how much the alterations cost, but considering they pretty much disassembled and reassembled the suit, I'm sure it was over $100).  For that price, I could have gotten a made-to-measure suit from one of the many online tailors (Brooklyn Tailors, Modasuite, etc) and have it fit like a glove.  Hell, I've bought suits from H&M and Mexx that fit better than this suit after alterations, for less than half the cost!\n\nThis place thrives on people who want to feel they've gotten a bargain for a brand name, instead of spending money on a proper-fitting suit that was made properly for their bodies.
