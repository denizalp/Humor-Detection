There's a teppanyaki area and a regular dining area to eat sushi, Thai dishes, and other non-teppanyaki Japanese dinner entrees. I usually go to the teppanyaki side where you start with a basic hibachi entree which includes onion soup, house salad with ginger dressing, rice (brown, fried, or steamed) OR fried noodles, and veggies (carrots, onions, broccoli, and zucchini) for $8.95. The house salad with ginger dressing is good but the onion soup is a little bland and boring. Then you pick your choice of meat. I went with the NY steak (5 oz) for an additional $7.95. My steak was cooked perfectly. You also get two dipping sauces. The brown sauce is for the meat and the yellow sauce is for your vegetables. The prices are reasonable compared to overpriced Benihana.\n\nNo issues with service from the several times that I have went. I would only come here for the teppanyaki. I ordered the Ohjah Boat (rolls, sushi, and sashimi served on a wooden boat) on a previous visit. The sushi was meh and a bit on the warm side so I will just stick to the teppanyaki here. This is pretty much Benihana's but a lot cheaper where the chefs do their show with the flaming onion volcano, throw an egg in the chef's hat and split it with a spatula trick, & the chef throwing shrimp in your mouth act, etc. I'm not coordinated when it comes to that so I always decline politely. There are a lot of families with kids who like to come here so if you're one of those diners who hate kids, stay away or if you have kids, they would probably enjoy dinner with a show.
