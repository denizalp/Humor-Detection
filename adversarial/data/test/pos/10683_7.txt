Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier and I noticed right away that this location wasn't very big. I came in looking for some paper crafting supplies and the selection was good enough. I did appreciate that they carry a lot of Wilton products because Hobby Lobby is doing away with Wilton stuff and carrying their own Sunny Side brand which is OK for tips and pastry bags, but the cake pans aren't as good quality as the Wilton ones. The fact that here they still have such a nice selection of Wilton products is the main reason why I'd come back here over Hobby Lobby for cake decorating pans and supplies, plus the 40% coupon (get coupon from e-mail or just pull it up on your phone from their website) is always a bonus when buying a cake pan set that's $50 and up. They have a classroom here that you can see as you are walking in towards your left and offer different classes just ask the cashier about what's currently being offered. While this location isn't the biggest it does offer enough of what I am generally looking for.
