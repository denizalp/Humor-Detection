I have a friend on fb who was saying that she absolutely loved this place so i wanted to check it out. Now for the pros....The restaurant is nice it was completely remodeled. Our server was super friendly and attentive. Cons...As far as the food and prices I wasn't too impressed. I had the Cannelloni Gratinati it was ok but not for the price. It says on the yelp menu $14.00 it's actually $16.00 once you get there. Please change the prices on here :\/. Also surprising is that with these price you don't get a side salad? My sister had the lasagna and my mom the eggplant both were ok but again not for the price. I could see having these prices if your on the strip but your not. I probably won't visit again there's too many other Italian restaurants in town with better prices and better food. Giving three stars for decor and server.
