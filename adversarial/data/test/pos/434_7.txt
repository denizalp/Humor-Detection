I'm giving this place two stars because the concept is a great idea. Great for people who don't have time to cook. However, I have lost respect for this company when I was blatantly lied to by a few people at two different locations. As someone with a degree from ASU in Nutrition\/Dietetics I of course asked what the credentials are of the \"nutritionists\" who work here. The girl told me she has a degree in nutrition from ASU. I was told the same thing at the location in Scottsdale. I suspected it was a lie so I called to speak to someone in management and they finally admitted that no one  who works there has a background in nutrition. \n\nI would advise anyone considering buying meals from here to be aware of the high sodium content of their meals but more importantly realize how unprofessional and unethical it is to lie about credentials. When someone tells you that they are a \"nutritionist\" always ask what their background is as this is very different from someone who s a \"dietitian\". Don't let them dupe you. Like I said the concept is good but they could use a little work in business ethics.
