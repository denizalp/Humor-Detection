Wash & Fold: awwwwwww the joy of having your laundry cleaned\/folded for you with such care & service. \n\nI even received a beautiful card from my 'laundry lady' tucked between my sheets. \"Thanks for letting us take of you. Have a great week. Your Laundry Lady.\"  What a wonderful surprise that was to receive!!\n\n\"Professional service that is done right the first time every time\" is their motto to which I will attest to with the sweetness & graciousness from Stella, who gets to know all the regulars and nicknames me 'SUNSHINE'.  And the rest of the staff are professional, nice & funny too. \n\nWow they have been in business for over 55+ years!  So the place isn't modern new looking; but I see them several times a week, my sheets & towels are always clean & ready on time. If they are to be closed for holidays; they always have it posted & they verbally tell me as well.
