Chandler Public Library - Worth a review!\n\nTypically I would not review a Library, but this particular Library is worth it.  It's not the biggest Library.  It's not the most modern Library.  However, it has lots of computers and a super fast wifi connection for those if us with laptops or tablets.\n\nI actually get a lot of work done in this library due to the speed of the internet and several printers available for patron use.\n\nLibrary computer use is free to local Chandler Library Members as well.\n\nCheers!
