illy coffee has got to be, one of the best coffee out there. This location is conveniently located between the Palazzo and the Venetian   and open quite late.  I stayed at the Venetian and after having dinner at Tao, this illy was a fantastic place to end our evening.\n\nThey have a good amount of seating area so you can catch up with friends and family, or simply chill and savor and sip a cup of their excellent espresso. Best of all, they even sell Gelato ice cream and scrumptious desserts.\n\nCheers!
