I love this place.  Today was the first time I've ever been there but honestly, it beats most of the Korean places I've been to.  The food was awesome and the waiter was amazing.  There's an adorable waiter named James and when me and my friends told him it was the first time we came there, he recommended us all the good food.  The service was amazing, our cups where always full and the food came fast onto our tables.  Honestly, I wished I lived closer to this place so I could come here all the time.  Not only where the waiters and food awesome, but the decor in this place was also amazing.  All of the girls I came with, fan-girled over the waiters and I don't blame them.  Every time I go to the Galleria Mall, I'll make sure to stop by this place again!!!  xD
