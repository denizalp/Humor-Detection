I was in Vegas for the weekend and was excited to check out Floyd Mayweathers Strip Club. From the outside it looked really nice. There was a $100 cover charge for men and women, which I felt was weird. Most strip clubs women get in free, but hey we still went in. So as I walk in I was expecting elegance, but all I got was Players Club 2.0. It was soooo disappointing. I'm only giving it 2 stars because I felt the dancers were actually very pretty. I didn't see much pole work happening, which sucks because I look forward to that. They kinda just stood around looking pretty. Mind you we got there at like 4:00am, so maybe they were tired. I don't know I just expected more out of something attached to Mayweather.
