Very friendly, understanding, and compassionate staff. I woke up on Friday morning before an extended weekend with intense tooth pain. My former dentist of five years was closed for the holiday and unable to see me until the following Wednesday. That's no good, my tooth hurts and I'm apparently whining like a small child. My girlfriend called and scheduled me an appointment (way to reward my bad behavior) with Dr Chiem, and they were able to squeeze me in later that same day. \n\nTurns out my old dentist hadn't done the best job installing a cavity. A portion of the cavity had fallen out (hence the pain). The cavity had failed and my tooth has been rotting and I now required a root canal. I was given an estimate (which was very fair) with the opportunity to have to work done right then and there. There's not much I can say, it went as well as a root canal can go. I was given plenty of numbing medication and the doctor checked my comfort levels throughout the procedure (I didn't feel a thing. About an hour later and I was done. I was fitted for a crown and a followup appointment was scheduled for the following week. I left with two prescriptions and less roots. \n\nMy mouth was slightly sore the next morning from being stuck open for so long, and the surrounding gums were also a little sensitive (I was warned this would be the case). I took my pain meds and antibiotics as prescribed and everything felt fine the next morning. I had one more follow up appointment, at no charge, before scheduling my crown install. My tooth was inspected to insure the doctor was comfortable with the results before installing my crown. I couldn't feel anything around the tooth (that's good, that's the whole point of the procedure). I was told to finish up my antibiotics and we scheduled my install appointment for my crown. I'll update my review when they're done with the crown, unless I forget, in which case I'm either dead and unable to update or forgot to update. Either way, I wouldn't fault Stars Dental, unless they somehow killed me by installing a crown. I'm going to assume my gf would update my review or leave her own review discussing how they killed me and I'm now haunting the office. Even still, I'd only take away one star because everyone else was great. Long story short, I give these guys 5 Stars unless you notice a chubby ghost with a beard and glasses haunting their office.
