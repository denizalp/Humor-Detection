I went there and I ordered a large rare beef to go came hone and I had 3 pieces of meat and almost no been sprouts I was pissed I called and complaining because obviously I was hungry and I wanted more than three pieces of meat she said oh well the chef put the same amount of meat for all of them so I got even more mad nice excuse me I paid for a large you're telling me that they put the same amount and regardless of the size so why would I be paying for a large and getting a small you're ripping people off she wouldn't do anything for me saying I'm not in control I can't do anything next time I'll just give you more meat I want it was so mad Plus to make matters worse my boyfriend went and walked into the kitchen and it was filthy there was literally a bowl of meat sitting on the floor it was disgusting boy caught it I swear to God I will never ever ever ever again it is disgusting and they are rude and they rip you off I wish I could knew how to delete my old review
