Was just in there, solo, to chill out, eat some pizza, drink some wine and hang out. \n\nRandom drunk dude (at 8:30pm) approaches me and asks me if I want a shot of Jack (no). Proceeds to harass me about my haircut and ask me if I know his homeless buddy who, also, is from Seattle. \n\nThen he asks me if I have a problem with him? \n\nPizza to go please!\n\nI called the bartender after I left and told him he had a problem on his hands with that guy and he seemed receptive but, honestly, he should have sniffed that problem out right away.\n\nShit shouldn't get that weird in a place like that. There were families in there and I'm sure they weren't looking for a guy like that around them. \n\nFull disclosure; I like to party and I do like to drink and be inappropriate... a lot. Just not in someplace like that. Ain't nobody got time for that when there are kids around.\n\nPizza was OK out of a box at home. Drank a beer and jumped in the pool.
