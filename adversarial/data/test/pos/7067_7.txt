FYI: That picture of Coco and I is 100% REAL. She was NOT a wax figure! :)\n\nTHE SHOW:\n\nI am so glad my girls and I watched Peepshow for my sister's bachelorette party! Coco is freakin awesome and I wanted to see that booty in real life!! LOL.\n\nWith the help of Heather from Base Entertainment, I was able to book three VIP tables literally right next to the stage for 10 girls, months in advance. The theatre is located inside of Planet Hollywood so when I arrived, I was able to pick up my tickets on a Saturday evening right before the show was about to start. \n\nThe doors opened 30 minutes prior to the show so us ladies who are always on time, we were the first to be seated. The stage and theatre wasn't as big as I imagined. It was big but not compared to Cirque du Soleil. The VIP tables and chairs were really close to each other and the tables were small which made it difficult since we ordered bottle service. Imagine a bucket of ice, two bottles of alcohol, mixers, water and popcorn on this tiny table...no bueno. But somehow, it worked!\n\nAfter settling in with some cocktails and popcorn the show started. I LOVED it! I enjoyed every minute of the show. The performers\/dancers\/singers (men and woman) were amazing! Since I was so close to the stage, I was able to see all the cute lingerie they had on how tone and athletic looking each of the dancers were. I loved how everyone on stage interacted with us waving, winking and pointing. It made us feel special (and it would have made you feel special too, don't lie!). There was a lot of singing, dancing, hair swinging, outfit changes, BOOBIES, and some comedy which made the show so much fun to watch. My favorite was the pole dancer and \"my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard\" performance. The show was featuring Holly Madison but as a temporary replacement, Coco Austin stepped in. Although the show's headliner is \"Peepshow, starring Coco Austin\" Coco wasn't on stage as much as I wanted to her to be. She made some appearances here and there, mostly standing and looking hot but when she was on the stage dancing, she rocked it!\n\nThe show ran 90 minutes long with no intermission. It went by pretty fast. At the end of the show, we asked one of the workers to take a picture of the group and they did so without rushing us out or being rude (the next show started in 30 minutes so they had to hurry up and clean). Our server was super nice and was very patient with us. All 10 girls walked out very happy we picked Peepshow!\n\nMEET AND GREET:\n\nAgain, thanks to Base Entertainment, I was able to set up a few meet and greet with the girls and Coco. My sister, the bachelorette is also a HUGE fan of Coco so us girls decided it would be fun to surprise her with a meet and greet! \n\nThe meet and greet takes place AFTER the last show. The last show usually ends around midnight so the meet and greet started around 12:30AM. Coco came out with her doggies and we were all able to chit chat with her, cheers with a champagne toast and take some pictures with her. Coco is super sweet, so down to earth and talked a lot with us! \n\nAll 10 girls had a blast! Great job Peepshow!
