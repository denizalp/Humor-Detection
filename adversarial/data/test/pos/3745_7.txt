This is the Chinese takeout downtown residents have been waiting for. \n\nAfter so many bad experiences elsewhere, I must say...this is the one. \n\nI haven't run into something I didn't like. The fried rice is top notch, and both veggie sides and chicken entrees are bomb. Lunch specials might take 10-15 minutes to prepare, but they're made RIGHT. \n\nAnd if you want to dine in, there's TONS of space as well. \n\nIf you need something reliable, look no further than Siu.
