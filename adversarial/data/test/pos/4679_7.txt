Booooo I lost my jacket and wallet (maybe lost) but I now no longer have my wallet or my jacket after visiting this establishment. Sucks too cause that was my favorite leather jacket - I can get the credit cards and ID back fairly easily but that jacket has all the right scuffs in all the perfect places. Ugghh - management totally has their heads up their ass unless your VIP.... Blah blah blah - I never have these problems at sapphire or rhino.
