After hearing so many great things about Zafran, I was looking forward to trying them since this location is not far from my side of town.  I visited this location during the week but I called my order in since I had a few questions about some of the menu items.  Once I arrived I was greeted by an older gentleman that I believe is one of the owners, he was very sweet and offered a few samples for me to try off of their dinner buffet while I waited for my to go order.  I didn't realize they had a buffet but I will keep that in mind for my next visit.  This location is not very spacious, especially with the buffet so it was a little tight around the buffet area.  I was able to sample the biryani, tandoor chicken and a dessert.  All just ok.\n\nI ordered the samosas, chicken kabab, tikka masala, daal tadka, peshawaree naan, and regular naan.  The samosas were pretty good, crispy and fresh.  The chicken kabab is ground chicken not boneless and I was not a fan, not flavorful just bland.  The tikka masala was also very bland and greasy.  Both naan were plain and lacked flavor which was very disappointing.  When I placed my order for the daal tadka I wanted to make sure that it was not spicy and I was told it was not, however it was too spicy for me to enjoy which made me sad because it was the only thing that I really liked but it was just too hot.  I would like to think that I would return because the staff was so welcoming but the food was such a disappointment.
