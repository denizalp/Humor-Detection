It is funny how you can see what that tried to convey, and by them I mean the people that thought up this place.. designed a laid back atmosphere around an existing building that used to be a motorcycle dealership or something to that effect. \n\nService was nice, and both males and females seem to be instructed in how to dress and how to act. Dress - hipsteriffic nerdy kitsch, and act - semi-upscale nice. And they almost pull it off on both accounts, and I will not say a negative word about it due to the fact that they seem to pull it of. And by pull it off, I mean create revenue.\n\nI can only talk about the Yard section, which is a roof covered outside area that has plenty of places to sit and it is quite cozy. They have fussball and corn-hole and other outside yard-crap that is very cool, but I didn't take advantage of these sweet activities. Instead I planted myself in a cozy chair and have great conversation while I sucked down some tasty wheat brews. The food looked nice, and they all said it tasted good. I saved room for some more tasty wheat brew.\n\nAn odd, but cool detail is that when you walk into the mens room, you see that the.. nope, I leave that surprise to you. I laughed though.

The parking is crappy. Valet only.
