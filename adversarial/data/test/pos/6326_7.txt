i was hesitant about the change but gave it a shot. you can still do the \"make your own salad\" bar with some soups and the same mac n cheese they used to have.\n\nbut you can also do a fancy-pants salad. i got the california cobb. it had this awesome chunky shredded turkey that they now roast on site. tasted like legit roasted turkey, not a preprocessed slab of meat. and this salad was, i think, cheaper than the old sweet tomatoes salad bar.\n\ndidnt get to try any deserts though, they were all sold out on the night i went.\n\nbiggest complaint, i guess, was that i wish they woulda given me an actual cup for water, not some rinky-dink 6oz plastic thing.
