My parents had eaten here before its makeover by Restaurant Impossible, and they were interested in checking it out again, so we went to dinner here on Tuesday night.\n\nThe decor was nice but it was very loud--we had to shout at each other to hear and it wasn't even very crowded. I wished we had sat outside.\n\n I noticed that the restaurant seemed understaffed or perhaps it was just that our server was inexperienced. Our server was hardly there. We were brought water very quickly (by a busser or host) after being seated, but did not see a server for quite some time. We put our dinner orders in on her first visit  to the table, but we hadn't chosen what to have to drink. I told our server I was going to pick out a wine, expecting her to check right back, but she didn't. Our food was delivered by a food runner and we ordered our drinks then. \n\nAfter we got our meals, she didn't check back with us for quite some time, even when she was with the tables next to us. This tells me she was new at serving (and not down with multi-tasking yet. I remember that vaguely from when I first started waiting tables).\n\nI ordered the chicken ossobuco because the description in the menu was delightful (braised chicken legs with roast herb pan sauce over mushroom risotto). Unfortunately, the flavors weren't very subtle and the risotto was greasy--plus, it had a yellow cheese on it, which turned me off. The chicken was good, though, and I got to share it with my dad, who only ordered a salad.\n\nThe others in my group, by the way, enjoyed the food more than I did. My cousin had the pizza gattopardo, my mom had veal piccata, and my dad had the della chiesa salad. I didn't taste their meals, but based on my experience, I wouldn't want to return.
