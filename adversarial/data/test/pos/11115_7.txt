They were very affordable but it was definitely a \"get what you pay for\" situation. I had hired them for clean up and they did a half-ass job. I had to repeatedly ask them to go back when they said they were \"done\" because they still had left a tone of weeds in the ground and ones they pulled up just laying about. The leaves were not completely picked up either. Also only one worker spoke English so it made it difficult to communicate with them. I will never hire Snappy again or recommend them. Get your moneys worth and go somewhere else.
