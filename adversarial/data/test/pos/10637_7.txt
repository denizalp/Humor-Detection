Pretty good hot dogs that are a bit overpriced is what you'll get if you visit one of the many Nathan's Famous locations on the Las Vegas strip. \n\nStopped by the New York New York location with friends after I was told by one of my friends that the hot dogs were good...and good they were. I got a chili cheese dog that was about the size of an average hot dog. Lots of flavor came from the link with a nice crunch from the outer layer when biting into it. The chili was decent as well. To top it off was a liquid cheese that didn't add nor take away from the hot dogs flavor. I do prefer shredded cheese but you work with what's available.\n\nThis cost $8 and some change. Pretty steep for the portion especially when you can grab a Vegas foot long hot dog with chili and cheese within the $2 to $4 range if that's anything to compare portion wise. However, Nathan's hot dogs are a lot more flavorful which will leave you wishing it was bigger for the cost. I actually wanted another one but wasn't going to fork out another $8 or so. At least not during the same visit.\n\nNathan's is convenient especially when it comes to late night eats that are fast to get to within the hotel to help ease any alcohol consumption. With that being said, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't pay the cost again sometime in the future. Great taste but needs to ease on the prices.\n\nDinner 8\/20\/2016
