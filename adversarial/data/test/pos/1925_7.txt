Tim, you and the dealer you represent have    only added to the reasons people would rather have their teeth pulled than go buy a new car from a dealer!!  You are dishonest, misleading, and could care less about anything other than yourself and more importantly your bottom line.  So don't hide behind your kind response, simply live with the fact that you and your dealership are slime balls.  I filed a complaint with Chevy this morning and hope they reprimand you and your dealership.  They will deal with you as I am done doing so.
