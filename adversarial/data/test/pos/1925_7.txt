Came here to grab some coffee and a cookie before heading over to the Panda show that's right next to this cafe.   We came here today on July 4th around 7pm and this cafe was quite busy.   It took nearly 20 min before we got our regular coffee.   This is something that should've taken no longer than 5 minutes but there were only 2 people working at the time.   They did their best to work as fast as they possible can but there were too many customers and we were getting frustrated.   Our show was going to start at 7:30pm and we were very worried because it took forever to get our drinks.   I noticed customers yelling and showing their frustration to the cashier and the lady making the drinks.   These customers also had a show to catch and service was unacceptably slow.   I couldn't believe why management didn't have more people working here on a holiday weekend.   Both the coffee and chocolate chip cookie was delicious.   I liked how the cookie was soft and had bits of walnut with just the right amount of chocolate chips.   5 stars for my order.   5 stars and two thumbs up to the two people working there tonight.   0 stars to the Grand Lux management!
