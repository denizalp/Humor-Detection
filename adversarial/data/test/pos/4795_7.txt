I had wanted to try this place for a while so I met a friend here for lunch. I arrived first and sat at the bar for a while before I received service. Finally someone approached me and asked me if I was there for a job as the bartender. I said no but spent the entire lunch wondering what about me looked jobless. I thought it was funny and really has nothing to do with my rating. \n\nDecent selection of beer on tap, I had a delicious IPA.  I ordered a burger with a fancy name & aioli mayo or some bullshit like that but it was basically a patty with bacon on top. It wasn't good at all, I only took a few bites but what I did eat sat in my stomach and made me feel gross all day.  The service never really got better but there was a speedy and fun glam guy working the patio that made me wish we would have moved out there once my buddy arrived.  \n\nI've wanted to give them another try but I associate the place with the gross feeling now and can't force myself to go back.
