The HYPE is real! Lol\nI actually really like this place, although my random craving for sweets is rare!\n\nCupcakes and Ice Cream! What more can you ask for?!\n\nHad a scoop of the Cap'n Crunch (available all days of the week) in a Red Velvet Cone!\nNot too sweet, lil crunchy pieces in the ice cream were delicious! And the cone was amazing, only because I love anything red velvet!\n\nLots of flavors (both cupcakes and ice cream) to choose from! \n\nLine gets long but worth the wait!\nGreat place to check out especially if you're enjoying the new spot in Vegas, The LINQ!
