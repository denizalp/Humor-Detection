This place is great! $20 for a 1 hour massage with hot stones and a little bit of stretching. Such a good value! The waiting area is nice and clean. I only waited for a brief moment for them to set up. In the meantime, you can help yourself to water or tea. I'd recommend wearing something loose and comfortable. At some point the guy lifted up my shirt and unhooked my bra for the hot stones. If that makes you uncomfortable, they have private rooms for an additional price. Just wish he would've rubbed my butt more. I love that. I think he was just trying to be courteous. What a gentleman.
