Checked this place out today and was really impressed! Had delicious garlic butter cheesy breadsticks and a ceasar salad. The food was great, but what really stood out to me was the service. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and gave us a really great overview of what \"Quad City\" style pizza was all about... because I had never even heard of it before today! \n\nThey have the walls decorated with pizza boxes signed by people from the quad cities, which gives it a really personal feel. \n\nI watched the waitress deliver a taco pizza to a table across the room, and I'm DEFINITELY ordering that next time- it looked out of control!\n\nThey're not close to where I live, or I'd eat there more often.
