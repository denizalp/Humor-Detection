The Normal was the placed picked for February's Breakfast Club UYE, and I have to say after hearing a few friends rave about it, I was excited to try them out!\n\nLet's start off by saying The Normal is far from any normal joint you would eat in, the art work is definitely something to talk about, I love it! The wall mural in the larger back dining area is just great! There's a cat peering over the snow cap mountains looking onto small little children who could become his meal, haha or maybe that's what I was thinking, but if you go to the Normal, check out this wall, and walk away with your own stories. Can't wait to bring the boys back here so they can check this place out. \n\nAfter checking out the menu I went with The Hash, its braised beef short rib over roasted potatoes in a chile sauce and I topped with 2 over medium eggs, it also comes with corn tortillas, I have to say, so far this has been one of the best breakfasts I have had, I loved it! I could eat this every day for every meal and still crave it! It was delish! I want to try out the other amazing items on the menus because everyone's dishes looked great, but I'm afraid I'm already hooked to The Hash. \n\nYep The Normal is a great place to try!
