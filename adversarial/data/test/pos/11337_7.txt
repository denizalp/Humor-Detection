Been here lots of times, mostly during happy hour which has some great deals.\nThis time a group of friends invited me for breakfast so we rode bikes up for the Sunday morning buffet. Well worth the $9.99. \n\nScrambled eggs, bacon. sausage, eggs benedict (YUM),  cream cheese blintzes, french toast sticks and biscuits with sausage gravy. HELL to the YES I'm in for all that!!!\n\nService was lame for everything from drink refills to replacement plates, and she even handed back all the checks to me to divvy up between the 12 of us (Really?). Oh well, no matter. I would still go back in a heart attack, I mean heart beat. \n\nDid I mention they have \"all you can eat\" bacon?! MMMMmmmm, Bacon.
