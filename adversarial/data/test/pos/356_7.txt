So basically, I bought grass for lunch. But, hey, don't knock it till you've tried it - this was still a tasty and appetizing meal!\n\nAfter hearing good things from various colleagues, I visited around 12:45 PM on a Wednesday afternoon and the lunch rush was basically over (lineup was very minimal). Unlike iQ Foods, I didn't have to wait 25 minutes just to order, food preparation was quick and efficient (I received my order less than 10 minuets after paying), staff were friendly and sweet, and very welcoming. \n\nI ordered the Californication Lunch Box (cabbage, snow peas, corn, peppers, alfalfa sprouts, peanuts, sesame seeds on quinoa), chicken, and honey sesame and thai peanut sauce.  Don't let the picture fool you - this was actually really appetizing. The sauce made the salad - a wonderful sweetness, and the ingredients were extremely fresh, the veggies so crispy, great temperature, and by the end of the meal, you feel super refreshed. \n\nYes, it's pricey, and portion size is just average. But, taking the whole experience into account (staff, wait times, freshness of ingredients, careful preparation, and decently sized menu), it was pleasant, and I'll be back. \n\nFor my salad, I paid $11.26 after taxes. Note that the Richmond-Adelaide Centre location does NOT serve their famed breakfast menu (the TD Tower location does).
