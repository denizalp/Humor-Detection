I don't know why this place gets rated so high and appears on list of \"best burgers in the GTA\". I tried it once and was not very impressed. The food is extremely greasy and I was not impressed by the taste or quality. The service was not very friendly. It seemed like the staff didn't want to be there. There are definitely better burger places out there.
