I went on a Thursday night last week when there were about 5 other parties in total at the restaurant.  I ordered the monkfish and my boyfriend ordered the steak.  Even though they were not busy, it took one hour for our food to arrive.  My fish was room temperature just bearable enough to eat, but our server would not have known because he didn't stop back to ask how the food was until 20 minutes into the meal.  My fish was also not cooked completely through.  It was so tough to cut that a piece of fish ricocheted off of my plate to the floor.  The piece that did fall was about 20% of our meal given that the entrees don't include sides: just a few garnishes and sauce here and there.  After I paid my $100 bill, I concluded that I got the kind of service that suggested the folks here didn't want me to come back.\n\nOn the bright side the beer I got was pretty good.  They have a good selection of alcohol, but it's a little ridiculous that I was charged $1 for ice.  I'm sure the waiter didn't mention it because it's ridiculous.  Outside of the nice atmosphere of the place, this is a failed gastro pub. (I should have known by the vibe I got from the lack of patrons.) Entrees should not average $25 just to be meager and cold.
