I'm giving Ghost Bar 5 stars for a number of things, even though when I was here in January of 2012 it was literally a 'ghost' bar. LOL. That didn't bother my friend and I as we still had a good time. \n\n1. Gorgeous view of the strip \n2. Drinks were good & not too pricey\n3. Being it was dead the night we were there, we were able to sit at a table without purchasing bottle service & without any problems so that was nice.\n4. While sitting at our table, a very LARGE and very DRUNK man came and sat next to my friend and I. We sort of sat there and laughed it off and continued our conversation, but he then proceeded to yell some strange word in our faces, \"SHATTA\". We looked at each other like is this man serious, and within 10 seconds, 5 bouncers were right there ready to remove him from the club, and they did. After this whole little scene, one of the bouncers came over to us and apologized and asked us if we needed anything, which made us feel very comfortable. Thumbs up to Ghost Bar Security! \n\nCool place and I will most definitely visit again when I'm back here in May. Weather will be nicer so hoping it'll be more high energy.
