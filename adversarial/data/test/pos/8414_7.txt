In the continuing effort to find the \"unique and unusual\" around Vegas and slightly beyond, my adventures led me to this place for an event.\n\nDon't be surprised if you're driven past this on your travels to Red Rock.  You wouldn't think much about it, but the ranch itself is charming.  My first impression was met with the charming and wild (yet semi-tame) burros that wander around, and will greet you in hopes that visitors will offer them a treat.  I'm not going to lie: I brought one celery and named him \"Stanley\", of which he did not object to either option.\n\nThe ranch itself looks like something out of the late 1800's or an Old West movie set.  There's plenty of little shops and eateries (I've heard the main restaurant is really good, though I've yet to try it), and it's a pretty area to walk around and get lost in.\n\nThere's also a train to ride back and forth from the parking lot, and a petting zoo for the kids.  There's even a hotel (again, another thing I hadn't tried), but still interesting to find all of this out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI haven't seen any of their live shows, but the staff that I met were very friendly and accommodating.  I'll have to go back one day when the whole event is in full swing to experience everything properly.\n\nIt's a neat place, very quiet, and certainly very different from the majority of the \"tourist\" fare out here.  If you want a little out of the way place to explore that looks like it's from a different era, you'll have found what you're looking for here.
