Ordered a veal shoulder on Monday, butcher told me he would order it on Tuesday and he would call me on Wednesday when it arrived. I called on Thursday to ask if it had arrived and was told I should have ordered it on Monday. \n\nPeople like this are the reason shampoo bottles have directions on them.
