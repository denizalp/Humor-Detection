Omi is my favourite Japanese restaurant in the city. Why you ask?\n\nFrom the moment you walk in the door until the second you leave full of delicious goodness you are treated like royalty by the staff. The decor is casual yet classy with small tables lining an exposed brick wall and a small sushi counter off to the other side where the chef can be seen using a blow torch to cook the scallops for the sushi pizza.  \n\nI've been to OMI about 5 times now and have always been served by the same server...I'd like to think he owns the restaurant because it is obvious he is passionate about great service, quality food and ensuring that each customer has a great dining experience. \n\nMoral of the story: Go check it out for yourself. Believe me, food is incredible. Order the daily catch items...I swear the server must go out and fish it himself between delivering you the hot saki and bringing you your miso soup. Also order...beef Enoki Rolls, Agadashi Tofu, blow torched scallop sushi pizza...and everything else on the menu. You will not be disappointed.
