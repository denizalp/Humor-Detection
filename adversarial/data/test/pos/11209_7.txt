I used to love this place.  Perhaps my taste buds changed over the years.  The half and half drink I always order just seemed WAY too sweet and the service is rude.  We came here on a Saturday night during the New years weekend and the place was crowded with at least 20 people in line.  There were about 5 people working that night and I can sense the tension amongst the workers.  Then again, who wouldn't be stressed out during a major holiday weekend?\n\nAfter I got my drink, it was overly sweet and wanted more ice in it.  I asked the first guy behind the counter for more ice and he pointed towards the other female barista.  I walked over to her and she gave me this angry look.  She said she was busy and had to serve the other customers first.  I asked again after she was done serving that other customer and she argued why I need more ice in my cup.  I told her it's because the drink was too sweet and she argued back saying that's the how it should taste.   I asked her to just give me extra ice and she finally hands me a cup of ice.  \n\nYes I understand people working during the holidays are stressed out but why argue about a simple request such as extra ice?  It's not like I asked her to make my drink all over again.  All she had to do was hand me a cup of ice.  Done.  Simple.  \n\nIf a family of 4 orders drinks\/gelato here, be prepared to spend close to $30.  It's not cheap but you get pretty good quality for what you pay.  However, I was quite disappointed with the service and how I can't have my drink the way I want it.  Less sweet.
