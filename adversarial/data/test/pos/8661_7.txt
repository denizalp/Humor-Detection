Maaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIT'S OVER!!! OVER!!!  Hands down the one place that you HAVE to eat at, at least once when you are in Vegas is the Peppermill!  For all you gamblers who like to spin 2\/3 of your day at the tables... eat here first!!  The biggest fricken Chicken Fried Steak I've ever seen!  Seriously the size of a plate... The Nachos (where'd my girl go)? They shouldn't even call them Nachos... I had to look around them to see her.  I was sooooo faded I shouldn't remember this place.. \nPeppermill can you send me a frequent buyers card?  I love you! I love you!
