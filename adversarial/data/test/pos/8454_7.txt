Yesterday was my second of many to come to Fat Sandwich...  .\n\nGreat Food, Super Employees, VERY Comfortable N Friendly Atmosphere. As I stood there watching them prepare orders, each sandwich was prepared with care, as if they were fixing them for their selves.\n\nThe price, compared to what you get is unbelievable..\n\nMy advise is to either take a friend and split a sandwich or be really, really hungry. Or you can do as I did, make two meals out of it. The Sandwiches warm up real good in a toaster oven...\n\nSo if you're tired of that hum-grum burger joint... Fat Sandwich is the place for you...  \n\nMamahlf\nA Very Happy Senior\n\nPS... For all you 1,2,3, Star Raters... Please explain to me why you would go into a place named 'FAT SANDWICH\", THAT LIST FRIED BURGERS, FRENCH FRIES AND OTHER FRIED FOODS.. THAN COMPLAIN THAT THE FOOD IS GREASY, FRIED AND UNHEALTHY... DUH!!!
