Not much to say here, because aside from all the fake-country-flare, there's really not much going on.\n\nI'm reminded of one of the characters played by Meg Ryan in 1990's Joe vs. the Volcano -- the 'flib-a-da-jib-et' lady who kept saying, \"I have no response to that\".\n\nPile up all the country kitsch you want, whether in the lobby or on the plate, and I just have no response to that.
