What an amazing event! I'm truly grateful to be part of the Yelp Elite family. I felt so spoiled throughout the entire time and took many photos of the food and drinks. \n\nThe pasta and meatballs were so good - I had seconds! I tried the \"Norma Jeane\" and \" Tanzy Mule Lemon-Berry Grey Goose\" both were amazing. The \"Norma Jeane\" had a sweet and refreshing taste, definitely my favorite. The Tanzy Mule had a strong ginger taste so if you like ginger this drink is for you! \n\nWe had an hour to mingle with fellow Yelpers! I saw a few familiar faces and made a couple new friends - awesome! Let me tell ya, we were SPOILED especially with the popcorn from iPic Theatres and complimentary drink waiting for us at our \"pods\". \n\nI would say Tanzy and iPic Theaters is the perfect combination - a true triple threat. Thank you so much for the great hospitality! I was in awe in the entire time. From the light bites to the alcoholic beverage waiting at the pod, I think its safe to say its acceptable to shed a (happy) tear. It was the perfect date night!!  \n\nFirst Man was a great and informative movie but a little too long. The Pink M&M GCC helped keep me awake throughout the movie. \n\nSpecial thanks to Hailey P. for always putting on a wonderful event! I cant wait for the next event! #NeatToBeElite
