So glad that this little gem opened up not too far away from me! I appreciate a nice little coffee shop and loved this one. First off, if I was just relying on google maps to find it I'm pretty sure I would've gotten lost because it doesn't give very specific directions ha. It is in the strip mall type thing behind, can't see it from the street!\nOne thing that made me happy in terms of how it looked was the teal accents. It's my favorite color and seeing it everywhere instantly made me excited about maverick ha. \nThe prices here aren't too crazy which is rare, and good for the area! I noticed they have a veggie goat cheese sandwich, and I intend to try it another time. Also the food they had on display looked awesome. Some kind of cake covered in shredded coconut and chocolate, looked incredible!\nUsually I go for tea, but I decided to change things up and got an iced mocha with almond milk. It always makes me happy when almond milk is an option. I got a small and it was plenty for me, but it did not cost much more to get a bigger size. Sometimes mochas are too coffee-ish and the flavor is too strong, but I really liked the mocha I had! Not too sweet, not too milky, just right. My mom got an iced white tea and she loved it. I tried it and liked it too, was super refreshing, perfect for a hot day.\nMaverick coffee is a great addition to all of the amazing restaurants in the Scottsdale and Shea area, glad I stopped in.
