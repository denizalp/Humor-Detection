Been here twice. First time was terrible. Today was horrible. Hair cutter first initial K. All she did was try to cut my hair as fast as possible, while answering the phone. As she was cutting you could tell that the shears she was using had not been sharpened in a while. It was more of a pulling than cutting sensation. I paid for shampoo and that was terrible and received no conditioner. Save yourself a bad haircut and go up the road to nearby competitor. Worst haircut ever in Anthem.
