This store has moved to a bright, clean location at Yonge St. just south of Eglinton on the West side. I was there today and the gentleman who owns the store was very kind to me, showing me some cool gadgets. One was something I already own so I know he is correct (a heavy handheld lemon squeezer). The other item was something I was sooooo tempted to buy (a mandolin) but I'll wait until next time I pop by there. He's still unpacking boxes and setting up - I'd say 80% ready. There are TONS of things to browse and buy and everything is top quality keep-forever stuff.\n\nI just read the other two yelp reviews here and one was very positive, yet only 3 stars were given. The other was mildly negative (bitter, I thought, considering what really happened) and a cruel 1 star was given. I have been a Peppermill customer for about 17 years. When I had my first job I set up my first kitchen with many items purchased at the now-closed Hazelton location. I hope my 5 stars (and a few other nice customers doing the same) can help bring Peppermill's yelp score up to where it should be, which is around 4.5 stars.
