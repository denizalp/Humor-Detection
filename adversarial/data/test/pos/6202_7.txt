Well I just bought food today and I'm really mad at them. I swear that never come back to this place again. They over charge me for everything. I ask for addition fish sauce and got charge for $3 for tiny plate. They charge me for $30 for 2 portion beef noodle. I just upset because the way the do business is not the same as couple years ago. Really disappointed.
