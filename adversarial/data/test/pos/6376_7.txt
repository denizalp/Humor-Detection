I purchased a massage Groupon from this business for my husband for Christmas as we have just moved into the area and he loves his massages. I also am looking for a reputable chiropractor ( we moved from Vancouver and are in the market for virtually everything new) Every time I tell them I want an appt for a massage, and they find out it's a groupon, they push the appt to well over a month out....no thank you!  I use Groupons all the time and 9 times out of 10 become a loyal client!! This is the vessel I use to find new places of all types. I find this to be offensive and I don't think businesses that treat the Groupon clients like this should throw deals!!\nI see the reviews are very good for here and I am saddened by the fact that I will now be looking for a new place, out of principle.
