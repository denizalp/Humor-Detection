Not sure what all the 5 stars are about.  Went here based on Yelp reviews, which I must say I was disappointed in.  The service was excellent.  The young lady that helped us was very friendly, offered samples and explained the menu.  The ice cream is not homemade.  It is Thrifty brand.  They have at least 20 flavor options.  The samples I tried had a freezer burn aftertaste.  I ended up with the grasshopper sundae, which on Sunday's is only $3.50.  They run a daily special and Sunday's special happened to be $2 off any sundae.  The sundae consisted of 2 huge scoops of mint chocolate chip, a small brownie cookie, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, a huge healing of whipped cream and a few chocolate shavings.  It was ok, but definitely didn't set my taste buds on fire. I tried an M&M cookie and while it was ok, the overall impression it left was just that \"ok\".  The store itself seemed outdated and in need of a good cleaning.  I think I will move on and try another Vegas option next time I have a hankering for some scream, ice cream that is!
