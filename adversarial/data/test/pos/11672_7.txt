I absolutely have a soft spot for pho places. This place did not disappoint me. We came in around 9:15pm on a Sunday and it was quite empty. They automatically brought us tea to drink. After we wrote down what we wanted they did not take long at all to being us our food! I got a small special pho and it was a decent size for the price. It was piping hot! Extremely tasted and flavourful.\n\nI will be returning here if I am ever in the Meadowvale Town Centre area in Mississauga.
