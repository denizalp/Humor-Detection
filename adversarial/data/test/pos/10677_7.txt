Last visited in early 2016, the Sin City smoked Meats scene dramatically improved since that time by Big B's Texas BBQ, it was lured in by an all-new Brunch menu that four guests sat down inside Michael Mina's PUB 1842 on Saturday, Tony Schutz having moved up the ladder to toque STRIPSTEAK in the interim but Chef Isaiah Utter still showing Las Vegas Boulevard that when done right \"Bar Food\" can be innovative...though like many casino Restaurants it comes at a price.\n\nSurprisingly now in its sixth year of business but still sort of under-the-radar given its location, a turn past Emeril's in The District not far from Grand Garden Arena, it was minutes prior to noon that a table just inside the door was found with a placard labeled \"RESERVED,\" an unnecessary accommodation during the off-season for most sports as the space would never even reach 1\/8 capacity over the course of ninety minutes.  \n\nGreeted promptly by new staff, both male and female managers professional yet pleasant while a young server named Miguel showed the sort of skill that would be well suited to a Steakhouse or next-tier Restaurant such as Bardot, it was from a menu of old favorites and new creations that Brunch would begin a slow roll-out, eight Cocktails served in two \"flights\" starting things off with both a fizzy Sangria and the Fruit-forward Dorsey favored by those imbibing.  \n\nServed family-style in two courses, the first comprised of sticky Chicken Legs with thick Blue Cheese dipping Sauce plus a pair of favorites available all the way back during visit number one in October 2013, suffice it to say that no Pretzel in the Valley has yet to trump PUB 1842's that comes ready to be dredged in Beer Cheese floating a poached Egg and Bacon while layers of Nachos laid out like abstract art also perform as strong today as when initially devoured in full rather than half-size portion.\n\nNot at all a \"cheap\" Restaurant, even Michael Mina's ingredient quality and skilled staff seeing it difficult to justify prices more than double that of some competitors, it was momentarily suspending reality that $28 Hash landed in Cast Iron and impressed by way of crisp yet succulent Beef amidst Peppers and Onions plus tender Potatoes, the two-Egg topping helping to meld flavors here but on the other hand muting them in the case of Pulled Pork and smoky Cream atop a fluffy Waffle that would have been nice to taste without all the sog-inducing additions. \n\nGiven the opportunity to next sample Brisket, Pulled Pork and Ribs as smoke and fire intended, the shredded Pig again sweeter than preferred and perhaps one reason to consider the aforementioned Waffle more successful than on first bite, it would be tough to name better Ribs in recent memory than those Utter sent out while the fatty Brisket goes neck and neck with Big B's for best in the area, though the mom n' pop location in Henderson still easily takes the title for Beans.\n\nRemembering a time when some of Mina's Restaurants served complimentary Cornbread instead of one small Muffin meant to be shared it was assuming the Waffle was as delicious that a side of Sweet Potatoes showed just how good PUB 1842 can be at its best, the textures and flavors all complex and complimentary just as they were in the lone Dessert titled \"Campfire S'mores\" while the $21 Monte Cristo had all the right elements but too much Batter and frying time that led to it being even heavier than usual.\n\nTHREE STARS: Somehow even more expensive than memory serves it is not so much that PUB 1842 has diminished in quality as it is that others have caught up, nearly every dish save for the Pretzels available elsewhere either better, cheaper or both though  the service and setting both continue to set a high standard.
