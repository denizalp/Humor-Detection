I've been to this place a couple of times, mainly for team lunches, so I thought I'd review it this time.  When you walk in, you get that classy Asian vibe.   It's fairly upscale looking.  But the first thing I noticed was how few Chinese people there are.  I think I was the only one.  \n\nWe had the chicken lettuce wrap for the appetizer. The chicken was not as tender as some other lettuce wraps I've had, and the soysauce may have overpowered the taste of the chicken.  But it was edible.  I tried one of the lunch bowls: pepper steak.  It said it should by spicy, but I couldn't feel the spice.  The beef was cooked well, but they ODed on the sauce making it too salty.  \n\nI thought the dessert shooters were really cute.  It's a good portion for those who want to have some desserts but not overstuff ourselves after a heavy main course.  The tiramisu shooter isn't as good.  But then it's not expected to have a tiramisu flavor in a Chinese oriented place.  It tastes more like a tiramisu cake instead of the traditional soft and creamy tiramisu I'm used to at an Italian restaurant.\n\nWhat I do like about the restaurant is the different tea flavors you can choose from.  And they bring it out for you in a traditional Chinese\/Japanese like teapot to set the Asian mood.  It's a good alternative for a tea house. \n\nPf Chang's is good to have food for the people who like the Chinese-American fusion.  It may be a good place to start if you're scared of \"real\" Chinese food.  It's not a good place for authentic Chinese food.  And the price is more than I would pay for average tasting lunch.
