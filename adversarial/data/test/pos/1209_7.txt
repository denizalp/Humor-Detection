I like corn bread. The HOB corn bread is the best I've had....ever. And the honey maple butter thing with it....sheeee get out man! Now why don't they have this by where I live? Think I'll search for it now.\n\nOn this particularly insomnified night, I'm thinking of all the places I've eaten & Yelpin' 'em all from memory....testing, testing.....
