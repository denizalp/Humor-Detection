Food is very fried, which is not something I enjoy. \n\nThe salad bar appears unappetizing between the very soggy lettuce and the greyish eggs. \n\nI was very amused to see that they had A&E on their TVs after reading another review where they had brought their kids and had to watch one of the crime shows. We also had crime shows! That didn't bother us at all but I did find it amusing. \n\nOur server was very pleasant and we had a great time. \n\nThe decor is lackluster and the place was very empty. \n\nThe biggest factor in the low star rating was the food. It wasn't tasty and it stuck with me for a long time. It was not my cup of tea.
