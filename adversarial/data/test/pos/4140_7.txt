Okay so the only reason why they get 2 stars is because the server was nice. The food is overly salty and mediocre at best. There are plenty of better restaurants. We decided to order the white gummi drink. Basically you are paying $40 for candy and smoke. Didn't even get buzzed of this massive sized drink. I don't think there was an ounce of liquor in it. Totally not worth it. The place is super loud. It's had a feel of a night club.
