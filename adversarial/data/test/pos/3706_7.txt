Service and ambiance are spot on here. It takes a while to get a reservation because it's tiny - only 8 tables. So plan ahead. Even though it's small, there's enough space per table to have an intimate, private dinner. The ladies who run this restaurant are great fun, very engaging & they also clearly enjoy what they're doing. \n\nOur appetizer charcuterie and golden beets were amazing! They set my expectations really high for what was to come. Food is all prepared to order, so your table might expect dishes to arrive a few minutes apart. Start eating and don't wait! The entrees I tasted were all really good and clearly prepped with quality, fresh ingredients. Quite delicious but not mind blowing.  My sea bass was beautifully prepared and the blood oranges (which I thought were grapefruit as I ate it) were a perfect compliment. The tabbouleh at the bottom needed salt and maybe some herbs to give it a punch of flavor. The veal braciole my husband ordered was super tender but was served lukewarm and the pasta it was served over also needed more flavor. Our friend's World's Smallest Ham was the best dish I tasted and I'd give that 5 stars for stellar flavor and creativity. \n\nPrice points run around $40+ for entrees and extra for appetizers and dessert but it's BYOB ($5 corkage), so bonus is you can have amazing wine with dinner.\n\nOverall a really great experience I'd qualify as more of a special occasion spot.
