THE UP-SIDE:  An efficient, medium-sized airport.  It's not the prettiest airport in the world, but I have flown in and out of here at least 25 times in my life and never had any big delays, never had a bag get lost, and never had bad customer service.  In fact, the last time I traveled out of this airport, the people were so friendly it took me aback.  \n\nTHE DOWN-SIDE:  While the airport is pretty efficient and run by friendly folks, it can be a little rough looking; especially in the older concourses.  The food selection is also pretty limited.  However...  \n\nOther reviews here suggest that the lack of quality food at this airport is some sort of indicator that Cleveland natives are scary folk.  While I might take that stance for any number of other reasons (hey, I'm a Cleveland native!) I certainly wouldn't because of the airport food service.  \n\nThe food at this airport is definitely limited, but that's no indicator that the people of Cleveland are.  Spend a little time in Cleveland and I'll show you a host of places with good vegetarian choices.  Just 'cuz you don't dig the food choices at our airport doesn't mean we're all a bunch of dunderheads.\n\nTHE SUM-IT-UP:  It's just an aiport, folks.  As such, it's not here to make sure your educated palate is \"happy-happy!\"  It's here to provide efficient airline service; which it has done for me for over 25 flights and 25 years.\n\nPut that in your vegetarian pipe and smoke it!  Oh, wait.  That would be unhealthy!\n\n;-P
