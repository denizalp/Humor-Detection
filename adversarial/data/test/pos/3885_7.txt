I was absolutely BLOWN away by this church! \nFirst off, the people were so welcoming and so genuinely excited for us attending.\nSecond,  the children's center was very exciting for my kids. They came out very excited and asked if we could please come back again! \nThird, the praise and worship was phenomenal. I got chills immediately. The songs are relevant and so was the church. \nAnd last,  the preaching is absolutely amazing. Straight from the Bible but delivered is such a way that keeps you laughing and attentive. Pastor Benny Perez is so funny and raw! He is leading an amazing church along with his beautiful wife Wendy!\nI have not been so excited to go to church more than I have been after stepping out of The Church  LV!!! The spirit of God is in this place!!!!
