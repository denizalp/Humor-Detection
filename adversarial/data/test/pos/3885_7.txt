This was actually quaint and clean for such a small place. There are no coin machines though but there are plenty of small businesses around to go and get change at. There is a television in the back and places to sit in the front. The million dollar question we were asking ourselves was, why is there cup of noodle soup in the vending machine of a laundromat? There are no microwaves here people. What are you going to make soup in the washer?
