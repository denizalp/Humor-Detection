I've been coming to One Health Clubs since I was a kid back when it was the Fitness Institute.  Compared to what it was, the renovations have been great.  Everything is very clean and the wood finishes give that zen feel.  I agree it's been a pain while the fixes have been going on, but when are renos not a pain?  I don't think it's necessarily an indicator of how the club actually is.\n\nThe equipment is all new, and they have \"techno gym\" equipment that can be programmed with custom USB fobs that guide and track your workouts.  The gym also has a variety of classes from body sculpt to kick boxing to Zumba to hot yoga.  They have separate studios for group classes, hot yoga, spinning and kick boxing.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  They also have tennis and squash courts and a pool, so there are a lot of ways you can vary your work out.  The change rooms also have jacuzzi tubs as well as dry saunas and steam rooms. A Lettieri is on site, should you need a snack, meal, or java boost.\n\nThe only suggestion I would have is to have more classes after the 9-5 work day or on weekends.  The majority of the classes occur during the day or just before 6, so I can't make it unless I leave work early.  If not, I have to wait until the later classes around 8, and I prefer to get home sooner.
