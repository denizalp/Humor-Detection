Fried chicken is like a big titted white girl...I've never been disappointed after having one.  So to no one's surprise, I enjoyed Ajuker's fried chicken, however, it only gets a 3.5 star rating.  Here's why:\n\n+ Chicken is nice, crispy and moist, but it is no Bon Chon (not even close)\n+ Both the 'fried' and 'sauce' chicken are equally as good -- so go for the mulatto (half and half...this is NOT the actual menu name!)\n+ Venture to the bathroom for hilarious times (i.e. Korean lady sitting in the dark talking on her cell phone (WTF?), hand dryer outside of bathroom that shoots horizontally, etc.)\n+ Only a small plate of daikon?  No kim chi?  No rice?  Is this even a Korean restaurant?\n+ Suggest you get more than a massive plate of fried chicken -- you need some padding for your guts to handle all the meaty greasy goodness\n\nI would probably never go back to this place if we had Bon Chon in Toronto, but seeing as how we don't, I will likely go back again now that I am armed with an experience under my belt.
