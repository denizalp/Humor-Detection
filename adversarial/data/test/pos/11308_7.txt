Maximum Flavor Pizza is slightly falsely named.  Nothing here really has maximum flavor, but it is maximum cheap for the area.  I frequent Craig St when I am starving between classes, and Sophia H. and I tested this place out.\n\nI ordered a slice of pizza and jalapeno poppers, which came to a grand total of $5.58 with tax.  The slice of pizza was ok and super reasonably priced.  The poppers were not so good, and I would not order them again.  My recommendation is to stick to the slices of cheese pizza for a cheap and filling meal!\n\nService was a touch gruff on our visit.
