Ignore the butt-hurt morons who give 1-star reviews because they're so lazy they can't go another .5 miles to go gnaw on flesh at any other Chinese restaurant. \n\nThe wheat gluten used for the Tso's and Orange \"meats\" is excellent. The lemon \"fish\" appetizer surpasses any mock fish I've seen. Additionally, the \"cutlass\" appetizer mocked a fried chicken texture. I will be back to try the rest of the menu, but am pleased a place like this now exists in South Charlotte....or in Charlotte in general. If you've been to Harmony in Atlanta, it is very similar.
