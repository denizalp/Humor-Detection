We were the first to walk in the store this morning and my husband said hello and nothing.. she just looked at him.. when I saw that happen..I walked up to her looked in the face and said good morning and she barely even opened her mouth to say hello back. I did not even want to stay in the store but we were looking for something for our kids. We asked her if she had an item..she did not even look up from her computer and barely even said no. I was so furious I had to walk out before I had words with her or even threw one of the oversized gummy bears at her! I walked out of the store and with shaking angry hands I felt it was necessary to write this review. Stay away!
