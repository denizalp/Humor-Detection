When I am in Vegas for one of my, \"I have to get out of Milwaukee. I don't care where I stay!\", weekends, and I get free nights at the Strat, this bar is pretty nice. You can drink free if you play Video Poker or there are usually free drink coupons available from the front desk. One night I even met Tiffany and Danny Bonaduce(sp.?) here. Talk about a bizarre pop culture moment! There is a nice easy ramp for wheelchair access.
