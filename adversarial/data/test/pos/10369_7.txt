So I was heading to Vegas to catch a weekend of concerts at the T-Mobile Arena (you can check my other review about that). I wanted a cheap place to stay, that wasn't going to break the bank and also was kinda close to the action. I found a deal on Groupon for a stay at the Golden Gate Hotel and Casino. I'd never been, and the photos look pretty decent, so what the hell? I'll spin the wheel (pun intended).\n\nSo this baby is right smack dab at the start of The Fremont Street Experience. From the outside, you can tell this is one of those historic buildings. It's got a quaint, old-school Vegas charm about it ... kinda like seeing your grampa put on an oversize gold chain with his leisure suit and white shoes to impress his date at Sizzler.\n\nRight off the bat, the real star of this place is the people. You can tell some of these folks have been here a REALLY long time. Super nice, friendly, pleasant to talk with, and very helpful. I checked in, got my room key and headed up to the 3rd floor. One thing you'll need to know right off the bast, is there's the lingering smell of cigarette smoke .... everywhere. Now I had a non-smoking room, and truth be told, it didn't smell like smoke. But man, the elevator and hallways were pretty smoke-smelling.\n\nThe room itself was small. Really small, but very tidy. Forget about a 5-star experience ... this place is strictly utilitarian. The decor looks like it was updated in the last 20 years or so, but I'm pretty sure the room itself has been unchanged since the 1960s. The closet door was really small, but the interior of the closet was pretty big. The bathroom is tiny, and the tile work looks to be close to original. Think of this place as staying at your grandmas house, but with slot machines and go-go dancers. Which on second thought, might have made me want to visit grandma more than I did. But I digress.\n\nThe bed was comfortable, the pillows were okay ... more like giant marshmallows stuffed in pillowcases,  and the linens were clean and crisp. There was a chair, a, flat screen TV, and a window with a view of the rooftop and AC system. \n\nThe weekend I was there, it was hotter than hell in Las Vegas, so the first thing I do, is crank the AC down to cool off the room. Well, that really wasn't going to happen. I turned it down to 68, as it know that it will only get to about 72. Well this AC cooled the room down, but only slightly. I think it got down  to about 76 degrees in the heat of the day. See the picture I added of the thermostat.\n\nThe one thing I will say, one of the valet guys, Jon, was such a helpful person! Honestly, this cat knows where everything is, had the BEST suggestions on cool spots to eat, how to get places, what to avoid, ... the list goes on and on. Also, it should be noted that the guy was ALWAYS there ... he was there in the morning when I'd get my car, and then there when I came back late in the afternoon. I'm starting to think that he lives there in the back room!\n\nBottom line? This place is perfect if you are looking for a simple, clean place to crash when you are out doing other stuff in Las Vegas. \n\nSide note, you HAVE to get one of the alcohol-infused slushies outside the hotel at the start of the Fremont Street Experience. The best thing you can do on a hot day.
