I've had good experiences at other Steinberg locations before.  \nI was less than thrilled at having to come here, because its SO far from where I live and work, but alas, it was one of the only places I could go for a specific test.\n\nI arrived early this morning, an hour before my appointment time, and was called up right away. \n\nI was moved from one waiting room, to another, where I was called up to pay, (which, by the way, it was more than the amount I was told on Friday.  Thank goodness I brought extra money, or there would have been a problem.) and then to one last waiting room, where I was told to use the restroom.\n\nThey brought me back before my scheduled time, and started the test early.\n\nMitzi (I think that was her name) was absolutely awesome.  She was friendly, personable, and she didn't poke around while putting in the IV.  It was relatively painless, for having an IV put in.\n\nThe test itself was easy and painless, but long...but I knew that and was prepared for it.  \n\nThe only thing that could have made me more comfortable would have been another blanket, but I don't know if it would have interfered with the imaging.  \n\nAll in all, for imaging needs, I would still choose Steinberg over other options.
