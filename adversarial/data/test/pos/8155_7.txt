We came around 6pm for dinner and were seated fairly quickly. They have updated their menu several times since I first reviewed, but we are loving the new items on the menu! Flat iron steak and Hawaiian pork belly are now our latest favorites. As always we had beaucoup beef belly and it was delicious! Our server Ozzy was very tentative, remembered all our requests and checked back frequently. Definitely a spot that will continue to have our business!
