Easiest. Move. Ever.\n\nThe movers showed up on time, were friendly, considerate and fun. They were able to move my chesterfield and matching chair over the back deck of not one, but TWO apartments with ease. One fella even broke down and hulahooped in my empty erstwhile living room when he saw the hoop (and he was better than me!)\n\nThey had quoted me at three hours,  and since they were done in less time than that, I ended up paying less than expected (and you don't pay until EVERYTHING is off the truck and where you want it in your new home).\n\nI wont be moving house again without El Cheapo.
