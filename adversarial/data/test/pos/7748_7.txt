Nice clothes and service, high prices\n\nIf I could get my head around paying $60 to $130 for each shirt and pant, I'd rate this place four stars.  For me, the value scenario drops way down when I can buy three to four sets of name-brand workout clothes for the same price as one Lululemon set.\n\nStill, I really liked a polo on the rack and bought it.  Fabric feels great and the service ladies were exceptionally nice.  \n\nFunny thing is that while it's technically \"workout wear\", I'll likely avoid wearing the shirt to work out in.  At $80+ I'm even going to move around slowly so as not to sweat in it.  And I'll hand wash it gently. With Evian water.  And a brush made from virgin wool from a holy sheep.
