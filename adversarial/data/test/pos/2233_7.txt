I came here to drop of some toys for the Yelp's Toys for Tater Tots.  It was mid-afternoon and there were few people inside and two or three tables used on the patio.\n\nI ordered the chicken curry bowl for my lunch\/dinner.  My iced tea was brought quickly and was refilled without needing to ask.  The menu describes the bowl in this way:  Chicken and vegetables, slow-cooked in our scratch made coconut curry, served over steamed white or brown rice with our fiery carrot slaw.  The carrot slaw was not fiery to my taste but it did have some red pepper sesame oil poured on the carrot thins and it was very good.  You have the option of white or brown rice and I chose brown.  The curry chicken had a good curry flavor and the serving size was very generous.\n\nThrowing caution to the wind (when don't I?) I ordered dessert--the Simms Family S'more.  The menu describes it thusly:  ...this house favorite is made with layers of rich chocolate fudge, graham cracker crust, peanut butter and warm brownie, topped with a giant, fire-roasted, housemade marshmallow and crushed peanuts.\n\nThe s'more was OK but I'd get a different dessert the next time.  The chocolate was very good but the marshmallow was a bit of a challenge.  Since it's one thick piece of marshmallow, you have to attack it with your spoon, hold it up off the dish, and wait for the lower part to slowly drop away.  It was a bit of a challenge using just the spoon.  It was tasty but I never like fighting with my food.\n\nService was outstanding.  What would normally me a 3 star review earned the fourth star with the friendliness of the staff.  Although it was a rather slow time, I'm guessing it's generally that way.  \n\nClose to home and a good selection, I'll be back.
