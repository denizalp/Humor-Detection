Where isn't there an Exchange anymore? And how do they differ? Well, this one has a mediocre metal selection. Although I did buy a new Breaker CD, and I had no idea they were still making music. Kay was overwhelmed by their wall of video game titles. \n\nIf you don't think there are hipsters in the suburbs, you've never been to an Exchange outside of the city. This here one was well-staffed with them. Oh to be young, goofy, confused, and underpaid again. God bless 'em.
