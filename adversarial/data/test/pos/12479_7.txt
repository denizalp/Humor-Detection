This review will be ONLY for the newly dubbed poker room at Talking Stick Resort.  The new official name is, \"The Arena poker room at Talking Stick\"  Ta da!!!  They changed the name 4 days ago from the generic,(poker room), when they lifted into place a 3000 pound state of the art scoreboard with 16 big screen TVs and a 360 degree sports ticker.  Very impressive, guys!\n\nPoker began here in the spring of 1998 moving locations several times between their two properties until finally being placed in this new 4 diamond resort, Talking Stick (TSR).\n\nFrom its inception, this poker room quickly developed into the premiere place to play in Arizona.  I believe the main reason for its instant success was the foresight of management to hire many likable props and get all the high action from other rooms instantly.  Sadly, most of the nicest props are now gone, leaving only four as of this writing.  Some of the older ones that no longer have a badge still play there and, they are GREAT.  They still make the games fun and help the dealers when they haven't learned the rules.\n\nThe Arena poker room is sought out by visitors and locals alike and is a large, fun, well staffed place to enjoy poker.  The employees are friendly, well trained, and competent (most anyway) from the managers to the bus staff.\n\nThey get most things right with the notable exception of highly touted Players Reward Club which began on April  15, 2010 but, still  to this day, has players, dealers, and managers alike shaking their head in disbelief over this state of the art(???) product distributed by Amaranth Corp out of Ca..  It is by far the main criticism of the otherwise well run room two years down the road in this gorgeous new facility...  Every few weeks or so ,there is a NEW proclamation that it is NOW working but, I for one have stopped using it as have many others.\n\nThe food can be ordered table side and  ranges from steak to a very tasty Asian menu.  High quality and great service but, the prices have more than doubled on many dishes.  It's still a GREAT value just not as great as it was before.\n\nThis room has too many tournaments to list but you can play from $60 to $1000 throughout the year,  The players seem to love the tournament action here.  Unfortunately, the tournaments now often conflict with the live games on Saturdays and Sundays resulting in mass confusion, anxious players waiting to gamble and a sometimes disgruntled floor staff who through no fault of their own have to take the brunt of the whining.\n\nIf you play poker, THIS is definitely the place you wanna come,
