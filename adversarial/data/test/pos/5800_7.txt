Like a good joke (and some other things in life), I think the trick to Japonais may be in the timing. I apologize for my terrible short term memory, but I am pretty sure they have happy hour from approximately 5-8pm and then a late night menu starting at 10pm. So, if you happen to arrive between 8 and 10, you are going to resent all those people who timed their experience smartly and took advantage of the discounts. \n\nIf it is 8:30, you can probably hold off until 10pm. Call to confirm times!\n\nWe went during the not so magical 8-10pm period and sat in the lounge. I will say service (despite a delayed soup) was amazing. Everyone from the hostess to the manager to the server to the server assistant were attentive to our every need. \n\nHowever, the food was a tad disappointing on this evening. The robata\/grilled items were definitely the highlight. I would recommend perhaps sticking to a selection of robata and sitting in the lounge for a cool evening snack. We also had the calamari, which was super tender, large cuts of calamari, not the skimpy rings. I appreciate the quality of the calamari, but the beauty was drowned a bit in the heavy chili sauce. I might even suggest getting that on the side. I had a salad which was okay. The first bite was brilliant, but the more I ate, the more the citrus notes became a little too heavy. My husband did not adore his fish entree, and the pepper soup we sent back for being salty. They were incredibly kind about removing the soup, but it was still disappointing. Overall, the meal was okay, and at full prices, not quite the quality we had hoped for. \n\nStill, the service was perfect, and if we had caught either their happy hour or late night menu and got the items we knew were the stars, it could have been the perfect lounge bite for the evening.
