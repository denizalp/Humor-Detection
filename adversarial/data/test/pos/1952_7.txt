If I could zero stars for my experience, I would. I was casually looking at their wig selection when I had to practically beg for the attention of the woman I assumed to be the owner. She was brushing a wig's hair and rudely answered my question I had about the price of a wig. My friend then proceeded to ask another question and she snapped again. My friend decided that was enough and said let's go. I let the owner know she has the worst customer service and she proceeded to cuss at me and told me to \"get the fuck out of her store!\" Oh wow, first off all their wigs are cheap and nappy, their price points are all wrong, and their customer service will scare all their business away. I am sick of having to deal with the Asian ethnicity when buying my hair. They don't wear, know, or care about their products. I am appalled.
