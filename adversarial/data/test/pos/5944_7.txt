Well my friends, with great anticipation did I wait for Sushi couture to open, and how delighted was I to hear the great reviews my fellow yelpers have written about the place, was I ever excited to start off yom kippur by feasting on fresh sushi just around the corner from my place. Well, ill be finishing my dinner off with an amply topped slice from pizzaiola tonight. \n\nSuffice to say, this place has all the makings of something that could be great, but falls desperately short of anything faintly near a \"great\" sushi restaurant. \n\nThe  service here is horrible, and I give no clemency to the fact that the place has only been open 3 weeks. Seated quick enough, given a half filled glass of warm water to start the night didnt score many points. Miso soup, it was ok, but its miso soup. starter salad, comparably un enchanting. Ive walked by the restaurant countless times and seen the tasting menu special and really wanted to order it but was not really told about it and so thought it was off the menu. maybe thats my fault, either way. \n\nThe food, spicy tuna roll: yes maybe the fish was fresher then sushi on bloor, but it lacked a real zing, if i wanted a taka maki (tuna roll) i would have ordered one, not rolled very well and half of my order fell apart mid chopsticking. Onto the main, I ordered the chirachi as it seemed like an interesting way to combat my typical order of hamachi tako and snapper, boy was i wrong. for 13 you get 2 slivery pieces of maguro, three salmon, three chunky small pieces of what seemed to be seared ahi amd some stupid egg concoction and butter fish (the latter being exceptionally foul). \n\nThey put it on a bed of rice, what the hell am i supposed to do with a bed of oily sushi rice, make the damn sushi my self? A quarter handful of white raddish? wtf. honestly, what the fuck. To top it all off, that took 45 minutes.\n\n I was left sitting at my table after finishing the spicy tuna with an empty glass of water and an empty plate, albeit being passed by the busboy numerous times. Altogether, I really do hate giving such a low score to what could be a great restaurant, and if you check my record i typically only dole out 4s and 5s. but they really failed on every part, both service and food wise. \n\nI could have gotten a kings ransom at sushi on bloor or new gen or any of the other places. The decor is nice, but if im bringing a date to a place id like not to wait there for an hour to get the food, i only have 25 minutes of conversation material... STAY AWAY!!
