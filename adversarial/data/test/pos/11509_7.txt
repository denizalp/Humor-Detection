We don't make it up to High Street very often, but recently headed to Modern Margarita for a happy hour birthday celebration for a friend... We were seated in the back of the restaurant at a long high top table that was perfect for our group of 6.  \n\nDes was our waitress and she was attentive and kind.  Amongst the group, we shared chips, guac, salsa, wings, some quesadillas, some tacos, and of course... more than a few margaritas!\n\nIf you find yourself in the north Phoenix area seeking a casual atmosphere to hang and enjoy a few drinks and decent Mexican cuisine, look no further than Modern Margarita.
