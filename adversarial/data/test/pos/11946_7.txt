Like I like my chicken!\n\nOrdered:\n- Andy's Famous Sage Fried Chicken Benedict $18.99\n- French Tractor Scrambled $14.99\n- Orange Juice $6.50\n- Side of Country Potatoes $4.25\n- Peppermint Tea $2.99\n\nTina's Temptation and Tourism: \n- Super large portion can be shared! \n- The wait was only about 10-15 minutes so it wasn't too bad! \n- John was a very fast and a great multitasker (hopefully that was his name). It's the one that was on the receipt!\n- The food is priced fairly high, but I can see why.. their portions are large is an understatement. \n- This was featured on Man vs. Food! Layer of biscuit with tomato, spinach, smoked bacon, griddled mozzarella, and chipotle cream scrambled eggs with mash potatoes!\n- The crispy chicken is really good and fried for that good flavorful sauce they drizzled. I can't complain about anything except their mash potatoes could've been done better. It was quite clumpy. I guess eat your food fast or else it'll get soggy. \n- I'd go back if I were really hungry... this brunch\/breakfast was so massive!
