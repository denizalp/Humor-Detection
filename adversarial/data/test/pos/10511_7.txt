3\/2018 to 4\/2\/2018\nWe recently had a bad experienced with Mr. Bailey.  I heard him said to my daughter \" I will make you cry on your brown belt test day\". I ignored it for that moment coz I thought it was a joke.  Then the following week ,,I heard him say again \" I'm going to give you {my daughter} a hard time on your brown belt test \". As usual, I didn't think it was real so I ignored what I've heard.\n \nThen Saturday I picked up my kid and she looked so sad and teary. Later on, she told me that Mr. Bailey told her that \" if she doesn't test the day she is scheduled to, he will make it much harder for her.\"\n\nWe called Mr. Bailey and left him a message so we can talk to him about our concerns. Mr. Bailey called us back, as I was trying to explain to him our concerns he got upset and talked over me. He talked over us in an angry voice and would not listen to anything we had to say.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Bailey decided to kick out my daughter from karate because he doesn't wanna deal customer concerns and complaints. \nAs a parent I will never tolerate anyone who \"bullies\" my kid. \n\nMy points are:\nWhy did Mr. Bailey have to say such a harsh words to my 11-year-old kid that has no means to harm him?\nWhy does he have to \" BULLY\" my kid for his satisfaction ?\nWhy does a 50-year-old man have to fill my kid's minds with fear before her belt test in the future instead of encouraging her to practice more ?\nWhy can't he give the kids advice, encouragement and supportive words as a teacher? \n\nI will never give this place a rating the way Mr. Bailey  \"bullied my kid through harsh words\".  He doesn't listen to customers and takes them for granted
