Today was the best experience I have had so far at the Farmer's Market. The game plan for today was get there early to have more selection which seemed to work. Normally the veggies are picked over but today I had lots of delicious choices. Sweet gorgeous heirloom tomatoes, loads of  pretty purple Japanese eggplants,  and luscious herbs fresh and plants  with wonderful aromas in the air. I chose fresh corn for dinner , tomatoes, leeks and shallots. Plus a giant head of purple cabbage ..I am a sucker for purple veggies..good thing they didn't have any purple carrots I  would have bought them all.  They also had wonderful artisan breads , had to buy some and I am not a bread lover. They tempted me with cheese pepper bread, apricot walnut and earthy loves of sourdough.  Also bought most of the Meat Shop's bacon supply , sorry if you got there after 9 and it was all gone, I love me some bacon. I look forward to going back , it's always a bit different and I hope our local merchants , farmers, and chefs can make this thing a big success.  I thrilled that it appears to be getting bigger and better . Buy Local!
