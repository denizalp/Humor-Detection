Wow people have a lot to say about wax!  I'll keep it simple...this place keeps my undercarriage from looking like I'm smuggling a wild buffalo under it.  I have very little pain during and no irritation after.  While I don't always see the same person, all the girls I've had are friendly.  Somehow they make timid lil me feel perfectly comfortable butterflying my legs in front of a perfect stranger.  A bit of a drive for me but definitely worth it.
