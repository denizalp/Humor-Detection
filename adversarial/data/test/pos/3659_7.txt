\"People are strange when you're a stranger\nFaces look ugly when you're alone\nWomen seem wicked when you're unwanted\nStreets are uneven when you're down\nWhen you're strange\nFaces come out of the rain\nWhen you're strange\nNo one remembers your name\nWhen you're strange\nWhen you're strange\nWhen you're strange\"  ~~~Jim Morrison & The Doors\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=bE473XEGR8LAmZsMZUnIvQ\n\nBest show I've seen over the years!\nGoing into town, I saw a billboard advertising a Queen retrospective and was all excited.   Hmph.....old billboard.  But this psychedelic offering with The Doors put aside my disappointment .  Loved it.\n\nThere were two guys who had the right idea about viewing the show.\nThey laid right down on the pavement in the middle of the walkway.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=PpDB8ccNNiTgvKCUdaqj1Q\n\nGot some free Mardi Gras beads.\nEnjoyed some live music.\nHeld on to my purse tightly.\n_______________\nNovember 2015 visit\nWe must be getting mellow in our old age.\nSince we were staying at the Golden Nugget, we spent more time enjoying the Fremont Experience this visit.\nI was actually planning on zip-lining, but then saw this happen twice.  People got stuck up on the wire and had to be towed in.

It came out pretty good!  We're going to mount it right in between our sons' graduation portraits.  Hahaha!\nHeld on to my purse even tighter.
