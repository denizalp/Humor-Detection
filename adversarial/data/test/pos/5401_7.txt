Absolutely the worst hotel stay, name brand or not that I've ever experienced. If you're thinking of staying here, save yourself the money, headaches and lack of rest and simply stay at Days Inn, right next door (stayed there last year and ironically it was one of the better hotel stays that I've had). \n\nFirst off, when we checked in, our king size room was located on the 2nd floor. My wife prefers top floors so as to avoid the noise associated with people walking around on the floor above us. I asked about changing to a top floor room and was told that there were only rooms with two queen beds on the third floor. I'm not sure where hotels get their beds, but a king is not a king as the rest of the world knows it, and so it is with hotel queens. We certainly weren't going to be comfortable trying to both squeeze into a queen bed. In the end, we decided to risk the upstairs noise and stay with the king bed. \n\nOur room (211) was right above and to the side of the lobby. Our first impression of the room was \"where's the rest of it\". Our bedroom at home is quite literally larger than the entire hotel room. The hotel advertised itself as \"newly remodeled\". I guess this remodel only extended to the tile on the floor of the lobby. The interior of the room, specifically the furnishings was certainly dated. The small TV (CRT style, not LCD as one might hope to find in a newly remodeled hotel) sat directly on the low slung dresser -- far too low to be able to watch while relaxing in bed unless you sit up propped up with pillows behind your back -- but if that's your plan, be sure to bring your own pillows as the hotel only sees fit to provide four small throw pillows that act as bed pillows. These were overly soft and quite literally about 18\" square. No support whatsoever. Good thing my wife brought her own - too bad I didn't follow her lead. Want to know what's on TV? Start channel flipping as there is no program guide - either paper or on a TV channel. The hotel provides free HBO, but good luck finding out what is playing as the HBO program guide was from last month. At least we could see what we missed. \n\nThe bathroom lacks a sink and mirror as those amenities are out in the entry hall of the room. I'm not sure I like the idea of handling a bathroom door knob that was handled by others without washing their hands first (because you can't since there is no sink in the bathroom). There is a small table with two chairs, as well as a luggage rack and floor lamp, however utilizing either the rack or lamp renders one of the chairs unusable due to the overly cramped quarters -- we had to move the floor lamp into the entry\/sink area just to be able to use the chair (and of course put our luggage elsewhere while we used it). \n\nAs for the peace and quiet one would expect while \"relaxing\" at a hotel, forget it. Within 10 minutes of entering our room, it sounded like people were fighting and tossing furniture around in the hallway. I went out to investigate the noises and found four or five young men around the pool table that is right outside the door of the room, with two of them on the floor. \"We're in a wrestling team\" was their excuse. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would think wrestling should be done somewhere except the hallway of a hotel. As if that weren't enough, the front door of the building was poorly adjusted, and every time somebody would enter or exit, the door would slam shut and make a very loud noise. This continued well into the evening, making falling and staying asleep an arduous task at best. The icing on the cake was when the TV in the lobby was turned on at 7 in the morning with the volume blaring. At least due to the lousy acoustics of the lobby and the poor sound insulation of the room it seemed that loud. At any rate, it's pretty bad when the lobby TV and front door noises keep a second floor guest from sleeping. \n\nLastly, if you read this far and you still insist on trying this place out, make sure you check your billing detail when you check out. The room includes a safe, and you will be charged for it whether you use it or not. Now, if the safe is part of the room, just like the TV, air conditioner, fridge or microwave, why isn't it included in the room rate? When you check out, you will notice a $1.50\/night (plus tax) charge for the safe. If you object to the charge, they will remove it, but you'd be better off objecting to the imposed charge up front (in fact, the manager claims that guests are supposed to tell them that they won't be using the safe at check in -- that's assuming the guest gets the memo about the practice first). \n\nWould I stay here again? Yeah, right! I think not! Would I recommend it to my worst enemy? Maybe for the pleasure of knowing they will suffer, but even then I'd feel guilty. \n\nTwo words -- STAY AWAY!
