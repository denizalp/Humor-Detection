I'm a little disappointed in this place they're Tom Yum Soup smelled rancid and it had way too much going on. So many onions and other things I wasn't expecting from a Tom Yum Soup. The Beef sew yew  was too sweet and not savory and their pad Thai was decent. For how much I paid I expected to at least get a side order of steam rise with my purchase but didn't even get that. I'm gonna stick with LOTUS OF SIAM no one is as good as them.
