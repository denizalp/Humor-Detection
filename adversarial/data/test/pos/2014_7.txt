Had a great experience at Joey's - shops at Don Mills location. The atmosphere, service and food were all great. I was going with 3.5 stars but a ridiculously good Apple pie easily pushed the rating up to 4 stars (apple pie gets 6 stars). \n\nWalked in and was greeted immediately by the hostess. I didn't have reservations but was seated immediately. Our drink orders were taken quickly, followed by our food orders. We were asked multiple times if everything was to our liking. My beer was filled every time I could see the bottom of the glass (for those who know me - that's important). I didn't expect this level of service for a \"chain\".\n\nFood was good. We started with the Spinach & Artichoke dip - one of the best ever but was a little runny (but no impact on taste). I had the Peppercorn new york steak. Steak was average but served with a killer brandy and cream reduction which more than made up for it. It was served with a spring roll that was  stuffed with mashed potato. It sounds odd but was delicious. My dinning companion had the lobster ravioli which was just OK in my opinion. And I can't forget - homemade apple pie to die for. \n\nThe drink menu was average in my view. A few decent beer selections but mostly standards. Was not a big fan off the Muskoka Mad Tom IPA but enjoyed the Mill Street Tankhouse Amber ale. They had about 10-12 beers on tap. The cocktail special was Bellini's for $4.50 that night.     \n\nThe restaurant looks great, nice clean modern look. Lights are dimmed, a great date place. Prices were not unreasonable but slightly above average. My steak at $36 was a bit high given the quality. Drink prices were rather good. Getting to the washroom feels like climbing Mount Everest after a few beers. \n\nI will be back for sure. Although the food gets 3 stars, the service, atmosphere and  apple pie push my overall rating to four stars. I was there on a Monday so curious to see if the service holds on a busy Thursday-Saturday night.  \n\nOn an odd note, I was flanked by two separate mid-40 year old couples making out at their tables. What's up with that?\n\nBK
