Foxy is a classy low key restaurant in Griffintown. The restaurant is small and cozy so don't be surprised if you are seated at the bar, as this must make up 30% of the total seating in the restaurant. Foxy is not the place to come and be seen, it is the place to come and enjoy amazingly well prepared food. The menu is short and thoughtful. Each ingredient has been carefully selected and the result is amazing flovour in every bite. Everything is cooked in a wood burning stove or over a charcoal grill adding a wonderful flavour and aroma to the food and it should be noted an extra degree of difficulty for the chef.  \n\nWe've been lucky enough to eat here on a number of occasions now, and each time I feel that the food is better than the last. Then I think back and remember clearly how my mind was blown over the food the time before and in the end can never really decided which experience was best. \n\nA couple of visits ago I had messed up our reservation, I made it for the wrong week so the only place they had for us was at a small corner at the chef's bar. As it turned out this is one of the best seats in the house. We got to watch all night as Chef, Leigh Roper, ran her kitchen to precision, managing every order carefully and working shoulder to shoulder with her team over the open flame of the charcoal grill. It was a lot of fun to see and added a real level of appreciation for the work, and sweat, that goes into each and every plate. \n\nSome of our favortie things to order include, Starter: the flatbreads are mind blowing, last night we had to order a second of the tomato and mozzarella topped flatbread as it was so dam good,  home made feta; Mains: you must try the ribs and gnocchi; Side: be sure to order the yams with spicy mayo and the corn that we had yesterday was terrific. Really, no matter what you order you can't go wrong. Everything that we have had has been terrific. \n\nFoxy is definitely our favorite new spot! And a must for anyone who enjoys great food. Here are a couple of key points to manage your expectations:\n\n- Do expect to sit at the bar. It is a small restaurant and this is part of their core seating area (reservations are also highly recommend) \n- Don't expect a Griffintown party scene atmosphere;\n- Do expect to enjoy some of the best and most flovourful food around;\n- Do expect to spend your money, this is an expensive restaurant;\n- Don't expect enormous portions. Foxy is about quality not quantity;\n- Do expect to come home smelling a bit like a campfire (particularly if you are seated towards the back). The ventilation in the restaurant is excellent, as you don't notice any smoke while you are there, but they are cooking over an open wood flame so the aroma will linger on your clothing; and \n- Do expect to relax and enjoy! \n\nI'm honestly surprised to see that Foxy does not have an across the board 5 star rating on Yelp as it provides one of the best authentic quality food experience in Montreal,
