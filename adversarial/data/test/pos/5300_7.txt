Four of us ladies came for happy hour before going to a show at The Hale Theater. Sounded like a fun place with good happy hour options. \nBoth of their Redneck cocktails on HH were not available as they ran out of vodka. How do you run out of vodka?  So we ordered other drinks instead. \nWe ordered all 3 apps which were on HH special being the fried pickles, southern rings, and fingers & rings, also got the pretzel which wasn't a special. The food was highly recommended by the staff but in reality was quite underwhelming. The chicken fingers were flavorless, the rings were tasty, the smothered fries were ok, the pretzel was good but the cheese could have been better (a cheddar beer cheese would have been ideal), and the fried pickles were surprisingly spicy, those were good. \nThe service was mediocre. Have little intention of returning. Really had high hopes. Too bad.
