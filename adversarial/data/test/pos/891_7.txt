Came in here to buy a $200 power wheels for our son. We saw it online with a 20% off promo and was able to find it in stock at this store. We found TWO associates nearby the toy aisle who confirmed that we could get the online deal matched at guest services - they were kind enough to bring the toy to the front for us because it wouldn't fit in a shopping cart. \n\nAfter filling the cart with diapers and other baby items for our other son, we went to pay for the power wheels - but guess what? Guest services was not willing to match the online promo after TWO other associates said they would. No problem, we'll just buy it online and pick up in-store and be on our way right? WRONG! They made us wait for the ONE associate in the whole freakin store to come back from lunch to scan the damn thing just so that we could pick it up. I kid you not, we were at the guest service desk for nearly an hour just waiting for this person to come back from lunch. \n\nThe product was already pulled and sitting at guest services and there was nothing the manager was willing to do for us. She expected us to just sit there and wait for the inventory person to come back from lunch. We were already pressed for time to go home and feed our newborn and this was not helping. She was not apologetic at all and did not want to offer any compensation or anything. It was pretty much take it or leave it! Other Targets hand out $5 gift cards for inconvenience, this one makes you wait for their workers to come back from lunch break. \n\nAre you kidding me? We've spent thousands of dollars at this place and even drive past another Target just to go to this one. If I wanted this kind of crap service I would have just gone to Walmart. At least their lower prices make up for their crappy attitude. What's your excuse?\n\nTry waiting for a waitress to come back from her lunch break before she serves you food and let me know how you feel about it. Your store manager will be getting a call from me.
