Who would have thought that such a hole-in-the-wall spot in a semi-suspect location would have such great food?  Luckily, my fellow yelpers pointed me in the right direction, since I never would have stumbled upon this gem on my own.\n\nSince I was dining with a group, I was able to sample a wide variety of items, and my stomach was so happy for the variety.  The many appetizers I tried were delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the papaya salad, Thai toast, and fried tofu bites.  For dinner, we had the veggie curry and pineapple fried rice.  Both were delicious, well-seasoned, and made perfect leftovers the next day.\n\nDespite the drive, this has moved into the top spot on my Thai take-out list.  Be sure to be patient if you come with a large group - there is only one server and one cook.  However, if you don't mind a leisurely pace (and perhaps refilling your own water), the food will make you smile!
