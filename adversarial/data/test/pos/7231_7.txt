I did my research on Yelp before I went and took a tour.  And everything that was written on Yelp was 100% accurate....the facility is not well-maintained.  Fingerprints all over the glass windows like they hadn't been wiped down in months.  When the guy giving me a tour offered me the option to check out the women's locker room I took it upon myself to get some live testimonials and ask a few ladies in there what they thought of the gym.  Slick, eh?  One of them mentioned that the water fountain had been broken and it took the staff a few weeks to fix it.  Weeks?  Three ladies all gave me an, \"it's ok for the price\" response.  They pointed out a locker that was hanging off the hinges, broken, and some unfinished areas in the locker room.  They said stuff like that goes unaddressed for long periods of time.  There were a few machines that weren't in working order.  What *really* stood out to me was the fact that there were weights, mats, empty water bottles etc. laying all around the gym.  So that tells me two things...the people that go to this gym don't re-rack anything (which is bad enough because it's discourteous to other gym-goers), and that the staff doesn't do anything which is worse.  This is a big place and it could be SO MUCH better if they took care of it.  It felt like a really run down and tired Bally's Fitness (even though I know it used to be Urban Active), and I didn't feel good when I was inside the place.  I left there and drove down the road, took a tour of Lifetime Fitness, and bought a membership there.  That place is the Rolls Royce of gyms in the area.  So for the $35 per month LA Fitness quoted me it was a no-brainer to go to Lifetime and pay the $75 per month to go there just to be in a cleaner, newer gym where you feel good in the environment.
