Steve Wynn definitely has great taste in decor. It's a shame that he is slowing getting blind. This masterpiece hotel is a sight to see from the fountains to the flowers on the ceiling, expect to be captivated the first time you see these classics.\n\nThe casino is huge and still smells fresh, not like other hotels on the strip. \n\nBeing owned by MGM now, it's been renovated and its beauty and charm still shine through. \n\nGetting to the hotel and casino is difficult as people are always crossing on the crosswalk at a busy intersection but you'll get passed it.\n\nThe rooms are comfy and spacious.\n\nBe sure to book a suite overlooking the fountains! You'll be entertained for hours when the show runs. \n\nLots of whales come and go and you'll run elbows with them on Baccarat or Pai Gow. Just don't mess up their okay! Lol \n\nCan't wait to get back and enjoy their dim sum or club at the bank!
