I went there today to pick up our pottery for Father's Day. One of the pieces was all messed up with black smudges on the front and bottom. It was my daughter's father's day gift to her Dad. The high school student that was in charge there said, \"sorry human error\" as though that's suppose to make it all right. They gave me a pass for free studio fees and a certificate for $10.86. The studio fees and the certificate means squat. She had no empathy for the fact that my daughter took to paint this gift for her Dad. As though I care to go back there again? What rubbed me the wrong way was being treated like one of her high school friends. She didn't have enough respect to address me in the proper manner. I get that she's young and inexperienced but her repeating over and over again \"it's human error\" obviously just made the situation worse. I have had several birthday parties for my daughter over the years. It's not my favorite place to have had a birthday party, it's always so hot in there. But this now seals the deal for us to no longer give them any business. I do not care to go there and be treated with such disrespect.\nJust read other yelp reviews; they are all consistent with the same lack of regard for how they handle their product. Shame on them for this happening so often!
