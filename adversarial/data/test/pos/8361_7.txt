I've been here a few times for diagnosis and estimates for my aging Honda CR-V. I haven't had to have any repairs done here yet, but when the time comes, you can bet your sweet ass I'll be coming here. \n\nSo the first time I came here was a year and a half ago when my air conditioner exploded during the Summer. They gave me a much lower estimate than what Showcase Honda gave me, but I was able to get Honda to cover more than half the cost of it since it was a common issue and my car had reasonably low miles, but the catch was that I had to have it done at Showcase Honda (or an authorized dealership). \n\nThe next issue happened the other day when my car wouldn't rev past 2500rpm and the engine light came on as I entered the freeway during rush hour. I took it to Showcase Honda again because they were close to where I was. I was way overdue for an oil change, so I asked them to give me an oil change and check the computer to let me know what the error code is for my check engine. It was late, so they would tackle this the next day... \n\nI started doing research while I was waiting to be picked up, and it turned out to be an easy repair if it was what I thought it might be... I went back inside and told the service guy not to fix it - just give me the code. I was planning to either fix it myself or take it to Hon-Man regardless of what they said it would cost. Got a call the next morning from Showcase giving me the error code and telling me it would cost nearly 400 bucks to repair. I told him I would pick it up that afternoon or the next morning.\n\nI did some more research on the code they gave me and the internet said it was common to trip this particular sensor if you were low on oil or had dirty oil. I called back and told this to Showcase and he said that it's super rare and that he's only seen it happen in extreme cases when the oil is super dirty. I asked if they tried revving it again or if they drove it after doing an oil change and asked if my oil had been low or dirty. He said my oil was fine and that they revved it and it was still having the issue. \n\nIf I was a stupid dummy, I would have just said \"go ahead and fix it.\" This is how Showcase makes their money. Unnecessary repairs. I'm seething about that place, but I won't talk about it here... I already gave them an earful (and I think there are still some people there with some scruples, but many without). \n\nAnyway, I go to pick up the car, and it's fine. They left the check engine light on for me (because they wanted to extort another 60 bucks out of me), but the car runs fine. I drove it over to Hon-Man, and they looked at it immediately and turned off the check engine light and listened to the engine and such. They gave me sound advice, set up a paper trail on me this time, and didn't charge me a dime. (my favorite part was when he was taking notes in his computer on my recent car issue, he wrote \"car was running like shit.\" and then put down the proper codes and whatnot. I laughed.) \n\nIt's entirely possible the problem could come back - if it does, I'll be coming here to get it fixed. The night before, they had quoted me over the phone the cost to fix it and they came in under 200 bucks - half the price of Showcase for the same exact job. Not only that, but the guys here are all cool and nice and fucking honest. \n\nThat's the most important thing - they are honest. This place is hard to find - there's not really a sign out on the street that I could see - you just have to know where it is. In spite of this, it seems to always be pretty busy and they are more or less by appointment only, but they don't have to do unnecessary repairs to get that way. \n\nWhen your car breaks or something goes wrong or it starts running like shit, it's never a good time. You start to stress about money or how you're going to get from appointment A to obligation B. Then you start to stress over where to take your car - who can fix it - who isn't going to rip you off... It can be intimidating going to a repair shop and being at the mercy of someone with more technical expertise than you. That's not the case at Hon-Man. These guys are definitely experts, but not intimidating at all. They are simply awesome and trustworthy. I'm never taking my car anywhere else.
