This is one of the worst starbucks I've ever been to.\nY'all that work here- you're rude. \n\nNow.. I can't be like \"omg I'll never go again\" because it's the only starbucks on campus and there are just those early days where you need a nice tea or coffee.. and timmies doesn't cut it. The workers here are impatient and 80% of the time, they don't really understand what you want without you repeating yourself slowly. \nThe gold card system is messed and they don't have a scanner like all the other starbucks. That's why the workers (distressed students and old filipino ladies) get pissed because they need to manually type in the number, when you're paying from the app. \n\nMy drinks are ALWAYS messy when they hand it to me, with sticky liquid dripping down the side or the top not being on properly.. I don't think they realize this drink is worth half an hour of minimum wage in Canada- at least you can make it presentable?..\n\nOne time, this girl that was waiting for her drink asked \"did you make it with soy? I asked for it with soy because I'm lactose intolerant\" and the worker barely looked at her and said \"nope because we charged you for regular milk\" and shut the conversation down. RUDE. That poor girl probably couldn't finish her $5 drink without a few trips to the bathroom. Honestly, any other starbucks would've fixed that error. \n\nI come here probably once every 1-2 months and still, that's too much. Must.. stop.. supporting..
