Kosher Pigswich with Dickfries and Ballzslaw!!!\n\nLadies and Gents, to comprehend what I am about to lay upon you I feel it's only right that I paint a picture of the womb from whence it came.\n \nWelcome to Da Burgh, Ahhrn City --An old east coast city in Southwestern Pennsylvania, situated on the hills and valleys carved out by the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela.  It rains a good deal here.  The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked their asses off in the steel mills years ago.  Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough blue-collar charm.  People here are genuine, love their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular with middle-aged men with last names ending in \"ski\".)\n\nOnly out of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary food.\n\nA Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french fries are put on top, and then sweet & sour slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  The entire creation is plopped down flimsy piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  It's a huge toppling sloppy mess.  The only way to fit the damn thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite in.  Whatever your modus operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.\n\nIf you're having trouble visualizing this, check out their website. Besides their city menu has the #2 best seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely no mention whatsoever of the #1 or #3? primantibrothers.com\n\nThe true yinzer sandwich option that I recommend is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  The Kolbassi is split open and dropped into the fryer.  Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold ahhrn city, en'at.  (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold Iron City Beer and that.)\n\nPrimanti Bros. is definitely not diet food, but most definitely a 100% genuine Pittsburgh food.  It is disgusting in all the right ways.\n\nI leave you with the apt lyrics of South Carey. \"Where they don't pour steel, but the kids are real. But why do they all have beards (beers)? It's Pittsburgh, Go Steelers Pittsburgh.\"
