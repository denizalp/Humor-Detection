I like that this place is close to home. From what I can tell, everything is sterilized and they have a lot of assortment of nail polish to choose from. I particularly liked this girl named Nancy. She did a really good job with my manicure and pedicure. The owner (the lady) she does a really good job on acrylics...lots of nail art too! Its about 40 bucks for a mani and pedi. I don't really like asian owned shops, but this one I will go to when I really need a mani\/pedi ASAP.
