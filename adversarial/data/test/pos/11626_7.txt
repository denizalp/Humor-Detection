Awwwww shoeeeeeeeeeee... t! \nYelp comes through again!\nThat's right folks, the site most known for it's rave restaurant reviews and rad recs for retails can indeed guide you to awesome services right in your backyard. \nI was packing last Thursday and realized I had some pretty scuzzy looking shoes (thanks winter) and without anytime to wash and polish them up, I decided to scour the interwebz for somewhere close to home that could spiff 'em up for me. As luck would have it this place has some solid reviews and is two minutes from my place. They have wonky hours because they have a boatload of work, but I was able to drop everything off Thursday and pick them up late on Friday... WHAT?! That's right, even as busy as they are, I told them I was getting on a plane Sunday morning and needed my kicks fast. Whelp, they were able to accommodate me and for that I'm grateful. \nI'm tramming around SF right now in my rad looking chukkas (instead of the 9 inches of snow that awaits my return) and I have to say, they look pretty damn good. Boots, leather, suede they can (and did) do it all! \nThanks folks!
