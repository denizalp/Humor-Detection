Definitely one of the few hold-overs from Vegas' early days, Harrah's accommodations exude a chintziness on par with, er, say, Reno as a whole.  BUT, you get Vegas play at Reno prices... so...\n\nThe Room.  Barest of necessities.\nDon't bother unpacking, awash in tan and eggshell blah, the feel of the room really exemplifies the idea that you probably won't be spending much time in it.  The other amenities cater to your basic needs.\n-  First there's the bed.  A strange non-conforming size\/dimension that looked like a queen in width, but seemed a bit short in length; I'm only 5'5\", anyone taller than me and I'm sure you're footsies would be hanging over the edge...\n-  The Bathroom is vanity free, simply a counter, sink, mirror, throne, and curtained bath\/shower.\n-  There is also a TeeVee in the room, atop a television cabinet\/dresser.\n-  And that d@rned mini-fridge stocked with junkfood and liquor.  The type of looming temptation and convenience that is guarded by a little sign that reads \"Items Removed will be AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED to your bill\".\n\nThe Casino.  Old timey gaudiness.\nThe gambling at Harrah's is unglamorous gambling for gambling sake.  No Aristocrats with slinky dressed arm candy, no tie-n-slack'd young entrepreneurs whittling away at their venture capitol, no starlets or athletes.  Just gamblers.\n\nDaphne, you cold-hearted, unyielding, never-crack-a-smile yotch of a dealer!!  The table was hot!!  The six of us were on a rhythm, boisterous, drunk, having fun!  Then you came along and droughted us!  I was up $80 when I lost 10 hands to you.  WHO THE *EFF* LOSES 10 PAI-GOW HANDS IN A ROW?!  You and your black magic!  D@RN YOU!\n__________________________\nFive engineers and a lab tech with a penchant for MacGuyver and Indiana Jones can defeat the mini-fridge... but we've got nothing on Daphne, the 7-card fun killa!
