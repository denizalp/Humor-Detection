This vegan restaurant will satisfy health conscious diners with a wide selection delicious appetizers, smoothies, and entrees. This place has been in my bookmarks for months. One visit led me to ask myself, \"what took you so long\"? This is clean eating at its best. I ordered the tahini soba salad. This seasonal special features soba noodles, edemame, red cabbage, shredded carrots, cucumbers, nori paper, and dried lotus root. It comes with a tangy tahini dressing. I left feeling satisfied. The cost is a bit high, but the quality is worth it.\n   They give some thought to ambiance also. There is nice mellow insturmental background music and an eclectic decor. I particularly liked the decorative pillows displayed on one of the booth benches.
