I mean, I can dig it. It's a gym, its cheap, its convenient. There's usually a treadmill available for me to use. Staff is pleasant  enough.  I do wish i could put my hair up in a bandana tho. And that out of all the 24 hour news channels out there they didn't decide to ONLY show the Fox  News Channel. Fair and balanced my ass. While it gives me something to laugh at while working out, that selection bothers me and makes me question what kind of people own the place.
