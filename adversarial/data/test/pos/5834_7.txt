Let's hope you really like Pilsners because that's all they have here. Yes, just a Pilsner. No, not several types of Pilsners. One Pilsner. No, for real. They have one beer and one beer only. You can't roll in and get a flight. You can roll in and get a Steam Whistle Pilsner.\n\nOk, hopefully you understand what's happening here. For them to only have a Pilsner I'll say it's a damn good Pilsner. It's clean, crisp, and refreshing and I appreciate that they don't try to dry hop it or wet hop it or add Azzaca or Motueka or blah blah blah hops. It's just a legit Pilsner. They also have food but I didn't try any of it.\n\nVery cool place to hang out and get a beer (Pilsner) either before or after the game.
