Gabi K and I happen to be \"ladies who lunch.\"\n\nArcadia Farms is THE perfect location for ladies who lunch, as it turns out...\n\nA perfectly made pitcher of iced tea, an heirloom tomato salad with mini mozzarella balls and sweetly poised basil. VERY good. Everything on the menu was quite tempting, including the desserts that greet you upon entering. EVIL tactics. \n\nFor a moment in time, we were those lucky ladies. I just need more jewelry, and a better car. ;)
