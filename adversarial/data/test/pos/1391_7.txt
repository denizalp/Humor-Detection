I'm very surprised that Cibo has such a low rating. The place has a fantastic ambiance, the service we got was great, and watching the girl swing around to retrieve bottles of wine was a unique experience!\n\nI wasn't particularly hungry, so I ordered a board and shared the Tiramisu, both of which were presented beautifully. The bread, olives and peppers that they bring out before the meal were also a highlight (particularly the peppers!!)
