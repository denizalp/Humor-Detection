My favorites are the 'carrot,apple, raisin' muffins and the red velvet cupcakes... mmm... my mouth is watering just thinking about them!  There is also a 'Wicked Little Dog' line coming soon!\n\n#2 - Wicked will be a hit at any party!  I recently brought a couple of dozen cupcakes with me to a party and they were the center of attention - I felt bad because it took away from the birthday girl!  The presentation is amazing... I tried the neapolitan retro cupcakes and the chocolate molten for the first time... to die for!  Nationwide Shipping available too...
