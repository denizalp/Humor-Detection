Was hungry and finally decided to try this place out. It's a little confusing when you walk in and look at the board because they don't have prices next to half the items, so you search until you get to the bottom that says \"two combo deal $8.99\". Which means you can have a sandwich plus soup, or plus salad, or soup and salad. Just weird in my opinion. Also drink prices are not listed, in fact after I got and paid for an apple juice I didn't even know they had a soda machine hidden behind the techy wall. Of course I have no idea what a small, medium or large would have cost me. Strange layout, almost need to have come before to understand it.\n\nI opted for the ham bacon club, and a bowl of lobster bisque. Both were actually pretty tasty. I didn't taste much bacon on the club, but the honey mayo mustard sauce was good. The lobster bisque wasn't bad either considering, its not top quality restaurant good but decent enough. Overall, a tasty meal for $11.31.\n\nStaff was friendly and bubbly, not sure if it was lunch or a shift change of many of the employees were eating at the same time I was. Rest of the place was pretty quiet at 2pm.
