Wow, I never knew this place even existed!\n\nGlad to have stumbled upon this place with my group of friends. It was a Friday night for my friend's birthday and they had a reservation. The owners and workers were super nice and helpful! The rooms were super clean as this is a no smoking facility. They serve food and alcohol and they always checked up on us. \n\nFor the price and quality, you can't go wrong. I think this is the best karaoke place I've been to in Vegas. Make sure you call and make a reservation before you go!
