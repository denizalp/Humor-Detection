After walking up and down the strip, we were a bit hungry and since my finacee has never tried this place out, I suggested she give it a try. I have had WC and Krystle before, so I knew what was in store for me. Mini burgers served in packs with fries and soda. It's a pretty simple meal.  \nThe lady behind the counter (wish I had gotten her name) was extremely courteous and appreciative of her job. She was telling us how another location just opened up in DTLV and how she was assisting there too. Though tired, she told us how she's thankful for the work and happy to serve the customers providing her and her coworkers jobs. I always have an appreciation for people who appreciate the opportunities given to them.\nWe ordered the special at the time which was Jalepeno sliders with spicy jack cheese and regular cheese burgers. It's more a place to give it a shot, but don't expect a mind blowing, fine dining burger experience. We also upgraded our fries to loaded fries which was worth it. It is connected to the casino, which was surprisingly not bad considering you'll normally be exposed to the stench of cigar\/cigarette smoke which was not an issue when I dined here. The dining area, along with the soda fountains were  kept up well as there was plenty of foot traffic in and out of this particular WC.
