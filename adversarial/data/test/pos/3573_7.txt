I'm officially a Drybar whore. I can't stay out of the place. I recently became the mayor on foursquare and was slightly horrified to realize it was the 3rd time I'd been there in a week lol Sure, sometimes they run a bit late or whatever, but overall I've had a consistently great experience.\n\nI love the atmosphere, the drinks (mimosas if you like. me likey), the girly movies, its ALWAYS clean which is important to me and I have a favorite girl to go to (can't tell you who it is and have her get all booked up :) \n\nI thoroughly enjoy popping in first thing in the morning and having fabulous salon-looking hair all day, its a treat and I love it! The women who work there are very friendly, I'm always in and out in an hour and they have my card on file- I just tell them to charge it, they email a receipt and I'm out the door. They are even super sweet and attentive when I occasionally have to bring my baby boy- that gets them extra bonus points.\n\nlove it! Drybar, I want to work there, I want to own one, I want to whisper sweet nothings in your ear. I feel like I'm cheating on my husband, good thing there is no receipt to bring home or he'd probably kill me lol
