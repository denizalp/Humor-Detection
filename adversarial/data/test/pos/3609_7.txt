Stopped by the other day for a quick togo drink.  I ordered the \"My Favorite Carrot Juice\" which had been hyped on my first visit.  At first, the drink was nice and carro... wait a minute... did a baby just vomit in my mouth?  Seriously, the food I had here was great and every other drink is good, but every sip of the carrot juice felt tasted like my body was rejecting a stomach transplant.  \n\nJust don't get the carrot juice.  I don't know how they can drink that stuff.
