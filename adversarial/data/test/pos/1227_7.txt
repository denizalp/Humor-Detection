My hair lady just moved to Phenix and I was not sure I wanted to drive farther but I love Honii B. So I had to give it a shot.  I love her new room!  Glad she moved.  The fact that everyone has their own individual suite that is decorated to their own style is pretty cool.  You don't get the liveliness of an open salon, but it is nice and private if you like that.
