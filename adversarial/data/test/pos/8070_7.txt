Yes, this place is huge but you still need to call ahead because they are busy. ( even at 5:00!) They don't take reservations for parties under 6. Parking lot is large so, no problem there. \n\nBest German food I this area, for sure. We had to wait for our table so we had the sausage appetizer at the bar; bratwurst,  veal sausage, and knot wurst I had the potato pancakes, light and fluffy-red cabbage slaw and potato salad. My husband had the wiener schnitzel and the whole basket of the pretzel rolls.  \n\nMy husband joined the beer club-$30 and a stein. They have a club that meets on Tuesdays with a $6.95 buffet. And .50 off beers in the stein. We plan on trying that and the Sunday buffet the other Yelpers mentioned.
