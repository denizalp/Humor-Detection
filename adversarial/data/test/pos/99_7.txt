If I were to describe it in one word: EEWWW. I went there with 2 other young very attractive women. They wanted to charge us 20 something bucks to get in. If this was a classy nice place that would be one thing but it was a scetchy shut hole and the creeps crawling in and out while we stood there contiplating if we should pay that much to go in were enough to send us running back to the strip. It's a shame Vegas doesn't have a decent lifestyle club. Anyway, ugh this place was so gross.
