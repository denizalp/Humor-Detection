Customer service has really gone down. My family has been coming to this theatre for a while, and the last few trips were disappointing, but nothing compared to tonight..\nDue to traffic, we walked in right at the time the movie started (Monday, 5:30 showing) but figured we'd make it to our seats after the previews. It was dead, so we walked right up with no line to purchase tickets. No problems there. Go to concession stand, only one cashier but only one family checking out. Aside from the cashier being EXTREMELY slow, she decides to chit chat with them for a few minutes. Literally, we stood there a good 6 minutes AFTER they had already been there, so they could finish their convo. Takes about 15 seconds for her to recognize our presence and call us over. We ordered a medium popcorn, hot dog and large soda. She ended up charging us for a meal, which was a LARGE popcorn and drink, yet only gave us the medium. Didn't realize until later. The guy assembling the popcorn was so incredibly slow, I almost couldn't believe it, taking his sweet time, in between each butter layer. She went over to put the toppings on the hotdog, and was so incredibly slow, putting on each jalapeno wheel ONE at a time with ONE hand, we were seriously starting to wonder if we were on a hidden camera show. We walked in the door at at 530, took us about 2 minutes to get the tickets, and didn't get to our seats until 550!! Keep in mind, everything we ordered was already prepared!! On top of that, we asked for extra butter on the popcorn, and there was barely any, so not sure what he was doing those 50 trips to and from the butter machine. Also, the popcorn was stale and probably from the night before. I think we ate maybe a quarter of it. The movie (Resident Evil) was good, but probably would have been better had we not missed the first 20 minutes of it. For as much as they charge for everything, this is unacceptable. We drop at least $60 every time we go, plus we live on the other side of town. We will not be returning. (The only reason i give it 2 stars is because we had enough points to get one pass comped. Clearly wasted.)
