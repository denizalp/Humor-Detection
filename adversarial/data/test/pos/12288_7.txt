They just opened. You can't see it off the street, they say they are getting a sign. Phoenix Coffee is always at the top of my list. The atmosphere is relaxing, free WiFi, and this location is nice. Customer service is great.\n\nOnly problem I have is if you dine in its same price refills!!!! Starbucks charges .50 no matter the size.... c'mon phoenix!
