I was waiting for Lab Corp to come back from lunch so I went to Yelp to see what was good to eat in the area. When I seen there was an actual Seafood Place that didn't cost an arm and a leg I hurry up and go there. The atmosphere was excellent. It was quiet (minus the normal table chatter)..very clean with a Back East Feel to it!! I love how the menu is on the board and what I really love is how they wrap your food up in Butcher paper yet it looks like an average to go box. Now the food.... I ordered the Lunch Special and that was 2 pieces of fish some homemade coleslaw and a large drink. They make homemade tarter sauce and Slaw and that tarter was so good I could drink it by itself!! The Onion Rings are freaking amazing and the batter they use is something out of this world. To be honest..it taste like some old family recipe from Wales, London...lmaoooo I am totally hooked and the staff was so cool it feels like I have known them for years. This is a really great place and its worth driving out of the way to taste their Fish or Clams....or hell, they can deep fry my house-shoes if it means I can have more of that batter and Tarter sauce.\nAlso I met a really Wonderful Man while I was having lunch...I think he said his name was Bo Olsen but I could not find him on FB!!  If you see this Bo, Please leave a message about this place!! You never know...We may have our Wedding here..LMAOOOO\n-KK
