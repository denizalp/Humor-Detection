The sign said CUPCAKES $3,, I had to stop by and get me one! I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake, that had a beautiful cream cheese frosting with a dusting of iridescent sprinkles and topped with a little pink dot! So cute yet had to be eaten!   The cupcake tasted as good as looked! I hate when you buy something pretty for it only to be dry and tasteless, but that's not the case here!! I look forward to trying out other cupcakes soon! Also found out that everything coming from Superstition Farm, I just love when local ingredients are used! \n\nLook forward to my next trip!
