Dark woody atmosphere, overly pricey drinks, bathrooms that are smellier than they should be, lots of older dudes with expensive unbuttoned shirts on, and unfortunately 2 TVs playing CP24 that take away from the cache. I think I had a good time here even though that description was pretty bad. \n\nWould be a nice place for a date, I think.
