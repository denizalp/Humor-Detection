We met up with some friends recently at Angels Trumpet and had a blast!  It was packed out, but we were able to get seats at one of the shared high-top tables, which is always fun since you never know who you'll end up chatting with.  If you're on a date and looking for exclusivity, it's probably not ideal, but it's always entertaining to start chatting with your fellow diners about whether they would recommend the food they're currently shoveling down their throats in an attempt to escape your rowdiness.\n\nThere's a killer beer selection and a surprisingly good couple of wines as well.  We also devoured a set of wings (highly recommend) and the tractor pizza (eggs, bacon, brussel sprouts - weird but tasty).  We could have split a single dish, since the pizza ended up being much bigger than we expected, but we just pigged out instead.  We also tried some of the homemade poptart of the day, which sounds weird and a little gross (if you remember what poptarts usually taste like) but which was actually an incredible dessert.\n\nDefinitely recommend Angels Trumpet as a chill place to meet up for a beer or two.
