Only been here for weekend brunch but the food is always really good.\n\nService is a bit ditzy (hey when you bring me milk packets for my tea can you not just drop a handful on the table from 5 feet like I'm a chicken?) but what can you do.\n\nMy wife was pretty annoyed at the place last time we went but that has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, we were just seated next to a screaming, anxious, ADD-riddled 6 year old who liked to climb all over her mom and my wife's jacket and scream nonsense for an hour.\n\nAwesome.\n\nAnyway prices are fair, food is consistently good (for brunch anyway, dunno about the rest), and I will be going back if I can convince the wife this place isn't a baby-fest.
