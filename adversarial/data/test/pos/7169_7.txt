I'm really confused by what this restaurant is trying to be - Mexican? Tex mex? A steak house? A seafood restaurant? Italian? It's all over the place! While the ambiance is nice and service is good, the food in my opinion was just okay despite a pretty big menu. I tried the carne adovada and it was way too spicy and practically inedible. I left most of my meal untouched. Nothing in its description made me think it would be ridiculously spicy. I also tried the cheesecake and creme brûlée desserts. The cheesecake was weird, not the traditional type but more like a whipped cream and it was too sour. The creme brûlée was just ok. This unfortunately is not a restaurant I would come back to.
