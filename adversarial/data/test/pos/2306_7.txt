Yeah I live in Gastonia. It's quiet and it's cheap and I'm from Texas, so I don't mind commuting to Charlotte. But my job now requires me to work nights and there are few places to eat in Gastonia after midnight. \n\nWhich is how I found myself at Applebee's. \n\nSo, any restaurant in Gastonia gets extra weird on the weekend, when the yokels 'come to town' for a night out. Believe me, you will see some characters. \n\nLet me preface, this isn't a review for Applebee's. This is a review for Friday night at Applebee's. \n\nThe food is just as shitty. But the entertainment is top notch.  Sleeveless hillbillies, Dungeon and Dragon players and all manor of douche bags complain about slow service, sing along to Katy Perry on PA system and gorge themselves on all you can eat fries.\n\nI really must remember to get something to eat before crossing Charlotte city limits.
