My wife and I were in the mood for some country music tonight, so Roosters was our pick. First timers for us. We were definitely the youngest people in the bar. When I read it was biker friendly my first thought was \"my people\"........BUT it was like a retirement home in there. Not our age group by 30 years. BUT.......service was good, band was great, and drinks were reasonable.
