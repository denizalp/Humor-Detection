Would it be rude or pretentious of me to admit that I wouldn't find great food and cocktails in Scottsdale? Well, mea culpa. I honestly didn't expect much out of this city when it comes to comestibles. But Citizen Public House surprised me on all levels. \n\nThe cocktails here are crazy good. They even have a little 'speakeasy'-ish mixology lab upstairs that's all secret and only accessible by... wait... can I tell? Anyway, these folks are making some interesting drinks with house-made infusions, tinctures, and various chemistry equipment. Better than the best drinks in PDX? I don't know about that, but impressive all the same. \n\nThe food is a very big surprise for me. The chop chop salad is, from what I understand, legendary, and from tasting it I am not surprised. I also sampled some tasty meatloaf and delicious scallops. The fact that I can't recall the dessert doesn't mean it wasn't memorable, I think it had to do with my focus on the drinks and mains. I recall everyone at the table enjoying them. \n\nService? Impeccable. 'Nuff said. \n\nConsider me a little humbled.
