I love 5 Guys fries.  I find the hamburgers average and usually get a cheese sandwich, which can be dressed like their hamburgers with grilled mushrooms and onions - YUM!  Like other 5 Guys, this location has the fancy soft drink dispensers so you can customize your drink as much as you'd like.  Two concerns are relatively small parking in the front (more parking in the outlet lot behind) and hot in the afternoon with the sun streaming in through the windows.
