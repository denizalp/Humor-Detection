The only thing this place has going for it is the interior, which is a very well designed and clean modern space. Sadly, I'm reviewing a restaurant and not a museum or gallery, so that's where my positivity ends. \n\nPerhaps it was a bit hyped and that is the reason for my intense letdown, but this is honestly one of the worst dining experiences I've had. The menu was very sparse, but I'll accept that if what they specialize in - pizza- is very good. I'm vegetarian, and pizza is a very vegetarian friendly food, but there weren't many options on the menu. Mushrooms are one of my favorite items, so I opted for the rather expensive mushroom pizza. What came out was basically a piece of dry cardboard covered in bad cheese with 3 mushrooms that were disgusting. \n\nBeyond the letdown of the pizza itself, I thought I'd get their olive plate to try to get something in my stomach, and it was yet another letdown. I've never gone back, and don't plan to. In my opinion this place is just pure hipster hype, and nothing more.
