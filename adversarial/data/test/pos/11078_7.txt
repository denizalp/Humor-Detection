Living in the north part of Las Vegas has meant that we need to drive some distances to our favorite eateries, but 2017 is starting off right with the opening of SkinnyFATS' third location.  Located off of the 215 and Decatur near BestBuy, this is excellent news for us because we don't live too far away at all.  We've been fans since the first SF opened on Dean Martin and now we can become regulars here.  \n\nWhat's so great about SkinnyFATS?  The menu offers up the healthy side and the happy side, so depending on what your diet and stomach wants on any given day, you can find an item to satisfy you.  There are also vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options if you need those.  Plus, the staff is friendly and answer any questions you may have about the menu.\n\nLocated in an already busy shopping plaza (the Costco side), just head for Massage Envy and BestBuy and you'll find it.  I'm giving you directions this way so you don't drive around in circles.  The interior of the restaurant has the cool murals like the other locations, a communal table, booths, and tables, plus several flat-screens.  The menu here boasts items that the other locations don't have, too.\n\nWe had dinner here last night and the joint was jumping.  There was a line to the door for ordering, but I didn't really mind since they did just open and it gave us a chance to peruse the menu.  I went with the Healthy Side's T.A.T.S.:  turkey bacon, avocado, tomato, and spinach on 9 grain toast, skipping the spicy yo sauce because I'm a wimp.  This comes with a side and I decided to get happy with truffle fries:  balance!  It was a great little meal and I'd have this healthier version of a BLT again.\n\nI tried the b\/f's Spicy Latina soup side and it was spicy, but very tasty, so try this chicken soup with tortilla strips and pepper jack cheese if you're in the mood.\nFor a first visit at a location that just opened its doors, we left with our Happy Meter reading at \"overjoyed.\"  See you soon, SkinnyFATS.
