I always make reservation here every time I am here in Vegas. I love the atmosphere and the food is absolutely amazing! My favorite so far I would have to say the filet mignon peppered steak with white rice on the side. The cocktails are strong and delicious. And on top of that if everyone in your party order an entr√©e it's free admission to the night club. It's definitely worth every penny.
