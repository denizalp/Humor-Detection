Bad experience. After purchasing a LivingSocial deal for a dermaplane, Faith suggested a chemical peel and microderm instead. Fine. \n\n1. Burning solution in my eye. Had to neutralize with drops. Eye was red all day. \n2.  As my eye was on fire, she kept trying to sell me on eyelash extensions. Bad timing.\n3.  The end result, 2 raw patches on my face and a red eye. \n4.  Oh wait, not the end...awful reaction. Two raw patches and break out.\n5.  Contacted Faith, she said she would fix it when I healed and do a dermaplane for no charge.  3 weeks later I contacted her again, she told me I should see a dermatologist instead.  No apology. \n6.  Fast forward 2 months. My skin is almost back to normal...minus a couple of scars. \n\nThere are so many better places in Scottsdale. Try somewhere else.
