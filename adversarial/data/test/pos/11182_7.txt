I think that Canteen is fantastic in the way of food and drinks.  Everyone who's had one of their margaritas knows that they're fucking incredible.  How could they not be with approximately 6 billion different kinds of tequila behind the bar?\n\nI've been here a couple times and over the weekend was the first time I actually got me some food.  For 8 bucks I got three pretty dinky, little tacos.  They tasted REALLY good, I was all about them, but I'm an eater so it didn't really do much to plug my gut.  For like $9.50, my girlfriend got a torta, which was a pretty damn reasonable size and a side of spicy french fries.  I was like, damn, I should ponied up the extra couple bucks and had gotten that.  I took a bite and it was tasty as fuck.\n\nTheir food is altogether very, very good and very tasty.  Overall, I like the kind of modern theme and decorative motif this place has, but goddamn if the music is just too loud.  I feel like I'm at a high school dance and I'm miserable.  While I was leaving over the weekend, I heard a girl who was eating outside go, \"Oh my god, is the music getting LOUDER?  Why?!\"  I hate those tiny, little tables.  They're like small strips of wood and eating and drinking is a delicate balancing act.  I'm a clumsy asshole, and I'm totally proud of myself for having not broken anything there yet.  I've seen these tables house like a party of four people and I'm kind of impressed that they're able to do it because I need my space, man.
