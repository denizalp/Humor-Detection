Always clean, even the bathrooms.  Large variety of restaurants, besides the typical food court.  All of the usual stores, Victoria's Secret, Bebe, Guess, plus unique new shops that no other mall around has so it's great for tourist & locals.  \n\nToday 2.27.17 Monday, 10:20am was a great time to come cause it was not so busy yet.  The only annoying thing about when it's not so busy, is that there are so many booths in the middle & the salespeople turn on this high-pressured sales w\/ samples to come check out what they have.  It's like in between the Paris & Bally's corridor w\/ high pressure.. if you've been through there, you know what I'm talking about lol.
