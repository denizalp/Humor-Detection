I love this place. Everything I have ever ordered has been good, especially the hummus.  It's a pretty small place, but in the summer you can eat outside on their patio. The staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the menu.\n\nThere are text deals that you can get from 'college mobile deals' (just google it, find Kent State in the search tab, find the deal you want, and enter your cell number free of charge). I just used the text deal with a friend that was for 2 Gyros, 2 orders of fries, and 2 drinks for only $10...it's like a sore dick...ya can't beat it!
