I hate this airport.  And I love this airport.\n\nThe airport is a pain in the behind if you are running on a tight schedule and have a car to drop off.  LAS security lines can be horrendously long so plan ahead.  It's crowded, full of amateur travelers and has cramped gates.\n\nBut, it's also a cool place to hang out if you are early and have time to kill.  Shopping and dining options abound, especially before security.  And of course, the gaming machines!!!!  As a recent convert to video poker, I delight in the ability to lose another $100 just before I board my flight.  Vegas, you have perfected the art of yanking every loose dollar from our pockets and I salute you!\n\nThe bars at McCarran ID everybody.  Period.  No exceptions.  A few months ago, they asked for ID from someone in a wheelchair, with a ventilator and a colostomy bag who turned out to be 100 years old (which wasn't bad because the bartender bought free drinks for all to celebrate the century!!!)\n\nBut really, you had to ID that dude before giving him his Jack and coke?  What. EVAR.\n\nOne of the less mentioned facts about McCarran is its absolutely incredible ability to handle logistics - baggage claim and taxi lines - during the giant conventions that plague Las Vegas.  I have never seen such efficiency elsewhere - this would do Toyota proud in terms of cycle time measurements!!!  Amazing!\n\nLounges are \"meh\" but there are plenty of ways to keep yourself entertained.  LAS is the best place in the world for people watching because you will see every weird nuance of humanity represented her.  Promise you that!  \n\nAnyway, back to video poker before I close... last time, I won $40.  Next time, I clean house.  I will get you McCarran airport... just you wait!!!!\n\n~ 3 stars overall for giving me yet another love-hate relationship in my life.  I need these like I need to step on a cactus with bare feet but hey, they're free :\\  But go to Vegas people, McCarran is just a way-point on your journey to insane wealth in the Sin City :D\n\n# 224
