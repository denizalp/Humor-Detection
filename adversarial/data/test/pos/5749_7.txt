I really love this place! I come here for their hand shaved noodles and usually order beef in xoxo spicy sauce and it's always delicious!  I've also had their soups before and love them too. My husband and I recently tried the dumplings-we got an assortment of steamed and pan-fried-and they were huge and really tasty. My husband usually gets cold dishes and recently had the beef noodles with a lemon and garlic sauce. He chose the thick noodles and they were incredibly long but he figured out a way to eat them easily and he ate everything! \n\nThey serve generous portions and I love that their servers are the perfect level of attentive (they come as soon as you sit and seem to know exactly when I'm ready to order). I also love that you can watch them make the noodles :). Definitely worth trying if you like noodles.
