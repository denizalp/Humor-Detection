I always see this casino whenever I walk outside (those flashy lights). They sent us a coupon to try some cafe place and we ended up checking out the Cannery.\n\nI dig the style of the building, everything seemed so spacious and it looked like everyone was having a decent time.  Despite the whole \"elderly\" appeal that other's have mentioned (I will agree), they don't seem miserable unlike other casinos *cough*silverton*cough*.\n\nThat being said, I WILL DOMINATE YOU ELDERLY FOLK IN POKER! I SAW YOUR TABLES. Remember my face and let it burn in your head, I will make sure you pay my bills! NO MEDS FOR YOU!!!\n\nIt's my review, I do what I want.  I like the place\n\n#getoffmylawn\n#imscaredofdubstep
