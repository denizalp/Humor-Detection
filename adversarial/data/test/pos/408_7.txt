Well I was about to say \"boooooooooooooo banana leaf!\" Because they seated me and then told me they couldn't serve me Bc it was later then they thought. Then they told me It was ok, I could order. And then they told me I had to get it to go. I get it. It's late. They want to close and go home. Their only saving grace are the free spring rolls with That come with a yelp! Check in. Whatever. It's late. Everyone's drunk. I'm drunk. Who cares what the food tastes like. Long live the spring roll.
