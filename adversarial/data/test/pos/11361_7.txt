WOW-This restaurant was an excellent culinary experience in both presentation and food quality although non-vegetarian far exceeded vegetarian options in terms of palatability and detail. The presentation was elegant and creative. The restaurant decor and ambiance was very up-to-date and reflective of a perfect social setting. Service was excellent.
