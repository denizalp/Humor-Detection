Let me first rant for a second.  Boy do I hate the term \"Asian Cuisine.\"  What a generic term for what is really many many many different types of food.  Real Chinese food (hell, even Americanized Chinese food) is very different from real Japanese food is very different from real Thai food is very different from real Korean food is very different from real Vietnamese food. . .you get the picture.   To proclaim that your restaurant serves \"Asian\" food to me says \"we serve generic food\" since it is difficult to master one of these cuisines let alone all of them.   Furthermore, I'm used to Chinese restaurants with some or all of the following in their name - \n\n\"Happy\", \"Joy\", \"Grand\", \"Dragon\", \"Wok\", \"Inn\".  George and Sons sounds more like a deli or a pub or something. \n\n\nAnyway, on a lazy Sunday evening, still a bit burnt from the previous night of partying, my husband and I were looking for some quick, easy, greasy food to fill our bellies that would put us to sleep.   So we picked George and Sons, being that it is so close.  Indeed, the food was all rather generic exactly as I had figured going in.   We ordered take out and the portions were definitely not large enough to warrant the price they charge, and the food can best be described as bland.  The broth in the wonton soup was pretty much straight chicken broth with no flavor and, worse, there was so much spinach in it that the last few sips tasted like the run off when you defrost one of those frozen bricks of spinach from the grocery store.   The spring roll was decent enough but small, and they didn't give us any duck sauce for dipping (is that standard here?).  The steamed chicken and veggies didn't have baby corn or water chestnuts which I thought were standards of this dish.   The beef and broccoli and house chow mein again were pretty bland (hell, the term \"chow mein\" itself basically means \"generic noodle dish\").\n\nAs far as Chinese takeout, George and Sons serves overpriced average food.
