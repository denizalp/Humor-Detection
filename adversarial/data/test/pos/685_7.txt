You can learn a culture from their Desserts? Then come to Patchmon's Thai Dessert and More for a taste of \"Real\" Thailand and its People.\n\nThe 2 sweet shop owners just reminds me of the kindness and hospitality of Thai. A big smile, A warm welcome and one got to try every single dessert available that day!! \n\nJust like other Asian desserts, nothing here is overly sweet. Some even has a balance of sweet and savory. \n\nCome here on Saturdays if you want to try some authentic dessert that needs special preparation. And of course you can always pre order some for pick up!\n\nFor most up to date selections, check out their Facebook page.\n\nPatchmon's though a little far for me, but if I willing to travel to Thailand to eat, I should be able to come to Patchmon's for some of their sweets!
