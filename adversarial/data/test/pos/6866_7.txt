Love this palace.  If you're a big fan of the Tiny Homes movement like me, this place is a must visit.  I can't wait to purchase my first Tiny home.\n\nThe recycled containers are fantastic.  Love the vertical tower design. They have a nice courtyard where kids can play, and a stage for performances designed for locals and visitors. \n\nThere are plenty of shopping here, local businesses. Please support them. There is a very tiny coffee shop. You order on the side, outside like a drive thru.  Don't forget to checkout the dinosaur up front, and bring a key lock to share.\n\nCheers!
