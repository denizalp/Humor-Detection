Hash House is perfect fit for Vegas - oversized, excessive, indulgence but really the experience is just mediocre. \n\nOther than the size of the portions, I found nothing enjoyable.  I tried their signature sage fried chicken and waffles.  What a mess. The fried chicken was more breading than chicken and was rather flavorless and dry. And the waffle tasted stale.  The gratuitous piece of bacon inserted into the middle of the waffle added nothing to the dish. \n\nThe restaurant is in a windowless room on the second floor of the old Imperial Palace. It was dark, dingy and slightly claustrophobic.   \n\nThis is one and done for me.
