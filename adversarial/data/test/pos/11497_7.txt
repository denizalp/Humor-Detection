Since this is my first review, I'm feeling the pressure to make it as thorough and honest as possible. So here goes... \n\nWhen planning my wedding, I was looking for a caterer who shared my food values. I wanted someone who would present my guests with some delicious local food; someone who would be low-key and easy to work with.  UFC seemed to be just what I was looking for. But then, I should have known it wouldn't be so easy.  \n\nFirst, I had to email approximately 15 times before I was able to set up a meeting with them. Since I live in San Francisco, I had a window of about a week  to meet with them. Needless to say, they weren't very interested in accommodating me. \n\nThen, the meeting. After the general unhelpfulness of our scheduling exchanges, my expectations were low, but wow! Now, I generally expect that when I meet with a caterer, I'll get to taste some of their food. Not so. I (sort of) understood, since they don't have a kitchen facility, per se.  I reminded myself to keep an open mind.  \n\nMost caterers will lead you through the initial meeting, getting a sense of what you're looking for, your budget, your style. Not this guy. What we got was... well, not much besides a lot of chef peacockery.  Now, being from San Francisco, I'm used to food snobs. I am fluent in their language - they are my people.  But UFC made me feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman - the scene when she is hysterically pulling wads of cash out of her purse, begging to be waited on in Beverly Hills. \n\nSurprise, surprise, they never called me back - another giant red flag - and I didn't pursue them either. I did send an email letting them know how disappointed I was, which (of course) was never replied to.  I would caution anyone against working with these folks.  Even though their mission and food seem to be top notch, their diva behavior is just too much. I only wish I could give zero stars.
