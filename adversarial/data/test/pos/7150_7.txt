I stopped by about two or three months ago and I've been meaning to come back to try something else. But, every time I go out for lunch I always end up going somewhere else. What does that tell you? Well, it tells me there are many more enticing options. This place was ok, just not good enough to make me come back.\n\nThe place is nice, comfortable, and spacious with modern furniture and a mix of seating options -- couches, tables, pub-height tables. It seems like it would be a cool place to hang out, but I unfortunately don't have enough free time to just hang out at a coffee shop\/sandwich shop.\n\nSo the sammie I got was called the Mandalay Bay ($7). It's their version of Capriotti's Bobbie... Thanksgiving on a bun. Well, their version wasn't as good as the Bobbie. It was smaller and they used sliced turkey instead of pulled roasted turkey. The stuffing and cranberry sauce were good, though. The bread was decent, but a little on the crunchy side. As a side I got some excellent pasta salad, which had bits of sausage, salami, and tomatoes in it.\n\nThe staff was all nice and friendly. The atmosphere was comfortable. But, ultimately, their food didn't impress me enough to get me to come back.\n\n2.5 stars
