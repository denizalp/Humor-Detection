They scammed me on my price cause I was stupid and didn't read the contract. I was supposed to pay 14,000 and change total with a down payment of $2000 on my CC. The next day I read the contract better and realized they charged me 14,000.00 after the down payment on my CC. I went back and they said I could not return it! I know it was my fault for not reading the contract but thats what you get for trusting SCAMMERS!!! NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE!!!
