First let's start with the good - great location right in the heart of downtown. Cool vibe being all in glass and for people watching. Place was buzzing and it had a fun \"after work\" kind of feel. On the good front the oysters were great, the salmon tartar, the poached egg with wild mushrooms and the French fries were all incredible. So was the mixed drink which had such a complex taste profile. On the negative side, tables are close together and the lighting was a little bright for my taste. Food - I'm sorry to say we thought the burger was terrible. Very dry and overcooked when we ordered medium rare. Not one bit of pink. Also the side of vegetables in contrast were so undercooked they were basically raw (and they were root veggies so that's not a stylistic thing) and I noticed the person next to me sent hers back. All in all this was okay for me. I wouldn't go back but it really wasn't my type of restaurant so it may be a matter of taste.
