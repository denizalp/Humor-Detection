Good news for all you bulimics!\nThis food is so rich, it'll come right back up just as quick as it went down - and with no finger-coaxing!\n\nI told my wife I was sick, but she never listens (kinda like me). \nAnyway, we rounded out restaurant week here with a 12 oz. ribeye, some creamed spinach, and tempura battered onion rings.\nAll of it was damned tasty, even on a sick stomach.\n\nSadly, for anyone leaving after us, they would have had to negotiate my dinner on the sidewalk in front of the elevator. \nAlso, my wife, whose shoes got caught by some wayward spinach splash, was pretty bummed, although I'm not sure why.\nI can't figure out if it was her ruined shoes, or if she was upset we just spent 170 bucks and half of it wound up on a sidewalk.\n\nAnyways, my sincere apologies to management, and, the poor shite who had to clean up the mess.
