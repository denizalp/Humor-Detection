I'm holding back a full review just yet.  I popped in here based on outside looks of the place.  It looked intriguing and sucked me in.  \n\nOnce in, I found there to be some major dissapointments.  First, the beer, no draft beer specifically.  Big thumbs down for that.  Secondly, the menu.  All spanish titles and english descriptions below the title.  My ADD will not allow this.  I'm sorry.  And third, the lack of salads on the menu.  All the plates and entrees seemed very large and I think it would do some good to lighten it up a bit.
