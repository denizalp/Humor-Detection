I'm going to really like the Hampton brand. This place has yummy soft beds, soft pillows and is so quiet and sleep so well. Everything works great, the room has beautiful desk to work at with lots of work surface, and I really like that. This particular Hampton was a little hard to find this it's set way off from the road with an undeveloped lot between the hotel and the road for the address. So it's invisible as you're driving down the street looking for the sign you have to look far across the slot and then you'll see it. It was tough the first time but after that ain't no problem. The breakfast is the usual and I do love my hot oatmeal. Lots of fruit and I like that too. It's a nice part of town that's way away from the big strip and that minimizes traffic and makes life really easy. It was a few more miles for me to drive to the racetrack but I sure think it's worth it. The place is clean with the funniest looking rug in the Halls, but that's just for my amusement. Would I stay here again? You bet. The price performance is excellent
