Absolutely scrumpalipadopicalistrociously delicious.\n\nI can't contain my excitement as this place is a 30 second walk from the office. As the rise of the poke bowls and sushi wraps peak in popularity, there are tons of places to choose from for food. Squarefish has a modern designed logo and delicious bowls to offer!\n\nComing here on a weekday for lunch, Square Fish offers a half portion for the bowls (half of the container that it is served in), but this amount is actually WAY more than enough. These half bowls come to a before tax price of $10 ($6.50 to $9) range depending if you only want veggies or you want meat in it as well. If you want the full portions, it ranges from ($10 to $14). \n\nIn the spicy salmon bowl, there was kale. LOTS or kale, which I actually don't like too much of. The bottom portion was filled with rice padded down, and it had bits of everything from taro chips, to seaweed salad, and of course the spicy salmon! \n\nI'm not sure if the sushi itself is worth it after seeing the price and the size of the sushi, but the bowls are definitely worth it!
