Short Ribs Grilled Cheese Sandwich!!!\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words.  It's the pictures, not the reviews, of Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich that got me to bookmark this place. I didn't know much of Fat Choy or even the Eureka Casino until Terri R. mentioned it during lunch a couple of weeks ago.  I read a couple of reviews and thought maybe.  But after looking at a few pictures, I knew I had to eventually pay a visit for their Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. \n\nYesterday was perfect.  I was in a meeting in California and just experienced a really bad lunch.  In the middle of my presentation, I get the text from Terri R. to meet at Fat Choy for dinner when I get back in town. If you read Terri R's review, she mentioned she dragged me here.  Not even close.  No one has to drag me to anything that equals me eating. Remember, my favorite food is seconds. \n\nThe service was really good, but also expected since we were 2 out of only 4 customers in this joint.  Of course I had the short ribs grilled cheese w\/fries and Terri had the same.  The sandwich is as good as advertised.  Imagine a perfectly made grilled cheese sandwich and a couple of pieces of tender fall off the bone short ribs.  Then put those together with sauce that isn't overpowering and not too much of it.  That's what you get with Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  It's worth another visit and if I was still a drinker, this would make the perfect hangover meal.
