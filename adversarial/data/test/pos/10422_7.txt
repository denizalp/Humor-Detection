Time for another update.  I went to the movies at the Manor with three of my girlfriends last night.  Two of them have kids and had to go home afterwards, but Sherry and I were still up for something else.  And with all the great coffeehouses right by the Manor, naturally we trekked down to the Beehive!  It's still a cool place as ever and we got an intense game of Candyland up!
