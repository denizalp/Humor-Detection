Bacchanal Buffet, you are one of the best reasons to visit Las Vegas. With my party of four, we waited about 30 minutes on a late Sunday afternoon (around 2PM). What I like about the waiting time is that they allow you to leave temporarily to wander around Las Vegas as you wait for your table to be ready. It's pretty convenient that Bacchanal Buffet gives you an estimated time to return to the line and also sends you a text message to alert you to head back to the buffet.\n\nAs for the food, the variety is pretty much endless. You have your seafood (crab legs, scallop, seabass, etc.), your different ethnic entrees (Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, etc.), and your desserts (caramel flan, gelato, creme brulee, tiramisu, etc.). The quality and presentation of all the food is unbelievably beyond satisfactory and is definitely a meal worth splurging on when you visit Las Vegas. Also, the workers are all very friendly as well and always stop by your table to clean up your old plates and refill your desired drinks.\n\nEvery time that I visit Las Vegas, I always make sure to leave a meal time open for Bacchanal Buffet. I highly suggest that you do the same as well :)
