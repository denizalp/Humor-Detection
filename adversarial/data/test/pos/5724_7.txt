Grease is the word\n\nAt the time, it seemed like a good idea to give Mojo's a try.  Their Facebook page proudly proclaims: Voted BEST FISH FRY in Waunakee!  But after my dismal experience at Mojo's, I just recoil in horror to think how craptacular the second place finisher in the fish fry category must have been.\n\nAnyway, on to my tale of woe...\n\nThe warning signs were there early.  To enter Mojo's from the parking lot, you need to run a gauntlet of smokers congregated by the entry way.  Nothing like filling your lungs with second hand smoke to whet your appetite.   Added bonus: the ketchup-encrusted outdoor tabletop that I passed on the way in.\n\nI grabbed a table by the front window and warmly greeted by one of the bartenders.  I asked about the fish fry since it wasn't on the menu.  There were a variety of options (baked or deep fried cod, walleye and bluegill).  I selected the deep fried cod and proceeded to the soup and salad bar.\n\nWords cannot describe the foul nastiness of the three soup options.  While I could identify the chili by sight, only a forensic pathologist could have determined the other two options were clam chowder and cheeseburger.  I could not bring myself to sample the latter two; you'll just have to rely on the pictures I posted.  The chili was your typical one star fare.  It was covered by a thick layer of grease, much like the other two soup options.  The texture of the hamburger was grainy from its extended stay in the warming bucket.  The beans were overcooked and in attempt to cover up the multitude of sins with the dish, the chef must have added a pile of chili powder. \n\nThe salad bar was just as lame: wilted greens, limp vegetables, stale croutons and an orange, shredded, cheese-like substance.\n\nThankfully, my meal was delivered before I could finish my salad.  The plate passed the eye test - it actually looked pretty good.  I should have stopped there.\n\nHash browns:  The secret to cooking good hash browns is to remove as much liquid as possible from the potatoes before cooking them.  Otherwise, you get a soggy mess.  Much the like hash browns served by Mojo's.  Now try to fry the soggy potatoes in too much oil and salt.  Now you get salty, soggy, greasy hash browns, much like the ones served at Mojo's.  But let's not stop there; let's melt a glob of that orange cheese-like substance over the top.  Now you have achieved supreme hash brown suckitude.  Congratulations, Mojo's, you've made me want to swear off hash browns for the rest of my life.  \n\nCole slaw:  Soggy and bland, but relatively inoffensive.  \n\nRoll:  It had the consistency of a stress ball.  The stress ball probably would have tasted better.  Not fresh and definitely not homemade.\n\nFish:  The first piece of cod was pretty good. It was crunchy on the outside and moist and flaky on the inside.  The coating was bland, but better than fish sticks from Mrs. Paul's.  The second piece, which was larger, was much greasier and cool on the inside.  The second piece also absorbed the off taste of the oil in the deep fryer that haunted me for a couple of days.\n\nAs for the setting, it is your typical small town bar and grill with ESPN and Fox News playing on the various flat screen TVs.  The bar area was packed with patrons in the middle of a Friday afternoon.  (Diners were sparser).  There was music playing in the background (top 40 I think), but not too loud to impede a casual conversation.  To their credit, all the indoor tabletops were clean.  Toward the end of my meal, I was plagued by a swarm of flies, probably waiting for me to drop after foolishly consuming the Mojo's chili.\n\nService was mixed. I was immediately greeted and my server kept my soda glass full and checked in after the food was served.  On the other hand, the server did not mention the daily specials until I asked and she failed to tell me there was an upcharge for the cheese and onions on the hash browns.\n\nThe damages for the meal came to $12.56, an unsettled stomach that lasted a couple of days and a solemn vow never again to trust the voters in the Best of Waunakee polling.  \n\nAnd this closes yet another sordid chapter of the Waunakee Yelp Chronicles.
