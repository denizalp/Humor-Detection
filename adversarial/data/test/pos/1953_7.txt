This place is a huge dump and I like it.  It's cleaner than it looks, but there is always someone smoking in the doorway.\n\nThe good:\n- $1.50 drafts of 50 - it's a mystery small serving size... I *think* it's less than a half pint but... more than a third of a pint? It's a weird size... and it's definitely not in poor taste to be double fisting. \n\n...I think that's my entire review.
