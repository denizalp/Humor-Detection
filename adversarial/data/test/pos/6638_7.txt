\"Cotton candy, laced in gold.  Stack that money, sushi roll.  Bottles up, feeling throw'd .  V.I.P it, overload.\" ― Iggy Azalea, My World\n\nAfter a long weekend of being off-the-grid where we had 5-min lukewarm showers daily, wind-burn action left and right, and being covered in trout slime for like three days, we wandered back into town and headed to Osaka Japanese Steakhouse for Happy Hour.  I'm surprised they let me in because I was looking pretty gross.\n\nI think we pretty much ordered one of everything off the Happy Hour menu.  We had an assortment of salads and sushi rolls and everything was delicious.  I appreciated how the rolls weren't heavy on rice and very generous with the fish and other fillings.  Two out of six of us doesn't care for raw fish and they were even satisfied by the selection.  The Picasso and The Vegas Rolls were especially delicious and I want to be back again [to the closer Gilbert location] for these beauties!  I also want to go back for a cocktail!  Gimme that Mango Mai Tai!\n\nThis place is truly gorgeous.  The staff here is friendly and service is very prompt.  Never was a glass left half-empty at our table.  I want more fish!  4.5 stars!
