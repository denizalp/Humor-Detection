I mean I didn't really expect much from this kind of dining establishment ... So it was decent for \"bar\/ fast casual\" kind of food. \n\nI got the Cobb Salad with double chicken and avocado, sans bacon, cheese and dressing. Not the worst but also, I wasn't full for all that long. \n\nEveryone else seemed to enjoy their food, and I was impressed they serve up Durham Ranch Grass-Fed Bison meat! \n\nIt's an easy option that can please multiple palettes, I just probably would have preferred Chipotle!
