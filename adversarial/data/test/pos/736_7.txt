I'm a busy mama but I like to look good with minimal effort due to time crunching.\n\nI've wanted to try these individual lashes for the past year. In comes Cherry Las referred by a fellow yelper.\n\n\n\nThe Cherry Lash Lounge was clean,  a plus, and well organized.\n\nI was taken to a large recliner and laid back for the hour plus lash gluing. It was fantastic.  My lashes were like Bambi. \nI was comfortable the entire time even though I was apprehensive at first.\n\nMy lashes lasted almost a month with care.\nWill I do it again?  Heck yeah!
