Welcome to Las Vegas for me. As of Labor Day weekend 2015, my parents and I were staying here for two nights at Paris Casino and Hotel. As we entered, the atmosphere is remarkably mesmerizing! The interior and the concept inside the lobby is very Paris, France feel filled with parts of the Eiffel Tower, daylight painting backgrounds, live music, strippers at the middle side of the bar, and many more! Of course, this place is the home of this Broadway's classic hit, the \"Jersey Boys.\"\n\nEvery slot machines work very well, so you can play it all day long if you're in luck to win. There's also more gambling games like blackjack, Pai Gow, roulette, Keno, and much more!\n\nThe wi-fi, it's a mixed bag. The smartphone connectivity works well to use, but for laptop users, it's a hassle. As I logged on through my laptop, there's a choice to use hourly limit useage costing around $13.99 to pay. Otherwise, if you have the access code to connect their wi-fi, you can access it for free. Update; so far as of 9\/7\/2015, it did managed it successfully, so I have no issues for the connectivity problems.\n\nThe hotel staying. Few months ago, we did paid a hotel room reservations with Paris for 3 days (2 nights) this Labor Day weekend costing around $160 before we booked and heading it as of today. The view of their hotel room that we reserved looked very good. We can see some of the Las Vegas strip easier to view. The bathroom functions work alright as I took a bath. Not a bad stay!\n\nIn the end, Paris Casino and Hotel is the finest and the coolest casino & hotel in Las Vegas. A well worth the stay to retrieve fantastic Sin City's experiences. My rating: 3 1\/2 stars.
