While walking around the city recently after a movie, my girl and I thought we'd go with a safe bet: Boston Pizza. I've been to BP many times in the past, and have no gripes with their food. I had never been to this location though.\n\nI have to say, the setup in this one is definitely classier than the ones I've been to in the past, and is very nice. Anyway, we took a seat upstairs, with a glorious view of uh...road construction?\n\nOur waitress was definitely a nice girl, but she really gave off an overwhelmed vibe, which was funny, because it really didn't seem that busy at all. Anyway, we ordered drinks, and she was pretty prompt with bringing them to us. For food, my girl ordered a DELICIOUS chicken sandwich with honey mustard, and I (in a completely unexpected turn of events) ordered a prime rib burger. The food arrived in a timely fashion, and while my burger was fairly average, everything was still decent.\n\nSo where does the 2-star rating fit in? Well, we witnessed one thing that kind of bugged me. While in conversation, we both jumped about 3 feet in the air, when we heard a loud bang next to us. We quickly learn it was due to a waiter throwing a bunch of hard-cover menus down on the table next to us while seating some customers who just arrived. The reason for his sudden menu-drop? It seemed that he was seating the new arrivals at a table that had not yet been cleaned, and he stormed off to get the spray stuff and whatnot. Whether or not it was a tantrum-esque menu toss, or if it was accidental, I'm not sure. It certainly appeared to be deliberate, as he looked pissed off, and I think that's pretty unprofessional. I wonder how the new arrivals felt about that.\n\nNot too long after that, we ordered another round of drinks, and our waitress vanishes. A long time goes by, and she comes by asking if we need anything. We ask about the drinks, and she confesses that she forgot all about our drink order. Okee dokee. She vanishes yet again, and we're at a point where we don't even really want the drinks anymore, until finally she brings them by. Waiting for the bill was another fun time. To be fair, she did apologize at the end for being scatter-brained that night, which we appreciated, but we've both experienced so much better from BP in the past. I'd return, but I'd be pretty hesitant.
