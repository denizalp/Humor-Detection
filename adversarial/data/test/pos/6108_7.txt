Five stars for a kick-ass workout but note to anyone reading... this is the HOTTEST studio in town.  Be prepared to drip sweat if you head to Radi8 for a hot class.  That being said, if you like to sweat, this studio is for you!\n\nI've taken more than a handful of classes here, both the hot classes and the flow classes.  While the radi8HOT class is a set sequence, the same each time you visit, it can feel different based on your body, your mindset, your position in the room, the instructor, the music, and so much more.  The flow classes are a nice change to that set sequence and not as crazy hot.\n\nThe Radi8 staff have always been friendly.  The facility is clean, and the ice cold towels are a nice touch.  The studio has a decent sized retail area for all of your yoga apparel and accessory needs and there is a fridge where I've often overpaid for H2O and coconut water too!\n\nThe hot classes are 65 minutes while the flow classes are 50-60 minutes in length... depending on if it's an express class or not.  The shorter classes are a great way to get a workout in without the time commitment needed to take a complete class at some of the other local studios.  I also find it refreshing that if you come late or leave early, there is no \"judging.\"  \n\nI'm grateful for all of the fabulous studios that yogis get to choose from in the area... and Radi8 is no exception.  Namaste.
