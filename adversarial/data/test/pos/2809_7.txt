I love The Big Bang and I'm not embarrassed to admit it. There's something about coming here on a Friday night after a long day at work, getting drunk, singing loudly, and imagining that I'm a rock star (and not tone deaf) that just puts me in a good mood. \n\nYeah, there's a cover and the drinks aren't cheap but it's still a good time. I try not to pee when I come here because the lines are always long and once I break the seal I am a goner.
