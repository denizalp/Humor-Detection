If renowned Old Town Scottsdale restaurant Cafe Monarch had a little breakfast and lunch sibling, Arcadia Farms would fit the mold.  Or at least the Cafe portion of this operation would.  That said, Arcadia Farms is more of a complex than anything else.  First an foremost, Arcadia Farms is a restaurant and cafe.  Next door, the Marketplace sells assorted baked goods, cookbooks, and knick knacks.  And surrounding the cafe and marketplace are various private dining rooms that are used frequently for big groups (my sister actually used one of them for a baby shower not too long ago).  As for me, I just wanted a good breakfast on a Sunday morning and I'd never tried Arcadia Farms.  At the opening bell, I was their first Sunday customer that morning.\n\nI should cop to the fact that as soon as I arrived, I immediately felt underdressed.  Based on the Google street images of the Cafe front patio I fully expected my usual shorts, t-shirt, and sandals combo to be adequate attire.  While the Cafe staff didn't implicitly or explicitly judge me on it, the customers that poured in later that morning were all in their Sunday best.  Thus my unshaven, baseball cap wearing self stuck out like a sore thumb.  Nevertheless, I grabbed a seat near the front and pressed on.  The Cafe has a small amount of seating inside, but the emphasis here is definitely the patios that line the front, side, and back of the restaurant.  I'd guess at least 2\/3rds of the seating here is outside, which is great as long as the weather is cool as it was this morning.  And as others have pointed out, the interior restaurant is akin to a sitting in a contemporary living room, which is really where the Cafe Monarch comparison comes in from my experience.  Its more laid back than Cafe Monarch, but it still evokes a cozy, romantic feel similar to Monarch.\n\nI started with a standard glass of OJ before taking a gander at the menu.  I'd peeked into the Marketplace before walking into the Cafe for breakfast so I knew I wanted to grab something from the bakery to start with.  I asked for their Homemade Cinnamon and & Pecan Rugalach out of pure curiosity, but unfortunately the bakery didn't have any available.  So instead the waitress grabbed me a pair of Strawberry N'Cream Scone bites and made them complimentary.  They were still warm and soft upon arriving at my table.  A nice fruity, savory snack to start things off (and that was nice of them to make it free).  Next up, I'd read the hype about their housemade granola parfait so I ordered one of those.  It's served in a tall wine glass and includes assorted berries (mine had raspberries, strawberries, and I think rhubarb?), vanilla yogurt, and granola mixed with dried apricots.  It lived up to the hype.  Smooth, creamy dish with a great mix of tartness contrasted by the mellow crunch of the granola.  Most would be perfectly happy with this as their breakfast for the day.  But I wanted to try one more item.  On their \"Arcadia Classics\" menu section, the Egg Strata Cobbler read like a mashup of things I loved but never thought to put together.  Oven roasted veggies, cheddar cheese, sausage and creme fraiche (insert your own South Park joke here).  I had expected this to come on a plate, but instead its stacked high in a bowl with copious amounts of that creme fraiche.  Its comfort food to be sure, but probably one of the classier comfort food dishes I've had.  And fortunately it was also ridiculously delicious.  They didn't skimp on the cheese and there were plenty of nice chunks of sausage mixed in with the veggies.\n\nTotal cost for the food, OJ, tax and tip came to about $28.  The atmosphere felt alot like Cafe Monarch to me, but fortunately the prices did not.  My waitress was a super sweet lady (didn't catch her name) and the entire meal was phenomenal.  The crowds were definitely swelling as the morning went on, so my advice would be to get here at or near opening as I did.  Parking is also a little bit tricky if you can't grab one of the street spots.  I'd park at Panera Bread a few blocks east of here and walk over if you can't get a street spot.  Founder Carolyn Ellis can beam with pride over Arcadia Farms which she created in 1990 as just a simple take out bakery.  Today its a robust destination for breakfast, lunch, baked goods, and elaborate receptions.  And really any place that evokes memories of Cafe Monarch for me is a winner in my book.
