Oasis is an adult club located in the heart of downtown, at Carlton & Jarvis near College Station. \n\nThe entire club is clothing optional.\n\nThey give you your own locker to store everything and a key wristband. \nThey have fresh towels in the locker rooms and given the nature of the club all locker rooms are co-ed. \n\nOasis is primarily aimed at women and couples and most days are exclusive to them, meaning that no single men can attend those days. These are Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. \n\nSingle men are can go on Mondays (for 35 and under Student Mondays), Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Sunday nights. \n\nI go for the nice heated pool that's open all year round and for the hot tubs.  I've been for the \"Student Mondays\" where its $20 for Single Men under 35 with a Student ID and for the \"Hot Springs\" Wednesdays where it's $40 for single men again with student ID. \n\nYour cover charge gives you unlimited in-out privileges all day, from 11AM, which is nice. You can leave the club grab some food and then come back for a swim. \n\nOasis has a decent selection of beers on tap, including Mill St. Organic & Tankhouse Ale, & Steamwhistle. The prices are a bit high considering how expensive the cover is. Cover for single men without student ID is usually $50.\n\nThe cover charge is pretty steep which is why I mostly go on Mondays. It would be nice if they offered an annual membership. But $20 for all day access to a nice heated pool and laid-back, open minded atmosphere is a decent deal.\n\nIf you're a student (19+) I'd give Oasis a chance. There's nothing else like it in Toronto.
