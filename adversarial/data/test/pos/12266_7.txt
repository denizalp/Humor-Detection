We recently used this company to have some minor dents, dings, and chips repaired on both my car and my husbands car.  \n\nA representative came to our house at the time he promised and gave us a quote for repairs.\n\nOn the day of the repairs, the crew showed up on time. They were professional and got the job done in the time promised. They did an outstanding job at getting two very ugly dents out of my front and rear bumper. They repaired all chips and honestly, my car looks brand new again! I am so pleased with their work.  \n\nPrices aren't necessarily cheap, but they are reasonable considering the amount of time and care they put in to get the job done. The BMW dealership would have charged me triple the cost for these repairs.
