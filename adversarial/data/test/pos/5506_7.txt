After leaving I remembered why we usually only come here for drinks. Food was decent - the quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Service was meh - lots of extra cups and dishes at our table throughout the meal. What saves the Harp is their view, I'll just continues to keep my visits to see it sporadic.
