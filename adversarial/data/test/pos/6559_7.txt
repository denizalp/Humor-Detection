Damn... Helen Y beat me to the punch and got the FTR for this place!  Oh well, I will say that she did a great job with her review - I think I was Thai in a past life; I swear, I could eat Thai food every night and be happy.  I was having a usual Thai food craving, so I popped into Thai House this evening and ordered the spicy eggplant dish (add extra veggies and tofu) - medium spice + brown rice to go.  (Yes, they have brown rice!)  I was totally blown away by how great  my dinner was!\n\nThe sauce was just spicy enough, the tofu firm, and the veggies flavorful.  I was impressed that the order was filled with big chunks of luscious eggplant (I really love eggplant), but since I had them add extra veggies, it came with spinach, mushrooms, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, onions, and peppers too.  My total was $11.82, and I had the best dinner I've had in a long while.  I probably could've had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow, but it was so good, i ate it all!\n\nI can't wait to go back to Thai House to try some of the other menu items soon!  If you're looking for good Thai food in Scottsdale, give Thai House a shot!
