This is an evening dining experience review.\n\nI went there hungry for a brunch item (french toast covered in cheese and bacon stuck to the toast with cheese as the glue).\n\nOnce they told me that a great dining alternative would be Mac and Cheese - I said sure, sign me up.\n\nWell after only ordering the Mac and cheese and one drink, and $40 later for only me! (read: super expensive resto) I was slightly disappointed.\n\nWhile the Mac and Cheese was good... I'm a man. A man who eats, like a real man. Perhaps this place was just trying to teach me portion control, I thought. Especially since they seem to be telling me what's all right in life.\n\nWaiter: Will anyone be joining you tonight?\nMe: Nope, just me.\nWaiter: weep, that a okay.\n\nPerhaps I'm reading into it too much, he was a fairly nice guy, really.\n\nBack on track with my above thought on eating like a man...\nI'd say, if you are not hungry, then this is a great place to dine.\nBut if you are looking for volume for value, this isn't it.\n\nI'll have to update my review once I actually get to eat the dish i came here for... That French toast.\n\nRecap:\nEnvironment, location, staff, ambiance: top notch\nValue: good. But be prepared to spend $$$ on meals for models.\nPre or post eat.\n\nz
