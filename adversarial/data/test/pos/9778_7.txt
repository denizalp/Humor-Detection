You will always find \"sales\" in factory outlet stores.  I am not impressed.  The only way to impress me is to find my size in a shoe that looks decent and feels comfortable. \n\nSo, we came here while avoiding the Strip, looking for some new shoes for Mr. B.  He wears a size that is difficult to find in any style.  But this time, we got lucky.  He found two pairs of handsome, everyday casual shoes that fit perfectly.  And each was priced between $80-$90, so we dished out the $$.  Perhaps now I can convince him to toss some of those holey, grimy ones he is so attached to.  Goody!
