Was very disappointed with our visit to Miro and it came down to one thing - food quality and prep.  First, I'll say the atmosphere is inviting and the service was exceptional.   \n\nWe had a drink and tapas in the bar and the bar tenders were the most friendly and fun we've met in some time.  I would recommend it as a place for drinks anytime.  \n\nBut - the food was under\/ over cooked and cold in places.   It really was 'blow the kitchen up and start over' bad.   Something must have happened for this place to become popular.  It must have been good at one time but is no more.  All three of the dishes we tried were exceptionally bad. \n\nWe love authentic Spanish dishes and were really hoping we had found a great spot - but Outside of stopping for drinks, I'd pass it on by.
