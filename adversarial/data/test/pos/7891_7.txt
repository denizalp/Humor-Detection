I had several trusted family members and a few yelpers with similar tastes as myself tell me that I needed to make a stop at Emeril's.  They all told me the same thing, service was top notch, the food was amazing and every single one of them gave me rave reviews and stories about their evening.  So I marked it as a place we had to stop off at.\n\nLet me just say that I do not hate Emeril the chef.  And while I can't stand to sit down and watch his cook show, I actually respect him as a cook, more importantly as a philanthropist, with the foundations he has set up and all the work he has done to repairing New Orleans.  That said I think I could have just given one of those foundations 200 bucks cash, and I think I would have been left feeling more satisfied then I did dinning and paying for the meal that I had here.\n\nSo let's begin with the evening, we started out all well and good, and we wanted to try the chefs tasting menu, my g\/f who is much smaller then me didn't think she could handle eating four courses, so what we wanted to do was I would order the 4 course tasting menu, and she would pick out three dishes of her own, she was going to get a salad, soup and main and we were just going to split the dessert.  The server then told us we couldn't because the kitchen couldn't get the timing on the dishes going out to the table.  I then asked would it make it better if we ordered two desserts, to which he said no.  He then went and told us that if we each are sitting at the same table and wanted to do the chefs tasting menu we each had to order it.  I asked him, if I were to come alone would I be allowed to order the tasting menu, and he told me I could.  I couldn't figure out or understand why it would be different if two people were sitting at the same table.  Anywho we both got the tasting menu in the end.\n\nSalad:  Blue crab meat, red onion, carrot, cucumber & mixed greens tossed in sweet soy vinaigrette, with fried pickled ginger and sesame seeds.\n\nSimple clean flavors, the crab meat was cooked to keep it's natural sweetness and delicate texture which was great, however the vinaigrette was a bit strong for my tastes can seemed to overpower then entire dish.  It was an OK dish, it did seem like it was something I could go to any fusion-asian restaurant though.\n\nSeafood:  Sweet Barbecued Loch Duart Salmon on Andouille, sausage and potato brabants with spicy onion crust and Emeril's housemade Worcestershire.\n\nWith all the work and things that they did for this dish, it was ultimately forgettable at best, what ever was on the crust for flavor was long gone by the time I got to eat it and with all the elements that went into creating this dish I thought it would have had a bigger impact, additionally, with all the ingredients the presentation of the dish was sloppy.\n\nMeat:  Grilled Pork Tenderloin & baja shrimp on white cheddar, cheese and chive mashed potatoes with caramelized onion reduction and flash fried kale.\n\nWhat can I say about this dish?  This is where things went really down hill.  We got our dishes and first thing I notice is that the portion sizes are different, mine is smaller and more rectangular then hers, and even without cutting it open I knew my piece was way, overcooked, her's on the other hand was pretty questionably undercooked.  (Bloody pork.)  I thought the reason we did this all this was so they could get the cooking time right on the tasting menu!  I was dumbfounded and flagged a server, (ours was no where to be seen) she then looked at it and told us it was normal.  I told her it was the pork dish from the tasting menu not a beef dish.  She then took it back and the chef's went and re-fired her meat.\n\nDesert:  Apple Strudel with Caramel Sauce, Caramel ice cream and whipped cream.\n\nI really didn't get this dish, I thought it was supposed to be a warm strudel dish but that could be enjoyed with the ice cream and Caramel sauce, it was cold the entire dish was cold.  The pastry shell on top was soggy and cold throughout, it was actually frozen to the bottom of the plate.  It was inedible.  Two bites and we were done.\n\nSadly the one good thing that stood out from this night is the bread, it was the only thing that I could say was really good and memorable.  The rest of the menu was forgettable, poorly executed, and frankly a disappointment.  We saw our server only a few times that night, when he came to take our order, when he brought two of our four dishes and the check.  That was it, sadly, it was a very slow weekend, the restaurant was very empty and there was an abundance of wait staff, and bus boys, but for some reason they were all to busy to refill drinks.  The couples at the other tables next to us said they noticed the same thing.  \n\nSo sorry guys, Emeril's may have been a great restaurant at one time, but it wasn't when we were there, and with all the choices of restaurants in Vegas these days, there are plenty of other places I would rather spend my money.
