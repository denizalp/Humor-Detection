Wow, just had the most rude experience at Volcano Tea. The lady working the register yelled at everyone to get out in a disrespectful and condescending voice saying, \"Excuse me, it's closing time. You HAVE to go.\"\n\nOther establishments that I have been to before ask patrons to leave in a nice manner explaining that it is closing time. \n\nThis used to be my favorite place to grab boba and hang out but my friends and I will definitely not come back.
