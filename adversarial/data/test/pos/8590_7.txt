Lawd! I've died and gone to vegan heaven. It's a shame that there aren't more vegan friendly places around Charlotte but that's what makes places like Zizis stand out. I'm still exploring their menu but so far some of my favorites are there \"fish\" and chips, \"meat loaf\" and \"chickn parm\". Man o man! The flavor of this food is amazing and I'd be cheating you if I didn't tell you to order the fries with the \"special\" seasoning. Normal fries just won't do! Biggest tip of all is to CALL YOUR ORDER IN. It'll save you some precious wait time because it takes longer than a minute to make amazing vegan food! Thumbs Up!\n\nSincerely,\n\nOne Happy Vegan!
