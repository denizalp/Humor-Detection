Oh Bouchon, I love you. \n\nThe d√©cor of this place is classy, chic with an elegant French vibe. The stunning views from the expansive windows were enough to keep me occupied while I waited for our food. \n\nI came here for brunch and everything I ordered was delicious. \n\nFirst, they brought us fresh artisan bread with butter and jam that was utterly delicious. I've never tasted bread this good. \n\nThen, we ordered bloody Mary's that were to die for! A perfect hint of spice and flavor. I sipped this down all too quick. \n\nI ordered the Saumon Fume, which is smoked salmon with tomatoes, capers, red onion, and chive cream cheese on a petite French baguette. For such a simple meal, I was overwhelmingly elated with the high quality of the ingredient. I loved every bite of it. The salmon was fresh and the capers with red onion added a nice complement to the meal. By the end, I was full but in a healthy way. \n\nMy mom ordered the filet mignon omelette of the day and she loved it. It came with bacon and a toasted brioche.\n\nMy sister ordered the sausage hash with poached eggs and she loved it! I had a bite and it was delicious. I would definitely come back and order it. \n\nWe also ordered the Lyonnaise potatoes. Although I didn't get a chance to try them, my mom and sister said they were really good. \n\nThis is an excellent brunch option in Vegas and I will definitely be coming back here now that I found this gem.
