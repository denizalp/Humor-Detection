Okay I  know I am little early , the fair hasn't arrived this year yet. But I  am going make myself vulnerable and show something not many know about me. I love the fair. \n\nYes once a year I get all worked up with excitement to see and do the fair. What you might wonder would I  like about the fair. The fair is my mental through back to a time not unlike that of a dear pig named Wilbur. \nI love the thought of canning foods, raising goats and rabbits, eating turkey legs and  staring at carnies. \n\nI have even convinced my family to join me in this and we have now a tradition. We eat , walk, the kids ride rides, and we gawk and wonder .\nI have even gotten my daughter to enter the baking competitions with me. Tee Hee.\n\nI have to admit the fair is not for everyone. It has it's downsides and definitely gets scarier the closer to the weekend you are.But each year I  feel warmly , tingly, going thru all my pre fair rituals.  Lots of money ,check.  sturdy walking shoes, check.  empty belly for strange food wonders, check. \n\nThe fair is just around the corner. Friday, October 10 - Sunday, November 2 , see you there.
