Horrible. I recently moved here and went to get my hair colored, it was awful. My highlights were 10 different colors. My hair is simple and one color- shouldn't have been difficult to highlight. I went back for a correction and left with it looking worse. Both times the stylist blamed my hair for the color. NO. Will no be returning. My cut was good, but if you want a skilled colorist, try somewhere, anywhere else.
