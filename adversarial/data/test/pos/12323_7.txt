Disappointed all around. From beginning to end. It started with checking in. We arrived on a Friday AM at 9ish. My friend is an Mlife card holder which gives you a separate VIP check in line. They told us that they don't open that line until 9am and sometimes 10am... Which is it?! \n\nAfter waiting 45 minutes in the other line we were told it was an extra $28 for early check in. Who charges extra?? According to my friends Mlife card they quoted a $20 fee for early check in, but we were told that was an online check in only and wouldn't apply. Whatever that means... \n\nOur room was basic, which was to be expected. I wasn't expecting MGM style. But it wasn't even properly cleaned! There was a substance on the bathroom wall, and I found a piece of candy on the floor clearly from the last guest. Gross. And there was no fridge. I don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel without a fridge. \n\nI went to get ice one afternoon and a police officer asked me to move so he could check behind the soda machine. He was clearly looking for someone! Didn't exactly make me feel warm and fussy! And we saw Las Vegas PD on our floor two more times later that day! WTF?! \n\nOverall the service was subpar, the room was outdated and not clean, and we didn't even feel safe at one point! Two thumbs down... Won't be back...
