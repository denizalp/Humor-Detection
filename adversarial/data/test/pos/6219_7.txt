We were on the verge of purchasing counter stools when we noticed one of the chairs had what looked like a small tear on the Naugahyde from removal of scotch tape that had been used to hold a price sheet in place.  When we pointed it out to the sales person, she said she could repair it and walked off.  We waited several minutes for her to return.  We then noticed she was servicing another customer.  When we asked about the chair repair, she rudely responded:  \"Well, we have other customers besides you.\"  At that, we walked out on a potential sale of over $1,000.
