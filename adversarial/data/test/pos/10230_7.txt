1st I would like to say: \n\"IF YOUR GONA CRY, GO TO CHURCH\" \n\"YOU GOT TO PAY TO PLAY... ITS VEGAS BABY...\" \n\nI hate all these reviews about how its so expensive... id rather go here or here or here... for the amount we spent its not worth it....Your in Vegas everything is gona cost money, go to a cheap buffet if your broke... \n\nAs for Serendipity I loved the place. We started out the the Chicken Nachos, I ordered the One-Eyed Jack and we finished with the Outrageous Banana Split (Coward's Portion). All was awesome. I loved them each. The Nachos were huge and the Sandwich was even bigger and extra tasty the Banana Split was everything you can hope for and the Cowards portion was big enough for my wife and I. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be sure to come back here for more. \n\nMy advice to those who want to try this place is DO NOT GO ON A BUDGET... DON'T CHEAT YOUR SELF TREAT YOUR SELF
