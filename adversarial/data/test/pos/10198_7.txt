Complete ripoff place.  Bait and switch,  do not go here.    I found a coupon online for free car wash and $3 off.\n\nI wait 10 mins online.   The guy starts  giving me directions to reverse.   I follow.   He makes faces.   He says \"do what the last car did,  It's not that hard! \"  \n\nI say \"i wasnt watching the other car,  why don't you just tell me? \"  guy is a total jerk. \n\nWhen it comes time to pay,  i show him the coupon on my phone.  He says \"you need to print out the coupon or it doesn't apply.  It's only $3.\"\n\nI ask no free car wash?   He says \"nope! \"\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS RIPOFF PLACE.
