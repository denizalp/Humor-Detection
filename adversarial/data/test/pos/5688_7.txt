Well, what can I say about health care in Calgary. It turns out its not as bad as everyone says. At least not from my experience last Friday.\n\nI was riding my bike through a parking lot and hit one of those parking block things and went for a tumble.  I got up and dusted myself off and realized my shoulder was sore and making a crunchy, grinding kinda sound and it hurt.\n\nSo off to the Peter Lougheed I go. After waiting about 1\/2 hour in the emergency room then an hour wait to get  an X-ray and another hour for the doctor. He diagnosed my problem as a broken collar bone ( DUH , I could have told him that)  I was on my way home within 3 hours with a sling and some pain killers.\nI've heard all the horror stories when other people go to Emerg. and I'm sure it does happen but all the staff were very nice and considerate to me.\nI might have just got lucky or it was just a slow night.
