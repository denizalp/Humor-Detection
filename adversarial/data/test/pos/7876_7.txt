This is a great spot for quality fashion without the steep prices. They have a good selection of women's wear well departed separated by categories such as work wear, dresses, petites, plus sizes, and sweaters. There are plenty of helpful workers that are more than happy to help you find what you are looking for and even help you put an outfit together for just about any occasion. The shoe selections are great as well. Brands such as Tory Burch, Michael Kors, and Cole Haan are readily available. Prices, to me, are much more discounted at the store than online. So if you have meaning to buy a snazzy pair of Tory Burch flats, but didn't want to go for broke you should definitely give this place a look. \n\nThe accessory section is limited, but there is decent variety of purses, clutches, and costume jewelry to get a look together. The  necklaces, rings, and bracelets were not your Forever 21 kind of style, neither is the price. I would say it is still very affordable, but the quality makes up for it. \n\nThere is also a men's section that seemed really popular too. I saw a lot of guys checking out the shirt section and actually heading to the Fitting Room. Style ranges from classic button ups to casual polos and tees. Brand names again line the racks and the prices are well discounted from the suggested retail price you would find at the store. Check out is very efficient as they have mobile registers where they can print you a receipt or just email to you. The best part about this Nordstrom Rack is their quality customer service. They are always smiling and checking to see of you need help. I bought an evening dress one time and they put it on a hanger with the plastic protective cover on it. How nice! For a discount store, it is never messy and always organized. The clothes with correct sizes are where they should be making it less stressful trying to find your size. Shopping can be overwhelming at times, but this place makes it's enjoyable. Highly recommend!
