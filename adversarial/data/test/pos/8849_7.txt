Luxor is supposed to be one of the hottest hotels on the strip but it kind of fell flat for me. I think it's cool that it's a pyramid and the inside is nice but hot... don't really see it. I know Criss Angel, a show called Fantasy (half naked women shaking it), and Carrot Top (dude kind of creeps me out) are performing there but does that make it hot??? Though it does have the strongest beam of light on this planet (make you wonder, where do you think aliens will go to first). It was cool to see but stay there, probably not.
