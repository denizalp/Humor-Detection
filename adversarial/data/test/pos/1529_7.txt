Great new concept and was pretty excited since the food scene in Phoenix needs to be changed up and refreshed a bit. Who doesn't like grilled cheese?\n\nTempted to sort out the mixed reviews on Yelp and see what Toasted was really about, I decided to stop in with my friend for lunch. \n\nToasted is located on 7th Ave, Melrose, with parking located in the back with its private lot. The shop itself is pretty large and has a very rustic, \"home\" vibe with its pillows lining the window seating, open kitchen, flowers on every table and chalkboard wall decor.\n\nAfter looking at their menu of sandwiches that you can have with fries, soup and dipping sauces to drinks and dessert, I found that there was a good selection but not too overwhelming. I decided on the Jalapeno Popper, which came with cream cheese, pepper jack cheese, thick cut bacon and roasted pepper. I decided to get the fries, which are beer battered, instead of a soup ... because well they're fries!\n\nBe forewarned, the wait for food is pretty intense. It made question, how long does it really take to make a grilled cheese. Plus there were about two tables ahead of us and the food came out, maybe 15-20 min after. By the time the food came to the table, my sandwich was not hot at all, but remained \"gooey\" from the cream cheese I'm guessing and my fries were lukewarm. Not really impressed by the fries, good crisp, but without the beer batter I would compare them to that of Red Robin's fries. The sandwich was good, being a Jalapeno Popper fanatic, I appreciated the spice, the saltiness of bacon and creaminess of the cream cheese. I wasn't a huge fan of the toast, found it to be more on the soggy side and wished it were more \"toasted. I also think that they could do better with another choice of bread, definitely something more substantial that can handle being toasted and with a good chew. Price point is a bit steep for sandwiches and fries, but I suppose that's the novelty of eating out at a place specifically serving up just grilled cheeses.\n\nOverall, they have a great idea! It just needs to be refined. With a better service system to get food out quickly would be great! The wait staff was pleasant, it was just the timing of service and temperature of food, as well as a bit of the cost.\n\n+ Also, obviously this is not for those for clean meals or those worried about their dietary concerns, it's grilled cheese aka comfort food y'all! TBH, I did have to take a nap after dining here.
