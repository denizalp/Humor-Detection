I just realized I've been coming to this place for a long time and never rated or reviewed it. Shame on me!\n\nMost people will just drive by this place and never look twice because of where it's located. Well, you're missing out. Diamonds in the rough need a polishing before they look as good as they do in the store and this place is definitely a gem. Even though its called Real Donuts (and trust me, they are REAL donuts) it's got traditional Mexican pastries and they make some of the most amazing Subs I've tasted in this town. Yes, their Sub sandwiches are not only on-point put made with real fresh items and priced perfectly. You can either get their sandwiches in an america sub version or a Torta version which is awesome. Their chicken sandwich has REAL chicken. I mean I don't know how else to describe this place. You just have to try it. The bread they use for the sandwiches is freshly baked in house. And its freaking scrumptious!\n\nNow for the donuts, my freaking God! These donuts are the best I have ever had. And that says quite a bit because I love donuts, I mean that look like I love donuts, but trust me I love donuts. Krispy Kreme? Dunkin Donuts? Not even close! I grew up in New York where there are lots of pastry joints and hundreds of Hispanic style pastry shops and again I'll tell you I have not had donuts better than this. One of their gimmicks is that they make these enormous sugar glaze and bear claws donuts and regular donuts. I mean these things are massive. Take two or three to the office and feed the whole place. Of course I'm exaggerating but seriously, their huge.\n\nYou gotta try this place at least once, I promise you'll come back again.
