Another new hike checked off the list.  With Elnino F. as our guide, a group of us headed off on a beautiful Saturday morning to tackle the Staircase.  Its name is not misleading:  it's grand and the rock formations are like steps along the way.  Some of the steps are easy and some are steep, with a lot of scrambling like Spiderman involved.  It took us about 45 minutes to get to the top, but that included breaks, i.e. photo opportunities, along the way.\n\nTIPS:\n- I learned from my last hike at Icebox Canyon to wear longer pants because of the brush, so this time I had hiking capris on.  I also brought gloves, which came in very handy with all the scrambling.\n- Don't forget hydration, sunscreen, snacks.  Again, a Camelbak is what I use, but any kind of small backpack will do so your hands are free to climb.\n- If you're afraid of heights, don't do this hike.  You should do this hike if you want to see some awesome views of Red Rock and Las Vegas, even if it reveals the smog layer!\n- When you get to the top, bask in the vistas, take pictures, chill out, enjoy the silence. \n- On the way up and down the Staircase, beware of loose rocks so you don't twist an ankle.  Take your time and you'll survive without any mishaps, like we did. \n\nBe safe and happy hiking!
