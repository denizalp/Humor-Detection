Located in the A concourse between gates A5 and A7, this Wendy's has the usual menu of burgers and salads and even baked potatoes! Service is super snappy and efficient. Small seating area nearby and of course, you're welcome to bring your burger with you on the plane.\n\nMy recommendation? A double with cheese and no pickles. And if you really want to be the highlight of someone's flight, get some extra onions up in that!
