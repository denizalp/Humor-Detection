I've been working and living in downtown Calgary for just over two years.  On my first day, my supervisor was naming off his favourite lunch joints in the area.  Holy Grill was one of them.  On my second day, we headed there to silence the sound of our rumbling stomachs and I found out why.\n\nHoly Grill has some deliciously crafted paninis.  The Sicilian has been my sandwich of choice for quite some time.  And as another review noted, their yam fries are indeed to die for.\n\nThe staff aren't just friendly, their small town friendly.  If you've ever experienced that rural kind of service and hospitality you'll know what I'm referring to.  \n\nGive them a go but either arrive early or ensure you have a bit of time to wait during a lunch hour because this is a popular spot.
