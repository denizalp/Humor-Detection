One star because there's no option of no star. This is a place that leaves a bad taste starting from the hostess. It was a nice 1\/3 Friday noon that one thinks it must be nice to sit at a patio overlooking the Strip people traffic. There were at least 4 girls at the entrance (not sure if they all were hosts). Separate lines for patio versus inner sitting. When asked how long will wait be for patio \"45 mins to an hour, sit inside no wait\". OMG, rude! When I decided to sign up for patio, given a pager, \"don't walk past the white bridge\/stairs, and no outside coz no signal\". Rude the second time. Finally it's my turn to be sitted. \"Are all of you here yet? if not, you have to wait till all of you here\" \"My friend is not coming, just myself.\" Hostess face twitched. \"Well, you'll have to wait for 1 person table\" What is the difference between 1 or 2 person table. At that point, I decided to leave, no turn back.\n\nIt's true that Vegas the Strip is famous travel destination, but customers are not chopped liver, especially having to pay insane double to triple prices for mediocre food one can find in other metro areas. I'm done with Vegas, not coming back in several years. Or will not dine at the Strip!
