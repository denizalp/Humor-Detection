Gahhh I love this place so much that I feel the need to review it, even though it already has 94 other reviews which clearly outline how awesome St Lawrence Market really is.\n\nVisiting on Saturdays is a MUST as this is the only day the North Market area is open. My favourite vendors at the North Market:\n\nEl Gaucho Chorizos - WOW...total sausage fest. This vendor has over 50 kinds of sausages. The honey garlic ones are delicious and I've also tried some of their lamb ones. I keep trying something new each time.\n\nBest BAA (lamb products, obviously) This place claims to have the best Ontario lamb around. I bought my lamb chops here for Easter dinner and they were lovely. They also do a lot of goats\/ewe cheese varieties.\n\nGrainfields - delicious baked goods, many gluten-free cakes, cookies and bread.\n\nThe south market is awesome too, but it is mostly meat, seafood and specialty items there. Not as much produce, although there are a few fruit & veg vendors there too.\n\nThis place puts other farmers markets to shame. Bravo, Toronto
