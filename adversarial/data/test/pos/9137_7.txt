Ulta Beauty Located on Rainbow- Las Vegas NV.\n\nStore location- Meh, kinda shady.\n\nStore was clean.\n\nSome parts of the store lacked organization given the amount of staff. (It wasn't busy either) I seen ONE girl organizing the shelves only.\n\nProduct availability was good.\n\nStaff at registers had MAJOR  attitude.  Attitude was displayed when asking a question.\n\nQuestion-  \"As far as redeeming rewards?\"\n\nAnswer- \"You tell us when you want to redeem (I guess they will never ask) added in her answer \" Use them before Dec 31st or Rewards Expire!\"  \n\nGood to know! Even though my email from Ulta said Platinum members rewards DO NOT expire. Hmmm? Will have to check further.\n\nFurthermore, based on the lack of knowledge, lack of friendly communication skills, and lack of customer service, I would NOT recommend this location.\n\n Check the other Ulta Beauty locations Summerlin or Durango locations are really good! :)
