I came here for the first time. I wanted to go to the girl I normally visit at another location. But, she is always booked. Of course because, she is fantastic.\nAnyway ,I called this location and they got me in with a masseuse that fit my time and needs.\nHis name was Juan. He did a great job with pressure and avoiding my neck. \nThe front staff was very helpful when I came in. They had me fill out paperwork ( as I had never visited this location before) .\nThey directed me to the relaxation room which was cool and dark and had water. Which is a nice way to wind down.\nEverything was very clean inside here,including the restrooms.\nThe only thing I am not crazy about here,is the parking. Tempe Market place is like crazy town for parking. Which has nothing to do with Massage Envy. But, I am just saying be careful in the parking lot. Crazy drivers are all over here.
