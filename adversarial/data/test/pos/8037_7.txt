I just think it's funny how I came to this location before visiting the one closer to me. We were excited to try out some lemonade and my friend wanted one of their mason jars so she got one, and I did too so that I'd be motivated to come back and save $.50 on my drink. The menu is impressive and expansive; so many drinks, bowls and toast options. I went with the strawberry mint lemonade and the chili lime avocado toast, and with the glass jar it was pretty pricey but worth saving some money on future visits. \n\nThe staff was super accommodating and helpful with recommendations. I love that everything is locally sourced and they don't use syrups or unnatural ingredients. We wanted to sit outside and one of the managers wiped down the table for us from the rain, a kind gesture. Our drinks were made quickly as was my toast. I liked my lemonade, it was on the tart side which I prefer and the mint wasn't strong but it added a lil something. The jar is super cute so I'm looking forward to reusing it at home and by bringing it in on my future visits. The toast was delicious, simple but packed with flavor and the multigrain toast was a nice touch. I'm glad to see them expand and will be sure to visit their flagship AZ location and try other flavors and açaí bowls.
