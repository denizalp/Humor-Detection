If you're a fan of hand-pulled noodles, Marugame Monzo is arguably the king of hand-crafted udon. The menu features a number of different preparations of udon including hot, cold, bukkake (cold noodles with broth), or the flavor-rich signature dishes. While I found the texture of the udon to be perfect, the broths and preparations were very hit or miss. Of the signature udons, the miso carbonara was rich and flavorful, but was quite heavy with the creamy white sauce and bacon. On the other hand, I also tried the duck nanban, which had deliciously tender pieces of duck, but the broth was so light and lacked any flavor once the few pieces of duck were gone. Double portions of udon are an extra $2, but cannot be applied to any of the signature udons. \n\nOther than noodles, they also feature some traditional appetizers including takoyaki (octopus balls), and fried chicken. Another shortcoming of Monzo is the hot tea, which only comes in a can. However, the service was good and fast and I've never had to endure a wait for seating. The only struggle would be to find parking on a busy night in this plaza.
