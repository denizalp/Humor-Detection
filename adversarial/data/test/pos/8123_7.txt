I was at Prunelle last night for a friend's birthday and had a lovely experience. We felt the food was delicious and about what we were expecting to pay - under $50 per person for 2 or 3 courses each, not including the wine we brought ourselves. Everyone yummed a lot, from the spicy steak tartar, to the mushrooms with truffle oil, to the magret de canard, to the bison ribs with polenta fries, roast rabbit, all the way through to the perfect crème brûlée that arrived with a surprise sparkler for our birthday girl. \n\nWe had no service issues. Sunday in early, snowy March we had the place almost to ourselves. Nobody rushed us and we felt well taken care of in this chill, chic joint by the Duluth cobblestones.
