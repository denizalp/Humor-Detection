3.5 stars ... its actually good for Mississauga but I felt this particular location was chaotic with the parking and it's a bit slow.\n\nChatime is another international big brand for bubble tea that landed in the GTA.  I knew of Chatime when it first went into the GTA East and I've seen it a few times in busy spots like Square One.  I totally forgot it was in Mississauga until my yelp search had it pop up.  This location is just ... crazy.  It's a strip mall off the super busy intersection of Mavis and Burnhampthorpe.  Even on a late afternoon before the after dinner rush, the parking lot was completely filled and there was a constant rush of cars coming in and out.  \n\nThe store itself is one of the larger spots I've seen... there's at least 10 tables where you can sit after ordering.  The decor is the brand standard of white walls, light wooden touches, and the bold purple as being the key colour.  The ordering area was busy with a few people... maybe 2 people in the line up before us.  There was a decent amount of staff. I spied at least 5 different people.  Service here is not quite efficient.  For that many staff, I would hope teas would be made quicker than waiting around for 10 minutes.  Even the people before us with an order of one tea... still at least 10 minutes.\n\nOne thing I did think was cute... they've got a promo right now.  For an order of 2 drinks, you get a lucky 'purple' pocket with different prizes.  We got the basics of buy one get the second for $0.88.  It's a nice touch for the upcoming Chinese New Year.\n\nChatime milk tea (hot) - I've had a few hot milk teas from the past few brands.  I felt this one was a bit more diluted than the other stores out there.  Though I got this half sweet, it was still a kick of sugar with a lighter black tea flavour.  I like if it had more of a robust black tea so this one was good but not great.  3.5\/5\n\nCoffee Slushie - Another decent drink but I found here the flavour wasn't as good as others spots in the GTA West.  A touch too light on the coffee flavour.  At 30% sweetness, this was one of the more balanced drinks.  I know this is a slushie so you have to use ice to make it a slush but I found this was a lot of iced used.  I felt they just overloaded it with possibly too much ice... after finishing off the drink, there was ice slush half the cup size left in it. 3.5\/5\n\nChatime milk tea with boba - Similar to the hot chatime milk tea, its a pretty decent tea with a lighter flavour.  I think there was a good amount of bubbles given and if anything, I probably finished the drink before the bubbles.  The bubbles was actually nicely cooked... chewy and touch sweet.   3.5\/5\n\nBrown Sugar milk tea - I honestly couldnt tell that much of a difference from the chatime milk tea.  I felt this one was just maybe a touch more of a caramel flavour that the regular chatime milk tea.  Similar to the others... definitely lacking on the good tea note.  It was good but could be better.  3.5\/5\n\nOverall, its a decent spot but only during the slow times... I cannot imagine trying to get in and out of this place (and the store) when it's dinner time or right after dinner. It would be a crazy nightmare and the wait for parking and your drink would be crazy.
