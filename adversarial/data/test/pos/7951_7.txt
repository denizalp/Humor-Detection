Decided to give BBQ King a try after seeing it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. I was really wanting to like this place. It looked cool on the show and the fried BBQ chicken was supposed to be the best. Complete failure the moment we arrived. I pressed the button on the 1950s speaker system to order and the lady snapped on the other side was about as rude as rude gets. \"I can't hear you\" in a rude hateful voice. I wondered if I was in Charlotte or NYC. I had to contain myself from pulling her through that speaker system. Wow lady, the speaker system is from the 50s, no wonder you couldn't hear me. What I wanted was a BBQ fried chicken sandwich, but what I got was BBQ grilled tenders sandwich. Meat was too salty and the hush puppies were just ok, nothing good. Def won't be going back.
