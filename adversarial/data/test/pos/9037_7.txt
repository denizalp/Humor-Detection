When we walked in it was a little confusing as to who was going to seat us. A guy came up immediately and sat us down. One of the waitresses was standing talking to a guy and blocking one of the seats so we had to wait for a minute for them to move.\n\nWe sat down and looked at the menu and decided what we wanted to drink. So, we waited. It was Friday night and busy so we figured a server would be by shortly. We waited, we looked at the menu again and decided on food, so by the time a server showed up we could order everything at once. We shut our menus and waited. Still nothing. Serveral servers passed us in the 20 minutes that we sat there and no one even came by to acknowledge us. Not a \"Be with you in just a minute\" NOTHING. So we got up and left and since we were invisable no one even noticed.\n\nWe definitely wont be coming back.
