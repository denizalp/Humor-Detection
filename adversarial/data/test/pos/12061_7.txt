I rather drive to a location across town then come to this Einstein Bagels.\nThey had 5 workers including 2 supervisors, they were all confused and did not understand what to do. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the lox bagel with extra capers and a side of potato salad along with a strawberry lemonade. They were busy so I didn't mind waiting a bit longer on their slow service but the workers were just rude.\n\nWe got here around 11 on Saturday and they were mostly out of their bagels with a handful of bagels. As we go your bagels, they did not put extra capers and forgot out salad and drink. They looked at us as if we were idiots when we were waiting for the rest of our food. The potato salad was already premade and they just had to take it out of the fridge but they made us wait another 5 minutes. Our drink took another 5-10 minutes, probably would have been finished with our meal if we didn't wait. \n\nJust don't waste your time coming to the location.
