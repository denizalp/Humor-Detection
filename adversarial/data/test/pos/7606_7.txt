This is my first and last time to the River Rat EVER!!!  It's Saturday, October 10, 2015 at 10pm and the food and service we received tonight is unacceptable! Everything started with a 6.30pm RSVP that we showed up 5min early for.  To make a long story short appetizers took 30 minutes (they gave my bruschetta to another table and took another 15 minutes to remake) salads took another 15 minutes after appetizers ... everyone got a salad but my fianc√©!\nWe let the server know another 10-15 minutes later when she finally came back. The server leaves and literary a second later all of our food comes out. We still had soup coming and the food was at the table.  We asked that the food be taken back and the server tells us and I quote \"I don't want to take the food back because it will sit under the HEAT LAMPS!\"  I immediately asked for the manager...5 minutes later a food stained cook comes out of the kitchen, greets our table, and says and I quote \"I hear there's a problem here what's going on?\"  I explained to him what happened and the cook\/manager said and I quote \"I'll keep it warm under the HEAT LAMPS!!!\"  Un-Flipping believable \"I informed him to take the food back, let us eat our salads, go get our soup course, and re-cook our food so everything was fresh!\nWouldn't you expect \"all\" the food you ordered in the \"correct order\" you ordered it in, in a timely manner?  \nWe finally get our food by like 7:50 I cut into my Cajun Medium\/Rare steak look at it and take a bite.  I knew immediately the food wasn't fresh.  1st my steak had NO Cajon seasoning on it, 2nd a mid-Rare steak has a warm red center and my steak was pink on one side and well\/done on the other!!!  Proving the cook\/manager had no clue of what he was doing and just sat our food back under a heat lamp because he didn't want to re-cook it!!! The other 3 meals were lukewarm.  Cook-said-manager comes back out and lies to my face again about re-cooking our food so that it was all fresh and not food that sat under a heat lamp for 30 minutes.  None of us could even eat our food because it wasn't cooked right and it wasn't even warm. By far the worst dining experience I've ever had in my life.\nSunday Morning - October 11, 2015.....\nSo I decided to get a good night's rest and review what I wrote last night (something I've never done before)...you know to read through everything with a clear head.  I want to add that it has been years since I was treated so poorly by a manager. He still forced us to pay for 2 of the 4 inedible meals... almost $100 for drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 inedible meals, a worthless server, and a so-called cook\/manager lying to my face and fighting with us in front of other customers!  Totally embarrassing and demeaning to myself and my family and a complete waste of money!\nMonday Afternoon - October 12, 2015.....\nI called back to the restaurant and spoke with the front of house manager (who was not there Saturday night).  I re-explained everything that happened Saturday night to her.  The manager apologized about what happened and told me that the food stained cook that was fighting with me in front of other dinners Saturday night was in fact not only the manager, not only the head cook, but he was also one of three owners.  The front of house manager was very nice and understanding, but never offered to refund us for the horrible experience.  I had asked the front of house manager to talk to the other two owners and have them call me.  She said that they own other restaurants and wouldn't be in until Thursday (10-15-15), but she would personally make sure they got my complaint and would have them call me to fix everything.\nMonday Morning - October 26, 2015.....\nTwo weeks later I still haven't heard from anyone from The River Rat Restaurant forcing me to dispute the charges on my credit card, and file a complaint with the South Carolina State Attorney Generals office!!!  I would not want my worst enemy to go through what I have experienced at The River Rat Restaurant, and I will NEVER be back!!!!\nDecember 4, 2015....UPDATE\nI have an open case with consumer protection. Several letters were sent to the restaurant, from consumer protection, and all of them were returned. 10 days ago I drove back to the River Rat took pictures of the address on the front of the building and sent them along with copies of their business card off to consumer protection. While I was there that day I went inside and let the bartender photocopy my receipt from the night in question along with the letter I received from consumer protection, and left my cell number. My case worker emailed the official complaint to the email address on the business card. Again that was 10 days ago and still nothing....kinda at a loss for words at this point! It saddens me that anyone in the business of serving the public would act in such a way!
