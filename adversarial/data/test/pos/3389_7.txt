Forgot to take picture my bad lol.\n\nBut this place is awesome. Don't see why some of 2 stars are complaining so much. This is Vegas!! Pricing of food is high everywhere come on now.\n\nFood was good and the service was great!!! Your cup was filled up before it was below half way, if you got up to use the restroom the waiter would come by and fix\/fold your napkin. The guys were on it. We had a party of 12 so I made a reservation just on case. They had a waiter on each side of the table taking the orders which was cool, and at the end of the meal the waiter asked if we wanted separate checks. I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nEveryone was treated great and I would recommend coming here. Steak was good, pizza was good, ravioli was good and the burger was good lol.
