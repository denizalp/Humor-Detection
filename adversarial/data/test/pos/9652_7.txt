My coworker, Tiffany talked highly of this place after I mentioned how my beloved computer stopped working. I took her recommendation and went here the next day in hopes they could save my computer & bring it back to life. \n\nThis business is located on S. Fort Apache Rd., on your right side, just passed W, Hacienda Ave. The first time I came here the staff was very helpful in looking up the part my computer needed. One of the staff member special ordered the new power supply, since my computer is a Shuttle & it isn't used much these days. The part came in quick & in a few days my computer was ready to pick up. I was overjoyed when they called me :) When I picked it up, I felt like how you would pick up your dog from the vet after a few days of hospital stay from being sick. My heart was racing. This self built computer means the world to me. One Christmas, a very long time ago, I watched my boyfriend built computers for his clients, but he also did it, because he enjoyed it. One night, he asked me what I would like for Christmas & for some reason after witnessing the joy that it gave him in building one.. I asked if he could build me one. His eyes lit up like a Christmas tree & asked if I wanted a cute one or mean one. Cute one!!! And that's how my Shuttle came about. Life turns on you when you least expect it & sadly, that was the last thing he made for me before cancer took his life. \n\nI cried walking out of this place with my Shuttle fixed & working like new. Having the thought that it might not ever work again troubled my heart. \n\nOver a year later, I swear I wasn't surfing anything naughty. I swear! I was reading reviews on the new Iphone 7 specs & out of nowhere my computer froze. I restarted it, but it gave me a black screen with an error message of the file is missing or corrupted, please add the file to start your computer. I took it in the next day & Tae helped me with what could be wrong with it & advise me to install a newer version of Windows while backing up all my data. I agreed & he called me the very next day to let me know my computer was ready to pick up. Tae took the time to go over everything he did, made sure my sound worked, showed me how to clean, defragment, and use my new home version Windows 7. After work that same day, I realized my wireless network wasn't connecting at all. I became restless. I tried numerous attempts to fix it myself, but frustration got the best of me & I wanted to rip my forehead open with my nails. I calmly took a breath, shut off my computer, & headed straight to my freezer. Opened and threw the lid in the kitchen sink and ate half a carton of Pistachio Gelato. Cooled me off. The next morning I called Tae to see what the problem was. He didn't know I had a wireless adapter.. told me to bring it back & he'll fix it for me. I had to work that day & he said no worries we're open 7 days a week come anytime. \n\nI went there before work on Sunday.. yes they're open on Sunday! Chuck assisted me right away when I walked in. A few minutes later, Tommy came in and took over. He was expeditious and updated my netgear as well as my printer software to have it function properly. Even gave me a tip on photo editing software that is similar to my outdated one. I went home relieved and happy to have it finally fixed. \n\nI hooked everything back into my Shuttle & now it's asking for a username & password. I called Tommy & he talked me through it until he knew someone had to come to my house to get it fixed. He said it's something really simple, glitch somewhere that just needed to be tweaked. He asked how far I was to the store & said he can send a staff or himself. In less than 30 mins. he was at my doorstep. Now that's going above & beyond in guest service. \n\nIt fascinates me how well someone knows about technology. Pure Genius. I couldn't even recall all the steps he went through. It only took a minute to get it working and I was mortified when my Mom came out in her bra and panties walking like Bigfoot. She paused and stared at Tommy, thinking it was my Brother playing a joke and surprising her. I told her the computer guy is stopping by, but she misinterpreted that I was going to stop by there. I stood still, acting like I'm listening to Tommy explain what I need to do, but I was giving my Mom the \"WTF you crazy, put on some freakin' clothes!!!\" look. I even motioned my lips to get the heck out of here. I'm damn sure he saw her, but kept his composure. \n\nNow my Shuttle is working like brand new. No more having to refresh my wireless adapter and wait a few minutes to connect to the Internet. Once I press a key button to wake my computer up, it's internet ready and FAST! So happy :) It feels real good to know you're well taken care of here. They also have free boxes for shipping, mail box rent, ink cartridges, passport photos, notary public, color & B\/W copies, video tape to DVD, fax, & so much more! Again, thank you for bringing my computer back to life!
