Consistency issues .... BIG TIME...\n\nI know every cow is different but how come at Schwartz's in Mtl or Katz's in NY they don't have consistency issues.. You know why??? Because they are a REAL deli.\nMy first visit the smoked meat medium was perfect.... Tender, Juicy, meaty , melt in my mouth perfection.\nNext time with same order meat was chewy and fatty, so we tried again, same thing, so we tried again, same thing,,, finally my eating buddy and I gave them one last chance.,, same thing.. Chewy meat, not tender ,. Not good...\nAnd the sorry excuse for matzo ball soup, I almost cried... The ball was dense , definitely not a floater.. Broth not seasoned... And was that really a homemade chicken broth ? If it was do yourself a favor and leave it on the stove for 2 more hours..\n\nOnce again I'm blown away how the typical Toronto palate has no clue what good food is..\nIn NY or even LA this place wouldn't last for more than a few months.. I guess they do well because they are serving mostly gentile clientele who harsh as it may sound don't truly understand good deli meat.. That being said Celine Dion clearly knows what she's doing in Montreal.\n\nSorry guys... My deli expectations are way higher than what this place can deliver.
