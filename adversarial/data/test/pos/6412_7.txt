On the island of Hawaii (Big Island), we have a saying that it's called ice shave, not shave ice (which Oahu has that saying), and it's been a generation long argument on what the correct term.    Ainokea, because it's Shave ice or the other way around, but it was the Big Islanders who made up the Mauna Kea Snow idea in the first place.    So it's all us...lol.     At least this place took away the age long question, and just called it self Beach Bums Hawaiian Ice.   \n\nOne of my friends told me about this place, and it's located at the intersection of Mission and Horizon Ridge.    I was quite surprised, because it's way cheaper than the rest of other Shave ice place in the area, and their machines does grind down pretty good.   The only negative, their shave ice machine is a little small, so does take a little while for your order to arrive.  \n\nBeach bums does have most of the flavors, and ice cream or sweet cream options for .50 extra.   Also , there four different size that range from 2.00 to 5.00.\n\nFor those of you who don't know what Mauna Kea snow is...it's not some pineapple colored snow from somebody taking a break; but it's the condense sweet cream topping that goes on top of the confections .\n\nIf you come here around 7 pm, you'll be waiting in a line, but it's well worth it if you're in the neighborhood.
