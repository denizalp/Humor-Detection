I've been going back to Swizzlesticks for years... mostly because I'm too scared to go anywhere else!\n\nSALON: I've seen a handful of different stylists since 2003; some have moved away, some have been unavailable, some have been disappointing.  However, right now I'm seeing a stylist that I'm pretty happy with.  The staff here all have different prices based on their education and experience, however as a previous reviewer mentioned higher prices don't always mean higher quality.  If one stylist doesn't work out for you, call back and see someone else.  Although I find their prices extremely high (especially relative to salons in my neighbourhood), I feel like Swizzlesticks will always be a safe bet and you never have to worry about leaving unhappy.  I'm willing to pay for that guarantee.\n\nSPA: Exactly what I imagine a Beverly Hills spa would look like... in 1986.  Seriously- the peach tones and faux seascape murals are a major blast from the past.  I went in for a relaxation massage which was more boring than relaxing (especially with all the background noise... I was lying there thinking, \"How is this supposed to be relaxing?  WHAT is that noise?\"), then had a great pedicure (in their AWESOME pedicure chairs!) which lasted for months.  I would say they're great for nail services but have some modernizing to do in other areas.
