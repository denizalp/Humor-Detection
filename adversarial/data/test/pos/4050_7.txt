I forgot all about \"Tuesday Sushi Slurp,\" but we were close and just love the place.  How bad could it be?\n\nCrowded.  Packed.  Waited at the bar half an hour, finally snagged a table.  Here's something I hadn't noticed the first review but have in the dozen or so visits since:  The wait staff is scruffy.  And a bit ill-trained.  A few even appear to be dazed, kinda woozy.  They rotate waiters and bartenders, like they're exactly the same job.  Nuh-uh.  And that's the only real flaw in this otherwise fine grub factory.\n\nIf seems hardly possible that the same folks who run the House in Akron, and the one in Fairlawn also run this one.  This place is so, SO much nicer.  If they could convince the staff to tuck in their shirts, learn the menu, that sort of thing, it would become a destination restaurant.  It ain't that tough.  (I'm never going back on a Tuesday, though.  Every manner of street life was there.  Camo.  Honestly.  Camo, in a restaurant.  And is it even hunting season?)
