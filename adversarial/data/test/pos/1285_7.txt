After hearing so much about this place, on how its a sister place of Sakana on Maryland... and how their fish to rice ratio matches california... definitely had to try it ! \n\nMy friends and I came here after CES. We got out of the convention fairly quick but before long, places all around were being flooding with CES attendees. But it was around dinner time anyway. One of our friends got a table quick and service seemed well. At least my tea was refilled a lot, although it was not very hot tea, and was warm at best. ($1.50 charge for hot tea btw) \n\nPositive notes. Their fish to rice ratio is like 1\/3 of my pinky finger plus a slice of fish the length of my index and middle finger. Fresh wasabi is available (the usual fresh wasabi relish you'd get at places like Goyemon) but a very small amount. Salmon belly was good. Ocean trout is good. Probably due to not being overly cold and drenched in sauce. Tamago was uniquely made and good. \n\nOn other notes. I'm not sure if its because its a \"new\" restaurant or what, but most, if not all the fish, were quite cold. Not like frozen but more cold than the \"body temperature\" it should be at. Almost like it was just taken out of the fridge (not freezer). \n\nThey tend to use a lot of sauces and toppings. In my opinion, not something traditional but may as to mask some things that shouldn't be there. \n\nThey had quite the amount of things which they limit to 1 order per person. We had originally ordered 4 uni, on our first order. We had repeatedly asked to check if it was still coming throughout our meal, they continued to say it was coming. Until near end of the meal, they were like oh we dont have uni today. The waiter who brought us that news had provided up to par service in attempt to please the customers to provide a \"chef special\". What they had given us was a few slices of yellowtail with ponzo sauce. We had asked about their other specials earlier on the meal and they said due to the weather and convention, they were not able to acquire the said \"salmon\" for the salmon carpaccio or salmon tartar. \n\nWe had ordered a few of their \"no rice\" options, also 1 order per person. As said before, lots of sauce. Or even deep fried. One gave myself and others a weird look when we had our first bite. One was wrapped in a quite \"unrefined\" cucumber \"skin\". Thick. Longer than needed. \n\nService overall, mediocre at best. The waitresses seemed a bit clueless and never had a direct answer. Props on keeping my tea filled though. \n\nThe 2 given stars go towards their fish to rice ratio, and the waiter who assisted us at the end.  Everything else? Not so much. Despite the \"limitless\" desserts, the ice cream almost seemed \"pre-scooped\" and overly frozen. Tiramisu was like a brownie. Dense and heavy. Panna Cotta, not available. \n\nDefinitely didnt hold up to the hype ive heard from multiple people. They do \"offer\" a \"limited time deal\" where for a review, you get either a free AYCE dinner or their cup.
