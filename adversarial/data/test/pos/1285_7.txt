I have been going to yc's for years and the experience is always the same.  I would like to compliment the chef (me) about choosing such perfect fresh ingredients into my stir fry bowl.  The sauce was exactly what I wanted since I was the one who made it.  \n\nThe service is always great and the place is clean.  Perfect for lunch or dinner!
