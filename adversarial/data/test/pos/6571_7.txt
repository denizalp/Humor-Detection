I was not \"aware\" that Tea Time had changed over to this hip new coffee shop until a friend posted their Apothecary iced coffee on IG. When I heard about the rose and cardamom-flavored concoction, I knew I had to get one for myself. The clean lines and bare space remind me of coffee joints in SF, quiet and good for working, and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly about providing suggestions.\n\nThe apothecary coffee I had here was stellar- the syrup is made in house and they have a variety of milks to choose from (extra for coconut and almond). Despite the warming temps in Vegas, I opted for the hot drink at the barista's suggestion because he said the flavor was more developed. All I know is that I really enjoyed my drink and will be looking for opportunities to come by this out-of-the-way location again for their bourbon vanilla and mint mojito versions.\n\nTIP: No food menu yet, so grab your coffee to go and pop by Jamboree across the street for a bagel & schmear to complete your morning!
