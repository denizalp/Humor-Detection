I found Deja Vu when I was searching online for spa.  I looked at many places in Goodyear and Phoenix area.  I decided to have my treatment done at  Deja Vu based on feedback's their customers left on line.  The place is really nice and has a real spa feeling.  Great decorations, very clean, the lady at the fron desk was very nice,  I did not have to wait a minute,  they took me in exactly at the time I had my appointment! \n They walked me into the room where I was filling out the paper work and waiting for Jennifer.  Jennifer came in and we engaged  into conversation. I found out we have a lot in common which helped me to build a rapport with her and release my stress quite a bid.  I told her about my previous experiences and I explained to her what my goal is.  She was listening very carefully and addressed all my concerns.\nI was quite happy and I scheduled my next appointment with her,  I got appointment confirmation per text and email. \n My confirmed appointment was on FRI and I got call from them on WED telling me that I can not see Jennifer on FRI because she is not working at the time my appointment was scheduled,  when I mentioned that my appointment is confirmed lady on the phone  started to blame \" a girl\" who made the appointment for the mistake.  There was no apology,  no empathy, no trying to fix the mistake and she never offer any type of  compensation  ( may be symbolic  $10.00 gift card?  - which is a nothing  compare what are you paying at this place for treatment ), small gesture but  huge impact !  \nBecause of them I lost 3 hours vacation time I had already approved - I had to take vacation time in order to be there on FRI - and I can not cancel this anymore.  \nLady was arguing with me,  talking over me and when I asked for manager she stated there is no manager I could talk to.  \nAfter repeatedly requesting to speak to manager  I got on the phone Jasmine Jimenez who claimed to be a manager.  Unfortunately her way to treat the situation was no different.   \nI am extremely disappointed how they disrespect customers and customers time, and with the way they are handling situation when they make mistake.  It seems they do not value their customers and  they don't care if you will use their service or not ( Jasmine Jimenez told me to use another spa !! ) \nIf you are looking for a  place where customers are valued and appreciated, for place which value your business,  if you are looking for a place where customer service is highest priority and customer always come first - this is NOT a spa for you.  \nTheir services are very expensive,  and I always thought you get what you pay for - unfortunately this is not true at Deja Vu Med Spa.
