I'm surprised I haven't been to this place earlier given how often I pass by it. I would call it upscale casual Italian dining. The hosts are quick to welcome you and generally you do not need a reservation. Although I do recommend calling ahead if you do have a specific date\/time in mind because the place can fill up quickly.\n\nFood is traditional Italian fare and they execute it quite well. I recommend the fettuccine alfredo as it is creamy and rich as it's supposed to be. The pizza is classic Neapolitan style. Thin crust, robust Mariana sauce and slices of mozzarella for the topping. The calamari comes to a close second to the best of my calamari experiences. Not chewy, light battered crust and served with lemon. The antipasti is ok. Good to go with wine as it has sliced meats, cheeses and olives. \n\nAmbiance is intimate and would be a good place for a date. Pricing is just a tad high, but I think befitting considering the service is attentive and live music is available on weekends. Highly recommend.
