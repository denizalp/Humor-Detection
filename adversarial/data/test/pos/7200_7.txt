9\/18\n\n98 South is open for business again!  When did this happen?\n\nA friend and I stopped in for a drink and checked out the band and two singers for a bit.  I really liked the female singer- she had lovely strong vocals and danced energetically along to the song.  I only heard her sing once, and her other partner sang to the style of Frank Sinatra, my friend's favorite, for the rest of the time we were there.  \n\nI decided to try the mojito, while my friend ordered a Miller Light.  The bartender, with big blonde hair and a very ample, um, countenance, handed me my drink after a few minutes and had to ask what my pal was having again.  While she retrieved his bottle from the fridge, I tried the mojito.  I wished I hadn't.  It was VERY HEAVY on the mint syrup.  I'm used to drinks made w\/ muddled fresh mint, but if she had used a light hand on the syrup, I probably wouldn't have minded.  I had asked if she'd re-do the drink, and she said \"sure,\" but not w\/out showing her dissatisfaction.  She returned w\/ two glasses- the revised drink and leftovers from the original, should I \"want to have more alcohol.\"  As she handed him his beer, he gave her his credit card, to which she SHOUTED back a \"What do you want to do with this!?\"  He was so taken aback, he had repeated the question and almost retorted back an apt response, but decided against it, just to help speed the transaction along.  \n\nI'm just glad that my companion enjoyed the jazz accompaniment, bec. I felt so bad he had to pay $12 for that terrible mojito drink, which he had me abandon after taking a photo of it.  Lesson learned: Just like with food menu selections, I should find out how they prepare their drinks.  (I really did think that a nice place like this wouldn't cut corners and use such saccharin-sweet syrups...)\n---\n10\/16\n\nJust received an email from \"Iolanda\" who wanted to clarify that \na.)  98 South only serves Bud Light.  Our bad.  My friend did order a Miller Lite, but did have to settle with a Bud light.\nb.)  98 South does not use mint syrup- only fresh mint and simple syrup.  Whatever they used, it was very heavy with too-sweet syrup.  So bad was the experience for my friend that he swears never to try another mojito again.  Not even one made by yours truly- ask the people I served at a party months ago... I can make a decent mojito!\nc.)  She swears her credit card statement went \"What do you want me to do with this?  Go shopping?\"  Sorry, sweetie, but my friend and I both disagree.  In the end, my friend paid $12 for a lousy drink I had to abandon, and you still received a tip, bec. my friend is still a gentleman.  \nd.)  Our bartender's name is Iolanda.
