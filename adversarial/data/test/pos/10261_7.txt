I didn't know what to expect when I walked in at 1st. What can I say?  This place was very peaceful and welcoming. Aj was very helpful with what we were looking for. I liked this location because they carried some variety that the other vape stores didn't carry. For example: I purchased a black eGo case at another location. Several locations I've been to only sell black cases. When I walked into The Lair, I saw blue, red, black... I wished I would have known earlier. I would have purchased a blue one.  RoFL! This location also carries Pink Spot juices and FLAVORZ juices. I live in the South West so I can just hit up The Lair for some Pink Spot juices. ALSO... when I checked in on YELP, I received a FREE drip tip. I was sooooo excited. Who wouldn't be excited about receiving a FREE merchandise!
