I love Spicy and I love Noodle.\n\nHey Noodles just opens at Midland and McNicoll right next to Jim Chai Kee. \n\nThe interior decor is nice and trendy. Clean as it is still new. \n\nMenu is simple with a choice of noodle or rice bowls. You can pick how spicy it is (or non spicy at all) plus the chewiness of noodle (soft or hard). And the best thing is Free additional noodles if you are a bigger eater.\n\nBeef Sirloin Noodle Extra Numb ($10.95) \nThe beef is of good quality and tender!! The noodles has a good bite. And yes it was spicy....... \n\nSince most of the spiciness is by adding chili oil so it can be quite oily. (Pro Tip: Don't play with your phone while eating!!)\n\nDuring lunch hour, it took quite awhile for the food to be ready (+15 minute), I hope you have a long lunch break.\n\nCash and Debit!
