We've had our 2003 Boxster S into Beck's twice for some major work, and I have to say I've never had such a positive experience with a repair shop! Their prices are extremely reasonable, and they do excellent work. \n\nWhen we had a problem with 2nd gear on our transmission, the dealership and another shop I called wanted me to replace the whole tranny (about $5-7k!!) but Beck's realized it was a common problem and not a difficult fix for their technicians (the guy who worked on my car had spent 5+ years as a factory tech in Stuttgart!).\n\nTheir office staff is friendly, the mechanics will come out and explain what they are doing, and the owner Frank is always good about calling if there are any unforeseen problems. Contrast that with the Porsche Dealer in town, I couldn't get the time of day from their \"service managers\" because I wasn't driving a brand new Porsche.\n\nI've also referred a friend for his BMW M3, he said Beck's charged him much less than the dealership for a major repair, and did a great job. If you own a BMW or Porsche and don't take it to Beck's, you're doing it wrong!
