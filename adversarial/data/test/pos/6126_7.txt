OMG!? People pay these prices weekly for food, don't they know almost everywhere else is cheaper, and No Frill's is just down the road less than a five minute drive.\nNeedless to say it wasn't too busy in here, whatever the price of something is add about $.50-$1.50 and that's the Coppa's special. I think we only bought deli meat and milk, milk was on sale for the same price as it is regularly anywhere else.
