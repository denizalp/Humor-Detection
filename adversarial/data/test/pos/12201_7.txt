OMG!  New favorite nearby restaurant!  \n\nHaving driven by it many times, GMonkey finally try. And return 3 more times with more friends to see if I'm not only one who loves this place. We all love it!\n\nOutside is a crowded strip mall, inside is an escape. Dark wooden raised booths, multiple floor table seating for both small and larger groups, super friendly staff every time and food is great!  Lunch specials are perfect. \n\nGMonkey do:\n\nTONKOTSU Combo- ramen, mini chashu, salad, soda = $12\nTONKOTSU Combo- ramen, mini curry, salad, soda = $12\nKING TONKATSU CHALLENGE- 3 Gigantic slabs as big as large oval plate, ramen bowl of rice & miso soup-sized bowl of sauce(asked for aside). Finish all in 20mins = FREE!  Do try a regular-sized plate. It's still of generous sized meat, rice and salad!  \n\nLosers to challenge (like me), pay $30 for lunch and dinner for next 3 days. Though I may not order Tonkatsu for next few weeks, it is still one of best we've ever had. Crunchy, lean, hot, thick slabs of meat, breaded and fried to perfection!  \n\nRamen is delicious on its own, but paired with a mini bowl of another entree you may be curious about + salad + drink for $12!  What a deal!  Cannot  wait til next visit to try other items. \n\nGMonkey want eat entire menu!
