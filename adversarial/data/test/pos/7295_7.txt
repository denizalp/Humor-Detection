Came here to try it out since everyone was telling me I needed to come try! \n\nI ordered 3 items with a friend and a Thai Ice Tea. \n\nMoo Ping - I was not that excited for this to be honest as pork tends to be dry at a lot of places. Oh my god it was so yummy though! Very juicy and full of flavour! I never knew pork skewers could be so tender. 5\/5 \n\nGai Satay - after having the moo ping, I thought the chicken skewer had to be amazing. I was very disappointed however as they were very dry and chewy. The sauce was okay but the chicken really ruined the whole thing. 2\/5\n\nChicken Pad Thai - The Pad Thai was amazing! It was not too dry not too saucy and very flavourful. It is still missing something...not quite sure what. 4\/5\n\nService - waiters were great! The place was very busy but waiters were pleasant nonetheless which is great! The water canters are also so cute! They make cute tweet sounds :) \n\nAll on all, I highly recommend!
