A generous 3 stars for Ari Sushi from some serious sushi fans. The service is perfect and warm and happy. The Udon is also a solid 4 but the sushi is average quality. Good. Just not THE BEST we have ever had. Red snapper was the highlight and best cuts we had. No hard feelings 5 star givers, but this just wasn't in our 5 star range. Cute, sweet and A-Ok!
