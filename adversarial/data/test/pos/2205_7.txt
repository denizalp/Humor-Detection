Turn up!\n\nLobby bar gets pretty packed sometimes given that it's right in front of the Encore hotel room elevators.\n\nGreat place to grab a drink while you're waiting for a table at one of the nearby restaurants or anytime really.\n\nI had a passion fruit something or the other and it was pretty good.\n\nI believe they also are doing light bar food here now. Fairly certain I saw a poster advertising this.\n\nA great option while looking for a quick bar at Encore.
