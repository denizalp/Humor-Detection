Let me preface this by saying that Hawk's has been, for better and worse, my go-to bar throughout college. \n\nThe food is amazing, slightly overpriced but worth it. I usually go with the reuben, but the med-plate is superb if you're in one of those \"keepin it light\/keepin it classy\" moods, not to mention a perfect thing to share with a date. \n\nFull bar. Bartenders are more than ready to make whatever you ask, and proficient at doing it. \n\nExtra Credit tip... if you get a chance, take a glance (that rhymed) at a most excellent array of pictures on the wall facing the long portion of the bar. Your mind will be blown by the eclectically enigmatic selection. \n\nTo conclude, here's a little Mighty Ducks video that I think sums Hawks up in a nutshell....http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jPZ3JX6M7Y4\n\nKeep winning big Hawk's
