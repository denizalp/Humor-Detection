Joe Fresh is to Club Monaco as Old Navy is to Gap. So, for cheap and cheerful fashion, Joe Fresh is designed really well. This branch of Joe has mostly women's clothing and some menswear.\n\nJoe Fresh has recently become my guilty pleasure, my near-weekly indulgence. It's just so affordable - a new blouse is a fraction of my grocery bill from next door's Loblaws. Of course, someone in China is paying the price for my fast fashion...\n\nMy friends are getting a little wary of complimenting my outfits because my responses are becoming quite repetitive:\n\n\"Oh, you love this cute navy dress with the puff sleeves? $24 at Joe Fresh. And this floaty garnet-coloured skirt? $16 at Joe. Where did I find this flattering origami print dress? Joe Fresh, natch, for $23. You've been looking for a simple t-shirt like this one? Try Joe, they're on for $8.\"\n\nStock at Joe Fresh changes very quickly, which puts the pressure on for impulse buying. There's a good chance the item you're wavering on won't be available in a couple of days. Lines for the change rooms here can be long but you are taking a risk on missing out if you vow to return later.
