A pretty cool restaurant if you ask me. It's a diner-y atmosphere but with interesting touches, like two huge fish tanks by the door, filled with even huger fish. Palm trees, and comforting color choices complement the upholstery and the flooring. I had a tasty breakfast sandwich and 30 cups of coffee. Can I just say the bacon was unreal? Really affordable, and a pleasant wait staff. A nice place to roll into after a late afternoon rolling out of bed. Did I mention the bacon?\nAlso, they're open 24\/7.
