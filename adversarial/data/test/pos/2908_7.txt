A Hawaiian patient recommended this place to my boyfriend, so I came in when work brought me on a rare trip to this side of town. Posted menu is a bit difficult to read and understand, and the cashier asked if it was my first time- I said yes, and was handed a paper copy but not given any recommendations or info, which I found odd.\n\nPrices seemed a bit higher than other Hawaiian spots in Vegas and  several dishes were listed as \"market price\" which was a turn off in a fast-casual spot with counter service.  Ordered the 808 combo with teriyaki beef, garlic chicken, spam, rice, and saimin, and added on a spam musubi. The garlic chicken was great, and the musubi was decent, but I wasn't thrilled with anything else- the teri beef in particular was small, thin, and tough to eat. \n\nOrder came out fairly fast, and while I waited I noticed a posted special for poke bowls, which probably would have been a better pick for me. Might give this spot another try if I'm in the area again but this place was lacking the aloha spirit and flavors.
