AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!  My wife and I have spent a few thousand dollars here for \"in-between\" items to mix with our higher end pieces from other, more notable stores.  Its a fun place to go and get ideas, etc. but at the end of the day, you're going to get the same stuff online at overstock.com or wayfair.com\n\nThe last straw was when we ordered a king bed, which was the last one in stock.  We picked it up, sold our old stuff and went to town on the assembly.  We figured out the foot board was the wrong dimension and it wouldn't work.  They needed proof of the problem so we sent photos.  They assured us within 24 hours we'd have feedback, and another bed 24 hours later.  I called after 48 hours only for them to tell me the bed was out of stock nationwide.  So we opted to return it - now we've spent over 9 hours over two afternoons waiting for the delivery driver to come pickup this P.O.S.  The idea of tight delivery time frames was nice, but when they cancel because they're 2 hours late, don't conform to the window or even call, it defeats the purpose.\n\nIn short, Living Spaces can \"suck it, Trebek.\"
