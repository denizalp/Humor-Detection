I'm writing my updated review immediately after picking up an order today because these guys are just that great. Staff is always so pleasant when I come in and when you talk to the owners you can tell they really delight in what they are doing, they care about their customers, and they genuinely want you to have a tasty food experience.\n\nCurrently I'm shoving their mac & cheese special into my mouth between sentences. Seriously this isn't even what I originally ordered but it is soooooooo good! I had called today to get my regular taco meal, but when I got there I just could not resist the temptation of trying their mac & cheese special. I had only wanted to try a tiny sample, but they ended up making me a full order! Getting back to work I was like \"okay, I can have just one bite then I'll put this away for dinner later\". In reality I had one bite and could not stop! After taking a breath and realizing I ate 2\/3 of this and my pants were about to split and I was about to slide under my desk in a delicious food coma, I stopped. I put the fork down, closed the lid, put it back in the bag and shoved it out of sight before the tasty carbs had a chance to completely take over my mind.\n\nSweet baby Jesus I am going to end up on that show, \"My 600lbs Life\". \n\nBut listen, it was good. Real good. \n\nA huge portion with their pulled pork on top. The pasta was gemelli in this creamy coat-your-insides cheese sauce. To me it tasted like there was fresh garlic and chopped fresh tomatoes hidden in this masterpiece. \n\nI'm struggling to keep my eyes open; the food coma is here! \n\nI have to go for a walk around the building so I'll wrap this review up. I 100% support this local restaurant and hope that they continue to succeed! For the lady who gave a 2 star review and said the food was bland, well, I think maybe you're just old and your taste buds have all died off. For the guy who gave 1 star because of the wait, well, it's a popular small restaurant, have some patience or order take-out next time. \n\nOkay, I might need help, someone roll me outside like Violet from Willy Wonka, please.
