Normally I would say that, if you're eating at a place like this, you probably aren't checking Yelp reviews first.  But my wife and I got the coupon in the mail, and were intrigued.  We checked the reviews, they seemed okay.  The pictures looked okay.  \n\nIt was not very good.  The decor was nice enough but the mood in the place was .. subdued.  No one was talking, really, no one was happy to be there.  Not the staff and not the other customers.  It was a bit grim overall.\n\nThe food itself did not inspire happiness.  I don't have high expectations for buffet sushi - you get what you pay for - but this was just weird.  The rice was almost doughy and the fish was cut in weird ways.  It was the strangest sushi I've ever had. Not in a good way.\n\nOkay, well, what about the Chinese buffet staples?  Most of them were there - crab legs, fried chicken in a variety of sauces, egg drop soup.   They were okay but not inspiring.  The sauces all tasted the same and everything had a weird aftertaste.  Some of the fried chicken pieces had little bone fragments in them, which is not very appetizing.  \n\nDid not get the teppan bar.\n\nThe sweet and sour soup was pretty good and - since I had a sour throat at the time - helped with that.  However, the gloomy atmosphere and greasy, heavy food mean that I won't be coming back.
