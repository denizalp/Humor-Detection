I hate to, but I've gotta!\n\nI've ordered from Long Jin for the last year.  Mucho, mucho pungent chicken has been delivered to my door and I'm going to admit, it's good grub.  However, tonight, you guys randomly wanted to charge me a $7.00 delivery fee.  A fee that's never been requested in the 25 times I've had food delivered.  \n\nAlso, the service is awful.  I can't account for the restaurant itself, I'm referencing the rude individual(s) on the phone.  It's like the more please and thank yous I use, the meaner you are.  I don't know why this is, but I'm pretty sure manners are taught all throughout the world and someone needs some schooling.  There was a lot of raising the voice and I would be placed on hold without being told and while in mid-sentence.  I was hung up on several times and when I called back for the third time (I figured it was an accident) I was asked \"Why do you keep calling?\"  What the?  I'm calling to give you business and you clearly don't want it.  Wish granted.\n\nHere's a saying - Learn it.\n\"You catch more bees with honey than vinegar.\"\n\nYou've lost my business.  Never thought I'd be saying this, but, thank goodness for XO Chinese.\n\nSigned,\nBitter Chinese Food Lover
