7 years ago today (9\/15\/04) I was going to purchase a Johnny Ramone signature Mosrite in honor of Johnny's passing, ordered it over the phone thru Ed Roman Guitars using a credit card ,they placed the order and ran my card, I guess later in the day Ed had heard that Johnny Ramone passed away and had his people leave me a message and said\" I needed to call them right away due to a problem\" The only\" problem\" was Ed wanted to double his (my) money and profitise on a dead celebrity, I had a long argument with him on the phone and he reluctantly honored his original price which  he basically had to legally since he already ran my card. He accused ME of being \"sneaky\"  and deceiveing about the purchase, I told him I was a life long Ramones fan and had thought about buying the guitar for over two years, I just thought it would be my tribute to my guitar hero's passing..... I noticed those guitars doubled in price the next day which is sad because they still are  just Japanese Mosrite copies no matter what he sez on his website. The only real true Mosrites were made by or under the supervision of Semie Moseley. I recieved the guitar but noticed I didn't get the included certificate of authenticity and Ramones pick as advertised.........the guy is a real piece of............work.
