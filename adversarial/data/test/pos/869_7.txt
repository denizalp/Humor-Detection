I just visited Ella's a couple weeks ago after not being in for a few years (as I now live abroad). It definitely has cleaned up its act since I was last in.\n\nThe food has always been ok and overpriced, but on this occasion we just got ice cream. GIANT scoops. Yum! (They used to do their own, but these days serve Chocolate Shoppe premium ice cream which is delicious and very high quality). \n\nThe decor is the reason anyone comes back. And it needs a little love, but wasn't as dusty as the last time I visited. \n\nElla's - you seemed shinier in the 80s. I hope you will return to your glory. But I still love you all the same.
