Decent sized Holiday Inn right across the street from a big mall.  \nPlenty of parking as well. The lobby is set up where the rooms are in a circle and can look down into an open lobby. Pool, hot tub, restaurant, coffee shop, pool table are all in the lobby area. \nDecent sized rooms with a fridge as well.
