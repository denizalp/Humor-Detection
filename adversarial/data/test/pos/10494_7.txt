While the name can be No Table sometimes, it's still a wonderful restaurant. I live in the area so I'm here quite a bit and personally have never had table troubles. \n\nThey have a wonderful weekend brunch, and this time of year you are able to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine, or if you want a little A\/C inside is still gorgeously decorated. \n\nI have never had a bad server here, it can be slow at times, but if it's busy I am understanding. Being a celiac always poses challenges and hats off to Notable, as when I tell the server, they ask the cooks what I am able to have and let me know. Which is a very nice touch. \n\nThe food is great, I've never had a bad meal there and I do enjoy the menu gets changed up now and then, so you get to try new things. \n\nThe one downfall is, it's relatively expensive, it's not just a quick in and out dinner. But if you are looking for a nice place to meet friends, for a date or even a family dinner, Notable is definitely on my top 5 list.
