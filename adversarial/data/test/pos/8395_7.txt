I went there a week ago and I got one of the most uneven haircuts in my life, the guy cutting my hair seemed like he was just grabbing hair and cutting randomly which showed in the result as my hair looked worse than it did when I left. I had to go to a different barber the next day to fix it up. I would not go back. It was one of the messiest and worst haircuts I have received.
