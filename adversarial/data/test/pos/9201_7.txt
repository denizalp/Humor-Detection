When we want to blow a little extra $ on sushi, we come here. Their sushi is really fresh. Love the pork belly buns. Excellent place to order omakase if you ain't scurred to elevate your sushi palette above basic CALIFORNIA rolls (scoffs).\n\nAnother note: This place is fine for kids if you go early.\n\nAnother-nother note: If you've only had their sushi buffet, you haven't had the full and real sushi experience. Just like when you only go to a restaurant during restaurant week (scoffs), you get what you pay for. Byeeeee.
