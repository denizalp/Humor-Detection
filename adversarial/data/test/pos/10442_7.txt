This place has some great restaurants. My girlfriend and I joked that we were over here all the time to eat even thought we were staying at another hotel on the strip. Next time we are in Vegas we will stay here for sure and save some trips. I hope the rooms are as good as the restaurants. It would be so nice to just go down stairs for some great food instead of having to drive down the strip.\nIf you are here be sure to check out Burger Bar and The Border Grill. We will be back here for sure.
