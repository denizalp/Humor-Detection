I'm hesitant to write a review on Bianco because no matter what I say, i'm going to sound like a broken record.  I mean, what can i possibly say that hasn't already been said a million times.  Yes, you have to wait a long time to get seated, and just when you think it's your turn, you wait some more.  Yes, the pizza is amazing, especially that crust.  Yes, Chris is a genius working that oven.  I almost want to give this place 3 stars because it's in Phoenix and not in LA.  Why?????????????
