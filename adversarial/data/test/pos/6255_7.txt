I came in about a year ago to shop for my very own first car and I was extremely satisfied with my visit. \n\nOf course with it being my first time buying I was nervous, skeptical, and honestly ready to back out for any reason but Joey S changed all of that! He welcomed me and got straight to the point of what would be the best option for me. Joey took the time to make sure I understood what I was doing and he was honest about what he thinks I shouldn't do also. He in no way rushed me to make a decision, and he even gave extra information about how I could maintain and build my credit! I came back a few days later and left with my beautiful 2013 Pre Owned Civic and I drove away smiling so pleased with how easy Joey made everything. I knew I'd be back next time I needed to. \n\nAnd here we are a year later, and I'm back! I came in with improved credit (thanks to Joeys advice), a better job, and a few questions to go over about trading in or refinancing. I knew it was the right thing to do to come back to Joey because he took care of me once again! First, he sat down with me and listened to everything I had to say and helped me narrow down the options. Ever since the new 2016 Honda Civic came out I've been in love and wishing to drive one and guess who went home with a brand new one that same day? :) Thanks to Joey, I had yet another successful and satisfying car experience. He's the best! \n\nI would also like to acknowledge Oscar from financial. Oscar helped me with my paperwork and he went over everything very detailed. He answered all of my questions perfectly and he clearly knew what he was talking about. The paperwork makes me the most nervous so I appreciate him being so friendly and making it a simple process! \n\nIf anyone's looking to buy\/lease a car I recommend coming here. They will take care of you and make sure you leave happy! \n\n\nThank you so much to everyone at Findlay Honda Henderson for all you do! Especially Joey S. You've earned yourself a life long customer. I'll be back!
