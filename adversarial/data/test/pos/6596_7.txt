I want to go to there every day. Like every day. \n\nThis place blows every other ice cream place out of the water! I'm sorry. I know that's a bold statement. Especially after only sampling a handful of their flavors, but dear lord, are they all amazing! \n\nWith a list of flavors that ALL sound enticing, it was hard to choose just one. I went with the Carrot Cake, which was incredible. I mean, this is legit handmade. Down to the raisins and cinnamon flavors mixed in with creamy ice cream. \n\nI'm going to conquer all the flavors, and then can't wait until they change over again. The absolute only gripe I have is that I wish there was some kind of seating. It's just a stand, and is connected to another business on the other side. So I'm not sure if they're even allowed. But if possible, some benches would be nice! \n\nBut seriously, you could have a shack serving this stuff and I'd be there!
