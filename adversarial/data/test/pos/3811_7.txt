Ever feel like people are dummies for NOT consulting Yelp? I often get into tiffs with my friends about which restaurants NOT to go to. I saw the sparse, lackluster views (especially from Iain B!) and said \"I think this is a bad idea. Are you SURE?\"...damn it, they just had to be.\n\nThis food is just as boring as the neighborhood. It looked well-kept enough, but was uncomfortably quiet. The menu was expansive, but I remained healthily skeptical about what and what not to order. While we waited, we were greeted with water and hot tea...\n\n\"Sun Devil\" chicken\/pork\/beef sounded tasty, but I knew to call bullshit when it said \"extremely spicy\". So I settled for my staple at new Chinese restaurants: Lemon chicken. Why such an overdone dish? Because it tells me if they know how to make a chicken breast, the easiest meat to prepare, and they know how to make a sauce. They failed on both counts.\n\nSure, the chicken was cooked properly, but there was no detectable flavor in the meat itself OR the batter. It was sitting in a pool of a lemon syrup that didn't suit it at all. No hint of fresh lemons anywhere; it tasted like one half of a lemon meringue pie. It was WAY too sweet. My friend's Sun Devil pork came out, and I declined to try it. It was essentially chopped pork with plentiful diced jalapenos. What a snooze. \n\nChang Lee is full of mediocre, uninspiring food that lacks quality, is overpriced, and no sides other than a smidgen of white rice (No wontons? Egg rolls, even!?). I really don't have a reason to return.
