Outdated and busted up seems to be the best way to describe this hot house. A friend and I went browsing around the place and found two items within the whole store worth giving a second glance at. There is a low selection of anything that could be considered modern. I even looked for items that were good in structure, but just needed to be reupholstered and found nothing. I will probably come back to scan around since the selection changes frequently.
