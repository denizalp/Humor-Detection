3 stars for $26 pedicure and cleaniness of the shop. That's were the fun stops\n\nWent in with a sorority sister and couldn't justify sitting and watching her get a pedi to pass the time. So I saw $26 and thought ok. Checked for tools and cleanliness and felt ok~ I'll give them a shot. \n\nWhy she goes here? I forgot but she won't again. So she says!\n\nThe good:\n1) They were busy so we soaked for some time as requested\n2) They have wi-fi. They pay the Library to teether and it works well\n3)THEY HAVE LITTLE KID MASSAGE CHAIRS & ALL. SOOOOO CUTE.IT'S ADORABLE.  \n4) THAI APPEARED TO BE KNOWLEDABLE AND HE'S A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER. \n5) NICE COLOR SELECTION. UP TO DATE ON NEW TECHNIQUES\n6) APPARENTLY THEY WAX AND EVERYTHING ELSE. \n\nWhat could improve: \n1) Upfront pricing. I had on my Shellac Pedicure from VDazzle and he charged an extra $5 for removal. Really? He didn't tell me this when he started solely when we finished. \n1b- To remove the polish all he did was use the tool (name aludes me now) and a bunch of acetone. I don't think this is healthy for my nail bed but whatever.\n2) No pedi parafin like ENVY Nails. The more I write the more I'm reliving my experience and thinking a 2 star should be here but I'll proceed. \n3) The mani turned to Shellac so of course the price goes up and I ask how much...\n4) Agree to the shellac mani but how about this. More drilling then soaking in ACETONE to get rid of the Shellac. Now this is my 1st Shellac removal. Maybe everyone is doing this. If they are - I'm no longer getting shellac. I normally only wear clear on my nails because I don't like when the polish doesn't last but Shellac appeared to be the remedy. \n\n5) I got a clear Shellac. Sounds nice in theory & it is glossy BUT it just won't work for me. The obvious issue: dirty nails under the tips on my bed. So I'm always pickingto  make sure they are clean. \n6) He cut down my nails without asking. He tried this during the pedi but I caught him. This time I didn't. So my right hand is shorter. I prefer to be asked what length do you want. My nails are long & I prefer them to be that way. I don't care about wearing my nails short but people pay for length - WHY WOULD YOU THINK I WANT THEM SHORT WHEN WOMEN DO PAY FOR LONG FAKE NAILS?? \nWhen I asked, he said - because one was shorter so he was making them all the same length. I'm like - nope! that one will just have to be short. These are my human nails I could care less about an even appearance. Anywhoo, I'm not upset about it that I'd argue or something...this is simply my typing or touchscreen hand now. \n\nMoving on. What should have been a $38 experience based on the posted price ($26 Spa Pedi or $38 Spa Pedi\/Mani) turned into a $56 ordeal before tip. WTh!\n\nHere's the itemization:\n$26 spa pedi\n$5 pedi removal\nthe remainder for your mani. \nI asked well aren't you going to cut my cuticles around my fingernail bed? He said that will be extra. THAT COMMENT WILL NOW MAKE THIS A 2 STAR REVIEW. \n\nAny guy off the street nows a manicure is a manicure. That entails clipping away old skin around the nail bed and pushing back the cuticle. Yeah~ 2 stars is all that is needed. \nNo 2.5, especially not a 3. I'll update this if my regular place does the same because maybe this is the industry standard and I'm simply unlearned in this matter.
