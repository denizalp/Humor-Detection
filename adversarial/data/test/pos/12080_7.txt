I've been practicing at 103 for more than a year and let me start off by saying this place is the real deal.  Whether you're looking to get twisted into a knot in a yoga class or beaten into submission at boot camp, this place has it all.  Contrary to its name - 103 Hot Yoga - the studio offers both heated and non-heated classes.  There are a variety of classes catering to all different levels of practitioners - first timers all the way to advanced.  Classes can have folks in their early twenties to mid eighties - yes - mid eighties!  This place is for everyone.  \n\nThe studio itself is very well done with a bit of a higher end feel. There are two spacious rooms for classes, one with a boot camp and Pilates focus and the other that is primarily yoga focused.  There are plenty of mirrors in both which ensures you can check out either your flawless form or see what your pre-pass-out face looks like.  The studio also has spacious locker rooms and showers - which is a nice plus that not all studios in town offer.  To add to the experience, there is free towel service, soaps, conditioners, and there's even a bowl of sea salt used to scrub your hands.  Instead of going home smelling like sweaty socks, you will be fresh and ready to go.  \n\nThe best part of 103 are the instructors.   The instructors will guide you through your yoga practice with experience and thoughtfulness that is typically only seen in experienced instructors with strong understandings of yoga asana practice and yogic principles.  While all of the instructors are phenomenal, if you can only try one class\/instructor, you won't want to miss Greg Go who is really a master.  Josie and Tisha are also top notch standouts that you should try if you get a chance.  \n\nPut down your phone and head over to 103 - you won't be disappointed.
