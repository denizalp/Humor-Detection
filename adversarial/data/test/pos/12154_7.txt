\"The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls\" - Pablo Picasso\n\nFood has a strong connection to art. Similar to how an artist cannot truly appreciate the extent of Mona Lisa's smile until he is standing in front of the canvas in the Louvre; one cannot appreciate the extent of the artistic value of this restaurant unless one has tasted their gnocchi. \n\nWhether it'd be from your failed aspirations, disappointing child, or short comings... food from this restaurant will definitely wash away the dust off your soul.\n\nTheir food is satisfying to the tongue. Sauces on their pasta are fresh and bold, with just the right amount of garlic and butter. Their gnocchi will literally melt in your mouth. Their cured meat collections are forged from nectar of the gods. Service is sublime and prompt. Their breads are soft and fluffy, you could probably use a loaf as a pillow.\n\nThe rustic environment that this restaurant provides allows a sense of romance and comfort. You could potentially bring your Tinder date here, but only if you are willing to spend minimum of $150 for dinner (mains only) for two. Perhaps its easier to subscribe to Netflix instead.
