BOTTOM LINE: Go to Sansotei for better ramen. Go to Banh Mi Boys for cheaper pork buns. Go upstairs to Daisho and pay a little bit more for a better experience. Basically, go anywhere else for anything else for better quality and value. Also, no place for your coats! #DesignFail.\n\nUm, a bowl of ramen + an order of pork buns + a beer will cost your $35 before tax and tip. WTF?! Is this stuff made from unicorn sweat?!  Price alone drops this rating to 1-star - there's just too much competition around to justify anything higher.\n\nFor what amounts to Japanese fast food, people can't seem to pay enough. If McCafes charged this amount for their combos, people would revolt! At least McCafes are more spacious, allows you to hang your coat and brews a solid cup of joes.\n\nTo their credit, the PORK BUNS has been faithfully translated from their Saam Bar. They, unfortunately, also translated the same pricing policy to their SHITAKE BUNS, which were a bit too salty. The MOMOFUKU \"RAMEN\", however, tasted more like buckwheat noodles and the choice of adding kimchi creates a jarring sour taste to the salty (and forgettable) broth. The pork was nicely portioned and the egg was done alright. Service was pretty good. I've heard their chilled ramen is the highlight, but honestly, it's gonna be a while before I'm back.\n\n*As an aside, wassup with the ramen craze in Toronto?! Hello? It's a friggin' bowl of noodle soup. Every Asian culture has a version of this and there's certainly no shortage of excellent Pho and Chinese (BBQ braised beef anyone?) in town, but you don't see peeps paying $16 for one of those!
