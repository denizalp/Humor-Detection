I am a fan. There hasn't ever been a time when I have had company come in town to visit and I didn't take them to this place.\n\nSeriously, you cannot go wrong with the burgers, wings, fries and onion rings in this place.\n\nThe burgers are all made to order and you simply check on your Menu Sheet what you want on your burger and how you want it cooked. Same goes with the wings, how many wings, what flavors, what sides, etc. \n\nIt's the best cheap eats around. Seriously. \n\nSometimes the service can be a little slow especially when the bar next door is extremely busy so do not come here in a rush. Lay back and enjoy the moment and cheap food you are about to experience. If you take your burger to go, please note that they charge you a dollar extra.
