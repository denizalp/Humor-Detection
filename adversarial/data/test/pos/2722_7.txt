Paid $90 for a luxury spa pedicure and manicure. My feet look great but the gel polish on my nails is chipping, my nails are all torn, and the guy cut me twice when he trimmed my cuticles. \n\nThe pedicure was great and very thorough, but for that price it just wasn't worth it. I've had 15 dollar manicures that looked great for weeks. Not happy.
