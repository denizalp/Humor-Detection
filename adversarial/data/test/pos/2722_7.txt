$15\/lb shrimp\n$14\/lb crawfish\n$11 calamari \n$0.75\/corn\n\nThey weren't so busy the night of cinco de mayo so we decided to stop by. I was craving calamari and boy did that hit the spot. They have marinara sauce (thank goodness). I got a half pound of shrimp, lemon pepper, baby spice with a corn added and a side of rice. My boyfriend got a pound of crawfish, hot n juicy, medium with two corns on the side, one plain and one in the sauce. \n\nTheir service was great and they always checked up on us. They gave you a bib and gloves once you sit down. They had specials that night, $2 coronas and $5 margaritas which were definitely worth it! I like the location since it's on the strip and open late.  If ever you're near Planet Hollywood and looking for that shrimp or crawfish fix, hot n juicy is the way to go!\n\nThey allow outside drinks. *two thumbs up*
