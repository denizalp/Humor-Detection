I went shopping at Staples today for my store business supplies. I was appalled by the service I received from the associates in the front including the manager, Katie. \n\nI had made purchases and awaited assistance from the \"manager\" in regards to a defected item. While I waited an associate approached me. I told her I was awaiting a managers assistance. I then told her the item I wanted to purchase was defected. Instead of checking another store for the item. She told me 10% off. Then I told her I would wait for the manager. She SLAMMED the item on the counter and said the manager will tell me the same. At this point I could not believe the hostility towards a customer. I waited for the manager, Katie. I told Katie about my experience with the associate. Katie then told me okay, without apologizing for the experience I just encountered. I then proceeded to locate a corporate number. Katie then approached me with the stores number. I cannot tolerate this service. \n\nThe employees here definitely do not want to be there. They should have the proper training. \n\nI could not believe that the manager's actions were just like the associate. Extremely rude. \n\nI refuse to shop at this Staples for my business supplies. I may get better service at a competitors store. I really just want upper management to know the things that are occurring in this location. \n\nKatie the \"manager\" - Very unprofessional, unpolished, appeared that she hasn't showered in a few days.
