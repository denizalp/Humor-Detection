I absolutely love Grand Lux Cafe!  I normally don't have time to eat at the Cafe and end up getting food from the bakery ( the bakery food is just a good)but obviously not as great at the-sit-down version.  Came here for lunch and I got the pasta and the salad combo.  The pasta itself was huge!  it was suppose to be \" lunch portion\" but in my opinion it was the normal dinner size.  I got the telefono pasta. YUM.  The boyfriend got the steak sandwich and it was perfect!!!  Prices were extremely cost efficient considering were in vegas, this lunch was cheap, good and fer-filling.  I packed most of my pasta to-go and ate it as a midnight snack! 5 stars in my books!
