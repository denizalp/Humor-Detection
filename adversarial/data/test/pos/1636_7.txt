On my way back from dropping my Daughter off in Ann Arbor, I decided to make my solo return home s bit of a foodie side trip.  I diverted from my planned return route to experience the Primanti Bros. sandwiches.  Thanks to GPS I was able to find this fabled restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District.  After parking my car for $6 I headed towards Primanti Bros.  There was a long line but thankfully two large parties ahead of me.  Since I was solo I got in quickly and was seated at the bar.  TV's everywhere showing college football.  Very lively bar scene.  I perished the menu and decided on the pastrami sandwich which comes with tomato, coleslaw, and French fries.  I was so excited to be there that I\nmistakenly ordered more fries.  The sandwich served on white bread arrived after the fries which were outstanding.  I bit into the sandwich and I was in love.  I normally hate coleslaw as it is creamy but this vinegary slaw was the perfect complement to the pastrami and fries.  Every bite was wonderful.  The layers of flavor in this sandwich were singing to me.  I wish I could have brought them home.  I devoured it and then settled up to\nMake room for more patrons.  Picked up a T-shirt on the way out.  So if you are in Pittsburgh this is a must visit.  Well worth the detour!
