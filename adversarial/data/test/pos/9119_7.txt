Ok, so this is not a trauma one facility. Good for bone breaks, minor emergencies or scheduled surgeries. \nVERY clean. I have worked in numerous hospitals, and this facility is by far one of the cleanest that I have been in.\nTHIS IS A \"FOR PROFIT\" facility. Yes, people need to make money these days. Unfortunately sometimes budgets are not a big at the county hospitals, but sometimes you have to weigh your options.\nI had an ER visit a few years ago, and waited no more than 5 minutes to get in to see a doctor. Seriously. \nDoctor's affiliated with this hospital are generally great, from my experiences.  \nParking is easy, check, checking in and out is easy, check, wait time is quick, check, very clean, check.\nSo I am only giving it four stars because it is not a trauma one facility. That my friends you have to travel to Charlotte...CMC. And if you are going there, chances are it will be by helicopter.
