I recently ordered a take out order from Dom DeMarco's from Amazon restaurants since I had a $5 coupon to use. Every time I go to the PetSmart next door I can smell the deliciousness so I thought why not give it a try. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up sharing the Calamari and Mushroom & White Truffle pizza (without the arugula). I thought the calamari was great. It was a little bit soggy, but I blame the delivery person on that. I really liked the marinara sauce that came with it. (4\/5) The pizza I thought was tasty, but wish I would have got something with classic red sauce instead. It ended up being a little too dry for me. (2\/5)\n\nI would love to give this place another try, but I think next time I'll just stop being lazy and dine in.
