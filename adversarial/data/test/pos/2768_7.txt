Visited my daughter in Bullhead city, but love to golf so stopped by for a quick bite. Am a fan of kitchen nightmares but know it's a TV show and can be full of drama.\nThis place is beautifully decorated. And it was busy for a small eatery...the food was okay. They are trying improvements I can tell, but they are trying too hard! Just saying, relax and have fun with it. I got the impression they were too focused on proving Ramsay wrong than just enjoying their customers and their business.
