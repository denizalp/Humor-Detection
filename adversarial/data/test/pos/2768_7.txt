Stopped by for breakfast.  Soft opening, so limited menu and hours at this time.  Staff was very friendly and able to answer a couple of questions about the menu.  \nNot a large space with 4 booths, a couple 4 tops and a few 2 tops that they can put together, and about 8 seats at the counter a a few in the window.  \nWas told they will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner once they have their legs under them and the soft opening is complete.  The bakery has some interesting items and will be sure to stop back and grab a few items.  \nWill the food is rather basic it is flavorful and fairly priced.  My corned beef tongue hash with fresh salt rising bread, eggs and mujadara was very good.
