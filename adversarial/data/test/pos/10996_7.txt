12\/13\/12\n\nNice space!  Let me rephrase that-- very cool-looking bar counter, but the rest of the room was too open, with low four-tops in the middle of the main room and high two- to four-tops next to bare walls and near the bar area.  It felt a little disconcerting...  Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately gravitated to the bar counter, where the choicest seats seemed to be.  The bartender there was friendly and eager to tell me all about the beers offered here.  After being able to sample one of the beers (sorry, none of the ones listed online sounded familiar), I decided to go with a glass of Malm Sonoma pinot noir ($10).  A pet peeve of mine is having to drink wine from a beer glass- not cool, but I got over it.\n\nI started off with the Braised Pork Belly, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g#IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g which came charred (grr!) and sitting on top of a delightful silky bed of (not cloyingly) sweet yam puree, and garnished with Brussels sprouts slaw and maple syrup.  I expected the pork belly to have a little more crunch after seeing all that char, but it was almost too tender.  It tasted quite lovely, but I preferred the pork belly that Roka Akor used to serve (I hear it's not on the menu, anymore?).  I really enjoyed the yam puree's contribution to the dish-- it was almost jammy.  Still, at $10, I'm going to skip it next time (and resolve to look for it on my next trip to Roka Akor!).\n\nFor my main, I had the Braised Duck Leg, $13, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ#aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ which was a work of art!  Gorgeous colors and a MYRIAD of textures and flavors, it is definitely a dish I would order again and again!  The duck was crispy and very delicious- one of the best pieces of duck I've ever had the pleasure of tasting!  I especially enjoyed the crispy mung bean cake upon which the leg was placed on.  (Being Asian, I am familiar with mung beans- red, yellow, and green, to name a few, so to see this ingredient used in a novel way in American cuisine was exciting!)  I so loved the big bursts of ginger flavor in the cake-- I wish to see this item on more menus- at least as a substitute for crispy polenta, or risotto.  The sweet soy had almost a balsamic twist to it.  I whole-heartedly recommend this dish!\n\nTo finish, I ordered the Apple Turnover, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A#4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A with vanilla-bean ice cream, $6- a special of that day, which required I wait an extra twenty minutes to bake-- I do not mind waiting for freshly-baked pastries!  This delightfully-flaky turnover arrived atop a rivulet of beautiful caramel sauce, piping-hot tender spiced apple slices inside, a dollop of creme fraiche, and apple matchsticks on top.  All of this was garnished with toasted pine nuts... Exquisite, and yes, I ate it all!  \n\nSince I arrived during happy hour, I was able to get a $1 off each item.  I found the tab a bit pricey ($46, including an $8 tip), but I did have wonderful leftovers for lunch at work the next day-- everyone kept eyeing what I was eating and asked where I found it on the buffet spread!  As if!  :)\n\nI'll absolutely be back!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA#AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA
