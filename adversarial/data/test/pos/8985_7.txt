This was a decent bar down in the lobby of the Rio Hotel\/Casino.  You could belly up at the bar, sip on some great cocktails, and pay 25 cent games.   I am not a gambler, but went here with  a friend while staying in the Hotel.  She won a whole dollar after playing for like 2 hours.  Really not worth the 50 cent profit an hour.  Good thing they had booze.\nThe smoke smell wasn't as strong here as most of the areas in the casino.  The bartenders here were extremely nice and chatty (unlike most of the staff at the hotel).  \nI stopped in here a couple times during my stay and enjoyed sipping on Scotch and chatting with fellow drinkers.  \nThis place was usually not as crowded as the rest of the casino.
