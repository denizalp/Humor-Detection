Wow .  So way over priced....again way overpriced.   I live in Manhattan and Italian restaurants don't come close to this.  The server admitted to it being over priced because the quality of the food.  That's B.S..  It's over priced gouging.   There are more affordable places.  Plus the staff is nasty, aloof and could care less if you aren't a local BLAH.  Owner should be ashamed
