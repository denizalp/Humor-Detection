A ton of sushi burrito spots have popped up over the last year or so, but California Sushi Burrito is one of the few doing things right! I'm usually a poke bowl person but CSB's burritos are stuffed with so much fresh fish that it's hard to resist going hand-held. The SeaWorld is my fave, with a great sauce that is light without being overpowering, while the Blue Ocean comes in a close second. Next, I'll probably try the Palm Springs. For their grand opening special, dine-in orders come with sweet potato chips and a miso soup- no soup for you if you take your order to go.
