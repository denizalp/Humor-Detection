I really love Taco El Gordo at the other locations and now they opened one up closer to my home and I was pretty ecstatic. It took me a while to come visit this location, though, I'm not quite sure why.\n\nI think the only thing I have an issue with is the set up of the place. I know they are pretty known for it and not that many people really care about the setup but I just hate going into one line for carne asada and then having to go into another line for the spicy pork.\n\nBut boy do I love the spicy pork tacos with everything especially that guac on top. I always ask for extra. BOMB. and then you can ask for chili and onions on the side, oh so good and spicy! I also get the carne asada fries half not full because the half is like already big enough anyway. I love how it just taste so authentic. The staff could be a little nicer but they aren't necessarily mean but could smile a bit more.\n\nI also LOVE that their fountain drinks consist of Mexican drinks like Horchata or that Pina juice. BOMB. and its free refills! \n\nQuick tip, if you need green or red salsa ask the cashier. It took me a while to figure out where i can get salsa from because usually they just have it out and it's a serve yourself type of thing but not here. It is kinda good though because then the salsa doesn't get infested with random things if its just out there in the open.\n\nlove this place. will be back for sure.
