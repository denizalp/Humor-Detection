You're much better off just paying like $20 extra for an alignment and going to a dealership or other professional place where they have a real alignment rack than this hole in the wall. They just seemed clueless about my car.\n\nRude people that talk down to you, understaffed, junky room to wait in, and take far longer than they promise.  The price is just not that much of a discount, I'd gladly pay a tiny bit more.\n\nThey also just seemed out of their element, like they were feeling their way through the job.
