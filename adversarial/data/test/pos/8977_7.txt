THE WORST SERVICE DEPARTMENT EVER!!!  If I could give this Phoenix Motors '0' stars or negative stars, believe me, I would!  Took my car in for an A\/C switch problem and came away with engine damage. My A\/C was not coming on immediately when I pushed the button so I took it in to have it looked at.  At the end of the day, my service adviser said they found a loose wire that was causing the problem and fixed... for $380.00 (seriously!). Then he proceeded to tell me that after performing a thorough inspection of my car, there was a host of \"other\" things wrong with it that needed immediate repair. (There was nothing else wrong with my S600) when I took it in) and if I would authorize $10,000 worth of repair work, they would get to it right away. I told him to have my keys ready and I'd be down to pick it up.  \n\nWhen I did pick it up, The under panel of my dashboard was still unattached and sitting on the front passenger seat,  There were empty water bottles of the service men littering my back seat.  Very irritated, I complained and they sent a man with tools out to the driveway to fix the under panel. Didn't even bother to pull it back into a bay.  Wish I had looked in my car before I paid.  When I started my car, it didn't sound right. It was idling high and went into gear hard.  Mentioned this to Robert Wolf (service adviser) and he dismissed it saying it will drive out.  I left and didn't make 2 miles before my car went into convulsions; spuddering, shuddering and kicking out smoke.  Then it died in the middle of Indian School Rd.  Once it did restart, I limped it into a parking lot and called my service adviser Robert Wolf.  He feigned ignorance but sent someone to pick me up.  They then had my car towed back to PMC.  \n\nI will say that they gave me a loner car, but they proceeded to KEEP MY CAR FOR 20 DAYS while they attempted to repair whatever it was that they did. And in the end, they fixed nothing and took NO RESPONSIBILITY.  Of course... they told me everything that was wrong with my car was my own fault and that they did everything they could to correct what happened.  Except that when I took my car in, only for an A\/C switch mind you, they proceeded to monkey around with my car, checking this and that, with NO AUTHORIZATION from me to do so, so they could discover every way possible to milk more and more money from me.  They claimed to have done all of this work while my car was in , and gave me a staggering list of things.  They said what I needed essentially were valve seal covers and charged me $555.00 for them, tried to charge me for more but I refused.  I had to scream and yell to get Robert Wolf to listen, and he said they repaired or replaced everything else that may have caused the issues before.  No apologies.  But more empty water bottles in my trunk and a missing gas cap.  These guys truly SUCK!  \n\nWhen I left after picking up my car for the second time, this time I made it to the 51 fwy when the problems started again.  I called my credit card company 1st to do a charge back and AAA second.  Had my car taken to another service center.\n\n THESE GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF CROOKS!!!  I own 3 Mercedes Benz cars and will NEVER trust the repair of any one of them to Phoenix Motor Company ever again.  And I caution anyone reading this review of the same.\n\nI called and sent numerous emails to owner Chuck Theisen and general manager Al LeMoine, all with NO response.  Poor, very poor.  Never even received a courtesy call from an assistant to say they were looking into it.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  I was shocked and appalled at the way they ran their business.\n\nSo I encourage any other PMC customer who has had a similar experience to voice their displeasure here, and everywhere, so others may be forewarned and maybe PMC will take note of just how truly AWFUL their service department is.
