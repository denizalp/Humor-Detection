How have I not reviewed my favorite Madison Mexican joint?\n\nThis place is sooo good.  Free salsa and chips? Check. A nice assortment of Mexican Brews? Check.  Fresh Tamales? Check. The only thing they are missing is Margaritas. \n\nI swear you could order your food and have it served in the time its takes Univision to do a commercial break.  They are that fast.  \n\nI had never had a huarache before coming here.  Now the Huarache Mexicano is my go to.  My gf loves the burritos.  Their tacos al pastor are a lesson in simple awesomeness.  \n\nI actually came here up talk up their chicken chimichanga.  I was hungover and wanted some comfort food that only The Taqueria could offer.  I had heard the chimis were awesome but I never got around to trying the deep fried goodness.  Oh My God was it great.  It was cheesy fried awesome.   I don't want to know how many calories are in a deep fried chicken burrito.  The worst part about my last visit is now I know I like deep fried chicken burritos.  I didn't need to know that.  I was perfectly fine with regular burritos. Oh Well.
