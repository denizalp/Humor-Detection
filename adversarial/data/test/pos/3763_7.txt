I've always wanted to try their birthday cake, so when I saw they had a birthday cake shake, I saw my opportunity to try it without spending $50+ on a small cake.\n\n$10 on a 12 oz shake that I think they used pre-packaged birthday cake truffles (do they even make the truffles fresh in house?!).  It was okay.  I got a flour-y taste, which was kind of weird\/unexpected.  For $10?  Can't say this was totally worth it...
