Is it touristy as hell? Yes!\n\nIs it a must do while visiting the city? Heck Yes!!\n\nI don't care how long you're in town for you have to make sure to check this off your list of sites to see. Situated adjacent to Ripley's Aquarium you can grab a ticket for around $40 CAD and can then add on to go up the \"space needle\".\n\nKeep in mind there is a security checkpoint before your go in and there's two lines to utilize. From that point you purchase your tickets and walk past the souvenir store (you'll be directed there when you take the elevator back down) and can take a green screen photo.\n\nThe next check point you hit is the line to go up the main elevators that'll take you to the sky deck. It was currently under construction (just a section of it) but those newly installed floor-to-roof windows are LIFE!\n\nThe views are amazing and you definitely want to make sure you have storage space on your camera or phone.\n\nFrom above you can even see New York on a clear day but make sure to take your time and bask in all the views the CN Tower offers.\n\nFor those of y'all who might get hangry... there's a snack kiosk up there.\n\nYou can actually go outside on their roof deck and walk around but keep in mind those winds are no joke!\n\nI'm so happy i was able to experience this!!
