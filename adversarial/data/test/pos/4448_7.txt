I hope to god that potential buyers and lesees go to Yelp to read the reviews of this so called team - The Daumke Team.  I dealt with Brian Daumke.\n\nNot only is he completely unresponsive but (I really do hate to say it) he's a liar.  The lease he sent me to sign was obnoxious and (I believe) illegal!  Yes, you heard me correctly, illegal.  \n\nI have been renting for 35 years in AZ and around the country and this was the ugliest, most oppressive lease term agreement I have ever seen.  I even had a family member (who is a realtor who has written over 500 leases herself) look at it and she said it was \"disgusting, unprofessional and illegal.\"  \n\nThey won't pay for practically anything and they strip you of your tenant rights. \n\nPlease PLEASE, read your lease carefully if you are seeking to lease a home from them.  Especially, the Addendum.  It is flat out nasty.   They pay for practically nothing.  (He wouldn't even - at my request - fix a completely rusted and frozen in place master bath sink ring and stopper!  And, this was for a large beautiful home with vaulted ceilings in Ahwatukee.  Beautiful I say but when you look inside, you can see how everything is in desperate need of updating and replacing.  Clearly neglected.)\n\nOn top of that, he doesn't return you emails, phone calls, texts anything.  And Brian and the incompetent Daumke team are not only the realtors but the property managers so let me ask you... how responsive do you think he'll be if you have a problem or emergency.  \n\nForget about it.  HE DOESNT CARE.  \n\nThese people should have their license revoked.  \n\nJust run. RUN FAST!  Bad people.
