Went there with my husband last night to celebrate our 15th anniversary.  Had been once or twice and sat at bar.  Had good experiences and enjoyed the variety of vegetarian options.  Food was good last night, but our waitress needed some serious help.\nThe ordering went well enough, but while we were eating our delicious pasties the waitress started bussing the table behind us.  She knocked over what I think was a pretty good amount of red wine in a glass on the table and then left quickly. My husband's back was to the table and he had felt a splash on his arm. I went and looked behind his chair, saw the spill, and saw a huge splatter of wine across the back of his creme colored shirt.  Wine was also a platter ed on the floor.  \nThe best I could tell is that our waitress either had very dull eyesight or was hoping we wouldn't notice.  Another employee walked by and saw what happened and I told her it was our waitress.  Waitress came back about 5 minutes later and offered to \"blot\" the wine out w\/water......really..like that would work.  She then asked us if we wanted anything else, dessert, if my husband wanted another beer.  She ended up taking off $14.  Said she bought us a round, but $14 didn't even cover our 2 beers much less the cost of my husband's ruined shirt.  \nPretty much ruined our anniversary dinner and she didn't give a true apology.  After reading other reviews it seems like service is an issue at this location.  If we ever go back, I would most likely sit at the bar or counter to hopefully avoid inconsiderate waitresses spilling food or drink.
