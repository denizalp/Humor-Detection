Getting in is challenging. Especially if you have meat and two veg. The place was mobbed when we went on industrial night. Lots of strange characters...\n\nThe waterfall truly is an amazing site to behold - especially after sinking 1\/2 bottle of JD. Tryst was fun but in my opinion not a patch on XS across the esplanade of the Wynn\/Encore towers.\n\nDrinks are typically overpriced. Expect to pay up to $30 per drink including tip. Get mashed up before you head here if you want to save some cash. Music was good and the bouncers kept everyone in order without being too oppressive.\n\nProps to the blonde Spearmint Rhino stripper who offered herself up on a plate to us for a mere $500 per hour. Wow.
