So the Carriage House has two things going for it, convenience and low cost. Convenience in that it is a short walk to the casinos you wish you had stayed at, and low cost in a man my cheapness is starting to make me feel dirty sorta way.\n\nThe down sides: the beds were uncomfortable, the other hotel guests on average seemed depressed, there were a few smiling characters but most looked like they were on their way to a funeral, and there was no deadbolt on the door to my room.\n\nThe upsides: I could poach free WiFi from the MGM Grand and use it to search Yelp for places to escape to, I didn't need to walk far to get somewhere more uplifting, and they had tolerable free coffee in the lobby in the morning.
