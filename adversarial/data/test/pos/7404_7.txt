Unless you are staying there, and can get in line half an hour before the pool opens, don't bother. We were there half an hour after it opened on Saturday morning, paid $60 for the two of us, and could find nowhere to sit; not even the side of the pool.\n\nStupid me thought since they were open to the public there would be lockers. The best suggestion was to leave our bag at the hotel desk. The pool is tiny, the slide is short, and the number of chairs inadequate. We were there half an hour and gave up. I console myself by imagining the money will go toward the health and safety of the fish.
