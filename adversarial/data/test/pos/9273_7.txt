Don't bother\n\nNC-17 \n\nIf you're into surprises like some people are into surprise butseks or equivalents thereof, make sure you visit this location. Wanted lactose free? Well you may get whole milk, 20% cream or even cheese nut spread. Who the f**k knows! It's all in the cards for you weary traveller! \n\nYou came here thinking to yourself, \"You know, I've had a long f**king day, maybe I need to pamper myself with one of those exorbitantly expensive drinks, so what the hey, I'll go to Starbucks!\" -- You're in for a treat! Not only will they f**k it up for you, they will f**k it up in random and novel ways! Ways your puny brain could not have even begun to contemplate! \n\nYou wanted no sugar added because you go into a coma if you have a tablespoon? Well no matter, the b*tch at the bar will give you two random helpings of syrup! enough to ruin your f**king break, and the rest of your day, but not quite enough to get you to North York General!\n\nTo spice things up there are always a few homeless guys hanging around ogling at the chriping high school crowds. This place is just a f**king delight to visit. You do need to have damaged long term memory like me because after six months or so, I forget how horrified I was the last time around, and I'm right back in there ordering my super expensive drink which they're about to bu77 f**k up the arse, yet once again.\n\nAnd this location gets their staff right from the corporate headquarters! Aren't you glad you're getting the best service this esteemed establishment has to offer? \n\nEnjoy!
