I hate giving unfortunate reviews but I feel this one is more a warning as my experience might be a Your Mileage May Vary.  Im not sure what happened or if it was just an off day but the service here seemed genuinely irritated and frustrated at something.\n\nThis is a quick service take out spot.  Though there is some standing room to eat your meal, the rough service makes this spot really unwelcoming and uncomfortable.  I could not wait to get my food and just head back to my car to eat instead.  Like most spots out in W Queen St W, it's a narrow older spot that has a lot of character.  It's clean and functional ... nothing really to be knocking it.\n\nAbout the service, I should have taken the death stare upon opening the door as my first hint that I should have turned around.  The tone and physical stance were really more confrontational and it most of the room look at each other with hesitation.  He definitely did not care for anything and the throwing around of bowls, utensils, and everything was a bit alarming.  \n\nAs for the salad, the vinaigrette nearly made the salad inedible.  It was overly salty and acidic... and I didnt put on very much onto it either.  The vegetable offering is ok.  Cauliflower was super limp and rubbery but all other vegetables seem at least fresh.  3\/5\n\nI dont think I'll be returning.  Not sure what happened but from a service and food, there's better and more relaxing options nearby.
