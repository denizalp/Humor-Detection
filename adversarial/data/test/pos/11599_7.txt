If you've been to Frankie's Tiki bar and like it, you'll love this place. \n\nIt's bigger, better and have better drinks! \n\nThe best drink is \"Banana Batida\" it has Dole pineapple Whip in it! If you've been to Disneyland you're familiar with dole whip. It's is literally heaven! It taste like a Pi√±a colada. They also have another drink with Dole whip in it but the Banana Batida is the best one. \n\nOnly thing I don't like about this place is that it's a smoking bar. And yes I know that's normal but I just hate it. \n\nLove this place!
