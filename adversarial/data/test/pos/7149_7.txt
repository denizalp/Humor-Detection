Went in with realistically low expectations, and they were met!  Yay Britney!\n\nI'm a big fan of her music, but had never seen her live.  If you've seen any of her award show performances of the last 7 years or so, you know what to expect.  She doesn't do much.  She walks back and forth across the stage.  Flails her arms a bit.  Might have been moving her mouth a little, I couldn't see from the cheap seats.  Says \"WHAT'S UP VEGAS??!?\" once or twice, which made me thankful she's in the same city every night or even that might've be too difficult for her at this point.\n\nBut with all that said, I had a great time!  I got to sing and dance along to Britney's greatest hits while Britney herself was in the room with me!  The only thing that didn't meet my expectations was the crowd - I seemed to be seated in the AARP section with a bunch of seniors who clearly made a wrong turn on their way to Celine Dion.  The people around me didn't (couldn't?) get out of their seats even once, which was a bit of a buzzkill.  \n\nOn the plus side, the dancers around Britney were excellent and some of the set pieces were pretty cool.  All in all it was a fun show, but could have used a little more effort on Britney's part to get the audience engaged.
