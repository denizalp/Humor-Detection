***PLEASE READ***, this is a fraud alert from this company. I rented a property from these people for 1 year. Here is my experience. The initial renting procedure was pleasant and accommodating. When I arrived on the property I wrote down everything that was wrong with the place on their initial walk through sheet and mailed it to them. We noticed that the shower needs to be re-caulked and have mold removed. I called Prudential and they sent someone out to clean the mold out, and repair the caulking. The mold grew back and I called them again. They sent another person out to remove the mold, but stated that where we see the mold is only on the surface and that it is growing underneath the shower. Called Prudential about this and they ignored the issue. So we let it go for the time being because we had another full bathroom if we needed to shower. Then our AC unit goes out and it takes Prudential over 21 days to fix it, this is all happening in the month of July in 105 degree weather so my wife and I had to stay at my parents house. We were not sure if we had to move out of our house after it being unlivable for over 3 weeks so we withheld our rent as any reasonable person would do and told them from the beginning and they agreed. After they fix the A\/C unit, instead of discounting the rent even for a couple days worth of a discount. they lied and said they never agreed to us not paying them until they get it fixed and hit me with $541.45 worth of fines, fees and also a court date to have me evicted. I agreed to pay it verses my better judgment. After my lease agreement ended and I moved out I believe I was going to get a good sum of my deposit back. I should have known that they were going to screw me on that too. In my initial walk through report, we stated on paper, that the shower had mold and needed to be re caulked, even though Prudential did the repair themselves because it was an existing issue, they still took the money ($80) out of my Security Deposit. After I asked why they did that, because it was in my report, they CONVENIENTLY lost my walk through report and told me if I had a problem with it I had to prove it. I asked if they can check into their records to see that they had to send someone out to repair this issue and they told me they had no idea what I'm talking about. Also when I moved in the home owner did not have the house professionally cleaned. According to Bruce Lindberg he stated that when we moved out to just clean it about the same as we found it. So on our move out we cleaned it, vacuumed the carpets and wiped the kitchen clean. And because prudential had to send out a cleaning crew even after we moved in the house was cleaner than when we got it. But of course prudential took ($150) money out of my security deposit to have it cleaned again. I asked why they did that, because the house wasn't professionally cleaned when I got it and we were not instructed to have it professionally cleaned when we moved out and they said I didn't do a good enough job. They also said that the yard was not maintained and charged me another ($150) for a landscaper to come out and trim the bushes. Which is funny because after I moved out and get charged the $150.00 for yard work, I went to the property and took pictures of the yard and NO YARD WORK was done. So where did that $150 go? Right into the pockets of the crooks at Prudential. All in all I would strongly recommend working with any other property management group if you don't want to get scammed out of your security deposit. They will purposely lose your walk through sheet and just charge you whatever they want. They stole my money to repair existing issues on their property. And if I had a problem with it, tough, prove it. This office is filled with a small group of people covering each other's backs and screwing over their tenants. I have currently filed my complaints with the Attorney General's office and they are going to start looking into this group of individuals for other complaints like mine and assessing a fraud report. They also suggested that I seek legal council to obtain my losses. All this because Prudential did not want to be reasonable or fair with my money.
