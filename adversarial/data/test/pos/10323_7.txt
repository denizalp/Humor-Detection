It's a great local spot! Love their food and drinks...  and the customer service, awesome!\n\nI love a decent taco spot. This is my local taco spot in Vegas so far.\n\nOriginally, I came for the tacos. The tacos got my mouth watering every time. It tastes fresh and it's not too greasy.  I gorge on their burritos. Extra wet please! yum!!. I think I've tried almost everything the menu.\n\nThe cucumber, pineapple, spinach drink the lady made for me reminded me of my mornings in Cancun. I don't know what it is about that drink but I feel refreshed every time.\n\nFor a fast food local spot, it's top notch on my book.
