I was complete excited to find out that Marathon opened up a branch in Richmond Hill, so I didn't have to make the trek down to their original location.\n\nThe Milk tea is wonderful and while pricier than other places, it's well worth it to drop your coin on the Marathon Version of HK style Milk tea. \n\nEverything else, however, I can't say I'm a huge fan of their food, I guess my reaction to it, while the milk tea is easily the best thing on the menu, everything else is kind of meh.. to \"where is the flavour\" \n\nI definitely don't recommend the BBQ pork on rice; which the BF said was easily bland and forgettable.\n\nTheir satay beef macaroni isn't bad, but it isn't knock your socks off with flavor either. \n\nOverall - I'd say come for the milk tea, and a pineapple bun, everything else is just ok.
