Have fun with the T&A, boys, cuz ya ain't getting anything else worth the drive. Yes, they get decent reviews - but these are written in drool. \n\nIt's good the waitresses do dress like strippers, because service stinks. They are slow and dumb as posts. Seriously, better service at Denny's.\n\nWe sat ourselves, told them where we were and waited...and waited...and waited. Bleach-haired fishnets girl finally came over for our order. Cept we had a little problem...no menus. Took another 10 minutes. Got menus and water. Half an hour later, she returned for our orders. A member of our party very clearly ordered the margherita pizza, even pointed at the menu as she did so. 20 minutes later, the scantily clad blondie brought a margarita. The drink. Went back to the bar to order the correct thing. \n\nAnother 20 minutes later, my chicken pesto pizza with no tomatoes came out. With EXTRA tomatoes. Under the cheese. Sent it back, knowing full well it would only get uglier.\n\nFive minutes later, the margherita (pizza this time) finally came, it looked scarily similar to the tomatoey chicken pesto with the chicken picked off. Seriously, pesto margherita.\n\nKeep in mind that we were literally the only customers. There were six of us. \n\nAt the writing of this, we have been here for 2 hours. I'm sure they're spitting on my pizza. \n\nThey get two stars only - and I mean only - because the food, once you get it, is pretty good.\n\nUpdate, finally got my pizza. It was really yummy, but I waited so long that I was no longer hungry. My husband, who had eaten before coming was now famished, so at least it didn't go to waste. The waitress tried to make things right by giving us 50% off the remade pizza. Plus, we got that free margarita. Drink, not pizza.
