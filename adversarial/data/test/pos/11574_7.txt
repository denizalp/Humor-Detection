I havent flown in over 20 years and amazingly that last time was to this airport which I dont remember at all. The one thing I do remember was back in the day they had slots I dont remember seeing any. \n\nOn the flip side the bathroom is perfectly located for you to get to as soon as you walk in off the plane. That was a plus for me. \n\nThis airport is definitely better than LAX. It was smooth in and out for me. Easy access to a shuttle to grab the rental car. \n\nCant wait to come back to Vegas.  I may fly again.
