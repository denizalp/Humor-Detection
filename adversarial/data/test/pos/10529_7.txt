They were \"out of huevos rancheros\". What kind of Mexican restaurant runs out of beans, salsa and eggs?\n\nSomehow, after hearing the news, I didn't walk out. What got me was the Cafe de Olla (Meican sweetened coffee) that was listed on the menu. Well, well.\n\nMy Cafe de Olla turned out to be a watery mug of twigs and flotsam that had nothing to do with cinnamon or nutmeg.\n\nThis did nothing to wash away the tinny taste of the canned salsa.\n\nSo I went to talk with the owner afterwards...you know,,,see where he's from and all. Well, don't take the \"authentic Mexican\" claim seriously..that's all I can say.\n\nEven after a long day at Toronto Reference Library, save your pesos and go anywhere other than here.
