I love this place, maybe it was because the stars lined up perfectly or something.  We were hanging out with one of my favorite couples, we had a wonderful server, Matt, and the night was really great, though a little chilly for my Phoenician taste, lol.  I had a couple of flights of beer, Matt suggested them, since I am not an experienced beer drinker, he was spot on.  I loved them all.  We also had the schnitzel sliders, wow, they were awesome.  The pretzel was great, although we agreed that next time we should have shared.  We tried a couple of the sausages, I had a bite of each since I was so stuffed from everything else.  The lamb and the chorizo sausages are winners, again, those were great recommendations.  I can't wait to come back and try some other goodies.
