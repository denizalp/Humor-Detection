Sweet Lawd Baby Jesus! I've died and gone to Chocolate Heaven!\n\nI think we went into chocolate overindulgence overload in this place while visiting Montreal. It was too damn close to our hotel. Could not resist coming here a few times for lunch and a late night sugary snack. I think I caught the beetus here.\n\nHeck, just the smell alone wafting out the door here is intoxicating.\n\nNice French inspired bakery\/bistro decor. Terrific service. Super variety of items on the menu to eat and drink. Savory crepes, dessert crepes, frozen chocolate drinks, hot chocolate drinks, and so much more to put you into a chocolate coma. Forget the diet when dropping in here. Just go off on a rich chocolate feast. The menu has so many chocolate options on it you have a hard time deciding on just one. Everything we tried was prepared well.\n\nIf you are a chocolate lover this is a must visit when in the area.\n\nJust give me an insulin shot and all will be ok!
