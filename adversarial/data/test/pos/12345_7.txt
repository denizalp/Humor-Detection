This restaurant has gone down hill and still going. Had bad service 3 months ago, but decided to try again. It was a big mistake! Horrible service!! The worst I've had in years. I could list the numerous things that put me off from the last visit, but it's just not worth my time. But just for fun?  I'll list a few. \n\nWaiter getting our order wrong 4 times in one visit. Forgetting to ever get drinks after drink order was taken. Reminded twice. \nWaiter sitting on kitchen counter. GROSS! Couldn't recognize his own hand writing and came back to retake the order. And still got it wrong.  \nWhen complaint was voiced to the manager on duty. About the waiter, wrong sides, and chicken being very over done. The only thing I was offered was a free dessert. No sir. I will not have dessert. I wanted out of that restaurant as quickly as possible.  And you can't pay me to ever go back!! Stay clear.
