4.5 stars Such a fun experience - I'm from Connecticut and sadly we don't have drive-in burger spots like this. We drove in on a sunny Saturday afternoon from a road trip and found a spot. We learned that if you turn your lights on a young man will sprint over to you and ask what you need - do remember to turn your lights off unlike me who got scolded for forgetting to do so. So we ordered food to eat in the car - next time I'll ask for it to go as bagged up would be easier to deal with than that tray on a chilly day. \n\nWe ordered:\nGalley Burgers\nA cheeseburger with jalapeños & mustard\nA California & Florida \nFried mushrooms \nTeasers\nOnion rings \nA hot dog\n\nThe sides were amazing omg the mushrooms were so mushroom-y, the teasers were like fluffy jalapeño poppers - DELICIOUS!!! The galley boys were cooked well but we didn't like the burger sauce too sweet  (I know, I know) but would love a do over with just ketchup & pickles. \n\nThe California was a grape - ish soda & the Florida an orange-y soda both delicious but a small was definitely enough. \n\nThe kids running back and forth was a hoot and we tipped very well. My 85 year old dad was with us and suddenly got out of the car. We were puzzled but then watched as he started picking up all the change sprinkled all over the parking lot! We made sure to tip very well since my dad scammed someone's dropped $1.50 :\/ \n\nKnow that you will be waiting about 15 minutes for your order - it's not drive through fast but definitely worth the wait! (So Sorry my dad stole your quarters boys he's pretty sassy)
