Impressive for a soft opening!\n\nParking is tough, not sure the parking lot will be big enough.\n\nOrdered 4 piece combo. Took awhile to appear at the table but understandable.\n\nFood was hot and very tasty!\n\nProblems I felt was very cold and it is very loud. It was maybe 1\/2 full at 6:15 and we could not hear ourselves talk :(   Since they call your name for ypur order it makes it very hard because we could not hear our name called. Not sure what can be done about that.\n\nWe will be back so please look for an update ;)
