Masaharu Morimoto is one of the great sushi masters. He's finally arrived in Las Vegas in a very sleek and modern new space in the dining and shopping area of the MGM Grand. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience.\n\nI had the pleasure of visting Morimoto's original restuarant in Philedelphia last year. I had always watched him on Iron Chef and had heard good things about his growing restaurant empire. \n\nThe beverage menu is extensive but I decided on a Thai Basil Smash which is a gin drink with St. Germain, pineapple, basil and a few other ingredients. The menu is broken up into quite a few categories and as our waiter explained, things are served family-style.\n\nWe decided to do the sushi combination so that we would be able to try a variety of fish. This ended up being the chef's choice of assorted nigiri which came with 10 pieces of nigiri and a 6-piece tuna roll. All fabulous and incredibly fresh.\n\nFor dessert we settled on the panna cotta which was described in painstaking detail when it arrived to us. I remember the words 'bird's nest' being part of it. It was served with some refreshing sorbet on the side.\n\nDefinitely an experience to save the time (and money) for at least once when you are in Vegas. I look forward to trying other Morimoto restaurants in places both near and far.
