This was good for a first visit. Had never tried schnitzel before. The fries came with the combo, and a Fanta - orange mmmmm (remember the commercial Fanta Fanta Fanta).\n\nLoved the pickled veggies. I think I ate all the olives and carrots. Just FYI if we're eating this kinda food together and you don't like olives or carrots, lemme know ;)\n\nCozy atmosphere small diner, pleasant service and speaks English well. Very helpful in explaining dishes so I can choose. Pricing is what would be expected in the area. \n\nWould entertain dining here again for sure. But it may be a while as there are many places I'd love to try with this cuisine. And it's one of the best things to have here in Vegas.
