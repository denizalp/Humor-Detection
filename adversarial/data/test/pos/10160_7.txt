Our usual chef (Thurston) has always entertained us at the Hibachi while preparing our meal.  The laughs are always heard by all, because we laugh loud (lol).  Seriously, he is great!!\n\nThe food has always been ok and the prices are a bit steep for the portion sizes.  The service has always been good, but the manager seems to have a bit of attitude and isn't very personable. Several times we have made reservations on line and only to find out they don't always review their online reservations, so we end up calling in to verify they have our reservations,  \n\nThe Restaurant could be cleaner on the inside, we see the same dirt and dust on the floor the last 3 times we have gone there.  It's as if it's ignored.  It's a definite turn off. \n\nAll in all, the chef makes the meal very entertaining, but that doesn't make up for the other lower areas that should be improved.
