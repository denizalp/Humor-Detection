Hey have you heard have you heard that White Rabbit opened a brick and mortar location right here in Vegas? Where you say? Right off Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn, the same plaza as 168 market.\n\nI've only had White Rabbit candy. Anything from this White Rabbit or the food truck prior to this? Nope, but I've heard a lot of great things about them. They do have a good fan base a lot of people like them. They may have been featured in some tv show or newspaper\/magazine. Honestly I don't even know, just heard their a foodtruck and that people like them. I liked their customer service.\n\nA group from work went here after having heard they opened. I told the staff that we've never had them and wanted something they were known for or was fans raved about. The sisig was suggested without hesitation. So I was hoping it was gonna be amazing. No one in the group liked it.  It was pretty bad that I had to eat sisig somewhere else to satisfy my craving. It was pretty dry and didn't taste right at some parts, mushy at others. It remembered me of a overcooked mixture of canned corned beef and some other items. What I got, the rice bowl combo with drink was about $8-9 food truck size and price, wasn't filling. \n\nI probably wouldn't go back. But at least they have other items other than sisig and have a fan base.
