A hidden gem on the southwest side.  We love juice places and in Las Vegas, a good juice place is hard to find.  Yes, there are a few places which have cold pressed juice in bottles, but a lot of the juices over lap ingredients.  \n\nWe have found a few great places in California and many times wished someone would open a place in Vegas that will make some GREAT fresh Organic juice at a decent price.  HERE IS IT FINALLY!!!!\n\nWe walk in the door and the ambiance of the place is AWESOME unlike any other place in town.   They have seats at the bar and a few other seats around.  Matt greeted us, he is friendly and very knowledgeable.  They have 17 different juices and 3 milks and my favorite part of this place compared to all the others in town, you have a HUGE selection of juices without ginger.  The point is the juices here are unique in their own way and taste great.\n\nIt's like someone from California finally came to Vegas and brought an AMAZING juice place with them.  You can sit at the bar, if your first time here, they give you a very cute little wooden board and a real mini cup, not plastic, and you can sample all 20 if you desire.  There are HUGE signs as well as a small card which lists all the ingredients and prices in clear view, there are no hidden costs here.\n\nThis juices are AWESOME, the price of most juices are a little cheaper then the others in town and they have a loyalty program, you give them your phone number and work your way to a free juice.  \n\nThis place is worth the drive until they open another one closer to the Green Valley area.  Needless to say we left with 8 bottles and will be back.  Did I mention the juice choices and tastes are unique and AMAZING???  They even have a Happy Hour..   Rush on over to this place, oh wait no don't, I like that it was easy in and not crowded.
