Premium Outlets South is the indoor mall. This was a good thing since the day we went, it was storming. I still prefer the North as it's almost double the size. Ann Taylor, Nike, Hush Puppies, Lane Bryant, Hot Topic, and Sean John were some of the stores that I'd seen. This mall is definitely long. I felt like I was walking forever. Along the way, we saw two food courts. \n\nI didn't find the prices at the outlets here to be much cheaper than the regular retail stores. I live in Hawaii and the prices here were comparable to home. I didn't end up buying anything. I wasn't about to buy something that was a dollar or two cheaper to lug it home.\n\nIf you check in on your Yelp app you get the free coupon book which usually costs $10. The lady working behind the counter said that I was the first person she encountered who did this. She'd never seen the check in before and didn't know about it. She just gave me the book anyway.
