I'm always wary of seafood in land-locked states, but Bluewater Grill is classy and delicious.  This would be a great place to take your lover, or your family, or just get together as a bunch of friends and enjoy the food and some drinks!\n\nThe clam chowder is very respectable (I think they have both kinds, but I had the New England) and the fish and chips is nothing to scoff at either.  My lover had the scallops and they were done to perfection.
