Went for a special occasion!  \n\nLooking forward to Wild Rosemary Bistro  \"Exquisite food preparation\"; \"Where Good Things Will Come To You\", per Wild's card.  \n\nBYOB, which is great!  $6 fee for corkage is well worth it.\n\nVery small, six tables, must have reservations.  \n\nVery load, hard to hear across the table.  It was so load I wanted to screeeeeeeeammmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!  \n\nFood preparation was wonderful.  Starter was grilled asparagus and tomatoes.  Very tasty and well prepared.   Had lamb chops with stuffed grape leaves and a miniture stuffed zuc, and it came with a small salad.  The veggies and salad were wonderful.  Ordered medium rare and it came medium well.   W meat was cooked the same and was ordered medium rare.   This is disappointing for this type of place!\n\nDessert list was nice we shared a plum souffle that was tart and delicious.
