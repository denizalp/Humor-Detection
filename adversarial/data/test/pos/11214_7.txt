Gentlemen, start you engines.\n\nWeather was bad in HTX and nothing happening so thought I would go search for an alternative location. Needed to get some flying hours in so I rang my pal and asked if he was making a trip anywhere this weekend and needed a co-driver. \n\"Not going anywhere but you can take the wings if you want.\" \nNever a look a gift plane in the props. Deal. \nMade a few calls grabbed the swag bag and headed to the airfield and met up. Ride West was bumpy but I like it like that, makes it more interesting. \n\nFrom previous visits I know the best deal is the Club floor with a room on the Pontevecchio Bridge. Each room comes with a balcony overlooking the Lake and provides access to the Club lounge with a dedicated concierge. You get continuous culinary offerings throughout the day breakfast, light snacks, 'horses doofers', beverages and sweets and it is all complimentary. Yes, read it and weep! \n\nThis location is surrounded by all the amenities you need for - live music, exercising, gambling,  shopping and a million other things. The strip is a Ritz courtesy car away if you want to go but, why leave this oasis in the desert. \n\nBooked Saturday Afternoon Tea in the Firenze as part of the reservation. Got checked in, showered and trotted off for delicious finger sarneys followed by freshly baked scones and champagne strawberry jam with Clotted cream before heading out for a ride round the lake. \nBack for the steam and massage in the spa then togged up for dinner in the Medici. \n...shared the Fried Buffalo Mozzarella, Roasted Eggplant and Aged Balsamic Vinegar \nthen \nDungeness Crab, Asparagus Risotto and Mascarpone Cheese \nRosemary-Grilled Lamb Chops infused with Balsamic Mint Essence \nrounded off with Armagnacs. \n\nThe RC dining experience is always without equal wherever you are in the World and we were not let down here......everything was perfectly cooked and delivered.\n \nHeaded off to the on site casino, luck be a Lady tonight..you know how it goes..... Nose down, tail up....... ; )\n\nYou should try this little slice of heaven and remember, go hungry and get a Club floor room. You can eat and drink the equivalent of your bill.
