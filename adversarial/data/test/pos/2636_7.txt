Derek and Lissette are awesome! They really know dogs and they love what they do. They're available whenever you need them and they are the best in the business. I've hired other dog trainers that you can just tell, aren't passionate and don't return calls\/texts. These guys are honest and they're invested in helping you improve your relationship with your pups.
