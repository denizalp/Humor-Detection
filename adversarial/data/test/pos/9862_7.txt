I guess I should really base my reviews on something other than the talent in the place, but that'll never happen. Supposedly everybody looks the same after a few drinks. But, after sighting Ron Jeremy here during th porn convention, I would have to say he is the ugliest MF I've ever seen. Anyways, as far as the club goes, it is a new Vegas hotspot, with high priced drinks, and hot girls surrounding the bar. Aside from the 3 hour waits that sometimes come with going to Tao, I would recommend it with anybody. Also, having some females with you helps alot in terms of getting you in.
