Such a subjective topic to Yelp about- but to score a \"First,\" I will do it.\n\nCurrently, I am a student and it has been amazing to live so close to school but yet be able to leave the campus every day.  Several of my classmates live on-campus and  have to be 'at school' 24 hrs a day....\n\nFor perspective apartment seekers- I'd say 70%, if not more, are Midwestern students. I'd consider this a plus because we are all a bunch of book nerds trying to get through school so we are very QUIET. Additionally, we don't want to get into trouble so we are very reluctant to vandalize, steal, or liter on premise. :)\n\nI have Loved having all my appliances \"in-unit\" (having moved from Chicago, W\/D in-unit was a myth to behold), zero-entry (pool has a sand bar that you can pull a recliner onto, have your feet in the water, and study Biochem all at the same time), and the Price. I have a two-bedroom and pay $950. \n\nThe staff is pretty normal. They do the courteous, hand-waive-salute thing when you drive by. They are really great at getting any complaints or broken things dealt with in a timely manner. San Lagos does host a few parties throughout the year with an open bar and free food which is pretty tight.\n\nI have also been fortunate to have a view that faces one of the several ponds. There is the potential to have a hideous view of Home Depot and the rest of 'that' strip mall. There are also a few resident ducks that waddle around and add a little character to the grounds.\n\nAs I approach rotations I am considering moving- only because most of my rotations are scheduled at the VA, AZ Heart, etc. and are located in downtown Phoenix. Also, I'm considering getting a doggy and San Lagos prohibits dogs. I believe they allow cats... but WHO wants one of those?!? ;)\n\nBUT I really hate moving so who knows.
