When menchies first came to markham, I LOVED it. Like, I literally fell head over heels in love with it. I had an affair, eloped and went on a honeymoon with menchies. It was an addiction. It got so bad, I found myself coming back every day over and over again even though it hit me like a truck of calories. \nBut still, I was intrigued. I was astonished by the amount of ever-changing flavours and the abundance of toppings ranging from fresh fruit, popping boba, crunchy cereals and chewy gummies. I never knew I could love it so much. \n\nBut I guess it's true what they say- after a honeymoon period, you just get comfortable with the relationship. Then you tolerate. Then it's just over. Menchies and I just grew apart.\n\nToday I revisited menchies again after our break up long-ago. The old familiar atmosphere makes me miss it a bit every time I do. Never again will I be the high school girl blinded by the love of so many different tasty flavours. Now I see menchies for who it truly is- barely working, sticky machines with some sort of residue on the inner walls and the handles. Don't get me wrong, this would be my paradise as a child. But now, all I see is a sticky mess that I don't want to be near for longer than a few minutes. Unlike my old self, I now only get my favourite flavour: purely tart. (Tastes like a tangy greek yogurt, yum!) & instead of loading my cup to $8-9 worth of overpriced snacks that probably come from bulk barn, I only stick with one topping (probably froot loops or some mochi) \n\nMenchies, you've been a good part of my life and you'll definitely be a great part of some other student (from UHS probably). But I'm glad our phase is over.\n\nPs. check the pictures of celebrities awkwardly eating menchies on the wall.
