My daughter went here after her fresh ear piercing stud fell out and was lost in the shower. She did not get her piecing here but since she lived nearby, she thought she'd pick up another pair of studs quickly. \n\nA heavy set man waited on her and proceeded to rudely blast the place that did the piercings, telling her that they put them in crooked\/slanted. He kept ranting about the sloppy job they did. I found this very unprofessional. He made her think they ruined her piecing and there is nothing she could do to fix it. (None of this was true, they put them in just fine). She just wanted a pair of replacement studs, not some arrogant jerk telling her how bad her piercing was done because she didn't go to CT. She was almost in tears when she left. \n\nAnother thing - he told her the replacements studs, which were ugly chrome balls, were $20. When she went to pay, he inexplicably charged her $40! I can't even imagine how much it would have been if she had her ears pieced there! \n\nDon't go here unless you want to way over pay for a loud mouth to tell you how CT is the only reputable place in town - BS!
