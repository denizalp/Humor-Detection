I recently visited with the Yelp Supper Club and we had about 10+ people in our group (great turn out). While Solon is a bit of a hike from Cleveland I love seeing other suburbs and trying new restaurants. This place is decorated in what I consider to be \"Trendy\". Not too modern but bright and clean enough to make me feel like I am about to have a great experience. \n\nWe had 2 servers for our table and thought they did a great job getting our food in a timely manner and checking in on us periodically. I ordered the Lovely Bird which is a chicken sandwich with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato Jam and Brussels Sprouts. I thought it was divine! I love the idea of brussels sprouts on a sandwich! The fried tasted like Penn Station fries- definitely a A+ in my book!
