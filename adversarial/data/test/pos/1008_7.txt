This was my favorite club in Vegas and one of the best clubs I've been to period. Gorgeous decor, plenty of lounging, great music, stripper poles open to anyone brave enough to show off her (or his :p) skills and a big-ish dancefloor, but the best part was the pool area. Nothing like dancing and splashing around in a pool, drink in hand with your best girls :)
