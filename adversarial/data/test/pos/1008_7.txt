Excellent job. I used the mailer to get names of garage door companies, as the outside weatherstripping around the garage doors was torn and cracked and clearly not keeping anything out, and no clue what to do.\n\nI got a nice lady on the phone, and she asked if it was an emergency and she could have someone out that day. Nope! so, she scheduled me for the next week. An older guy came (you know when they're older, they for SURE know what they're doing, right?) and he was great. Got it done quickly and took my check. He gave me a receipt, and apparently there was supposed to be a $50 service fee that they waived (nice). They didn't, however, waive the $12 or 12.50 fuel charge (which they forgot to mention, but since I had read yelp reviews I was kinda expecting it). \n\nWe have a 3-car garage, and to replace the one double-door, sides and top, and the single-door, sides and top, plus the fuel charge, it was around $250. I needed it done quickly, as the painter was coming to paint the house (DARN those HOA ppl) and I didn't want to have to repaint things after he was done).   Thanks, A1!  Will definitely call you if I have other garage door issues :)
