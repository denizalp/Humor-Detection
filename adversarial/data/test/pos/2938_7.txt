Our new favorite breakfast spot in the area!\n\nAs new \"locals\", we've been trying many places on a frequent basis. On Mother's Day, we decided to try this out and instantly became fans!\n\nMy #1 advice: CHECK IN via Yelp! \n \nWe checked in on our way to BC and were able to receive constant updates. Once we arrived, we were seated within 5 minutes. If we would've waited to put our names down after arriving, we could've easily waited for 50 minutes or longer. There is also a parking lot adjacent to the restaurant, which is very convenient. \n\nOnce seated, Ryan and I tried their amazing Bloody Mary! It has be one of the best Bloody Marys we've ever had! The rest of the review can be solely on the Bloody Mary but we'll move on!\n\nService was outstanding. Our hostess and waitress were very friendly, attentive, and quick! Our food came out  fast considering how busy it was. Everything (Salmon Bene, Pancakes, and Southwest burrito) was fresh and super delicious!\n\nAlthough we sat inside, there is also outdoor & bar seating available . The restaurant is at the intersection of Scottsdale & Drinkwater- perfect for people watching ;)\n\nI also received a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry for Mother's Day! How cute is that?! \n\nWe highly recommend!
