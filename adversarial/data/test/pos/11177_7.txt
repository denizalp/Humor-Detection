Good: everyone was pretty nice, good time management\n\nNot so good: the girl sitting at the front desk just sat talking on the phone (it sounded like a personal call, otherwise I would not have cared) for several minutes before she acknowledged me. \nThe nurse's assistant was all kinds of shady. All of his fingernails were trimmed except for his overgrown pinky fingers, and he was sniffling the whole time I was there. So either he had a cold (which, he shouldn't have been there if that was the case!) or he enjoys a line of booger sugar now and then. In response to my discomfort when he had to draw my blood, he responded that I should like needles, and then he went on about how cool needles are. At least he distracted me from the blood drawing. \nThe facility itself was a little run-down and out of date.
