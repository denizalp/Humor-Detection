Horrible customer service. I went in to see if they would check if my glasses were the same prescription as my new prescription and they refused to check! They said they had no monetary motivation to get my glasses checked because I did not purchase those glasses from their store. I went to two other stores and they were super nice and checked my glasses and cleaned them too. If you are thinking of buying, expect that they will do nothing for you if they don't get any money for it.
