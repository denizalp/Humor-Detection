Mesa Airlines does not deserve one star.  This is worst airline I have ever encountered.  Beware the flight from Leon Airport, Mexico to Houston.  There is a male, obese, balding, middle-aged surly flight attendant that can ruin your vacation.  Take any other airline home from Mexico if you don't want your trip RUINED.
