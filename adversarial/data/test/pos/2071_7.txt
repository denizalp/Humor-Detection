This BB&B is pretty great. It meets all my needs, stock is always full and if something is off the shelf, ask customer service associate, they will check if there is any in the stock room. Staff has always been very helpful and friendly. \nSometimes I find myself pointlessly roaming the isles looking for nothing but always finding something I \"need\". The store is not too busy, clean, and orderly making shopping there a breeze.
