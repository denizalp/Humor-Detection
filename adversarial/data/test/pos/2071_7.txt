A bunch of yelpers came out(just 11 hours after killing udon, ramen and sushi for 3 hours!) for Jen S.' UYE , and about half of us have never dined here yet, so we eagerly waited in anticipation after hearing the rave reviews.\n\nAs you step inside, the atmosphere immediately sucks you in, so homey, a little bit of pintrest, and so inviting, great combo of color, wood, and stone in perfect harmony,\nHoney Salt could easily make you feel like you were in Napa Valley wine country.\nMismatched chairs, random mirrors, chandeliers, and lamps placed along the banquettes(so comfy, makes you wanna grab one of the pillows and take a nappy-nap\nafter a fantabulous meal!) Check out the decor in the restrooms too-Sportscards and restaurant menus in the men's room, Hotel key cards in the women's room...total coolness. Love the Service staff attire too....Flannel looking collared  shirts, jeans, and Chuck Taylors? SWEET! Even Chef Kim Canteenwalla was rockin' jeans and chucks with his chef whites...Now that's what's up!\n\nLavash and Potato Rolls with white bean puree arrive as we place our orders, and wifey decides on the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich -Two crisp juicy chicken breasts with slaw and  honey mustard on a soft brioche bun served with Honey Salt's version of a chopped salad full of romaine, kale, carrots, white cheddar, radish, edamame, and avocado...a very good compliment to the very tasty sandwich that has been nicknamed \"Chik-Fil-A on crack\" (I never had CFA, so I wouldn't really know)\n\n I go with the Backyard Favorite Burger. A huge burger(ground from tri-tip, chuck, and shortrib) that protrudes outside the pilowy soft brioche bun topped with sweet tomato jam, butter lettuce, tomato, red onion, and beehive cheddar...only slight knock was that the fries weren't hot like they should be... Now this burger has got to be one of THE BEST in town, not only hands down, but hands, face and knees down, like bow down status! Simplicity at its finest and executed flawlessly. Order this bad boy medium rare and get that fried egg on top and you won't be disappointed!\n\nQuality ingredients alone will draw me back here and  its not about quantity(quadruple bypass @ Heart Attack Grill anyone?) and the price point is not absolutely ridonkulous like on the strip ($50 for Carne Asada? What is it? Kobe Beef stuffed with Foie and Truffles???)\n\nGot to meet Vanessa N. who dined with us and Terri R. who was dining nearby, and I also ran into Luis (formerly from Slidin' Thru) and he raved about the Dinner menu, so a return trip is planned for sure. If you haven't dined here yet, what are you waiting for? GETCHOA$$OVAHEA!!!!!......ALOHA!!!
