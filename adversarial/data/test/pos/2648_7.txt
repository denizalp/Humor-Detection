We went here the other night and all I can say is holy slowness. 2 young ladies working on a Friday night is just bad planning. We got our treats pretty quickly but it got busy. None of us finished so I wanted lids for our ice cream. My husband stood in line for 20 minutes and never got recognized. He ended up finding lids near the spoons and grabbed those. \nI am not impressed. Get those poor girls some help. Only 1 of them was able to get ice cream while the other one was stuck in back making waffles or whatever it is that needs to be baked.\nI don't understand why someone who works for this business would come on Yelp and start attacking my review. Good luck keeping your business afloat in Vegas!! Ice cream shops are a dime a dozen our here.
