I grew up in Vegas. I used to DJ at Gypsy back in the day. However, I do not come to Piranha\/8 1\/2 when I visit Vegas. I prefer to go to Krave or one of the other venues in town. I do not care to pay $20 for entry for this club because I am not a local. Drinks tend to be hella weak and over priced as well. I just do not feel welcome here. I recommend anyone visiting Vegas to stay away. Don't waste your money here.
