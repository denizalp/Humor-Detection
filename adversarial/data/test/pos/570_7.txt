Hmmm... Where do I begin? I haven't lived here as long as some (avg 7 years) and I'm not as new as though who have applied under our new management\/owners Beztak. I have a lot of opinions, but opinions don't pay rent or explain to researchers exactly what it's like to live here. So I will put my life on a brief pause to finally leave a review...\n\nFirst off, I don't know why more people don't leave reviews. I have some ideas-nobody really wants to be put on the spot to 'shout-out' what they think about where they live WHILE they are still living there. \n\nSo let's break it down 'Candise' style: \n\nTHE BIG, THE BAD, & THE UGLY\n\nIf you don't know that phrase, google it. \n\nTHE BIG: \n\nCascade Falls is located on a hill in the midst of Merriman Valley. Unlike any property in this area, we have the best view hands down! Why? There are no trees to block our horizon. Timber Top is across the street along with a few other communities; however, they were built higher up and more like a plateau. It's surrounded by trees. Every community in this area is either too flat or too enclosed to appreciate the natural landscape of the Valley. The architects and original owners chose a sight in the heart of Native territory. The architectural landscape is timeless. Regardless of where you live once you step onto your patio you are under a blanket of skies! \n\nThis area has wonderful diversity. Our school district (WOODRIDGE), is one of the best in our Nation. I (having attended private schools for elementary and Jr. High) can confidently tell parents to save money and put it towards college. Children attending WOODRIDGE are just as if not more competitive than any school system in Ohio-let alone, The Unites States. Test scores are public record and if you don't believe me, Google God. \n\nConvenience: The school bus comes directly to our community. \n\nBeztak plans monthly community events for children and adults. Attending is a great way to meet your neighbors, make new friends and feel like you live within a community versus a condo setting. \n\nIt's very quiet here. I feel completely safe walking at night or taking a jog at dusk. \n\n\nTHE BAD: \n\nCascade Falls is located on a hill. The day you sign your lease, invest in great all season tires and good breaks. The City does a fantastic job salting and icing; however, this doesn't matter if there is a flash storm or snow or rain. The main road (Portage Trail), has little lights because residents like the feel of a country setting. \n\nThere are no sidewalks if you like to walk like me or bike to work. Heading towards State Road, there is almost always a cop after you past Speedway (I think that's the name) so remember it's 35 mph not 55 and accelerating. \n\nFor reasons, I don't understand-most of our village is 40% lit. I admit being terrified to take out the trash after dark. Once a saw a raccoon so big sitting on the dumpster, I got back into my car and decided it'd be better to come back when his shift was over! \n\nBeware of deer. There aren't a lot, but you never know when one will jump out and attack your car. \n\nTHE UGLY: \n\nThis property was originally called The WATERFORD Apartments. It was created for people who did not exceed a certain income. These apartments have always been beautiful. Some people were furious that a place was being built that would integrate the then called 'Caucasian Falls'. Over time this area has grown in diversity but ignorance is still home breed. Most of our children enjoy school and our community. Any circumstances or issues that seem out of the ordinary should be brought to the schools\/manager attention. There are good kids and bad kids. Thery grow up to be good adults and bad adults. \n\nI believe anyone who is a law abiding citizen who desires to live here should be able to. It shouldn't matter what your net worth is. I don't think families should be rejected because they have a Section 8 voucher. I also don't think families should be rejected because they make $60,000 a year. I believe every home deserves upgraded appliances and the entire speal about the 'upgraded' units should be thrown out. All this does is further separate a community. For example, I've lived here for over 3 years. I have a Section 8 voucher. This voucher (based on my income), pays rent to Beztak. Before Beztak it paid my rent to others. Regardless of how rent is paid, everyone who lives at Cascade Falls has paid it! Our rent has never been cheap, but the requirements are ridiculous. I see it like an unbearable tax on the working class. When a community is built from the ground up, a company can charge as they wish. When a community files Bankruptcy because of embezzlement and wickedness hidden behind office doors-the entire community should not be punished-even when that community is bought for $30 million dollars outright. Regardless who owns this property, my rent (our neighbors and friends) is paid.  The entire community deserves a facelift. \n\nI was not paid for my review.
