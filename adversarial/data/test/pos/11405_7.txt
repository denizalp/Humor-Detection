This college is the reason young people are turned off towards going to college. Trying to declare a major is like trying to find a way to bathe a cat. I searched the internet trying to find out how to declare a major, and everything I did told me to bring in paperwork. Okay, not a problem. Not a problem until you get there, and the information office is LITERALLY hanging up on people who are trying to get a hold of the Registrar's office. (Good thing I came to the campus, right? Wrong.) The lady at the information desk (the one hanging up on people) told me in order to talk to the registrar, I had to sign in on the kiosk. Fine, not a problem. Problem! The kiosk SHUT DOWN because so many people were trying to talk to the registrar. Again, I go online and try to declare a major online, and again, there's no way to do it. Because of this, I am now losing a $10,000 scholarship. Not happy.
