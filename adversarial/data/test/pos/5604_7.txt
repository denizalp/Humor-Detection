OK Newmarket and GTA, it's time for me to lay some northern knowledge on all a y'all! Something is happening in Newmarket... something wonderful. From Davis drive to Mulock new business is booming and they're throwing away the healthy trends in exchange for big unadulterated flavour!\n\nAfter losing my left and right leg to Home Outfitters moments before, I was looking for tasty, comfort food at a decent price. It was then that I noticed the large Philthy Phace of Philly's on a bright orange sign only a few doors away. If you're not familar with the area, it's located in the Goodlife plaza on the South -east corner of Davis Drive and Yonge street.\n\nIn a world where up is down, black is white and bad is good, then Philthy is clearly code for PHREAKING PHANTASTIC. No Phucking around!! (see it doesn't count as swearing if you don't write the actual word).\n\nIt's a simple take away joint, the first of it's kind offering two main menu items and that's it: Poutine and Philly Cheesesteaks. D-LISH!\n\nThere are approximately 8 different varieties of poutine ranging from original to a bacon steak burger (yes bacon and steak on poutine). And if that's not enough food for you, you've got about 6-8 variations of cheesesteaks to choose from as well.\n\nI always feel it's best to evaluate a food style on it's basics and then expand from there. I went for their supreme philly which was PHILTHY (in a good way). It's exactly as they're made in Philadelphia right down to being coated in Whiz (cheese Whiz that IZ...). You get 6oz of steak, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers all on a fresh top cut bun, and if whiz iznt your thing, no worries you have 3 other cheese options available to you (Cheddar, Swiss OR Provolone).\n\nFor my money this was a fantastic sandwich, and for only being 6 months young, they've got a concept that I know is going to be a huge hit here in the 'burbs and beyond!\n\nLooking forward to many a philthy meal in the phuture!\n\nEatcrest Out!
