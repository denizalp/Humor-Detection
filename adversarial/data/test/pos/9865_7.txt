While waiting for my movie time, I decided to grab lunch at ABC. I asked for coffee which was bitter. I asked for tomato\n sauce for my cheese tomato panini, i was told that the sauce would be an additional $4. The sandwich was already $10 for just cheese and tomato. The gentlemen owner was not very friendly and would not provide sauce of any kind free. He was also looking at me crudely when I used my phone. I do not recommend this \"snobby\" place.
