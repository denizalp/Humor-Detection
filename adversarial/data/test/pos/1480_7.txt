Note #1: Tuesday-Friday they are closed in the afternoon between 2:30 and 5. On weekends the same occurs between 3 and 5. This is due to the restaurant's transition between lunch and dinner. I wasn't able to convey that when I added the hours to the listing. \n\nNote #2: The Mintt's menu consists of \"South Indian, North Indian, and Indo Chinese\" fare.\n\nDad was owed a double birthday\/belated Father's Day dinner and wanted Indian food as he is wont to do. Wanting to trying a place other than Namaste (I will still stand by them) for farts 'n chuckles, he decided on The Mintt.\n\nMan, the Banksville Road Restaurant Ramayana is underway, isn't it? Watch out for Rama's arrows! \n\nIn all earnestness, Dad and the rest of the family were more than happy with our takeout dinner, finding that it matched culinary wits with neighboring Namaste superbly. \n\nEach time we order Indian takeout, a side-splitting game of \"What's What?\" occurs, and you'd better believe we try each other's dish. We usually each pick something, get it home, and engage in a feeding frenzy until the innately filling nature of Indian food (that's been my experience) begins to get the better of us. Here's what made up our meal...\n\nChicken 65 ('Deep fried boneless chicken in spicy ginger, garlic,\nred chili and ground black pepper marinade.')\n\nChicken Biryani\n\nHandi Goat ('Goat cooked with ground meat, spices and fresh\nherbs.')\n\nLamb Curry\n\nChicken Curry\n\nTandoori Combination Grill\n\nLasani Gobi ('Deep fried battered cauliflower florets tossed with\nfresh garlic, chili and green onion.')\n\nGarlic Naan (they have about 15 types of bread, but we played it safe, going with Dad's favorite)\n\nAside from the somewhat dry Tandoori chicken (something that doesn't usually hold up well in transit), everything was up the the standards we've become accustomed to when it comes to Indian fare; tender, flavorful, fiery. However, the Chicken Biryani came with a twist: Cinnamon! And it worked wonderfully for me. \n\nThe sleeper dish for me was the Lasani Gobi in that it made me enjoy cauliflower, something I couldn't get excited about even when it was deep fried and served at a bar. I guess all it took was some garlic, chilis, and green onions to win me over. \n\nGoat is...interesting. Yes, it was new to me. Mintt serves it on the bone. It's basically a less supple lamb to my teeth and palate. \n\nThe Mintt's Chicken 65 makes typical chicken tenders passe. The duo of curry dishes were a little \"darker\" (not sure if there's a better descriptor)  in flavor than Namaste's. Their naan was as pliable, blistered, and tasty as they come. \n\nI couldn't give a winged pickle about authenticity and haven't the free-time or funds to travel to India to find out about it. Good is good, and we all found that our meal from The Mintt was rathergood like those legendary viking kittens from the intrawebs!\n\nhttp:\/\/users.wolfcrews.com\/toys\/vikings\/
