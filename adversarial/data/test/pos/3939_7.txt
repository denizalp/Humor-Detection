The smell when you walk in the place is pretty good. Especially when it is cold outside.\nThere is a wonderful smell of sauce and spice cooking. Love it.\nThe staff here is friendly and the decor is great!\nIt is always a busy place. They recently put coupons out so that makes them even busier.\nFood is very good here. Nice and hot as well.\nIt can get beyond loud when everyone is in here. This is a trend i have noticed more than once. Lots of noise.\nBut, food is good and the price is great. Bathrooms are clean.\nSounds like a plan!
