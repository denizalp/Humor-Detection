Frankly, Omnia was a MAJOR let down. And when I say MAJOR, I mean it. Because I spent money to get in and literally walked out in 30 mins because I couldn't stand the crowd any more.\nI signed up for the guest list to check the place out on Saturday, 1\/30\/2016. But that was very naive of me because every Tom, Dick, Harry and their uncles, aunts and grandmothers also signed up on the guest list and expected to get in. Thankfully, because we were guests at the Nobu hotel, we had our own line to get in. And didn't have to wait in lines that passed the casino all the way into the main lobby. It's literally chaotic.\nAnd these fools let anyone and everyone inside. Come on, please gauge the crowd you are letting in. And please see their faces! Not an ounce of class inside. \n\nWe paid, walked into the Heart of Omnia, which is where they play hiphop. There wasn't any place to stand and it literally was a sausage fest inside. We then decided to check out the rooftop, but that was obviously closed. The only place left was where they were playing EDM and it sucked. I like good EDM, but the DJ's that night were horrible.The bars are hard to access because whoever designed this place decided to put tables everywhere. \n\nYeah I get it, they want you to buy a table. Then don't let that many people inside because god forbid there's an accident or a fire incident, people will die inside and get stampeded on! \nI just chugged my drink and couldn't wait to get the f*ck out.\nIf it's like this when an average to subpar DJ(s) plays music, I wonder what it will be like when someone renowned plays.\nIf I ever decide to go back, I am getting a table.
