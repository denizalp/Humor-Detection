Quick public service announcement: if you don't get a waffle cone here, you're a fool.  My jaw drops every time I see someone get ice cream in a cup here.  It's a fresh baked outrageously good waffle cone, people. With an M&M for added leak prevention.  If you don't go for it you're just being stubborn.       \n\nOver the years I've brought many out-of-towners to Dave & Andy's to get the best cone in Pittsburgh. If you're into toppings they did the \"manually bash up candy bars\" thing way before Cold Stone or Marble Slab.  As far as I'm concerned the only place close to this is Handel's, but if you put a gun to my head this is No. 1.
