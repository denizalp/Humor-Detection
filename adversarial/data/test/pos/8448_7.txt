What can I say that's positive about this trader Joe's? For one the only reason why we come here is for the simple food options. Makes cooking for my wife and I a breeze. That's about it. \n\nLet's talk about the Negatives (yes, with a capital \"N\".) Parking lot is horrible, they always seem to have crates blocking spots. Trying to leave the parking lot is a feat in itself. \n\nWhat really made me angry was a crew member that was checking people out at a register. They were slammed, so I had a good 2 minutes in line to witness something absurd. The woman who was getting checked out had her kids with her and one of them was running around, as kids do sometimes (crazy, I know!) The crew member Samantha proceeded to scold this woman's children, not only in front of their mother, but in front of everyone else that was checking out. She even went on to explain why they shouldn't be \"running in a business\".  The audacity! Listen, I know she basically said what everyone thinks to themselves when they see kids running wild, but they weren't even that bad. Bottom line, your job is to ring out groceries Samantha, not to lecture some random person's kids. (it didn't look like they knew each other or anything, but even so, its the perception of it all.)\n\nAfter being dumbfounded from witnessing the liberal lecture of this employee, I contemplated whether I should go to her line or not, since it was faster than the one I was in. Not wanting to stand there all night I decided to jump in her line. Now, I don't know much about these new chips in these debit cards that banking institutions are sending out to customers. I do however know that they have not decommissioned the functionality of the actual strip that the majority of the population is used to using. Samantha proceeds to order me to use the chip in my new card. Talk about a bottle neck situation. You're already backing up a line with yelling at someone's kids, and now you're going to try and demand that I use my chip in my card. It wasn't the proper time to \"educate\" your customer on how to use their new card. I could care less about some chip in my card. All I told Chase Bank, when I found out they were sending me a different card, was that I cared to keep my Chicago skyline background on my card. I playfully laugh it off, joking that I don't like change, and that I could have just swiped my card. The thing that rubbed me wrong the most was her comment before I left. \"Here's your receipt. Now go back to Chicago.\" (She obviously saw my card with the skyline on it.) I brush it off and reply with saying that Phoenix is home now. She even had the gall to say something about my \"Chicago accent\" as I was leaving. I don't know where all this resentment to Chicagoans that move out to Phoenix came from, but it's not appreciated. Nor is it acceptable in a business setting, especially when I'm the customer. \n\nI personally will not be going back to this store. Samantha needs to learn her boundaries as a customer service representative and as the face of Trader Joe's.
