I can't even comment on the food they serve here. Reason being, there was no food to be served. Arrived at the restaurant, never was greeted but only to sit down next to the bar. No problem with that, except no one even tried to acknowledge us. Sat unwaited for about 15 mins, being clearly visible to the wait staff. Left disappointed and clearly upset with the unprofessionalism and discern of the staff at mellow mushroom. I should give them 0 stars but you can't. Never tasted the food and staff was rude. Disappointed customer!!
