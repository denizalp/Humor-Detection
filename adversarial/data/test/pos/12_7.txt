Duuuuuuude you have absolutely no idea how much money these guys saved me. I am broke, like most college students and usually don't get my financial aid until after the semester starts. DID YALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A PAY LATER OPTION??? I tell them I need a book and am not able to pay the full amount until financial aid comes in, THEN YOU PAY LIKE A MONTH LATER. Freaking life-savers. I love the manager, the assistant manager, Angel (who originally helped me out),  and Madison (I think her name is, pretty girl in the front). The whole staff is so great that every time I go in I get to greeted and helped by a different person but am equally as satisfied. LOW PRICES, AMAZING STAFF, PAY LATER, ALL THE BOOKS I EVER NEEDED. THANK YOU RENTTEXT, You will forever be my soul mate.
