Ohmigosh.. my mouth is watering just thinking about eating at Original Cuisine!  Knowing my love for Asian food, a friend took me here, and it was probably the best Chinese dinner I have ever had - it is definitely different from the typical American-Chinese food that most people will be familiar with, but it is SO good... My friend, who is Chinese, born and raised in the Szechuan area, even thought that this was similar to what he would have had back home (and he is quite picky!)\n\nI've come at least once a month since discovering this place, and I always order their spicy beef and ox tongue dish - I'd never tried tongue before, and was a little nervous tbh, but it is absolutely delicious!!  It is a little salty, but the sauce is so amazing that I will save it just to eat on rice alone :) \n\nI also love their boiling fish, but not as strongly as the spicy beef.  Honestly, you really can't go wrong with any of their food options - everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious.  Plus, you know it has to be pretty authentic considering that the majority of diners appear to be Chinese students.\n\ntl;dr: if you're craving authentic Chinese food and feeling more adventurous than the typical American version, give Original Cuisine a try!  I'm already planning my next dinner here!
