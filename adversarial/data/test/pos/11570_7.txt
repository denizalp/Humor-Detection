Nice little place, the interior is really nice and fresh,\nBut the food and service is a little disappointing.\nService is okay, the girl was trying her best, bur she's not a \"professional server\" is the best way to put it..\nThe owners were there, older italian gentlemen, they were very loud speaking in italian to the table next to us and other tables, but didn't bother to come jn and check on our table or other tables for that matter, leaving the little girl taking care of the whole floor by herself.\n\nIn terms of food, we ordered the rigatoni pasta with red meat sauce, and the Sausage pizza.\nThe pasta was a bit better, but the pizza wasn't anything that I expected. The flavours simply weren't there!\n\nVivo needs to step up their flavour and service game; otherwise, there are some real good other options within walking distance!\nToo bad, that was my first and would be my last
