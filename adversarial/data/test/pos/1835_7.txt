Ok, so this was the first strip club I've EVER gone into. I was intimated as hell, but I suggested it since our plans to go to a dance club was shot down by the group. The man (Richardo- so he calls himself), who called us a white shuttle to get us there, promised that the ride is free to get there, get back, free admission, but there is a 2 drink minimum (aka $25 a person). Not too bad, since we planned on getting drinks there anyways. \n\nWe make our way there and as we make our way into the dark club, there are just massive amounts of customers and strippers, but it was Friday night. I'm just glad we weren't the only people since that would be super awkward.. the girls had more fun than the guys, at least in my group. The girls working there seemed to give us girls more attention to the guys in our group. I have to admit, it was really fun! I think the strippers didn't really get aggressive on the guys in our group only because a lot of the people in our group were couples. Either way, we had fun.\n\nWe called up Roberto to get our shuttle to pick us up at the end of the night, and he said there was one coming our way but it never came! That was when we got irritated.. we waited so long that we got sick of it and ordered taxi's to come get us. Other than that disappointment, we made a lot of memories that night!
