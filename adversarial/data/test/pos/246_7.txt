Great place to go for a quick lunch and the lunch buffet is only $9.95.  Unlike other Indian restaurants the food you eat here is not that oily and my favorites are the tandoori chicken paired with their delicious Nan bread.  The only reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars is the lack of choices for the buffet but other than that this place is perfect.
