Well I transferred from a school in California to attend UNLV about a year ago. I used to come visit UNLV once every month to visit a friend of mine, and I fell in love with the campus. If you are thinking of attending UNLV, here's a few tips:\n\n- The professors here on campus are generally pretty good, but again it depends on what class you're taking and what department you're a part of. There's a wide range of majors for you to choose at this school, so pick wisely! For example, I came into the school as an elementary education major, but switched after last semester to an Entertainment Engineering and Design major. \n\n-The tuition is cheap, if you aren't from anywhere out-of-state. So far, I've only been able to take 6 credits a semester because of the out-of-state fees. 6 credits = $2,500, once you take even one credit over $6,000 in out-of-state fees is included in your tuition which ends up making even just 7 credits around $8,000. \n\n-If you are a sports fan, the Basketball team, the Runnin' Rebels, have been having a very good past few years. Definitely check them out! Some professors even offer extra credit to attend some of the games.\n\n- I've been working on campus in the IT department for the past year and love it! If you can find a job on campus you'll not only learn a lot of valuable skills and meet a lot of great people!\n\nOverall, my experience at this school has been great so far. Definitely come check out the school if you're looking to attend a school in Nevada.
