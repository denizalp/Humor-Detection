A five star rating might be a bit overly generous for a relatively average sushi joint in Mentor Ohio of all places...but I've never had a bad time at the restaurant or with take out.  Extremely reasonable prices and uniquely created & fantastically good rolls are found here.  This isn't an overly dressed up and expensively decorated trendy sushi spot in Manhattan or Los Angeles...this is pretty damn good sushi for pretty ridiculous prices in Mentor OH! Can't wait to get my hands on a few Scorpion and Kobe Rolls next time I'm in \"Menner\".
