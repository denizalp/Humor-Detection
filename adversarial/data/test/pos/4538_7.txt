THE Charlotte BRUNCH spot -- if you haven't been; you're totally missing out!  I have a lifelong love affair with brunch and buffets but when you sandwich them together; it's a match made in Sunday heaven.  I'm giving 4 stars for:  1. Great ambience; 2. Good service; 3. Good food; 4. Great value overall.  \n\n1.) Great ambience. Georges is tucked away in Piedmont Center in very close proximity to South Park.  It's a French restaurant that has the most idyllic covered patio and is quaint chic inside with its red booths and white linen table cloths.  The buffet is set off to the side of the restaurant in the bar area featuring two hot food aisles, seafood, salad, prime rib, bread, and dessert stations.  You can also order beignets and 5-6 other kitchen made-to-order dishes from a small menu.  \n** Room for improvement.  They place parchment paper over the white linen table cloths.  The two times that we've been, I've noticed that the table cloths were stained.  Ick.  \n\n2.) Good service. The service is exactly on par with what you would expect; not stellar not awful.  Our first server was warm, attentive and super friendly. Our second server served us adequately but we did have to flag him down and ask for certain things twice.  So I'm averaging a great server with a mediocre one.  \n\n3.) Good food.  Having been twice, the food is over all, solid.  Not spectacular but definitely delicious enough for me to want to come back regularly, especially on Sundays.  I've had: \n\n_________ Don't miss it!!\n***  oysters.  They are fresh enough and definitely pass the digestive test (no tummy revolt after the meal).  They're on par with the house oysters at Sea Level or from Pearlz Oyster Bar.  The difference is that you can have as many as you want. \n***  peel and eat shrimp.  They are also fresh, succulent and good sized.  They are on par with Pearlz Oyster Bar but don't have the Old Bay seasoning.  \n***  California salad.  The salad is fresh with goat cheese,  cranberries, nuts and a yummy vinaigrette.  Absolutely surprisingly delicious because buffet salads tend to be wilted. \n***  fresh fruit salad.  The fruit selection was a pleasant surprise.  The pineapple was juicy and sweet  the cantaloupe and honey dew on both occasions were absolutely fresh and superb.  A HUGE departure from buffet fruits.  I would say this is on par with the fruit quality of a St Regis buffet that you pay inordinately more for. \n***  sausage.  The sausage is smoked and infused with woody and a little sweet flavor.  \n***  carrot cake.  Totally bummed that they switched out the divine carrot cake for pumpkin cake because the flavors weren't as decadent.  The cream cheese frosting is the same but the cake itself was disappointing with the switch to pumpkin (btw... I usually LOVE pumpkin anything). \n\n____________pretty good\n***  beignets.  I thought they would be spectacular in the raspberry sauce but they were good, not amazing.  I would have liked them to be a little sweeter in flavor.  \n***  eggs sunny side up.  There's a fancy French name for them and the cheese they put on it is great. \n***  prime rib.  They recently added au jous to the station, which helps with the dryness of the prime rib.  \n***  mac and cheese. Very cheesy but would have liked a little crunchy component to it.  \n***  bacon.  Who doesn't like bacon and how can you possibly go wrong?? \n***  creme brulee.  Solid.  It's a French restaurant,  they couldn't possibly get this wrong... \n\n____________it's there, you paid for it, so why not try it... \n***  French toast.  A little soggy for my taste. \n***  crepes from the made-to-order menu.  Being a French restaurant,  I had high hopes that just fell flat on flavor.  \n***  eggs Benedict.  The hollandiase sauce was very bland. \n***  I tried almost all of the made-to-order dishes on the menu and none of them really struck a chord with me;  they all seemed to be lacking in flavor and complexity.  \n***  desserts.  As with most buffet desserts, everything else was not memorable.  Good enough though.\n\n4.) Great value.  I believe the brunch is $25\/person, which is a great value based on the oysters and shrimp alone (there are also mussels that I didn't try that apparently they're known for).  Add in the made-to-order menu, the great salad and fruit, and a little bit of everything else in between, it's definitely worth it.  If you tried to go to Tupelo's (another Charlotte hot spot that eludes me), you wouldn't get the same value.  This is definitely a place that I am adding to my Charlotte regular dining rotation.\n\nIf you're a brunch lover like me and are seeking Charlotte's best kept secret, this is your go-to place, hands down.
