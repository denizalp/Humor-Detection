A week ago my phone (Samsung Galaxy SIII) looked the movie poster from Unbreakable.  Glass shards started poking my ear when I was on the phone - that's when I knew I had to do something.\n\nFirst stop, Verizon.  A replacement phone (my contract wasn't up) would to cost me $500.  Thankfully, the rep recommended \"a good phone repair place on the East side\", aka Phone Ambulance.\n\nMy experience was quite good: they were very courteous both over the phone and in store.  They told me approximately how many times they had fixed Galaxy phones vs how many issues they had (only a few) and that my phone given the severity of the shatter could end up in the latter.  I understood the risks, left my phone, and four hours later (I paid $10 for the expedited service, normally it's 24 hours) I picked up my like-new phone for just over $100.\n\nI'd go again without question and recommend them to friends.
