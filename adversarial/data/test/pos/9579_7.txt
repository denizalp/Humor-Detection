This is the restaurant right outside and connected to Paris hotel. 7 of us came here for lunch and there was no wait to sit outside in the cute French-inspired patio! Yay! It was great because there were misters to keep us cool in the heat, and we got a great view of the Bellagio water show across the street!\n\nFirst of all, the bread was reallyyyy good. My friends were ooh-ing and mmm-ing over how perfect it was. I'm not too huge of a bread fan but I do admit, they made that warm baguette just right! As for the entree, I tried the grilled salmon and spinach salad which also came with blueberries, walnuts, avocado, and citrus dressing. It was very fresh and delicious! I loved it! I also had a bite of my friend's chicken and brie and green apple sandwich which was also reallyyy yummy! \n\nWe were in a hurry to get to Encore Beach Club by a certain time so we requested super fast service from our waiter, and sure enough, he delivered! Woot! Food came out within 10-15 minutes. Overall, we had a great experience here. I would love to dine here again!
