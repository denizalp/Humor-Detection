This place is now my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe service was great, the presentation of the food was phenomenal, and the food itself was creative and ughp39orielk amazing...\n\nIf I could eat here for the rest of my life I'd be happy.  We wanted to get a little bit of everything, we got the smoked tofu & soba noodle salad (dim sum - but I wish I had more) the sunchoke salad (I didn't even know sunchokes were this good) and the Arctic char (chickpea fritters that accompanied it were spectacular)
