We went to see my moms Aunt Irene today, but before we did, we decided to grab some lunch here at Federal Pizza.  I had signed up for their email club a few weeks ago and one of the perks of joining is a free pizza!  Score!\n\nWhen I first walked through the doors, I thought they weren't going to let me in.  I didn't have any facial hair, tattoos, a cool hair style, nice clothes and the fact that I arrived in a car instead of a fixie bike, exposed me even more.  (If you didn't know already, I'm not the biggest fan of hipsters...anyways...this is home base for them).  The hostess was super nice though and showed me and my mom to a booth in the center of the joint.  I ordered a Coke and we showed our waitress my free pizza email on my phone.  She wrote down some number and that was that.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a meatball sandwich to split.  About 10 minutes later, our food had arrived.  Here is how it was.......................\n\nPepperoni Pizza ($12.00 normally but free with email club signup) -  Simple and delicious.  As per the menu description, \"Molinari Pepperoni + Federal Cheese Blend + Red Sauce\".  The pizza was a little bit \"wet\".  Just a tad soggy in the middle.  You could still pick it up and fold it if you were careful, but it was pretty droopy.  The pepperoni was in large slices and tasted awesome.  I really dug their \"cheese blend\" too.  It was delicious.  Nice and creamy and very flavorful.  The dough\/crust  tasted fine except that it was a little bit too soft for my liking.  It was pretty \"bready\".  Overall it was a good, but not great pizza.  Can't complain about a free pizza though.  Would I come back and buy this pizza?  Probably,  but if I am driving somewhere for pizza, there are a few other places I would head to first.\n\nMeatball Sandwich ($10.00) -  This thing was delicious!  As per the menu description, \"Three Meatballs + House Mozz + Pomodoro + Basil + Wood Roasted Onions\".  I really liked this sandwich.  The meatballs were tender, the sauce was delicious, the cheese was melted nicely and the wood fired onions gave it a great \"bite\".  The bread they use is fantastic too.  Not sure if it is their pizza dough or not but whatever it is, it was great.  It was nice and toasty and held together well.  It was served with a little side salad too.  I didn't touch that because I am allergic to vegetables, but I would definitely get this sandwich again.\n\nService was really friendly.  They weren't around much but they had smiles on their faces and brought me a drink refill without having to ask for it which was cool.    Not sure if I will seek this place out again, but the sandwich was great and the pizza was pretty good.  If I was with some hipster buddies...wait...I don't have any hipster buddies......but if I did, and they wanted to come here, I would probably accompany them and get something to eat.
