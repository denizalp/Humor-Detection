I've been watching this place over the last several months. Decided to try for lunch. \n\nWe got the pulled pork and the brisket sandwiches. I did not try the pulled pork but was told it was good. The brisket was really good. Needed a bit more sauce. Seemed like the sauce for the brisket was more vinegar based. The sauce for the pulled pork was sweet and smokey and tomato based. Got fries but they were a bit over cooked. I like crunchy but these were just really crunchy. I will give them benefit of the doubt that it was a fluke. The sweet potato fries looked good though I did not order. I was told they were good. \n\nService was good. The interior is completely changed from Marcelita's. Looks good. Big bar in the larger room and the old bar area is now just a dining room. 2 garage doors are now on the side. Should be cool patio in the summer. \n\nIt is a bit pricey. Most BBQ is. Nice portion though. I did take half my sandwich home. 2 sandwiches and an ice tea were $30. So bring your cc.
