Stephanie is the most life changing color specialist ever. I think she be a \"hair whisper\" or a \"personal hair trainer\"... Whether I want dark brown, blonde, or a micro trim to keep my hair long she keeps it in the healthiest shape ever. The color is always EXACTLY what I want. Sitting in her chair is a life changing experience. She is my hero!!!!\n\nMy only complaint is that I live in California, and I think she should relocate some where closer to me so I can visit her magical chair more often!
