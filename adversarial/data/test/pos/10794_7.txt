Hospitable, large portions and tasty food. \n\nWe were fleetly ushered to our table. Our server was attentive and came to check on us a few times to make sure that we had our questions answered about menu items. Yet, we did not feel rushed. Our food was brought us, fresh from the kitchen. Our glasses were never empty. Furthermore, when our large Wonton and Spinach Soup arrived, our server dished out our first bowls. Very classy!\n\nNow for the nosh! The Wonton and Spinach soup was sublime, served piping hot, hot enough to perpetuate scalding that leads to throat cancer-hot. The Wonton is smooth and silky, the spinach green and gently wilted plus a broth that is deceptively simple at first, but has a lovely lingering finish.\n\nCrispy Tofu: I made the mistake of ordering this Szechuan style dish without spice. I should've let the chef decide on spicing because the flavors would've been more robust and authentic. Instead, Chef substituted the heat and flavors from hot chili peppers with a stronger garlic and green onion profile, which I loved. The tofu is super crisp on the outside, and soft, silky on the inside. Next time, I am trying it in its full force as Chef intended.\n\nCrispy Fried Pork: OMG, this dish is perfect. Once again, a Szechuan dish. The boneless pork strips were carefully sliced to maximize crispiness. Chef lightly dusted the pork with cornstarch before frying, so there is a crunch, but no large mouthfuls of cottony breading that usually characterizes American Chinese fare. I could've eaten it all night. The saucing was sophisticated. No pools of overly sweet and sour sauce here.\n\nFinally, I thoroughly enjoyed the Beef Hor Fun, tender stir-fried beef with wide rice noodles and vegetables. I was transported back to Hong Kong. All the vegetables were cooked perfectly, slightly past al dente. The colors were bright and so were the flavors. The seasoning on the beef was just right. The beef bites paired perfectly with the soft sauteed noodles. Hmmmm! I want another bite now. \n\nGeorge & Son's Asian Cuisine did not get 5 stars because it is pricey. Also, there were elements of the restaurant that would be nicer with a little updating. The tables and decor seemed worn. Cloth napkins and service was a nice touch, to match, and to make this place a little more upscale, water glasses would've brought the decor up a notch.\n\nIf you are used to tonnes of salt imbued by the egregious dumping of soy sauce, you will be sorely disappointed with by the subtle notes that George & Son's serves up. I am not usually an American Chinese food fan, but George & Son's has won me over. I will be back. This time, bring on the \"la\" or spice.
