My review is for their microblading services only. LENGTHY BUT PLEASE READ!\nI became aware of their eyebrow services from Instagram page. I'm a two time cancer survivor and I have lupus. So lost my brows due to this. I was impressed by the pictures and decided to make an appointment with the specialist Gina Pham for March 16. I was familiar with the procedure after seeing other pictures, videos and extensive research. She took me into the private room, asked me a few questions and I signed the consent forms. The microblading itself was slightly more painful than I imagined. And I bled. Like a lot. I'm not on any blood thinning medicines and I have plenty of tattoos. Anyway, Gina finished my brows. I literally looked like Groucho Marx. They were very wide, and extremely dark. I was shocked and surprised at the same time. I panicked but Gina assured me that they would lighten until my next touch up within 6 weeks. \nAt first I had a mixed reaction because I finally had brows. But mine didn't look anything like the hundreds of other brows I had seen done. Fast forward three days and my brows were literally GRAY. The color was completely GONE. I went back to the salon and showed Gina. She didn't seem concerned and told me that it was\"normal\". I was not satisfied with that response because at this point it didn't look as if I had anything done. My brows were a mess. She then said it would cost me $75 to touch them up and I couldn't understand why. She clearly didn't do a great job and I spoke to the manager. I showed her my brows pics and we compared the rapid decline from just a few days before. Other employees came over to see what I was saying and couldn't believe that I just got them done days before. \nAnyway, they manager said the problem would be remedied and Gina touched up my brows with a brown this time instead of black. The immediate outcome was WAY better than the first. I was very pleased. Even Gina admitted that it looked better and I was right by choosing the brown (that I tried to tell her before). \nI sent Gina a message to schedule my 6 week touch up yesterday. She said it would be $75! Why is she charging me when the signed contract said that I have a touch up included with the initial price I paid! This is ridiculous. I reminded her that she had to correct the first mistake she made and the manager directed her to fix my brows. \nI'm very upset because we have a contract and she doesn't want to honor it. Plus she really messed up my eyebrows and really doesn't seem to care. Her main focus just seems to be is collecting money and boasting about her work when she's only been microblading for a mere few months. Since she is using social media as a platform to showcase a talent, you would think that she would care about the quality of work that is being put out there. My brows are her handiwork and it is sub par. Gina really should focus on consistency, being humble and improving her craft. Money is her only motivation and not Customer service. I will definitely complain and have the correct individuals address my concerns. I am very disappointed and insulted.
