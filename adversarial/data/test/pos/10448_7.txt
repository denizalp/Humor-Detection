Really hate leaving non 5 star reviews, but since my massage left me feeling annoyed, I had to dock off 1 star. I came in with a tight upper back, but no pain, left with a pinched nerve! \n\nWe got a couples massage and my boyfriend's therapist did him painful good wonders! My therapist, however, left me with a pinched nerve and when I tried to explain it to her, the language barrier hindered our communication! I was really disappointed that I felt like she rushed our entire massage by rubbing me quickly up and down from left to right! It didn't feel relaxing at all. Her hands felt like it moved through my body at light speed and I couldn't help but think to myself the entire hour, \"is she actually going to massage me soon? Or is she just feeling my skin quickly\" \n\nNeedless to say, despite that awkward mental hour for me, the spa was zen and all of the employees were sweet as pie! They even treated us with complimentary Valentine's Day cupcakes! \n\nMaybe it was just my therapist, but if I'm going to pay $70(before tip) for an hour massage, I would expect it to be better than your other million Chinatown locations that charge only $30 for a massage that leaves me feeling relieved rather than annoyed. 4 stars for the cleanliness of the spa and my boyfriend's goodhurt massage! I just wish I felt that goodhurt!
