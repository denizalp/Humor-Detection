You know this is a well hidden gem when several uber drivers struggled to pick us up here because they couldn't find it! It's like the Cosmopolitan's basement but an actual hotel attached to the Cosmopolitan! \n\nMy cousin booked a room for 1 night & as told, check in time was at 4pm. We drove from California & got to Vegas at 3am. We thought we'd check in to see if we could check in earlier. Thank you to the lady up front, she was able to find a room to check in by 6:30am. Why not play a little in Vegas to kill time?!\n\n6:30am hits & we happened to have booked just ANY room. How lucky of us to have gotten a penthouse without asking for it!! \n\nPenthouse:\n- 1 bathroom\n- 1 master bedroom with queen bed\n- walk in closet in master bedroom\n- 2 pull out bed\/couches\n- full kitchen with pots, pans, utensils\n- neutrogena amenities\n- 2 flat screen televisions\n- 2 stereos with clock\n\nAll for ONE night between 5 people, we got a really cheap price for this. This is not a high end hotel, but it was clean & decent enough for all of us. Bed was comfortable & the pull out bed was a foam bed. The way it looked, I would say in between a 3 star to a 5 star hotel. \n\nParked inside the Cosmopolitan self parking lot & it takes a couple elevators & walking to get down to the JC. \n\nWe also needed to print out our tickets from the show we were going to & was able to for FREE! They had computers to print it at & pick it up at the front. Don't forget to grab a bag of free popcorn while you're at it!\n\nService here was A-okay, but I give all the credit to the lady at the front desk who let us check in early in a penthouse!
