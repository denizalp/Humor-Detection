This is THE place to get shit done.\n\nDon't go on any of the free floors (1-6) because theres quite a lot of old creepers there that just go there and check out students more than they read their books or newspaper. \n\nWifi can be a little bit shoddy at times but idc, as long as it works. Im not here to game. \nThere seems to be a whole crowd at starbucks 24\/7 seems like theres a group of people who live on this floor and have fun.
