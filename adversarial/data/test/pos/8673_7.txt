One star is too many. I lived here for almost two years. The first year was great. I loved the staff and everything about this place. January of this year, a lot of changes started to be made. All of the wonderful staff that i had come to know were fired and replaced with unfriendly, incapable, and incompetent people. Living here became less and less of a luxury. I have asked the new management for help with several small issues and their response was and still is that they can't help, their hands are tied. The staff couldn't manage their own job descriptions and small tasks. I felt like I was imposing on them. I'm sorry, but who is the resident? They are supposed to be here to help, instead they made living here and other things more of a hassle. Bottle line, I would NEVER recommend this place to live, to rent, to buy. And if you're still living here, I'd suggest moving out. This place and its staff is absolutely horrid.
