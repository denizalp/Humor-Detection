I stopped by Frost randomly on the hot summer day while I was in the area. By coincidence, it was exactly what I was looking for on a above 100 degree day. I've never heard of Frost and as I entered I was so impressed by all of the different flavors with its decorative displays. The staff were all very friendly allowing me to have as many samples as I wanted. This is really nice considering I was having an overload of options. \n\nI was delighted with the smore's and the green tea. As I took my first scoop, the delicious creaminess was so good, it tickled my palate! I've had gelato in Argentina and found this to be just as good if not better! Will definitely be bringing my friends here for nice icy treat in the future!
