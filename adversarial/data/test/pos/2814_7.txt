This place was quite disappointing I have to say. Came in for lunch because I saw the bulgogi sandwich on their menu, but I guess I should have read all the reviews since I found out they stopped serving these a few weeks ago. This is not a brunch, breakfast or lunch place. It's known for their shaved ice dessert so don't come here looking to  fill up on lunch. Anyways, I made that grave mistake but ordered a coconut latte and king dumping anyways. They have interesting latte choices (which btw do not have caffeine in them)...there was sweet potato, red bean, taro and chai latte. The king dumpling was not a dumpling! It was just a single veggie bun which cost $2.50 so don't order it. I may come back here to try the shaved ice but nothing else. So sad.
