There were 5 of us trying Amy's after the movies. I give this restaurant 5 stars for food, staff and all of the healthy selections. I had the Sweet\/Spicy Asian salad with peanut dressing. Perfect. I have never seen that many ingredients in a salad before. Everything blended well. The deserts, to die for. Please try Amy's, you will never be sorry. Outdoor patio was a great place to people watch and larger than most.
