i was having a rough and stressful day.. and very hungry..  i was craving chicken and only place near me..  KFC.. what more is there to write about?? it says it all KFC!  \n\nshould i talk about rude employees? should i talk about how dirty it was? or maybe i should talk about how nasty the food it was?? ummmmm...  \n\nwell.. i was hungry.. and i was not planning to drive.. so i ordered grilled chicken..  okay..\"sigh\".. here is the problem.. i didn't care much about  rude customer service.. place being dirty.. or order took little longer than usual..  but all i wanted was juicy tender grilled chicken with my hot sauce and wash it down with ice cold soda..  am i asking too much here?? can a man take the time and enjoy his life a little?\nnah.. i was asking too much...\n\nchicken was soo dry.. it can pass for beef jerky.. come on now? \nat this point.. i realized and understood.. why some people gone insane and start shooting... i really wanted to throw my chicken at the staff who prep it..  \n\nnow i know why they call it KFC.. killed for chicken!!
