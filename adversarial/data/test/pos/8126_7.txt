Ripped me off. I got the scenic route from McCarran to the Flamingo. +$30 bucks and I was dumb enough to tip him. Suprisingly my return trip to McCarran didn't involve the Freeway, it took half the time and was about $10. My return trip didn't involve Whittlesea\/Henderson either.\n\nDude, if you're going to rip me off, pull out a gun and take all my money. Make it worthwile for both of us.
