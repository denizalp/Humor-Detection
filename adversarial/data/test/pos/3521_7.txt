It's like 90 degrees today with humidity it feels like 9000. I'm thinking sure I should eat something cool and refreshing but nah. Had to get my pho on. I step into the joint. Clean. Lots of white people. In my head I'm like dang... This ain't gonna be legit. But it's hot and I'm already here. \n\nI order my pho. Medium. The waiter doesn't seem to speak great viet. I'm shook. So I test them. I ask for the rare steak on the side. Boom. No problem. I test them some more. I ask for the nuoc beo. That's the secret stuff white people don't know about. Boom. No problem. There's hope Ya'll. \n\nI get the pho all quick snap. The broth looks clear. My heart sinks. This pho too clean! But then I tasted it. Bruh. I knew I was in trouble. It ain't sweet broth. It's got the right flavor. It's got heart. The heart of Vietnam... But cleaner. So I throw in the good stuff and 8.5 minutes later it's done. I devoured it. It's hot. I'm sweating. No ragrets. \n\n10\/10 would do this again.
