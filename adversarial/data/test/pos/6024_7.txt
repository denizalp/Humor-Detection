Its definitely not a partying place with a young crowd, but it is convenient and relaxing. With a view of all the bustling gamblers, its a place to people watch.\nSince my dad paid for the drinks, I didn't mind too muc.... but its pricey. Then again, it is Vegas and on the strip....most lounges are quite expensive. \nLimited vodka selection....I do love my blueberry and soda, but I had to settle for raspberry stoli and soda. \nIf you want a quick drink, its an ok place to go to. If you want a cool ambiance with a youthful crowd, try other lounges...ones that cost admission.
