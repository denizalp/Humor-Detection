Just like mama used to make it. \n\nPaco's customer service reflects the ingenuity and duality of the American spirit, and the working class's tenacity in the face of the ever-changing service industry. \n\nAlso the tacos are great.\n\n\nMy 3 friends and myself walked in, as we do every Tuesday, and were greeted by one of the lovely hostesses who then led us to our usual place in the corner that overlooks the whole seating area. We only had to wait seconds before our drinks were ordered and delivered, and our food was on its way. Per 'Taco Tuesday' tradition, we ordered two tacos each, myself having the soft beef, as well as a fried ice cream each. With a water the bill came to $7.50, which was well worth it.
