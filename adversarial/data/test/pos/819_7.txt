+10 on everything Misti Y said in her review, and I wanted to add that I also ate the Baked Maine Lobster \"Dynamite\" with Spicy Dungeness Crab Stuffing on Valentine's night. INCREDIBLE! The real crab stuffing was the ultimate 'spicy crab' that all versions of 911 rolls aspire to be. Needless to say, I was stuffed myself by the end of the meal. \n\nWe were told that it took 2 months of recipe development to come up with their McDonald's Apple Pie tribute. It was so compellingly crafted and conjured such vivid taste memories that I laughed out loud after the first bite.
