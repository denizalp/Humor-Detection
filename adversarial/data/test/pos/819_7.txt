I would rate them 3.5 but decided to round up since the last couple visits were positive. Inexpensive for lunch and decent selection. Good salad bar, tasty brisket and good vegetables. Lots to try and most of it good. Overly generous ice cream server (is that good or bad?) Wait staff very good, with the grand kids and they are free.
