How ironic that my 200th review is a Terrible 2 star review. \n\nFor sure not what I had planned when wanting to try a new spot for lunch today :(\n\nMy first and last visit I am sad to report Mr. Sandwich, you had one chance with me and you did not satisfy me so I shall continue my affair with Lee.\n\nI tried their grilled pork bahn mi and two shrimp spring rolls. \n\nThe bread was DRY with very little filling inside of the sandwich, where is the pork? Also no extra house mayo was added as I had requested.\n\nThe shrimp spring rolls were good and I enjoyed the sweet dipping sauce that came with them.\n\nWhen my order was ready I asked for Sriracha and the guy handed me a tiny little plastic cup with lid and pointed to a dining table and said, \"you go get from table\". That was odd and not very friendly or the type of service I am used to elsewhere.\n\nI won't be back however at least my curiosity is cured and I gave them a shot!\n\nTotally disappointed :(\n\nLee baby here I come!
