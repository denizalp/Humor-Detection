I went to this dealership and was treated with total disrespect by the general manager.\nWhen I asked to see the window sticker on a particular vehicle, he replied, \"go f..k yourself!\" When I told him I wanted his name so I could write him up on Yelp, he shouted,\n\"my name is suck my d..k!\"\n\nNo wonder there are so many negative reviews of this dealership.  They want your money\nbut show you no respect.  I hope folks will take their business elsewhere because of this.
