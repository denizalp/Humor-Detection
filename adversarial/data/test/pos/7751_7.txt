I'm so happy! After years of enjoying a sit-down experience at Arcadia Farms and months of anticipation for the marketplace doors to open, I can officially say that I am one very happy yelper! \n\nFirst of all, I want to wrap the Arcadia Farms Marketplace up and put it in my pocket; it's so cute inside and out! It's like a dream farmhouse and one I could be quite comfortable in for hours. Maybe it has something to do with the tasty sweets and treats staring me in the face too.\n\nThe marketplace is stocked full of food for all and friendly staff serving it. I always loved visiting the Phoenix Art Museum Arcadia Farms because I'd have a great chat with Lisa G. So, needless to say how pleased I was when I walked into the Marketplace to see her behind the counter! We had a great chat and she told me all about the wonderful items they serve! They have everything from tea packets and flowers to scones, cookies, brownie pops and nutella. They also have their miniature cakes ready for purchase as well as their tasty iced tea and lemonade. The salads are pre-made every morning and waiting in the refrigerator to be eaten. They have tuna nicoise, turkey club, their famous strawberry chicken salad, a garden salad, pasta salad and chicken curry salad with raspberry sauce. They also have a detailed breakfast and sandwich menu that are made-to-order. Besides a couple classics, this menu is different and it's lower in price. The sandwiches range from roast beef and mozzarella and to pressed chicken. They have a lot of options on the menu. I also heard they are introducing a limited dinner menu. It's still not a \"cheap\" meal, but it's competitive to other lunch options out there at about $8-$9 for a sandwich and $8-$9 for a salad. \n\nSo now that I've given a recap of what I saw at the marketplace, I will report on what I ate! It was tough...so tough to decide between a sandwich and salad. I wanted both! Then the more I looked at the chicken curry salad, the more appealing it looked, so I opted for that. Verdict? Very pleased!! The chicken curry has a sweetness to it and then the raspberry dressing is the perfect addition. Arcadia Farm's pesto shrimp salad is addicting and I think that this one might be up there with that level of addiction! It was the perfect size and filled me up without making me want to roll out of there. For my beverage, I went for the raspberry ice tea. And yes, today I decided my sweet tooth would win over my willpower, so I took a lemon cake muffin for the road. In summary, it was a very summeresque meal and very fulfilling! I sat outside at their tables in the front. I wish they had indoor seating but it seems like the indoor seating is only for the private event catering. But then again, this is a marketplace and the purpose is for people to get in and out. \n\nSpeaking of the private catering room, it is absolutely adorable in there. Arcadia Farms is the perfect place for a bridal or baby shower or ladies lunch, but the restaurant itself can be a little cramped so it makes it hard. Therefore, this is a great alternative! If I ever need to plan a ladies-only party, hands-down this will be my first choice. \n\nIn summary, I definitely see myself becoming a regular at the Arcadia Farm's Marketplace. I still love the sit-down Arcadia Farms, but when I don't have time to sit down and have a ladies lunch, I'm very happy that they've given me this alternative!!
