I wish I could give them zero stars. This is the absolute worst shop we have ever gone too. All the mechanics are idiots. I went in for an oil change and came out with $3200 in damage. I took my car there for an oil change, left the shop and two days later we hear something drop out of the engine and thud on the ground. We then saw a lot of oil leaking out. We were right near the shop and decided to take it there. They offered to \"fix\" it for a case of beer, they said the oil filter was punctured they probably left a tool in my car. After starting it we heard this loud noise almost like a card being held on fan blades. The \"mechanic\" told my BF it was just a piece of plastic from the undercarriage that was making that noise. The noise started getting worse as days went on and then we took it back now a 3rd time and the idiot tells us there might be a manufacture error with the oil filter and to take it to Mazda. I then take it to Mazda and pay $150 to get it diagnosed and they tell me my engine is damaged because of the oil leak and that Midas probably covered it up by saying they would fix it for free. All they did is damage my engine and could not even diagnose that after going there twice!!! I will be taking them to small a claims court and posting on any review and social media site about their horrible auto shop. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!!!
