New restaurant in hottest area. \nNice Italian d√©cor , wall very nice with pictures famous Italian actors .\nExpectations are high from us, everything makes us think that we would have had an experience wholly unique and very Italian. Unfortunately we find ourselves in front of the classic American restaurant with Italian sign outside.\nWhy guys using  italian name if is American ? to attract customers ?\nanyway We start with cavatelli pasta and of course I expect of fresh homemade pasta but unfortunately it was packed, precooked, taste was not bad but homemade pasta has an added value AND my son ordered a pizza with seafood Well what about to forget as soon as possible.\nBland tomato with some seafood topping and cherry tomatoes. the dough was hard without weaving 17$ and 21$ cavatelli , appetizer of polenta and two glasses of wine and the bill comes up over $ 100 with tips. Definitely expensive considering that after all we did not eat meat. Casual restaurant NO, Italian restaurant NEITHER.\n I'm from New Jersey and I know Italian food very well.
