I happened to just come upon this bakery!\nLocated in a little building that was once a Doctor Office from the 40's\/\nThat alone I found to be very cool.\nButtermilk Pie!   OMG... I have never tried anything like this.\nThe girl working gave me a sample with a caramel sauce on top.\nIt was truly fantastic.\nSo I got 2 slices to go. The good thing you do not have to buy an entire pie. Though you can if you would like to.\nOh yes, we all loved it. She put the caramel sauce on the side in a container.\n\nI also bought some little Peanut Butter Dog treats with no chemicals or anything else in it. All natural. Our little dog loved them. She tap dances around till she gets one.\nIt is a great place, with some wonderful baked items.\nThey make some wonderful cakes and other items.  What a great local place.
