Nice clean rooms & friendly staff. Long check-in & check out lines. Retarded fees (yeah, everybody is doing it, so it must be alright). \n\nSome of these newer hotels are built on a strict budget and lack quality, and it shows. I suppose, they've concluded that a new hotel is hawt for 5-10 years till something nicer and flashier comes along. So, they don't make them to last. Why do I care? I don't; I just can't help noticing these details. \n\nIn terms of entertainment, this place lacks, so you have to travel to other hotels. If you are doing that, you might as well stay at those other hotels.
