I have been here multiple times and every time I go, the service is just awesome. It is consistent - the staff is uber friendly and they make sure that you are having the best time possible each and every time. \n\nThe hookahs are good and they consistently replace the coals with hotter ones and are asking you if its ok - if its too harsh or if its still good. There was this one time my friend had undercooked chicken and they apologized repeatedly and brought out free shots for everyone at the table. This is another cool thing about this place - they randomly bring out free shots for everyone if you are there long enough. The drinks are also very cheap so if youre looking for a place to pregame before a night out on the town. Shots are cheaper than beers haha The mixed drinks such as a crown and coke or jameson and ginger ale are always really strong. \n\nThis place has really good food as well. They have falafel balls that are really scrumptious. \n\nAll in all, whether you want to pregame before you paint the night red or just want to chill, this would be a good choice.\n\nThe waiters are REALLY nice and friendly. Never once have I NOT gotten a smile.
