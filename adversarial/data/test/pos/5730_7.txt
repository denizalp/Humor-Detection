Over 1200 reviews of this place. I can add nothing new or noteworthy other than my brief two cents worth. What can two pennies get you? How about this...\n\nIt's not cheap. $$$$ means \"expensive\" so don't freak out about a $16 cocktail or $59 a la carte steak. \n\nService is exceptional from the front desk staff to the bartender to the waitresses and the service staff. When six people come into your private dining room to individually serve the side dishes...that's pretty cool. \n\nDelicious drinks, hot and cold appetizers, steaks, sides and dessert. Our valuable clients, coworkers and vendors had a marvelous time.
