I remember going to hot dog on a stick at the meadows mall when I was like 13 and it was goooood. I remember the goofy uniforms the employees had to wear and laughing when I saw someone I knew who worked there =p. \n\nI was hungry after work but didn't want something heavy. I remembered hearing this place had opened up and had a drive thru! It isn't too far from work so I headed over. I missed the place the first time around. You have to turn into the shopping center with the stop light to get into the parking lot otherwise you can't get to the restaurant. Eventually after turning down a side street and turning again I was back on Charleston and turned into the plaza. I made it! \n\nI ordered a beef hot dog on a stick and a pepper jack cheese on a stick. It was almost $7 for the 2 items. I don't normally buy corn dogs so I don't know if the price is good, but $3 something for a corn dog seems a bit high to me. It took a few minutes to prepare my food but when I bit into the corn dog it was warm. Same thing with the cheese. I expected hot gooey and cheesy but it was just warm. Even the batter on the outside wasn't crunchy. I was disappointed. The food was good, but I was expecting more. Maybe I went on an off night? Maybe that is the normal temp of their foods? I know they are supposed to batter and cook everything fresh to order so I don't really know what the deal was. I probably will try them again if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.
