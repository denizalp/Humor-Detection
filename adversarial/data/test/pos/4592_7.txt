For around the same price of a resort fee in a high end casino, \"Hitzville\" is a deal. And when you add in a Tix 4 Tonight discount, it is an even more solid deal. During our last stay cation it was a solid deal that my family and I took advantage of.\n\nMy dad and I are music lovers that are fans of the Motown classics that \"My Girl\", \"Stop in the Name of Love,\" \"ABC,\" \"Heatwave,\" \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine,\" and countless classics. \"Hitzville\" seemed like the perfect choice to dance to the Motown classics.\n\n\"Hitzville\" is a spin on Hitsville the original Motown Headquarters and current Motown Museum. 2043 miles southwest of Hitsville is the V Theater in the back of the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. This is where  \"Hitzville\" performs a 75 minute show most days of the week at 5:30 pm.\n\nWe found out about \"Hitzville\" in Tix 4 Tonight. Each ticket saved us about the price of parking at the MGM Grand for a night. The way it works with Tix 4 Tonight is that you have to bring the stub to the V Theater anytime before the show. When we arrived at the V Theater, the agent gave us our assigned seats. From that point, we would return to the V Theater a few hours later.\n\nUpon arriving at the V Theater for the 5:30 performance, it was unclear what line to wait on. Fortunately we picked the right line. The nice thing about the V Theater is that it is the secondary theater of the Planet Hollywood Theater. One of the things that made it nice is that there wasn't a metal detector where you have to empty your pockets and bags. I think this made the line flow better. At the end of the line, an Usher walked us to our seats in the back of the theater.\n\nFrom the upper seats that were not the most comfortable, I took in 75 minutes of rock n roll led by the Producer and star of the show Jin Jin Reeves and her talented costars. Jin Jin Reeves transformed into Tina Turner, Diana Ross, and Gladys Knights during different parts of the show. She had the mannerisms down to a T. The men performers transformed into the Temptations, the Ojays, Miracles, Four Tops, and other stars. They had the harmonies down to a T. The highlight of the show was when Jin Jin Reeves in her Diana Ross transformation brought a volunteer from the audience then led him to a chair while singing to him. Concurrent to the 75 minutes of performing, there was a screen showing the original group. \n\n  In my opinion, the major flaw of the show was that some of the songs, about forty percent were not Motown. Tina Turner, the Ojays, and Gladys Knight were not Motown Artists. This show is \"Hitzville The Show-The Motown Review!?\" Being a Motown fan, I'd prefer seeing more Motown songs. Maybe include Stevie Wonder, The Commodores, or the Jackson 5. And a minor flaw was that they cut off The Temptations \"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\" at the best part. \n\n  Leaving the show was a cluster cocktail. The exit line has a disfunction layout where the performers are selling their DVDs and CDs where people are trying to leave. This delayed us enough for my dad to joke,\" Wouldn't be funny if you couldn't leave unless you buy a CD.\" \n\n In comparison to the other Las Vegas shows that I have seen \"Hitzville\" is a good show going for a good price. However, in my opinion there are better Las Vegas shows that I have seen including \"The Australian Bee Gees\" ,\" Raiding the Rock Vault,\" \"Purple Reign,\" \"Love,\" and \"Mystere\".
