This was my first stay at the Tropicana and according to my man, also the last. I was told that the Tropicana was once a dump that has now been newly remodeled. Well there are three things that I think they still need to remodel.\n\n1. I didn't like the smell of the hotel. It was something vanilla based that just kinda turned my stomach.\n\n2. Our shower was shit. It took 7 minutes for the water to get warm enough for me to get in. As soon as I got in the shower, the water turned cold again within five minutes. Also, the shower head really needed to be replaced. There was barely any water coming out. The drain also must have been clogged because the water began to form a small pond at my feet and there was some sort of permanent stain on the shower floor. My man took a shower this morning and got no hot water at all.\n\n3. I don't gamble, but the casino was small and mediocre, lacked the excitement that some of the others have and seemed slow moving.\n\nI would say that I'd come again, but babe vetoed that.
