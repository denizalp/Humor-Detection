This place I found to be outdated and unappetizing. The strange breadsticks were unpleasant, and they don't have regular bread (?). The service was in-your-face and obnoxious, though responsive. The food was average at best. Lastly, for the price, I'd be much happier at Alexander's, or even Bravo!. It's not an awful experience but, unless you live in Avalon, save yourself the trip and try one of Pittsburgh's other excellent Italian restaurants!
