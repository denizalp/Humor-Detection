I am not happy with this business.  We received a new dog and found out she was 10 months old and had not received any shots or veterinarian care. So we took him right away to get his vaccination shots but they said be careful the first couple of weeks who he is around (for his safety as he was healthy!). He needed grooming so we called several groomers and asked if they accepted dogs without shot records.  (where we lived before most will not accept dogs w\/o updated shot records). To my surprise several that I called said yes that is normal!  I talked to Betsy and I believe her husband or manager and asked them both if they cared for shelter dogs, as I of course did not want him around any dogs who had not been vaccinated.  They said no,  so I made his appointment.  When I picked him up there was a man from a 'No Kill' shelter dropping off a dog.  I said, I asked you and your wife if you took shelter dogs,  you said you did NOT take shelter dogs....... !!!! His answer was ...Well your dog is in the check-out room so he never passed or came in contact with the other dog!!!!!!!........... I said well then you flat out lied to me because I specifically asked several times if you accepted shelter dogs here and you said NO!!  I cannot believe the owner of this company would put his clients dogs in danger without making it clear as to what kind of business practices they follow!!!  I would not have taken the chance and taken my dog here if they had been honest. .................Really, .NO, actually we had  full conversation and I did not even think she was Hispanic, I though maybe arab or ????
