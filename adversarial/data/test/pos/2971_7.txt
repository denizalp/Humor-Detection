This club is definitely beautiful. The location is not easy to find. Plus its not a mega club with 3000 seats. There's plenty of seats. It's very intimate. I went there for a job interview actually. I scoped the place out before and it was pretty dead. Doesn't really bump till about 10pm.  The bar there is very nice with great selections. Upstairs has another beautiful bar. Plus there's private rooms that are very intimate, each one is different. It's almost like a club setup. The DJs pretty cool. The bar staff is very friendly. The girls here....well I watched this one...Kennedy who was a headliner. The stomach and leg control for pole tricks were the best I've ever seen. EVER! FOR E VERRRRR! Yea She can give Cirque people a run for their money. It was A MAZ ING! I wasn't sure if she was a snake, or monkey, but she....yea WOW. I was too nervous to get a lapdance due to injuries I thought I would sustain. But over all there were about 4-5 girls I would have gotten dances with. Drink specials go on. Sundays I think it's beers and Jack and Cokes for 3 bucks.\nCurrently they don't have a lot of traffic. We went to Live Band Night which is Sundays. I think it has a LOT of potential. Not too many girls. But I bet if I didn't have ten people with me, that we would get more action ;) I would go to Minxx again. Regardless if I get a job there or not. BTW If I bartend there, you better come see me.Yes they did have a bad rap with Pacman Jones shooting.  But the reality is - there's shootings anywhere. This just happened to be someone famous. Give it to October. I'll bet this place will be bumpin. \nHaha I bought my friend Billy a dance from this tattooed girl named Flower. She was really sweet. He was scared. Kinda like Home Alone 2 scared....Her boobies were gonna hurt him. There was fear in that boy's eyes....
