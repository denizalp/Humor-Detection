First of all, I love the food, Second, the customer service is impeccable at this location. I have been coming to this Denny's for years and I always have a great experience.\n\nI would like to give thanks to my loyal server 'Jennifer' and the chef who always makes my 'secret burrito' (not on the menu). \n\nI am always happily stuffed and satisfied after my meal\n\nThank you again Denny's for your 5 STAR service!!
