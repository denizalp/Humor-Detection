Walked past here hundreds of times so I decided to try it out one day. I got the classic salmon poke bowl and I was a bit disappointed. They only had 1 size and the bowl didn't fill me afterwards. I found that it had way too many toppings and it gave away from the actual poke. For the price I paid for the bowl, which read nearly $15, I did not find it worth it I'm an avid poke guys fan and after trying this out, I'd rather stick with PG. As for service, it was really good and they were patient since my friend and I were staring at the menu for quite a while haha. Wish there were more seating besides the windowstill.
