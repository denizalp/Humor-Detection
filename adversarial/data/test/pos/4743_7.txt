I have been here about 3 times in one month, but I never complained until now. My friends and I went there earlier in the day to have dinner, but when we were waiting for a table, there were about five hostess' waiting there and doing nothing. After about 5 mins we finally got seated. They knew we were there, but did nothing.\n\nOther than that small incident, food is incredible! Id have to say the ribeye steak, macaroni and cheese are some of my many favorites. I've also tried a couple salads which were yummy as well!!
