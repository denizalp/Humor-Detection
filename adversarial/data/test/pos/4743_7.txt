Ohhhhhh Razzy Fresh you've met your match!!  \n\nMaybe it's because I can't actually stand in front of the machines like I do at Razzy Fresh and decide against the fattening Cake Batter yogurt.  Four choices written on a dry erase board.  \n\nThe only one my eyes went to was NY Cheesecake.  Of course!  It's like picking the most expensive thing on the menu....except this time it's the worst for you.  \n\nBut gosh darnit, it was GOOOOOD!  I'm hooked!  Pile on the brownie bits and sprinkles and I'm in.  That's how I roll, healthy yogurt turned bad but oh so good!
