4 months since it's opened and I couldn't be happier.\n\nLocated at the old fresh and easy building on the same corner as the Walgreens on Farm and Durango, this Lee's has an abundance of parking. \n\nSo if you've read my reviews, you've seen my total wine review. Since then I've been going to Lee's and had nothing but great customer service. Was awesome to be able to meet Lee himself on the soft opening where he demonstrated a level of professionalism in customer service that I would have expected from a larger retail company, *cough total wine cough* \n\nGuess what, even after 4 months since their opening, all the employees I have run into and met since day one, all provide the same courtesy Lee showed. Together with a clean and clear store with a friendly environment,  you get an all around overall 10 of 10 of shopping experiences.\n\nGranted they do have a smaller beer selection than the other place, but hey, find one and stick with it, just like my new favorite liquor store. Thank you guys for a good job.
