GREAT music and tons of fun! LOVE the music!! Fridays is mainly for \"cheros\" aka\nguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Not\nreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop,\nreggaeton, and house music which is the main day it gets POPIN!  After 2 it turns 18\nand over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. \nNOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind of\nplace.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot more\neye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle its\nmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impress\nanyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.\nBathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about the\nbathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.  \nPrices: People say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap... if your\nhard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute Latino will buy your drinks for u duh!
