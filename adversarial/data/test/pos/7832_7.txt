I would give this place a better rating if the clown who works there did not try accusing me of trying to get over on them. I attended the Brightblack Morning Light show alone. It was a work night. I drank a few Two Hearted Ales and was stone cold sober. After the show I asked to close out my tab. He charged me for a Paulaner and a Dortmunder that I did not drink. I kindly explained that I have been exclusively drinking Two Hearted Ales. He insisted that I was lying. I said \"Who would I buy them for? I am by myself\" and he replied \"Are you calling me a liar?\". I confirmed that I was in fact calling him a liar in retalliation for him calling me out with his out of line fabricated story. He got really heroic and raised his voice. I got mad and spoke my opinion on him as a person. He said that I should finish my beer and leave, so I did him one better, did not finish my beer, left a 66% tip and walked out cursing. The other bartender knew the dude was full of it and I could tell he felt awful about the whole experience. I have heard that this dark haired bartender guy is always screwing up orders and acting like a complete dork. He does not need to be serving drinks to the public. He should be working a job like Milton in Office Space in a dark basement doing nothing. His social skills are non existent. Unfortunately this is the best venue in Cleveland with the best acts consistently booked here. I will continue to attend events here and I avoid that guy at all costs. Other than that the place is great and I really enjoy it every time that I go there.
