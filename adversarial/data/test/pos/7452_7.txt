Did you know it's a $1,000 fine in Clark County to feed the homeless on the street, if you're just some random citizen? Thank God for Las Vegas Rescue Mission, the homeless shelter in Las Vegas. \n\n(I am actually a volunteer here so I don't get paid - I choose to spend my time here, so hopefully it's okay to write a review!) \n\nI found out about the LVRM via meetup.com and I have to say I am so glad I did. The people at the rescue are doing a great service for the vast, ever-expanding homeless population here in Vegas. \n\nI must say that I do get choked up when I volunteer during the hygiene kit and snack pack hand outs. It's heartbreaking when a family or a single girl with a baby comes down the line, in need of a blanket for her infant, especially because it's still freezing at night in Vegas. The people that are served, even though they're going through hard times, are for the most part very personable and grateful, and a blessing to work with. \n\nThe mission does so much more than housing people for a night and giving them a meal; they do everything from job placement and training, to a clothing ministry, psychological services, recovery services, and Christian outreach. \n\nThe people who work within the kitchen live at the mission and it's a part of the terms of their recovery and reentry into society. They work, give up drugs and\/or prostitution, in exchange they get to live at the mission for a specific period of time and get job training and placement. \n\nThis place is doing great things for the community and is a valuable asset.
