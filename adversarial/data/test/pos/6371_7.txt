SAKE BOMB!\n\nImadake is good food, fun especially with friends. \n\nHung out there for the first time with a bunch of friend and well came away with the same experience. \n\nThe food was fresh and well priced. \n\nThe drinks were yummy and the on tap Sapporo was super refreshing. \n\nNext time I go I'm trying the ramen it looked awesome as it passed me by. \n\nOverall Imadake was full of life and good japanese eats. \n\nCan't wait to go again! \n\nPro Tip: If you are there with a group of friend get a round of sake shots . Shake bombs to be specific... you will be pleased!
