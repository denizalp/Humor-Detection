This place has turned into Lifetime NURSERY AND DAYCARE. They don't care about member needs and seem to only want to cater to the needs of children and parents who want daycare services. This place should be an awesome fitness center - not a place to drop off kids for week(s) long camps that ruin the scene for everybody else. Want to use the basketball court? Too bad - it's reserved for kids. Want to use the racquetball courts? Too bad - they're being torn out for kids. The kids already have 5000 sq. feet of space in their own area!! Get your act together LTF!! Be a fitness center - not a DAYCARE!
