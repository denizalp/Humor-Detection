I had been wanting to come back to North Italia after a Yelp Event I attended last year. I finally got the chance last week. I could not have been more pleased with my experience. \n\nFirst, I just love the look and feel of this place. Hidden behind a large group of trees is hidden this gorgeous, tall, modern, metal and wooden building. You first see their large wrap around Bar top. My favorite. You can sit either inside at the bar top of out side with the patio behind you. There is plenty of seating in the dinning area as well. The open concept has a welcoming feel. Even the kitchen is open for the public to come watch them create magic. \n\nMy husband and I sat at the bar top as we usually do. The service was crazy friendly, helpful, and giving. We ended up with a free appetizer, dessert, and coffee after all was said and done. They just want you to enjoy your time there, get stuffed, and try everything. To start we ordered CRISPY CALAMARI: ($12) Arugula & grilled lemon vinaigrette. Such complementary flavors. I highly recommend this to start with. Our server also got us the ZUCCA CHIPS ($7) when I asked him what it was. He just said \"Hold on, let me show you.\" These were very thinly sliced zucchini chips, lightly battered and fried. This would be perfect to start with if you are looking for something to not fill you up before our dinner. They were like tiny potato chips, and equally addicting. For our main entree's we shared both the SHORT RIB RADIATORI ($20) parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, herbed breadcrumb. So creamy and rich. The bread crumbs were the perfect touch to the dish because it was so rich. It helped soak up some of the rich cream. The Braised pork paired nicely with its sweet flavor. We also had the PROSCIUTTO PIZZA  ($14) mission fig, goat cheese and arugula. I mean... you cant go wrong with Fig's and goat cheese. For dessert we couldn't decided between the 2 so when we asked the server what he preferred he told us he would bring out the one he liked best. He brought us both. They were just too sweet to us. He asked me if I wanted a coffee, I said I would love a cappuccino that he also gave us. I wish I caught his name. Anyway... we had the SALTED\nCARAMEL BUDINO ($7) crème fraiche, maldon sea salt. Like a Salted Carmel Crème Brulee it was perfect. And Lastly the BOMBOLINI ($6) (italian donuts) meyer lemon curd,vanilla mascarpone. They were warm and melted in your mouth. \n\nI really cant say one bad word about this place. I'm not sure if I can go back. I don't think anything will top our first experience here. But the food was so dang good... I'm going to have to come back.
