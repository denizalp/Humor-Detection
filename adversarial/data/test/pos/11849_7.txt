Got take-out, Short-rib stroganoff and Banh-mi.  \n\nThe new decor is an improvement in the restaurant area which was pretty gross, or at least old-school wisconsin, before.  The bar seems a bit more roomy but was not more enjoyable, seems kinda dark.\n\nThe food was very Food Fight: bland and inoffensive pile of stuff that did not taste very fresh.  I can't say it was bad, but it was not up to the quality of many of the restaurants on the east side and did not justify the price.\n\nWife says: the bread for the banh-mi was inappropriate.  I think that means it hit on her.\n\nI'll give it another try or two and check out the bar because it's a block from my house, but not real optimistic.
