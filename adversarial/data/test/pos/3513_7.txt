So, this Marco's just opened near my house (maybe a month or two ago) and we have been here about 3 times since.  This Marco's is really small (2 tables inside, 4 seats total) and should be used either for takeout, or delivery.  It would be really weird and awkward if you dined in here (even though it is possible).  We have gotten 3 pepperoni pizzas and here are my observations and recommendations...............\n\n1.  Get your pizza \"well done\".  Marco's is a tad greasy (not in a bad way), and when cooked \"regular\", it seems even more greasy than it actually is.  When you get it cooked \"well done\" it browns the cheese a bit, and seems \"less greasy\".  \n2.  Order online and click on \"Hot Deals\" on the left hand side of the screen.  That will show you all of their specials, and automatically apply the coupon during checkout.\n3.  I mentioned we got pepperoni pizzas all 3 times.  The first time, we got an extra large pepperoni pizza.  It was just alright.  The last 2 times, we went with large \"Pepperoni Magnifico\" pizzas.  Go with the Magnifico.  It comes with 2 types of pepperonis (regular and small ones that curl up nice and crispy), and a garlic butter\/parmesan crust.  It tastes way better than the plain pepperoni pizza, and those little pepperonis are absolutely delicious!  This will be our go to order going forward.  Lot's of cheese, good tasting sauce and a medium\/thick crust.  Pretty tasty pizza!\n4.  Service is fine.  Bunch of young kids working at the shop, but they are friendly enough.\n\nOur go to pizza used to be Barro's.  Marco's has since replaced them.  Same price (possibly cheaper with coupons), similar style and texture, but Marco's tastes better and I haven't gotten sick from them (happened a few times at Barro's).  It's definitely not in my \"top 10 pizzas\" or anything like that, but for a local chain, with good prices and good tasting pizza, it is fine by me!  We will continue to come back as long as they are around.
