Didn't have my phone earlier to check in here. This place  is very clean and simple  and I love the design. The sizes come in the \" perfect for one \" regular size , the i love milk tea and boba huge size and the i can share with the whole family size.  which makes it easy to sahre and since I always hog the boba when I share with my boyfriend. I didn't have anyone to share with today and I got a 24 oz and it was way too much for me. My eyes were way bigger than my stomach. It had a good taste tho. Not like other bobas where u can't taste the flavor. Best of all u get a stamp card. Not good for my waist but I crave boba when I want it this is where I will come.
