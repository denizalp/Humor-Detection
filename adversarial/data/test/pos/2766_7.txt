Visited for lunch today, my first time at G's.  Since I already checked out the menus online, I was ready with the first of many questions regarding my numerous food allergies to ask my server as soon as he walked up to my table- Yes, I'll have iced water, please.  Oh, and could you find out if your bbq sauce contains ...?  (Some don't, you know.)  Next thing I knew, Liz the manager was at my side.  After mentally jotting down which of the \"major\" allergens I was most worried about, she disappeared into the kitchen to do some research: are the sauces safe?  is the cod fresh or frozen, and is the batter *-free?  the fish is def. not frozen, but she'll check re * ingredients... are the breads made in-house?  (home-made reduces the chance of * usage.)    and the verdicts?  lay off all the sauces, just to be sure; not sure on the batter, so stay away.  breads are made locally, and she didn't have any ingredients info.  and with all of that data, i pretty much had most of the menu items crossed off (sandwiches\/burgers that contained buns and sauces, entrees that used sauces (award-winning ribs, entrees adorned with sauces,  marinated meats, etc.), fried fish, anything battered.  this left the wraps (well, those that did not use *, sauces, etc.) and the sweet potato fries.\n\nAh, the SPF!  What was I thinking, laying off of the raspberry mayo for the first half?  This sauce brought the greatness of the fries to a new crescendo.  I REALLY love crispy\/crunchy textures (probably due to my compulsion to be healthy and stay away from deep-fried anything most of the time.  Plus, grease-flavored foods really don't rock my boat.  Oh, but these SPF's with the razz mayo were really good.  \n\nThe meat wrap, $7.95.  With beef tenderloin, $8.95.  Comes with choice of side.  Other sides not listed may require an upcharge- most likely with my SPF.  My beef wrap looked quite appetizing- thin slices of beef tenderloin with SW rice and shredded cheese wrapped in a chipotle tortilla, with shredded salad mix and salsa with sour cream drizzle on the side.  Took a bite.  Mmm... very tasty, but wha?  Is that * in the SW rice?!?!  For the rest of the meal, I was picking * off.  What I really should've done was return the wrap and get one sans rice, since the * juice would be all over the rice.  But the first one took so long to reach my table- I had eaten all but five sticks of the fries- that the option didn't even enter my thoughts.  The fries cost an extra $3 bec. I was served the app portion.  Whatever.  I'm also thinking that the chipotle wrap had * in it.  (I was in pain for the rest of the day, and still am, twelve hours later.)  Yes, I was disappointed, but I can't say all of those minutes chatting with the manager were for naught.  I just wished she and especially the staff were more knowledgeable of all of their dishes and sides.\n\nI'll return for the sweet potato fries and razz mayo.  And maybe a delectable icy beverage.  Anyone know how the margaritas, pina coladas (haven't had one of those in years!), and daquiris are here??  \n\nInside atmosphere (standard booths and rectangular bar tables and chairs with TVs everywhere you look up- like a cafeteria) is a striking contrast to the lazy Sunday, who-knows-who's-coming-to-dinner vibe (bossa nova music was playing in the background) I felt outside as I walked past to get indoors.  One problem- I just can't stand inhaling cigarette smoke while I'm eating.  I can't stand inhaling tobacco smoke anywhere, anytime, actually.  I hope I didn't offend anyone just now... For some people it may be flatus or body odor that offends them; for me, it's smoke.  Unless it's a clove.  Love that spicy scent.  (Body odor offends me, too.  But I digress...)\n\nAnyhoo, for all you sweet potato fry lovers out there, try them here.  You'll thank me later.
