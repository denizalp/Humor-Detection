Oh ma gaw. Just had one of the best meals I've ever had at Mamakas.\n\nFull disclosure: I didn't pay for anything\/don't even know how much our meal cost, so this review is strictly about food and service... Which were so flawless that Beyonce would have to change her song to \"Somewhat Flawed, Actually.\"\n\nOur server recommended the Fix Hellas for me, as I like lighter beers, and it was perfect. My family raved about their cocktails.\n\nMy family and I had a six?-course prix fixe meal:\n\n1. Pita + four dips\n2. Cured swordfish + spanakopita\n3. Tomato\/feta\/cucumber salad\n4. Grilled lambchops with couscous salad + garlic fries\n5. Grilled octopus over a fava bean sauce\n6. Baklava + ice cream\n\nThe lamb was so goddamn juicy and delicious. The tomato\/feta\/cucumber salad was another favourite. There was enough food to feed a TDSB classroom, but we managed to finish most of it.\n\nService was really good... Our server was knowledgeable, charming, and generally on POINT. There was also what sounded like Greek house music playing in the restaurant, which made for good (but loud-ish) vibes. Walls are all white, giving it that Santorini feel.\n\nSo, so good though.
