Went 8-28-15 around 2:20 PM.  This store is located in a shopping center on the northeast corner of the intersection of Rancho and Washington.  My friend Maria was craving this thing called a Chamango and it had me intrigued so I yelped it and found this place. \n\nWhen I pulled into the shopping center I almost turned around and left cuz' this is a sketchy area, folks.  All the shops have bars on the windows and doors & plenty of unsavory characters hanging around.  \n\nI pulled in and went inside, a bit nervous because I'm such a white girl.  The inside is surprisingly extremely clean and organized, and much larger than I thought from the outside.  Like yelper Mari L. said, they have just about every Mexican goody you could ever want.  Popsicles, smoothies, juices, slushies, ice cream, candies, nachos, weird cucumber things, you name it! Also they have water bottle filling stations there.  In the back behind the counter there are huge tanks of water and what seems to be a water filtering apparatus.  \n\nThe ladies working there were incredibly nice and patient with my gringa questions.  $16.50 got me three Chamangos.  Okay, so, a chamango is basically like a mango slushy with real fresh mangoes in it, and a mexican hot sauce called chamoy.  I asked for no chamoy since I wasn't sure what it tasted like.  I think the best part is it comes with this straw with chile\/tamarind chewy candy wrapped around it.  You have a little slushy, then nibble on the straw and the combination is amazing.  Loved it.  I'll be back.
