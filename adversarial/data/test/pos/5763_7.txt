In general, I don't go out to clubs all that often.  Pay money to get into a room that is way too packed and too loud that it needs to be?  Pass.  But in Vegas, it's almost a given that we have to go...so at least with Tao, it didn't cost as much as it could have!  \n\nIn order to avoid eating somewhere and then coming back to a line, we ended up eating at Tao.  Beyond the convenience, it saved quite a bit of money too - rather than wait in line, you can go straight up to the club after exiting and then immediately re-entering so that they can check ID's.  No line and no cover for our party of 12?  Not too bad.\n\nThe meal wasn't anything spectacular - okay, but pricey.  However, since paying for the meal was essentially the cover, it kinda made up for it in a way though.  Kinda.  I wanted to load up on some carbs drinking and ordered the Lobster and Kimchi fried rice along with the Angry Dragon Roll.  Pretty boring, I know.  Overall, the food was pretty lackluster, especially given the price.  The roll tasted fine, but it was like what you could find at just about any decent Japanese restaurant.  I thought the fried rice was lacking in lobster meat and  flavor, but the kimchi satisfied my craving for Korean food (could have been a bit more potent and spicy though).\n\nAs for the club, it takes up a lot of space, but it wasn't exactly spacious.  The decor is nice and they have go-go \"dancers\" around to liven up the place.  In the apparent main room though, the VIP section is almost right in the center of everything, so navigating around was difficult with all of the people.  At least they had a couple of bars going so that we didn't ever have to walk too far.  As more people started filing in though, we ended up going upstairs and spending the rest of our night outside by Tao Beach.  Despite being a hot summer night, it was still cooler outside than it was inside.\n\nNo huge problems with Tao, but having gone to XS on our second trip (Tao was on the first), I'd rather go back there or check out somewhere new than hit Tao again.
