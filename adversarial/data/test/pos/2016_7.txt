Insomnia is located on the 2nd floor of the Epicenter. This location is very similar to the other Insomnia located in other cities (Miami, Atlanta..). It's small and quaint, perfect for just a grab and go cookie or ice cream. The menu is displayed in the wall with all the prices, types of cookies, and any special deals if you are buying more than one cookie. The cookies and ice cream are reasonably priced and tasted really great. All cookies and ice cream are displayed at the front counter so you can see what you're actually getting.
