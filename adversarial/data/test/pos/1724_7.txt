It's pretty easy to sh*t on the Hard Rock as it's best days seem to be behind it, but it's really not a bad place to stay. You can scoop up an HRH room for around the $100 mark most weeknights and they hold up against any room on the strip. The $22 resort fee (per day for wifi and gym use) is a crock, but it seems unavoidable these days. I mean, $66 for three days of net\/gym? Lame. As i mentioned the HRH king suite happens to be a nice room. Decorated well, large bathroom, couch, 2 tv's.... it's a comfortable stay. I found the staff (valet\/bell guy\/front desk\/bartender) to be nothing but professional and helpful. \n\nIf you can stand the occasional youngins running around, the HRH can be a nice staycation spot. You have Mr Lucky's for a quick bite (24\/7), drinks at both center bars, Nobu, Pink Taco, 35 Steaks + Martini and you can catch a show at the Joint (or always see the Diceman at Vinyl). Nice room and things to do? HRH, I have no qualms with you.
