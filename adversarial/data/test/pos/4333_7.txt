This is not my favorite resort on the strip.  For me, the check-in lines are unacceptably long and it's filled with kids (no offense to kids--I have three darlings of my own).  In the summer, this is definitely a great place to go with kids because they will enjoy the lazy river and wave pool.  If you find yourself there without kids and not realizing that \"One Direction\" is in concert, you had better hit the adult only pool for a little serenity!  LOL  \n\nThat being said, I love the lounges and restaurants here.  My room was fine--a few hiccups with house-keeping, but all around fine.  Again, bring the kids.
