I'm not going to lie, I end up at Pho Kim Long down the street more often only because it's open 24 hours and I always go after a night out with friends. But when it's open, I always go to Kinh Do!\n\nThe food is so much better than Pho Kim Loong. The broth is the best I've ever had!\n\n*check in and get 2 free egg rolls*
