Here are the facts:\n\n1) Husband goes through button down shirts faster than I go through a pan of brownies (well, not really, but close)\n2) I don't really like to iron, nor do I do it well, ditto husband\n3) Jos A Bank runs more sales than any store imaginable.\n\nConsidering these three facts, it's understandable that I find myself in Jos A Bank once every quarter or so to pick up some button downs for dear husband. The shirts are nice - especially the Traveler's Collection - no iron required! They also have a solid variety of suits, accessories, sweaters, etc. A few points to note for shoppers...\n\n-Sales folks *can* be pushy and a bit overbearing. This completely depends on the day and the person helping you. Sometimes I've had to politely ask for some time and space to just look around a bit. \n\n-It seems like they have a fire sale every week. You can catch these over hyped promotions on the radio and on local cable. I'm still waiting for the moment where the commercial says \"Buy one sweater, get the entire store for FREE!\"\n\nSo, I will continue to go here because hubs likes some of the wares, it can be affordable with the right sale and it's easy.
