Crystals City Center is located right next to Aria and this place has a few shops mainly high end shopping to buy either a new hand bag or some jewelry. It is mainly empty and for some reason I do enjoy places that have less people. \n\nMost of the time I don't buy anything here but I do enjoy walking around and just browsing. \n\nThe only thing that I would say is pretty nice and affordable is Starbucks! Pretty nice and it is a place to sit back and relax in.
