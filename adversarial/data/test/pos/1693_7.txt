It's hard to imagine growing up with fax machines and then realizing that most places no longer provide that service anymore. Besides fax services, I come here for Christmas packages when I don't have time for the huge lines at the post office. It gets busy here too, but the service is faster. \nThey also rent mailboxes of different sizes, but, don't worry any size package large or super large is received here for you.
