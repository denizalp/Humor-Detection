Night it up is the prime time for a teenager to get with their friends, stay out late (for a high school kid.. man, I thought I was so cool) and stuff themselves with delicious Asian food after begging their parents for money. It was my favourite time of the year. \n\nHowever, as a fully grown semi-mature adult, it is just.... meh. The only reason I'd wanna go is to keep my tradition of going every year, even if I don't really have a craving or want of anything they offer. The worst part of NIU is always the performers and music- free entertainment but 90% of the performers seem to have never touched an instrument in their life or so tone deaf to the point where it seems like i, myself is going deaf. I cannot stress the amount of times I had to bite down my tongue to resist screaming \"SHUT UP\" at the stage... NIU, can you please evaluate if anyone actually CAN perform before hiring them?! \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is going on the last day. Loads of parking (no frills, how many times have you threatened to tow my car away? yeah, yeah. BYE), tons of space to walk compared to Friday (on Friday, all I can smell is smelly tofu, bbq and BO) and most of the food is on clearance and almost 50% cheaper than the selling price on Friday. My favourite booth every year is always the Osaka authentic takoyaki. DON'T GET ANY OTHER TAKOYAKI! My boyfriend made a mistake of buying from another vendor due to a short line and UGH, it doesn't even compare to osaka's crispy and soft texture that's packed with flavour. I also enjoy the roasted corn and the squid. On Friday, I got one stick of 1 piece of tentacles for $5, and Sunday I got 2 sticks of 4 pieces for $6. It really makes a big difference in price. I don't really venture out into any of the overpriced vendors because half the places have stores and the other half is ridiculously overpriced. (Drink a fruit from the fruit booth is $10 per juice from a watermelon\/pineapple..... are you kidding me?) \n\nOf course I always end up going again and again every year, but now I know... Sundays are the day to go- less annoying kids (who brings a baby or strollers to this?!), cheaper food and less chance of seeing every single person from Markham that you know.
