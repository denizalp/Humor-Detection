The first time I came here it was great. The last time I came here the staff made me feel like crap. The manager was persistent I order food, even after I bought a drink. He asked me to order something or I would be kicked out. He even shoved a menu onto my table even after I told him I did not want to order food. I was just hanging out enjoying my drink. It's definitely not a place to hangout unless you are going to buy food apparently. Not cool. I will never go to Hob Nobs again. It should change its name to Hob Snobs. \n\nP.S. Their music sucks.
