We have been wanting to come here again for such a long time now.\nIt is one of my girlfriends best loved Mexican Food places. But, we never find ourselves out in this part of town too much.\nWe came in for an early dinner. about 4 :15.\nWe were greeted and seated in a great booth right away.\nChips and salsa are delish here no doubt.  The green and the red sause are amazing.\nIt is decorated very nicely.  Drinks were good. Teresa was given fresh coffe,(her absolute favorite with Mexican food.\nShe got the Crab enchiladas and I got the chicken enchiladas. AWESOME!\nGood thing this is not too close to us,we would gain far too much.\nlots of parking and nice clean restrooms as well.\nToo bad it is so hot outside, because the patios are beautiful!
