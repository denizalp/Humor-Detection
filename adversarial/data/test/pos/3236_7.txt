Rudy's Italian Restaurant & Bar is as awful a place as I have ever come across. Rudy's has really terrible food, really terrible service, very high prices, and to top it all off, they committed credit card fraud. Allow me to give some details about this dreadful restaurant.\n\nTERRIBLE food. We ordered two house salads. The menu describes the \"Insalata Rudy's\" as \"Field greens tossed w\/diced pears, caramelized walnuts, raisins & gorgonzola honey dressing\". What we got was lettuce w\/very unripe, hard and flavorless small cubes of pear. Hardly any walnuts and raisins. And no gorgonzola honey dressing. Instead of any actual salad dressing, the lettuce was coated with oil. Not olive oil. The lettuce was oiled up with unflavored cooking oil. I would guess it was either plain Wesson or canola oil.\n\nVERY HIGH prices. When you look at the real cost that you are paying at Rudy's, you feel like a sucker for paying so much for such lousy food. The real cost includes the menu price, plus tax, plus 15% tip. So for two \"Insalata Rudy's\" you are going to pay over $17.\n\nTERRIBLE food. For an appetizer we ordered the \"Baked artichokes stuffed with goat cheese and spinach in a roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce\". What we got was a few marinated artichokes right out of the marinated artichoke jar that is found on the store shelf. Instead of garden fresh \"Baked artichokes\" we were served unpleasant, sour, vinegary, marinated artichokes. And the \"roasted pepper garlic white wine sauce\" never made it to the plate. No sauce at all. This was a truly terrible, way overpriced dish.\n\nTERRIBLE food. One entr√©e special was the \"Pan seared Tilapia with a garlic sauce\". The fish was not pan seared, it was baked. It was mushy. It was flavorless and was served without the sauce. \n\nTERRIBLE service. Our server, first thing, told us that \"tonight was half price martini night\". When our bill came I noticed that we had been charged full price for two unusually expensive martinis. His explanation was that \"half price martini night only applies if you are seated in the bar\".\n\nCREDIT CARD FRAUD. I discovered that a week after dining at Rudy's someone at the restaurant had increased the amount of the credit card charge by 27 %. This was illegally done without my permission and without my knowledge. \n\nThe lessons to be learned from Rudy's is that what you read on the menu or are told by the waiter is not what will be served at the table. Once Rudy's has your credit card, they may try to swindle you (as they did me). At the end of the meal you will have overpaid for appallingly bad strip-mall-food.
