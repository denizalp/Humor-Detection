Beer Cheers to Andrew \"Dude\" C. leader of the UYE Brews Cruise for coordinating the meet up at Fate Brewing Company, for without him I don't know if fate alone would have brought me here.\nI started our brews cruise with the Oh my Gatos Hatch Chile Cream Ale, it had a light aroma and flavor of green chili without the heat. I'm an AZ gal and could've handled some heat but it was still the group's and my favorite!\n   I continued the cruise by tasting my friend's Fate-Ality IPA which claims to have an irresponsible amount of hops and does not disappoint,  if hops is your thing this brew is for you...but any more for me and I would have been sunk!\n   But why stop there I had to keep the beer theme flowing, so I ordered the BBC starter, beer battered chicken and sweet potato fries on the side. It was enough to keep me afloat with good flavor and plenty to share with the crew.\n   My brews cruise mates ordered the Grape Escape pizza and as always were kind enough to share. It was topped with garlic oil, mozzarella, roasted grapes, goat cheese, rosemary, balsamic glaze and caused me to have food envy, don't you hate it when that happens!? I'll be back to get one of my own! \nAs fate would have it, we ended the night there or it would have been Uber taking me home. \nIf you're into good brew and food, then cruise on over to Fate Brewing!\n Happy Yelping and Eating! :) Cheers!\n\n.
