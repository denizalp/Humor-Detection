I typically don't review chain stores and restaurants, but I've made an exception for this Costco.  Why, you ask?  Because Costco's in Canada rock!  Why do they rock, you ask?  Because they serve one of the best poutine fries I've ever had!  Yeah, that's right.  Poutine from Costco is good.  My taste in poutine may not be the most developed, but out of all of the versions I've tried in Canada and in NYC, this is my favorite.  For about $5, you get a huuuge plastic container of crispy seasoned fries smothered in brown gravy and topped with tons of cheese curds.  Pure artery-clogging heaven.
