This is the best quality ice cream I've had in a long time. There are some places where you waver between a 4 star and 5 star, but not this place. They deserve that 5 man. \n\nThe creamy texture of their ice cream is unreal. With each bite I took, I kept thinking I was feasting on gelato. It was that dense and full-bodied. The distinguishing factor between ice cream and gelato for me is the mouth feel. While ice cream will melt rather quickly once it settles on the tongue, gelato takes its time in dissolving. Swiping your spoon across gelato will result in a beautifully sticky stretchy strand, whereas ice cream is harder and will readily detach from the mass.While La Michoacana certainly claims they make and sell ice cream, the similarity to gelato in terms of texture is striking and delicious.\n\nAside from texture, the flavors at La Michoacana really had me going. In addition to the more traditional chocolate, vanilla, oreo, and coffee ice cream options, they offer tamarind, pine nut, eggnog with raisins, and the two I went for: goat milk toffee and tequila. \n\nBoth of the flavors I ordered were serious winners. As I was eating my cup of goodness, I was already planning my next trip back, thinking of all the friends I have to bring so they can experience La Michoacana. \n\nThe goat's milk or Cajeta ice cream was the color of a light chocolate, yet it tasted like caramel. I love caramel, but attempts at caramel ice cream are oftentimes too sweet. This Cajeta was perfect. It delivered that caramel flavor without tasting too sugary.\n\nThey also nailed it with the tequila ice cream. If you're going to say something is tequila flavored, you better taste that tequila and with this ice cream, you taste it. The flavor is pronounced and proud, and in a good way.\n\nThus in terms of its crazy awesome, gelato-like texture and its smashing flavor, the ice cream at La Michoacana is seriously impressive. Like I said, I'm planning that next trip back because I'm already craving more goat's milk and tequila.
