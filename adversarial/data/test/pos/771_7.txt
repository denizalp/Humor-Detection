I really am digging this new hot spot! It's conveniently located on Eastern, right in the complex where Trader Joe's, Home store and etc. the parking isn't bad, there's plenty of it, even if you have to park far, it's not an inconvenience. I actually parked by the restaurant and ate first then went grocery store shopping at Trader Joe's (Cookie Butter Time) \nUpon arriving I noticed the delicious aroma the parking was filled with, and officially knew Dinner was going to be fantastic. As I entered I was immediately greeted by the staff and asked if I needed any help understanding the menu, the worker even said, this is a Korean food version of Chipotle. I thought nice, easy and good! I can customize my bowl the way I want and not have to eat veggies I have no desire to eat.\nI carefully examined the menu and immediately knew I wanted the stone bowl ( keeps the food hot) \nMy next step was picking out my choose of protein, I opted for the Bulgogi Beef, and next was my rice- I love white rice, but don't love the starch, so I opted for the purple rice a combo of white,brown,black rice- and it was amazing (loved the flavor and texture) \nNext onto my veggies- so many to choose from, and you get up to six choices- so I opted for bean sprouts,zucchini,spinach,carrots, and mushroom,\nNext was my sauce (soybean sauce) and to top it off I got the egg!  \nSo after paying I was told to sit down and they will serve me my bowl. I waited a few mins and they brought out my hot bowl and instructed me to be carful when handling the bowl.  \nI am definitely coming back again, I need to try this bowl again with Salmon, Chicken and Tofu, and all the different sauces they have available!  This is definitely a win,win,win for people who love rice bowl style food!  I don't know about you but, I love rice and I can eat it with anything or even by itself
