Hanmoto is a tiny, hole-in-the-wall-izakaya-dive-bar (is that even a thing?) located on Lakeview Avenue, a tiny street west of Dundas and Ossington. It is definitely easy to miss if you do not have your eyes peeled.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the following dishes:\n- Salmon Aburi: Torched salmon, sushi rice ($10)\n- Hamachi Tartare: Sweet chill ponzu, shiso, avocado ($12)\n- Uni-Bomb: Uni roe, chicken skin chips, sushi rice ($15)\n- Katsu Bun: Panko crusted 24hr pork belly, soy remoulade, lettuce ($7)\n- Dyno Wings: Stuffed chicken wings ($8)\n- Miso Ice Cream: Nori powder, toasted rice balls ($7)\n\nThe unanimous favourites included the salmon aburi, hamachi tartare, uni-bomb, and miso ice cream. The miso ice cream was particularly an eye-opener, with the saltiness of the nori pairing exceptionally well with the sweetness of the ice cream. While the katsu bun was super flavourful, it was a bit too fatty for our palates (i.e. fried pork belly + a ton of mayo, or \"soy remoulade\") - it is definitely for sharing. The dyno wings were also pretty good, but compared to some of the other amazing dishes, ultimately became more of an after-thought.\n\nOverall, the food, combined with the intimate vibe and coziness of this establishment makes it great if you're taking someone on a date, or simply catching up with some friends. Definitely recommended.
