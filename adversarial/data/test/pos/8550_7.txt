Typical Target - good selection and prices, pretty clean, friendly people working there.  I saw a security guard helping a lady with her cart, and for some reason it reaffirmed my faith in humanity.  I wish the parking lot were swept a little more often, and I wish this location had a grocery section, but otherwise it's a great place to get stuff you need.  \n\nAnd as an added bonus: the people who shop here will never end up on peopleofwalmart.com.  Enough said.
