I came here on a Wednesday night and it was dead empty. Should have been my first clue, but I had a groupon to use. \n\nOrdered the sushi and sashimi combo and got it a couple minutes later. Didn't come with miso soup\/ edemame\/ etc. All I can say is it was a mistake to order sushi in a dead place like that. The preparation seemed ok, but the fish was less than fresh. It all tasted a little stale and was slightly mushy. Even had one piece of nigiri that the end of the fish was dried out... server didn't really do anything about it though. The guy never filled my water until I was done eating either. Not like there was much else to do that night.\n\nCan't say if their teppanyaki would be any better, but stick with cooked foods and you may have a better experience.
