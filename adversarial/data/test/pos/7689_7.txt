First of all, I'm tired of restaurants that play thumping music in the background and put a pair of cleavage cuties at the host stand to mask the weak food and marginal service.  And then have servers that appear to have never left Arizona but are experts in sushi and Japanese cuisine.  I realize that they're not a real \"Japanese\" restaurant, but nevertheless...\n\nBar staff was mediocre.  I sat there with little attention.  Food is nothing to write home about; nothing I had really stands out and it didn't seem the staff had any convincing recommendations.  It's not outrageously expensive, but it could get a bit pricey depending on how you order.  I suppose if you're here for a trendy snack before heading out dancing, it might fit, but if you actually want a meal, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nTo top my meal off, I had a dry, flaky, not-so-tasty dessert that looked like an afterthought.  I realize desserts are the big margin item at a restaurant, but for $7, I would have liked it to look better put together.\n\nSkip this one.  Especially at this location.  If you want the scene, go to Scottsdale.
