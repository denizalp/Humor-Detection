So after having these lashes for a week and half and looking at the work closely, I was really disappointed with the work done. A lot of the lashes weren't perfect fans like 3D lashes should be and were more like clumped together. Another problem was that I saw these clusters glued to multiple lashes rather than a single natural lash.  3 natural lashes glued together with a cluster! I saw this twice. \n\n Also some of the extensions weren't 3D but were random from 1-4D\nThe placement of some of the lashes weren't close enough to the root either so they started looking too grown out after just a week and we're twisting and turning in different directions and falling out easier as a result .\n\nAlso, one eye was visibly fuller than the other. I could see many natural lashes on my right eye that had not been extended. I did notice that the girl who did my lashes had another appointment right after me and so she must have rushed on me. \n\nI don't recommend coming here because the quality isn't what you would expect for the price.. When you take a closer look at things you will see how sloppy everything was done.
