Let's put a Starbucks with a drive through right on your route to work... diabolical. I'm not a big coffee drinker but I am trying (and failing) to drink green tea so this is a good place to get my fix. So far I have been lucky and haven't encountered any super long drive through lines (I'm not going to get out of my car after all- I'll go to the gym if I want to work out) but maybe I just get there at super awesome times? Or maybe anytime I'm there it by definition becomes a super awesome time? Probably.\n\nI also like the drive through because I can order a strawberries and cream frappacino and not have to go pick it up in front of everyone- feeling all those eyes on me, judging me, and the laughter- oh how they laugh... Real men drink pink drinks people- get used to it it's the 21st century and no it is not correlated with the decline of America as a super power. \n\nAnywhoo, sometimes I have 6-8 hours to kill so I come here with my macbook to work on my screenplay and order only water. Nice little Saturday.
