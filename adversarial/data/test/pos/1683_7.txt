Lack of service from waitstaff, extremely poor quality meats and vegetables, bland broth (Japanese Miso & Tom Yum). Bartending stirring spoons for serving the sauces????\n\nNothing (including the water) tasted good and actually made us both sick the rest of the evening and next day. \n\nOn the phone we were told dinner for two adults for $35.95 with a 20% off special. At checkout the discount was only 10% even after showing the check-in special for a Yelp 20% off. \"Only 10. Only 10.\" was the response. \n\nI've been a local for four years and this was by far the worst food I have had in Vegas.
