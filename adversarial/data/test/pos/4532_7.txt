When I went, it was only a day after their soft opening, so it's understandable that the workers were still in training and a bit slow. The chicken is definitely on the pricier side, but it's definitely worth the price as the taste is completely different and better than what you would find at other chicken joints we know of like KFC or Popeyes. If this is what all Korean style fried chicken tastes like, I love it! \n\nI ordered the chicken strips and tried the soy garlic. I also got the seasoned fries as a side dish. As for the soy garlic, I definitely dig the taste! However, considering that I'm not much of a sweets person, I got tired of the taste on my last 2 pieces of chicken. Yes, the soy garlic definitely has a sweeter taste to it. However, I think I can balance that on my next visit by getting a half and half and trying the spicy chicken. As for the the fries, it was one of the crispest fries that I've ever had and I absolutely love it. Definitely something I'll order on every visit. It's a must-try!\n\nThe reason why I give this place 4 stars is because of the air conditioning problem they had. It was definitely hot in there. Well, probably for other people, it's fine, but I enjoy being seated in cold temperatures, the same as other restaurants. Maybe they had problems with the contractors, but I definitely regretted wearing a white shirt that day.
