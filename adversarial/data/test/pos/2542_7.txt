During my recent stay in Calgary, I took an Associated Cab twice for an average of 3 Stars.\n\n- From the Airport to Downtown (4 Stars). This was a nice ride with a good driver who rode his seat belt, didn't dart around or speed, and was pleasant to talk with about this and that. \n\nFrom B'nai Tikvah (Rosh Hashana Services) to the Sheraton Eau Claire (2 Stars). A helpful Calgary Police Officer who was looking after the place during services (unfortunately that's anti-semitic reality in the Jewish Community) was good enough to call a Cab  that never really showed up after a long wait. Another Cab was called and this one was late as I stood alone outside the Shul after everyone else had gone home. And it was too far to walk, although that Plan B almost became reality. At that point, I was so pissed that I didn't really care or notice how he was driving.
