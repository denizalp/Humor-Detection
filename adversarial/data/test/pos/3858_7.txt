Perfect place for any vegans or vegetarians visiting town.  They all seem to get a kick out of the whole premise of the place. Think of it as starring in your very own imaginary \"Gay Vegan Nazi\" episode of Seinfeld. Obey the rules or get banned for life. Be insulted or made fun of. Do not step out of line by asking for something like \"salt\" and definitely do not request to turn down the volume if the owner is listening to bad, loud disco.   \n\nBut most people go not in spite of but because of the service. They get a kick out of the deliberately bitchy attitude that contributes to the Spirite Lounge's mystique. That said, after a few visits the \"attitude\" begins to feel like an elaborate and contrived schtick.  Once the novelty wears off, you're left with the food. And it seems like the restaurant has been running on fumes for the past few years after its heyday earlier in the decade. The fact is the food (although supposedly a rotating single menu without, of course, any choice) always tastes the same and thus gets boring very quickly (and I have begun to have the sinking suspicion that the sad truth is that it was just not very good to begin with).  In other words, a fun restaurant to try once for the novelty of the experience\/surroundings. Go once and forever rest in peace.
