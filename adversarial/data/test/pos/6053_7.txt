My local Chainsaw shop that my father taught me to goto closed a few years back and I have struggled to find a place to get work done on the saws that I own that are not Stihl Brand. (Take all my Stihl stuff to browns John Deere in Acme Pa)\n\nSo I have stopped in a few times and talked to Tom (owner) about Echo products as I own a CS346 small saw and I figured I would give him a shot to fix my stuff.\n\nI paid $230 for two saw tune ups including new spark plugs and two new good chains to be installed and one saw needed a new pull cord starter.\n\nThe $230 I spent I feel was a total rip off. \n\nI decided to sit my self down and get as educated as I possibly could about the workings of both the engines in my saws.\n\nBasically what I have discovered is that our gasoline is killing our equipment. I wish that shops could fix this problem with a flush out but they just can't.\n\nI'm wiser now, than I was when I felt like I had been ripped off and I now realize that it's the machines themselves and the engineering behind them that makes stuff difficult to work on.
