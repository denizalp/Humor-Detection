This was my first ever massage. The place was clean, the staff friendly and it was definitely quiet and relaxing. The beds\/sheets were very soft and comfortable. If you're a fan of massages then I imagine you will like this place. I, however, just don't think massages are for me. That being said I would have given more stars because I can see past my personal dislike of an experience, but the therapist hurt my right leg somehow. Shortly after my massage it was as if my right thigh muscle was so weak it would just give out. I thought it might get better, but it still happens from time to time. Really weird and kind of hard to explain, but it never happened before so I know it was related. It doesn't actually cause any pain, but with certain movements it feels like my muscle shifts and then collapses. Weird!\n\nAnyhow, other than that the place itself was great so I'd say give them a shot!
