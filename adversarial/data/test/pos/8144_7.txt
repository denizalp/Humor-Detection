Super slow in getting the food out. \n\nFood is 3 stars. OK BBQ. My husband liked the brisket over the ribs. My chicken was tender. \n\nLive music was pretty good. \n\nI had a pear blueberry vodka drink and it was amazingly refreshing and not overly sweet. \n\n4 stars because they are still working out the service, but the manager saw that I was looking around and came over to let me know someone will take my order shortly. I appreciated that. \n\nMy daughter enjoyed herself. Thanks for being family friendly.
