I was super excited to see this Ulta since I've only known Ulta from their online store, so it was only an added plus to see this place on my way to Trader Joe's in the Summerlin Mall area.\n\nThey have a nice selection of make-up items and beauty items and this shop reminds me of a smaller, lower-end Sephora. The prices were moderate but it was still a handy area to get all your beauty needs in one place. It was super busy so no one acknowledged me but I get that.\n\nI was going to buy an eye-liner but decided against it when I saw over ten people waiting in line. I was on vacation and standing around to buy one item wasn't appealing. I'll give them another shot in the future when I re-visit Summerlin Mall.
