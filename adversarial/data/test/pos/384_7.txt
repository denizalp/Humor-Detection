Uhhhh, not a mile long... not even close. However even though it's not a mile long, it's really easy to get LOST in the funky shaped U thing they have going on... it took a map, 3 gals and 15 minutes to find H&M in this place.\n\nRegular ole mall...kinda like any which one you'd have at home. But it worked to kill some time walking around on a slow evening after dinner. Of course I managed to find something to buy, I always do!!
