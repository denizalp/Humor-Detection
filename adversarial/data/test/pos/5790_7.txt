I quite enjoyed my time at Postrio and I was going to give it 4 stars for the ambiance, food, and service, until this afternoon when I got a look at my credit card bill.  \n\nWe came here for an early dinner, and I hadn't had much of an appetite that evening, so I ordered the steak skewers off the appetizer menu ($14).  We decided to split the bill by paying differing amounts on credit cards, I put down a total of $20 to account for tax and tip, which I felt was reasonable, which itself was already a 23% tip for my meal.  \n\nSo back to this afternoon when I checked my online credit card account.  I was charged, $24.  No way would I have left $10 for a $14 meal.  I unfortunately misplaced my receipt, but my friend I had dinner with luckily kept hers.  She signed for $23 and was charged $29 on her credit card.  So we call Postrio and hoped that this is all a misunderstanding or mistyping on the register.\n\nIt was not.  The person on the phone looked it up AND THE WAITER, ANDRE SMIT, HAD PRINTED OUT A NEW RECEIPT, PUT EXTRA TIP ON THE CARD AND FORGED HER SIGNATURE.  \n\nYes, it may have only been 4 or 6 dollars, but the whole principle of it all.  Complete invasion of privacy and straight up crime.\n\nWe have the carbon copy of the receipt here, it's not even like it's one of those places that prints out two and you fill them out separately, it is literally a copy of what the restaurant should have gotten.\n\nThis is completely UNACCEPTABLE for any kind of establishment.  I will update with what the restaurant is doing after we send over the receipts.  But as for now, restaurants need to keep watch on their waiters, and we will never return again.
