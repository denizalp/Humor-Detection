The sushi was not bad but not the best ever. It wasnt as good as Ra or Sapporo but it wasnt bad like Shogun. KWIM? It was similar to Ra or Sapporo in ambiance. I'd probably return.\n\nI was however annoyed because our douchey server would not GO AWAY because he was too busy hitting on my friend to actually do his duties as a server. We had gossiping to catch up on, g-damit! Need help with chopsticks, ladies? Douchey server will hold your hand and show you how.
