Remember Gil ... The car salesman on the Simpsons? Well we had a very similar experience here. You don't need all the flash that you see at some places to sell me a car but don't say \"I'm not good with numbers\" so early on in your pitch! I guess it was a lot more honesty than I've seen elsewhere but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.
