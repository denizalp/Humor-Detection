Another facade joint with an air of exclusivity. \nWe were skulking through the casino when someone pushed a card in our hands for \"VIP entry\" into the Voodoo Lounge.  They got thrown into the back of my handbag until the last night in Vegas when we considered two things:\n\n1. We hadn't yet had a decent cocktail.\n2. It sounded like there were good views to be had at the top floor.\n\nThe door people certainly do enforce the dress code, turning away a couple wearing casual sportswear and flip flops. We were hardly dressed at the height of fashion, but we weren't slovenly either, so we were welcomed in.\n\nThe place was near empty, which wasn't a surprise, being late on a Monday, and the large screen tv was playing Scarface, that was a plus. \n\nThe outdoor area, while empty, does have great potential. I do loves me a cage to dance in every now and then. And being this high up is naturally euphoric. There is a very expansive view of the strip, it's a great photo opportunity. But you know what else? The expansive view of the strip means you are nowhere near the strip. Talk about feeling left out.\n\nAnyway, for all the potential of the outside dance area, the music being played was not impressive. Greenday, twice, in an hour, at a club with a \"hip\" dress code?\n\nWe went to the bar and ordered a Manhattan. What we like in a Manhattan is for it to be stirred and served with a cherry that's not one of those chemical neon abominations. What we got was a drink tossed about in the air and shaken with such fervor it had an inch of froth on the top and we couldn't even see the dyed and brined cherry. $13.\nApparently, some people like that. But a cocktail that's 90% showmanship isn't our thing. That's Vegas for you, I guess.\n\nGood panoramic photos, at least.
