I prefer Target miles and away above Walmart.  You might just have to hold a gun to my head to get me to shop at Walmart, and if we're being honest, I feel like that's a legitimate risk when I go in that giant blue building.  So I shop at Target.  \n\nThis particular location is great because it's in Tempe Marketplace, so anything else you may need is nearby.  I knock off one star only because of the layout of the store... I get lost every time!  This may speak some to my sense of direction, but this store just confuses me.  If this is a strategic move to get guests to peruse more aisles, it works.\n\nI do general grocery shopping at grocery stores, but if I'm at Target and need a couple items, I'll gladly get them here... produce aside, prices tend to be pretty good.
