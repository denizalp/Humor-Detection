I was not impressed by the long wait to see a doctor.  Unless you are dying, you will be expected to wait at least 4 hours or more.  They have a nurse to check you first, and then you're directed to wait in the reception area.  After 2 hours, you get to sit inside the room to wait for a doctor. 2 more hours gone by, the doctor finally came.  They really need to take \"Urgent\" out of their name.  The only plus is that they do friendly staffs.
