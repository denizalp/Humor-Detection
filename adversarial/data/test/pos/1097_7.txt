This festival is very dear to my heart as I was one of the founding organizers of the preceding festival, Charlotte Pride and got back involved in 2006 when the LGBT Community Center took over the event .\n\nThe festival has been at a different location the last 3 years (Gateway Village, the NC Music Factory, and Tryon St.).  I was last iinvolved in the organization in 2009.  \n\nI resigned due to conflicts with one of the organizers.  That person is no longer involved and it shows.  The festival was held back last year and I would have given it 3 stars last year because of it.  \n\nWith the new leadership, This year's event was moved to Tryon Street in front of the Wells Fargo Buildings and the New Levine Arts Campus.  The festival grew to 3 stages.  \n\nEntertainment featured local performers as well as national performers including the Gay Mens Chorus of Charlotte, One Voice Chorus, Charlotte Pride Band, Snagglepuss, Jessica Wild, Eyes of the Elders, Richard Cortez, Ryan Cassata, Nubia SoulGoddess, Eryn Woods and more.\n\nThere were vendors of all types along the street - banks, community organizations, t-shirt and jewelry vendors, sports organizations, social clubs, food and drink vendors.  There was even a kids area to make this family friendly.  \n\nThe sponsor list seems to be growing as well:  Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Time Warner Cable, Food Lion, AT&T, AON Hewitt, Drake Dentistry, Pepsico, Coors Light, churches, atheist group, and more.\n\nI haven't seen exact attendance numbers but I know it was at least double last year's attendance.  I heard one estimate of 25,000 but I don't know about that one.  But it's possible.\n\nAnyway, I way thoroughly impressed and proud to know that I helped plant this seed back in 2001.  \n\nThank you to the organizers and friends who kept this going.  It's nice to see Charlotte evolving where LGBT people are being accepted more and more.
