FIRE OVEN\n\nGrabbed some pizzas from here for lunch & it was AMAZING!! We had to do togo becuase we had people waiting at home for it. \nThe staff was very friendly and frequent in making sure their guests were taken care of. \n\nIt literally only took 15 minutes for our pizzas to be ready from the moment we placed our orders.\n\nWe got the pizza of the week with pesto sauce & tomato w\/ garlic which I thought was hands down AWSOME!\n\nBianca was another one we got with the balsamic reduction! \nWe got one other pizza but i forgot the name..\nThe dough was chewy and crispy! So good & you could just tell the cheese was fresh! Definately will be back to try the dining experience more & the pizza would probably taste so much better when it is Hot!
