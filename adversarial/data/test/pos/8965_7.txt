Came in with a group of 4 all first timers.  Signed in and saw many empty seats so the ladies proceeded to sit down.  A rude employee came over and started telling us that it's not appropriate to seat ourselves.  This place has no host,  is quite small,  and no waiting area.  I saw the sign-in book and signed us in but the others may naturally walked to all the open seats.  The place only had a few people. \n\nIt was all very odd and made everyone quite uncomfortable to be lectured life that after just walking in to a new restaurant. . We just turned and left.  \n\nJust because you have good reviews doesn't give you the right to belittle your potential customers.
