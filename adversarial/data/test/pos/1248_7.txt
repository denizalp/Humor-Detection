There is a liquor store in the same complex I work and I use to go there until I realized how amazing Top's Liquor is.  Its a little out of the way for me.  But its worth it. There selection is far more SUPERIOR than any other in town. \n\nThere prices are the best Ive seen.  They are very knowledgable and helpful.  They assisted me in purchasing Malbecs, whiskeys and even some crazy mescal that I couldn't find anywhere else.  \n\nIf you need beer, alcohol or wine this is where you should be buying it.  Best selection at the best prices from a knowledgable staff.  What else could you ask for.
