First time in NODA in years and years. Was anxious to see the development and new stuff going on up there.   The Crepe Cellar is not new; it has been around for about ten years. I don't think I had eaten there before, so Janet, my cousin-in-law,  and I decided to travel some distance to check it out. The place was fabulous.  Outstanding food. Outstanding ambiance. Outstanding service. Everything was in perfect order and I loved it, until the bill arrived. We both had the Crepe du Jour, which had chicken and beans and other fresh ingredients that made our taste buds dance.  The price of this special was not on the blackboard, so I assumed it was in line with the other prices on the menu.  Turns out, each crepe was $16.  Now, let me remind you, this was NOT a fresh catch of the day.  This was a C R E P E.  I don't blame them for not putting the price on the board!   I had a side of Brussel sprouts and misunderstood that a side was NOT included with the meal. The Brussel Sprouts, however, were amazing and worth the miles to get to this restaurant.  And the iced tea, which was the best I've had in ages, was fresh and so tasty, but $3.00 a glass was simply too much. I probably wouldn't gripe about $2.00 a glass.  In conclusion, a $50 lunch was NOT what I had in mind for the two of us.  Clearly, it was overpriced, even if the food was terrific.  Even if the atmosphere was terrific.   Oh, it turns out the owner has four restaurants right there together in NODA.   Obviously he has a great thing going and with his special crepes going for $16, he must be amongst the very rich and famous in the Queen City.   Go check out this restaurant, but take your fat wallet with you!
