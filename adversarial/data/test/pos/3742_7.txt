Archie's has always delivered every time I've ever eaten there. They consistently make good food and have good service. \n\nI personally like the chicken fried rice and the beef pepper steak. The flavors are mouth watering. \n\nThe wor won ton is delicious too! Can't ever go wrong with a bowl of soup. \n\nOverall one of the better Thai food places in Las Vegas.
