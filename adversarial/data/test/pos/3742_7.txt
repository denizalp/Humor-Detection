This is on,y the second time that I have had dim sum in my life ever so it's had for me to gauge the authenticity.  I can say that we were served warm plates of tasty stuff.\n\nCame here hungry with a coupla buddies of mine and left completely comatosed.  It's been a week or so since I went so I dont' have a good recollection.\n\nSorry.  Too bad--Yelp! is more for me anyways :\/\n\ndmo out
