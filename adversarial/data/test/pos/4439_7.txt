Pros: We ended up eating at The Apple Dumplin in Urbana, which was great\nCons: Just a horrible, horrible experience\nMy Advice: Stay away, stay far, far away\n\nI'm 32 years old and in my adult life I had never walked out of a restaurant refusing to pay for the food. Then I visited the Hen House. It was just terrible. \n\nA quick recap:\n\nI ordered Chicken Fried Steak. When the meal was brought out to me, I just sort of sat there and stared at it, probably with a stupid surprised look on my face. It looked like a hamburger, so I cut it open aaaaaaand it still looked like a hamburger. When the waitress returned, I asked her what it was and she told me it was chopped steak. I'm not real sure what chopped steak is. That being said, steak my ass, it was a damn hamburger. Even if it was Prime Rib, though, it wasn't what I ordered. Strike one!\n\nMy fiance ordered Fried Chicken. When she attempted to take a bite out of it, she got nothing. After telling me that it was too hard to bite anything off, I had to try it for myself. She wasn't joking! I had to stop biting down for fear that I would break off my partially repaired front tooth. I swear, you could have used that chicken as a hammer. Strike two!\n\nMy step-daughter-to-be ordered a childrens pizza meal. This was just your average personal deep dish pizza that you buy frozen at Wal-Mart. That's all fine and well, good enough to keep a 4-year old happy. Believe it or not, they actually managed to screw that up too, though. When it was brought out the first time, it was still frozen in the middle. The second time it came out, it was still cold. The third time, I think it was actually warm, but by that time we'd had enough. Strike three, out the door we go!!\n\nDisclaimer: My son ordered pancakes and bacon. It actually appeared to be satisfactory. Sorry, though, 25% is not good enough.
