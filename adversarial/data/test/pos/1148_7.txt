I am writing strictly a review for their mystic tan. I do not use tanning beds.\n\nDO NOT GET YOUR SPRAY TAN HERE. I spray tan weekly, and came to Vegas for work needing to get a last minute spray done. The next morning I woke up with streaks down my leg and barely any darker than I was previously. I chose the darkest color (level 3). I have very fair skin, and I look maybe a shade of beige. The worst spray tan experience I have ever had.
