The District at Green Valley Ranch is a small, outdoor mall located right in front of the Green Valley Ranch casino itself. AND they have the other side of the mall located across the street with more shop until you drop (or eat) places. \n\nParking can be quite limited so you may consider walking around the area. Unless you're across the street where parking is ample for the other stores.\n\nWhere can you shop here?(just naming a few)\nREI, Anthropologie, William Sonoma, Coldwater Creek, White House\/Black Market, Pottery Barn, Loft, Aveda, Chico's, Soma intimates, West Elm\n\nWhat can I eat here? (just naming a few)\nElephant Bar, P.F. Changs, Cheesecake Factory, Ben & Jerry's, Lucille's, Panera Bread, Coffee Bean Tea & Leaf \n\nI'm just here to window shop since I don't have the funds to shop here. The location looks really nice and fancy. But other than that you may consider shopping at the outlets or the other malls, which have more variety of stores.
