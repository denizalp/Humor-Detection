Ate here twice now. They have a stupid seating system. You can't request or put your name down until everyone in your party has arrived. This makes no sense! If we're a party of 12 for instance then your entire party has to be here before they can put your name down! How does that work? The entire party gets here and then they still can't do anything except wait around. Why can't we just put our names down and then wander around your Casino or do other things and come back at the designated time? The girls up in the front working up as hostess are just doing what they're told to do but it's a stupid rule that makes them look foolish!\n\nThe next time we were here we were only a party of four and one of us had a bad back. We requested a soft back chair like a booth but they said that the entire party had to be here first. And even then there was no guarantee that we would get a booth despite the fact that we would request it and wait for it! How does this help any? Again it's a stupid system with stupid rules are they have to follow!\n\nAs for the food, it was pretty good, more flare than anything else! They use the Mangalitsa pork for the pork burger and it was decent. I ordered this both times!
