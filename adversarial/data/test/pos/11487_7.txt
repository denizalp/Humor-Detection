On my wedding day, I had an apt to come here. I showed up 30 min before my apt and was seated to a station 30 mins after my scheduled apt. \nI had asked for eye lash, makeup and my hair just curled. I was charged more then what was asked for as prices and not only did the hair all break from \nstrands, but my face broke out from whatever they used and lashes fell out, before my ceremony.
