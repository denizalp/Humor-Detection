Great happy hour specials with all wines at half price, appetizers at half price and flatbreads at half price.  The wine list was a full page and included all the wines; not just house wines at some places.  I have had better bruschetta at Postino's but the flatbreads were good for sharing.\n\nIf a lot of people showed up there would be a definite space problem on the inside. There is a half booth and three half booths with two chairs each in the bar area.  The bar itself is square with more than a dozen cushioned bar chairs.  \n\nOne could eat on the outside but who in his \"right\" mind would want to sit on the patio very long in the never ending summer heat,,, yeah sure, it is a dry heat but not for long...
