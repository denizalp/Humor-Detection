I got to thinking about Osso Bucco the other day.\n\nMy new Dutch Ovens brought this on, I'm kind of obsessed with braised meat right  now. What to braise, how to braise, which pot to use... must be because of the freezing cold temperatures. \n\nAnyway. \n\nA few years back my dad and the evil stepmonster (she's gone now, as in they got divorced, in their 70's, can I hear an AMEN sister?) could not stop talking about Christos. \n\nThey would talk about it all the time. \n\nIn Oregon.\n\nLike, in the middle of a nice dinner at Jake's. \n\nWeird.\n\nAlso, rude. \n\nI just chalked it up to stepmonster's name dropping mental health condition. \n\nNo seriously, she drops names all the time. ANNOYING. anyway, ahem.\n\nIt was Osso Bucco this, Osso Bucco that, Christos this, Christos that. \n\nSo, when I was down there on a visit, post stepmonster,  I made my Dad take me.\n\nIt's good stuff. \n\nI don't even eat veal. \n\nBut the Osso Bucco rocks. \n\nEverything else did, too. I liked the service, the feel of the place, and I liked the calamari, and the wine. All good. \n\nif you're in Phoenix and you want a good meal, I'd say this is one of the places to go.
