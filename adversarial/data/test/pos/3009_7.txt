I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Everyone is friendly and goes above and beyond to help you (From the front desk to PT team).  I was so incredible pain from a back injury that I am not sure how to this day I got.  My doctor high recommended this place for my PT services.  Andrew and Kristy were my Physical Therapist and mostly I had Marcus as my PT tech.  They would analysis my issues.  Watch my form and correct my forms for the exercises.  I was there for 3 x a week for over 2 months.  And I have to say, I felt so much better.  Yes, it was a lot of work but it is worth it to walk and do everyday living pain free.  Gained my independence back.   They truly do care about the clients and each other as a team there.  Definitely would recommend this team to anyone that needs PT.
