9\/3\nWalked in ten minutes before 6p.  Just in time to order a few apps during happy hour!  However, half-priced happy hour apps and beverages were very limited in number and marked with smiley faces, and they were so hard to spot on the menu!  Perhaps having only ten minutes to hunt them down exacerbated my difficulty of spotting them, but I hope the managers consider having separate easy-to-read menus printed and used.  Liked that martini-drinkers have many martinis to select from.\nTried a couple of rolls, but I can't recall much to write about except that I would probably come back to try other apps and entrees not on the HH menu, but I'm in no hurry to go back.
