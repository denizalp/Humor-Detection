Lol. I had to do it. Whenever I visit a foreign country, I just have to try the local KFC. Most Americans don't realise it, but KFC in the United States isn't remotely what it used to be. Fortunately, the Original Recipe is alive and well, here in Canada. And, in my humble opinion, tastes a little bit better than it does in Japan. However, Jamaica still holds the crown when it comes to KFC--both in terms of ingredients and overall menu options.
