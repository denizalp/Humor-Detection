Love this restaurant, food, and Nobu's passion for food.\n\nIs he a little quirky and weird? Yes. Will you wait a long time for food? Yes. Should he probably change the tagline \"fast food\"? Yes.  \n\nHe is genuinely good person, immigrated from Tokyo, and genuinely loves food, Japan and Canada - it's evident by the way he decorates the place (you'll se what I mean). Totally understand that there are 1 stars for the service, so if you are in a hurry, definitely don't come here. But the food is amazing for the price that it's at, and I give a lot of credit to any entrepreneur trying to make it and pursue his passion.
