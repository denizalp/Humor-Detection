I always remind people that I am a California girl living in Las Vegas... anything below 70* and I am in trouble! So why the hell would I voluntarily go to a place called Minus 5 (as in, degrees Celsius; 23 Farenheit)?!\n\nFor the experience, of course!\n\nWanting us to have the ultimate experience, my date treated me to the VIP package... faux fur coats, big fuzzy hats (you get to keep the hat), gloves, and a keepsake photo. It also includes 2 drinks. As we had a reservation but still had to wait in line, they also comped us a free shot and moved to to the head of the paid-but-waiting line. \n\nWe were given a quick run down of the place, a warning about cold and body temperature and alcohol, and asked to place our cell phones in a locker. We were then helped into our coats and gear and led into the ice lounge. \n\nEverything, and I mean everything, is ice. From the bench we sat on, the sculptures, the bar, the walls, the woman's bust from which a pretty blonde and I did shots (yay for new friends!)... Even the glass in which your drink is made is made of ice!\n\nIt is SMALL, so be prepared to rub elbows and be social. This is not a place for the quiet and the shy. There is a photographer roaming around taking more than enough photos for everyone (one reason for  the locked up cell phones) and you can buy some on the way out or order them online.\n\nThe service was really good, considering the small space they had for a bar and considering it was all walk-up service. No waitresses here. For a constantly busy and buzzing bar, the drinks came out fast and always with a smile.\n\nThere is music and a penguin mascot, red noses, and smiles abound. I don't think we met anyone who wasn't really enjoying their time inside this fun and unique bar. \n\nThe VIP package is $75 and you walk away with the hat, three drinks ($9 or so each), and a photo... in Vegas, that isn't bad at all. They have other packages, of course, starting at $15 for just the parka (nothing extra at that rate). There are four or five packages available, so there is something for every budget.\n\nI am looking forward to sharing this with others. A fun, memorable evening!
