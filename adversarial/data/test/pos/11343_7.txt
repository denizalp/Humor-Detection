I was surprised to see that other Yelpers thought this place was cheap.  Five dollars ($5.00) for a bean burrito is not reasonable, in my opinion.  To be fair, the burrito was pretty large, but I did not like that there was one price regardless of the ingredients.\n\nThe real reason that I am even writing a review is because of the poor service.  As soon as I walked in, this large and gruff man said, \"Whaddya want?\"  And after I ordered, there was of course no \"Thank You,\" no eye contact, no smile.\n\nPoor service is my pet peeve, no matter where it is found.  It just irks me.
