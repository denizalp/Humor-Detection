While eating at this restaurant last night, a man who we had earlier been told was the owner drunkenly approached me while my roommate and her boyfriend were outside to tell me that she looks like a bitch. He apparently thought it was funny or a good idea to insult the only patrons spending money in his brand new Mill Ave restaurant. In addition, the food was mediocre at best. The bartender who served us, however, was great the entire time. It's too bad he works for such a prick. The owner definitely lost three customers immediately, and he's sure to lose many more as the story was posted in neighborhood Facebook groups who did not react favorably to his \"joke\". I will never spend money at The Grill on Mill again, and I hope others will follow suit.
