I've had brunch here and though it's pricey, it's worth the stop. I like feeling like fine dining during brunch time, so this place is one of those places that offers that option. The eggs benedict were good, but I think they need to have a bit more extensive options for brunch. \n\nWe didn't have to wait long without a reservation due to being \"guests\" at the hotel.
