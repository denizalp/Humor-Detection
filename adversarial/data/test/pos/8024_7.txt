If I could, I'd give them negative zero stars. Dr. Hung should not even be allowed to be a dentist. He's horrible, unprofessional, and rude. I was supposed to get a root canal and he clearly saw I was tearing up because the dentists scares me and he didn't even bother asking if I was ok or if I needed some time to compose myself. He was rough when I was getting my shots to be numbed. I left that place bawling my eyes out. I would not ever recommend this crappy dentist to anyone.
