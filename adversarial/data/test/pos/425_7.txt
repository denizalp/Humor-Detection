Finally had a chance to check out this popular pizza spot in Latta Arcade.  It was a late lunch so there was no crowd and I had time to put lots of thought into my creation.  I decided on a few toppings which all looked fresh, the staff was very helpful and great to talk to.  The pizza was done very quickly which is always a good look.  For me the pizza was just ok, nothing really stood out or was special about it.  Perhaps I'll give them another try at some point, but for now I'm just not getting the hype.
