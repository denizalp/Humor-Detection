This is one of my favorite bars. Great bartenders and the food is pretty good. \nPersonally, I love the burgers, Swiss cheese on sourdough with taster tots. It's the best. They also make a great grilled cheese sandwich. \nThursday special is Beef Stroganoff and it's amazing. I crave it! \nFriday special is Prime Rib, it's pretty good, but the veggies are usually overcooked.\nChris on swing, and Hot Ritchie on grave are my favorite bartenders.
