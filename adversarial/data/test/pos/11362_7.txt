After hearing mostly positive reviews about Griddle Cafe it was time to try them out. We arrived around 11:30pm on a Saturday night during a holiday weekend and there were only a few tables with guests. We were seated immediately and began the task of picking what we wanted from the menu. There were choices from pancakes,French toast, eggs, burgers and more. We chose the bananana pancakes and the adddicted to noisella French toast.\n\nThe Banananana- three oversized pancakes that have brown sugar based bananas cooked inside the batter, served with a dallup of butter and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  The came out still hot and tasted like warm banana bread. We didn't even use the syrup that was on the table, no need.\n\nAddicted to noisella - two  pices of their \"moms French toast\" with that beautiful chocolate hazelnut spread in between topped wth a  large dose of whipped cream. The whipped cream started melting from the warm French toast and and served as a sauce. The Nutella stated perfectly warm throughout the meal and every bite was quite satisfying.\n\nService was on point. Our drinks were always kept fresh and extra napkins came to our table just in time without having to ask, yes we were messy.\n\nThe food portions are enormous so look to share or be ready for leftovers. With their 24\/7 hours I will definitely come here to eat again.
