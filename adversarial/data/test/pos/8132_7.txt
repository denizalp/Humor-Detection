This AYCE sushi restaurant could only exist in my dreams!\n\nI visited on a Tuesday for lunch and my friend and I ate all the delicious, freshly prepared sushi we could for an unbelievably inexpensive price!\n\nTuna, Yellowtail, Eel, Salmon Eggs, clam, and many others.\n\nAlso beer was buy one, get one free!  \n\nThis place is amazing! I don't much care for Las Vegas (I was in town for a convention), but I absolutely adore Sakana!
