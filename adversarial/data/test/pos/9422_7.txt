I'm disappointed in myself for not getting dessert or iced coffee, but i needed room for food. I think that should be an entire separate trip because the food was too good to stop myself. \n\nI even got to spot a little local celeb while there. Mr. Bianco himself. I tried to be sly and peek at what he was eating so that I could order it. You know it's good if he's eating it, right?! All I could tell was that it was a pressed sandwich for anyone curious. And I think he caught on to me being ridiculous because he started smiling. Or he wants to date me, in which case HAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY ;)\n\nDuring my wonderful trip to Liberty I got to taste the hummus, sweet potato salad, pizza, the picnic sandwich, and the caprese sandwich.\n\nfirst things first, i am going to spend now until november trying to make  that sweet potato salad. it was insanity. It was roasted and I could taste the garlic and there were craisins and oh my gosh. I need to figure out how to make it so that I can take credit for it at thanksgiving dinner. with respect to liberty of course :)\n\nsecond- how the heck can i pick a favorite between balsamic drizzled bread with ripe, red tomatoes, tons of fresh basil, divine mozarella or the turkey with bleu cheese crumbles, granny apple slices, and candied pecans? both sandwiches were so amazing. my eating companion and i decided that the caprese sandwich was the winner. so amazing. but that doesn't discount how awesome the picnic is, because that is amazing in it's own right. \n\ni've already figured out my next trip. instead of ordering two entrees and switching halves with the other diner, we will order and split only one entree, one side and then we will have room for dessert. \n\nor i'll just go in and order a ton of desserts. whatever.
