THE WORST HOTEL ON THE DOWNTOWN STRIP.  Stayed at the fremont for the first time via Vacations Hawaii for our second visit to Las Vegas. First, the room was terrible. The hot water sink handle was loose and broke off while we were staying there. The AC button was also loose and was actually broken too!! The towel rack in the bathroom was nearly hanging off the wall and slanted. The tile around the bath tube on the wall was also peeling from water damage. Also, the shower would pulsate warm to HOT. Let's just say the quality of the room was TERRIBLE and GHETTO. \nSpeaking of the casino, our first night the backage boy left our hotel room wide open!! And who knows how long that door stayed open. The bar by the front of the doors had the rudest bartenders. \nBetting at the casino was also terrible. The dealers were absolutely rude,especially this lady named Yeishi. She not only singled me out while playing at the black jack table but straight up said \"You dont know how to play\". \nOverall, the Fremont sucked. We are definitely staying at the California or any other lovely casion with workers who dont harass their guest.
