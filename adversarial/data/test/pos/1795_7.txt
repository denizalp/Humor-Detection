Ok for those who know me, I'm a big fan of movies...especially downloading illegal and illicit copies. Just so I can stick it to the man. When this bluish monstrosity opened up, I was curious. ALL DIGITAL....WTF...I was there. Sure tickets cost more. When you're ordering food. It's from FLATSCREEN TVs... The seats are comfortable, it's very comfortable. The movies, clear and crisp with a great sound system. The bathrooms...remind me of the Great Pumpkin's insides. Yea just trust me...if you don't mind being in the Clockwork Orange.....then pee in a cup.
