Truly amazing show, and I feel redundant to repeat what most yelpers have to say. I'm a monster Cirque fan, and have seen most of the shows, so I was excited to see this one since Franco Dragone directed this production also. (Franco directed both O and Mystere) \n\nI love that this theater is arranged so well, there simply isn't a bad seat in the house. Unless you love champagne, and realize after you're seated there are seats towards the back that serve you champagne --- then you might consider your champagne-less seat, well .... bad. \n\nThe choreography, the stunts, the entire show was truly breathtaking ... perhaps my age is catching up with me, but at times the show was overwhelming. At a few points during the show I felt I was on sensory overload and had no idea what I was supposed to concentrate on. Overall it was fantastic, and a great show to see when in Vegas.
