Oh man. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Found this gem when I was starving and needed lunch. Props for the heaping servings included in the lunch specials and extra props for absolutely fantastic food. I like spice and the spice level is just perfect. But at the end of the day, I judge and Indian place based on their naan. This one does not disappoint!
