I've been anxiously waiting for Ocean Poke Co to open and it did not disappoint. This place is similar to most of the other poke places that have been popping up, but I feel like they had a few more options and was an overall better value than most. I went with a build your own with tofu noodles and it was fresh tasting and delicious. Since my husband and I were there during their grand opening we were brought samples of kombucha which they will have on tap and their acai bowls, both of those were very good too. Also they have a beverage bar of fresh lemonades and flavored iced teas, as an Arnold Palmer fan I love this! The staff was welcoming and very nice, you could tell they were very excited to be there. Great to have a healthy casual fresh new spot in the neighborhood!
