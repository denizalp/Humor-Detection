Our experience checked the box of every stereo typical car buying experience. We were looking for a used car.\n\nWent on the Thursday before Presidents Day to take advantage of \"Cash for Junkers\" (\"get a minimum of $4500 for your trade\") we are the original owner of an older large SUV the met all of the qualifications mentioned on the radio as, even the dipped talking at the end.\n\nI shared what our budget was and we walked the lot looking at cars that appeared to be far out of budget but was assured not to worry about that.  We found a couple cars that we liked so the sales manager got involved. He came back with a price that was 400% over budget and included a trade value of $3750. He said we did not qualify for cash for junkers because there was an accident on the car fax from 8 years ago. It was ironic that an incentive called cash for junkers did not accept cars that had been in accidents?!?! We left.\n\nThe next Sunday I saw another used car on their website that was priced lower than the cars we were looking at so we made a mistake of going back on Presidents' Day. This time our trade was worth $3000 so evidently driving 50 miles caused $750 worth of depreciation?!?! The good news is that as they were preparing their ridiculous offer we found the same car down the road with a \"no haggle price\" so we laughed at Midways offer and left.\n\nThe next day I got a call from Midway new car sale manager asking if I was still looking for a car. I told him we found one and that our experience at Midway was awful. I mentioned how much we were offered for the trade and that it dropped by $750 over three days. He was surprised and said that they were having cash for junkers and the minimum trade was $4500. All I could do was laugh it off\n\nYes this really happened!!!
