This is the perfect place to go if you're loaded and you don't give a shit about your animal.\n\nSince I am neither, I wish I'd never set foot in this horrible excuse for a vet hospital.\n\nI took my dog here because she was in serious pain. Her body would tense up, her skin would turn blue and she'd roll over onto her side in agony.  Not only did I have video of all this, but she presented symptoms to the technicians and surgeons that were on duty.\n\nWithout doing any sort of testing whatsoever, they decided she was a candidate for brachycephalic syndrome (blockage of the airway by soft palate and other tissues in the throat)  and wanted to schedule her surgery immediately.\n\nThey told me that without the emergency surgery, she would surely die. \n\nSo reluctantly, I scheduled the surgery for the next morning at 8am.\n\nRead this carefully. The quote they provided gave a range of $5,000 to $11,500.  Yes, you read that right.  ELEVEN FUCKING THOUSAND dollars.\n\nI walked to the register to pay and was nonchalantly told by the clerk \"that will be FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.\"   What? Are you fucking me? \"Yes, we require a $5,000 deposit sir. Will that be cash or credit?\"\n\nSo i took my dog and GTFO of there immediately, never to return.  And never to pay their $186 doctor visit fee. \n\nWhy won't I pay it?\n\nWell, the next day I phoned several other surgical facilities and was quoted much less over the phone.  Anywhere from $2000 to $4000 on the high end.  \n\nOur second opinion included a cardio and neuro exam.  The neuro exam came back positive for a spinal issue.  There was nothing wrong with my dog's throat, so can you imagine how pissed I would be if they actually went through with the surgery?\n\nRemember, they did absolutely no testing before deciding to quote me $11,500 for a surgery that would have been completely unnecessary.\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID
