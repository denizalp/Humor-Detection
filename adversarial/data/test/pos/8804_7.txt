Oddly enough, I came here twice in two days after driving past it for months on end. Sometimes you just need Italian, I guess. \n\nThe first time was near the end of the night on a Thursday. I ordered the sausage parm sandwich. I expected a whole sausage on a bun, with cheese and sauce. Instead, I got a bit of sliced up sausage with cheese and lots of sauce on a giant bun. I ripped open the bun, laid the two sides flat, and evened out the insides on it. I basically had french bread pizzas. Not exactly what I'd wanted, but it was fine. \n\nThe next day, my coworkers decided to go to lunch here, so I thought I'd give the slices a try. Those were solid. Two slices of pepperoni pizza, which filled me up and were on special. Good deal. \n\nBoth times, the servers weren't very attentive. At the lunch, I waited 20 minutes for the server to walk by before I finally got up and handed him my card. He seemed overwhelmed, but there were only two other tables with people in there. \n\nI'm down to come back regardless. I like pizza and their wing prices don't look so bad either.
