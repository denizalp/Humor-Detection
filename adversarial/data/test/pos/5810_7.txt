[LOCATION] - 4\/5\nThis place is located at the First Markham Place plaza on Hwy 7 and Rodick Rd.  \n\n[SERVICE] - 4\/5\nService was good. Our orders were all correct, but the servers didn't really interact with us to create a more personable experience. \n\n[DÃ‰COR] - 5\/5 \nVery comfortable, romantic, and a great place for lunch & dinner. \n\n[QUALITY] - 4\/5\nPretty high quality for an AYCE sushi place. Sashimi was fresh, and their torched sashimi was unique and added a nice smoky flavour to your choice of sashimi.  \n\n[ORDER] - 4\/5\nAll-You-Can-Eat Weekend Dinner - $33.99: a little pricey but worth the price because this is one of the highest quality AYCE spots in Markham. My favourite items were the torched sushis. Each one tasted fresh and very flavourful. \n\n[OVERALL] - 4\/5\nI would definitely recommend this place because this is one of the best spots for a more high-end AYCE sushi experience in Markham!
