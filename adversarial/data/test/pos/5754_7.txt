I ordered a 16\" pepperoni deep dish Chicago pizza and there's no cheese what so ever. Only sauce. When I ordered the lady ask if I only wanted pepperoni no other topping and I told her yes. I figure that my pizza should have cheese even if I didn't ask for it. The pizza isn't that good either. I was hoping that this joint would be good but I guess I tired. I will just have to wait to go to Chicago for Chicago style pizza one of these days.\n\nI stick to pieology next time in Downtown Summerlin.
