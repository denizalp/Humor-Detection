One of my fav getaway spots in Vegas :)  it's super big and chill and everyone here is incredibly friendly.  It's across from China town so away from the strip when you need a breather or two.  But only like $5-7 when you uber from the strip.  (Yes please don't drink and drive!!!  Uber is so cheap, better safe then sorry especially the way I drink in vegas lol)\n\nSo far everything I've tried here is good.  Soup, crab fried rice, yellow curry, pad thai, BBQ chicken...\n\nThe only thing I don't enjoy that much is (I'm not sure exactly the schedules) but on weekends I think I've encountered live music which since I'm not thai I do not enjoy.  But rest of time they either play hip hop or EDM   perfect for drinking w friends...our preparty spot before we head out for a crazy night \n\nOverall:  I've been here over six times now and I haven't had any issues here what so ever which to me is awesome!!!  Love the consistency
