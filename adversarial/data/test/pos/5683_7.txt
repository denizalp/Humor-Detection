Judging from the range of scores from other reviewers I think your liking of Namaste might be based on a particular preference toward Indian food done a specific way.\n\nI couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but I just didn't enjoy my meal here very much.\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was filled with HUGE chunks of dark meat chicken. I'm not usually a fan of dark meat but Indian cuisine usually gets it to really blend with the sauces and spices. This wasn't the case here - it was like tasteless brown meat dipped on sauce.\n\nMeat and veg dishes on the lunch buffet were OK, but a little odd - Paneer mixed in with a dry sort of Veg offering was a little unusual and out of place.\n\nOverall OK, but not in my first few choices for Vegas Indian.
