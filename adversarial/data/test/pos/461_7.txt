I promise to take this review down if they are defunk\/out of business, if not it stays up. Pet peeve of mine to the max. Why is it so hard to list a change in hours if you know you will be closed?\n\nSo I decided to go here for dinner over my break. I have been wanting to go since they opened their doors. I called, I checked their website and both had messages saying they were open standard hours. I drove, and it was a far drive by the way, to a closed restaurant. You would think somewhere on one of these three places (I am including the front door too) there would be a sign, a note, or some type of message saying they were closed. Anything? You obviously knew you were going to be closed so why not update the spots you give out information? Also, a full phone mailboxes a day later is really a turn off as well. I won't be back. Too bad. I heard great things.
