I picked up some donuts for the fiance's birthday this morning and oh my, were they as good as ever! This location even has a drive-thru, so you can go in your PJs and not feel guilty! We are both a big fan of old fashioned donuts and they even had chocolate ones; his favorite! YUM! This is the best place in town for homemade donuts, 100%. Since there is a Bosa close to home, I know we'll be back again in the future. If you're feeling daring, get a bear claw!! They are HUGE and delish! Happy Friday!
