Is it sad that one of the fantasies I harbor closest to my heart is to be on NPR someday? I LOVE NPR, and Charlotte's station is as good as it gets. When I'm traveling, I get really pissy when I get out of range...all NPR is good stuff, but I know when all the programs will be on my local one, and I'm familiar with all their voices.\n\nTheir coverage of local issues is top-notch, like all the recent information on the bailouts, the Wachovia failure, and the impact on our local economy. I haven't found anywhere else to get this kind of detailed, nuanced information in the Charlotte media. Charlotte Talks is awesome. \n\nThey also do a great job of covering local events. I hear more about what's coming up in the community from the little mentions in NPR than anywhere else on television, print, or online...and certainly more than other radio stations.\n\nI know I'm becoming an old lady when I don't know what's hot on the radio, but I can tell you what's hot on NPR...Sigh.
