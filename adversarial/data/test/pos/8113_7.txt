Cocktail geeks rejoice - craft cocktails exist in Vegas. I'm not sure since when, but they're here in full effect at Herbs & Rye. The elixirs you'll find coming across this bar are seriously top notch and could stand their ground against any in my favorite coastal cities such as Portland, Seattle, SF and the like. I'm so glad  to have found this spot (thanks to all who recommended it and to Misti for taking me there) and it will definitely be on my itinerary for any return trip.\n\nThis is the lest \"Vegas\" bar in Vegas,  and that's one of the big reasons I am drawn to it. No flashy BS, no gaming, no smoking, no crazy-extreme high prices on the drinks, and almost zero pretense. Nice guys making stellar drinks in a chill, subdued setting (at least when I was in there) that's free of all the glam and glitz that exists a few blocks away. Nothing against that stuff (my stop prior to this was for a delicious cocktail at the fancy Vesper Bar) but I sure do love me good cocktails minus the snoot. \n\nThe cocktails on the list are all classics, organized by the decade that gave birth to them. The list is medium-length but very carefully curated, and I found no less than three of my favorite elixers jumping off the pages and into my glass. The two drinks I sampled were a Vieux Carre (a personal fave) and a Remember The Maine (also a fave). Both were impeccable - perfectly balanced with a nice depth of flavor. High quality ingredients and trained hands sure do make some fine drinks. \n\nThe story behind the guy who owns the place is a cool one too. He started out at the bottom and made is way up to the top - self taught. I respect that. And his humility and charm is something often not seen amongst the highest level of mixologists. He's a true barman. \n\nThe food menu is hearty and tasty. I only sampled the truffled mac side fior $7 (a hearty portion) and it fit the bill. \n\nFor a respite from overpriced drinks and chaos of the strip, get thee to Herbs & Rye. You'll make up your $$ on cab fare after only a couple of drinks and you'll be so glad you did.
