Difference between regular ice cream and Turkish ice cream? It's the texture and resistance to melting.\n\nI've been craving ice creams, gelato and frozen yogurt lately. My favorite person decided to take me here to fulfill my cravings. This shop is located inside Grand Bazaar shopping center and is right next to the ticket place. There were about 8-10 different flavors and we got to sample some of the flavors before deciding on the one. \n\nGuy on the counter was extremely friendly and outgoing. He was bursting with lots of energy that I wish he'd share some with me...full-time college student over here stressed out with bazillion school work, pls help me out.\n\nI was told their Pistachio is the most popular ice cream but skipped on it since I'm personally not a fan of Pistachio. I got few samples and decided to go with Mango since I was craving some fruity flavors. Let me just tell you, it was one of a kind. Rich, bold mango flavor and it almost felt like sucking on a real mango. It was different from regular ice cream in that consistency was thicker and did not melt on a hot spring day. \n\nMy only gripe is that scoops we got were tiny for what we paid. I personally think you get more in cup than their waffle cones. Then again, we are on the strip with bunch of tourists so high price is expected. I wouldn't mind coming back again!
