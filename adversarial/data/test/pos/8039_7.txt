Wow, what a difference a remodel makes when it's done right. Major props to the design star who took this interior from shab to fab!\n\nThey now have a cafe which serves edibles such as gelato, sandwiches, baked goodies and coffee drinks.\n\nWhen my wife and I came in to cash in on an ages-old credit slip, there was a vocalist\/violinist and guitar player performing in front of the magazine rack. The singer was entrancing, which tempered my annoyance to the fact that they were blocking access to the Guitar World issues I came to peruse.\n\nThe checkout and book buying areas look fantastic. It just feels right.
