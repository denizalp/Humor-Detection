I don't like getting my hair cut. I don't like just sitting there while someone fidgets around my head. I have to fight the urge to look at my watch every few minutes when I'm in the chair.\n\nOn the other hand, my curly hair goes crazy when it gets too long. Life is about tradeoffs.\n\nThe other part about haircuts I don't like is the upselling. I know it's part of their job. I accept their capitalist drive to maximize profits. But no matter how I answer, \"so what kind of shampoo do you use?\" they look at me like I've said \"bat urine\". (For the record: Pantene shampoo and conditioner. See? Not bat urine.)\n\nGentleman Joe's doesn't do that. They don't seem to sell any haircare products, unless you count combs. So really they don't care how I take care of my hair. They care about making it shorter and better-looking. \n\nAnd they do that very well. I always get compliments on my haircuts. Maybe that's just because I no longer look like the Unabomber, but I'm still giving the guys at Gentleman Joe's the credit.\n\nAfter the haircut you get a scalp-and-shoulder rub with one of those vibrating-hand things. It's not a massage, but it's a nice touch.\n\nGuys, if you're looking for a good haircut at a good price, I recommend Gentleman Joe's.
