Came on a Saturday afternoon just as they were opening.  Beer was not that good.  Even the ones from B&B.  An older guy (whom should of not been wearing that spandex outfit) seemed to be a regular but was a lil hard to look at.  6.00 for a beer is a bit much for this place.  Its Euclid...and the beer isn't that good.  4.00 would be the sweet spot...
