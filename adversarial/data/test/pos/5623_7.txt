How did my bill come out to $60??  I thought I would be saving money!  I think they even felt bad because when I ordered an ice cream at the end they said it was on the house because it was a special day or promotion.  However I knew what I was doing and I purposely ran the price up there just so I could try their other items outside their unlimited sashimi special.\n\nLocated where the old Lucky Fish used to call home and next to such places as Cravin' Cajun, Cafe Moda, and Icy Juicy it's not hard to miss.  And as far as quality goes, they're really inconsistent.  The first day of their unlimited sashimi at the bar and I was there but I wasn't too happy with the quality so I started to throw out that I knew my shit.  Then a whole new menu opened up to me.  Then Senj became defensive with answers; ootoro, chutoro, where it came from, bluefin, big eye, albacore, Hawaii, Spain, fresh, grounded, how it comes in, if they prep it themselves, fillet themselves, etc.  \n\nAfter it's been established I knew my stuff then it got better and everything else tasted better.  I ordered an extra Uni but nigiri and truth be told it tasted much fresher.  I ordered a pair of scallop nigiri and it was a good size and tasted great.  Wish he would have asked me how I wanted it but I asked for regular and seared, same went for toro.  \n\nOne of the big screen TV faces the sushi chef, the patrons eating at the sushi bar facing east has their back towards it.  No biggie but I bought enough beer, asahi draft, to test them and they charged me for individual beers rather than charge me for all you can drink beer.\n\nThere is no lack of motivation here though, they've taken insight from me on multiple visits and I'm sure from other customers as well.  From here on out I'll just come in and eat and not ask or make small talk.  I didn't use the Yelp check in deal, I never want any business to know I'm there with a Yelp review in mind.  Senj was awesome by the way, when I went to apply the tip on my check I asked Senj if he gets portion of the tips and he said no.  I put a $20 on the bar since there were no tip jars and $5 for the waitress.  Senj took care of me pretty much all night and I hope management let him keep it. \n\nA point deducted for sanitation reasons, the all you can eat sashimi was not served on new plates when I ordered more but I kept being asked to give him my wood sushi plate.  Don't like this method, cross contamination may occur when my possibly dirty plate keeps going back to the sushi counter over and over.  And when the chef handles my plate to receive and hand back to me?  I want clean hands to prepare my sushi please.
