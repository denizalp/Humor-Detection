While it can get a bit crowded, Crepe Expectations is an excellent option regardless of which meal you have lined up. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nPrior to walking in it's helpful if you know the system at Crepe Expectations. It's seemingly always crowded, so know that you have to get in line and while you're there the friendly staff will try and line up a table for you. It doesn't always work, but they do a heck of a job keeping the operation running smoothly even in the face of lengthy lines. Kudos. Star. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nPretty much everything at Crepe Expectations sits below the $10.00, which is a real bargain given the portion sizes. I opted for the special of the day which was a Green Chili Verde savory crepe, and I ended up with a meal that probably could have fed a person and a half. Good value. Star. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nMy Green Chili Verde Chicken crepe was very, very good with fresh ingredients and good flavors that came together in the crepe, but it was my girlfriend's breakfast crepe that was truly spectacular with eggs and breakfast meats from far and wide. Two Stars. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nI'll be back to Crepe Expectations to try their array of sweet crepes, but until then I can't for sure say that I'd recommend Crepe Expectations head and shoulder above the various competitors in the area. More to come. No Star.
