Took Lyft for the first time tonight. Does not compare to Uber. No quote! Did not honor $25 off first time user coupon! Driver- Trish told us not to apply coupon before ride then told us did not apply at end of ride. Got dropped off at closer location but still charged us same estimate for further location. Stick with Uber....much more honest and economical.
