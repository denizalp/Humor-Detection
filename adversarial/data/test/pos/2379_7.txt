Ew.\n\nI grew up down the street and all I can say is ew. My friends would always come here to eat and I could never understand why. There aren't enough characters on yelp that could properly express all the bad stories I have about this place. From early in the day to night experiences, from people finding a bandages or tissue in their food to a friend of mine going into the kitchen himself to grab a pitcher of water for our table. \n\nI also could never understand why a Vietnamese restaurant had servers who are Chinese and didn't know any Vietnamese. Seriously come on, what about Vietnamese tourists? This restaurant is a disgrace to Vietnamese food and culture.\n\nService Ew.\nServers Ew.\nFood Ew.\nPeople Ew.\nWashrooms Ew.\n\nEw Ew Ew Ew Ew.
