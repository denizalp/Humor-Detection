Highly recommend these folks.  They came to our room to do my hair & makeup for my wedding.  It was great!  Daileny & Alana were friendly and fun and added a wonderful moment to my special day. They did hair & makeup for me, my mom & my sister and did it in record time.  \n\nThey arrived on time and were very professional.  If you are going to Las Vegas for a big event, call Amelia C & Co for your hair & makeup.  Worth every penny!
