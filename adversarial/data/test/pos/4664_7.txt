I really hate giving bad reviews but here it goes!\n\nThis was a place that I used to go to for the first few months that I moved to Vegas. The first couple times were a good experience. It's close to my house, the people servicing me were really nice and sweet but I did stop going here...\n\nMy pet peeve when I go to any type of spa is when the person servicing me, does what they think is best and not what I request. \n\nWell, the reason why I stopped going here was because I had asked the manicurist, who wasn't the regular person that did my nails, to not make my acrylics too thick because I don't like my nails looks like they're about to explode, they look so unnatural. She says to me \"No, too thin no good! Thicker is better.\" I hated my nails but I didn't want to be rude and spend another couple hours getting them redone. When it came time to remove the acrylics, I didn't go back there, I went across the street and the ladies there were in awe as to how thick the Oasis manicurist made my nails. They were so thick that the manicurist had a difficult time removing them. She shaved them down, tried prying them off... IT TOOK FOREVER!!! And worse part was that I started bleeding because my nails are naturally very thin and due to the thickness of the nails and the length of time that I was sitting there getting my nails removed, my nails practically ripped off and bled. EW, never again.
