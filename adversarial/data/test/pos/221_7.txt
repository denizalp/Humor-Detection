Our reservation was at 12pm and its 1:36pm and I just got my latte. All the tables around us have already received their food and we just got our drinks. The service here is seriously terrible and I vouch never to come here again unless it's in the middle of the night and nothing else is opened and as long as no one is here and I'm guaranteed my food in 30 minutes. I'm really disappointed that the service staff doesn't even care after we asked a couple of times why our food hasn't come yet and why it took 1.5 hours to receive our drinks. If I was part of management, I would feel embarrassed and maybe offer the latte or drinks on the restaurant but all they could say was that they were sorry.
