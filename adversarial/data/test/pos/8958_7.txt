My friend and I drove all the way from the far East Valley to check out this little gem for their Wednesday special (half off Bloody Marys) and we truly enjoyed our meal! We were greeted right away and treated to a cozy table where we marveled at the menu options. We were pleased to hear that another location was opening soon in Chandler. Our server Natalie was quick and efficient and made sure we had what we needed. My friend thought her biscuits and gravy was divine, but the sausage was a bit spicy and intimidating so she asked to \"trade up\" for some more of that delicious gravy. Natalie made sure to bring a generous helping of gravy right away and we were truly happy! My smoked salmon benedict and side of potatoes were really good too! Only gave four stars because I would have liked to hear more about the advertised \"Arizona's Largest Bloody Mary bar\" & when I ordered, and I wasn't given the top shelf option either. Overall the experience was pleasant and we will definitely be trying the Chandler location as soon as it opens.
