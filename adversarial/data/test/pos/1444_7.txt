Dear lord I love this place. Visiting Algebra Tea House is like falling down the rabbit hole to the artistic and inspiring coffee shop of Alice in Wonderland. In a world where I often feel like the art of good coffee shops is slowly dying, Algebra Tea House gives me hope. When you walk in, you'll be positively overwhelmed at how much you have to look at! The artistic vision here is awesome. I adore that they serve their coffee in artisan-made mugs and every detail here is really thoughtful.\n\nJust FYI if you need an ergonomic seating situation, like I do: the seating is mostly mismatched couches, floor pillows, alternative seating, etc. A good, sturdy backed chair is in rare form here. So, not 5 stars for me, only because it's a little hard for me with my injury to stay here for anything longer than a quick visit. But, the quirky seating is part of the charm here. Students will really enjoy this place.\n\nWhen I visited, the place was bustling with students that were sprawled everywhere. There was literally 1 gal working, and boy, was she working hard. I didn't order any food (I took pity on her soul), and waited about 15 minutes to get my green tea. No biggie, it's not her fault she's scheduled solo. They also sell teas to-go, which were delicious. I wanted to buy one, but they only come in really huge bags for $15, and while Kiwi Hibiscus tea sounds awesome, I didn't need that much. But, all the tea makes Algebra Tea House smell like heaven. I'll be back!
