My family loves Firehouse Subs and we are so glad to have a location now in Goodyear.  We have stopped by twice and had great customer service and the food to go along with it. You can always trust Firehouse to be a step up on its competitors. Places like Subway and Jimmy Johns do not stand a chance against the quality Firehouse puts out. In addition to their killer subs, we love the hot sauce options and especially their homemade sauce. Great food, great customer service, great place; enough said.
