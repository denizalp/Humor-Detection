Ok I've said this before. Seriously. WTF is strawberry chicken? The cook was probably sitting there. Oh Americans they like the orange chicken. Why they eat so much? Oh Mr Fried Chicken I walk with you in my hand while I think of better sauce.....oh no I trip on my shoeraces and chicken fall into my strawberry pie....wha...waaa...wait. GREAT IDEA! \nI wanna be in the chef's meeting for that. I mean really....were they having Marie Calendar's Strawberry Pie when that happened? I dunno who orders it. But whatever floats your boat. Ok the crab rangoons...Why are they double wrapped with so much wanton wrapper like they're gonna get an std? I mean seriously CRUNCH CRUNCH plus a liddo bit of crab.....Ok for really for what it is....this place is ok. It's fast chinese american food. The food isn't handled with love. It's like a short order cook dream. Lunch specials for the corporate guy\/girl on the go. It's inexpensive. For what it is...eh. Give me panda... BTW Uhm yea it was a 3. But minus 1 for STRAWBERRY CHICKEN? WTF?
