This was the first ever Ruby Tuesday's I ever ate at. The service is what impressed me the most although the food was very good. I don't like having a waitress or waiter just hanging around and every time I take a bite of food they come and ask \"how is everything\". Now it's very rude to spit out your food just to say, \"can't you see I'm trying to eat\"? \n\nHere at this place they didn't come around every 5 min., but they were always there to fill up my coffee cup and water glass. \n\nSure wish there was a RT here in Modesto.
