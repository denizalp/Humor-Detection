After clubbing at Marquee, we decided to come check out this resturant with my friends. She has been raving about this place because her sister came here and loved the food.\n\nThis place is located inside of Paris hotel. Open 24\/7 so it's a great way to get nice gourment meal instead of eatting fast food or Earl sandwiches.\n\nWe got a a hearty salad to start off our meal.The salad was good because it wasn't overwhelming with the balsamic dressing\n\nThen we tried the onion soup which wasn't that great. It had a layer of cheese on top of the soup and I had to take it off because that's was just way too much cheese. The soup was very rich and strong, but it wasn't as good as the one I had in West LA.\n\nThe mac and cheese lolipop was very creative and I did enjoy it. It came with a side of marinara sauce. My bf really enjoyed this one and I really like the concept of it as well.\n\nMy friend enjoyed his chicken and waffle. It was battery just right and cooked to perfection. His girlfriend got the angel hair pasta which was delish and full of falvor with a side of chicken.\n \nThe bf and I shared a steak sandwich which was good beacuse it was late and we were starving, but I've had better. The meat lacked on flavor and it had a huge chuck of cheese in the sandwich. I did enjoy the fries a lot because it was very crispy and addicting.\n\nFinally, we had to finish the night with some dessert because we all want some of that sugar. We got the ice cream sundae. It came with strawberry, chcolate and cookies and cream. The 4 of us could not finish it. We got defeated by the food.
