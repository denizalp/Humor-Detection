Did I pick the worst day ever to go to Yolk? Probably, yes. July 3rd. Was I the only one that had work off? No, everyone else in the world did too. It had been raining, so no outdoor seating. The people next to us had been waiting 1 hour. Our wait was 30 minutes. We had just gotten to the point of leaving when they called us.\n\nOur waiter was nice and apologetic. That did not temper the news that they were out of grits and biscuits, so our choices were limited. How does a breakfast place run out of grits and biscuits?? I did not get to try Fire in The Hole. Maybe next time...\n\nThe Mo Joe hash was very good: tender pieces of coffee marinated steak and diced sweet potatoes with two runny eggs on top. Wow! Heavenly hash! The Eggs Benedict were stellar. I had a bite of Chip and Dale - no not the Chipmunks, but the chocolate chip waffle = mmm! The Tennessee Potatoes are lightly crisped and perfectly seasoned. Nothing is average here - even the wheat toast was not your average toast - it was great and had that artisanal flavor. \n\nFor small parties there's a communal table in the middle of the restaurant - first come, first serve. The wait list can be confusing. It was self-sign in when I went. It also appeared that when people went to the community table, they didn't take their names off the list.\n\nThe food is five star in my book - I just wish they had more things on the menu I could have tried (that weren't 86'ed) - for that reason and the wait time, I bumped off a star. With all that said, I'm still a fan and can't wait to eat more of their delicious grub!
