Tsuki izakaya is not located at a great location, it's huge but there is not enough people to fill it up, just because it's in richmond hill and not a lot of people come here for izakayas or are aware that there is even an izakaya here. \n\nThe servers are really quick and friendly, and will help you right away. \nEvery time I've went, there's never been more than 2-3 other groups in the entire restaurant, making it uncomfortably quiet.\nThe waitresses\/kitchen staff all attempt to create the atmosphere though, because they yell hello when you come in. \n\nThe food has big portions, and the prices are equivalent to those portions so it's pretty worth it. I've never tried the drinks here, so can't say anything about that.\nThe setup of the food is quite nice!\n\nIt's average, and I can't say more than that.
