Came here on a sat night and paid a $5 cover at the door; it was packed. \n\nGreat live music, otherwise it would have been 2 stars. I come from the land of table minimums, great cocktails and NO cover charges. So what I don't like is waiting 10 min for service (severely understaffed) and to be told that there's no cocktail menu, and that they \"encourage people to order bottles of wine.\" Excuse me, but where exactly am I supposed to stick both a glass and a bottle, on my head? Well I've got a better suggestion for you as to where I'd stick it. My overpriced cocktail sucked by the way. Come here early when you can still hog a table for the whole night, or opt for a week day. And stick to wine, we would have, only we'd already started the night with other spirits.
