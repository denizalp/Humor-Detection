Sadly this place is no longer open because Bill's Gamblin Hall will be transformed into an ultra chic hotel like the Centurian Tower in Caesars Palace was into the Nobu Hotel.\n\nThe Cafe was one of the last cheap eats on the strip and I'd walk past it all the time and forget it even existed. My family wanted to eat here because they had an affordable chinese menu and didn't want to pay high prices lunch at one of the bigger hotels. The style of the restaurant is Victorian (1837 - 1901)  thus being called Victorian Cafe with it's stained glass windows and wood paneling. The service was just average and the food was below average, we had the lunch specials that included dessert and was just bland in my opinion. \n\nI'd come back for cheap breakfast if the place was still open but not for the below average Chinese Food. \n\n - Farewell Classic Las Vegas -
