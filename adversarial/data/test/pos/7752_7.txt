Let Hakkasan be a prime example of how NOT to design a night club in Interior Design College classes across the world. They are so lucky the promoters are grabbing the best DJ's in the world to play here or else no one would even think to come here again!\n\nHow much does this place suck? Let me list the ways:\n\n1) Too many stairs. Stairs to get into the club. Stairs to get to the bar. Stairs to get into the other room. Stairs to the bathroom. Are you serious? Make your club on a ground floor with minimal to no stairs. I got the wind knocked right out of me trying to get into the main room. It's just a bad way to start the beginning of your evening breaking a sweat trying to get into a club.\n\n2) Bottlenecked hallways and pathways. Can someone say fire hazard? I love clubs and understand that packed areas are part of the normal protocol. But Hakkasan will test your level of patience with how cramped it gets going from one area to another. And it's not even because of the club not being able to accommodate the crowd they are letting in. It's just a bad lay out and design of their hallways and how people need to get where they want to be.\n\n3) The Dance Floor or lack thereof. This club is huge and you're designating about 1\/20th of the venue to the dance floor. It just makes no sense! Especially when you have the hottest dj's in the world playing, everybody wants to be on the dance floor. Well too bad, there's too many people here and too little dance floor to accommodate everyone. So why don't you just stay cramped in a hallway or stairway somewhere cause that's what there is a lot of.\n\n4) You can't see the DJ. For whatever reason, it is impossible to see the DJ here. Once again poor design and layout of the club. The designers just did not take this into consideration when building the venue. Being able to see the DJ is an important part of the experience. Trying to get a view of the DJ is just something a person should not have to worry about. Totally kills the mood.\n\n5) Poor design aesthetics and feel. Upside down parasol umbrellas are hanging from the ceiling, blocking off lighting from the light system that should be hitting the dance floor. They just had no common sense at all installing that fixture. Bartenders and bus boys wearing ninja suits, servers wearing shanghai dresses? It's just tacky and borderline racist.\n\nCalvin Harris, Dada Life, Nervo, and Hardwell are some of my favorite Dj's and I will be waiting for their residencies to end than rather come back to this club. Not even worth to check out for a first time. Seriously! Save your money and time and go to XS, Surrender, Light, or Marquee instead.
