Bagel World at Bathurst and Wilson is an institution; a pulse-point for Toronto's Jewish community and bagel admirers from around the city. \n\nBagel World's Thornhill outpost is a cruel mockery of same; a travesty driven by sdiminished expectations and tastebuds palsied by fresher suburban air. \n\nThe bread is stale. The sandwich fillings are stale. The stale salad lolls limply on the plate.  The stale soup tastes of salt, if you're lucky.  \n\nThe service would be better if it were stale. Instead it is rotten. An attempt to follow up regarding an unsatisfactory experience yields an unprintably curt response.  You don't go to a place like this expecting white-glove treatment, but surely you can find a better bagel at a better price, sold by someone who cares to keep you as a customer nearby. \n\nThis isn't exactly a neighbourhood that's hurting for bagels, so why not support a business that deserves it? \n\nA bagel bought here is not a true bagel; it's a roll with a hole, without any soul.
