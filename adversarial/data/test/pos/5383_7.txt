I hope the rumors about them closing are true because this place does not deserve to stay open.  First let me start with the ridiculous cluster f*ck to get into the club.  Apparently no one that works for Prive has heard of this concept known as a line because instead, a mass of about 150 were outside with everyone trying to push their way to the front.  The hosts picked and chose who they wanted to let in and I saw a lot of money being handed over to bribe the hosts.  And why did they need 10 hosts at the entrance, all of whom were constantly on their blackberries...annoying.  Luckily, I was only with my sister so we got in in about 20 minutes since we were such a small group.  Once we got inside the place was pretty empty so I'm not sure why there was such a production to let people in.  Drinks were typical Vegas prices $13 for a goose and cranberry.  The crowd was whack.  A LOT of old bitches trying to look young in their tight little dresses and wrinkled raisin faces.  We stayed long enough to see Jermaine Dupri spin a couple of songs and then got out of there.  Trying to exit this place is ridiculous, you have to work your way all the way thru the crowd to the back of the club, past some dark curtains in a back hallway and when you finally do get out of the place you're on a deserted floor above the Planet Hollywood casino.  I won't be going back!
