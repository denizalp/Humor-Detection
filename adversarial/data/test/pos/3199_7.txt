Great grub, great drinks, and great servers.  Came here  on a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I did.  Ordered the cobb salad and my friend ordered the fish tacos.  The cobb salad was huge and couldn't finish it all.  My friend said the fish tacos were awesome.  They have a variety of drinks.  I tried a cocktail made with gin, cucumbers, and elderberry.   It was so good that I had a second.  They have a decent happy hour next time I'll have to try.
