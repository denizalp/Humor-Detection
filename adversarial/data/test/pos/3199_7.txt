one of their sales punks trespassed though a closed courtyard gate trying to sell me their junk, claiming that the neighborhood was full of Scorpions and Ants (haven't seen either) and needed to be treated right away.  I told him that I already had a company and of course he says they weren't any good and they only do this that and the other.\n\nObviously he's never seen the other company doing my yard.\n\nWas real close to getting physical with this guy
