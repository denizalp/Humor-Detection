Based on my experiences in the other stores in the surrounding area this one was the worst.  The staff were bored and not very helpful and just completely humorless.  I got a \"you're not ready for this color\" which normally i would find funny but her tone was so dismissive that it soured everything.  I wouldn't recommend for the staff but the products are beautiful!
