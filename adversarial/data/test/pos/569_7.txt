Full Disclosure: I am a barbecue snob and my ratings for BBQ restaurants are very critical.\n\n5\/5:  City Barbecue has the best pulled pork and beef brisket that I've eaten in the Charlotte area by an LARGE margin. Both meats were exceptionally tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The pulled pork had a little bark included. I enjoyed both immensely.  \n\n5\/5:  Their collard greens were some of the very best that I've ever eaten. The pot likker in the collard greens was off the hook. There was a full serving of meat cooked in with the greens, the most that I've ever seen in a restaurant serving, and it was very much appreciated. \n\n3.75\/5:  The mac 'n cheese didn't disappoint me either. \n\n4\/5:  My piece of Texas toast was even delicious. \n\n5\/5:  My drink of choice was a tasty Arnold Palmer that I mixed at the self serve drink station.\n\nTotal Cost was $20.32. This was a little on the expensive side for lunch, but it was totally worth it. The word that kept entering my mind after every bite was \"delicious.\"\n\nThe only thing that I found missing in the food department was a smoking HOT version of their barbecue sauce. I like hotter sauces on my brisket, but they did have SIX sauces to choose from. My favorites were the \"Swine Wine\" (traditional vinegar based) and the \"Carolina Soul\" (a Lexington based sauce.)\n\nI noticed that peach cobbler and banana pudding were their everyday desserts. Both are excellent choices for a barbecue restaurant. \n\nDECOR:  There were two large screen tv's in the dining room, one with NFL football and one with LPGA golf. The decor was citified country, but I didn't mind. I noticed that there was a nice outside patio which would be great in the Spring and Fall. It was in the low 90's (F) today, so not so much in August. \n\nMUSIC:  Oh yeah, before I forget, the music that was playing non-stop was fantastic Memphis blues, which I dearly love....and especially in a barbecue restaurant. The two go together hand and glove. \n\nNEGATIVES:  All of the employees were very helpful and friendly with the exception of the young African-American girl at the register who clearly had issues with people of non-color. She was noticeably unwelcoming and standoffish. I spoke to her in a courteous and friendly manner, but she acted like it hurt her to speak to me. People with bad attitudes do not need to interact with the general public. Racism goes both ways people.\n\nOne other thing that surprised me was that their 8\/16\/17 sanitation rating was a surprisingly low 93.0%. The dining area looked spotless to me, although the barbecue sauce bottle lids were sticky. The most recent inspection showed FOUR critical demerits, the most surprising of which was an employee basically failing to wash their hands after handling their cell phone. https:\/\/public.cdpehs.com\/NCENVPBL\/INSPECTION\/ShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx?ESTABLISHMENT=179730&esttst_cty=60\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:  I didn't notice their pickle\/condiment bar until I was getting my \"to go\" refill, but it really didn't matter because I was totally stuffed. I would definitely eat here again on my travels to Fort Mill to buy adult beverages and inexpensive petrol.
