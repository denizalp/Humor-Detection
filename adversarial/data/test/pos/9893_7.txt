This is definetly a goth club. Beautiful, above-average decor, expensive drinks, please-dont-wear-that Corset Girls with their unwashed dates who secretly want, but will never get, more. I really like this place. What sold me completely? The DJ played a reeeally good mix of music. I'm old, and even I recognized both old and new stuff over the sound system. And like Sara Y mentioned, there was once a \"back-in-the-day\" for me but those days are gone: These days, I am in jeans.
