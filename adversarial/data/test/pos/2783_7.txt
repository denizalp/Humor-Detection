We arrived at 9pm, and told there would be a 2 hours and 30 minutes wait but we were welcome to go upstairs to the bar\/lounge area to have a drink while waiting.  We thought, hmm let's wait 30 minutes and see if the line situation changes.\n\nThe hostess took my name and phone number on their iPad and advised she'd text me when our spots were ready.  I say spots because this is another communal seating arrangements, meaning you won't get any privacy, the seats are stools so you won't get those nice comfy chairs that you can lean your backs on like a normal restaurant. \n\nWe waited about an hour upstairs on the second floor in the lounge area (so much for 2 hours and 30 minutes), we sat in the nice leather seats overlooking the main dining area below on the main floor.  What can I say, we enjoy people watching.  We noticed that the turnaround rate was quite fast, people weren't staying around to chit chat for some reason.  \n\nWe were sat down at a table meant for 4 people; we were the only ones there.  My gf excused herself to go the bathroom, leaving her bag on her seat.  A large group of 10 people or so were then seated immediately behind me at a table meant for 6.  Needless to say, one of the male members of that group noticed there were 3 empty seats at my adjacent table for 4.  He was like, \"are these seats taken, I'd like to use them if possible, you're here alone it looks like so it should be ok.\"  I was taken quite aback at his rude assumption I was by myself. 1st, don't jump to conclusions, 2nd, my gf's bag was in the seat across from mine, 3rd, how dare you assume I'm by myself. I said to him in a stern voice, \"Buddy, do I look like I'm the type that would come to a place like this alone on a Friday night? Look at what I'm wearing, look at my gf's belongings in the seat! I don't care about these 2 empty seats but you will and cannot take the seat that my girlfriend is sitting in!\"  With that, he promptly turned around as one of the waitresses came over.  What a d-bag I thought...\n\nAnyway, sorry for the side bar and onto the menu.  It was simple, 12 items in total. Gf ordered from the mains, the ramen with pork belly. I ordered the kimchi stew.  We also ordered the pork buns at $10 per order, comes with two($5 per bun)! \n\nThe ramen was quick to arrive within 5 minutes of ordering. The stew came about 10 minutes later and the two pork buns came about 10 minutes from the moment my stew came.\n\nGf thought the ramen noodles were rubbery\/chewy, the stew was flavorful but not the kind you want. It was salty, she could taste the MSG in it. It had a slight aftertaste. The pork belly had no flavor if not for the soup base.  Also, the bowl for her ramen was large but it was only filled halfway, aka small portions. She notes they used pickled cabbage in the broth and plenty of it. (Sounds like kimchi?) My kimchi stew arrived with a side of rice in a bowl.  First glance the stew looked spicy with a heavy orange color.  Upon tasting the stew however, it was all an illusion. It was not spicy at all, rather had a sour aftertaste. Similar to tom yum instant noodle soup but with more emphasis on sourness. It was, very, very, very tame.  Even with the bottle of hot sauce on the side that was at every table, this kimchi stew was disappointing.  Gf detected a hint of spice used in the aftertaste though, as she's sensitive to it and doesn't eat any spicy food at all. There were plenty of vegetables and pork in it, the same ones they are using in the ramen, the pork buns.  And onto the even more disappointing pork buns.  You can't really call it a bun when it's just a sticky dough roll cut in the middle, stuffed with 3 pieces of pork belly, some thinly sliced cucumber, add the same sauce flavor found in the ramen. At $10 per order, I expected more. It was such a letdown. It should been priced at $4.50 per order of two if anything.  This is suppose to be the signature dish?? Really??  Why don't Momofuku just leave the salty sauce alone, give me a salt shaker and I'll do it myself?\n\n\nI did not finish my stew as I found the more I ate it, the saltier it got which made me drink more water. Even now close to 4 hours later I find myself thirsty because of this super salty stew.  Gf was drinking a lot of water on the way home as well as she could still smell and taste the ramen broth as it was also salty. \n\nThe damage came to $46 something, I tipped 15%. The service was impeccable and friendly though, especially in the lounge area upstairs which has its own cash.  IF you order a drink upstairs, be sure to cash out before heading down to dine. \n\nFor $50 something dollars, we left disappointed and unsatisfied. Especially after all the hype surrounding this place.  We expected more. \n\nMomofuku in its current state isn't setting any standards higher than what we have already seen with the rampant Asian fusion restaurants available in the GTA.  \n\nWe will not be back to Momofuku anytime soon if ever.
