Oh how I love Pita Jungle. \n\nI go here often - this location and the Arcadia one. I have tried a few things, but I have a tendency to pick favorites and not stray from them. I LOVE the Spinach Pasta Salad (which I add chicken to). The Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus is sooo yummy. \n\nTo be honest, everything else I have tried hasn't really done it for me. I had the Lemon Chicken Artichoke Pasta Salad the other night and I just wasn't feeling it. The falaffel is good - but nothing compared to Pita House. My date got the salmon - he said it was really good. \n\nThe servers are always, well, entertaining. I feel the urge to go spend my latest paycheck at American Apparel before going in for dinner. You know, the whole 'unattractive on purpose' thing. Can't say it's a trend that I've ever been into. \n\nThe Scottsdale, Tempe, and Arcadia locations all fit the same mold. Trendy, nice little spots. However, I went to the Mesa one the other day and it just seemed a bit off. The set up is weird: seating is on one side and the bar is off in space in the opposite corner. I asked the bartender how business had been - she told me not so great.
