Ehhhh... I really don't understand the 4.5 star average.\n\nI appreciate they let you sample the meats beforehand. The steak was tender, the chicken was ok, nothing special, but the kalua pork was dry and greasy. We got one steak burrito and one chicken bowl. All the other components of the meal were very bland. The beans were bland and powdery. The rice was bland and mushy. And brown rice is supposed to have some texture and chew to it. Even the nori hardly had any of the toasty seaweed flavor.\n\nThe salsas weren't hot and they hardly put any on it. We asked for all three on our food. Thank god for the salt and pepper shakers on the table to make it edible. I also tried the pineapple jalapeno sauce they had on the table to see if it would help; way too sweet.\n\nFor the two of us and one drink set us back $18 something, and then the change for tip, it cost us $20 for what bf said was \"the worst burrito I've had in my life\". For the meats alone, I would have given two stars; meh. But for the price, the portion, and the workers just fooling around and not acting professional (server asking for more rice and one of the cooks told her to get it herself), I can't give this place more than one star.\n\nIf you're going to copy Chipotle, you better do it better than them! At least they give you a lot of food, and don't roll their eyes when you ask for more salsa or whatever. And the kicker? Chipotle is right down the street!
