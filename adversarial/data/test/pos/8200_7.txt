After hearing about the unique and sexy performances going on during dinner, we were really disappointed when the only entertainment was a rather generic jazz band with a singer, who i could not see at all (not even a teeny bit) based on where our seats were in the restaurant.  If this is going to be a caberet the performers need to move through the place, otherwise it's just hearing some loud music in the distance.  The drinks were generally good, and the small plates were tasty, but extremely overpriced (e.g., the caviar taco for $15 which was slightly larger than my fingernail...) Overall did not live up to the considerable hype. Disappointing and based on the decor and space could be so much better, I feel like something got lost in translation.
