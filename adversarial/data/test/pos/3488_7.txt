**************************** REVIEW 877 ********************************\n\n        SW Steakhouse bears Steve Wynn namesake, you would have thought the place would be top notch from food to service. I've been here a few times since the opens years ago, but this recent visit last week was a disappointment.\n\n        The service was a major let down. Our table of 6, sitting by the water show, big deal yeah? Daniel Boulud former resto was next door with the same view no?! That's what I mean. Our server has a co-server which couldn't get us the Champagne after I asked 3 times. There was at least 5 bus boys standing around helpless every time we asked for something. It was a Wednesday evening July 17th to be exact. \n\n      I've been to Vegas enough at many top restos... especially I'v been here every month this year because of business, to have this kind of service is completely unacceptable! \n\nFOOD:\n-Oysters on the half Shell - cocktail sauce, red wine mignonette\n\n- Maryland Blue Crab-cake - shaved fennel, orange, herb remoulade -  too sweet for my taste\n\n- Sautéed Hudson Valley Foie Gras - spiced cranberry, golden raisin-celery root chutney - nice and generous portion. \n\n- Torchon Foie Gras - decent, you can see I go all out because stupid California banned Foie Gras.\n\n- Beef Carpaccio - frisée, fried capers, grilled sourdough, sherry vinaigrette\n\n- BiG eye tuna Cheviche - mango-grapefruit salsa, smoked chile, avocado, sesame crackers - skip it, check out Michael Mina instead. \n\n- King crab salad - was refreshing and good.\n\n- Tomato veggies soup - this was delicious.\n\n- Gnocchi with black truffle - this was a decadent dish, rich and tasty.\n\n- Brocolini, tomato, garlic - good side dish\n\n- yukon Gold potato purée - beautifully done, should order this!\n\n-  The bone in ribeye 20 OZ was only  $58 - this is a STEAL - perfectly cook.\n\n- The 7 OZ wagyu-  $210 was totally worth it. The only option of Wagyu on the menu, really?!? Michelin Starred Alexander's Steakhouse in Nor-Cal puts SW in shame on this selection of Wagyu! With all the money in Vegas, you would expect more! \n\n- Pan roasted Sea SCallops - English pea risotto, pea vines, black truffle sauce - nicely done.\n\n          So the food was hit and miss, the wine selection was excellent, the service was miserable. We waited 30 minutes from appertizers to entree on a WED night, with no major conference in town!\n\n         Would I return, if it was my vendors pay for my meal. If it was my choice, I prefer StripSteak, Prime or Jean-Georges! Nuff said!
