Waste of money!!!! (*spoilers*)\n\nI went recently on the weekend of July 4th with five other friends of mine, four of which fell asleep or dozed off.  The show starts off on a high note but goes downhill from there.  The show consists of a moving stage that was inside a pool, which was probably the only interesting part of the show.  Sadly the pool limited a lot of the feats that Cirque du Soleil is proudly known for.  The only thing they did in this show was synchronized swimming, dives, and more dives (then a few higher dives).  If I wanted to see dives, I would turn on ESPN and watch the Olympic professionals.\n\nThe story it self was very unclear and poorly told,  It supposedly a man who gets pulled into a fantasy world and sees all sorts of fanastical dancers, an animal master with a whip, a fan dancer (who was a large black male wearing the most revealing clothes I have ever seen a man wear and was personally scarring to me. Also, if I had a kid, I am sure my kid would have started to cry),  all sorts of women who is he trying to chase\/get with, and all other things.  Sadly all that they get across every scene is just a bunch of people doing mediocre acrobatic tricks that I have seen over and over in Las Vegas.  And those other shows were better than \"O\" and also a s*&t ton cheaper than \"O\"\n\nI personally do not understand how this show has an average of 4.5\/5 stars because if I had the option for 0 stars I would put it down in a heart beat. \n\nNot only were the tricks and acrobatic performances lack luster compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows, but the comic relief in between the physical feats was as bad as they get.  For one of the transitions, the two clowns stranded on a roof of a house came down to the audience and began dancing with 2 audience members in a slow dance.  This was neither funny or impressive,  this part of the show took about 15 minutes but felt like an eternity of wasted time.  In another part of the show, one of the performers grabs an audience member (who is part of the act) and forces him to climb the highest ladder in the show to perform a high dive.  This sad actor pretends to be out of shape and take about a year to climb this ladder, and also trembles the entire way.  It was very obvious from the get go that the audience member was a performer, it was plain to see for all of my friends and the people behind us.  Anyway, he ends of falling off the diving board and performing a fantastic fail of a dive.  only to climb out of the pool and rip off his shirt to show that he is a performer. My biggest problem with this part is, why did they waste 10-15 minutes of the show to have a \"mole\" climb the ladder and simple fall down and not perform a spectacular dive.  I was about to start booing at this part of the show.\n\nThis was the biggest waste of $150 I had ever spent in Las Vegas.  I would recommend gambling away your money, eating a fancy meal, or giving $150 to a hobo as a better way to spend your money and time than to watch \"O\"\n\nAfter all was watched and thought about,  I would give this show \"O\" what it truly deserves, a big fat, ZERO.\n\n\n\nworst show ever
