At the time of this review Serra Gaucha Brazilian Steakhouse is newly opened in the P83 District across the street from Peoria Sports Complex. It differs from other Brazilian Steakhouses because it's independently owned. I haven't been to every Brazilian Steakhouse out there but I can tell you the salad bar is adequate enough but it doesn't compare to another  Brazilian Steakhouse I've been to. Everything I tried on the salad bar was very fresh tasting but I also have to add most of it was very bland. Some of the offerings were lunch meat and cheese, chicken salad, potato salad, fresh asparagus, hearts of palm, fresh beets, rice, black beans with pork.\n\nAt the table they start you off with Brazilian Cheese Bread, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Caramelized Bananas. They also offer a full bar. Then when you turn your card to green the Gauchos (meat servers) come by with offerings. On my visit the meat selection was ....\n\nGarlic Beef -too fatty for me....and maybe less than rare....I couldn't eat\nLeg of Lamb - I passed but my husband said was good\nLamb Chops - we both passed\nParmesan Pork - came at end ......passed\nFilet - mine was medium well-well done....ok........\nBottom Sirloin -   no flavor and over cooked\nBacon wrapped Filet - was told medium rare but was well done\nRib Eye - I passed but my husband thought it was extremely well done, dry and chewy\nChicken Legs - not edible......tender but way over salted (hoping this was a slip)\nPork Sausage OK ......juicy \nChicken legs wrapped in bacon....only tasted like bacon chicken inside was tasteless\nSignature Picanha Top Sirloin - VERY GOOD! Tender and flavorful delicious!\n\nEveryone working there is a team that serves you. Everyone I encountered was pleasant and helpful.\n\nI know at this time they are new and need a few more weeks to get things better.\n\nTons of potential\n2.5 stars....rounded up because they are new and have potential since the Picanha was very good.\n\nI wish them well and I am so happy they opened in this location because we don't have many nice restaurants in this area....but my review has to be honest and truthful.
