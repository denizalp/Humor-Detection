Well well well it looks like another Southern California favorite has made it here to Vegas but I'm glad it did because it is bomb! \n\nFirst of all how cool it the name the style of this place? The cool vibrant edgy and kick back feel is exudes through their decor. The owners must want people to feel excited and comfortable yet get great food at the same time. \n\nWith a fake taco truck right in the middle of Resturant and Pinches everything this taco place easily won my heart over quick. \n\nBut the tacos really do steal the show. With home made tacos fresh in front of your eyes and mouth watering meats who can go wrong. The special \"Gringo\" taco was actually really really good. A hard shell fried taco with tender flavorful steak inside and a spicy creamy sauce it was sooooo good. The lingua was also amazing and as tender as can be. The tortilla though in picture I thought it was going to be this thick doughy tortilla oh but was I wrong thin and warm with a great corn taste you can tell the difference why it's better then store bought and pre made. \n\nBurrito was good and I was glad they had that option but I will stick to the tacos cause they were amazing. They offer a HH with $2 tacos and $4 beers all night on certain night. Owner Fernando went around talking to everyone created a very friendly and inviting atmosphere. Very cool guy! Can't wait tho come back and in the beautiful new Gramercy it was neat. There is also another location at the Container park which I will have to go check out as well!
