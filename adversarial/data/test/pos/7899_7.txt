Food was great. But this is a service review. Went in on a Tuesday night, it was pretty dead. Only a few people at the bar. We played on the machines at the bar for a bit while we waited for our food. 30 min go by, and we see the waitress walk by with our plates. She drops them off to another couple. Then another 15 min. We were going to ask where our food was when we heard the conversation between the bartender and the waitress. He asked where our food was and she had a surprised look on her face saying she delivered it already. Turns out she ran it to the wrong people. We heard the whole convo, since they we're 5 feet away from us. We watched the bartender tell the chef to re-fire our food and then he returned and completely ignored us. He didn't apologize for the wait or the inconvenience, but he did a wonderful job at avoiding us. When the food finally came the waitress apologized. But she kept on apologizing. It became annoying. Every time she walked by us she would say \"I can't believe I did that, how stupid of me\". Still, not a word from the bartender. Then I decided I wanted to try a Bloody Mary, considering they have a few on their menu, and they all sounded delicious. So I order one. And what was the bartenders response, you say? He bent over the counter and rolled his eyes. Then he said to me while shaking his head, \"if you ever order a Bloody Mary after 7pm your bartender is going to hate you.\" Then he and the waitress started laughing at me. I kept asking, \"why?\" And they only kept laughing. So I eventually just gave up and got a beer. As a person also in the service industry, I was livid. If I order something from you that's on your menu you will make it. If I am going to pay for it, you will make it. And if you don't have to supplies to make it, TELL ME. Don't laugh at me and basically humiliate me. Just no. \n\n\nUnfortunately we left with a bitter taste in our mouths, even though the food was delicious. Shame.
