WARNING!!! READ THIS post before spending your hard earned money at this business who cares more about separating you from your cash than they do about providing their customers with a decent product . \nDon't believe the posts you read. They must be friends of the owners because it's very obvious that The owners believe the general public is so dumb that the product you receive has virtually zero thought behind it. No production value and just overall dull. \nUpon arriving we were told that the only room that was available was The Farewell Room, which we were told AFTER arriving is the 2nd toughest of the (4) rooms they supposedly have. Upon making reservation I was not given the option to choose a room, which shows the managements lack of care for their customers.  We were told by (JILL) that all other rooms were filled (Thur. Night ?) when In fact the parking lot was empty. Not having an option to choose a room and just told to come down with 3 KIDS in tow to try a room that has a 15% completion rate shows the arrogance\/ lack of care by the owners. \nThe room ( farewell) is just basically a bunch of boxes with locks of which you have to find the code.  Your never given any clues and b4 entering the room we were read instructions of which we could barely understand due to the tough time she had reading the instructions and the heavy Asian accent. Do the owners care if we could understand the instructions? It's obvious . The bathrooms, lobby , and locked room were filthy dirty. Again , I ask, do the owners give a damn ? No idea what the other rooms may look like in terms of decor but if the management and the decor of the Farewell room is any indication , then I wouldn't be expecting much. Please don't review this as a bash on this type of business because we've tried others and they were great. This particular business just does NOT care about you or your satisfaction and enjoyment. Beware and pass the word on this lousy & carelessly operated business.
