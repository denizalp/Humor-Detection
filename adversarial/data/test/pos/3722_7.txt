Located in the Mircle Mile Mall across from the Earl of Sandwiches is this place. It's hard to just walk by and not get thick milk shake for $6. Thick, and creamy, and creamy, and yummy and creamy. I got the very berry blast shake it was a very berry blast-like shake and creamy. \n\nBut that's not all. They have macarons too. Yah, I was still in awe in front off their gelato freezer and didn't even bother to go around and notice that there were some macarons on sale here. Luckily my friends know that I'm a macaronphile and alerted me to such macarons.\n\nThey do have 3 flavors out there: Chocolate, Raspberry and Vanilla. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/c_iQzwsTDYraPvHSKz88QA?select=6my4VxfCGHhRIOkSjkOpAg\n\nNot bad actually. It seems kind of odd for this sugar and candy store to sell some macarons that are usually found in bakeries. But hey, it's only a $1.50 per macaron and I enjoyed all three of them. I got my macaron fix. Well I continuously had several fixes during this Vegas trip. But you never know if you just need more and now I know there is another place I can get some macarons on my next trip here.
