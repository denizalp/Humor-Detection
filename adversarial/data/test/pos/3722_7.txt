The Good -- Flavorful. The crust was delishous but suffered after a few minutes from \"the Bad\". (see below) The toppings were equally flavorful and of good quality.\n\nThe Bad-- GREASY and WET. They don't take enough liquid out of the sauce and put on too much cheese. These are pizza 101 mistakes and not easily forgiveable. We won't be back. Grimaldis and Due Forni are much better options. \n\nThe Ugly -- the light blue sweater I wore looked better at the mall.
