The drawing card for the Circus Circus Buffet used to be  $4.99 breakfast, $5.99 lunch and  a $6.99 or $7.99 dinner.\nI took a group to Las Vegas and thought it would be a good CHEAP place for lunch.\nI was amazed to find out the lunch was now  $10.99 ......\n\nThere is no way this buffet is worth that......\nI know you are saying that it is 1\/3 the cost of other casino\/hotel buffets.\nYes it is , but the quality is nowhere near one third of the other hotels.\n\nA major disappointment ...... \nvery, very average buffet fare at best.\n\nWe were lucky that there was no line ....\n( perhaps that should have been our clue )\n\nShould they get two stars because they are inexpensive .....\nI think not.
