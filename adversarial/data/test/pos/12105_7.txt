Plain and simple, my experience at this fast food pizza place was horrible to say the least, the man who was making pizza's behind the counter was very angry for no apparent reason and was also very snappy with me with I was ordering my food, (my guess the owner) I ordered two slices of pepperoni and garlic knots, the garlic knots were pleasant (I'm a garlic type person it isn't that hard to please me in that category) back on topic. I watched this man cut two slices of the pie that was sitting in the window, throw some pepperoni's on it and slide it in the brick oven. Just disgusting overly greasy pizza when it didn't have to be. As a person who eats pizza often I know pizza for one isn't healthy and is gonna be greasy from time to time but these slices were grease sponges to say the least. \nVery very bad experience, I hope the owner doesn't call this place a pizzeria.
