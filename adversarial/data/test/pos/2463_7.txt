I've gotten so many pairs of pants hemmed here over the years, but I won't be coming back. I came here to get a vegan leather jacket altered, after reading here that they do alter leather (most places won't, as the fabric is prone to puncture wounds if you don't use the right tools). \n\nWhen I arrived and pulled out the jacket, the woman working in front wouldn't even make eye contact or examine my garment closely, before rudely shooing me away and insisting that they don't alter leather there and never do. I tried to show her the tag so she could see that it wasn't even real leather, but she refused to look, and instead kept jabbing her long fingernails against the hem of the sleeve and looking at her phone. Excuse you, this jacket is new. Stop jabbing your long, dirty nails at it.\n\n\"We don't do leather at all. I keep turning people with leather away.\"\n\nWhen I asked her if there was some place else I could take the jacket, she was already motioning for the person behind me to come up so she could talk to him. Um, hella rude. Also, your website says you alter leather. So who is this \"we\" you're talking about? You're the only person there, so you mean you. And clearly, you're just lazy because hemming pants is much easier. \n\nBetween them raising prices because they know that they're the only alterations place in the mall, and hiring someone rude and unqualified; I will not recommend them to anyone.
