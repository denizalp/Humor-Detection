Chef Eric is doing some special stuff in this small space adjacent to his a la carte sushi restaurant Yummy Grill. There are 8 spots at the omakase counter so if you want to experience it you better plan ahead and get reservations. I dined with friends and once seated we were treated to over a dozen courses of creative dishes made from impeccable seasonal ingredients over the course of 3 hours. \n\nUnlike places like Kabuto where the atmosphere has an almost sacred feel to it where silence is preferred, Kame is more lively with Chef Eric and his sous engaging with our party and genuinely having fun as they prepared our meal. Also, unlike the more traditional Kabuto fare, the dishes at Kame are creative and modern where multiple ingredients are used for each dish to create unbelievable flavor profiles, like Maine lobster combined with uni, caviar, black truffle sea salt, toro, and yamamoto berry. Eaten individually or together, each bite was pure bliss.\n\nOther standout dishes included king crab with torched uni butter; live uni over brown rice and hairy crab; and lobster claw with uni butter. The more minimal preparations -- the sushi -- were stellar, too. Each delicately crafted and formed or brushed with soy sauce to maximize the umami factor of each.\n\nThey may not get the press that top-tier dining destinations do, but the experience here is one of the best in the city.
