Růže Cake House is like walking into a Pinterest page. This small but elegantly decorated cake and pastry shop is located in Old Town Scottsdale, specifically down a short alley from Main Street. Nestled among the Western stores, Růže is a little treat. Parking can be difficult with limited street access, but I was able to find a space quickly on a weekday.\n\nI was here specifically for Prickly Pear Macarons. I am a prickly pear slut every time I head to Phoenix, so I had to try these. Růže has a rotating selection of themed macarons, and this visit had a lot of Halloween candy themed ones. Besides the prickly pear, I bought a Junior Mint and Candy Corn. They also have many cakes to order and cupcakes for those with a smaller appetite.\n\nThe flavors were a bit mild and underwhelming compared to many macarons I have sampled. Nevertheless, they were imaginative and done well. Visiting the location is a treat with a pure white interior and design out of a Disney movie. One of the attractive young ladies serving me was a Giants fan, so that helped too! If I had more time, I should have ordered a coffee and enjoyed the treats inside. That makes a good reason to return to Růže Cake House.
