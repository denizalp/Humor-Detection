It's really hard to give a bad review to a free tram leading to the Crystals Shopping Center and to the Grand ol' Bellagio. \n\nTram is free, it's cheap, it's timely, it's self explanatory and non-complicated. \n\nWe stayed at Monte Carlo and the tram was literally within the same building, so access was no prob at all! \n\nA great addition to those who want to rest their feel while delving into the LV strip!
