I finally got to come here and have the full experience! I got to sit up at the bar and watch the dessert experts at work.\n\nOur waiter was not friendly at all. The African American gentleman with glasses. He definitely had a stick up his butt or something. He treated us like we were poor and couldn't afford anything on the menu.... He didn't even give us water! We were the only two at the bar with no water. He was also no where to be seen. Uh bro we spent 80$ on a wine flight, 2 drinks and 2 desserts.... Obviously I can afford luxury desserts. It doesn't help that the chefs behind the counter don't know any English... I had asked one girl a few questions and she couldn't communicate with me :(\n\nThe inside of the place is super small but cute! We got the apple, and the Mars dessert which were both delicious! Our glasses of wine were delicious too... We had the port. However the wine flight was a rip off.... It was literally a baby test tube filled to the top... It was equivalent to the size of 1\/4 of a shot
