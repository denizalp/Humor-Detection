Some idiot decided to rear end me one day and his insurance company was progressive. I take my truck here to get estimated and after reading good reviews on how fast the process was, I expected it to be a short wait.\n One hour later I'm sitting here, no updates on what's taking long. I understand things take time, but if you tell me 5 minutes it better be 5 minutes. I have been waiting for 5 minutes for the past hour. \n3 stars cause they have free snacks and drinks.
