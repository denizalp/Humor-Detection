Thanksgiving Dinner - Mimi's Special 3-course meal. All except the salad and corn soup SUCKED! This was a terrible meal. \n\nThe veggies -- carrots and broccoli -- were inedible. They were microwave bagged crap. My 1st serving was almost raw, the replacement was hot, hard and dry. Cardboard would taste better!\n\nNOTHING -- except the salad and corn soup -- was fresh or prepared on premises.\n\nTurkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and gravy -- A homeless shelter would server better food to its people.\n\nSHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
