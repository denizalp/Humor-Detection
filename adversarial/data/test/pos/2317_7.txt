Go where the locals dine! And Nora's is where the locals dine...and in droves!!!\n\nNora's is a legit restaurant that has been serving huge plates of tasty pasta since 1991 ( that's a long time in Vegas land). \n\nThey have moved from their original strip mall location to a much larger free standing building. The new location is gorgeous with lovely wood floors , modern light fixtures, outside dinning ( at 105 degrees we opted out of that!), a very lovely large bar.\n\nWe did not have reservations and had to wait an hour...but it was worth it. My tip to you on this is to come in after the first rush around 7 and it should be less hectic.\n\nGreat appetizers: free garlic bread, wonderful done calamari, mozzarella sticks, a very solid Cesar salad ( somewhat pedestrian but okay).\n\nThe menu has something for everyone: great gnocchi, fantastic lasagna ( layered with light al dente  pasta, bechamel cream,  tomato sauce and rich cheese), hearty wild boar  pappardelle, lovely linguini with either shrimp scampi or salmon.....even their classic cheese pizza is pretty darn good.\n\nThe meat and fish dishes also looked fantastic although we did not partake.\n\nNice and extensive wine list ( nothing crazy but good solid pics). Two of us had a Chianti Classico and it was okay not great!\n\nService was impeccable: polite, efficient, and consistent. All used utensils were replaced with new. Water was filled consistently fast. Waiters checked back frequently to see how things were....and these guys are working lots of busy tables!!!!\n\nDesserts looked great but we were too full.\n\nI highly recommend Nora's for 2-10 people and feel you will have  a wonderful experience away from the strip.\n\nExpect to pay $30 for an appetizer, a pasta dish and maybe a glass of wine....and for me from San Francisco that's a deal!
