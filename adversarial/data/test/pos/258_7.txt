I walked into this coffeeshop on a weekday afternoon to enjoy some reading.  Instead, I spent most of my time carefully watching a jester-hatted man speak to himself in French while firing a toy machine gun in the air at seemingly random intervals.  Quite entertaining.  He got up at one point to order \"another hot chocolate\" and without a trace of a French accent.  Maybe he was practicing?  My latte was delicious and reasonably priced  (it was served in a G.D. popcorn bowl).  They have a fireplace in the back, free Wifi, and comfy chairs abound.\n\nObligatory Title Pun:  CULTURE vultures flock here.\n\nMenu Readability: A list of every food item ever made rests quietly above the counter.\n\nNeed to mention:  They'll bring your coffee to your table.  Like an actual restaurant!\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself:  The amount of time I will spend observing a psychopath is astounding.
