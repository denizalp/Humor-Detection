Oh boy, this was a happy find!!!! When we walked in, this place was PACKED (good sign!!) but happily we found a seat right away. Whenever we eat at Middle Eastern restaurants such as this, I always gotta test them out with my tried and true favorites, Gyro and Hummus. \n\nAnd, YES......they were both GOOOOD!! Fantastic even! Excellent flavors on the gyro, and not too greasy either. The pita was fantabulous, so soft and perfect. And the hummus? WINNING. NOW I found the best hummus in Phx, really now, this time I'm certain! ;D So creamy with the perfect about of garlic, oh, it was really divine. \nNext time I'll be brave and try the lamb tongue, (no really, when you go, read the menu, Hilarious! You'll see what I mean.......then you'll chuckle to yourself and order it next time hahahaha) \n\nService was great, super speedy, even despite the mad lunch rush. As far as the actual market goes, they had what typically middle eastern markets have, spices, rosewater, tea, stuff. We did notice that they seemed to have a lot of items from Jordan in particular.   \n\nThis is for sure my new gyro and hummus spot, and who knows, it might soon become my new lamb tongue spot too! tee hee.....
