I'm going to start off by saying that I have been to some pretty seedy fast food joints in my day... but I think this JITB takes the cake..\n\nYeah, I get that you are busy because all of the drunken ASU students romp through here each night... but how hard is it to sweep the floor, wipe the tables or clean the bathroom? Ewwwwwww!!!!\n\nNext... you were not busy, at all,  yet it took five minutes for someone to come take my order... and I was not so nicely informed that for some ungodly known reason you were no longer serving milkshakes at 855pm at night.. but you could serve me a smoothie. Ummmmm... does this make sense? Noooo.... and to add insult to injury, it took seven minutes to make the damn thing. (I know because I timed it)\n\nBTW... don't waste your $2.79 on the pomegranate smoothie. It SUCKS. \n\nAnd the worst part of all? It is impossible to go to this JITB without being accosted by the homeless hippies. \n\nUnfortunately this filth infested, artery-clogging, non-milkshake-serving-after-some-undisclosed-time establishment will continue to flourish because it is in a good location and drunk people need their tacos.
