I wanted to visit this particular location a few times before I posted a review. I love Chipotle! But this location is always slacking. Their cup lids and napkins are almost always empty. You have 4 napkin holders and they are all empty on a Saturday evening. \n\nAlso, I asked for my burrito to have salsa on the side and he didn't hear me and put it inside the burrito. And he looked a little shocked that I wanted remade. I'll still come here because it's the closest one to my house, but I hope management can guide their employees better.
