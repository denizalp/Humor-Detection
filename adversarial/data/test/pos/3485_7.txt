Great local joint that was busting with energy. All the employees were very friendly!\n\nMy wife had the chicken franchaise which she said was very delicious.  It was a full 2 pieces of chicken.  \n\nI had the grandma pizza add sausage and pepperoni.  The sauce was amazing and toppings were generous.  \n\nLove local places like this where you can tell they take personal pride in what is served.  Will definitely return
