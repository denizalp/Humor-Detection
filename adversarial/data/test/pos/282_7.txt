Fairytale Brownies (NY Chocolate Show) - Too crumbly for my taste. Eileen Spitalny and David Kravetz, did I hear right? You sold your soul to the devil for money. Over 2.5M brownies made annually is impressive. Say it isn't so that you sell frozen brownies (per Sophie M.). Callebaut chocolate is a nice touch, but frozen isn't cool in my book.\n\nPics: http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/teamfoodie\/photos\/477262
