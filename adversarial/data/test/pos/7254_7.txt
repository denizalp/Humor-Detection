I've now seen a couple of shows produced by the ATC and I must say, this is some A+ theater! Their shows are housed in the Herberger and they have a wide variety of shows; everything from To Kill A Mockingbird to brand new never-seen shows, Ten Chimneys. \n\nThe ATC chooses a small but mighty cast and most of their plays have casts of ten and under. However, you would never know it! They do a great job of portraying a variety of different characters and they keep the audience entertained throughout the performance. \n\nThe Arizona Theatre Company does a wonderful job of bringing in different productions that include everything from musicals to dramatic performances. The ATC's performances are are definitely worth checking out if you are looking for something to do one night!
