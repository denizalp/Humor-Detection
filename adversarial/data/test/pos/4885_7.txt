Cons:\n \n Long wait time outside to pass through security. Being Las Vegas, waiting outside in the summer is not an enjoyable experience.\n  Parking at the on-site parking lot is $$$. Even for downtown parking.\n  Once inside no cell phone use. If you don't have reading material, it is boring.\n\nPositives:\n  \n On my two visits here, the IRS agents have been friendly and helpful. \n\n  Modern building. Although waiting is boring, the interior is not dismal.  So the depressing factor is nonexistent.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n   Park at a downtown casino, and walk vigitantly alongside the north sidewalk  along Ogden Street that passes under the railroad tunnel. With the money you save on parking, you can treat yourself to a good meal afterwards. I recommend the Main Street Buffet.\n  \n  Try to get there by opening time, to avoid a long line outside.\n\n  Bring a good book or magazine. Cell phone use is prohibited.\n\n  Be careful filing your taxes, so that you do not end up here.
