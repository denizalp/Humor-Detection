My family has been going to this Costco for about 5 months and I have to say I'm glad we became members. Who knew that a simple warehouse store with no design would be so cool.\n\nWhat to Expect\n-Parking lot is very big BUT is not enough for the amount of customers they have. Finding a parking spot on a Saturday afternoon takes patience, a sharp eye and FIERCENESS. Once you see a parking spot do NOT let anyone else have it!\n-Store also gets quite busy on weekends, better to go on weekdays when people from far away don't have time to go. \n-Free samples are a nice touch, although the employees are notoriously slow when preparing the food samples so you also have to be patient. \n-Lines for the cash register surprisingly moves quickly because people only buy a few items.\n-They have a food counter where hotdogs, poutine, fries, pizza etc. are sold for a low cost.\n\nShopping tips\n-I mainly buy only the basics from Costco, e.g toilet paper, because it is MUCH cheaper to buy in bulk rather than in small quantities. \n-Their rotisserie chicken is to die for, it is juicy and flavourful for $7.99 (I think that was the price)\n-Their Kirkland brand is typically the same quality or better as other name brands and you'll save a couple bucks. \n-They have AMAZING steaks, not even kidding they are restaurant quality and worth the $25 for 3-4 big pieces.\n\nEnjoy your time in the brilliant no-frills store that is Costco. Be patient and realize that in the long run you will save money by buying in bulk.
