I've been traveling every week out of Sky Harbor since 2003 and US Airways is my least favorite airline. So many bad experiences, I can't name them all. I hate their change fees, the flight attendants half-ass their customer service, a low frequency of flights per day, bad baggage handling experiences, and poor customer service overall. Why is this airline still in business??
