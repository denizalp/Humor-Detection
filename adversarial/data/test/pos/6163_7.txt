Fish Fact:  Salmon is technically a white fish. It gets that orange color from a diet of crustaceans.\n\nI'm catching mad feels over here.  The quality is so fresh at Nagoya --- I swear they just plucked an avocado off a tree out back!  The cuts of fish are thick and consistent, nothing smelled fishy, and everything tasted great.  The only way this place could have been better is if they offered fresh wasabi.  Happy Hour has some fantastic deals and they even offer sushi burritos here [though they're definitely on the smaller size].\n\nNagoya Sushi is a super clean place with a modern feel.  The staff, especially Sue, are super friendly and cheery.  I do think some of the prices don't match the environment and portions but I'm willing to come back and give them another chance to bump the star to a five.  This place is 4.5 stars easily but 1\/2 stars do not exist on Yelp yet so four stars it is!
