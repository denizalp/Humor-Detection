When I first moved here in 2000 this was known as Belz mall and was the go to place for most of my shopping needs. I still think they have the best Nike outlet store around.\n\nI went to buy some work pants, so I basically knew I wasn't going any farther than the first section where Nike is located, and of course where Haggar is. Haggar has been my go to place for work pants and shorts for a long time, and they didn't disappoint with $18 pairs of slacks. I think all this Yelping is expanding my waistline so I needed some bigger pants as most of my old stuff don't fit me no more. The nice part about Haggar is the flexible waist band that allows for some growth. \n\nI also snuck in the Kitchen Connection store which has some quality items at decent prices, as well as some discount items that come in handy. I got some screens for pans so grease don't splatter, a mini dip warming dish, and some silver bowls for pre-measured ingrediants. Now all I have to do is learn how to cook.\n\nI did notice a Columbia Sportswear store where the old Burlington used to be, but didn't go in. They usually have quality stuff. Will have to check them out.\n\nLots and lots of mid-hallway vendors....almost too many. And the usual influx of tourists who don't speak English, blocking doorways and generally have no respect for their fellow man.
