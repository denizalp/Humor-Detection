Ohhoho man, I love America.\n\nI gathered two of my other, uh, \"rubenesque\" ladies to try this place for the first time. I wanted almost everything on the menu, so the best option was obviously the Lolo's Famous SoulFood Platter. There are a few ways to get it, but I did mine with the chicken fried chicken smothered in sausage gravy white sausage gravy (loaded with \"flavor\" they say), mac & cheese, string beans and potatoes.\n\nSure, I probably had more than my share of fat and salt for the week, but I enjoyed it! The chicken was the star, juicy and crispy, and there was so much sausage in the gravy, even I was stunned. The mac & cheese was good as well, so cheesy that I couldn't manage more than a couple bites (gotta save room for the chicken!). The green beans and potatoes were there to make me feel like I ordered a vegetable, but weren't very good, and the cornbread was dry.\n\nI tried a bite of my friend's waffle, and even though I've never cared for waffles, I enjoyed it.\n\nDespite what many reviewers noted as a lack of or just bad service, we were all happy with our waiter and didn't have to wait overly long for our food.
