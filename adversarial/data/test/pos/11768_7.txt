Not sure how to rate this place because Dr.Lok is a great acupuncturist he helped reduce the pain and swelling. However his assistants are not very professional nor do they keep up with standards of maintaining a clean, safe a professional environment for the patient. The suction cup that was used still has old Vaseline, when I asked if they washed these cups after she said they do, they use alcohol to clean them. I asked her why are there Vaseline on it still? She said because she just put it on the cup but funny and disgusting thing is one cup she used did not have Vaseline and the other did.\n\nWhen we were at the front desk trying to figure out the co-pay none of the assistants knew where the file was,  one of the assistant even said \"wtf\" and they were shuffling through files finally they found the rest of paper work. They are very disorganized at the front desk and is hurting Dr.Lok's business who is a great and knowledgeable acupuncturist. Might be looking for a new place for acupuncture.
