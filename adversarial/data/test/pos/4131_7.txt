Took my dog here for a dental cleaning on Thursday January 7, 2016.  This vet is located in Henderson on Warm Springs & Stephanie.  \nThe young lady who set the appointment was named Kayla and she couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  Drop-off time for dental cleanings is between 8-9am.  They do bloodwork and then begin the cleaning.  Dr. Larson performed the dental prophylaxis and called me as soon as she began to let me know that 11 teeth would need to come out.  She gave me a price quote of $653.92 and asked me if I authorized her to continue and I did.  This price included antibiotics, pain meds, bloodwork, two immunizations, mouthwash, and the extractions.  I think it's about $200-ish if there aren't any extractions however my dog is a million years old and I knew he had a lot of rotten chompers.  \nMy favorite thing about this place is they give you a call the day after the cleaning and ask how your dog is doing.  That made me feel wonderful...like they really care...even though their manager probably makes them do it LOL but either way it's a great thing to do.
