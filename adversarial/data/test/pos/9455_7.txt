Of course one of the best Shawarma in Montreal comes from a little stand in a mall. I only get the Chicken Shawarma plate here but it's worth the four stars. The meat is perfectly cooked, not too dry, with plenty of spice (and that's without the garlic sauce... you must get the garlic sauce). You also have a choice of carbs (I typically get just the potatoes but the rice is also good), and salad (I go for the mixed cabbage). On a weekday you will find yourself eating among a meat market of Dawson's finest. Great choice if you need something to eat during a trip to Winners or Canadian Tire!
