This place is the El Hefe of gyms. I think I'm the only one here without a tattoo or a tank top. \n\nEquipment is in decent shape and staff is cool, but it is rather crowded. I did notice this place is on techno overload with DJ Dbag occasionally spinning live iPod music on the stairs. \n\nBring your noise canceling headphones if the Untz untz untz bugs you.
