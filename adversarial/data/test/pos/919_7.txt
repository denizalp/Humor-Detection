I'm okay with Baja Fresh, but I don't go very often.\n\nI appreciate the salsa is fresh and kept clean. I like that the food is fresh and doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna have cardiac arrest.\n\nI tend to like Burrito Bowls and I thought it's rather weird they charge you to \"upgrade\" it.....Uh, you saved a tortilla by puting it in a container, isn't that not a \"downgrade\" ? I would think they wouldn't charge you $1.50 to do that. \n\nIt has the same amount of food in the bowl as a burrito so you didn't really get more for the price which I initially thought was the price difference. Seriously- unwrap one and throw it in a bowl and see. Sure, they add lettuce, but it's not even much. Only other \"upgrade\" available- enchilada\/wet style burrito....that makes sense since you're gaining sauce and cheese. I guess make bowls at Chipotle, do a burrito at Baja. \n\n I know, it's a small thing, but it's rather weird to me!
