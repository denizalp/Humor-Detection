Bilked out of $2000. I received premade recordings (made for other clients). When I explained they were not helping\/working, the blame was put on me (I was told it was because my mind was too weak) and I was handed a couple more premade cds. Get a good counselor, join weight watchers, do whatever you need to do, but don't waste your money here.
