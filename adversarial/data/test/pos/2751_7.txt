Because we stayed at Trump on weekdays, we were able to stay at a much more affordable price compared to staying over the weekend. When we were checking in, the front desk was very generous and upgraded us to a corner suite instead of the regular suite.\n\nThe main lobby is simply beautiful, with gold decor, crystal clear chandeliers, and pretty flowers. The main restaurant is on one side of the lobby, across from the check-in counter, and the main walkway leads you to the elevators.\n\nWhat's great (or not great, depending on your preference) about Trump Hotel is that it doesn't have a casino. The casinos are nearby (such as Wynn, Encore, etc.) but Trump Hotel stands out in that it doesn't own their own casino. Hubby and I personally liked this, because it made the hotel feel like a real luxury hotel, and also family-friendly. There was no cigarette\/tobacco smell in the air, the children didn't need to walk through gambling headquarters, and overall, the hotel seemed more high-class.\n\nWhat hubby and I both found very interesting was how there were another set of doors that led us to our hotel suite. I believe this is only for suites; at least that's how it's listed on the hotel's website. You know how there is a separate Do not Disturb sign that you can hang on your room's main door? At Trump, this was totally not the case. As you can see above, there are two lights that can come up: Housekeeping and Do not Disturb. Inside your hotel room, you can manage these settings and ask for privacy or housekeeping at your leisure. I found this very easy to use and quite efficient; you'd never lose the Do not Disturb sign because it's already built in! The technology also brings a sense of luxuriousness as well.\n\nBecause it was a corner suite, it was a bit bigger than the traditional one bedroom suites. The entire suite had a traditional classic feel to it with modern decor that made the suite feel very chic and beautiful.\n\nWhat we also really appreciated was the kitchen that the suite came with. Many of Trump's hotels are actually residences as well, so for those with extended stays, this kitchen will become extremely useful. Though it was not fully furnished with cutlery, plates, and etc. it was stated that it could be furnished to your desire upon request. All the appliances were high quality and top-notch, from brands such as Bosch, Wolf, and Sub-Zero. We didn't use the kitchen during our stay, but hubby and I both agreed that it would be very handy and useful if we were travelling with a newborn; sometimes finding a place to prepare your baby's milk and food can be troubling! No problem here at Trump Hotel though.\n\nAside from the kitchen, the bottled water and coffee available in the room were complimentary. Both the water and coffee are unlimited at Trump Hotel, as they are covered in your mandatory resort fee. When requested, the hotel will bring you more water\/coffee at your service. The resort fee, which is $32.48 USD\/night is a little more pricey than your other Las Vegas hotels and resorts, but it includes many more services for the price, including: valet parking, in-room coffee, in-room bottled water, shuttle service, pool access, fitness centre access, internet access, newspaper, phone calls, faxes, and other additional services.\n\nIn between the kitchen and the living room was two doors: one leading us to our bedroom and another leading us to the second bathroom. This bathroom was separate from the bathroom in our master bedroom. The second bathroom was fully equipped with a shower stall ready for use. The marble floors were amazing and so luxurious, and everything was so clean! I didn't know that the suites came with two bathrooms, but I was very grateful that we did!\n\nWhen hubby and I stepped into our bedroom, we were so surprised by many things, and here are just some of them:\n(1) the beautiful master bathroom\n(2) floor-to-ceiling windows that gave us a phenomenal view of The Strip\n(3) comfortable King bed - comfortable is an understatement\n(4) the high-quality closets.\n\nOur stay at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was quite short (only 2 nights), but they were some of the best times we've had during our summer vacation. Everything we needed was already available or only one phone call away. We loved our stay at Trump Hotel and would come back here in a heart beat. If you're looking for a top quality hotel, or a hotel without a casino, Trump International Hotel Las Vegas will be for you!
