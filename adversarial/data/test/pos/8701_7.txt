3.5 stars rounded up. \n\nI prefer a day spa with multiple pools of varying temps; Canyon Ranch, located in the Venetian\/Palazzo, has only one -- a jacuzzi with a large ledge to sit on & two grooves to lay in. \n\nTheir other features bumps them up to 4 stars, with my absolute favorite being the wave room. All who enter shall be mesmerized by the dome & lulled to sleep. At least we were! The other room in this co-ed section was the Salt Grotto -- soothing colors, such comfortable seats, but did nothing for my skin or well being. Conservatory is a gorgeous waiting area (see pics), I strive have a space like this in my own home! \n\nOther \"environments:\"\n-- experimental rains: shower that mimics the downpour of a Tropical Rain, a Caribbean Storm, or Cool Fog. Awesome \"thunder & lightening\" effects. \n-- igloo: not as cool (no pun intended) as other igloo-type rooms at other day spas b\/c I didn't see snowflakes falling. The freezing air & cold mist felt wonderful after spending time in the warmer rooms. \n-- sauna & steam room: par for the course \n-- Herbal Laconium: humid, relaxing, loved the heated tiles against my back. \n-- Price: $40 all day access \n\nI'll be choosing another day spa the next time I'm in Vegas, however, I really enjoyed Canyon Ranch's spaciousness, their luxurious amenities, & experiencing their unique wave room.
