Meat Market\nI have a complaint on service every time I go here.  I quit going.  Checking on my complaint in April 2014 on Yelp it seems it was removed.  Yet when I sign in to my Yelp account it is indeed listed.  What's up Yelp?  Somebody padding your pockets from Midwestern Meats?\n\nThe meat counter personnel are the rudest, slickest, people on earth.  MUCH worse than a car salesman.  Advice:  Look at the cut of meat, pay attention to the price and CONFIRM that is what you are being charged.  They WILL bilk you in they think you are not watching.  They actually attempted to charge me $2.00 more a pound for a couple of filet mignon.  When questioned, the old white haired fart (hate him) said the price was wrong.  Duh!  I don't think so dick head.  BUYER BEWARE  Preferably shop anywhere else.
