If you looking for a real sushi experience, go to Yasu. \n\nIf you just want to eat salmon sashimi till you full, there are tons of ayce places you can go to on Bloor St.\n\nI am just happy that Ouchi San decided to open Yasu. I have been to his previous restaurant Nigiri-Ya at Leaside it was good but not as good as what he is doing at Yasu now. $80 seems to be steep for \"sushi\" but trust me the experience more than worth it! \n\nFresh fish and seafood from all over the world including Japan, Europe, North America. Each fish is featured as a piece of art in nigiri sushi with just the perfect preparation method and condiments (fresh wasabi, soya sauce, yuzu salt, shiso, ginger....) \n\nProcedure: \n- watch the preparation\n- listen to the explanation\n- admire my food\n- smell my food which will further enhance my experience\n- use my hand and put it my mouth and eat slowly and just let my taste buds dance\n- making happy noises and smile\n- Repeat\n\nI was sad that I miss the fresh  Hokkaido Uni but seriously Aburi O-toro, Ankimo, Hokkaido Scallop even Mackerel tasted so good...\n\nI will be back.. I want to be back... \n\nWhen am I coming back? (let me go check their availability on Yelp reservation!)
