Vegas and buffets kind of go hand in hand. That being said, most are just okay and a little overpriced. While wicked spoon is still in the price range, their food is surprisingly really good. Lots of people had raved about it and all you would see on Facebook was how pretty the food looked. Well the food def tastes as good as it looks! It's a little more unique than the other buffets place BUT it never repeats itself and the restaurant is huge! Definitely delicious and really makes you wanna stay there for a long time.
