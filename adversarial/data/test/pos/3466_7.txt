This is my second favourite place to go for Shanghai food for a decent price.\n\nI used to love the 小龍包, but then I realized that about half a year ago to a year ago, the quality of them got worse because there wasn't any soup in them. However, they still have a wide variety of dumplings at a good price (you're looking at $5-$6 for 15 dumplings or so). When you order, you simply mark it down on a sheet of paper, \n\nOne of my favourite and HIGHLY recommended dishes is the Lion ball (A meat ball composed primarily of pork). At a fair price, it is served on the hot pot stoves inside a metal dish with veggies and yam noodles. The soup is delicious! This is a must eat everytime I visit!
