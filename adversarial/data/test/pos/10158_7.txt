On our way to Columbis,SC for business my colleague and I wanted to stop for a top notch meal. So we yelped the area as we drove down the highway. This place got rave reviews so since we are both foodies we pointed our GPS in this direction and went.\nWhat a horrible experience!! I am not sure if the waitress thought two women were not worth her time or what. We never got an amuse-bouche, had to beg for bread. We got our meal long after others who arrived long after we did. Then we decided to order one last item, the waitress' response; \"This will fill you up or do you need more?\"\nOur waitress was an older woman who looked southern european.\nNow the food- the zucchini flowers with marscarpone had so many flavors going on it was too busy. Not to mention SCAULDING hot!!!! So hot it couldn't be enjoyed.\nThe tomato bisque I ate at Applebees the day before was so much better than their pomodoro suopa. Everything was too hot to enjoy or tasteless.\nat 28-35.00 a main course the experience was lost on us. I would not suggest visiting a 2 star restaurant with 5 star prices.
