We have had Chatime in Cali and in Washington and happy to see there is one in Fabulous Las Vegas now located in the heart of Chinatown on Spring Mountain. The decor inside is bright white with some cool signage and art. I personally like the \"ICE ICE tea BABY.\" Since we have found this boba spot the wife has been here 3-4 times already. We love the variety of toppings they offer including pearl, grass jelly, pudding, coconut jelly, rainbow jelly, coffee jelly, sea salt mousse and my wife's favorite the cheese mousse. Of course you can customize the sugar and ice. Free WiFi and board games available if you want to sit with friends and enjoy your beverages. Some of the interesting flavors they have include kumquat tea, guava tea, and honeydew smoothies.\n\nTonight we had the strawberry yogurt smoothie with boba and the Chatime grass jelly roasted milk tea with boba. both drinks were great 5\/5.\n\nNice hip spot, sure we will be returning soon!
