Where's the Marble Slabs in Cleveland?  Usually there's one right across the street from a Cold Stone.  No matter - there are plenty of homemade joints in Cleveland that blow both of those places out the water.  I mean seriously... why do you need this place.  Plus come on ... it tastes like wax.  Do yourself a favor and go to Honey Hut - it's not far away.
