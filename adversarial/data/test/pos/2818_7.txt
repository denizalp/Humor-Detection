Wait time wasn't bad for a Saturday morning. Waitress was young and annoying, if she called my husband sweetheart or honey again I was considering throat punching her. The French toast was dry, the gravy was watery, but the Mickey Mouse pancake for my little guy was awesome. Not sure if we will be back, too bad too I really wanted to like this place after all that I had heard about it.
