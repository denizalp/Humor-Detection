More really should be called Less because I was less than thrilled with my experience here. \n\nI spent $19 for breakfast here and to be honest I thought I was getting a deal. They have a sign that says $35 for all you can eat all day which sounded like a good deal as well.\n\nI paid for my meal and was seated. I noticed that the wait staff only took your plates. They didn't get your drinks. The drinks were self serve which was a plus to me but a minus in terms of their tip. When you pay they ask for the tip up front- now I see why. Fortunately I wanted to tip in cash.\n\nAnyway, the buffet seemed huge but I'm guessing because it was breakfast a lot of the items were empty. What I did see was of the food items that were there, there wasn't actually much food to take. I was surprised being that I was in Vegas- the city of excess.\n\nThe food reminded me of hospital food. Not very flavorful and not very hot. Honestly, everything tastes like I made it at home. If you ever ate at my house you'd know what I mean, and that's not a good thing. There was no seasoning on anything. It was just bland.\n\nThere are many, many options to choose from on the strip and you definitely can find a buffet for this price or less that is much better. I would steer clear of More and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone anytime soon.
