4.5 stars\n\nCame across this place on yelp so my buddy and I decided to check it out.\n\nIt's a stand located near the Stratosphere with bar style seating on two sides of the shack. I'm assuming most people take carry out or just eat in their cars. I can't imagine people eating outside especially during the scorching summers. \n\nThey serve hot dogs, burgers, and pepitos (which are Mexican\/Venezuelan sandwiches). We got a pepito with pork, one hot dog with beef, an order of bacon fries, and fried oreos. I'm usually not a huge fan of sandwiches, but I really enjoyed the pepito. The bread was toasted nicely, soft but with a slight crunch, and the pork was juicy. The crispy onions added more texture to the sandwich overall, but next time, I think I'll add some jalapeno peppers to give it that extra kick. I haven't had a hot dog in awhile so that was refreshing, and the fries with bacon bits were pretty good. The only complaint I would have is that the fries weren't hot when I received them. \n\nOh and the fried oreos were really tasty. The batter was coated with cinnamon so it tasted like a churro with an oreo inside of it. Best to eat it when its hot!\n\nWill definitely be back if I'm in the area! Looking forward to trying their burger!
