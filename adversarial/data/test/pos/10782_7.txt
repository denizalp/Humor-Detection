I would give them a zero star if I could. They wouldn't let us in unless one of our friends removed his fedora, which is worn for religious purpose. We did inform the hostess of his religion and why he need to cover his head. They are ignorant and would discriminate against their guest. We were at the steakhouse the night before (which is way classier and way much expensive) and they didn't have a problem with the hat.
