so my boo (do ppl still say that? ok I should stop with that.) went to Vegas last Saturday just for the UFC fight. (go McGregor!) n he was definitely welcomed back with open arms cuz being the good person he is, he remembered that I absolutely love the cookies at Honolulu Cookie Company at the Grand Canal Shops at The Venetian. for sure he gets 10 stars for this!\n\nthe first time I had these delicious shortbread cookies was in Honolulu where these shops were on every few blocks it seemed. n every time we walked past one, I had to go in to sample some more. (sampling whore here.) at every shop, there's clear plastic boxes lined up with the different flavors of shortbread cookies. u can sample as many kinds as u want. \n\nwhen I learned they also had shops in Vegas, I always made sure to do a pit stop there to do some sampling n buying. they have all kinds of custom boxes for the amount n kinds u want. even ones which r pineapple shaped to match the cookies. so adorable!\n\nI'm munching on these as I'm writing. mmm.....just so damn good.....
