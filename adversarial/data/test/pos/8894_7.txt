I have eaten here multiple times and every visit was consistently good.  The portion size usually has me asking for a to go box when I leave.  The price is reasonable.  The place appears to be clean.  The quality of food is good.  I love their flounder.  The salad bar is simple but fresh.  I have always had great service, especially when Deanna is our server.
