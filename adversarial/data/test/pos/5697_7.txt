I'm not married...but trust me, if and when I DO get married it's going to be here.\n\nIf you have a fondness for 50s Americana this place is amazing. All the 50s memorabilia is from the owner's personal collection from over the years. Everything is authentic, the furniture, jukeboxes, lighting, signage, appliances, glassware, just...everything.  \n\nI had seen pictures online that inspired me SO much I had to stop by last night and take photos. So that's what I did. I wasn't sure if the management would be ok with that, but I figured it was worth asking.  And the owner was really helpful and sweet, despite being literally BOMBARDED with weddings to do. He took a few minutes to show me the room I wanted to photograph, chat with me, and even pose in his Elvis outfit with the authentic 50s microphone for me (those pics are going on my blog in a few minutes!)\n\nThere are about 30 different themed rooms you can choose from, the prices are reasonable, and there is a live video feed of your wedding, so all your friends and family who can't come can watch it live online. \n\nJust being there for 10 minutes inspired me to change my hair, my clothes, renovate my entire house, and do a new series of paintings. And of course there's a sign in the parking lot that says \"ELVIS PARKING ONLY\".  \n\nI guess I just wanted the world to know about this awesomeness that is the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel. So there you go...my two cents.
