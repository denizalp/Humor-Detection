Disaster! I guess I don't get the allure of this place, and my biggest complaint...one that tops very average food will probably be scoffed at.\n\nThat being said, here we go.\n\nNever, I repeat never, order the breakfast sandwich with no cheese. Apparently, that was the secret ingredient meant to hold the entire average sandwich together. \n\nImagine my shock opening this puppy to have it explode all over my car when pulling out of their drive thru. Thousands of pieces of sandwich over the car...not my belly, where an $8 breakfast sandwich belongs.\n\nCheese. It's what the Knights Templar smuggled to America to mend average sandwiches together.
