The only reviews thus far for Hertz seem to be bad, which leads me to believe that people remember to review a mundane thing like a rental car only if they had a bad experience.  Yet everyone on the planet is compelled to add to the 768 reviews for Tryst.\n \nOur experience with Hertz could not have been any better. We've rented cars many times, in many cities, so I have a good basis for comparison.  This Hertz location was great.  \nThey were sold out, but the wait was minimal.  We were upgraded two classes voluntarily and without charge.  Our car was easy to find, clean, new and nice.  Everything worked just fine.  We opted for the pre-pay fill, which means that we paid in advance for a full tank and were able to return the car without having to worry about stopping for gas.  This worked out GREAT.  We paid less per gallon with this option than anywhere we saw during our 6 day stay.\nThe check-in process took, no lie, 4 freaking minutes.  Done.  No hidden charges, it's all right there on your receipt.  They've checked the vehicle, scanned the VIN, all is good. Unless you've been in an accident or puked in the back seat, no worries.\n \nAdditionally, many reviewers seem pissed off about a credit check.  The website clearly states that if you intend to pay with a debit or pre-paid cc, they will run a credit report.  \nSo, check the details before you intend to rent a car, or deal with the consequences, people.  This also raises the question, at least for me, of HOW DO YOU TRAVEL WITHOUT A CREDIT CARD??  Seriously, how do you make airline and hotel reservations?  How do you spend more than you have in cash on big-ass handbags and shoes?  How do you end up as one of the \"When the fun stops......call gamblers anonymous\" people? How do you get taken to the cleaners at the strip clubs?  Sorry, I digress, also, I'm a bitch.  Forgive me.  Or don't. \n\nAnyway!  Hertz McCarran ROCKS.  Do not be afraid to rent a car.  Be afraid of the drivers on the Las Vegas strip.
