If there was a ZERO star I would use it.. The only thing that was pleasant about our recent 3 day stay in Dec 2013  was the room its self. Dealers snotty, no drinks served at the tables for over two hours even after pit boss pleaded on the phone several times. Don't bother talking to the food and beverage manager because ALL you hear is \" well the servers are UNION\" \nThe only other time I had this type of service experience was at Bellagio last year where I couldn't get a drink after more than an hour and recieved the same response. Hey MGM get with the program.. I'll stay downtown where my business is appreciated.
