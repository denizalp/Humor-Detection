I would've liked to have been able to review Payless Pizza...But I never got the chance to try them. \n\nAbout 90 minutes ago, I went on GrubHub, saw that Payless was very close by, and they offered delivery. I'm new in town, don't have a car yet, and I'm staying with a friend who lives literally across the street from this place. So when I ordered a 16\" Meat Lover's pie for delivery at 8pm, I figured it'd be quick. \n\nI was a little disappointed when GrubHub said the order would show up no later than an hour and 10 minutes from then, but oh, well. I kept my phone right next to me with the ringer up on case there were any problems. \n\nThen, I waited. \n\nImagine my surprise when at exactly nine-oh-nine...with ONE MINUTE to spare - I got an email saying that my order had been cancelled, and my money refunded. Why? Because Payless had evidently had \"a question,\" and they \"couldn't reach me to ask it.\" Now, remember, the driveway to their parking lot is exactly across the street from the complex where I'm staying. The pizza in question is right there on the menu, and I ordered it as-is...no special requests or substitutions. I had my phone on an end table next to me listening for a ring in case of problems. And I got the message with only A MINUTE TO SPARE that my nearly $25.00 order (including pre-paid 20% tip!) was not going to be coming after all. \n\nSo, I borrowed my roommate's car, and now I'm angrily eating Chinese food at a place up the road. All because the staff at Payless are apparently too incompetent to deliver what would have been a $25.00 order ACROSS THE STREET...But also so lax on customer service that they waited until LITERALLY THE LAST MINUTE to tell me as much!\n\nTo be honest, I'm actually kind of impressed. That's a SPECIAL level of incompetence. So, bravo, Payless Pizza. You've shown me a new low in ball-dropping.\n\nEDIT: Just double-checked the phone number and address I gave GrubHub (since \"Vin\" seems keen to point fingers and pin his failure on others rather than own up and apologize), and both are correct. \n\nIn a world of GPS and Google Maps, the fact remains that Payless would rather blame anyone else but themselves (and try to get you to believe that I don't even know EITHER my own address OR phone number) rather than acknowledge their apparent inability to deliver a pizza to an address less than a quarter of a mile away. \n\nGo ahead, Payless. Blame the customer. See how that works out for you.
