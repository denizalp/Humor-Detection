I saw people walking around with those yard sticks, and I wanted one!  So when I saw Fat Tuesday, I went in with my friends and we all got one.  They have different flavors-I got half strawberry, half pina colada.  You can also buy shots to put in your cup.  They have different sizes, but I got the yard stick for under $20.  It tasted great, but I kinda got sick of drinking it after so long.
