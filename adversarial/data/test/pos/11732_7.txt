I grew up in Scottsdale and can't believe how much this area has changed over the years. Bevvy is in the heart of the downtown entertainment district. They are a neighborhood gastropub run by Evening Entertainment Group (RnR, HiFi Kitchen + Cocktails) and one of the only licensed off-track horse racing betting pubs in AZ. I really like their spacious patio area, leather booths, wood-paneled walls and the variety of TV screens and yard games throughout the bar. They have killer happy hour prices and a food menu that includes a variety of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, salads and bowls. I've only been here for drinks but love coming here to watch sports highlights. Try one of their mules - they are delicious. If you want to channel your inner Tom Hanks and see your future, they have one of those Zoltar machines on hand (they still creep me out). Their patio area is pretty spacious and dog friendly. Only bummer for me is that they are the headquarters for the New England Patriots and that Tucson team during football season. Check out their second location in uptown Phoenix!
