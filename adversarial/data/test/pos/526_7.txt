Service at the bar was great; the food not so much. The BF and I had the LA burger and their combination of fries and onion rings. I have to admit the patty on the burger was well-seasoned and really good. Everything else was nothing special. The onion rings were the better side. The fries weren't bad but nothing to rave about either. I also had the mint chocolate chip shake, which was average, but a small portion (just a small cup) for $6.50.
