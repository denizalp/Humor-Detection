Never sign up!!!!! When I was sign up before tell them I will be moving to other state soon, so I can only do monthly . They said ok , you can do monthly not yearly . The contract was for my credit card auto Payment and I can cancel any time  ! And I didn't have my contact copy when I walk out. When I cancel it they tell me I was in 2 year contract !!!! And need pay $50 for cancelation fee!! And during cancel paper work  period I  still need pay !
