A sweet breath of fresh, uncomplicated air.\n\nWhere do I start?? We spent four blissful days here this month to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary. On a side note, how hard is it to find cards that celebrate 5 years you ask...VERY HARD. Doesn't anyone celebrate 5 years?? It's a REALLY long time!!\n\nBack to the topic. This place is a natural kind of posh. Don't come here expecting extremely luxury manicured surroundings with color coordinated Disneyland-style plantings, the newest electronics or interior design, or pretentiously snooty staff. Everyone that worked here was genuinely NICE and made our experience very enjoyable.\n\nWe were upgraded quite sweetly by one of the front desk ladies into our own little freestanding casita. It had rustic charm, again don't expect that your room will be trendy and brand new. The Boulders takes the natural beauty around you and makes sure that their rooms, their pools, their golf courses, everything reflects that same natural kind of feel. The result is a relaxing feeling that you are staying at someone's 1000 acre home.\n\nThe casita reminded me of our times in Mexico, but way nicer. The hugely plush bed was amazing... I slept like a baby on it each and every night. We didn't even notice there was a TV in the room as we spent most of our time enjoying the outdoors, having spa time, or reading by the pool.\n\nThe resort is huge, it is over 1000 acres and that means that even if it's 500+ casita rooms are filled to capacity, chances are you will hardly run into anyone, LOVED IT. There are three pools, but we spent most of our time at the Golden Door Spa pool which is child-free, silence is bliss ya'll. They also only serve organic and healthy meals, smoothies and wine there and pipe soothing spa music into the pool area. LOVED IT. They even put out your choice of sunscreens for skin protection.\n\nHuge gym with lots of classes, you can go hiking and biking here with guided tours as well, my crazy husband got up early every morning to go running around the trails. Did I mention he got lost for an hour and I envisioned wild bunnies eating his eyes? Yes please take your cell phone next time. \n\nYou WILL see lots of wildlife here. We saw a ton of rabbits, birds, geckos and lizards. I heard one guest saw a bobcat. We walked most of the times to the Spa and the Lodge, but the beauty of it is that there is always a smiling attendant to give you a quick golf cart ride to your room if you need it, again this place is simply huge.\n\nWe tried food at the Spa cafe (all organic and healthy with calories on the menu), it was extremely good. My husband loved their organic wines, expensive to the tune of $15 each. That is platinum pool service, peeps. We also ate at the Lodge for breakfast, great service, southwestern ambiance and tasty vittles.\n\nThe little details are what made this place only a five star experience for us. I made sure to save the hand-written Happy Anniversary card from the manager that we found hanging on our door one afternoon upon returning to our casita.\n\nHonestly, I can only think of one thing that could be improved...the shower head desperately needs to be upgraded. $15 at the local OSH would make this a much better bathing experience.\n\nOnly negative in a place like this is sometimes the GUESTS that frequent it. Upon our check-in, which can take some time as there are only two attendants working...one extremely rude guest kept muttering loud enough for everyone to hear about how this should be going faster, he had places to be, this was ridiculous, he wouldn't stand for it, etc etc. It made everyone very uncomfortable, even his blushing wife. \n\nThe best part was when we got to the pool about an hour later to see him lounging there drinking a tall one. Yep, places to be. We saw one or two other instances of this while visiting as well. Note to other guests...people come to this slice of desert perfection to RELAX...don't be a pretentious buzz-kill.
