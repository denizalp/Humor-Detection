Came into this place on a Saturday.  There were 2 people working in the store and NO ONE else.   One older woman looked busy though she did see us and didn't say hello.  The younger girl behind the counter didn't even acknowledge us.  Then after we were about to walk out the door, she asked us one question with no interest and no follow up.   I like to support small businesses and little did they know I actually know quite a bit about the product; I've visited and purchased from several similar stores in my travels.  This is the ONLY one I've visited where the shop attendants weren't super eager to talk to the customers.   These people looked like they would rather me leave, so I did.
