Very disappointed. Went to Rudy's today for paczki at 11:00 stood in the cold and in line for 55minute. Then a baker came out to tell us that they out of most everything and they were closing for 2 hrs to caught up. But she wasn't sure how much they could make. Running short on ingredients. Next year going to place an order ahead of time.
