I came for one directive: to find Fruli beer. Success! However, it was $3.59 per teeny little bottle. I understand it is super hard to find and they have to justify stocking it via its price, but I have seen it in bars for $4-5 per bottle and it's hard to justify buying it direct from the liquor store at this price.\n\nHuge selection of beers and wine, but that's obvious due to the number of reviews mentioning it. If I found the ever-elusive Fruli here, you can probably find what you are looking for!
