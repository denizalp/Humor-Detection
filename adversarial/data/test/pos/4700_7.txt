Just taking some typical courses here to get an associates degree. The teachers have so far been really awesome (except for the psychology ones. Surprise) . Not to mention it's cheaper than UNLV and so I can avoid that place for that much longer, yippie skippy!\n\nHowever, if you're a veteran trying to go here, I feel sorry for you. The VA department is run by a bunch of lazy morons in the National Guard and they do everything in their power to royally piss you off. They won't pay the school on time, get you booted out of classes, and then expect YOU to do all the footwork to unfuck all their mess ups. Either that or they'll overpay the school and then the VA in Quantico will demand a refund plus some extra fees for wasting their time. So if you have to deal with the VA department here, you better be on their ass every week to make sure they're not fucking your shit up, CAUSE THEY WILL.
