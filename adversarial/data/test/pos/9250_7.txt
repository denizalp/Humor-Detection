The MAC Cosmetics counter is out of control!  I came here to get color matched for a light, natural-finish foundation.  The guy who helped me was in another world.  He kept fiddling around with different liquid foundations while putting droplets of random shades in a little dish.   He then took a brush and put stripes near my jawline to try to find my perfect shade.  After about 15 minutes of toying with products and drawing thick lines on my face, I was nowhere near finding the perfect match.  Everything was either way too light or way too dark.  I looked like a Bengal tiger with all those stripes on my face, while my friend watched in horror.  \n\nThe \"makeup artist\" told me to have a seat while he rang up another customer (while handing me a cloth to remove the makeup).  He said he would come back and work on finding the right shade.  Ten minutes went by and he had completely vanished.  Did he go to lunch?  Did he go home?  Did he get abducted by aliens?  I do not know. We decided to leave but didn't want to be rude and disappear into thin air, so I told another artist to tell the man helping me that we were leaving.  She acted as if she didn't know who he was even though she was right next to us the whole time!!!  I really have no words for this counter.
