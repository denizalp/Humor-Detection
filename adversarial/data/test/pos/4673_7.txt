What you talkn'bout?  Of course this is a 5 star rating.  Okay 4.5 because I like the Blue Angels better.  But if you can get on Nellis, you should check them out.  Stop by the hangar I mean.  If they happen to be at an Air Show near you and you've never seen them in person, put it on your list of things to do.\n\nThis is as close to aircraft maintenance perfection and precision aerial discipline as it gets.
