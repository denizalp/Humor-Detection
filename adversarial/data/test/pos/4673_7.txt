We picked up our morning coffee from Lee's Sandwich at Las Vegas Chinatown.\n\nWow! That was the biggest Lee's Sandwiches place I'd ever seen. \n\nCa phe sua da ($3.95): it was a perfect cup of ca phe sua da. \n\nThe coffee was good and the service was fast. \n\nQUICK TIP: IT IS LOCATED AT THE CENTER AT SPRING MOUNTAIN, NOT CHINATOWN PLAZA. \n\n4 stars!!\n\nLee's Sandwiches is yummylicious!!
