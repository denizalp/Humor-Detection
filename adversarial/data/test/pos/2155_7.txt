Beautiful restaurant, great service, if you can get a table outside I am highly recommending it. There are a lot of trees on the property which makes the place look beautiful. They fly in fresh seafood from all over the World, so you can truly try some exotic things. Instead of a menu they bring a cart around with fresh seafood and you pick what you want to eat. The bread served complimentary was delicious. \nNice wine selection and there is a full bar as well. The place is pricey but worth every dollar.\nA must try while in Vegas.
