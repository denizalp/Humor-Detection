The level of incompetence at this hotel is unlike anything I've ever seen for a world-class hotel, or even a Motel 6. Their key card machines have been down for 2 hours. The line just to check in alone was over 2 hours. Once you get to the front desk they tell you that they've checked on your key cards for you, so they WILL work\n \nThey give me a $50 room credit for your 2 hours of time and then you lug all of your luggage and bags and everything else you've been standing in the hotel lobby with the two and a half hours (instead of enjoying the hotel that you're paying for) and trek all the way upstairs down a long-ass hallway and guess what... KEYS DONT WORK. Call the hotel ask to call security to have them come up so I didn't have to do that mile-long death March again and security tells me that there's 15 people ahead of me waiting for security. What can we do about it anyway. Nice attitude. \n\nGive kudos to the front desk for trying to help and be polite, however this entire situation is a disaster. I'm beyond pissed. Will update.
