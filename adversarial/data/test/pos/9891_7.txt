The sandwiches here are amazing. I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review. I thought I had written one a long time ago. I sing their praises constantly. My favorite sandwich is the Malibu. Hot pastrami on garlic cheese bread... are you kidding me? As if that wasn't good enough it also has avocado.... I mean seriously - this is my dream sandwich. The boyfriend likes the Surfin Cow or pig or the Santa Cruz. But he's always conflicted about trying a new sandwich. The main problem being that there are too many good choices to choose from... a great problem to have. \n\nThe place is pretty cute inside and the staff is always super friendly. I've been here several times and always receive the same great service. Parking can be a little rough if it's a busy night for one of the other restaurants in the center, so be mindful of that.
