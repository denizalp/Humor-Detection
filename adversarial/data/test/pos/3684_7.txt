Overrated.  Overpriced.  Didn't I say this for another restaurant?\n\nMallorca is often rated as the best in Pittsburgh, but dear Pittsburghers, this is a chain.\n\nI came here with a friend, looking for a place to have a nice conversation.  Surprisingly, it was loud and busy.  We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday evening, but still got a table within 20 minutes.\n\nI had the seafood paella along with two appetizers and dessert.  My share came out to be $49 including tax and tip.  The paella was huge (it actually lasted for four extra meals without going bad).  The spicy chorizo was somewhat too much for an appetizer.  The flan was moist and good.\n\nRecommended for Spanish food, but the price and the accompanying noisy atmosphere doesn't get this establishment five stars.
