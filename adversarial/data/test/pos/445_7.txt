Diggity!\n\nZia Records is like 5 minutes away from my work and for some reason I never checked it out  before.  Is this what it was like to go to an ACTUAL music store before everything went digital & downloads were non-existent?  I like it!\n\nI haven't seen vinyl records what seems like ages!  They got a ton of cool stuff here, just the musty smell of the place evokes nostalgia!  I must have walked around Zia for 30 minutes just looking at the various music\/movie\/tv stuff they have in stock!  Tons of memorabilia type stuff too!  Vinyl figures, toys, video games, lots of items from the 70s and 80s!  Like a friggin' time machine!  Back to the Future, my friends!\n\nSuper nice staff, asked me if I had any questions but left me alone so I could just wander aisle after aisle of random musical & movie offerings.  I am no DJ, but those records Zia has in stock would make Calvin Harris envious!  Not light on music tastes either, they have current trends as well as old doo wop from the 50s & 60s too!  Hip Hop, Rap, Jazz, Country, Folk, heck Zia probably even has stuff on ancient Mayan chanting!  Going to Zia is a like a visit through history, no joke!\n\nThey not only sell, they buy too!  Records, CDs, tapes, VHS, DVDs, Blu Rays, toys, memorabilia, they buy it ALL!  Got some old crap taking up space in your garage?  Bring it on down to Zia Records - who knows, it might be worth a MINT!\n\nI ended up not buying anything after my journey through the annals of time at Zia, but I would definitely come back again just to go through the stacks of music & movies.  Nice way to spend a lunch break!
