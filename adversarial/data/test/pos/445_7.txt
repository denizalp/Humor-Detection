After getting the unit home and living in it a week this is what i have discovered. The convection oven doesnt work, there was a random plug in the water heater that took us a day to figure out was even there and to remove it, the air conditioner over the bedroom has lost a bearing or something of that sorts and the back tank lever thingy that closes it worked great once, but is now jammed. NEVER BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE....and if you do, spring the extra four grand and get the comprehensive warranty they offer
