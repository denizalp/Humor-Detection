Eggslut for after clubbing, Eggslut for waking up on the strip hungover, Eggslut for a quick study break, Eggslut because I was in the the neighborhood. Breakfast food all day. \nHaving had the original Eggslut in LA, I can tell you it's just as good. Don't expect anything fancy, it's just an egg sandwich. But it will be a really, really good egg sandwich. If you don't know anything about the restaurant you'll probably order the Slut, but don't. It's more expensive than anything else on the menu and the portion is really small. But don't get me wrong, it's pretty freakin good. \nI like the Fairfax, but pay extra to add meat. The Bacon, egg and cheese is just as good though so if you spent too much in the club, maybe stick to that. \nPark in the West side elevators- direct access to Eggslut!
