Urban Turban's proximity to the Strip and airport make it the perfect pitstop before saying bye-bye to Vegas. The restaurant's decor is modern and hip with a crisp lil rickshaw sitting right in the entryway - such the perfect selfie moment.\n\nWe sat at the bar which was moderately busy around 6p on a Thursday. Service was friendly and fast. The manager, a recent LV transplant from Cali, was very cool & welcoming too.\n\nWhile the space and service were nice, the food was just okay. Starting with the good - pav bhaji was yum. The flavors were on point and the bread was authentic. I'd definitely recommend it. The not so good - samosa chaat left a lot to be desired. The chaat presentation was amazing (probably the best we've ever seen) but the flavors weren't authentic. Since it's a chaat, we were disappointed that the chickpeas were missing from the mix too. The chai masala was also just okay & could have used a better kick of flavor.
