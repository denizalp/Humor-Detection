Work required weekly visits to the Charlotte which, in turn, required me to choose from the Company's pre-approved list of hotels once every seven days. I always chose this hotel. Oh, it's nothing fancy, but I always selected this place over some of the fancier hotels on the list. Why? Let me count the reasons:\n\nFree breakfast.\nFree Happy Hour from 5-7pm (free Yuengling for the win!)\nBig, two room suites.\nRelatively close to dining options.\nHyatt Points\n\nThat's not a large list, but enough for me to keep coming back. It's not perfect. The Tvs are kind of blurry, despite being newer LCDs. Though updated and newly renovated, some rooms had unfortunate, um, stains on the carpet. Oh, and if you have an iPhone, reception on AT&T is nil. Depending on the room, I had to stand by the window to call my wife. It was enough to make me want to beat Luke Wilson with a pillow case full of quarters.\n\nStill, this is the place I always stayed so I've got to give four stars at least.
