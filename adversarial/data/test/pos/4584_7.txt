I finally got my opportunity to experience this Italian restaurant. I arrived a little early before they were serving lunch but they were happy to accommodate me. They do serve a limited breakfast selection but they have a very tempting group of inviting pastries all made in house.\n\nFree WiFi is available and they are part of the coffee passport if some of your favorite coffee places are listed on it. They have beautiful artwork and some merchandise for sale including pasta and tea.\n\nI was given the lunch menu and told to order at the counter. Once I completed that then take a seat anywhere in the main restaurant. Since it was a beautiful day they had the front windows open to give you that dining outside feeling.\n\nI wanted the eggplant Parmesan panini. I was told it was huge so I deferred ordering anything else. I was told it would take about 10 minutes to prepare and my name would be called. Not long after the man who took my order brought it out to me and asked me to pay when I leave. I thanked him and was glad this was the only thing I ordered. This sandwich was indeed very big and quite filing! It seemed a little lukewarm  in a spot or two but it was cooked through and through and I really enjoyed it.\n\nAs a matter of fact this panini alone was just under $10.00! Not bad for a sandwich this size. DiAnoia's is also featured on grubhub so that you can order in advance for either delivery or takeout.\n\nThis is a very popular restaurant and gets crowded quickly. Reservations can only be made for dinner but for me getting there right before it opened for lunch was perfect. No long waits, great food, and good prices.
