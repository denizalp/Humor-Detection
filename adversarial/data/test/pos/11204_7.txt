I was blown away by the professionalism, honesty, and friendly customer service of this place! Wow. Would give them more stars if I could. \n\nI was looking to get side step rails installed onto my Toyota 4Runner and called them this Saturday morning to find out pricing and make an appointment. They told me come by later and they could get it done, no problem. \n\nGot there around 1:15pm and was promised it would be done in less than an hour. They install while you wait and give you a coupon for a FREE drink or ice cream at the Mexican restaurant next door. I waited in the AC while eating yummy flautas.\n\nMy service was completed in less than an hour, however, when they did a final walk around to check their work, they noticed a screw was in one of my tires that was from their shop. The guy came to the restaurant to inform me and offered to get it patched at a tire shop they trust down the street, no charge. It took another half hour to get the tire fixed, and when I was checking out they gave me a discount without me even asking for one. They said it was for any inconvenience regarding the tire issue. Thank you!\n\nI paid $200 for the side rails, backed by a 3 year warranty. They look professionally installed and sleek. Plus, I don't have to struggle getting in and out of my vehicle! Lol short people problems! I would recommend this place to anyone. They have earned my trust as honest business people who do quality work!
