Love this story anyway but this location is IDEAL to get all your pre game supplies and drinks for any visits to the strip or staycation fun.. best part is that it's right in the town square area which allows for you to maximize any uber or taxi rides ... or if you're picking up your rental car stop by here then go grab some food at a nice place and head to pre game before going out..\n\nThey have great prices , fun samples and delicious variety of beers , wines and 17.99 for giant bottle of fireball but while in here I just discovered there is one right above it that is even cheaper and tastes just like it .. learned about that thanks to one of the employees ... who engaged me while I was tasting samples with Chanelle (spelling may be wrong) but I got to try a delicious Cab wine and some other tasty liquor that I ended up buying .. will upload pics later..
