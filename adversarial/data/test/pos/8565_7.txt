I stopped by here for lunch today on a bike ride through the Strip District.  The cool, windy fall weather put me in the mood for some warm comfort food, so I opted for the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster and crab bisque.  After debating about the sizes, I decided to get a small (8 oz.) mac and cheese with a Mancini's bread roll (upcharge of 65 cents) and a medium (16 oz.) lobster bisque.  I also had a small (16 oz.) homemade lemonade to go with my meal.  All of this set me back $12.20 w\/ tax--not too bad!\n\nThe soup and mac and cheese definitely put me in my warm comfort food happy place.  The flavors and textures were pretty good, but they were both a bit on the salty side.  Dial back the salt a bit, and they could be excellent.  I'm glad I decided to get the roll with them, since I used it to dunk in the soup, and it cut the saltiness of the two main items.  I'm also glad that I had the lemonade, too, since its sweetness also helped cut the saltiness.  Based on the freshness of the roll, I'll have to check out Mancini's!\n\nService was pretty friendly, so no complaints there.  Yes, it does smell quite fishy when you first walk in, as well as over by the fishmonger and down in the basement where the bathrooms are located.  However, the upstairs seating area was nice and didn't smell too fishy to me (it's possible that my nose may have acclimated by then, though.)  There is a toy of some kind that kids play with that sings the same songs over and over and over again (I never did find it, but I could hear it clearly while eating my lunch).  It would be great if it could be moved to an area that isn't as audible to people sitting in the seating area.  (As a railfan, I loved the toy train, however!)  The only other criticism I have is the use of styrofoam cups. The soup bowls are compostable, which is great, but using styrofoam for all of the drink cups cancels out any environmental benefit.\n\nOverall, this was a solid lunch, esp. given the quality:price ratio.  I'll have to stop by again sometime to try the fried fish sandwich, since that's Wholey's signature item.  If you're a seafood fan--or are in the mood for warm comfort food, I'd definitely recommend the mac and cheese and lobster and crab bisque.  It hits the spot!
