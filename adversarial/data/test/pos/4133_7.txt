If you're craving Benihana but you don't feel like being fancy, just go to Teppan Bento!  Their teppan cooked dishes are amazing!\n\nLocated on the southeast corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch, I was greeted and seated by a nice elderly lady.  Darius was the guy handling the kitchen (I knew because the elderly lady kept calling his name whenever someone placed an order or needed anything).\n\nThe interior of this place is plain, but you are going to be amazed with their menu.  \n\nI Looked at the menu with pictures on the wall and was sold on the certified angus beef bento.  The pictures looked great, so I'm hoping that the real thing is great!  They did not disappoint!\n\nIn about 5 less than 10 mins I got my hot steak bento.  You can get a choice of steamed rice or fried rice.  I figured that my bento would have enough going on, so I decided to stick with the plain steamed rice.  Other than two scoops of rice, the steak bento came with a very generous portion of steak (cut in cubes), veggies, garlic butter, hot mustard sauce, and spicy sauce.\n\nThe garlic butter was amazing!  The garlic butter had chunks of fried garlic.  The hot mustard was not too strong, but whoah....the spicy sauce was really spicy!  And if you didn't catch the spiciness the first second, it will creep up to you in a few seconds!  Spicy as hell, but awesome!  \n\nMy steak was cooked medium rare, and it came out juicy and full of flavor.  The steak is great with a bit of garlic butter and dipped in the hot mustard (or the spicy sauce....or BOTH).  Every bite was like a taste of heaven.\n\nTheir tap water is flavored with lemon\/lime (you can see the water jar full of lemon\/limes on the counter when you walk in).  \n\nThis place has me hooked!  I can't wait to go back!!
