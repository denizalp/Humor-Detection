Over 900 reviews? I was excited about trying this place.  When we walked in, I saw a few open tables but was told 15 mins wait... (It wasn't lunch or dinner time, i think it was around 3pm on Sunday).  After perhaps 5-7 mins wait, our table \"became\" available... but it seemed that particular table was available from the moment we walked in..  This place was very busy and slow service was expected.  When our server spilled a drink, she said \"that's why I brought extra napkins...\"  \n\nIf you check in on yelp, it's $3.99 for chips and salsa.  Chips were thick and I wondered if these were homemade at this restaurant.\n\nI ordered mimosa with cranberry juice. Never had one before and I thought I would try it. I think I prefer one with orange juice.  Now I know..\n\nThe burger I ordered was very big, I ate about 1\/3 of it and couldn't eat anymore.  Very huge. Perhaps I wasn't that hungry, but I thought I had better burgers before.  Perhaps it was a bad day for me.
