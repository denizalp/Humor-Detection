Great diner to stop in and enjoy hefty portions of breakfast food while you're chilling in Henderson, NV.\n\nWe stopped in on a busy Sunday morning and only had to wait for about 15 min before we were seated. They're pretty fast and efficient here, and I'm talking about the local customers not just the servers. :P\n\n-Eggs are cooked well.\n-House potatoes were BOMB diggity! I totally thought I was going to pass on these but they're like thinly sliced potatoes sauted lightly with some salt and pepper. I ate them like chips! \n-Pumpkin bread was moist and delicious as well.\n\nDefinitely a diner we will return to if we're ever in this area again. \n\nSide note: If you're sort of a \"health freak\" but you do enjoy diner food, bring your own packets of Stevia to sweeten your coffee. They only carry the \"bad sh*t\" here (Sweet'N Low or).
