I'm not even remotely concerned about going out on a limb when I say that this place makes THE best burrito in town. Fer rizzle.\n\nFirst of all, I love that there are ONLY two Mucho Burritos in all of Calgary. It ensures you don't take this place for granted.\n\nFrom the parking lot you can hear the Latino beats beckoning your name. It took a total of 5 seconds for me to cave and decide I was going to have an entire burrito...as a 'snack'.\n\nYou walk in, and the place is spacious and welcoming. All the customers have happy looks on their faces and it's clear why: they are eating THE best burritos in Calgary. Wouldn't YOU be a happy camper? \n\nFor all you Americans, picture Chipotle. For all your Canadians, picture Subway (burrito-style).\n\nI get to the front and place my order. I basically meet the entire staff through the customization of my burrito. \n\nThe staff is friendly, the ingredients are fresh, and my burrito is DE-LISH.\n\nIf you're not a burrito hound like me, then they've got Quesadillas, gourmet tacos, nachos, salad bowls and Pequenitos (petite sized servings for you amateur eaters).\n\nI LOVED the ambiance, I LOVED the music and I LOVED my meal.\n\nYou wanna get in my good books? Take me on a date at Mucho Burrito. I may be a cheap date (burrito - $4.99!), but I ain't cheap. Nothing but the best for this mamita.
