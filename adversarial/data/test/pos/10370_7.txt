Why did I rate Joe's Crab Shack 3 stars when I rated In-N-Out Burger 4 stars in my last review? Interesting since Joe's Crab Shack is a casual dining restaurant that I get to visit once in awhile as a treat whereas In-N-Out Burger is a fast food establishment that I would normally dine in. The answer is employee enthusiasm. When I spend $6 in In-N-Out, the employees greet me with enthusiasm. However, when I spent $23 in Joe's Crab Shack you could kind of say the waitress was like a crab. The waitress wasn't nasty or bad at her job. She gave me the impression that she didn't want to be there. When I write reviews, I push on customer service and cheerful employees. Attitude could make or break my ratings.\n\n  The fact that I was disappointed in the waitress's friendliness shouldn't have been. When I originally set foot in a Joe's Crab Shack in Orlando, Florida the restaurant was overflowing with a good times vibe. All the employees were friendly and at the top of the hour they'd dance. Enjoying an upbeat atmosphere over tasty seafood was my kind of scene. Joe's Crab Shack had a name for good times and seafood. It was a name that would draw me into a Joe's Crab Shack on vacation. When I moved to Las Vegas, the Henderson location lived up to the name. But in life things happened and Joe's Crab Shack disappeared from my life. On Sunday, when my brother and I were hanging out in Barnes & Noble, I was like, \"Joe's Crab Shack is a block away on Rainbow. Let's try it.\"\n\n  When we stepped foot in the restaurant,  which also sells gifts by the way; it was sparsely populated for a Sunday late afternoon. The hostess was friendly. If the waitress had had the hostess' s attitude this review would of taken a different tone.\n\n  I ordered the Big Shrimp combo. The dish featured coconut shrimp, fried shrimp, and stuffed crab shrimp with fries and cole slaw. Over the years the menu must of changed. It wouldn't be surprising since the personality of Joe's Crab Shack had. Kind of like the waitress' s attitude, the Big Shrimp combo leaves me unenthusiastic. Why? Two of the three types of shrimp were breaded. Breaded shrimp reminds me of Mrs. Paul's. And I could just walk into aisle 2 of Walmart to pick it up. Now the stuffed crab shrimp was delicious. The thing is it was tiny in proportion to the breaded shrimps and fries. In my honest opinion, Joe's Crab Shack would have been smart to follow Red Lobster's example of giving a choice of shrimps and less breaded shrimp. For the record, the fries and cole slaw was delicious. When all is said and done, the Big Shrimp Combo with a Coke and tip wasn't worth $23. \n\n   Dining out is precious. I work hard for my money and deserve to eat in a restaurant where the waitress wants to be. In reality, it will be at least 6 months until I patronize this location. Red Lobster, Bubba Gump, and lets face it In-N-Out Burger are better choices.
