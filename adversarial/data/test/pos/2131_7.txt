Excellent ideas, sustainability plans in place and clearly well executed. Definitely a Berkeley dream come true and trust me, when it comes to hippies, few people smell the hippie better than those of us out here in the Bay.\n\nThis is kinda like a strip club. Stay with me now. If the best \"dancer\" in the history of stripper poles was \"dancing\" at a club, but nobody went to that club cause it was not worth going to, would anyone know she's the best \"dancer?\" Of course not!\n\nWe were excited the night before when we saw the flames coming from the.... grass hopper? Praying mantis?? Whatever it was, it was cool. We just got done grubbing at eat across the road and wanted to check out what kind of stores were here to take our money. But here is the kicker. Crazy Legs leggings store is the best you could do? I mean, maybe cause I was in the house in January and the Flip Flop store wasn't on the radar cause it was 52 degrees midday. I just don't see how the businesses chosen were chosen to attract real money. Sure, I love some leggings and I was ready to stroll inside Crazy Legs and pickup somethin' sexy for my wife. Problem being, they were closed in the middle of the day. I know, I know. You can't please everyone all the time. If I had kids, I'd take them here to play around on the \"tree\" house and stuff, but I wrapped up in my twenties and don't have any kids. \n\nOverall, I can't say with great certainty that they missed the mark, but if you asked my opinion, I'd say with great confidence that they missed the mark.
