I got the Shrimp Pad Thai. The shrimp was rubbery and didn't taste fresh at all.  Also, $20 dollars is overkill. \n\nI didn't know that this was a fancy sit down place.  They looked annoyed when I asked for something to go.  Overpriced food, extremely small, and full of Summerlin snobs.  I don't recommend going if you're a family or want to have an experience that was worth every buck you earn.
