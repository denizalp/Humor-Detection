It's no secret that the bruthas love brandy. So when my street soldiers gave word that brandy was also a PERSON and not just liquid in da clubs, I was like, Daaaayum son! Destiny's child just got birthed in the Southside!\n\nBrandy is cool ALL HELL, and in no time she took that dirty Winnebago atop my head and turned it into a Ferrari, son!  So if you're looking to step up your hair game, or just get rid of that lice (damn these kids of mine always getting lice, SMH!), mah gurl Brandy will treat you right. -Peace
