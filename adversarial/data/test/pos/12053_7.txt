Ugh! I was just so disappointed because I was so excited to try this place out!!!!\n\nI ordered the butter chicken mac n cheese, punjabi cheeseburger, jerk chicken samosa, paneer fries and the rasmalai cheesecake samosa....basically the whole menu because I was that excited!! The flavour was all there, it tasted great!\n\nBut it made my stomach hurt whyyyyyyy. This never happens to me!  I thought it was just me but when I asked my boyfriend if his stomach was hurting too he said yes! That was all we ate that day so it couldn't have been anything else.  \n\nAlthough the food tasted great, I don't think I'll be returning.  Sorry Rick, I really wanted to like you.\n\nP.s. Shout out to the server hitting on my boyfriend while I was right beside him, I see you ;)
