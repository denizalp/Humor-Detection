$7.77 for STEAK & SHRIMP! (Not on the menu. You have to tell the waiter you want the special. And I don't know why everyone keeps talking about a player's card, because I just asked the waiter for it and he didn't check or anything.) \n\nOnly 1 reason why you should be here, and it's for the Steak & Shrimp Special! Order comes with a small salad, steak, 3 pieces of shrimp, and bomb-diggity mashed potatoes. Like, seriously it's so creamy, buttery, smooth, with small chunks of potatoes mixed in that I want to ask if I can just get a whole tub of this to go. I'm sure they use Paula Deen's recipe, when she cuts off a small piece of butter, puts it to teh side, and adds the left over big end in. \n\nNot the most amazing steak and shrimp, lets be honest. But for that price it's a steal! Especially considering how you can order this 24\/7. \n\nMr. Lucky's was super packed when we came during the lunch hour, or maybe it was because it was just a busy weekend in Vegas. Service was a bit slow, but not because of the waiter or anything, it was just so packed busy with people. He was still really nice and attempted to meet our needs.
