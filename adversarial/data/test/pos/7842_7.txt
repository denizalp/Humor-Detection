One of the best Jamba Juice locations I've been too!\n\nLocated off of S. Eastern Ave and E. Russell Rd in McCarran Marketplace shopping center, this location is ideal for those wanting some place to go and pick up something quick and healthy. I always enjoyed coming here first thing in the morning when I made my grocery shopping run to Walmart. \n\nThis location has a shared parking lot, but I've never had a problem finding a parking space. The inside is a good size with plenty of seating indoors as well as some outside. The place has always been kept clean and organized every time I've been to it. \n\nThe menu is just like all other Jamba Juice locations. They offer a wide variety of smoothies, energy bowls, shots, freshly squeezed juices, and tasty bites. I have however only ever tried their smoothies and are so in love with the taste and freshness of them! I have tried all of the smoothies that have Mango in them and love them all. I tend to stick to just the fruit and veggie smoothies as I've tasted some of the smoothies from their Creamy treats menu and they tasted more like a shake or ice cream than something that was healthy. May be good as a dessert drink instead of a breakfast smoothie. \n\nPrices are good for the quality of food\/drink you get. \n\nThe staff here have always been friendly and helpful when it came to suggestions. They always ask if you want to add any boosts to your smoothie, which is nice since I never remember about them until they ask. They are very efficient and get your orders out quickly. \n\nWould come back here again.
