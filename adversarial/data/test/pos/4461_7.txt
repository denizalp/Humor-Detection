The service here is horrible!!  They recently opened within the last couple months on the lot that used to be Arby's.  They have screwed up mine and two of my co-workers orders the last 3 times we have went.  That's batting 100!  The drive through is slower than molasses and takes a good 15 minutes, even when there is only one car in front of you.  I don't understand how it takes so long to not even make an order right.  I even sat and watched an employee check my bag like 5x so of course, I'd assume it was correct.   And fast food workers want $15\/hr?  Yea right!!
