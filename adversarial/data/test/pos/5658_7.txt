I had the worst dental experience here. My dentist was unsympathetic and flat out mean to me while I was having a breakdown right in the chair because of my fear of the dentist. He didn't offer any solutions but warned me that he'd have to send me to a different dentist if I didn't stop crying.  It was so embarrassing. The work that he did do was unsatisfactory and I still have pain because of it. Also I specifically asked the front staff for a quote before hand because I was worried about how much it would cost. They gave me a quote and said that it wouldn't change but sure enough as soon as I got done it was quite a bit more than they had originally told me :-(
