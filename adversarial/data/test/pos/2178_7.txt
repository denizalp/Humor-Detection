I wasn't expecting much. The theater is very small and on the second floor of the V Theater. The theater itself is very narrow and long. We were sat in seating group C which was perfect. Not too far away, and not close enough for the MC to pick on you. (Take note however, that you can only enter your row of seats from the one side, so if you need to pee or you want to leave, you can't leave from both sides.)\n\nSpeaking of the MC, I think he was the best part of the show. He was like a cross between Nathan Lane and someone I know. His singing voice is great, although I couldn't really understand the lyrics while he was singing, missing a lot of jokes. The fire alarm went off during the show on a part that I was enjoying, which one of the zombie girls fights an undead hand, which is actually her hand. I always find people acting like a part of their body is trying to fight them is hilarious and really hard to pull off (like Jim Carey in Me, Myself and Irene, and Bruce Campbell in Army of Darkness). So the alarm went off and the MC stopped the show. The zombie girl was sitting on the edge of the stage still in character trying to stop the hand from running off.\n\n\"Apparently the mall is on fire.\" We just sat there. To kill time the MC talked to the crowd and he was very quick witted and sharp. Actually I think that part was the funniest of the whole show. The show itself is very campy and cheesy. There were a few eye roll moments and def some WTF moments. A box of Jello dancing around with a bottle of vodka for instance.\n\nIf you've seen the Variety show downstairs, you know the contortionist in that show. He makes another appearance in this show but with zombie makeup. He is awesome and a must see no matter what show you see him in.\n\nAs for the girls, they were ok looking. The main girl that sings is beautiful but some of the others not so much. And you don't see much, pasties stay on. I would have liked more zombie makeup on the girls. Seems like the guys had better zombie makeup on. The MC makes a huge amount of costume changes too!\n\nLove any show that has a live band and not canned music. Props to the Asian girl trombone player. You don't see many girls playing brass.
