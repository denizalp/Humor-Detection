BEST TUNA MELT EVER.  I ATE THIS ALL DAY ERRYDAY FOR THREE F****** DAYS STRAIGHT! Story below.\n\nI went to Earls and bought two Tuna melts. Ate one on the spot and took the other back to the room. Woke up the next morning, threw half of it in the Foreman grill (cause someone had the brilliant idea to bring one to the hotel room), heated it up, ate it for breakfast. Then I went out during the day and came back. Guess what?  Waiting for me was the rest of the Tuna melt! Winner winner chicken dinner!!!! Felt like I just hit the jackpot on the penny slots!\n\nLater that night, went back to Earl's and bought two more tuna melts. Can you guess what happened?
