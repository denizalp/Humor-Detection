Stop what you're doing! Get on LYNX, a bus,  a taxi, in your car, walk, on horseback, a skateboard, a hang glider or a pogo stick and go to Futo Buta now!!!\n\nIncredible addition to South End!\n\nPork and scallop Gyoza are fantastic!\n\nThe Steamed Bun with Pork Belly is the best I've had!\n\nMiso (Hungry) is just bursting with sweet and savory flavors!\n\nEverything is made in house: the Gyoza wrappers and filling, chili sauce, the pork\/chicken broth for the miso and even the noodles. The noodles in my Miso were made two hours before I got there! You can't get any fresher!\n\nEven better, Lenny Boy is making them their own Kambucha!!\n\nSo like I said, drop your pencil, save your file, feed the dog and go there now!!! These guys are awesome!!
