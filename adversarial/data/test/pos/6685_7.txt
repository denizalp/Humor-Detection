This is probably one of the most best places I've dined at in a while. Their paella is incredible, so much seafood and chicken that two people might not be enough to finish it!! The red wine sangria was amazing, not too strong nor too weak, just right. Plus each meal is started off with warm fresh bread and olive oil, delicious!! And there are so many tapas to choose from, I recommend the plata combinado for a good all-around sampling of the tapas frias. The portions are great too, not to small that you're still hungry but not too large where you're walking out with a huge box.\n\nTapas Rias is fantastic, bottom line!!
