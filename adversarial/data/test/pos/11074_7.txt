Over inflated prices, exaggerated brands, ego driven shoppers, and ridiculous out of this world food that you can make at home? The hell do I want to go here for? Really not worth shopping here; really. Went in and could not believe how this place creates suckers out of people. Think your buying organic and helping some company with charity work? Hell no! Just the opposite. Your helping the business men get fatter wallets and helping yourself get more sicker with these fake healthy food. \n\n  Do some research and find out the truth about this place.  The employees are nice though, the shoppers blow. Typical shopper here are those parents with no mentoring skills to teach there kids properly. Instead of teaching them they hand them an ipad, or iphone in hopes of shutting them up and skipping on raising children. Single people here are just as dumb. If Whole Foods would just come out and say, \"Our shit isn't all that healthy and we have been lying.\" I'd shop here. But kinda a waste if you ask me. Bleh!
