This place has a lot of upside and a lot of reasons to not like it.  It's set up like an antique store for toys so the vendors have their items on display with prices (sometimes).  There are some real treasures here if you know what you are looking for.  Anime, Star Wars, McFarlane, WWE, it's all here.  You can get some great deals but not always.   It's a scalpers paradise too.  And I'm not talking about a measly 10-20% profit either.  I'm talking about toys that are on Amazon for $20 and still available in Walmart and Target for the same price being priced at $50 or more here. The wrestling figure booth prices are absolutely insane.  $75 for a figure still in stores?  Ok then.  Also, not everything is priced and the guy running the register when I was there had no clue what the price was.   I don't fault him for that though.   I found some Star Wars figures I wanted to buy with no price on them, none, anywhere.  Does someone need to explain to the vendors how a business works?
