Super new location. Therefore, it is big, nice, and clean. We went late on a Wednesday and the store was practically empty. There were barely any customers to be seen. I imagine this is typically the case during weekday nights. The staff was friendly. This location has loads of ribbons and ribbons. So if you need ribbons of all kinds, small, large, pre-made, in all shades and colors, this is the spot for you. They also have tons of frames and flowers. Loads of canvas as well but I couldn't find any circular ones, which is what I was searching for at the time. It was a little difficult to find what I needed. I feel like the location was better before it moved but the parking is million times better so that's a huge plus. The new store appears to be set up great for crafting events with multiple meeting rooms in the front of the store! I look forward to them offering a bunch of different options to explore!
