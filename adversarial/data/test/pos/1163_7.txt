I can finally check this off my New Years resolution list!! \nI have wanted to eat here a long time and convinced my brother to eat here instead of sushi next door @ Kabuki.\nWe walked into the restaurant with no wait seated immediately. Waited 10 minutes for a server to just acknowledge our presence so I had to flag one down and ask politely for drinks and our grill to be turned on (I had read previous reviews about turning grills on ASAP.)\nWe quickly placed our drink order and meat order since we had 10 minutes to browse the menu. \nMeats came out first and drinks after another 10 minutes. \nThe restaurant is CRAZY STAFFED, there is always a lot of servers walking back and forth so waving someone down wasn't impolite or rude in my opinion.\n\nThe food is obviously delicious and you can order up to 4 meats at a time and they use an iPad to its very prompt.\nWe ordered shrimp, premium steak, KFC, skirt steak and Forgot to order Korean ribs :( I had to try The yogurt Capri sun because the light up ice cube caught my eye though I'm not sure what the alcohol content is because you can't taste it. \nWill I return? Probably \nWill I be in a rush to return? No.
