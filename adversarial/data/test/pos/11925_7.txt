The Princess course might be the toughest in the valley. Hole number 13 caused nightmares for my father, who lost by 10 strokes despite the fact that he actually golfs and I don't. The course was empty on a recent Thursday morning and nearly all the holes were very challenging. Once again, watch out for #13 because your ball gets literally carried away in the water never to be seen again. It was $8 each, but my BOGO made it more affordable.
