We were in search for good Mediterranean food when we stumbled upon this sweat lodge that happened to serve falafel. Upon entering this fine establishment, we immediately enjoyed the near complete lack of light, as one would come to expect of any quality heroin den. It was pretty hot inside and there was no air conditioning, but the one ceiling fan was doing a good job of circulating the smell of smoke, depression and sweat evenly. The food: falafel and fries were pretty bland, but washing it down with my tap water made it even better. \n\nI question the sanity of people who say they come here to unwind and relax.
