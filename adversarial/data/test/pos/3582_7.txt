yo, I's serious.   Dis is me Good Luck club or something, cause when as soon as I walk in, I's got all these hoey looking girls all up on me.   I figure they like my bling, thats why.   or maybe because I's handsome.\n\nI gots me dog bone growing like mad inches up in this club.\n    i just wave me hand and be like,  \"Yo, you want some of this big dong or what?\"     and the girls just come on over.    \n\nI just have good luck in this club.
