So. Very. Cute. This place is made for dreamy coffee dates. Cocktails work, too.\n\nAt the entrance, a cute, small patio with pink chairs and tables are set to a backdrop wall of green foliage. On the inside, high ceilings and floral accents decorate the entire space. My favorite is a neon sign that reads, \"Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.\" I am huge on ambiance, and this place has it. \n\nIt was BUSY when I came. It seemed like a larger party was there, so \"BUSY\" might not be the typical vibe of the place. Due to the line and wait for food, I ordered a great almond-milk latte and cake donut. Both super yummy. \n\nI also saw they had some seemingly yummy salads, but I will have to come back when it's a tad bit slower next time.
