We arrived at about 10:10 am after reading reviews about this place. We were greeted by the owner's father who was attending the parking lot. He offered and grabbed us mini water bottles because it was already getting warm while we waited. We even had a little chat with him regarding his recommendations. Customer service was already impressive. \n\nJust so you know, if you don't get here early, you will be waiting in your car on the street just to get a spot inside. You've been warned. This place is literally in the middle of nowhere in some industrial area, but you won't regret coming here. Luckily while we were waiting, we were under an awning so the wait wasn't too dreadful in the Arizona heat. They opened up on the dot at 11 am and we were in. We ordered the fatty brisket(highly recommended), beef ribs, pulled pork, pork spare ribs, and sausage. Everything was pretty darn good, but the fatty brisket was theeee best. I think next time we go, we're definitely getting a LOT more of the fatty brisket. The sides were decent, and I actually enjoyed their grits. It tasted a lot like mashed potatoes.  \n\nI also highly recommend the smoked pecan pie for dessert. It was superb. You won't regret it. The staff is family owned and run so they're super friendly and will come and talk to you at your table while you eat to ask how everything is or if you need anything. You almost feel like you're at a family gathering. \n\nThe seating is limited inside, but this is one of those order, eat, and leave kind of spots, so by the time you are up to the counter and order your food, there is a chance for an open table. So if you go, don't sit around after eating and have a long deep conversation with friends. There are people outside waiting in 100 degree weather wanting to eat in a nice air conditioned room, sit, and enjoy their food too. Don't be that group.\n\nOverall, this place has great customer service, the staff is friendly and warm, and the food is amazing. Give this establishment a try, you won't regret it. Just get there early.
