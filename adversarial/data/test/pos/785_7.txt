Great ramen spot in China town. A bit hard to locate since it's tucked away in a small plaza. Parking lot is also smaller so if you go when it's busy beware parking maybe difficult. \n\nService was quick, very fast. Ramen broth is pretty flavorful and noodles are soft. Ramen seems to be the same at every place we go to, the broth and thrbsevice pretty much determine if it stands out. I would go back but unfortunately it didnt really stand out from any other of the 50 ramen houses in LV.
