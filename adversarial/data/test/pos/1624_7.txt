We signed up for the two hour and half hour tour but got stranded like Gilligan on a three hour tour without transportation that was suppose to be included in our tour. \n\nThe woman at the desk assured us that transportation was included and the shuttle would bring us back to the strip. She said it would leave at 12:50 pm.  After the tour which didn't get us back until 1PM we were on our own since the shuttle either didn't exist or had already left. They said if Bob was still on property he could take us but Bob never answered the walkie talkie call. My husband said to the guide \" I guess I am screwed and on my own and she just walked away and didn't say anything.\n\nWe actually enjoyed most of the tour. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable, it seemed she knew almost everything about Wayne Newton and his family. The tour was interesting and I had no idea that Wayne Newton did so many great things for the military and for so many people. He also had so much stuff. He knew Presidents and all kinds of celebrities and they all gave him give stuff. I saw more stuff than I have ever seen in my life.\n\nDon't get excited to see his zoo like I was.......There's only one pet monkey that has his own pet dog. A few of those little kangaroo type guys ( Wallaby's), a bunch of peacocks and a few parrots.....and over 40 Arabian Horses. \n\nI WARN YOU that some of the buildings that you tour have some sort of room refreshers in them that made us choke and also made our eyes  burn. These buildings were like smelly little old ladies houses when they use air refreshers to cover up dog or cat pee smell. \n\nI liked the tour except for the buildings with the smelly stuff that made me choke and my eyes to burn.\n\nIt wasn't fun to be left stranded there about 7 miles from the Strip. Maybe our tour guide was slow or they just underestimate the time it takes But beware that the 2-2.5 hour takes 3 hours\n\nYou can be left stranded without your included transportation too.
