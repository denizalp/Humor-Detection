Flying Biscuit is still excellent for breakfast. I had the Turkey Hash, which was a pile of fried potatoes, a big portion of what was probably turkey pot roast, two eggs over medium and cheese on top. With a big biscuit. This was a very large portion and it tasted great. I was very pleased with it.\n\nBeen here a few times and enjoy going back. It is VERY busy on the weekends, not as much during the week at breakfast time.
