Okay, first off, no hatin'. This place is a legitimate museum. It just happens to be owned by the guy who owns Deja Vu, next to a Deja Vu strip club and in the \"red light district\" part of town. If you can get past that, and are not offended by sex (gay, straight or otherwise), and are open minded, you can really get a lot out of the museum. The price of admission for locals is $10 and you really can get your moneys worth if you spend the time in the museum. \nOnce you find your way in (its on the side of the museum that doesn't say \"entrance\") you will be greeted by very friendly staff who will help you navigate the museum. The museum itself has tons of erotic visual art, vintage movies (as far back as the early 1900's, memorabilia, historic \"artifacts\", literature and contemporary pornography. It is definitely not a place for the squeamish, but it is not overly graphic as it could be. \nMy favorite part of the entire exhibit was the stuff on the First Amendment to the US Constitution. I don't think we really understand this Amendment well enough, and the museum really makes a point to promote the freedom of speech. I am no Constitutional scholar but they make a pretty good argument. \nOverall, there was only one exhibit that left me feeling a bit unnerved, but I think that is the point. \n\nThis is a great place to go if you want to learn more about a vital piece of American and Las Vegas culture. It really is a great place to learn, and it is very very unique. Definitely highly recommended if you are not offended by real human sexuality.
