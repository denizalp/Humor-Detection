This hockey arena is any NHL fan's wet dream come true. It's comfortable, spacious and has the highest seating capacity in the league, along with the most prodigious franchise in the sport making for a very unique and incredible experience. \n\nI've been there to see my beloved Boston Bruins play the Canadiens and although the tickets were very expensive ($150 per ticket), all five of us had an absolute blast there. The beers were tall boys, making for a drunkenly, wonderful time and the fans love their local team and it shows, but all in good fun. Honestly, the people were way nicer to us than we are to them when they come down.\n\nEach game starts with a video introduction that takes up the entire ice and lasts about 20 minutes as they introduce every single player who has ever played for the franchise, while spotlighting a certain few with video highlights of some of their best plays. \n\nI think that the only downsides to this arena are the fact that the tickets are exorbitantly expensive and due to some poor engineering, some seats in the upper deck have obstructed views due to the press boxes hanging in the way, preventing some fans from seeing any of the scoreboard and\/or part of the ice.\n\nBut despite these few negatives, this place blows away the TD Bank Garden and most if not all of the other arenas (expect maybe for Pittsburgh newest one which just opened this year).\n\nI cannot wait to return this upcoming January for another game.
