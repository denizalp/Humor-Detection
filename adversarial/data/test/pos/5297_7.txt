We need this kind of place on the peninsula.  It is big, friendly, tasty,  and cheap.  Picture a deli that rivals the size of a local Safeway, staffed with patient people who are willing to help you navigate a gigantic menu of sandwiches, soups and salads.  \n\nI had two different sadwiches on two different occasions.  The italian po boy was excellent.  It was too big, but otherwise perfect.  Later I had the meatball, which is good, but I the italian is better.\n\nOn top of the good sandwiches, they barrage you with free corn muffins, garlic toast, and ice cream.  People pile it sky high on plates - a great way to ensure they get full in case the 1,200 calorie sandwich does not do the trick.\n\nYum.
