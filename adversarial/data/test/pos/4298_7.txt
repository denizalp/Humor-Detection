Brutal Vegas weather on 9\/3\/10 at around 2:00 p.m. My boyfriend and I are INSANE fans of the show. So much so that we stood in line in the freaking heat outside the shop to get in. There was a small line formed when we arrived. We were told they were filming inside and that it would be about 30 minutes. It was more like 45 minutes. A lot of us stood out there and only muttered a few words.\n\n\"It's so hot.\"\n\n\"How long has it been?\"\n\n\"I hope Chum-Lee is inside.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to take a shower\". \n\nI now know what it feels like to be produce in a grocery store. They have this cool mist that constantly blows at the side of the entrance where everybody was waiting. I want to say THANK YOU for that nice touch it shows that they give a shit about us people who give a big enough crap to stand outside and wait.\n\nWas the wait worth it?\n\nWell let's see here. We walk in and immediately get hollered at. \n\n\"NO PICTURES. Absolutely no pictures. They only pictures right now are mental. We are still filming and don't even think about interrupting the shot!\"\n\nThis makes everyone walk extra cautiously and slow. I see some peple putting their cameras back in their pockets. We go on ahead and explore the shop.\n\nI instantly see the Jim Morrison painting and Rick is standing not too far away from it. The camera is on him, so I move it right along. We run into shelves and shelves of show merchandise. Coffee mugs, t-shirts, shot glasses, refridgerator magnets (some of which were autographed) hell, these guys even have their own bobbleheads.\n\nI take it all in, afterall all pictures at this point are still all mental.\n\nWe move it along and run into the awesome bright red coca cola machine.\n\n\"Remember this episode?\"\n\n They have A LOT of people working there. A lot of young people stocking the merchandise and checking out the customers who are buying  said merchandise.\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen you can NOW take pictures.\"\n\nOut come the cameras and on begins the posing. It got so crowded in the small shop that you felt at times like you were bumping into people. Everyone seemed to be looking for \"the guys\" and they kept being told that they were here but we couldn't see them. At one point the \"old man\" walked out and even though I got excited to see him I got hella nervous. \n\n\nWe were in there long enough to get a good look at everything and take pictures of the cool things in the shop. It's a lot of fun if you're a fan of the show. We didn't stick around long enough to see if we could get pictures with or of the cast but it's an overall worthy experience.\n\nUltimately, it was worth the wait!
