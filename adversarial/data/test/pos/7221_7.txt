Yay to homeownership! After 2 years of being in Charlotte, my husband and I finally made the plunge...and we signed on the dotted line, after line, after line... \n\nCarla Weyrick is a great realtor. She was highly recommended to us when we first moved to the Queen City. She was patient and every once and a while would check in on us, but never felt pushy like we should purchase. Once we were ready to buy we contacted her and she dedicated her time to help us find our new home...within 4 days, we placed a bid and the rest was history.\n\nIf you are thinking about buying or selling and need a realtor, give Carla a call. She has been in Charlotte for years and years and knows a lot about the area and trends. In addition, she has great connections with other businesses that you will need when purchasing (e.g., loan, attorney, appraisers, inspectors).
