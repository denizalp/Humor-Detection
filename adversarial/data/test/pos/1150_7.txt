Palace Station is like the worse version of Imperial Palace and I mean this seriously. The rooms are even cheaper than Imperial Palace and let me tell you ... it's for a reason. \n\nRules of Palace Station:\n1) don't take off your shoes\n2) wear sandals in the shower\n3) don't lean against the walls\n4) wear lots of clothes to bed and don't cover your face with the blanket\n\nI ended up with a nice chin rash from my blanket. blech, I wonder how.\n\nThe rooms aren't nice, the casino is dirty, I don't particularly enjoy it here and it's literally if you have absolutely nowhere else to go and don't want to spend any amount of money that you should even consider this place. But you should probably check Imperial first.
