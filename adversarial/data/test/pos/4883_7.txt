Hipster breakfast. The line was long but moved efficiently. \nWaiting 20+ minutes for a breakfast sandwich seems a tad excessive if I'm not on vacation. \nThe \"slut\" is basically a medium cooked egg over mashed potatoes. Salty and tasty. \nSausage egg and cheese biscuit on brioche bun is a fancy McMuffin. \nAfter tax and tip $27 for breakfast. \nEasy seating across from the restaurant. \nCoffee is better at Starbucks nearby.
