Holy guacamole! This is the Taco Bell of Taco Bells!! This is literally the perfect place to stop after a night out on the Las Vegas Strip. You know, when you're sad because you lost all your money gambling or because you bought 50 drinks for 50 people you thought were into you and they all turned you down, or because you danced in a pool of your own tears that everyone else thought was just sweat, or because you're a normal person who loves a fucktastic greasy cheesy Mexi-American tortilla creation. \n\nGo here. Buy yourself an alcoholic beverage, a Beefy 5 Layer, and sit in awe of the grandeur that is Taco Bell Cantina. I promise, you'll thank the universe. And if you don't, you did it wrong and you should try again.
