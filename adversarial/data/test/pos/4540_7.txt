My sister got us (2 guys, 2 ladies) on a guest-list, thanks to one of the many promoters found within Vegas. Unfortunately, us two guys couldn't make it as far as to the bouncer was that separated the outdoors from the indoors.\n\nYes, in the middle of winter, they somehow think it's alright for their customers to hang out outdoors (freezing). They don't tell this to you until you look like an idiot and try to enter, only to be denied. Have fun waiting outside and watching the pervert bouncers let certain ladies in, those who are exposing their cleavage and flirting with the bouncers. I tried getting a recording of this, but it was obvious what the bouncers were doing.\n\nTIP: GUYS... do not come to XS Nightclub (at least during the winter) if you are on the guestlist. Waste of time.
