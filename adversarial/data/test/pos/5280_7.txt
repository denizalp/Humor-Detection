While I'm not sure that \"Yay! I'm a fan\" encapsulates my feelings about Schwartz's, that's where we'll leave it.  \"Famous\" places like this are usually vastly disappointing.  But a sandwich of pretty high quality can be had for $5.50 CDN.  The pickles are pretty decent.  The fries aren't great.  And you'll probably be treated to a progression of baffling American tourists.  \n\nOn my visit, I sat next to a well-proportioned girl who was dining with a an ultra-heavy man for whom sandwich cramming apeared an exertive, aerobic activity.  Not satisifed with the (generous) dimensions of his sandwich, he also found time to consume half a loaf of rye bread, three 1\/2 sour pickles, his lady friend's french fries and two 7 Ups.  While his friend\/lover paid, he fanned himself for several seconds before working up the wherewithal to descend from his stool.
