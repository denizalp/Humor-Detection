Beer was spilled all over me, my phone, the table. The incompetent waitress starts laughing. Really? The place was a ghost town so no issue with trying to manage multiple tables. Asked the owner, apparently a former hockey player, who would be replacing my phone if the beer damaged it. He says, arrogantly... be nice, accidents happen. \n\nHe should stick to hockey. Uncool!
