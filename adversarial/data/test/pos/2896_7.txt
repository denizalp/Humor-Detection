Milano's...MOVE OVER! Da Marco is THE go-to place if you want a real delicious Italian panini. I ordered the Marco's special and my sister ordered Pino's Prosciutto and both were amazing! \n\nThe staff was friendly and courteous. They made me feel welcome the moment I walked through the door. The service was quick and efficient. If you're looking for a fast grab n' go option this place will meet your needs. Hit this place up if you're in the east end. I certainly can't wait to return.
