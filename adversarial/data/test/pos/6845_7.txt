Dr. B is the best. I am Pretty sure the B doesn't stand for Best or Bomb, but it most definitely should. I like my teeth a lot. I take really good care of them. Never had a cavity. Never needed any major dental procedures. Candace took me back to have a look at my grill. Did some x-rays and got right down to cleaning them bad boys. Once finished Dr. B came over and complemented my smile, he told me that he wanted to keep an eye on some staining on the surface of a few of my molars. Gave me some tips on how to prevent them from becoming full on cavities. Yes, sir. \n\nThis was the boy's first cleaning at 9 years old. But he also takes really great care of his mouth. Brushes twice a day for at least 2 minutes. He has the cutest smile so I want to make sure he has it for the long haul. He was completely fascinated with the entire procedure. He was asking a lot of questions about his teeth and the x-rays and what would be happening next. His first visit was a complete success. No cavities! Dr. B and Candace both really liked the boy and even another hygienist came over to tell me how sweet and inquisitive my child was! Could seriously bring a mama to tears! The fact that they were super cordial to the child and his questions means the world. I love people who don't treat a child's curiosity as a bother. Anywho, Dr. B suggested that we get the child's molars sealed to prevent cavities. Whatever you say doc. Done and done!\n\nSandy at the front desk made us an appointment for the following week. Completely painless! And the sealants went on a week later without a hitch. Even got our next 6 month cleanings scheduled.
