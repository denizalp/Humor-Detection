Very cool there is now a Mediterranean\/Greek\/Middle Eastern joint in my area. Even cooler, they have delivery service 4 miles out! This place is in the strip mall where Naga and the yogurt place is. \n\nWhat I'm loving here are the non meat options that I had so far. \n\nSay yes to Eggplant Salad! Warm eggplant on bed of salad greens sprinkled with seasonings and almond slivers. The small size bowl was filled up plentiful of eggplant and perfect serving size for lunch.\n\nMy other favorite; the Vegetarian Combo Platter. It had many of my Greek and Middle East favorites,Baba Ganoush,Hummus,Grape Leaves, Falafel, and seasoned flat bread.  I enjoyed this dish! Although the hummus doesn't measure up to Bon Chef Cafe's version (I so miss Chef Ash!)\n\nThe Zatar seasoning that chef makes and uses in a lot of the dishes here is awesome!!! It was meticulously sprinkled on each slice of my flatbread. I had to comment and ask what's the deal with the spice blend he used because it's different from the Greek and Middle Eastern places I've been to. I learned from Chef Manny that his spice blend included thyme,sesame seeds, and ..I forget..but whatever it is, I was diggin it! Also he said he uses mint leaves and mentioned that he used it in the Eggplant Salad that I had couple weeks ago..(whoa dude remembered me??... xtra cool point!!!). I have to note from talking with him, he really takes pride in what he makes. I so appreciate that it's all made from scratch. \n\nThe Shrimp Kebab was also delish. A little confused though as to why it wasnt on a skewer. No biggie. It's nice that you can order it ala carte. And you can order the Beef, Chicken and Lamb kebabs too ala carte. \n\nThe only thing I wasnt too crazy about is the Tzatziki sauce...I want to say it's sour cream based. Kinda bland and consistency was just too thick and rich for my taste. It's all good though because the spices used in the gyro meat made up for it. But still a tad disappointing. But with the many menu choices that there are I can live without it. \n\nThey did a great job renovating the dining area. Smart use of space seating wise. Seems like a few more tables added than the previous tenants. (Fix8, Cino's, Lucca Deli)  Big plus to the TV  playing sports channel. I caught part of the baseball playoffs when I had a dinner break here.(Yay Giants!) \n\nPrice for lunch I found reasonable. It's fast\/casual dining. Order at counter and they'll bring your food out to you. Service was good.  I found the staff pretty friendly and was impressed that Chef remembers his customers. The times I was there, there were quite a few regulars already coming and going to this fairly new place. Easy going dining experience. Ive got no major issues. For sure in my lunch\/dinner rotation. Imma Fan!!! Four Stars!
