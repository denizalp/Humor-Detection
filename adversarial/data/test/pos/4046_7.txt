Weird.  I swear I have reviewed WinCo Foods already.  Here are the pros and cons. \n\nPros: \n-Located close to home\n-Open 24 hours\n-Best prices in town compared to other grocery stores. \n-Best prices on eggs, egg whites, Greek yogurt, 93% ground beef, and 90% turkey.\n-Great prices on natural peanut butter. They have Justin's\n-Lovely staff\n\nCons:\n-Cash or Debit Card Only (all good, I rarely use my credit card)\n-Great deals are usually wiped out by Sunday night\n-Long lines on Sunday's \n-No Wi-Fi\n-I have to bag my own groceries\n\nTIP: Get your pumpkins for Halloween here.  Cheapest in town!!!\n\n2017 Yelp Review #50
