I usually fly Southwest and United but saw the extremely cheap fair and decided to go with American Airlines. Huge mistake!\n\nI fly all of the time to San Francisco. I go there 3-5 times a year not to mention on states and countries I visit. I always arrive 1 HR to departure and I never have an issue. Sky harbor is pretty awesome and it generally takes me 20 mins from the time I drop my bag to hitting the gate.\n\nI show up and I'm standing outside with a long line behind me. 1 couple holds us all up with their overweight bags. Even with all the customers complaining the lines not moving, the guy (nice as he was) never had that couple or any of us go inside to check in at one of those desks. By the time I get to the counter the guy weighs my bag, prints stickers, does some other stuff, checks me in, hands me my ticket, and then swipes my card to pay for the bag. But what do you know, he says he's sorry but I'm 3 mins late and the computer won't let him check my bag. I can get on the flight but my bag can't.\n\nHe sends me inside where I dash in to see NO LINE! Why the hell didn't he send us all in sooner!!! But I'm calm, I run up to a rep and tell her my situation and I have a connecting flight. She's kind and points me to a rep who can help. I run to the desk and the woman doesn't even let me finish explaining what happened and instead cuts into me in the most rude way. She tells me and I quote it, \"I'm not trying to be rude but this whole situation is your fault. You should have been here 3 hours early to make it through security.\" I look around and there is no one waiting. Every person I spoke to there was no wait. The woman continues to bash me on what an idiot I am and how I screwed up and everything is my fault and the only thing I want is answers if they can help. After she finishes her verbal whiplash on me with people watching she points me to a counter.\n\nI walk to the counter and again no line and I explain what happened. They tell me they can load my bags but they won't check me in because I'll never make it through security. Well that's my decision lady, if I want to risk it let me. She refuses to let me on and instead issues me a new ticket.\n\nI run through security in 20 mins flat from her desk to the gate where I watched everyone finish boarding. I'm livid at this point. I told them I had a connecting flight internationally I needed to catch and they made no effort to help me on the flight.\n\nThe first 2 reps outside and by the door were kind and helpful and they thought I could make it. But after getting into the building there was nothing but rude people. I paid for all kinds of extras like exit row and extra leg room which they didn't give me on my new flight. There was exit rows available and they gave them to different people at the gate.\n\nThanks to them I had to pay $950 to rebook my international flight and sleep in a flipping airport for 18 hours in San Francisco once I landed.\n\nAnd what really pissed me off was not just getting to the gate and watching from the window as they loaded bags and passengers for the flight they said I'd never catch. No, it was the fact I listened to them overhead call out other people's names and tell them that they'd hold the flight for them! Yes, no bullshit they actually asked people to please check in because they were holding up the flight just for them. But me and 3 mins and I was belittled and talked down to by multiple people and denied my flight. \n\nI will NEVER fly AA again. After my flight home I am done with these people! Not that they'll care. And even United was trying to help me fix what AA wasn't trying to help with.
