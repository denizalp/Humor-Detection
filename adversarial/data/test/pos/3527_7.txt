Okay meatballs.  My average lunch ticket here ($18) on several visits far exceed my usually allocation for daily work lunch ($10 average).  Foodwise, I have had:\n\nMeatball panini with dipping sauce - probably the better item versus the other below choices. Reason being is that the sandwich must be pressed in a panini press, forcing out a hot sandwich.  Still hungry after having this.  3.5 stars.\n\nMeatballs over pasta (Saucy Balls with pasta option).  Meatballs taste okay with the spicy meatballs having the most flavor.  Meatballs in all visits are never hot and lukewarm at best.  2.5 stars\n\nTater tots:  good.  Crunchy and crispy.  If I crave tator tots, I will come here.\n\nProbably will not return due to cold meatballs and high lunch prices for non-filling\/satisfying content.
