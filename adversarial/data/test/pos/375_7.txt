An up-converted campus hotel with a hyper-specific theme? Seems like one of those old tropes that's a recipe for mediocrity. But the folks behind The Graduate nailed it. It's not just the slick design elements, the cool branding, or the fact that it has a sunny pool. What really makes this hotel shine is the attention to detail. \n\nFirst off, my room was CLEAN. That's better than I can say for a lot of hotels I stay in, and I stay in a ton of decently expensive hotels. Really, I could end the review there. Clean rooms are hyper important. But on top of the cleanliness, the rooms were cozy, comfortable, well appointed, and had all the features a traveler would need. Free wifi, mini-fridge in the room, TV, desk, plenty of charging options, shower (bonus -with a door that closes - learn something, SF hotels!), and friendly front desk staff. The style of decor? Totally fun. And the carpet! That merits a nice review on its own. Great carpet designs all over the hotel. \n\nThe pool is small, but it does the trick. You can get drinks from the bar at the pool. And as a bonus, it's open 24 hours. \n\nOnly real downside is the lack of substantial fitness room, but I'm told they'll give you a pass to use the ASU facilities just down the street. Bonus! \n\nLoved my stay here. Would definitely return!
