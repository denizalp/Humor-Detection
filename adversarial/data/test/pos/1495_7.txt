This was my second time here and it completely redeemed themselves.\n\nThe wait was very minimal, we came on a Wednesday night. It just so happened when we got seated they did their usual happy hour chant, or so it seems. My Jameson was only $5 and Sapporo $4, not bad. \n\nFor those new to Gen, it is all you can eat (AYCE) and is $21 per person. It includes all the meats you expect and their sides too. The service was really good this night always checking up on us. As for quality, this was one of the best I've seen at a $20 AYCE place. Barely any fat at all on the brisket and they were not frozen either. \n\nThis is a great choice for dinner if you're looking for something off the strip :)
