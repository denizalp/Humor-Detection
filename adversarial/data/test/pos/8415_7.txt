Ok, so this will be a long one I'm sure, but here goes. I made an appointment for mani-pedis for my cousin and I, and a paraffin pedicure for my mom. We get there 10 minutes early, and sit down. 40 minutes later they call my mom back first (she has only ever had one pedi before, keep this in mind). They take her into another room and the girl says, \"Pick a color\" and then walks out (this is all what my mom told me, we were still in the waiting room). Then about 5 minutes later the girl comes back and says, \"Why aren't you in the seat. Sit in the seat\" and then walks out again. \n\nAt this point they call my cousin and I into the room, that has ONLY 2 seats... Why schedule 3 mani-pedis with only 2 seats??? So, my cousin sits down, we pick colors, and wait and wait and wait and wait. An hour into our appointment, someone finally says, \"They will be with you in a minute, we should have 6 people on, but the manager only scheduled 4.\" (A. this is none of my business B. this is your problem, not mine).\n\nAt this point someone ELSE comes in and offers to start my manicure, since I am sitting in the room doing nothing while my mom and cousin are at least soaking their feet. I get talked into the shellac manicure and am assured my sparkly black color will look the same in shellac. She starts the manicure, and proceeds to tell me how much she hates doing nails and complains about the other people in the salon the WHOLE TIME. Not only do I feel like slitting my wrists with the cuticle scissors, but I notice that the \"black\" she is using is more clear with silver glitter (gag) than anything else. She assures me that it will get darker with the second coat, and proceeds to tell me how hard shellac mani's are because you cant get any on the skin or it will peel. Layer 2, still glitter on clear, so she asks someone else what to do. They say here use this color it's close. HA, so she proceeds to paint my nails GOLD, really? that's not black. Then, I notice that my skin starts burning under the UV, and she informs me that, that doesn't happen. When I look, I can see that she got it all over my cuticles.\n\nAt this point my cousin comes in, tells me that they didn't even touch her heals during the pedicure and my mom's nails are still wet (her $50 pedicure only lasted 15 minutes and had been over for 45 at this point). So, I'm like, forget this lets just go. Mind you, I had not even had the pedi part of my mani-pedi. So, My cousin and I had groupons and my mom had spafinder gift certificates.  I ask if I can have the shellac comped instead of a pedicure and get told yes by 2 people (I'm the one taking the hit on this deal now). When we go to checkout the \"manager\" comes over and starts fighting with me wanting money. I tell her we have groupons and gift certificates and she says that the groupon is for a mani-pedi and I didn't finish, so I can't use it. So, I remind her that I have another appointment in 30 minutes and we had been there for 2 hours. She says that it's not her fault and they explained that people came in late. (personally, I don't care, they should have sent the person that was late home and taken the people that were on time at the right time) At this point I just say, \"no\" and turn to leave. She grabs my mom's arm and says \"You can't leave until we call spafinder.\" Personally, I would have smacked her for grabbing my arm and told her to effe off, but my mom is made of better stuff than I am. We proceed to wait 7 minutes (I counted, we were now late for our appointment) while she called and validated the gift cards and the other stylist yelled over the salon, \"What? Don't they work? That figures.\" We said nothing, waited, and she told us it went through. \n\nFast forward to now, I have gold nails (not black) that I am stuck with for 2 weeks, 2 have pealed off (its been 24 hours), and no pedicure; my cousins nails were so poorly done that she removed the polish as soon as she got home; and my mom ruined a pair of socks and a pedicure because the polish NEVER dried. \n\nGo to this place if you want something to do as an alternate to stabbing yourself in the eye... Better yet, This is a great place to buy gift certificates for your mother-in-law.
