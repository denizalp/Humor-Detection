Warning! Hipster Alert! \n\nWait ... hipsters in Downtown Las Vegas? Yes. If you haven't been to Downtown Vegas in a while, there is a slow but steady transformation and revitalization of the areas surrounding the Fremont St. Experience. And perhaps the most grand of these efforts is the Downtown Container Park, a slice of hipster paradise amidst one of the oldest parts of Las Vegas. \n\nDTCP is a pretty neat place. The concept is that they have taken old cargo containers used for rail transportation and turned them into a hipster strip mall. There's also different pieces of art made out of junk to fit the theme, and at the center a massive playground where the hipsters can dump their kids while they get a glass of wine or microbrew. \n\nAnd of course the shops themselves are uber-hipster as well. There's several art galleries (including one that is focused on Disney Fine Art, so hipster cute!), specialty food shops (cupcakes, jerky, kettle corn, oh my!) and apparel shops. There's a nice selection of restaurants and bars here as well, including some great BBQ, a Kerry Simon backed venture that specializes in pork and beans, a vegan\/raw food eatery, a wine bar, and a specialty cocktails\/craft beer bar. \n\nDTCP does look a little bit out of place in the midst of the old \"low roller\" casinos in this part of Vegas. If anything, it looks like a destination pulled right out of a Portlandia sketch. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Variety is good, and the locals I spoke with seemed to like it as a spot that was different - something that you wouldn't normally find in Vegas. If you need a break from the Glitter Gulch, a short walk down to DTCP will provide a nice respite that will appeal to your inner (or outer) hipster.
