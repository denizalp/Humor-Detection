First time in a gay night club in Las Vegas.\nCame with my gay friend. Got hit on by gay servers but they might be just working on their tips. LOL\n\nThe place was a BLAST!!!\n\n.: More gay guys than lesbians.\n\n.: They have private rooms upstairs! woot woot.. anything goes baby!\n\n.: And they have cute dancers :)\n\n.: They have a food truck in the back too and some outdoor seating.\n\n.: SO MUUUUUCH FUN!!
