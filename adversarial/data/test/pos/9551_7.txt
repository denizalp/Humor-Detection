After reading all the reviews, I took my Cajun mother here for her birthday. We had a great experience. No fights, no drunks, our orders came out in a timely fashion and perfect. Everything that we tried was excellent. The place was clean and had a relaxed atmosphere. Ginger beer cocktails too!\nWe routinely track down the new Cajun restaurants in town and we are impressed. I'll be back and will be bringing friends and family. \nPlace is hidden so you do have to hunt for it. If i can get them to add Bayou brand rum to the bar I would be happier than a crawfish in a rice field.
