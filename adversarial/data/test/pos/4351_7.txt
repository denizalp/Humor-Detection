This is an updated review. I remember this place to be so good. So my family was in town and we decided to go there. What a mistake. First of all the place was dead and now I know why the quality of fish is not what it used to be. The rolls weren't as good as I remember it. The service was horrible and the waitress had an attitude so did the waiter. With so many other sushi places to choose from sorry to say I won't be back!
