The Double Down is perhaps the biggest F**K YOU to the Las Vegas Strip that I came across.  \nIt took about a day or two before I got tired of the whole Strip scene and I found myself asking cashiers, bartenders, waitresses, etc (the locals) of a good dirty dive bar within proximity that served cheap booze and loud music that sounded nothing like LMFOAF and NIcky MInaj. All signs pointed to the Double Down.\nThats what this bar is, the Anti-Strip. Its dirty, its sleazy, its loud and when the jukebox isnt blasting some punk song, a live band is taking care of making noise. \nDo not expect high heels, tribal tattoos, Ed Hardy, or the wealthy high-rolling Cristal sipping alter egos of people actually making 30K back home in the real world. Its fun to escape reality while in Vegas for a while, but this bar makes sure to put you right in check.
