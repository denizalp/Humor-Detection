This Hot Topic location can be found in the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip. It's actually located on the second floor, not too far from Nordstroms. I found it easiest to just park in the garage just off Spring Mountain Road,in front of Dillards, and just walk through Dillards to get there.\n\nAnyways, the only reason I go to Hot Topic is for my budding Funko Pop! addicition. Today I heard they had a hard to find, fast selling one still available here. This was my first visit to this location, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. \n\nThis is one of the best Hot Topic locations I have visited! This location is quite large and very, very clean! Nice! They have a good size wall in the back left corner where they keep the majority of their Pops! staged at and I was more than impressed with the massive and diverse selection they had available. \n\nAs with all Hot Topics, I received friendly and attentive customer service here as well! The lady working today helped me find what I was looking for and was quite pleasant while doing so.\n\nI bought what I was hoping to find in a quick, pleasant, and seamless transaction. Plus with the selection they have here, I am 100% certain to be returning in the near future!\n\n4 stars.
