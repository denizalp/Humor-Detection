So my sister had told me about this place and I was hesitant due to the fact that we in LA have sprinkle. Well sprinkle has nothing on this place. They have the best cupcakes and variety I have ever seen. Not only do the taste good but they look so cute. the store is also very cute and clean. The help is very nice, friendly, and knowledgeable. Price is worth the cupcake. $30 for a dozen and if your a local you buy 12 dozen and get a 13th free with a punch card. They have little mini samples to taste.\n\n I bought a dozen, I tasted the Southern Belle which is red with a cream cheese frosting. This is there BEST cupcake it is so great the cake melts in your mouth while the frosting has a great texture to it and amazing flavor. I also got the Boston Cream Cake, strawberry with champange frosting, Chocolate, and Banana. They were all equally good in there own way. Each with the cake melting and perfect texture and frosting with excellent flavors. If you are in Vegas it is a MUST EAT!
