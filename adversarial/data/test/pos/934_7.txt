Our relatives brought us to Allo Mon Coco for breakfast.  There are quite a few locations in Montreal.  I think this is the branch we visited.  \n\nThe breakfast did not disappoint.  Each of us was happy and stuffed!  Our crepes were extremely delicious!!  Sorry, but I do not remember the names of our crepes.  Have a feeling that they are all good.\n\nHighly recommend visiting one of their locations when in Montreal!!
