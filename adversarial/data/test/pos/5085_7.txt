This is the Starbucks located inside of Vdara Hotel and it's not a good one. \n\n\nWhen I arrived, the line was very short, only 3 people in front of me. The lady that was taking my order could not get my name right even though I spelled it 3 times for the 4 different drinks. This is not a big deal at all, but there was a misunderstand with someone before me so another worker told her to tell the customers something specific and she said \"i told them, i don't know if they don't speak english\" in a very rude manner, right in front of them too. \n\nI was waiting for my drinks and one of them was a mocha frap, but they call out white mocha frap. I tell them that I ordered a mocha and an other girl who is making the drinks asks me if my name is Jared. I say no, I'm Melody, but I ordered Jareds drink to bring it up for him. She dumps the drink back in the blender and adds 3 mocha pumps and blends it and she was about to pour it back into the same cup which was dripping so I ask her for a new cup and she rolls her eyes at me and gives me a new cup. \n\nWhen I get upstairs I realize that the drink now has 6 pumps of syrup, 3 white and 3 mocha and is unbearably sweet. They should have made one from scratch. \n\nThey were out of grande cups, out of whipped cream and all they had was too many mistakes and too much attitude.
