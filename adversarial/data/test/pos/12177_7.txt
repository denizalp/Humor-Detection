Me: \"Turn up the Gino Beats\"\nWaitress \"What?!\"\n\nExactly.... it's 6:00pm on a Sunday and this place is playing (horrible) music so loud that I can't hear my friends talking to me. I am all for loud music but this was not the type of establishment that should be cranking it up so early.\n\nOur waitress was USELESS! We ordered a beer, and cocktail and some pan cheesy bread... the bread showed up 15 mins after we ordered with no drinks in sight. Our waitress came by and looked stunned that we had no drinks. REALLY?! Did you think they were going to make themselves and walk over here?! \n\nThe service was painfully slow and I couldn't help but thinking that if the waitresses put half as much time doing their jobs as they did looking like club kids, things might look up for this location.\n\nAfter all its situated in a rather convenient are of town and has a killer patio. Alas it is not so and I spent all night shaking my head at the leather wearing, bra showing tart that was seating people as they came in... (see picture)\n\nDesperation has a new home it seems.
