I just drove home in a new Toyota Prius from Big Two Toyota.  I tried to buy a Ford Fusion from San Tan Ford in Chandler but the following factors led to my decision to break ranks and buy a \"foreign\" car:\n\n1. San Tan wanted $35,000 and change for their Ford Fusion (yes it had all the bells including leather. I just couldn't see paying $10,000.00 more for a Fusion than a Prius with virtually the same options.\n\n2. The sales manager \"Joe\" was pushy, manipulative, and used high pressure tactics in an attempt to close me on other cars and \/ or a much higher payment. I never could get a straight answer on how much the car cost and instead was hammered on the payment. The other thing that scared me was the fact that they wanted to give me only $2800.00 at the outset for my trade when I knew full well that it was worth at least $5,000.00 at the auction and was further verified by Kelly Blue Book. I later sold my trade to an individual for $5500.00 cash. \n\n3. I got repeated calls from these guys trying to get me back into the dealership and every time they kept bumping the trade value of my car up...if they wanted my business they should have given me the best deal up front rather than playing games with me.\n\n4. They made me feel like they were trying to \"play\" me.\n\n***Oh and Sam Cumbo mentioned in the other review STILL WORKS THERE! \n\nAnyway I just bought from Big Two Toyota (around the corner from them) and they gave me a great deal for less than Edmunds said I should have paid. I was treated like solid gold and got 48 months interest free! \n\nStay away from San Tan Ford.  If you want a sure enough deal go see Chris Davis at Big Two Toyota Scion in the internet fleet department. He's honest, professional, and sells cars the way they are supposed to be sold. Here is his phone number: (480)287-3191
