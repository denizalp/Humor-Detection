With the exception of two despicable toddlers whose parents needed a lesson in child discipline, Justin E. and I were younger than the average Old Yorke patron by 30-40 years. At 6pm this place was slammed with grandparents, in-laws, and other family members queuing up to get a seat.\n\nI heard not one but TWO separate diners utter the following sentence:\n\"I'm in a quest to find the city's best fish and chips and so far this is still my favourite.\" If that's not an endorsement I don't know what is. \n\nThis was the first time I was ever trying fish and chips so I had to go for the 'premium' type recommended to me - the halibut - with a side order of haddock just for comparative purposes.\n\nThe menu is heavy on the standard F&C options - cod (from Iceland), haddock (the usual) and halibut, all at around $11 with chips. There was also a \"Weight Watchers\" version of fish and chips made with broiled halibut and salad instead of fries. Then there were some more creative options like shrimp 'n chips, scallop 'n chips and even a hamburger and chicken breast. If you like beer they have Guinness, Tetleys Cream Ale and Steam Whistle on tap. A glass of wine was only $6.50 (!).\n\nHalibut and chips were quite tasty and the ratio of batter to actual fish was solid. Chips were well done and I never thought I'd say this but I've now sampled tartar sauce and I actually liked it. I can't say that fish and chips will be something I'll be eating regularly as I eat enough fried food as it is and if something's gonna be deep fried I need it to be a little saltier, but if I do I'll definitely be back here.\n\nAs if I had any room in my gullet for dessert, I still ordered from the list of homemade treats (deep fried pineapple rings, sherry trifle, apple crisp or pumpkin pie). Of course I had to go for the seasonal pumpkin pie and as expected it was CrazySexyCool.
