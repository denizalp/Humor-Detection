We had a family reunion here in late June. Casino is located in downtown Las Vegas - meaning less crowd and less foot and vehicle traffic. The rooms we stayed in are adequate (four rooms total with adjacent doors between two rooms that made the rooms feel more like a suite). Not the typical you-can-get-lost-here kind of a casino. The layout is smaller compared to the strip hotels with only 3 or 4 hotel towers within the compound. \n\nIf you are dipping in the pool, make sure you reserve a private cabana that easily fits a party of 15-20 people ($250 per day equipped with a ceiling fan, lounge chairs, fridge, champagne bucket, ice, flat screen TV, DVD, piped in muzak, and complementary fruit tray). It's well worth to have a place to relax and cool down in the blasting Nevada heat.\n\nThere's also a 200,000-gallon aquarium in the middle of the pool that houses more than a dozen 15-foot sharks and other sea creatures. It's really cool. Watch scuba divers clean the inside glass of this ginormous tank while they fend off the sharks from getting a chunk of human flesh.\n\nUnfortunately they had to close down the pool  for at least 5 hours because someone let out a #2 in the pool. Gross. Maybe it's one of those conspiracy tactics by the casino mafias for people to get back into the casino and gamble?? Hmmm tricky.
