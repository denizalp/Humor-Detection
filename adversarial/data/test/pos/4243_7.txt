This new diner, from the owners of the old Alvies, is in the old Sammy's Grill location in the PNC building. It has brought back everything that my friends and I missed about the old Alvies on Ontario: friendly and fast service, casual atmosphere, and delicious food. \n\nThis is the place to go if you are looking to eat your feelings.
