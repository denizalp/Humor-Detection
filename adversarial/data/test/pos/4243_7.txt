This little, cramped hole-in-the-wall place is chock full of the tackiest, most tasteless, light fixtures in the county! It seems that every time I stop in, there's something even more tacky--and since I absolutely LOVE tacky stuff, that's a very good thing.\n\nModern Lighting also has all sorts of tchotchkies, like Phoenix Country Club playing cards, thoroughly modern handbags, costume jewelry, mid-century furniture, and the most adorable little foo-foo dog in the world! The owner found this little guy abandoned in Yuma of all places, nursed him back to health and now parades all 1 pound or so of him on the front counter--so don't come in there expecting to rob the place, or you'll have this little foo-foo dog aiming for your wrist and eating his way up!\n\nThe vintage bubble light fixture we scored here looks really good in our 1953 retro-modern hybrid main bath, and the mineral oil lamp is just the ultimate in tastelessness! [I recall seeing them in every old trucker's house, now it's gonna be in my house!!!]\n\nSo if you need some real fixtures for  your retro mid-century fixer-upper, head over to the corner of Central and Camelback and prepare to dish it up...
