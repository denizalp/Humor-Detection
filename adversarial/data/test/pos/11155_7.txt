I have been coming here for quite a while. Its a neat hidden coffeeshop near Finch.\n\nAll foods and drinks are served in proper China plates \/ mugs which is always welcomed over paper cups. Instead of your generic chairs and tables you have some real comfy, living room style couches.\n\nBoth hot and cold drinks are great (except sik hye!). Sweets are tasty and come in generous portions. Most items has chocolate including bagels! It's reasonably priced.\n\nComplimentary lemon water. Washrooms are very clean. WiFi used to be bad but its much better now.\n\nI'm surely treated like a princess every time I come here!!
