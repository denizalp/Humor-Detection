Decided to give this place another shot today since I was in the area. I shouldn't have. I went through the drive thru and this time the food was even more unappetizing than the last. I ordered a steak quesadilla and a chicken taco. The steak was fatty and the taco had a weird smell like maybe the oil used to cook the tortilla had gone rancid.  Both wound up in the trash.
