I drove here 25 minutes from Cave Creek because of the reviews on Yelp. Like many, I LOVE simple street food, a nd love to root for the small guy who is disadvantaged. However, I will not gratuitously leave a 5 star review because it is fashionable, or because  \"....everyone is doing it!..\"  I didn't read ALL the reviews, so I didn't realize that the business existed under a tent in the parking lot of a tire store, with  ABSOLUTELY NO signage. Anyway, after following the G.P.S. and finding nothing that remotely resembled a taco stand, I called the number on Yelp!. The lady answered, and was linguistically challenged,but managed to say that  she was opening at 6:40, not 6 pm as it says online. \nShe could not verify the location, however, so she put what I assume was her son on the phone. After verifying the address, and that there was no signage, so I WAS in the right place! He then repeated that they would open at 6:40 pm. \nWhat an odd freaking time I thought....and went and had a pint of beer, as it was 6:05. These things happen, right?....the manana attitude.\n When I came back at  6:50, they had just pulled in the tire store parking lot, and had not even BEGUN preparing any food. When I asked how long for a hot dog, I was told, \"...about 25 or 30 minutes ...\" by the son. \nNow I WAS irritated. I drove nearly a half hour, waited another 50 minutes past their posted opening time, showed up when they told me to, and it was going to be another half hour. . When I said Yelp! said 6pm he replied...\"yeah, they need to change that.\" \nI told the Einstein that Yelp does not track and change his business hours on his whim, that was his job. \"Oh, I didn't know that.\" When I asked why he told me to come back at 6:40, he shrugged and said. \"Sorry..\" and walked away.
