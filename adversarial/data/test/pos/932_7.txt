I really like it. I like it very much. \n\nThis is the The Hotel version of Mandalay Bay. I will describe it as a Condotel rather than a suite. A suite, in my opinion, has a separate  bedroom. While The Signaturehas a kitchen (complete with pots and pans) and full size living room - it is an open concept. You can see your pillow as you microwave your hang over pizza from last night. \n\nWifi network is fast - good for business travelers. The resort charges something like $ 25 to access pool and internet. But resort fee is common in Las Vegas hotels. Unless you're in Rio I guess. \n\nConcierge is typically awesome even though excellence customer service in Las Vegas has generally declined over the years (they should stop hiring miserable staff). \n\nThere's a covered pathway to MGM casino and convention center from all Towers. So Ka Theatre and many restaurants inside are about 7 minutes away. Restaurants inside MGM are OK. Not great. Not bad. They're OK. I would go to Mandalay Bay or Caesar's Palace for nice dinners. \n\nEach tower has a heated pool and open seasonally. While those pools offer privacy, they don't give you a lot of opportunity for people watching. No flirting, sorry. \n\nIf you want to party, be rowdy and be seen - go to the main pool together with the cattle class ;). \n\nSo what's the verdict? \n\nIf you like peace and tranquility at night, away from noisy frat kids, away from smoke, away from girls in four inch heels and rather far from casino, this is your place. \n\nOh and if you're driving... this hotel is awesome. They only do Valet and pretty fast. \n\nI will come back again.
