We actually plotted this lunch place as a destination as an excuse to ride our shitty crusiers and 1-speeds from Tempe to Phoenix on a lovely day.\n\nMy friend is a hardcore vegan, I am a lactose intolerant vegetarian so most lunch places are a straight-up bust for us. But after wandering through Washington St and the awesomely bike friendly Campbell for almost 2 hours, we were thankful for this place being open.\n\nI had never been to this plaza before, a very cool old school strip mall courtyard with unique tiled storefronts, interesting lunch places, well maintained desert landscaping with lots of seating around cobblestone and places easily to lock up our bikes. Entering the herb shop, the sight of sage brushes and herbs may be vaguely Gremlins like, but don't let its pure hippie-ness dissuade you! To the left is a display case of all kinds of small ornate chocolates (how exactly does coconut curry work as a vegan truffle?) with very 8th dimension names of the Chakras. Here is where you may start to panic. BUT-still don't! This place is busy! Mostly hippie moms who want their organic tea w\/organic local agave sweeteners and feeding their croc-ed footed little girls in hemp sweaters blueberry salad wraps, power lunches b\/w women with asymetrical haircuts and Ellen Fisher cardigans and the random hot guy who probably does a lot of yoga and watches feminist porn. BUT-enough of the crowd!\n\nSettling into outside while lots of adorable United Colors of Bennetton children ran around in ironic t-shirts (Lock your Girls up!) and playing with wooden toys, I think the waitress simply didnt see us. So we went in, got our menus a little grouchily (dude, if you have been riding your bike a long while, you get ravenous) and our waitress answered all our questions about the pumpkin soup, if the green tea was available decaf, if the bread had egg in it, etc. The food came much quicker than I thought it would. My soup (which I thought she gave me a bowl instead of a cup, that is how large the serving was!) was the Pumpkin special, dairy and meat free and absolutely perfect texture. It went well with their homemade walnut and cranberry bread as an accompaniment.  My friend got the Cowgirl wrap, half size which really is large! Trust me, it is the size of a regular wrap and came with spicy lentils and fresh greens and so many kinds of good stuff and she got the side of Quinoa which is truly savory and warm and good stuff as another reviewer stated. I had to help her with her wrap and I couldn't finish my cup of soup. So while her wrap was $11 and my soup was $6, we still had food left over and had to force feed each other lunch. Our special Mango Green tea, the iced tea special of the day, was refilled at no extra charge and refilled pretty often. She even indulged in a sunflower nut butter filled dark chocolate cup (like Reeses but hippied the fuck OUT) for $2.50, which seemed kinda steep but she loved it, so, there you have that. All the salads looked fantastic, but this is very strictly lunch affair of salads, soups, sammies, and wraps so keep that in mind when you come here.\n\nWe were able to bring our bill over to the spice store since my friend needed to get herbs (and organic cat nip) and add it to the bill so she didnt have to keep pulling out her debit card. The ladies working the counter had unfortunate tie-dyed shirts on but were very friendly without being Stepford about it.\n\nAs a lunch stop while you are at work, unless you get speedier recognition than we did, I wouldn't recommend it. This is a leisurely lunch spot (or take home). There were at least 8 kids running around in the court yard screaming, so that was a little jarring. While we talked, I realized our neighbors could acutely hear everything we were saying which made me slightly more self conscious.\n\nA little more proactive-ness would get this place another star and some nice outside seating for the restaurant.
