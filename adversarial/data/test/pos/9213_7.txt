Came here during the last day of Winterlicious.  Got lost trying to find the place in the freezing cold.  We walked right past it, did a half circle, and walked right past the street we were supposed to turn on and had to turn back (they renamed the street and Google Maps hadn't updated!).  It was cold and I was hungry but this place did not let me down.  The service was excellent, and their Winterlicious menu was very good.  The desserts were my favourite part and very delicious.  I did find it very hard to hear the group I was with though, I don't know if it was poor acoustics or I am going deaf.  For my own sake I'll blame the acoustics.  Its a really cool place inside and you can see the chefs busy at working cooking up a storm.  If you are a baller and loaded with cash you could probably eat here a lot (I would also advise you be my friend), otherwise I'd suggest going only on occasion as prices are pretty high.
