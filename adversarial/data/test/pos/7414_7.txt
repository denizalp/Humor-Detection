Not deserving of this 1 star.\n\nOrdered Furniture , paid and got an email that says \"We are out of stock and the manufacturer is as well. The manufacturer has discontinued the item and is no longer available.\"\n\nHow does this happen to a company claiming they \"Now , we have over 8,000 square feet of showcase over 100 furniture , lighting, and mattress manufacturers.\"\n\nWith so much square footage they don't know their \"High End\" furniture is out of stock, and further more to take it off their website? \n\nNever shopping there again, and telling my friends not to make the same mistake!!
