Since I started medical school at A.T Still University, students have been clamoring for a place to study. Sure there is the library and there is a Starbucks in the area, but the library closes early and well, Starbucks is Starbucks. The \"student\" knock on Gilbert is there aren't many places to study....which doesn't really work out too well if you are trying to be successful and not become an old man living in a van down by the river.  Bunna Coffee is student friendly, as it offers 20% of to students with ID. And yes, they even like the elderly - they get a 15% senior citizen discount - with which I'm assuming you can prove by showing them your wrinkles and cane.\n\nThere coffee house is extremely well spaced with plenty of comfortable seating. My girlfriend turned me on to this place and I stole some sips of her mocha. Definitely a good mocha. Smooth and sweet, and if you're worried about missing out on the Starbucks experience - don't worry the cost is about the same so you won't go through much withdrawal. But hey, being a student and saving 20% is still a good deal.  They do have smoothies and horchata here as well, I wanted a smoothie with a protein boost, but they said they wouldn't be getting any protein in for awhile so I had passed on that. I will be back to try it out though. \n\nBunna is independently owned and they specialize in organic and fair trade products. So hold your self righteous, non-corporate coffee loving head high with you fellow peers and give this place a shot. Support local coffee, I will be!
