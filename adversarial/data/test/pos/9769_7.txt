I'm not really a coffee drinker, but I love teas and smoothies. The Human Bean has so many different flavors to choose from. I had the pomegranate blueberry smoothie and it was nice cool treat to have on a hot day. Their mango peach tea was also very good and it wasnt to sweet or lacking any flavor. To top it all off, they give you a chocolate covered espresso bean which was a nice surprise because I actually liked it! Maybe I'll try some coffee next.
