This review is exclusively for the bubble tea.  I got a small lychee bubble tea there ($5.45) and overall it was ok.  I didn't taste any tea in it, so I think it was just milk and lychee flavouring.  It was rich and creamy.  It was also nice and smooth and not gritty.  I liked that it was really cold (I hate it when my bubble tea is lukewarm).  The tapioca pearls were ok.  They weren't hard, but they weren't as chewy as I like them.  Overall, not bad for a place that specializes in sandwiches and not actually bubble tea.  Incidentally, I saw that they have \"create your own salad bowls.\"  This looked really good and I may have to try it sometime :)
