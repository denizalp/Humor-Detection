Jenny's is still in it's 'soft opening', so the hours are different than posted, and there are a few things that aren't fully up-and-running yet - but I won't include those bits in my review. \n\nJenny's is meticulously clean. The first impression impresses! Clean lines and comfy seating, with a friendly welcome from the desk team. Instead of heaps of paperwork to fill out as a first time guest at other dispensaries, the team asked for our Medical and State IDs along with our phone number and where we heard about them. \n\nWe were brought back near-immediately and were surprised to see how small the showroom was. ...don't get me wrong - this is the one instance where small was a good thing. The cases were modern with glass, I love the display - you can tell they truly put some thought into it. Merch and paraphernalia are offered, which I appreciated - and you can actually touch the items before you purchase them (this shouldn't sound like a great concept - but it's something I truly appreciate). \n\nFirst time patients receive a 20% discount, which I am ALWAYS a fan of - but even better, all of  Jenny's strains are 50% off! Whaaaaaa? If you're a fan of Blue Dream (...and who isn't right now), you can purchase a 1\/4 (normally $60) for $30 - the usual price of an 1\/8!. I was super stoked that they offered AC\/DC, as we've been searching the valley for it for months!\n\nWe'll definitely be back to Jenny's, as the staff were helpful and super friendly. I even asked my 'I'm obviously a n00b, please don't make fun of me' questions, and they were super happy to help! Can't wait until they take debit and start a bag loyalty program!\n\nI'll update this review when everything is up and running.
