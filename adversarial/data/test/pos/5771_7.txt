I feel like its unfair for me to review Bund Shanghai because I was sick with allergies. I usually don't lose my sense of taste but everything seemed bland. So I'm not sure if it was them or me. Other than the soup being bland, I found it rather difficult to grab a dumpling without it sticking to the paper and ripping and all the delicious soup goodness spilling. Maybe it was my high expectations, I love soup buns. Being exposed to the best first with California's soup dumplings from Din Tai Fung (DTF for short) and Mama Lu's, Bund Shanghai had no chance. I'd come back a second time when I'm healthy and give them another shot. \n\nMy order:\nRegular soup dumplings \nCrab Soup dumplings \nShanghai style beef and rice rakes.
