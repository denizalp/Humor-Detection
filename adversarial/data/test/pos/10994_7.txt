Everything's more delicious when you're starving and nursing a hangover, right? With that said, I was in that state when my friends and I went there on a Monday morning for breakfast. \n\nIt was my first time there and I was pretty satisfied with their huge selection. With the way their buffet is set up, you pretty much have to walk from one end of the restaurant to the other. With our timing, we happened to catch the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch, which I was super excited about, being the foodie that I am. Haha. Sad to say that I got pretty full after my first plate, so I didn't eat much after. \n\nTheir selection of food has pretty good variety. The breakfast menu consists of everything from pancakes and French toast to Eggs Benedict and hash browns, and of course bacon and sausage. Their lunch menu is pretty decent, too. Their roast beef and sushi were delicious.\n\nThe customer service was decent. When my friend asked for orange juice, it took them a while to get it to her, but they cleared our plates in a timely manner. Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely come back and hopefully try some of their desserts. I was too full last time to get some. :(
