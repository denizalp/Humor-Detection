DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!  With that said by all means go try it and see for yourself this place is nothing more than a trendy overhyped overpriced waste of time.  I will say the Order via App option is solid and worked perfectly, food was ready promptly when promised and line was skipped accordingly.  \n\nSomeone said that this is the new best burger in Charlotte that is laughable at best.  I would obviously rank it above any of your big fast food chains, McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King etc etc it blows them away and it should.  It might be on par with 5 guys but for me falls below smash burger, hwy 55 and Culver's and wayback burgers which are your typical fast casual burger places and I feel offer a better product.  And I wouldn't even rank it with non chain places because it's not even in the same ball park.  \n\nI tried double shack burger, the fried chicken sandwich the cheese fries, cheese is on the side, and a orange creamsicle float.  First things first the burger, meat quality is good, it had a nice char on the meat, taste was slightly above average but I found it to be overly salty for my tastes.  Chicken sandwich was excellent but you will still find better at a Chick-fil-A, sauce they use on the chicken sandwich was very very good.  Fries were good, crinkle cut and crispy on the outside, slightly different crinkle cut than the super mass produced shape most places serve, cheese sauce was meh for me, glad it was on the side I didn't really like it, it's suppose to be a blend of American and cheddar I believe but overall just lacked flavor for me.  My orange creamsicle float consisted of them handing me a cup with a small amount of ice cream\/custard in the bottom and pointing me at the drink machine to fill it with orange soda, the order was to go I'm assuming if you dined in they might construct it for you but I could be wrong.  \n\nThere shakes which they are named after are $5+ which to me is laughable, now I don't mind spending money on food but to not offer any size option and have one price for a shake I think is kinda bad practice. My friend tried the shakes and said they weren't that good, they didn't even finish them and threw part of them out,  I will go back to try a shake just so I know for myself but I'm not expecting much.  \n\nI have to commend them on their hype\/advertising you would think it's the best food in the world and it was free if you just look at how busy they are and how long the line usually around the outside of the building is.  But for me that's all it was is a trendy overhyped place, if you want a better burger there are many many options available to you, and if you want a good milkshake for a lower price then you also have plenty of local options.  When I'm craving a burger I will go out of my way for a good place, this is not one of those places for me.  I will not say I'm never eating there again but I doubt I'll be back very much in the future just not worth it to me. \n\nI know food and I know burgers and this place is average at best, there are worse options and there are better options.  So go try it for yourself, form your on conclusion, and leave your own yelp review!
