I didn't really know what to expect coming to IKEA. We came in from out of town to get furniture for my BF's office.\n\nThe way you shop is confusing sorta because you have to write things down on a paper and then go find them in the warehouse, but once you figure it out it's no biggie. \n\nThe best part is when you think you're done shopping and you head down to get your furniture, YOU'RE WRONG!!! There's a whoooolllleeee bunch of household things in a labyrinth that you have to walk through to get to the furniture warehouse, and it pulls you in! You just wanna shop for everything in there! You gotta stay on your A-game to not spend all your money in there!\n\nI wish that we had an IKEA in Cleveland so that it wasn't such a hike to get things, but I'm sure I'll be back because it's too cute and too inexpensive to pass up.
