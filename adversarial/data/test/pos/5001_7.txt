Like the other people who reviewed this company, I too have been going to estate sales for quite a long time.  I also found them to be extremely rude and unprofessional.  I went to the same sale twice.  The first time I saw one of the staff rudely throw a family out because they had brought their kids in when they have a \"no children\" policy. Instead of telling them in a nice manner the staff member was loud and rude about it where it could be heard throughout the house.  A few minutes later when I was in another part of the house I saw that the family had snuck in the back door.  I told one of the staff that they were back (they did have 5 unruly kids) thinking I was doing the staff member a favor and was rudely told \"well what do you expect me to do about it\".\n\nSince they had a set of outdoor furnature that I was interested in part of, I decided to go back when they had less than an hour left until the sale was completely finished to see if it was still available and if they would break up the set.  Normally at the very end of a sale companies want to get rid of what is left, but apparently not this company.  When asking if they would sell the chairs seperate from the table I was treated like an idiot for asking.  (mind you at this point they weren't going to sell it at all since the saie was almost completely finished and there wasn't really anyone else there buying) This wasn't an unreasonable request, after all their JOB is to make as much money for the estate as possible.  Since I really wanted the chairs (they matched what I already had) I was willing to pay a fair price however I was told that not only would they not break up the set but if it didn't sell they were just going to LEAVE it for the people who just bought the house.  I am now thinking to myself WHAT!!  Their JOB is to make as much money for the ESTATE as possible.  I was then told that I could pay FULL PRICE for the set and then just leave the table since I didn't want it!!!  On top of that she tried to claim the amount the set was selling for was equal to the cost of ONE chair!  I KNEW this was untrue since I had purchased parts of the set already brand new.
