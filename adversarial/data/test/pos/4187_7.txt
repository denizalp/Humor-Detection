Well, I never thought I would, but I went back.  What can I say, they dominate the Eurosports in this city.  The guy at the clothing counter was up to his usual d-baggery by watching youtube, but the sales guys. ... Well well well.  They're alive and they were.. how do I say this... HELPFUL.  Upon entering we were greeted by a nice sales guy and then 5 minutes later.. another one!  I do get the feeling though that if a sale is in the works, you're basically on your own.  But luckily for me, I fell in love with a bike and had a great salesman to help me and answer my 1800 questions.  He was friendly, informative, and seemed to be genuinely interested in helping.  Needlesstosay, I left the god damn place with a bike.  I feel it was a great price, and they were happy to hold it for me until I could ride it home (early Spring).  I never thought I would see the day.  Jeff was an awesome salesman and I look forward to seeing how the maintenance\/mechanics service goes.  No one was more miserable than me about this place, but they earned the 17th chance and they redeemed themselves.  If they do have a bike you're interested in, go give them a chance, you just never know.\n\n*********Update***********\nI noticed a scratch on the mirror when I purchased it, but after I brought the bike home and inspected it more and more, I've come to realize the whole god damn bike was dropped.  There's a dent in the tank, scratches on the pegs and hand grips as well.  Fantastic.\nAlso, I ordered something from their accessories dept and I can't even type out the story because I don't want to relive it, but it was stupid.  It's a tragic tale of wasted time and efforts.  Order all of your motorbike needs online.  The only thing saving this place is the smiley fellow who works in the used bikes area.
