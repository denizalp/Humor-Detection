My new go-to lunch or snack place when I'm at work in the Cotton Center area. Good honest Chicago-style hotdogs (using Vienna Beef) with the traditional toppings: mustard, onion, relish, pickle, tomato, sport peppers, and celery salt -although you can tailor the toppings to your liking. Basic hotdog sandwich for $2.95, double dog for $3.95, pepper 'n egg sandwich $3.95, Italian beef $5.95; and all sandwiches include fries. A tasty meal, a great deal!
