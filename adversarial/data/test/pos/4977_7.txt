From the moment I call to make an appointment to the minute I leave, everything is handle professionally. So glad I found Dr Sharma. You do NOT find many doctors who truly care anymore but he does. Very understanding, really takes his time, goes through all options with you until you find the best solution & what works for you. The rest of his staff are attentive & helpful as well. Also same day appointments so I never have to wait to see be seen.
