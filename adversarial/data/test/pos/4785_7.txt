Well where do I begin. I've been to Tao at least about five times or so. Not once have I had a bad time there. I see lots negativity towards this place. So let's review. Venue is awesome. With bad\nAss asian decor,color,statues. Very nice. Restaurant is great, good food. Waiters are kinda lazy. But I enjoyed it. Yes, the club does get super crowded. But honestly what else do you expect. It's Vegas! I'm not sure about you people,but I'm from LA. To be honest a crowded club is far better than an empty club. Yes, the gorillas in suits aka bouncer,security,doorman,waitress, can be assholes. But, you gotta put yourselves in their shoes. These are working people who day in and day out. Deal with drunks,fights,theft,spilled drinks on them,and so much more. Sometimes they just have those bad days. Were only human. Shit happens. Yes, drinks are between 10 and 20 dollars. Once again were in Vegas. It's not your home town. With happy hour or whatnot. Expect to fork up some cash. If not drink up before you get it. It's not that big of a deal.\n\nI've read about dress code complaints. Really? Come on. Look I love dressing as comfortable as possible. Sneakers, jeans, a casual jacket. A t shirt or long sleeve. But honestly I don't mind throwing on a blazer or some slacks to go to a club. It's only a for a night. Plus you don't have to worry whether the bouncer at the door will second guess what your wearing. Ok as far as music goes. Yeah they can work on better dj,s. Or rotate music from hour to hour. It does kinda suck. \n\nOne thing I'll admit that is extreme, is prices for bottle service. Although I know it's vegas and I'm sure the prices stay around the same range at other various Vegas nightclubs. I'm not sure this is worth it. I'm not saying you have to be a millionaire,or a CEO of a corporation to get it. But the thought of spending a grand and up is disturbing. Yeah it's not for everyone. And I'm sure people even save for stuff like this. Bottom line you get what you pay for.
