In store experience: 5 stars\nDelivery experience: 2 stars\n\nFor the former, Sarah L and I visited the newly opened location at Broadview and got slices to stay. Counter girl Paula was very friendly and cheerful, although her lack of proper implements with which to open the glass bottle Coke they now sell here was troubling. Someone get this girl a bottle opener...how is this not part of the Pizzaiolo toolset??\n\nFor the latter, online ordering was a failure. The new location isn't yet programmed into the database (somebody update the XML, mmkay?) and as such it was pulling The Beaches store as my nearest location (closed at 10pm; I was ordering at 11pm) with an estimated delivery of...14 hours later. Hmm. So I called instead. \n\nThe person who picked up the phone answered with \"Hello?\" and I had to repeat my order a few times. She told me it'd arrive within 40 minutes, and when I asked her for the total, she said it'd be \"between $20 and $30.\" WTF.\n\nFast forward 90 minutes later and our pizza still hadn't arrived. Actually, so much time had passed that I actually forgot I had even ordered a pizza. It was almost 1am by this point, I was hungry as fuck and the store itself was about to close. Pizza finally arrived a few minutes later - the driver didn't ring the doorbell (as I had stated in \"special delivery instructions\" when I ordered the pizza) and had been standing there for god knows how long, knocking faintly on the door. Ugh.
