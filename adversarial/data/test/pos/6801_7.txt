Solid selection of craft beers updated daily (use TapHunter to be informed of the list) and simple but amazing comfort food. The burgers live up to the hype, the Attic wings (grilled) become a craving after having once, service is on point and overall the staff is great considering how busy they are on some days.\n\nIf you had a bad experience here, it's likely that you are a bad person.
