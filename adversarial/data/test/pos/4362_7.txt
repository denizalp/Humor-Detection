When talking about a Brazilian steakhouse, I think it bears repeating: my husband is Argentine.  His family is from Argentina, he spent part of his childhood there, and he LOVES meat.  So, when we were new to Ohio and told about Brasa, we were thrilled.\n\nSadly, the thrill didn't last.  \n\nOur company was delightful, the service was decent, the atmosphere was swanky, but the lighting was so dim it was a challenge to see what we were eating.. and each other, for that matter.  The salad bar was fun and interesting.  But, the meat (the main event).. most of it was overcooked!  The horror.\n\nMaybe it was because we came on a Sunday?  \n\nWe couldn't be sure, but sadly the meat wasn't what we expected.  For the price you pay, and the days you've given up eating so you can stomach your annual quota of animal flesh, you want it to be worth it.\n\nThe jury is still out on this one.
