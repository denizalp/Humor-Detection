I couldn't stop eating! Tom must have sold his soul to the devil cause this place is unreal.\n\nEverything about this place is awesome. It's in the MGM along other restaurants like Emeril and Wolfgang Puck but really stands out. \n\nThey recommend business casual but nothing is really enforced. The ambience is what you would expect. Dim lighting, bustling work flow and interesting things in the wall. Service was awesome. They have multiple people covering every aspect on service. My water glass was never empty! \n\nFood can't be explained in words. \nPrime Rib Grilled was to die for. Medium rare all the way! \nShort Ribs were soft juicy and juicy.\nSpinach was great. \nPotato puree is some black magic voodoo stuff. How is it that good. HOW!\nHen of the woods mushrooms were amazing. \n\nIn a city of a million places to eat, I'll make my way here every time.
