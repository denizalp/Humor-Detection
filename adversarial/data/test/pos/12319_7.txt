I had gone in earlier in the year to get a checkup and cleaning. The office was clean, and the staff seemed friendly. The thing that got me was the price gouging. I received a pretty hefty quote, and ended up paying for extras at the initial checkup. Got a second and third opinion later on, after needing emergency dental work from an accident.\n\nFolks, if you go here, and feel uneasy after a checkup or quote, I implore you to get a second opinion. I did. And like Geico, it saved me 15% or more.
