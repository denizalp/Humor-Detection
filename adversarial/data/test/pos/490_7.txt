I will start off by saying HATE is a very strong word. I normally do not use this word often but this time is an exception because this is the only word that describes how I truly feel about this business.\n\nI originally heard about Renter's Warehouse through radio ads on talk radio and news talk. I can't believe that my favorite news talk personality is promoting them. I was drawn to them because I had trusted this personality of which I won't name.\n\nI wasn't sure if I should rent or sell so I decided to call them and hear what services they offer. The initial meeting was awesome, Brandon Graham met with us, gave us great information about the services that they are able to provide, discussed the fees based on the renter's lease timeframe. We decided to move forward with it, Brandon came back to take photos of the property and did a walk through. We advised him there are things that we will agree to repair and many things existing are as is such as our water fountain, carpeting and closet doors. He said it should not be an issue. I also wanted to know if I have existing contractors if Renters Warehouse could work with them for repairs and he assured us that it will not be a problem.\n\nBefore I get to the next part of this....I never had any experience beings landlord to renters. We quickly moved out, shampooed the carpet and cleaned each room as soon as Brandon found a prospective renter looking to lease our home out for the next 2yrs.\n\nLow and behold, while away for a funeral, he calls and had told us the house needs to be further cleaned, carpet needs replacing, walls need to be filled in and painted?!!! WTF?! Am I selling my property or just renting the space out? My walls were fine, the renters had the opportunity to walk through the home and they were content prior to agreeing to lease the home. It baffles me that this never came up while we were going through the home together after he said it will not be a problem when we told him that there are things that we are not willing to do to rent.  I told him directly that he is providing us shitty communication when we were always providing him with updates and occasionally calling him to provide status of our move...mind you the day he called, the renter was supposed to be moving I later that afternoon! I told him well we had already discussed what we are doing and what we won't! If it makes it easier he can cancel the contract because my carpet is in good condition and there is no in hell way I will change out my carpets to appease him.  \n\nAnyways....from that day forward it has been pure hell. He refused to work with my contractors because according to him that would make him responsible for the contractor?! Uhhh didn't you say it will not be a problem to work with my preferred contractors? I call him, no answer, I text him and have received an answer 3 days later....typical excuse would be \"I had family issues\" \"I was out of town camping\" yadiyadiya......didn't you advertise 24\/7 property management?!! \n\nI complained to their corporate office, nothing done....long story short, I ended up managing my own property while Renters Warehouse charged me $80\/month for their services....they did absolutely nothing! Brandon Graham took 1 1\/2 months of rent for tenant placement which I do not agree with provided all the shit he put me through. Corporate office told me that Brandon is just the leasing agent and not the property manager....really? His name is on the monthly distribution taking my $80 fee for management fees! \n\nPlease beware of this stinkin company, stick with your gut, if it is too good to be true, it usually is. You will end up being deeply out of pocket for no services. Also, my renters lasted 2 months which I was a bit relieved because I wanted out since the beginning when Brandon failed to communicate and only escalated issues. Find an excellent communicator when trusting your property with another. You shouldn't have to be the one asking for updates or status on anything.
