I usually go to Hobak in Chinatown for some authentic Korean food. But it's too far away and increasingly I started visiting Moo Woo. The food is really good actually - delicious and authentic. Service is fast. Love the aesthetic of the place too. \n\nI'm super pleased there's such a good restaurant in our neck of the woods. Getting tired of boring chains
