Update: Okay, so I guess you can't update twice, but I thought I had to share this with you. \n\nHave you ever been so hungry that when you finally shoved a piece of food in your mouth you actually bit your finger?  No, you haven't?  Well, I just did that very thing.  Does this mean I have a problem?  I need AA for Essence Bakery.  I go there twice a week and now I'm biting fingers because I can't get the food in my mouth fast enough.  I obviously have a problem.  Please help me.  Someone needs to get rid of those damn Macarons before I'm forced to buy new jeans because mine are getting tight.  Yep, I've gotta do an Essence fast.  If you see me there ordering a Macaron, for the love of God stop me.  \n\nPrevious Update: I'm updating this baby!  I went to Paris a few weeks ago and had a Croque-Monsieur at this little bakery- DIDN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO ESSENCE!  I thought to myself, this crap sucks, I want Essence Bakery's version.  Whaaa.  Then I got over it.  I also can't stop myself from getting one of those treat boxes every time I  go.  I'm really in trouble here, good thing I started taking some new and exciting classes at the gym to counteract the damage.
