This place has the best Italian food in the city! The service is awesome, Chef Marc himself comes out to your table and with great detail, explains the items on the menu. \nMy top recommendations would be the Pork Chop El Chico, the Antipasto salad, minestrone soup (for lunch), and my favorite Linguine Cioppino! You cant go wrong with anything on the menu :)
