My wife refuses to go to this place but I like it because it is not busy like the Fry's across the street.  I don't like that you can't buy hard alcohol here and sometimes because it is so slow they run out of things like limes.  The prices are good and because it is new its clean and green.  They have the motion sensor lights in the cooler section so that they are not wasting electricity which is cool.  I didn't realize they don't have a butcher till I read Leslie R's review but I try to stay away from most of the fresh items here anyway since they don't do volume because its slow and that usually means that things aren't as fresh....which is why Pepper T's sushi was spoiled.  I will still rather go here than Fry's only because it is a mad house there.
