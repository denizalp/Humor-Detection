Was excited to try some interesting flavors that I saw in Yelp reviews, but none of the flavors were that great when I went. Most of the flavors I sampled were way too sweet, so I settled on Vietnamese Coffee. Average prices for ice cream, about $4 a scoop.\n\nOverall just an okay ice cream spot for me.
