Now I Empathy with Dave, The poor guy!\n\nI use to go to this place every week as a teenage with my friend. The Area has lot of nice Punk band, Metal T-shirt. As a rebellious hardcore punk kid, this was the PIT to fuel up on some cheap, stomach killer food where hygiene wasn't a necessity.  There dog's were always half decent but it felt like cheap hot-dog saucages, i mean, when you're trying to save money by getting the cheap sausage, Houston, WE GOT A PROBLEM! \n\nWhat's wrong except insalubrity all over the place?\nThe recipe for a good poutine is some good sauce which it's not the case: Extremly hot sauce properbly overcooked 20 times. Some greasy fries: One Shake to remove the Old 12213089 y o oil and BANG on the side ready to serve!\nThen a BUCKET (literally) of curd  cheese in the fridge. \nCurd cheese particularity is that the little milk (petit lait) is creating a salty and fresh squish-squish taste. By putting the Curd cheese in the refrigerator the little milk gets in the cheese and the effect is not longer there. The only thing that a not-hygienic restaurant can do easiely right is wrong here! \n\nThis franchise should be closed for insalubrity or simply for serving crap!
