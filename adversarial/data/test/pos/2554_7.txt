Very disappointing. Rib eye steak has 1\" of fat surrounding it. Brisket was mostly fat and sliced as thin as they could get it. The short ribs and bulgogi were good but the exact same as Costco bulgogi and loaded with fat. I do not call you his good meat. Good service but waaay overpriced at $56 for 2. I prefer the Japanese BBQ near the strip where the meat is waaay better and half the price. Ice cream is not included like at the Japanese BBQ. I will not return.
