This is a great place to load up on plants in the spring. They have a huge selection of all your favouite veggies and none of them look like they're about to drop dead as soon as you leave. I don't really buy flowers, because I'm mostly interested in things I can eat, but they seemed to have a good selection of those as well.\n\nThey have a modest selection of garden supplies, but I don't think that's really their thing. I asked if they sold any trellises to grow my veggies on and he told me \"Let them grow over the ground\". I said \"Yeah, but if I grow them up then I'll have more ground space.\" Then he looked at me a little annoyed and repeated himself. So, not the best customer service I've seen, but whatever just give me the plants.
