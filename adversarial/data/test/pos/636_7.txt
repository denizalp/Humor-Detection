I am a gym rat.  I go to the gym every day for 1 1\/2 to two hours.  I started hiking this trail regularly about 7 weeks ago.  It is not horrible, but it is not as easy.  Those switchbacks are killers.  The only thing that keeps me going is my mantra, when I am doing those damn steps.  I love that it is not a loop and if you are hiking with a group, people can hike at their own pace and what they can do.  The views are really pretty, but I am probably partial since I live practically around the corner.  I am glad I started this routine, but I am sure I won't keep it during the summer.
