Ive been here twice... in the same week.(guilty....) \n\nthe first time i walked in and it smelt heavenly!! i could smell the grills smoking away :) \n\ni love the retro interior... the silver and white tables and walls... i guess us blondes just like shiny things... who knows... \n\ni ordered a regular burger and a drink... the service was quick and orderly... i liked that there was a lot of room for people to wait and for those of us already seated don't have to have butts in our faces while we try to eat... that's a perk for sure... \n\nthe location isn't to bad either... and like i said its huge for being a burger joint on such a busy street.... \n\nthe Second time i went i had the turkey burger.... it was AMAZING!!!!!!! \nit didn't make me feel like i wished i hadn't .... it tasted in some ways better... and my favorite part of these delicious burgers is that they put RELISH on them as well and PICKLES!!!!! yum!!!! \n\nif i could... i would so eat here everyday.... mmmmmmmmmmmmm \n\n::drooling::
