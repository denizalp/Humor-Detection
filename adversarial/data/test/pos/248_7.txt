My experience with Leftwich Law was really great and better than I expected.  I was in financial hardship and I couldnt afford to pay my bills.  I had a free consultation with the firm and they guided and informed me of my options and what would be best for me.  They were very knowledgeable and they explained every step of the process as I had never filed bankruptcy before, this was all new for me.  They keep me informed during my filing and pretty much shared with me what to expect during the process and after.  All in all, I am very happy that I chose Leftwich Law as they were trustworhy, knowledgeable, and even very affordable!  They even gave me a payment plan!  Make sure you speak to these guys and you will be impressed.
