I love that crispy exterior that is characteristic of a real wood-oven cooked bagel, so I've eaten a number of them. I've been here a few times now and never had trouble with service, even mid-lunch. Luckily though I seem to catch them at a quiet moment most of the time and am the only one to be served. I picked up 6 bagels today and tried their spicy tuna salad as well; it reminds me of the interior of a spicy tuna sushi roll. I went home, slapped some cream cheese on an everything bagel and added some of the tuna salad on top - great combo. However, even a plain bagel is good if that's your thing, I'd probably have it toasted with butter at the very least.\nParking is really limited with the lot right in front and only a few spots reserved for this business (it's sort of a mini strip mall).
