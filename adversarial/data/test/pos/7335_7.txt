Checking in was quick and front desk agent was professional and friendly.  It all went down hill after that.  My husband and I are locals.  We stayed here July 21st & 22nd for our anniversary.  We like doing staycations and check out different resorts that our town has to offer. Our experience at The M was one of the worst we have ever had. The property is gorgeous.  Very clean and contemporary.  The room was spacious and had a nice view of the pool and The Strip. However the walls are so thin we could hear full conversations next door. Our neighbor rolled in at 3am sounded like 2 couples sharing a room. They were so loud. Sounded like they were having a party at 3am-5am. We called security to complain.  They did nothing.  Security and phone operator was rude and sounded annoyed that we called. They try to nickle and dime you about everything because they don't charge a resort fee. You have to pay $15 per person to use the hotel gym per day. $15 per day for Internet.  TV was poor quality, it kept freezing. Toilette paper was so cheap and thin it rips each time you try to pull it. Can almost see through them. Overall staff and service was horrible.  Servers at Jayde Fusion using slang to address us. Huddling and talking about other co-workers right next to us. Service at the pool was the worst. We waited 20mins in our chairs no waitress came by. They are all hanging out in the shade by the bar. We decided to walk to bar to start a tab. Waitress stopped us to see what we wanted. so we gave her our order and credit card to start tab. We returned to our chairs. 10mins later she returned with our drinks but forget 2 things that I asked for. After getting our drinks a friend joined us. We waited another 20mins waitress has not been by. We decided to go to the bar to get her a drink. This was a Tuesday the pool was not busy. Waitresses were slow, lazy and was not friendly or personable at all. The bar staff was OK. In the afternoon we got hungry I went to the pool grill to order some snacks. I asked cashier if I could charge to my room she said I needed ID. I said Oh ok let me go to my chair and get it. I quickly returned with my ID and grill was closed. How rude. That was the final straw that made me hate this place. I will Never stay here again and I will make sure to tell everyone I know about this horrible experience.  Shitty service can not be forgiven. Sorry M Resort I was really hoping to have a nice enjoyable anniversary,  you failed at providing that.  Worst staycation ever!\n\nPros: clean and contemporary resort and nice relaxing pool\n\nCons: shitty service, shitty service, shitty service, thin walls, cheap toilet paper, uncomfortable bed, extra charge for everything
