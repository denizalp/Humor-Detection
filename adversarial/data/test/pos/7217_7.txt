Contemporary decor matched with diverse selection of  trendy, modern interpretations of Japanese food.  A great combination.\n\nThe food is bold.  Flavors always pronounced.  No dish is overly delicate and it works perfectly in a social setting with good drinks and great friends.  It is a running theme at social house that you should be social.  Share your food.  Portions are large and with the exception of mains are plated to be shared.\n\nThe cold starters are all very fresh.  Top props to the yellow tail. Each piece topped with a jalapeno slice, micro cilantro, a hint of garlic (garlic dust), and a tart but salty calamansi soy.  The subtle flavor of the fish is quickly lost but its texture is the perfect foil to the bold flavors.  The toro tartar is also worth a try.  Love the texture from the arare (Japanese rice crackers).\n\nThe rock shrimp tempura starts the list of great hot dishes. Sweet shrimp surrounded by a fluffy yet crisp outside and served with a spicy ponzu dipping sauce.  Perfect with any drink.  The citrus peel miso cod in a lettuce cup is phenomenal.  Deeply infused miso flavor and a juicy peace of fish.  Add the sauteed foie to it and the richness will blow your mind.\n\nSushi? The crispy eel, shrimp tempura, avocado, with a spicy aioli and teriyaki unagi sauce make for GREAT eats.\n\nSeveral visits and the food never disappoints.\n\nService is very good and never intrusive.\n\nAlthough there is a good and fairly priced wine list,  its more fun sampling their cocktails and matching it with the food.\n\nNote: Sure you can dine here alone but that wouldn't that be antisocial?\n\nRecommended.
