Y'all got to know that the Nobu isn't a free-standing hotel; it's actually a wing inside of the Caesars.  I'm between 3-4 stars here and I'm not really sure why I decided to round up.\n\nCompared to the hotel scene in Vegas, I'd say that Nobu is pretty nice, but it's NOT boutique by any stretch.  I wouldn't put it at the top-top (if you're looking for ultra luxury, then the yuppie clientele alone kills it), but I suppose it must be nicer than staying in the Caesars Hotel itself. \n\nBasically, you walk into to the semi-exclusive area with its own little lobby area (right across from the Nobu restaurant) and key-card access.  You'll arrive to a lovely room outfitted with a pretty swanky bathroom, a sweet vanity area, robes and slippers.  One little booo hoooo:  My bathroom didn't have a bathtub, sadly :( \n\nWhat I do love about the Nobu hotel is that it's located inside Caesars Palace.  Yes, it's by default, but it does get them some points.  I loved walking right down to the restaurant, being steps away from that fabulous shopping area inside of Caesars, and I actually do like that I didn't run into too many people on my floor.  Huge plus.\n\nHere's what I don't like about this hotel:  THE SERVICE.  I mean, I know it's Vegas (not Northern Cali), but I do think it's ridiculous to have to call down to the front desk more than once to ask for things like water and a package that I was expecting. BTW, the hotel attempted to charge me for that Fed-Ex package without telling me. Ridiculous.  My final pet peeve: NO FREE WIFI in this joint.  That really irritates me.  It always makes me feel like I'm in some cheap hotel when they charge nightly prices like this and wifi isn't free (I think normal prices are like $400-$500\/night to stay here).  \n\nNet net:  Like Nobu, love Cromwell.
