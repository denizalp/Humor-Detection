I came here twice. Both times I've had unacceptable service.\n\nThe first time I ordered a chicken burger. They accidentally cooked a beef burger. When I pointed this out, they threw it in the trash and proceeded to make a chicken burger. I've had incorrect orders at places like KFC, and they will let you keep the incorrect order as well as give you a replacement to make up for the lost time. I pointed this out and they shrugged. The chicken burger patty was obviously a supermarket patty.\n\nThe second time, I ordered a smoked meat poutine. They charged me for a normal poutine. After the transaction was complete, the cook realized his error and demanded more money from me before he began cooking. It was his mistake, but I guess they're super stingy. The poutine was mediocre. Cheese wasn't fresh, and the gravy was so-so.\n\nI won't be back here.
