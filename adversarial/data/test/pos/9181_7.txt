Burger King just needs to take a look at what other fast food places are doing with breakfast and incorporate some of the same practices! One of the most frustrating things is that they stop serving breakfast at such an odd time of 10:30 AM and when people like me who would enjoy French toast sticks at a later time can't get them it's annoying. My most recent experience at this particular location was what even inspired me to do a review. I was in the drive thru line at approximately 10:18 AM and of course sat there for about 7-10 minutes which put us super close to the ending of breakfast. When I finally was able to order the woman who was taking the drive thru orders tried to tell me no more breakfast when in fact it wasn't even 10:30 AM. The last thing I want to do is sit up and argue with somebody this early in the morning about some damn French toast sticks so that was really annoying. Anyways the manager end up having the kitchen drop a fresh batch of French toast sticks for me because technically I was correct I got in that line prior to 10:30 AM and even placed my order BEFORE the time that they claim breakfast stops. All this could've and SHOULD'VE been avoided by simply doing like McDonalds, Jack In The Box and the others and offer ALL DAY BREAKFAST.. Period!
