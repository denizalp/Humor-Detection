It is a park. It is in the extreme Northwest. There is a baseball diamond. \n\nThese facts alone warrant a 4-star. \n\nThe fact is that human beings should not be permitted to settle this far in the valley (certainly not outside of the beltway loop), so there should be no park up here. But there is. Unfortunately, they are even adolescents -- with no lives -- who enjoy hanging out here late night. (Yes, I am that grouchy old man.)  \n\nIts existence is a mixture of miracle that they would even bother providing public parks this far away the city centre, and, supporting evidence of appalling, unrelenting, suburban flight. \n\nThe sprawl is real. Nature has no hope against the parasitic cancer known as man. Poor Rango. - E
