My Wife introduced me to Cathy's Rum Cake about 18 years ago. It was the first time I had ever heard of it. I LOVED the incredible creation! Every year since I ordered her a Rum Cake from Cathy. This year, around March I was left with the option to buy a Rum cake from Lisa. I figured....it's a family business so the recipe would be similiar if not exact. Now, they may be, but something is definately missing and that is, well......EVERYTHING! \n The cake I ordered was so bad! We literally each took two bites. The first was awfull. The second was to make sure the first bite was not a Fluke. It most def. was not a fluke. The filling was sour\/bitter. Not spoiled though. The cake was gummy and dense. The frosting tasted like cool whip. Nothing close to what I first tasted 18 years ago and enjoyed almost every year since. Plane and simple...the cake sucked so bad that I am going to leave you with a quote from a current pop song! \"We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\"!
