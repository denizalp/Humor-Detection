Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be trapped inside the head of a Mexican tripping on Ecstasy? Well, now you can experience it first hand without worrying about your heart exploding. \n\nWhen you're craving Mexican - I'm talking real, authentic un-Americanized Mexican served in a place where you can break out your rusty high school Spanish skills- there are quite a few good options in the city. We normally head over to El Tolteca in Biddulph Plaza or Mi Casita (formerly Mi Pueblo) on Lorain, but on this evening we were feeling adventurous. At least adventurous for us.\n\nYeah, it's on the fringes of gentrified Cleveland. You know, the place where the real, working class Clevelander's live. It's far from the maddening crowds and the trying-to-hard 20-somethings and their \"like\"-filled rants about their boring white people problems. It's on a corner connected to a house and it has a brightly lit sign planted in the lawn.\n\nThere was a guy sitting on a chair by the kitchen door, maybe the owner?, and he greeted us with a welcoming smile and friendly hello. As soon as we walked in we knew it would be a trip to remember, for better or worse. Remember the aforementioned Mexinsanity? This is where it starts. The small dining room was filled with the deafening sounds of trumpets, nylon-stringed guitarras and \"ahas\" from maniacal mariachi. I'm not exaggerating. We actually had to raise our voices to talk over it.\n\nTables covered in clear, vinyl. Black and white checkered floor tiles. Orange and green paint. Paper flags hanging from the ceiling. Plastic flower arrangements. But the showcase is definitely the trio of paintings adorning the wall directly to the right as you enter. Flanking a large painting of flowers in a vase are two images. The first depicts a headdressed warrior, shield in hand standing valiantly in front of a giant eagle. The other shows a bow-wielding Montezuma standing over what appears to be a woman, laying asleep (or dead) in flowers. Trippy.\n\nThe food is your typical unadulterated Mexican fare. Burritos, tacos, tamales, tostadas, a smattering of seafood selections, rice, beans, asada, pollo, camarones, puerco and various combinations of the above. You can order lengua (that's tongue) as a meat option. Don't be frightened. It's really good. \n\nWe sampled several dishes, all of which were tasty. Chorizo tacos, simple and cheap ($1.99 each), the chicken burrito was OK, not stellar, filled with white meat chicken, lettuce, guac, onions, tomato, I expected more heat and spice. Seemed a little bland. The cheese quesadilla served with refried beans and rice was also good. Hard to screw up melting cheese in a tortilla. Some of the best beans I've ever eaten, though. My wife dug her pastor tostada - crispy, fried shell topped with grilled veg and tender pork.\n\nFor a couple of gringos it scratched our itch for Mexican food. Service was pretty slow, noticeably so, but friendly. We had no trouble polishing off the chips and salsa (both pretty good) while we waited. No booze here, just canned pop and some Mexican soft drinks. They do have horchata. Try it. And save room for tres leches cake. We didn't and I was bummed. Should have gotten it to go.\n\nOthers have pretty much nailed it. It's nothing fancy, no pretension, just the real deal served by the real deal. I'm not sure we'll dine in again but for Mexican take-out I put Las Dos Fronteras pretty high on our list.
