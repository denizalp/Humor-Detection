I love this Vons because I never have to worry about the wandering hobo in the store. The downer is the number of registers-never enough of them open! Wonderful service and love the ORGANICS products especially the .99 cent White Tea and Peppermint flavored ice-tea (individual bottles).  Refreshing for a hot summer day!
