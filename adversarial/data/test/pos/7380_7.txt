One hour wait. Okay this place has to be somewhat of a decent AYCE sushi. No. Just honestly go next door to Soyo and save your $27 bucks. \n\nWe finally sat down and didn't see the waitress again for another 15 minutes. We ordered a couple random rolls, a bunch of sushi, and appetizers. \n\nSo the rolls we're just rolls. I'm not really a fan for rolls. The food runner finally gave us sushi and didn't even know what was what. \n\nFood runner: Heres your octopus...\nMe: Thats not octopus. \nFood runner: oh sorry, red snapper. \nMe: That's not red snapper. \nFood runner: Ohh.... *walks away... \n\nIt was actually surf clam. Learn your sea creatures if your going to work at a sushi place! \n\nThe sushi was not fresh. All of them were small and slightly fishy. The uni was literally orange brown and tasted so weird I couldn't eat it. \n\nI think then only thing I enjoyed was the miso soup. \n\nService needs to be a lot better too. I know now the only reason why we waited a hour was because they took forever to clean the tables around us!
