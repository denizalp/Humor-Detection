We ate at this particular restaurant located in the Stratosphere Hotel because we had a coupon for a free pitcher of beer with the purchase of a pizza. Our pizza was delicious. This small restaurant only serves pizza and beer. All the pizzas are large or you can order a slice. I would definetely return to this little restaurant, especially if we find another coupon  ((:
