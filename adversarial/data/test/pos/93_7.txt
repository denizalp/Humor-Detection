I came here last summer with a group of friends I hadn't seen in a while and we thought it'd be fun to have a girls afternoon.  We too, should have known better, and had succumbed to this Groupon thing. \n\nWe were first greeted by a lady who was very courteous and we were offered a glass of plain water.  Shortly after, we were led to separate rooms to start our experience.  Our groupon entailed a 30 minute massage\/facial and a manicure & pedicure. \n\nThe massage and facial were definitely both extremely mediocre.  I felt like I was being tickled more so than massaged the whole time.   I also felt that the facial was just random lotions splotched on me for short periods of time.  I definitely felt neither refreshed nor cleansed after these.  \n\nThe mani & pedi were also just as mediocre.  We had some girls do a very messy job on both the hands and feet.  I had nail polish on outside of my nails in multiple fingers and toes.  They also didn't let us fully dry before letting us go resulting in chipped polish very soon after.  Instead of wiping away the whole nail and starting again, they used a bit of polish to just \"fill the chip\" and it looked completely like a botch job. \n\nOverall, I realize that this was a Groupon thing but I just experienced another spa recently and it was also on a \"Spa Week\" promotion and 10 times better.  I would definitely never pay full price to this place and even if there was another Groupon, I would still not go again.
