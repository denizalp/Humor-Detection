Tough to assign a value because I've had mixed experiences here but I lean towards the higher values because the good had been quite good.\n\nI adore the hair stylists here.  It's rare to arrive with my mom and we both walk out with the best hair in recent memory.  \n\nI've had facials, pedis and manis here.    I liked the facial I've had here (she even tweezed my brows for free because they were getting a bit scraggly)  manis\/pendis were professional and sanitary with adequate pampering to make them great.   I'm very picky about nail sanitation and technique but I approve.    I did have a nail tech that was quite rude (when I mentioned it to the receptionist I got an apology from the tech and the experience improved.  \n\nBooking has been a bit of a challenge and not always convenient to my schedule even in advance but that's probably a testament to how successful a business they really are.
