*Endless Apps for $12 Review* Out of my own volition, I uncharacteristically sought out TGIF to get the endless appetizer special because I was starving, and the fat girl in me thought this was a good idea for dinner on a Friday night. For all interested parties, you can only order 1 app at a time. \n\nBRUSCHETTA: Definitely the best appetizer out of the 3 I tried. A little heavy handed on the balsamic vinegar, but the bruschetta overall was tastier than I expected! I liked that the bread wasn't the usual crusty kind of bread. 3.5\/5\n\nMOZZARELLA STICKS: The cheese didn't taste fresh or real enough. They were just barely okay. 2.5\/5\n\nLOADED POTATO SKINS: Is this even edible food fit for human consumption? I asked for no bacon, being a vegetarian and all, and what was served in front of me was appalling. The potato didn't taste like a potato and the nacho cheese tasted old. I could barely stomach one bite. Plus, I found bacon bits on the bottom of some of the potatoes! I think they messed up on my order and tried to reserve me the same potatoes. Gross! 0\/5\n\nSERVICE: Started off slow but once our waitress showed up she made sure I had lots of apps coming in one after the other. Refills took longer to get than I would've liked and plates weren't cleared that fast either. 2.5\/5\n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nHells to the no. This recent visit was TGIF's last shot at winning me over. After consistently being disappointed in their food, I'm giving up on this chain completely.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #50
