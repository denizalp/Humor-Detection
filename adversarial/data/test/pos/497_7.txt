I love the swanky, Ocean's 11\/13 feel of this place. If only I had been noshing with Danny Ocean instead of on a business trip :)  \n\nEach of us had the chopped salad (yowza!) and split a couple of small plates including the truffled grilled cheese & the tomato and goat cheese casserole (double yowza!).  \n\nI had to grab several match books on the way home, so just in case any of my friends are at my house when I light a candle - - they will know just how swanky I roll!  LOL!
