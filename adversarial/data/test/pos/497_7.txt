I looked forward to my meal here--and for good reason.\n\nA Shrimp Cocktail featured large shrimp that were quite good and meaty, and Tuna Tartare was nicely seasoned.  Although I found both Oysters East & West from the environs of Canada appealing, I liked East the best.  All were fresh, and tasty adorned with a choice of 3 sauces.  \n\nCezar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves was very tasty, followed a long time later by an unusual Beef Stroganoff derived from Short Rib, accompanied by interesting cut up pieces of Mini Baked Potatoes.  Stuffed Maine Lobster was a big hit at our table.  The majestic crustacean was filled with shrimp, crab, and herb stuffing, and a silky Butter Sauce was placed close by for easy dunking.\n\nService was very good.  And, the ambiance was both intimate and convivial.  Even though a fabled Ice Bar is on premises, the food and service here can justify a visit on their own merits.\n\n4-1\/2 stars overall!
