Stayed here with the wife for her 40th birthday last weekend.  Nice place but not quite on the level of a Wynn resort.  Encore makes you feel like a VIP the second you walk in the door.  Aria doesn't feel quite the same.\n\nThe place is nice, very modern looking and clean.  The room was well appointed with qood furnishings but it was a tad small.  We didn't eat at the resort other than having a late night snack at the 24 hour cafe.  It was decent but the music from Haze on a Thursday night was vibrating the floor and walls!  Friday night there was an outdoor club, acorss the way (Marquee I think) that was audible through the window.  Luckily we had already been out partying so I was pretty tired and getting to sleep wasn't a problem.\n\nThe pool was great but they must put some crazy chemicals in there because my eyes were KILLING me a couple of hours later.  The gym is top notch, just about every kind of machine you could want.\n\nThe shopping over at the Crystals is insane!  Not many people there but then again who has the money to shop at Fendi, Dolce & Gabanna or Hermes?  It was prety funny seeing all of the shop employees with nothing to do.
