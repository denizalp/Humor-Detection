Ok I hate doing this, but I wasnt wowed at all. \n\nI had never had rice pudding in my life so I didnt have any ideas of what it should taste like. \n\nThe rice pudding was very bland, I would actually never eat it again. \nThe dude in that day, was very very nice and helpful. I give the service 5 stars but the food 2 stars. \n\nAn example is I hate cupcakes but ate one at this place because I was starving, and I fell in love. \n\nThis place made me realize rice pudding is bland and not something I want to eat again\n\nit wasnt vomit enducing so thats good. but all in all not worth a trip. \n\nI was hoping for a new treat discovery. \n\nsomething else that was a turn off was the unsanitary looking plastic containers that look like tupperware they keep the pudding in. \n\nIf I could change one thing it would be that, i almost didnt eat there because it looked kinda gross. \n\nBut they get a 3 because i didnt want to puke and the service was good. \n\nMy girlfriend who loves rice pudding said it was bland and didnt eat half of the kids size. She said it was very average. \n\nI hope they make some changes and kick up the rice pudding, like try it colder or more flavorful?  \n\nsorry but i wont be back
