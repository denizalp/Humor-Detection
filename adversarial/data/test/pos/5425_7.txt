I love Mexican Food. Better yet, I love good,great Mexican food. Maybe we came on a good night. But, I was very happy with what we got!\nThis was my first time here. Though Mario has been here many times.\nThe Chips and Salsa were very good and they refilled them for us several times. I got the shredded meat, even though I am not a huge meat eater, this was very tasty and I would order it again.\nIt seemed like it had been cooking all day. So it was tender and very tasty with whatever type of spices they put in.\nLots of food of course ,I had to get the rest to go. The server was very pleasant and the restrooms are clean. It was a tiny bit cold inside but, that is better than being hot. So I have to say I really like it and would go back any time.
