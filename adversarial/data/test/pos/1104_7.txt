Hi my name is Roxy and I am a hot wing addict. I get it, I am a petite, blonde haired female. Typically that and hot wings don't go together. My mother would disown me if she knew that her only daughter ate with her hands, goes through more napkins and ranch dressing than any female ever should and joined what is supposed to be a boys only club. But don't fret mother, I still can't drink a beer, all hope isn't lost!\n\nSo being the wing addict that I am, I have searched high and low for wings - and I frankly really hate to admit this, but Buffalo Wild Wings has some legit good chicken wings.... besides they have more flavors than a Baskin Robbins.\n\nBesides, they have every game on known to man and a huge selection of beer (which is ahem every mans dream), the place is super kid friendly and they have great cocktails to drown away any pain and torture your wife, girlfriend, secret girlfriend, want her to be your girlfriend is enduring by being forced to watch professional sports.\n\nBut for me... Really it's simple - I come for the wings!
