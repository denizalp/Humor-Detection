It is said that America is an idea. For this reason, I've long believed that Las Vegas is the quintessentially American city--unmoored from any specific reality, yet a phantasmagoric facsimile of many of them. Las Vegas embodies artifice, but it also suggests something else: that the imagined is more essential than the actual. You don't have to be in New York City in order to \"spend all your money\" or \"eat at Rao's\" within view of the \"New York skyline.\" You don't have to be a race car driver to drive a Ferrari around a track at warp speed. You don't have to convince an actual person to be in a relationship with you to... well, you get the picture. \n\nGuy Fieri, auteur of the Vegas mileu (and creator of Vegas Fries(TM)) knows this instinctually. Little surprise then that the man is well-represented in this town, including by the savagely brilliant Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar.\n\nA waiter rolls up to your table bearing a small trash can of nachos and some spicy margaritas. As you wonder how your grubby little fingers will reach the cheesy, barbecue-blasted goo at the root of this heapin' helpin' o' chips, voila! -- the bottomless can is snatched away, leaving a dare-I-say perfect cylinder of slightly-sweet yet tasty nacho.  \n\nEver had a burger spackled with SMC (that's \"super melty cheese\" to the uninitiated)? If you've been to Flavortown you have. Is that burger \"the best in Las Vegas\" (as voted by SEVEN magazine, whatever that is)? DNDC (that's \"don't know \/ don't care): What I do know is that along with SMC, that burger has mac n' cheese, bacon, LTOP (I'm not spelling that out; keep up) and the inimitable Donkey Sauce(TM) all over it, and it goes down just fine before or after a (once again slightly sweet) Fireball Whiskey Wing. Oh, and for real, don't eff with that spicy margarita. \n\nChilaquiles? Now? It seems counterintuitive, really, but if you've been up till 8 a.m. blastin' your schnozz with 'caine and\/or hip-thrustin' to the block rockin' beats of Tiesto, then 3 p.m. on a Thursday is Vegas Brunch O'Clock, my friend. And these chilaquiles, to be truthful, are the best looking plate I've seen from this joint yet. \n\nYou can dine outdoors at Guy's Vegas Kitchen, and you ought to -- the better to drink in the corporate colossuses stacked around you, punctuating that dry desert air soaked with the smell of money ill spent. Should this plate of nachos cost twenty bucks, a plate of ribs north of thirty? Nah. But by Vegas logic -- nay, by Flavortown logic -- it not only should, but it must. For if there is one idea that (T)rumps all others in America, and in the most American city, it is extraction. Capitalism is both engine of and raison d'etre for American freedom. Vegas takes that capitalism, stuffs it in a fake-bottomed trash can, slathers it with cheese sauce and barbecued meat, and charges you twenty bucks for the privilege of stuffing that bad boy in your mouth. Vegas takes capitalism to Flavortown. \n\nAnd as Vegas is to America, so, then, is Flavortown to food. It is a place that connects us without connection, that unites our people behind a vague, occasionally multiethnic, promise of familiar abundance. It is any America: a Texas roadhouse, a Midwestern diner, a BBQ joint, a dive bar. It is, in an often lonely city that is somewhere yet nowhere, a home.
