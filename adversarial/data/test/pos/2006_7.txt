The pho here is quite good! On a cold winter's night, this restaurant definitely hits the spot. Good, clean tasting broth. Selection of fresh or dry noodles (be cool, choose the fresh!). Updated decor, which lovely high ceilings and some funky lighting that makes the experience much less \"fast food\" than some pho places.\n\nI ordered the medium P1 ($7.50) which is the special beef pho, and it came in a fairly large bowl.I love that they have S\/M\/L large choices, as some places only give you option for S\/L. What if I'm HUNGRY BUT NOT THAT HUNGRY, HUH?? We also tried the spring rolls, which was $10.50 for a large plate, definitely large enough to share among 4 people!\n\nExcellent place, will definintely be back!
