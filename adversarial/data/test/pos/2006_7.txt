SUNDAY NIGHT = NIGHT SWIM.\n\n- Crazy, crazy party.\n- EDM.\n- Come in your bathing suits.\n- Ride giant floating dragons, swans, sharks earlier in the night.\n- Later in the night, only the beach balls remain.\n- Towel table constantly stocked with dry towels. Yay\n- Ladies, get on the right guest list and get 2 free drink tickets.\n- Amazing energy and music.\n- Best party all weekend.\n\nP.S. Don't book the first flight out on Monday morning to make it back to work in LA. Bad idea.
