A handful of friends recommended Dilworth Tasting Room. It took me a while to make it but I am glad I did! They have awesome indoor and outdoor seating areas. If it's warm out I would definitely recommend the patio. I would ALSO recommend the meat and cheese plates! They have a great selection of delicious cheeses and meats! Awesome food, great wine selection, top notch service, and an amazing atmosphere, if you haven't been you should definitely check it out.
