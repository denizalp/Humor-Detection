I have never eaten at Smoky's. This is a review of Smoky's as a Martini Bar.\n\nAs a martini bar, it is freaking awesome. There are 90 \"Martinis\" on the menu. They are all $10. What I love is that the charming and talented bartender, Bob, pours all the extra booze into a side glass for you. In short, these are stiff, well mixed, large martinis with top notch ingredients. \n\nRemember, Winston Churchill said, \"Martinis are like breasts. One is not enough a three is too many.\" Please drink carefully! I've seen people make poor decisions after their second Smoky's martini, and I, personally feel that 3 martinis at Smoky's could land me in the hospital. \n\nI agree that the atmosphere is a little questionable for an expensive meal, but for martinis, it's great. Dark with unobtrusive music.
