Never will I return to Groggy's again, and I love dive bars. The 1 Blue Moon I drank made me sick, bartender ignored me, the other customers made me feel like I was going to be attacked in the parking lot. A place I felt unsafe, and completely disturbed by the whole scene. I had to use the ladies room, what a flippin nightmare, maybe the owners could stop buying new gadgets and gizmos and put a little attention into the most basic thing there is in a bar, the bathroom. Or even better yet, since this is the valley of the sun, maybe just maybe they should invest in new AC units. Too hot in there, that may of been the cause for me feeling ill. Either way this is a warning to the public DO NOT EVER GO, JUST DONT GO.
