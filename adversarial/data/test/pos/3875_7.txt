\"The best kept secret in Vegas\" is what I heard upon my arrival into Sin City. Sad to say...let's keep it that way. Upon reviewing the Yelp page for this buffet, there's a little blurb saying Vegetarians go nuts for this place. Why?! There's literally nothing a vegetarian can eat except fruit and salad. Even the waffles and pancakes have animal products in them. \n\nAs a vegetarian I ate the salad bar, which was decent and deserving of a 2nd star. The miso soup was disgusting and my boyfriend said the pancakes were gross. For $12.99 you can get unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's and margaritas. Keep in mind the alcohol they use in these is cheap and will leave you feeling not so hot after. The orange juice used tasted like minute maid. The food doesn't seem to be quality either. \n\nWe had pretty decent service except for the lady at the fruit bar who couldn't seem to understand that I wanted mixed berries despite the fact I told her 4 times. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this at all. The $20 per person is better spent utilizing room service or going to an actual restaurant.
