Owwwwwww.  That's how my butt felt when waking up yesterday morning. And I owe the pain to my previous day hike at Pinnacle Peak.  \n\nI consider myself to be in pretty good shape- i weight train, spin, kickbox, or do something active pretty much everyday. But nothing compares to hiking because it's a great workout, you don't even feel like you're working out (until you wake up with the butt pain the next morning) and mountains excite me after growing up in Florida.  Unfortunately, there are no mountains to hike in Chicago so when my hostess with the mostess, Gabi K, suggested we wake up early to hike Pinnacle Peak I was all for it. \n\nIf I lived in Phoenix I'm guessing you could find me hiking Pinnacle Peak on a weekly basis. The view from the mountains is absolutely breathtaking and it really is the perfect hike...steep enough at times so you get out of breath, but nothing that's going to kill ya. The entire hike took us about 1 1\/2 hours although those crrraaazzzzyyy peeps who run the hike are probably done in half that time.
