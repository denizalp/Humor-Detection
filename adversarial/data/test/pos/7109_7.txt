I did some of my maintenance since 2008. It is always busy, so call for appointment at least 2 weeks ahead. The work has been good and expensive. Seems like they change the manager for part\/service recently. My last service in June was not a nice story though, for a recall and a oil change.\n1. They went to wrong address to pick me up after the work, which costs more than 1.5 hours and force me to change the schedule for the rest of my day.\n2. The car was not washed as they normally did.\n3. They did not honor the oil change coupon.\n\nOverall, it has been OK, despite the latest visit. It may be just a bad day for me.
