Master Engine is a great company new to the Phoenix area. I have a 2003 Dodge Ram with over 252,000 miles on it. The engine was tired and started to burn quite a bit of oil and would put out a puff of white smoke upon accelerating from a stop. I found Master Engine after contacting 8 other engine shops. Akram at Master Engine is a great guy and knew exactly what the issue was. He recommended rebuilding the engine and gave me a price to complete the job. The price was the best out of all the shops I had gotten quotes from. Akram then proceeded to tell me they have a 3 YEAR UNLIMITED mile warranty. I thought this was too good to be true but decided to have them rebuild my engine. I dropped my truck off on Saturday morning and picked it up the following Friday morning. The truck ran great until I hit about 200 miles and then it began to have oil pressure issues. I called Akram and he told me to bring it in. Akram had his mechanics inspect the engine and told me they would have to keep it to inspect it further. As it turns out, the new oil pump that had been installed was defective. Akram and Master Engine replaced the oil pump and the crankshaft with no issues. I have put about 1000 miles on my truck since getting it back and it runs great! Master Engine is a great company that stands by their work. I recommended Master Engine to a friend who took his 2005 GMC Yukon there to have the engine rebuilt without any issues. I highly recommend Master Engine, they have the best prices, the best warranty and they are honest and stand by their work!
