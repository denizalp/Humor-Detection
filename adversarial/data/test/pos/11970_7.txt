Where do I start? I really didn't enjoy my experience here at all when I first walked in I went to the hostess and we looked at each for about three seconds before I said hello. Wth? Why am I greeting you? I don't work here you do. Anyway she said seat anywhere and someone will help me.\n\n I sat across from her then I noticed she was waiting for people to say hello to her first. Who does that? I order just a regular shake because I'm at a fan of alcoholic milkshakes. I good the banana split and it was just alright nothing really special. I probably wouldn't come back here.
