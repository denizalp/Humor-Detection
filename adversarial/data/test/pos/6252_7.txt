Like most of what everyone on here has said, the service stinks. Our waitress could have had more of a personality or perhaps practiced a little more on that fake smile to be more genuine-looking. She was a little rushed & not personable.\n\nAlthough I do have to say that the 2 gals I dealt with at the front counter were excellent in getting our party of 5 seated in 5 mins instead of the 30 mins we were told to begin with. At a 114 degree weather today we probably could've gone for inside seating, but THAT probably would have been the 30 min wait. The fan misters were OK if you were directly in its path. \n\nOur drinks came out fairly quick, along with the baby's kid meal which were the 2 burger sliders that could have easily been devoured in one bite by any starved adult--they were so microscopic! I guess perfect for a child of 21 months.\n\nThai Salad was pretty good, the Nachos appetizer @ $14 was shabby, only thing good about it was the condiments it came with:  sour cream, real guacamole & fresh salsa. The Buffalo Wings were nothing special, just your ordinary batch that came with sticks of carrots & celery & ranch dressing.\n\nWhat wowed me was the White Cholocate Frozen Hot Chocolate. I think we got gipped because we ordered a Large to share, but it looked exactly like a Regular single serving of the Oreo Frozen that someone in my party ordered. Banana Split, I was told, was good, along with the Caramel Sundae that someone else got.\n\nAll in all, this is not a place to go if youre Starvin Marvin for food, but I wasn't let down w\/my dessert choice since I am a true White Choco lover. They need to re-train staff, but I gave the girl a full tip only because I want to believe she was just tired from the heat & was just probably not having a great day. Whatever. Overpriced. 3 stars because I enjoyed my company.
