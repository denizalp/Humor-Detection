I went to this show a few years ago on a girls 4th of July Vegas getaway... and we all had a blast at this show! This show IS definitely a \"hands-on\" show!! We joked around and said \"no touching\" to each other, but trust me, we touched everything! HAHA. It's true, the guys probably make lots of tips dancing here... but it's the most interactive! The showroom here is TINY and wherever you sit every guy will eventually go down the aisles, so if there's someone you really like, save your dollar bills for him! There was one guy that was like obsessed with my breasts! LOL. He seriously had to play with it every time he came by and even put his face in it! Good times! HAHA. After a few drinks, it's all good. I got pulled up to be on stage too! HAHA. This show is cheaper than the other male dance shows, and most interactive of them all. A more \"upscale\" male dance show would be Chippendales - where there is no touching; however, the last time I went, they went down the aisles, danced with you and one even slapped my butt- hard!\n\nAfter the show, you can stay and meet them, take pics, have some shots on the house. They seemed okay for the most part... but one did try to pick up on my friend. During the show, we meet 2 conservative women who had no idea what this show was... and oh boy, by the looks on their face were they in for a shocker! It was hilarious watching them!\n\nAnyways, I do not think this show is playing any longer even though it doesn't say closed on here. I don't see it advertised anymore on the Hooters Hotel or anywhere in Vegas...
