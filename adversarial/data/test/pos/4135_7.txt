No issues with this location.\n\nBeen there several times and never a wait. Today on a Saturday at 11:30am there were zero customers inside. \n\nI always have a pre-paid label so they scan me and print me a receipt. \n\nNothing else to say but my fav location is still the Downtown one ;) but they are not open on Saturdays :(
