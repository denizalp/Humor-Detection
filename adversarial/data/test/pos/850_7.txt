This is the first time I've ever written a restaurant review. It's not anything I've felt compelled to do before, but after the experience I had at the Chicago Brewing Company I feel like it's my civic duty to warn others. We are new to the area, and after perusing menus online we chose the Chicago Brewing Company for our first outing because the menu we saw said they had wild game sliders. After we were seated we discovered they were no longer on the menu. We should have left then, but we'd already ordered a beer so we decided to stay. Instead I ordered the steak sandwich. My husband ordered the filet mignon sliders, and we got a couple of kids meals for our children. My husband and children's meals were bland, forgettable, and overpriced. How I wish I had anything that good to report about my steak sandwich. \n\nI love steak sandwiches. Anytime I see one on a menu I order it. This was the worst steak sandwich I've ever had. I had no idea they could even be bad until I had that one. I ordered my steak medium, and when it arrived it was so rare it was purple. I like rare steak, so I didn't send it back. The steak was much smaller than the roll it was served on, it had a pile approximately three inches thick of the white, flavorless part of a head of iceberg lettuce, and it was drowned in so much garlic aioli that it basically tasted like a garlic sandwich. You could barely taste the steak, which was too bad because maybe if we could have we would have realized it was rotten. The steak was covered with so much melted cheese that it appeared as though the Blob were attempting to digest it. At least the Blob could have digested it. My husband and I could not. My sandwich was so terrible that I gave it to my husband, who ate the steak only in an attempt to at least get our $14 worth out of the meal. We aren't generally complainers, and our waitress was nice, so we said nothing, tipped our waitress, left, and walked around the Village Square shopping center. I stayed longer, but my husband went home, where he proceeded to get violently ill. I hadn't eaten nearly as much of the sandwich as he had, so it took a little longer for my food poisoning to kick in. \n\nLater that night I called the restaurant to tell them so they wouldn't serve the steak to anyone else. The kitchen manager told me it takes six hours for food poisoning to kick in, which is a lie. He said the general manager would call back the next day. That was also a lie. I decided to look the Chicago Brewing Company up on Yelp, and that was when I noticed four other people complaining about being sickened by this restaurant. That makes me number five, and that's just five who bothered reporting it to Yelp. God knows how many people have actually gotten sick from this place. It's clear they must be keeping their food around long after it should have been tossed out. It's a tiny restaurant and it seems to mostly just be a place to eat while you are gambling, so their food turnover is probably not that high on certain items--one of which I'm going to assume is the steak. \n\nIt's not a coincidence that people are getting sick there. Save your money and go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Ordering the Doritos Tacos Locos at the Taco Bell next door is less likely to sicken you and ruin the rest of your weekend, and that's saying a lot.
