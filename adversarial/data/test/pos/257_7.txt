Second time here and finally writing a review.\n\nThe first time I was pregnant and I think that was effecting my taste buds and overAll opinion of this place. Two years ago I would have given it a one star. The smell of the place made me want to vomit and the food tasted horrendous. I think it was the smell of the grease that had the affect of me.\n\nNow, though my uterus is unoccupied and feeling happy. So we came here a few days ago to give it another go. This time I could actually walk in and breathe. Yay!\n\nThere was extremely busy and that's muy bueno! \n\nNot such a fan of their limited menu. Got the chicken sandwich which was very good and loaded with chicken. The fries come in a large Amount, more than I expected. And I'd love to know what their secret sauce is made of. Not because I like it, because I didn't but because my husband is obsessed with it.\n\nSweet tea is delicious and fresh, their lemonade is awesome. Freshly squeezed throughout the day and perfectly sweet and sour.\n\nThe customer service was fantastic. A manager came over to ask how we were doing and answered my husbands questions. 1. If they were going to build one closer to redrock.. The answer was no. And 2. If they were going to bring it to the strip or east coast.. The answer was also no. Boooooooo ;( \n\nAnyway, another worker came over to ask how everything was, if we needed anything and took our empty plates.\n\nFor a chicken, fry place that's basically fast food I was surprised by the level of service,
