Since last review I've tried even more greatness:\n\nThey had a jalape√±o-watermelon popsicles! WTF OMG good.\n\nAnd recently have started ... wait for it... BEEF TONGUE croissants. WTF OMFG. It took some real plums to try it- but I did...and it was good....tasted like smoked-meat...thinly sliced and with a spicy onion jam. \n\nBeef tongue croissants AND vegan chocolate cupcakes? good lord.\n\nfive pats\npatpatpatpatpat\n\nttyn,\n-PAT.
