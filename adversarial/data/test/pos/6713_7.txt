If you have little ones and would like to take them to see some sea animals but can't make the trip down to Sea Word, the Shark Reef is a great substitute. They do offer Las Vegas residents discounts so make sure to utilize it. Although this aquarium is a bit small especially for the price, its still a great spot to bring the kiddos or to walk around or sit for a few hours. They have seating areas near the tanks that allow you to relax and enjoy nature's creatures up close. They have many other aquatic creatures, not just sharks or fishes. They have lizards, snakes and an alligator. They have a petting sting ray area which is always fun for the little ones. So if you need an activity to do with your kids or would like some time away from the strip life, head on over to the aquarium and be a mermaid for a couple of hours.
