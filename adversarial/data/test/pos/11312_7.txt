Having stayed at both the Wynn and Encore, Bellagio is ranked below both of these fine 5 Star hotels but I blame the MGM Corporation for reinventing Bellagio from an upscale hotel to just another hip resort. They will never have the vision the same way Steve Wynn did when he built and designed the Bellagio but it will always be famous on the Las Vegas strip.\n\nMy Mom received a deluxe comp room for 3 nights and so we couldn't pass it up and booked right away as a mother and son trip. \n\nWhat I like about the Bellagio:\n\n+Updated rooms\n+Center Strip location being close to (Cosmopolitan, Caesars Palace, City Center,                      Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, Ballys, Paris and Mirage)\n+Crowded casino with lots of action\n+Bellagio Fountains\n+The Conservatory (Open 24\/7)\n+Connected to Aria and Monte Carlo\n+The Buffet\n+Excellent Customer Service from all the staff from the valet, bellman, housekeeping, front desk, pool staff and the drink waitresses (Hit or Miss).\n+Free and fast wifi included with the comp room\n+Architecture, Landscaping and Italian marble flooring all over the property. \n\nWhat I dislike about the Bellagio:\n\n-Hookers all over the casino and lobby but that's in all over the strip hotels\n-High priced 24\/7 cafe\n-The long walk from your hotel room to the strip (15 minutes)\n\n\n\nWould I stay here again? Yes I definitely would stay here again!
