Call me a suburban soccer mom, but sometimes it's just nice to have a convenient place to do a bunch of shopping all in one spot.\n\nYou don't have to worry about parking or about spending an exorbitant amount of money. This isn't Legacy Village, and for that I am glad. (Even though Legacy has its place--however small--in my heart.)\n\nThe only time I feel like a shell of myself is when I realize that I'm running out of time doing errands on a Sunday, and then it's either drive to a completely different area for groceries, or go to Wal-Mart. That's a tough decision. When Wal-Mart wins, that's the only time I feel as though Steelyard Commons is a bit evil. Otherwise, I'm all for it.
