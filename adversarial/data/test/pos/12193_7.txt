The burgers and fries here are not too shabby. On my last visit here I ordered 3 meals, all the same, double cheesseburger w\/fries & drink. There were tons of employees working when i was there, like too many. There were 4 people at the counter ( it was not busy,about 2pm on a Monday ) and there were sooooo many people in the kitchen area that I could not count ( maybe like 10 ) and then there were tons in the dining area ( some were eating and others were cleaning ). Anyway, when we got our food all of the burgers were made very sloppy, and one of the burgers was missing the other burger patty. When I went to the front it took forever to be acknowledged by someone, they were all running around like they were lost. I made eye contact with the manager several times while waiting and she said nada. Finally got it taken care of...when the girl brought the new burger it was not a new one, they just added the patty to the burger with 2 bites taken out of it and the girl said \"if anything else is wrong let us know\" in a not very friendly tone.\n\nNote: This place did open not too long ago and this may be the reason for so many employees being there, like maybe there was some training going on. However, after observing the manager while eating I noticed that she did not have a grip on handling the chaos and it made for an unpleasant dining experience. I may try going back in a few months to see if things have improved.
