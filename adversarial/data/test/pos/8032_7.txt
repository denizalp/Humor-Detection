Sweet merciful ribs! I have been trying to visit Holy Smokez for literally my entire tenure at Yelp. I'll be writing the Local Yelp newsletter and it'll pop up as a relevant business to a certain theme and then it somehow gets pushed to the back, before popping up again in another search, review of the day or homepage feed. I FINALLY paid them a visit recently and I was so happy I made it!\n\nAs many others have explained, HSBS is in a kinda run-down strip plaza along Dundas in Mississauga. You might even look past it while driving as the plaza is filled with Asian restaurants and a Vietnamese bakery, and their storefront is so small it's easy to miss(issauga)... yuck yuck yuck lmfao. \n\nIf you're smart you'll plan a visit in advance, load up your GPS, put on your stretchy pants, and bring CASH (you save 10% if you pay cash - but they do accept CC and Debit). Parking is dicey as it's literally a strip along Dundas so if it's packed park elsewhere and hoof it back - trust me you'll be glad for the extra 5 minutes of walking cardio.\n\nThey're known officially as a BBQ sandwich joint, they smoke their own pork, chicken, beef and most of those are shredded and sauced before being topped and slathered between buns to make up any number of their famous sandwiches. \n\nHaving read so much about these sandwiches, I honestly walked in with my mind made up that I was having a sammie - NQA! (No Questions Asked). But then....... the owner just HAD to tell me that they had won an award for the best ribs in the GTA, AND that they smoke their ribs for 24-48 hours (while the standard for most smokehouses is around 3-6 hours) AND that they sell about 100-150 racks a day (or was it a week?) ANDDDDD that he had a freshly cooked batch ready just now....\n\n.... I came to about 20 minutes later, 6 perfectly cleaned bones on my plate, sauce... EVERYWHERE, panting and moaning (from the fullness) and filled with shame\/ribs\/the glee of a small child. These ribs were legit! You can only tease a man so long with the prospect of succulent ribs before he blacks out and goes Hulk on a half rack.\n\nNo regrets. you won't have any either. I'll be back for that sandwich...\n\nEatcrest out
