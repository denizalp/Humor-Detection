Rossini is definitely a hidden gem!\n\nI have come here a couples time the past week and have loved it each time!\n\nThe food and kitchen staff are amazing! The kitchen staff hasn't changed in 20 years! When you order take-out you enter the kitchen to pick up your food so you can see how clean the kitchen is and how professional looking the kitchen staff look. They are also very friendly too!\n\nThe veal parmigiana is excellent, although it doesn't come with very much sauce, so it is dry and even when you ask for extra extra extra extra sauce you still only get just a touch more. \n\nif you are in the area and looking for a great Italian restaurant I would definitely come here and check Rossini out for yourself. You should not be disappointed!
