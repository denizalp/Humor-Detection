Dear America, Get a clue!\n\nHow can we NOT have a bun bakery? How evil is such a thing...coming out of the gym at Concordia, smelling the buns, going into Coco and then presented with the daunting task of....what to get?\n\nEach bun is anywhere from like $1-2, huge, cool or warm and delicious. I myself am a fan of the hot buns stuffed with curry, hot dog, chicken, omg you name it! Also, if you get 6 buns or more there is no tax, so just DO it. \n\nThe concept is cute too. You walk in, grab a tray and tongs, fill er up and then bring it to check out...CASH ONLY!
