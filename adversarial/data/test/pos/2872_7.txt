Talking Stick Resort's Coffee Garden offers up Peet's Coffee brand coffees and frozen and blended drinks, as well as pastries baked at the resort's very own kitchens.  I ordered a medium iced latte ($3.70 plus tax), which came unsweetened (you may add sugar or choose from two Peet's Coffee syrups- Caramel or White Chocolate Mocha) and a brown sugar and cinnamon scone ($3.75 plus tax).  Both were delicious!  The scone, perfectly sweet and moist, was served on a disposable, yet elegant plastic  black square dessert plate, and the coffee came in a prettily-designed plastic glass that perpetuated the blue theme of the gaming floor!  (It even came with a blue straw!)  Since the coffee shop had opened only a few hours before, it still didn't have any to-go boxes to house the large scone, but a Peet's rep found a plastic bag that the dessert plate came in, so he asked if that was OK.  I was about to put the scone into the bag when he said I could take the plate with me, as well.  I not only was able to try a gratifying iced coffee and a delightful scone, but I now have a reusable souvenir!  ;)
