Quality off the Strip wine bar at off the Strip prices.  WIN!\n\nStraight to the libations.  There is a short list of outstanding, highly rated, old world and cult wines offered by the bottle at dirt cheap prices (ie the impossible to get '09 Mollydooker Velvet Glove $225.  It's so hard to get that a wine shop in Hawaii only let me touch and caress the bottle but not buy)  There is also a good selection of wines by the glass offered both in full and half pours to help with tasting.\n\nUnfortunately whiskey, scotch and bourbon drinkers are left out.  For a place named Wine and WHISKEY, you expect more than just the most common names behind the bar\n\nThe simple food is wine centric.  It all pairs well.  Props to the \"Grown-ups grilled cheese\" with its gooey, melted gruyere and smoked ham core; olive poppers (goat cheese and chorizo studded olives); and the rich mushroom arancini with a white truffle scented aioli.  The cheese and charcuterie selection is very good (thanks to a misunderstanding, I tried them all.  No one thought it was funny to serve a dish for 5-7 to ONE me huh?)\n\nThey do offer salads, sandwiches and pastas for those wanting something heavier.  Don't be surprised to find the same items at their other location, Bottles and Burgers.\n\nGreat happy hour from 3:30-7:30\n\nRecommended
