We brought our Lexus in here for its first oil change and had an incredible experience! We really went back and forth on whether or not we should take it in to the dealership for an oil change but after chatting with Whitey's, reading their incredible Yelp reviews, and learning of their love for Toyota cars, we felt comfortable bringing it here. \n\nI made an appointment and they began as soon as I arrived + had it done in under 45 minutes. Yes, please! Their waiting room also has WiFi! The service was so friendly and you can tell that they know what they're doing. There were customers in the waiting room who had been bringing their cars here for YEARS! That is always a good sign! It was such a refreshing start to my Friday morning. \n\nThe best part, I always dread when they come back to you with \"more things\" that need to be taken care of but our car had a clean report! Yay!! We'll be back this Fall!
