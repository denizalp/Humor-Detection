You'll find this eatery inside the Baiz Fresh Foods Market.  They have a variety of your favorite middle eastern eats.  I enjoyed the chicken schwarma.  The prices are great and the portions are huge.  Lots of people come for take out and the sandwiches looked quite hearty as well.  This is a very casual place.
