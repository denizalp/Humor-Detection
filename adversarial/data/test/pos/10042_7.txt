Danno at Lorenzo's made our dinner such a lovely experience. Great customer service. Good pizza, awesome wings, fresh Caesar salad. The quality is good. \n\nIt's a dive on 17th ave, with solid food, across from the Living Room and Ming. There are a couple of parking spots, nice and easy. What's interesting is that the manager who cooked and served us has a fine dining background. So it's quality but doesn't look it right from the beginning. We decided to give it a chance. We were glad we did. We got 5-star service, complete with enjoyable stories about Calgary, restaurants, and hungry NHL hockey players who've eaten his food throughout the years. \n\nWe got a window seat and I don't mind waiting for good pizza. The timing was perfect, Dan brought out two separate plates of delicious Caesar salad to start, we asked for light on the dressing and it was great. Without asking he divided it in the kitchen on two separate plates. Perfect service. He brought some dressing on the side if we wanted and we did. Then he suggested the dry Cajun wings when we asked him and they were great. Piping hot, delicious and fresh. \n\nThen came the pizza. We enjoyed it. Even the next day, the pizza was good. The ambiance isn't \"classy\" but the washrooms are clean, the staff is real and so is the food. Long live real food!
