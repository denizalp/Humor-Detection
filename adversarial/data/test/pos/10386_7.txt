Sorry Silvercreek, but I just can't with you. \n\nI've been here probably 20 times over the course of many years. It's never my choice-- Champaign has a handful of restaurants where everyone goes when they're looking for a somewhat upscale experience and Silvercreek falls into this category. And so I find myself here for graduation celebrations, birthdays, meals for when relatives are visiting, and so on. \n\nMost of my experiences here have been for their Sunday buffet brunch. They offer your standard biscuits, gravy, bacon, potatoes, as well as some lunch-ier fare like pasta and prime rib. It is all less than mediocre. Last time I was there for brunch, my dad said, \"We should have gone to Ryan's.\" Ouch. They have a pretty big selection of desserts. It really grinds my gears that even though they have an omelet and waffle station, they can't make eggs to order because they only have a big bowl of premade egg mix on hand. So yeah, no fresh eggs on hand. They have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but... gross. \n\nSide note, try not to get seated by the omelet station. It gets boiling hot. Last time I was here, I actually dunked my cloth napkin in my water and dabbed my face and neck with it. I mentioned the heat to the hostess on the way out-- she asked how the meal was-- and her response was \"Oh, in the greenhouse? Yeah, hot day.\" No, not in the greenhouse. But that reminds me...\n\nMy best friend had her bridal shower at Silvercreek about a year ago, in the greenhouse. In the middle of the meal, one of the chandeliers DROPPED FROM THE CEILING and shattered on the middle of a table. Unreal. The staff did not know how to handle the situation and the only compensation was free dessert. This place is such a mess.
