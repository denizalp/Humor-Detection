24hr Subway w\/ no Drive Thru.\nYou should eat no where else Late at night\n\nWorkers are great (including me haha). Come by, I'll be glad to make your sandwich.\n\nWe have quick sandwich makers. If you come in when it's slow, you'll be on your way in no time.\n**This location does get a steady amount of customers, wait time depends on how fast the customer orders their sandwich ahead of you** (some ppl take FOREVER)\n\nI would not even go to McDonald's that's nearby.
