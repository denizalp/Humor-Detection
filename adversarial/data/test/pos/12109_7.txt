Yan Can Cook is a located in the popular First Markham Place food court.  I'm pretty sure it has no relation to Chef Martin Yan of the famed PBS series \"Yan Can Cook\" but they share the same name.  Btw I've met and dealt with Chef Yan before in the past...super nice guy and down to earth!\n\nThe food here is good, portions large and cheap.  They serve your typical Cantonese rice and noodle dishes but where they shine is the ready to serve dim sum snacks, especially their Fish Siu Mai.  They are the BEST in the GTA!    Huge, tasty and only $3!  You will not get fish siu mai that is better.  Pair that up with their chili garlic oil and you have a match made in heaven!\n\nDefinitely also try some of their other dim sum fare like the soya sauce rice noodles and curry fish balls as the dim sum fare are all $3-$5 each.\n\n\"If Yan Can Cook, So Can You!\" - Copyright protected by the Yan Can Cook Corporation;p
