My visit to Nakato (first time) was on a Friday night.  The place was packed and had a constant stream of people, busy busy.  We had 6:30 reservations for a party of 6 and once everyone arrived we were promptly seated.  They will not seat you until everyone is there.\n\nWe were seated around a hibachi station - each station has seating for 8, so we had two strangers at the end of our station (no big, they were nice).  I was a little concerned at the cost of the meal when I was looking at it online, but the amount of food is well worth the cost.\n\nI ordered the teryaki chicken.  You start with an onion broth while the chef is warming up.  Next is the small chilled garden salad served with a pink creamy dressing.  While you are finishing your soup and working on your salad, the chef starts with hibachi veggies (thin sliced carrots, onions, zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli).  Next are hibachi noodles (spaghetti with an oil and garlic ? coating).  Next, if you order fried rice with your meal ($1.75 extra) instead of white rice, the chef does the fried rice and portions it out.  Then the meat is started.  Our table had a variety of steak and shrimp items, which were served first since they cook more quickly than chicken (no one wants rare chicken).  I thought everything was quite good (though my white rice was cold, but that is what I get for not ordering fried rice like everyone else at the table).  All of the preparation is done in front of you by the chef, who puts on a show while cooking.  Very interesting, though I was concerned that I was going to lose my eyebrows when the onion volcano was done.\n\nWith 6 people, it was hard to hold a conversation, though not impossible.  If you are catching up with friends, I would suggest getting there early for drinks, or planning drinks and dessert after - once the chef's show starts going, along with all of the tables around you, it is rather noisy.  \n\nOur server kept drinks filled.  The chef was quite personable.  I had water to drink, so my dinner before tip was just under $15.  Contrary to what my dinner date told me, you don't necessarily have to take off your shoes, though they do have traditional tables there as an option.  \n\nBe warned that your hair and clothes will reek of the hibachi smell, so I wouldn't take a post-meal walk through the woods unless you like bears and wildcats.
