Waste of time = money! \n\nThis place is a scam! I came in for a mani pedi and soon realized I didn't have time for both. Decided to get a shellac mani and had only an hour to do so. I had my engagement party later that evening and my make up artist was going to be at my place soon. They assured me that would be no problem. Lisa was good but took way too long even after communicating my timeline. She did not clean my cuticles properly and the next day my shellac chipped! I'm peaved because I paid $60 for this (including $5 \"express\" charge - wtf????) I was out in an hour and 20 min. Ridiculous. This place is trying to be a yorkville salon in a china town shoe box. If I received a quality treatment it would make sense.
