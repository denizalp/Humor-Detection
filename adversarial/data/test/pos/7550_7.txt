Love the atmosphere!  From the art on the walls, furnishings, tables, and chairs, to the menu boards, coffee memorabilia, and nooks and hidden room (or two?), I found this coffeeshop very inviting!  What I didn't appreciate were the tiny flies hanging out in the pastry section of the front corner.  I was particularly hungry and was looking for something sweet to pair with the latte I'd ordered along with the Apple Pie Cortado.  Aaron, the barista who took care of my two drink orders today, apologized profusely about the fly situation.  He tried to get the two pastry covers that were stacked together to pry apart, but it was no use...  \n\nAussie pies were also not available today. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maverick-coffee-scottsdale?select=xR6G0zL6iC6OORD3LX-mqw  I heard someone's order of a panini being ready for pickup, so there's that to look into on my next visit.  Probably not something I could order, but it's nice to know that there are many food options available for those who do not have food allergies and insensitivities to contend with!  I also spotted bags of granola available for purchase, as well as one ready-made cup of yogurt and cut-up fruit with a quarter-cup side of granola in the cold case (along with bottles of soda and juices).  \n\nFortunately, the beverages I ordered were interesting enough by themselves.  Was the easy-on-the-eyes Apple Pie Cortado delicious? http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maverick-coffee-scottsdale?select=psfF5UqQnxyT78Y4yFI4Hg  With a spice base blend of cinnamon, allspice, and brown sugar, a Presta Fiesta single-origin espresso (2 oz.), steamed whole milk (3 oz.), and a maple candy crumble and a wedge of honey crisp apple wedge as garnishes, why, yes, but would I order it again?  Maybe, but not until I've tried everything else there is to try here.  Maverick may not have swept me off my feet from the very beginning like Chandler's Peixoto did, the atmosphere here alone is worthy of another visit.  Perhaps it was the lackluster coffee art that adorned my 16 oz. latte that turned me off... After seeing how pretty the Apple Pie Cortado came out (I assumed it was Aaron who made it, but perhaps it was Ashley's creation?), I expected a cool design on the latte. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/maverick-coffee-scottsdale?select=rD9qxwv-HkD_nHM2nIDeBA  I'm assuming he did both drinks, since he asked me if they were \"for takeout, or for here?\"  I asked if I could get coffee art for both if I decided to take them to-go, and he yes for the latte, but that he didn't suggest taking the cortado to-go, so I decided to just drink them at the coffeeshop.  \n\nFYI, the milks, or at least the cow's milks, offered here aren't organic, nor even local.  (Another reason why I fell hard for Peixoto!)  Since I spotted Yelp photos with captions including almond milk and honey, I'm assuming Maverick offers these two, although I did not see any honey jars or teddy bear bottles lying around.  I did spot packets of raw turbinado sugar and Stevia In The Raw on the table with all the napkins, straws, and cup lids and jackets.\n\nI'll be back again to try another coffee beverage, or perhaps an iced tea.  And next time, I'll make sure to carve out some reading time to enjoy the atmosphere here!
