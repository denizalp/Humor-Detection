OMG! What a fun night! I had been in a Yelp funk lately and Wednesday night was just what I needed! \n\nAll of the businesses greeted us with open arms. Several of them could not express enough how grateful they were that the Elite's and friends came to check out High Street. \n\nThe passport was fun and definitely made it motivating to hit up all the spots! \n\nMany thanks to Hailey and her team for making this event such a success. Congratulations to all of the award winners! \n\nSee you out there fellow Yelpers!
