I am a houseseats member since October of 2017 and I have yet to go to a show because of how many shows are not even worth it or will waste my time if I go. I used to work on the strip so I know what shows you don't need to go to and all of those shows are on houseseats. I check houseseats twice a day, once at 11AM and another time around 10PM. Either way it goes, I haven't seen a show and a good show at that to come up on the feed. Yes the price is good, especially if you are getting 2 for 1 deals, but it isn't worth it if you haven't even gone to a show and it's been months since you've been checking constantly. I think a new update of shows would be nice to satisfy at least the membership cost.
