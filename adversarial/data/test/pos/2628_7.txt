After a night of drinking and partying we came to the right place for brunch.  This is a ode to excess.  My husband and I decided to order two dishes and split them.  Well one would have been more than enough.  Don't get me wrong, the food was so delicious, but there was so much, I think we could have fed a small family.  We had Andy's sage fried chicken benedict and one brown sugar banana pancake.  The pancake was the size of big frisbee.  It was HUGE!!! Of course I had to have a mimosa, you know, hair of the dog, is that the saying???  We ended up leaving half of our meals, not because they were not delicious, but we were stuffed.  The fried chicken benedict was great, huge portion of fried chicken cooked to perfection.  I had this meal around noon and I didn't eat again until the next day.  Next time I am in Las Vegas, I will stop by here, there are still so many items I want to try.
