This place is the epitome of GREAT customer service. Other restaurants should send their staff here for training, on how to treat customers.  We showed up at 7pm on a Thursday night. We knew there would probably be a wait. As we waited we saw the staff re-arrange tables so we wouldn't have to wait too long, Wow. As we were being seated the host noticed the table a little wobbly and fixed it right there on the spot, before we even got seated, another WOW!!. The food here is always good, we mostly have kisras when we come, however I thought I would venture out and try something new. I had the bleu cheese balsamic burger, which I hail it to be  as probably one of the best burgers I have had. The wife had her usual shrimp kisra, which is always good. Our glasses of water were always full, the staff is very attentive. So the kicker, we pay our bill and are already in our car leaving, when our server flags us down, we forgot our leftover boxes at the table, WOW, WOW!!!! I am infamous for forgetting our boxes at restaurants,  this is the first time a server made an attempt to  make sure I didn't forget them. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a PERFECT experience in dining. Thank you FEZ!
