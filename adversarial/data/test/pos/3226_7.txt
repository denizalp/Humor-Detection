A cosy little coffee shop with a cute name and sign, how can you not stop in when you are in the hood.  Located on King St E this is a small spot that seems to be always busy - so don't be surprised if you can't get a seat.  \n\nYou can get some pastries here - I tried the ginger molasses cookie which was delicious!  I had that and a peppermint tea and the total was only $4!  Low lighting and eclectic vibes - random chairs, tables etc make it feel like you belong.   \n\nThe baristas are really outgoing and nice and make you want to come back.  Too bad this place isn't near where I live or I would be here all the time.  A great indie coffee shop that I feel like I could bring a book and just chill for a bit.
