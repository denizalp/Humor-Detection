earlier this year i read where Lou's was voted LVRJ's best breakfast spot or best for cheap eats, somethin' like that !  Being a breakfast guy, i gotta hit this place.\n\n1st time i go there 11:00 am on a tuesday - closed !?!?!  They had a help wanted sign in the window on the door - is that why they are closed ?\n\ngo back again 3 days later - 10:30 am - closed again ?  maybe they are permanently closed ?\n\ntalk to a couple from my meet up food group - they just ate there - said it was nothin' much ( they are hash house fans ) so i decide, one more try.\n\nOn the way to MT. Charleston on a below 100 degree day, the gf and i hit lou's on the way out.  OPEN !!\n\nI get a standard egg\/potato\/sausage patty\/rye bread.  GF gets oatmeal - yeah, whatever !\n\nthey have a large selection of homemade jams\/jellies - i try the strawberry and the apple.\n\noverall impression - boring \/ dull\/ uninspired.  The jellies, nuthin' special .\nprice for both w\/ coffee - $16.\n\nWho the hell voted for this place ?
