So I roll into Sobeys looking to pick up a roasted whole chicken for the family for dinner tonight.  Looked over the cooked chicken like an owl about to swoop down on its prey.  Choose one that I thought looked juicy and tender.  Pay for it and leave.  My mouth is watering on the car ride home.  It is lunch time so I decide, hey, why don't I make myself a nice chicken sandwich with some tomatos, cucumber, cheese and a healthy portion of guacamole. I'm about to cut myself a piece and what do you know...dry as bleepy bleep desert.  For all those who are and want to admit Chevy Chase and Vacation movie fans, remember in Christmas Vacation when Clark attempts to carve the turkey open at the family Christmas dinner and the turkey completely disenagrates...that is what lay before me.  Hence, I wolfed down my dry sandwich with mouthfuls of water.\n\nNext time I'll stick with Loblaws
