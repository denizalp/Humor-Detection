This is the first time reviewing a hair salon however I thought that someone should least mention this long standing Junction establishment.  \n\nCosimo's has been in The Junction for roughly 40 years (so I have been told).  They developed a following or regulars though great service and reasonable prices.  They also love walk-in customers and the typical wait has been from 1 - 10 minutes.  \n\nI have had my hair cut by both Tony and Dominique.  But cuts were excellent.  Both finished my hair using hot shaving cream and a straight razor...old school and totally amazing.  This is truly a testament to the old way of trimming and shaving.  \n\nThe decor is decent.  The barber chairs recline completely if you request a mustache or goatee trim and they swept numerous times while I was there.  It is clean, well lit and one of the few places that I trust my hair to.  I recommend this hair salon to everybody that lives nearby.
