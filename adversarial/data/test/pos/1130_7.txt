I have to upgrade my review to five stars now.  I've been back here about once a month since my first review and introduced BFS to other friends, my mother, my aunts, and other relatives.  Everyone has loved their experience.  I can just call the same day and get an appointment easily and they know me by name.  I haven't had one bad massage yet, so Best Foot Spa is as good as it gets for me.
