I think Apple looks for these guys to work in their stores.  They go down to Comicon in San Diego, and look for disassociated human beings so they can stand around looking down, pointing and clicking, and playing with their I-Phone apps - that way the pretentious public who never mingle with low life, will feel satisfied like they had a visual experience.\n\nAs usual, instead of going to Best Buy, or ordering off the internet, we drove to the Apple store, stupidly thinking that we could get an adapter for our computer, which they had in stock, but refused to sell it to us.  \n\nWe stood around for a half hour trying to get one of these \"employees\" to make eye contact with us.  We were waved off a few times, and we annoyed one young man to the point that he had to stomp off and sulk.\n\nI think Apple looks for these guys, just like Whole Foods looks for people with tattoos and purple hair!  Right?
