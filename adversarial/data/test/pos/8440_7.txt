This one is homey, homie.\n\nGot a chance to stop by Great Lakes while we were in Cleveland and I have to say the brewpub is pretty unique and quite cozy feeling. There was a bit of a wait when we visited so we decided to check out the pub downstairs and have a beer while we waited and caught part of the Ohio State vs Michigan game. Great ambiance and the space overall is great. The building seems to be carved out from either a previous home unit and we were seated upstairs with a nice view against a window once our table was ready. \n\nFor food we shared the Cleveland hero sandwich and the farm stand salad. Sandwich had Pastrami, Genoa salami, Bavarian ham, Muenster, lettuce, tomato, onions, oil, vinegar, rustic Italian bread from Zoss the Swiss Baker. Sandwich was just alright, but have to say that I enjoyed the farm stand salad a bit more featuring grilled pork tenderloin from Dee Jays Meats, Ohio apples, red onion, Montforte bleu cheese, sliced almonds, & Mediterranean mixed greens from Great Lakes Growers. So many components to it, but went together so well.\n\nAnyways, they also have pretty good beer here if you didn't know. Definitely would try a pint or two. 'Til next time, cheers!\n\n308\/365
