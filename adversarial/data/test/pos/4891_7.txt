I just read the Planet Fitness reply to my update and had a good laugh. Therapy animal?? Ok. This same individual was also spotted at my workplace on the strip where he was placing the bird on peoples shoulders to take pictures and then feeding the thing French fries. \n\n\nI assumed Planet Fitness would try to cover their bases in some way. lol \n\n\nDon't know what kind of \"therapy\" that entails, but it sure looks like a lonely dude with a pet bird to me. lol
