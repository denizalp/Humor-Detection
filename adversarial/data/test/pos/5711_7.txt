I  have tell you I am just Enchanted every time I go back!\n\nThank You Glynis you are such a Gracious Host!\n\n**UPDATED**\n\nI went back for lunch today and all I can say is WOW and WOW!!!\nSo Wonderfully Delicious!! I'm home now and want to go back and eat again!\n\nThis is now my New Favorite place, I want to try everything they have!\nHave a look at my pics from lunch :) \nI Got the special=Turkey chowder in a bread bowl, mixed salad and dessert for $10. And Trust that it tasted even better than it looks, I wish it would have never ended!\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs I was strolling along in downtown chandler enjoying the weather I had stopped at each restaurant to look at the menus they had posted outside hoping to scope out my next lunch spot.\n\nI stopped to read the menu here and a friendly girl approached and asked if I would like to be seated, unfortunately I had already ate but went instead to grab and iced tea anyway.\n\nI was greeted with a friendly face from behind the bar who offered to whip me up some suga! Sounds good to me.\n\nAs she whipped, I browsed the wall of tea ,two of the most helpful girls were telling me all I need to know about loose leaf tea and so on.\n\nSuga's ready, Jasmine citrus tea with pureed strawberries shaken up with club soda on the rocks and on the house!....I'm in Tea Heaven! \n\nThen I'm offered a sample of tea leaves in bag to take home and make myself.\n\nI'm gonna have lunch there tomorrow!\n\n5 Stars for Amazing customer service and Hospitality and the Most Delicious Food Ever! And I do Believe the Sweetest Owner\/Manager I've ever met!
