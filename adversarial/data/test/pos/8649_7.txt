My lady and I were feeling some Chinese, so we thought we'd give Golden Star at Heart Lake Town Center a whirl.\n\nThe inside is your typical take out place: A few tables, and waiting customers.\nThe menu is also pretty typical, nothing really stood out as a specialty item.\n\nThe ordering process was infuriating, which almost earned the place a 2-star review. One woman remarked about her 40-minute wait just as we had arrived, when all she had ordered was 1 container of fried rice. Gad-zooks!\nWe stood at the counter for about 10 minutes, while the young girl kept taking call-in orders the whole time, never apologizing for us standing there, or even saying \"hey, I'll just be one more second\". We ended up walking out, and phoning in our order for delivery from the parking lot. \nOnce connected, I was put on hold for a few minutes, and when she came back, she hung up on me by accident. I call back, and she apologizes. \nWhat followed is what happens when a hungry man goes up against an obviously overwhelmed girl on a Friday night. I had to give my address 3 times, spell it twice, give the major intersection I live at, then say my order 3 times. I'm pretty sure I would've been less frustrated juggling chainsaws than dealing with that call, as she never quite seemed fully 'with it'. Anyway, the order was placed, and we could at least wait for the order at my house instead of in the restaurant.\n\nThe order came within 45 minutes, and it was all accurate.\n\nThe only saving grace was the food itself. Not bad at all.\n\nI would eat from them again, but next time I'll be smart enough to have it delivered, and order well in advance.
