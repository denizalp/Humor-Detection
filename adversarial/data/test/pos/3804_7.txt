I have yet to have a single positive experience in dealing with this horrible management company!  I lived in my previous residence (under Rossmar Graham's \"care\") for 5 years.  In that time, I spoke with them on a few occasions-- an incessant barking dog issue, setting up EFT payments, obtaining permission for upgrades to my home, etc.  Each and every encounter was more than just simply a bad experience!  It is virtually impossible to speak with anyone who can actually help you.  You can call or email until you're exhausted and still no one EVER calls you back!  And when you do call, you are given the runaround on the phone just trying to even reach the appropriate department.  In the 5 years, my neighborhood went through at least 3 changes of Property Managers assigned to us, and each one was worse than the last-- no exaggeration! \n\nWhen I moved into my new home (thankfully in a neighborhood with no HOA-- Yahoo!!!!), I rented out my old home.  Last month, I contacted Rossmar and Graham to switch my EFT to a different account in conjunction with the rental.  They informed me that they had canceled their EFT program, and I would have to contact a new (outside) company that would be handling all EFTs for them beginning in April.  Before ending the call, I verified (more than once) that no April payment would be deducted from my old account and was assured it would not- Ha! \n\nI then contacted the new \"PayLease\" company, gave them the new bank info, learned there is now a monthly charge to use the EFT function (great!!) and verified that we were all set for April on the new account only- Ha!  PayLease took out the monthly fee (plus their processing fees) from the new account last week, and Rossmar and Graham took out the monthly fee from the old account last night.  Lovely.  Par for the course for them really! \n\nI have tried to reach someone at their office three times this morning.  Each time, I have waited on hold for so long their system sent me to voice mail.  I'm tired of calling.  I've decided to wait.  I'm going to be up in the area of their offices this afternoon, and I think I'll just pay them a personal visit and refuse to leave until they write me a refund check... wish me luck!
