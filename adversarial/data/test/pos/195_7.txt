Meh. We were there on a slow day. The waitress took forever to take our drink orders. She corrected me when I pronounced bruschetta with a k sound .  (I am certain my Italian speaking friends know better.) \n\nFood was decent. Not stellar. Pricey. \n\nBeer selection was OK.\n\nWe asked for boxes to go, and she brought one box for two orders. We had to request a second box, as my daughter lives at her own house, and wanted her own food to go.\n\nWe were not in a hurry and the place was a ghost town. She brought us our check before inquiring if we wanted anything else. Yes, I wanted a second beer. She acted offended that we needed our prematurely delivered check updated. Oh, and when she brought the second beer...It was incorrect. She wanted to correct me on my order as well. Ugh.\n\nThis restaurant is right up the street, and I doubt I'll try it again. There are plenty of good restaurants around.
