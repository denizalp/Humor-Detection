I think of this cemetery as a park. And as parks go, it is really nice. It has lots of paths, trees and flowers, which draw joggers all day. It less than a 10 minute walk from the center of Uptown, which is close enough to be convenient but far enough that you can see a spectacular skyline.\n\nAnd most of the residents are very very quiet. They hardly ever crawl from the ground as reanimated specters of their former selves and pursue you with the familiar zombie rallying cry of BRAIIIIIIIIIINS. Still, I wouldn't hang out here after dark. The neighborhood is so-so even without the living dead.
