Grade: A+\n\nMy husband and his groomsmen claim this is the best steakhouse they have ever tried, so I will take their word for it for now until our next visit to Vegas. It was highly recommended by their hotel staff at the Venetian.\n\nHusband ordered the bone-in-ribeye steak with truffle butter and says it was to die-for. \n\nWill be back with my review, but as far as steaks, I know my hubs can do no wrong!
