Super tasty fun!\nThe place is massive, and delightfully tacky.\nSports sensory overload with all of the TV's...whenever the NHL gets their act back together, i'll be watching some games from here!\n\nThe AYCE night is a great option when you have 5-6 people. You can only order 1 flavour, but are allowed to share.\n\nWhen I am there on my own, or with one other person, i usually get their sample platter, which gets 4 flavours, 20 wings for $20someodd\n\nBut I am in LOVE with teh Dr Pepper flavour! I thought it would be weird, but its actually really good!\n\nFor you Yelpers, there will be more UYE events here in 2013! Woooooo!
