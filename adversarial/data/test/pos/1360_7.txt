This church has great intentions, believe me. They want to reach out and share the gospel with lost souls which is awesome but they preach hate instead of love. Honestly, they don't even practice what is preached there. The Teis family is controlling and judgmental in so many ways. They don't have a church budget so no one knows where the money goes and I'm not sure how much currently but I know they're in debt several million dollars if not more. They guilt-trip the congregation into giving them money. Many of the teachings, I believe, are using brainwashing tactics. \nGrowing up there was great because I was a young, naive girl who didn't know any better. Once I got to the high school group is when I saw true colors. People talking trash about other people, Pastor Matt (high school leader) dissing other religions and making fun of them, and people judging me just because I went to public school.\nTheir biggest problem is that they focus too much on rules and regulations rather than the love and mercy Jesus offers.\nSave yourself the hurt from being stabbed in the back and guilt if you don't go to church three times a week and if you aren't dressed from your neck to your knee and run as far away as you can from this place. They focus on appearance and only what you appear to be (fake) so if you have tattoos or earrings (guys) then you best be leaving. They'll look down on you if you don't fit into their 'cookie cutter christian'. But it's not about what you look like, it's about whats in your heart. \nAlso, they use ONLY King James Version of the bible which is very hard to understand. They often twist around and manipulate scripture by only using one version, making is less accurate. \nJesus died for us not so we can judge others, but so we can love and encourage them.\n\n Romans 8:1 ESV\nThere is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew+23
