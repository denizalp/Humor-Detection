I go to this theater all of the time because it's so convenient to get to for me. But tonight I had a horrible experience. So it all started Thursday night, I go in to prepurchase tickets for June 9 at 7:15 for the movie Meghan leavey. I purchased 5 tickets. Over $50. The guy didn't know how to work the computer. But he finally prints out my tickets and goes \"okay! You're all set for tomorrow at 7:15\" I'm like great thank you. And I leave. \n\nFast forward to today. My four friends and I are super excited for our girls night and we get all our concessions (which is about $60) and go to our theater. We get in no problem. As we're sitting there, this super rude couple comes up and yells that we're in \"their\" seats. So I pull out my tickets and clearly see the correct row and numbers. They go and complain and a staff member asks to see our tickets. He looked for a long time and realized that our tickets were in fact not for tonight but for Saturday! Well we all work and Friday was our only opportunity! So I calmly say to him, that that is incorrect and explain to him the situation. He says to me, \"well these tickets are still for tomorrow and you'll have to come back then.\" No. That's not happening. I prepurchased these and I can't come back tomorrow. We'll move seats but this is our only time and this was your company's mistake. They finally let us move seats. (The family that took our seats were obnoxious through the whole movie and it took forever for staff to address this) \n\nMeghan leavey was a great movie. But then we had another problem. One of the gals with me threw away her popcorn bucket forgetting she had a refill. I reminded her and we decided we'd just ask for a new bucket. We took the old bucket up with us and asked. The guy says it's $8.50 for a new bucket! Are you kidding me?? It's a 25Â¢ bucket! I told him no. Explained what happened and he begrudgingly got us our refill. Then he wanted to charge us for new lids! Ridiculous! Probably won't be going back here. The staff is awful. And not well trained. Companies have no loyalty to customers anymore. Shame on you galaxy\/cannery.
