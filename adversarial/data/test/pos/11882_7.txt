A to the power of two for real\nBrought me to here for a deal\nLovely service taverna set\nIn or out left not one regret\nFound tacos of white corn\nFish, beef,or pork torn\n\nWhat salsa heats my heart inside\n\"More chips!\" My hungry heart cried\nI can't believe I've been deprived hence\nAnd the ambiance made crazy sense\nIf my restrictions did not limit my hunga'\nI would've downed a chimmichanga'\n\nI could see plates full of yumminess piled high\nHow could i show up here on a diet, why?\nA bit pricier than the average taqueria spot\nThere's so much love mixed in this hot pot\nI need to say that a fifth star is not illusive\nJust wish it had drinks more inclusive\nI'll return not just because its on Hardy at Mitchell\nBut because it's food speaks my name, Mitchell....\n\nOk... so the rhyme is corny but the experience is not.\nDon't miss this gem tucked away in Tempe...just don't make it hard for me to be seated!
