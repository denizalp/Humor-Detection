Dropped into the gym when I was in town apartment hunting.\n\nThis place comes highly recommended for drop ins, so I figured it might be a great fit for when I move to town. The facility is tucked away in an industrial area and is much bigger than it looks from the outside. I made it to the 7am class which was small for the day, according to Coach Rudy. \n\nI love feeling welcomed, so it was nice to hear the coach instruct the members to introduce themselves to the new faces. We all shook hands and then got through class together. You warm up together, which I LOVE! I mean, have you seen the meme that says, \"When you tell the class to do their own warm up...\" If not, google it. \n\nRudy made sure to explain scaling options for the strength component (5 sets of 10 chin ups unbroken) and paired me up with a trio for the workout. 6 rounds for time. 200m run, 200m farmer carry while your partner holds a high plank). Switch every round. I was one of two drop ins that morning, and everyone in the class was super friendly. It's definitely a top contender for my new gym.
