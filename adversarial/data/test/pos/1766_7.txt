The first 4-5x I ate here, the food and service were really good. The last two times, including my last time ever, the steam pots have been over cooked and the service staff appears to be Perkins castoffs. \n\nOur service was really good tonight, but the food wasn't. The corn looked like it had AIDS and tasted like I think AIDS would taste. The crab was overcooked and I had to scrape it out of the shell to eat it. My wife's hush puppies were really dry and tasteless as well. The fries had roughly 3 pounds of salt, so I could get heart disease to compliment my the aforementioned Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Lastly, some server who apparently forgot she wasn't at home in her mobile mansion kept yelling to her co-workers every time she walked by our table. Nothing says ambiance like white trash and giant sharks. \n\nI'm done with this location and will take my crab needs to the Joes in Station Square.
