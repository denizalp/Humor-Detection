Every school has their local bar or pub that everyone goes to to binge drink after exams, regardless of how good or bad they are...This is Midwestern's! Haha. Even though they are now known as the Australian, we still call it by their original name RTO's. The beer and mixed drinks are cheap (compared to like 15 bucks a drink where I'm from!) and they have nightly drink specials. I can see how people are disappointed by their \"Australian\" menu... truth is the menu did not change much from their original menu except for the addition of a few items. Love their nachos, duck fat fries, sliders, and asian\/orange sauce wings. Don't order the onion rings, you will be disappointed! I will continue going here until 2016... when I graduate and move back to California!
