our waiter was awesome! \n\ni had the steak fajitas and they were totally over priced at $18 but some of the best fajitas ive ever had!!! i didn't eat any of the sides or tortillas because the meat portion was so large and that was my favorite part. \n(that's what she said!) \n\n\nthis is a fox concept i will happily, HAPPILY go to. scrumptious.
