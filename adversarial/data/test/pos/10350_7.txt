I had honestly thought places like this had died off,  the neighbourhood Barber shop had become a dinosaur in my mind, replaced by hair dressers and salons disguised as barber shops.  After being turned down by a \"barber shop\" in disguise because I didn't have an appointment I hit my yelp app and found this place,  boy am I glad I did.  \n\nWalking into this cozy shop on Markham's main street and hearing the buzz of people talking in conjunction with the snip snip of Barber's shears immediately washed away the bad taste of the sterile, nuevo \"barber shop\" I previously mentioned. This place was seriously old school and I LOVED it. \n\nThe owner greeted me cheerily,  figuring out they only took cash I asked him where the nearest bank was his response was \"don't worry,  get it after! Besides I don't want you to lose your spot! We trust you,  just leave your shoes.\"  After a chuckle I knew I had found my new barber. \n\nHaving not cut my hair or shaved my beard in upwards of three months, it goes without saying that I was looking hobo-tastic.  I was seated in one of the three Barber chairs and an elderly Sicilian gentlemen named Sultana went to work with a precision and vigour that would make Edward Scissor hands green with envy.  Soon I was looking clean and respectable, with a perfectly  trimmed beard and short hair.  My cut and beard trim cost me under $30 before tip. \n\nBesides the excellent services, the atmosphere of this place is amazing. It's truly a place for a man to come,  get groomed and relax.  It's a place where you can discuss current events,  sports, or politics without the hassle of your Twitter feed.  It's a testament to them that there was a lineup on a Thursday afternoon.  I was glad to see people bringing their young sons here to pass on the tradition of a true barber just like my father  had done with me.  I for one will be back here frequently. \n\nThis place is simply a gem.
