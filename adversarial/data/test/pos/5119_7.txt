$5.99 for all you can eat lunch. Not bad for all you can eat pizza, but my personal preference for AYCE pizza is by far Round Table. I don't really care if its a little bit more expensive its better quality pizza by far no questions asked.\n\nBUT...\n\nI would literally come here and pay for all you can eat pizza just so I could spend an hour stuffing my face with there cinnamon bun dessert.. Like oh my god these little pastries came from heaven and nothing will ever be better.\n\nThe place has a bunch of ratchet girls working for them who have major attitude, and lack basic customer service skills, but if you can move past their bitchy teen aged personalities you should go have some dessert, like right now.\n\nI'm not kidding.\n\nGo.
