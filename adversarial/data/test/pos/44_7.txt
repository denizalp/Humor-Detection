This review is for the casino only.  \n\nThe PH Casino is always crowded and generally quite noisy.  I've played there before a show or when I went there for dinner but this is not a destination casino for me.\n\nI do find a fair variety of games but I generally stay in one area near the Miracle Mile Shops.
