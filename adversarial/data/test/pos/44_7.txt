This has to be one of the most poorly designed mixed use centers in Charlotte.\n\nThey market it as \"The Town of Ayrsley\" but I've never seen any town designed so poorly.  The place lacks parking for the shops it has and the I can't imagine where the residents, who live above the retail sections, park. They do have a parking deck, a big lot near the movie theatre, and a couple small lots here and there but if you want to go to Wild Wing Cafe, you may have to walk far if the place is busy.\n\nFor restaurants you have Wild Wing, Portofinos, Harry's Grill and an Indian place as your main options.  There is the movie theatre which is decent and there are a few hotels in the complex and Fintastic fish store.  Off to the right side is a bunch of residential from townhouses to apartments. \n\nI've seen many restaurants fail in the sections facing Tryon Street due to the poor access and parking situation.  Lately they blocked off the back entrance to the parking deck due to additional construction so you have to go around to the front. Additionally, there is a pedestrian exit to the parking deck between some handicapped spaces but you can't get out on the other side because there is another handicapped space there.\n\nThe only reason I come here is for Harry's and ocassionally Portofinos. Otherwise i stay away. Unless you live or work here, I'd suggest you do the same until the parking situation improves and I doubt that will happen anytime soon.
