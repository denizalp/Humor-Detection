This was not my first trip To Sam's, but it may be my last. \n\nFirst I was treated to a circus in the parking lot (carts! My God the carts!). Second, just moments after entering I was accosted by the DirecTV guy. (for the 1000th time, I don't want DirecTV!) Then came the barrage of carney-like sample pushers. \"Would you like to smell this roach spray?\" \"Would you like try these horribly disgusting liquid vitamins?\" (Remember when it used to be fun to get free samples?) \n\nThe next assault came at the checkout. \"Do you know about our membership plus?\" Guess what? I don't want it. \"Do you want the extended warranty on the $50 fan you're buying? Membership plus automatically extends the warranty.\" Guess again, I still don't want it! \"Would you like to buy the two year extended warranty for just $20?\" Dear God in heaven, can I please just pay and get the heck out of this store!? \"Would you like to save on future purchases by applying for the Sam's Club MasterCard?\" I'm going to have to start pretending I don't speak English so these people will leave me the hell alone. \n\nDesperate to launch one last salvo against my sanity, before leaving I had to wait in an unreasonably long line so an unpleasant woman could scribble on my receipt with a green marker and wave me along like so much cattle. She literally said, \"keep it moving\" and waived me toward the door with that smug palm-up half wave tour guides use to keep you on the path. I would have complied had it not been for the gauntlet of abandoned carts between me and the door, including one of the motorized variety which had stalled directly in my path. \n\nI have always preferred Sam's Club to Costco (where I also have a membership) because it's less busy and generally less of a hassle. However, if they're going to make it this much work for me to shop there, count me out.
