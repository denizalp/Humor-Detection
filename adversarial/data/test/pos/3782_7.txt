Surprised!  Amazed!  Astonished!  Stunned!  Shocked!\n\nNo, that's not my reaction after seeing my polished piggies... that's my disbelief at not being offered an upsell.\n\nYuko and I came after hiking Picacho Peak, with our feet needing sweet relief.  Mine actually needed a pedicure bad, as the previous pedicure's polish from 4 months prior, now looked like French tips on my downtrodden digits.  Take a couple of seconds and let that visual sink in.\n\nI received a basic $25 spa pedicure, and the massage portion was pretty darned nice.  I probably would have bit on the paraffin upgrade, but that $5 is snuggled safely in my wallet
