After my NYC eating\/drinking Vacation, I now always have urges and desire going to bars\/lounges and having a cocktail or two... Talking about bad\/good influences from my Yelp peers in NYC! :) \n\nSince I am not really into the crowds or going to places that are really hopping, Pravda Vodka Bar is perfect for a night cap on a weeknight! Quiet but still have patrons...and for sure you can get good services or have your requested fulfilled!! \n\nLychee Martini ($11) always my choice of Martini since I love lychee..so it was easy for me to decide. I let my Yelp drinking Buddy to have his vodka tasting instead since I am just a light weight when it comes to alcohol. \n\nAnd he for sure has a delighted experience being served by the friendly, knowledgeable and sexy bartender. Each vodka selections was explained thoroughly and my friend was too busy enjoying the moment and for him every single one tasted the same :). \n\nPravda Vodka Bar for sure is a date place on a weekday. The soft lighting, the atmosphere, the rich and red deco and those velet loungers!! Anyone would have feel romantic and chic having a drink here!\nThen my Yelp Drinking Buddy just woke me up from my dream.......\n\nI need to be back during Happy Hour for their ($6) Martinis!! Now I know where I will wait for my hard working Yelp friends while I have a drink or 2. \n\nPICK ME UP at Pravda!!
