I had portuguese chicken, rice and potatoes from a place on Dupont street the other day and it just sucked.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I live 2 minutes away from this place and have been eating here forever, but this place is the best.  Their chickens are big AND juicy! A leg off one of their chickens actually yields enough meat to feed you, unlike most places in the City.\n\nMmm, I also love the little shrimps in their rice and their potatoes are fried and firm -- perfect for dipping in their hot sauce (which I could drink by the gallon!)  and their fish fillets and fish cakes are also very good.  Those portuguese sure know how to make some fish alright.  They also have a small selection of buns and loaves of bread (sometimes too crusty for my liking)\n\nLine ups are common around Dinner time (be patient) and they close earlyish...I think at 7:30-8? because they're open pretty early.
