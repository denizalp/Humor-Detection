The Infamous Abbey Kitty has long fur that gets dreaded up in the winter months. She will not allow her coat to be brushed for long before biting the handler. My mama has tried to tame this beast to no avail. The theme song of Abbey Kitty is \"Mama Tried\" by Merle Haggard. Her fur is haggard as Merle and finally we found a groomer that will let her unfurl. She is roaming the neighborhood with a new sense of confidence. I will never forget the day I came home from college to visit family and had to cut a turd roped up as poop lock by poor Abbey Kitty's butt. That event brought Abbey and I together and she is the best sister I could ever ask for.
