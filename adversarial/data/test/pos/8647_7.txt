Be prepared to spend money - but you'd know that already if you've seen the photos of the lobster towers! Overall we had a good experience. On a Thursday night we were told we would have to wait half and hour, luckily it ended up being 5. Place is huge, but it was packed at 9pm. The place was well-ventilated, our lobster was yummy and well-seasoned (fried lobster with salt and pepper), and I enjoyed eating it with my hands. Service was great and a little surprising - everyone seemed to want to help us, perhaps because there are cameras everywhere. Dessert (a bowl of black sesame sweet soup) at the end.\n\nWe asked for a 3 pound lobster - they could only find one that was 4.5 pounds. If they were trying to be deceitful, I was okay with the cost anyway. It came to a total of $115, with tax and 10% gratuity included. They only take cash and debit. Are management that cheap that they don't want to deal with the credit fee? You have $3000 bottles of alcohol on your menu, and $3000 set menus for meals. Please. I'm used to Asian cheapness and subpar service (am Chinese, still go to dim sum and HK cafes on the regular), but this was a joke. By nature this place is like kind of high end but kind of not because it runs like a standard Chinese restaurant. We paid $150 in cash and did not receive our change after waiting about 10 minutes then leaving.\n\nSomeone else paid and so I did not know that they had not given us our change until we left the restaurant. Why my companion didn't press the staff about it is another story that is not relevant to this review, but the point is - absolutely unacceptable (yet sometimes common in Chinese-run places) to not give us our change back, let alone $35 which would have amounted to nearly a 40% tip since gratuity of 10% was already included. The service had been great throughout the whole meal and I doubt they would have simply \"forgotten\". Feel free to correct me on my math - the main thing is, we should have gotten our change back.
