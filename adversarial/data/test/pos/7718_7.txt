First time I've ever had to change my rating of a business!\n\nI've now owned this Pilot for less than 21 months and for the 2nd time the battery has gone bad. The first time around I was able to get a jump and come in, but this time it wouldn't take a jump.\n\nI arranged a tow and called Arrowhead to tell them it's on the way and the symptoms. When asked if it was under 36K miles and under warranty, I replied that it better be, since I can switch a battery myself, and I figured they could see that I've already had the 100-month battery replaced. Really, how COULD it not be under warranty?\n\nSo, I was rather surprised to find that I was being charged for the tow and the battery replacement, ALL of it...because my odometer read 36,344. \n\nI can't even explain how ridiculous this is. I can replace a battery in minutes, costing about $80. Why the hell would I have it towed when it should clearly be covered? It's a BATTERY; batteries don't depend on mileage to go bad, they go by time and temperature extremes; two bad batteries in less than 21 months is bad, and there's no reason to charge me $250 for this.\n\nArrowhead, you just lost a customer that was actively referring people to you. Great job!\n\nEDIT\/UPDATE 1\/11\/2017:\n\nIt's been over 3 weeks now since I wrote this review. After I posted this on Yelp, I was contacted the next day by their customer service rep, Jill, who wanted to discuss things with me. She assured me that she had listened to the phone call when I first spoke with the service advisor and felt that Arrowhead had done everything correctly in this situation. I asked her to reconsider in light of the issues and the mileage (which, again, should have zero bearing on a battery)...I even said, since I called the tow service and since that's a 3rd party, I was more than willing to pay for the tow, and even the approximate cost of a battery replacement, which meant that the amount I was asking for in return was really just the mechanic's labor and the price difference in a Honda battery versus an AutoZone battery...we're talking about MAYBE $50, which would have resulted in this review being massively upgraded.\n\nShe called me back once, leaving a message that indicated they had done everything correctly, and she has yet to respond to two telephone messages and two emails telling her she can call me at anytime to discuss things.\n\nI don't think I have a way to accurately describe how pitiful this service has been, which is why I've now downgraded this review from 2-stars to one.
