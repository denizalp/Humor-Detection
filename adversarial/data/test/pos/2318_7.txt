Over hyped and overpriced.\n\nWent on opening day..not much of a wait to order. \n\nI ordered the \"Greatest Hits\" combo and the strawberry-corn milkquake.  Service was fast, but they did make a mistake with our order which resulted in a free sweet potato milkquake.  \n\nThe milkquakes (made only in Las Vegas) are supposed to be similar to a Dairy Queen blizzard. As I tried the strawberry corn milkquake, my first impression likened it to a McFlurry without an adequate spoon for eating. Milk Bar has flat wooden spatulas (larger ones are provided with the milk quake than what is on the counter). The flat spatula shape made it incredibly difficult to actually scoop the bits in the milkquake. The strawberry corn milkquake was a lot thicker consistency wise in comparison to the sweet potato milkquake we also had. Taste was so-so as I would often get a chunk of corn cereal or blob of strawberry jelly\/preserve stuck in my \"bubble tea sized straw).\nPresentation for the milkquake was also lacking. For $10, I expected something more than a clear plastic cup with a domed lid. \n\nGreatest hits combo:  A nice option for those who are new to Milk Bar & want to try a little bit of everything. Presentation was lacking also as it comes in a basic brown paper bag \"partially\" stamped with the milk logo (see attached pics). I've had take out food presented in better packaging than this.\nThe bday truffles were decent, but I feel like they don't match the 3 for $6 price tag (as they are very similar to a starbucks cake pop). Compost cookies were not anything special either. I know they're made up of Chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, coffee, graham cracker crust, pretzels and even potato chips...but in all honesty, the flavors were muddled together and the cookie itself was drier and smaller than expected for a $3 cookie. The crack pie was ridiculously SMALL. Upon opening the clever cardboard packaging, I was shocked to realize that I had paid $6.50 for a slice of pie smaller than my hand. Marketed as a twist on the traditional Chess pie, the Crack pie was disappointing...if served independent from it's wrapper, i would not be able to identify anything unique about it. The cereal milk soft serve is just okay, a gimmicky flavor to try if you like cereal--as it tastes like cap n crunch flavored milk. \n\nAll in all, my opening day experience at Milk Bar was disappointing. Presentation, portions, and taste just don't match the hype or cost.\n\nI believe there are plenty of other better looking and better priced options for sweets in Las Vegas...don't waste your dollars or calories on this one.
