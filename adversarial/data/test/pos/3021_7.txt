Don't you just love cars ...that is, right up until something goes wrong with them. I feel exactly the same way. In fact, the feeling of sheer and utter dread overcomes me when I hear grinding noises coming from the front end of the car, despite my best attempts to keep up with rigorous maintenance schedules, oil changes, etc. Well, that was the case for me yesterday as I started to drive my car around sunny Scottsdale.\n\nThe guys were really friendly and helpful. They found the problem quickly and provided me with a reasonable estimate of the repair costs. I called around a few other places and found their price hard to beat. They completed the job within the hour and called me on my cell phone to confirm my car was ready for pickup. Great service! No hassles!
