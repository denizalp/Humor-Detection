For those of you who don't live in Vegas, this is the company that picks up your trash and recycled items.  In the 17+ years I've lived here, they only get 3 Stars from me.  Here's why:\n\nPROS\n- They pick up trash on holidays.\n\n- They never miss a scheduled pickup day.\n\n- They will pickup trash up to 6 feet long.\n\nCONS\n- They pick up the recycled items later in the day, which can make the neighborhood messy if it's a windy day.\n\n- They always leave the trash can in the street instead of near the sidewalk.  Sometimes, they leave the trashcan at the neighbor's house next door.\n\n- They sometimes leave some trash in the can.\n\nOverall, it's not bad.....bottom line, there's no other option, so I'll have to live with it!  Thanks @Misti Y for the inspiration to review the trash guys!
