Very nice atmosphere.  Great bartender!  Food was overpriced for pasta. We sat on the patio and were surprised by the fact that a dog ran into the restaurant (not a service dog) and then the owner picked it up and was seated on the patio.  The owner of the dog processed to kiss the dog at the table tongue and all.  It was unsettling lucky we had already finished our meals.  Very odd that an upscale Scottsdale restaurant would allow this.  We would probably not go back
