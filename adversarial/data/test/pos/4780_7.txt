Tom's Urban has been on my \"to-eat\" list for a while now. I like to play and stay every so often at the New York New York Hotel & Casino and have walked pass this place way too many times. Just recently I decided let's end the procrastination! I arrived the other night just in time for Happy Hour! Score! On top of that there was no wait and we were seated right away! Our server was Eddie (I think that's his name) for the evening. He was great! There is nothing more that I appreciate than an attentive and honest server. When you are able to provide your own personal favorites on the menu as well as let the dining customers know what's not so good you get plenty cool points with me. Since I've never been there were two items I inquired about one being the full rack of ribs and the other the lobster roll. Both of these were explained to be \"just ok\" for taste. My theory is if I am going to pay extremely crazy prices for food I better be getting something damn delicious and well above \"just ok\". I finally made my mind up to eventually order the BBQ Bacon Jalapeno Burger Double Down Style which means double the meat and cheese! Score! With a side of sweet potato fries? Yeah I was in there like swimwear! Mouth just watered after ordering. To kill the immediate hunger me and my partner in crime decided to order the Hummus dip off the happy hour menu! If you are a hummus lover please do yourself a favor and get this to start! You won't regret it! When the burgers came out they looked amazing! My plate was just everything I thought it would be. The second burger that was ordered was the \"Sin City\" with a side of the garlic fries. Now I had to dock them a star on the fries on that plate because they were ridiculous! Cold! And you could tell they've been sitting. They lost even more points because when we brought it to our server's attention he took the plate of fries and returned within maybe 2 minutes? We are no fools I know that chef or whoever was in the kitchen just put those same fries in the hot grease and returned them to us. You can tell the difference between a fresh batch of fries or what was reheated..  After everything I still wanted desert and opted for their signature cheesecake with some raspberry sauce and whipped cream. To-go though because the burger was huge! All in all this was a pretty good visit and really enjoyed the burgers. I've heard brunch is great so I will be back to see what that's all about soon!
