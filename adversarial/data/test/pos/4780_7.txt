I have tried two or more different Canadian Tire locations, but I always end up coming back to this specific location.\nThey always have some major deals and promotions, and their service department is great.\nI have read some terrible reviews on the 'service dept' part, but I have personally been going there for close to 8 years now, and I never had one bad experience. They're always professional, helpful, and they give me different pricing options and always tried to accommodate me in busy times!
