The salespeople here are as low key and elegant as the products they carry. I've always been more of a Tiff's girl, but when my grad school gift custom Tank Francaise needed routine maintenance...duh I went to the source. \n\nGifted with a diamond bezel Tank Francaise I was, and am always speechless when I look at it. Prior to this, my idea of a fancy timepiece was a Movado Museum watch...I don't really pay attention to such details. Perhaps I should start! \n\nClearly, I was stunned by the fact that Rod L was nearly dead on in quoting me the price, model, etc. Wow, Dad. Anyway, the service is fantastic....the timepieces are classic, and I will probably never wear it again as it cost more than my first dwelling. My Dad has exquisite taste! \n\nOf course there's bling for days here, classic Panther pieces, love bracelets and rolling rings. The outstanding red carpet worthy works of art never cease to dazzle. So whether window shopping, having simple maintenance or choosing the ring that elicits an enthusiastic \"Yes!\" to a proposal: Cartier is a classic choice. \n\nYelp 100 Challenge
