First lunch in downtown Phoenix and we decided to eat at the cafe vs the food trucks\/booths at the Public Market. We were lucky enough to walk in where it wasn't too crazy. There is indoor seating and patio seating. You review the menu prior to placing your order at the counter. You are then given a number and you select your own seats. I opted to order the rotisserie chicken and fries. They have can and bottle drinks in the small fridge and if you check in you get a free cookie.\n\nPay attention to the cookies though. I noticed some flies swarming around and landing on the cookies. Luckily my cookie came from the bottom. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie and yum LOTS of chocolate chips like I like them. Also definitely warm it up!\n\nMy entree was super salty. The chicken had a strange taste like it was covered in bacon, but no bacon in sight. The fries were salty too. The first couple bites were OK but after a while, I had to give my meal to my friend.\n\nWhat I thought was cool was that they offered sparkling and regular water (serve your own). Silverware is located on the table, but if you sit outside, you deal with the flies. It was warm out also, so if you're not used to the heat, you better make your way inside!\n\nService was friendly and dining here was an OK experience for our first meal in Phoenix.
