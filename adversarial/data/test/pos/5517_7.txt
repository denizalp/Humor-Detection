The Low Down\nAhh Spearmint Rhino... I've been dying to check out this topless gentlemen's club after hearing about it several years ago from a former co-worker of mine who won their annual Super Bowl pool.  I arrived at the club at 8:30pm on a crowded Friday night; while I don't normally review clubs on the weekend, I was in town for the Adult Entertainment Expo and wanted to see how much excitement this club had to offer.\n\nBefore we continue, however, I need you to be mindful of two very important rules about Las Vegas gentlemen's clubs:\n\nLas Vegas Gentlemen's Club Rule #1: Las Vegas Gentlemen's Clubs Can Be Overwhelming!\nThe biggest and best gentlemen's clubs in Vegas are MASSIVE!  Take your time and don't let yourself be easily overwhelmed... most clubs are open 24 hours and the larger ones can have hundreds of dancers working at one time.  Take your time, relax and enjoy!\n\nLas Vegas Gentlemen's Club Rule #2: ALWAYS TAKE THE LIMO!\nWhat I'm about to say isn't going to make much sense, but just hear me out.  If you walk into most Las Vegas gentlemen's clubs off the street, expect to pay a cover charge of $30.00 to $50.00.  However, if you're at a hotel (if not, walk to one nearby) and request a complimentary limo ride (even if it's only you and nobody else) and admission to the club is usually FREE!  You'll just need to tip the limo driver as they work for tips (don't be cheap!).  Oh, there's just one catch... it's usually free transportation to the club but not FROM the club.  Check the club websites and plan your transportation accordingly.  Do your homework and you can save a bundle... to spend on the hard-working dancers, of course!\n\nLocation & Facilities - 5 Stars\nAt over 20,000 square feet, Spearmint Rhino is one of Vegas' largest gentlemen's clubs.  The club is located between I-15 and the Strip and is close to Treasure Island, The Palazzio and Wynn Las Vegas.  Although Spearmint Rhino is located in a large facility, the club interior is focused on one main pole with lots of seating around the pole as well as booths around the interior walls.  There are a variety of rooms and booths available throughout other parts of the club designed to accommodate any crowd, party or occasion.  The DJ plays mostly rock and dance music, while the limited flat screens around the two spacious bar areas keep your attention focused on the dancers.  Although not for use by the patrons, Spearmint Rhino has a dancer supply store on premises which offers a wide assortment of lingerie, bras, panties, shoes and much more.\n\nStaff - 5 Stars\nFrom my friendly limousine driver Jimmy to Calvin, the awesome men's room attendant, the customer service at Spearmint Rhino provides an unparalleled level of customer service.  As with many of the Las Vegas gentlemen's clubs, I was escorted in by a door greeter to a seat where I was promptly assisted by a lovely waitress.\n\nFood & Drink - 4 Stars\nSpearmint Rhino offers a wide variety of liquor options as well as your standard import and domestic beer choices, but unfortunately they didn't have any craft beers on hand.  The club provides bar food fare (cheeseburgers, wings, etc.) every day except Tuesdays.  The club offers a variety of bottle service packages ranging from a $225.00 couples package up to the $5,000 Rhino VIP Party #2 which includes two premium bottles and round-trip limousine service to a top nightclub along with Rhino Girls to party with for up to ten people.\n\nDancers - 5 Stars\nBeing at one of Las Vegas' top gentlemen's clubs, it's no surprise that you'll encounter tons of gorgeous ladies eager to entertain the throngs of tourists that flock to the club daily.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a diverse mix of women, even though there were hundreds of girls in the club that night.  Prepare to be hustled hard, though, as those hundreds of girls are all vying for the attention of as many of the guys as they can.\n\nValue - 4 Stars\nAs you'd expect in the heavily tourist-infested Las Vegas area, expect to pay a premium for drinks.  I forked over $14.85 for a rum & orange juice, one of my go-to drinks if I'm not in the mood for champagne or beer.  Couch dances are available at $20.00 per song and are out in the open, but be sure to keep your hands to yourself.  Champagne court prices range from $150.00 for a 15-minute champagne court with a two-drink minimum to $1,000.00 for an hour.\n\nWebsite & Social Media - 4 Stars\nSpearmintRhinoLV.com has a simplistic yet elegant design and provides information about their location, entertainers, bottle packages and awards.  I didn't see any links to social media on their website, but Spearmint Rhino can easily be found on Facebook and Twitter.
