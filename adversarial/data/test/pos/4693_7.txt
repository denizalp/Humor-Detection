Got a good deal on a flight to Toronto with Air Canada. \n\nRead a lot of my fellow Yelpers reviews. We entered this flight with no expectations. \n\nThe pilot and flight attendants greeted EACH passenger at the beginning of our flight. I want to stress the word EACH. Not sure why, but I've been on a number of flights in which the flight crew pick and choose who they want to greet. It was refreshing to see this team equally welcoming to ALL their passengers. The flight attendants were incredibly friendly, professional and helpful. As far as service goes, it has greatly improved from my past experiences with this airline. \n\nThey offer complimentary drinks and pretzels for those of us flying coach. The pretzels were greatly appreciated. I've been on flights in which they won't offer any complimentary snacks. \n\nObviously when flying coach, tighter seating is to be expected. However, these seats were much tighter than some other coach seats I've sat on. The tray table was quite dirty. The fabric lining the chairs were old, stained and ripping. Work needs to be done on the cleanliness and maintenance around the passenger seating area. \n\nAll in all, 3 stars because we didn't break the bank flying to Toronto and the employees were incredibly hospitable.
