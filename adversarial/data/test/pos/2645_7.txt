I like here because they have exercise ingenuity of menus.It is like a unique dining experience! From my point of view, combination of interesting ingredients, so they makes us have fun by a novel fusion of Vietnamese and American meal. And their Pickles are so delicious! My husband likes their pickles too, even he isn't good at all pickles.I am looking forward to eating new menus!!
