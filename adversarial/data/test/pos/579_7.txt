How to share you my experience so you can learn how horrible this experience was. If you told me to bring extra cash to bribe my way into the night club, then you should of told me on the ticket for the night swim! I easily could of brought more money to pay off your bouncers that didn't let anybody in the club!!\n\nXS use to work with pre-sale tickets, which meant we were allowed to get in without the hassle of staff asking for bribes to cut in line. We waited 2 hours to hear the same bounce say \"get your tickets ready..\" why? so we can stand in the same spot we did 2 hours ago? This has to be the biggest joke ever...... \n\nCheck out the photos you can definitely see these bouncers asking for money just to go into this \"express bribe pass lane\" to get ahead of everyone else that has pre-sale tickets. Those that had pre-sale tickets just had to pay another $20 on top of their ticket to get into the front and skip this line.\n\nSo you have 3 lines (1 for tables... ok, 1 for general admin and PRE-SALE tickets..., and 1 empty VIP LINE BRIBE PASS LINE) Clearly it does say something about the club. Thanks XS for making me have a horrible experience.
