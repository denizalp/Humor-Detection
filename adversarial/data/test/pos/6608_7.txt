I stopped by this See's located upstairs inside the Meadows Mall to pick up some Irish Potatoes. It's been a tradition in my family each year to have one and I was really bummed to find out they were completely sold out for the season. Not only were they sold out at this location, but every other location as well online. Since divinity is the center of the Irish Potato, I decided to buy a Divinity Chocolate Egg from their Easter goodies selection and the only difference was the outside of the egg, but the inside of the egg at least gave me a little bit of that Irish Potato feeling I was looking for. I also picked out a Peanut Butter Chocolate Egg for hubby and I received zero complaints. I can't come to See's and not pick out a few of my favorite chocolates and it's a real treat that this same location is here after all of these years. So many businesses have came gone and even relocated in the mall yet this See's location is still here! Pat, one of the awesome ladies that worked behind the counter for many years is now retired, but after 20 plus years, Roberta is still behind the counter ready to happily bag, box and wrap up your goodies as well give you that sample of chocolate that we all look forward to. The only real drawback to this location is the size. There isn't a whole lot of room to look around if it's busy and during certain holidays it definitely gets crowded. Don't forget to ask about any current promotions such as limited time chocolates in the glass case as well coupons off your next purchase. Right now they have Chocolate Caramel Lollypops for a limited time.
