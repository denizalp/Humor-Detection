I was a loyal and great customer from 2002 through 2013. I spent hundreds of dollars in there over more than a decade. I was shocked by my last transaction there. Kay didn't even have me put on the shirt I needed an inside button sewed on. She just took the shirt, though I kept trying to make sure she knew where it needed to be. The next day, I picked up the shirt. That night, I had my first shift at a new job but found that she had not sewn the button at the right spot, so it was pointless, and I had to quit my new job because I wouldn't be able to wear the uniform. I called very upset, and Kay would not take responsibility for having done anything wrong and was very rude to me....even hung up the phone on me! I was stunned that this was how she treated such a longterm and devoted customer. I have not gone back since. Awful business practices.
