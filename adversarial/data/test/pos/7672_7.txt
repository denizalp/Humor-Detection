A friend of mine recently moved to Maine and has been torturing me via social media with constant pictures of lobster rolls. Did you know, out by Bangor, they have vending machines that sell lobster dirt-cheap that are restocked daily?! That's crazy!\n\nLobster ME doesn't have vending machines, but they do have lobster rolls- stick to the classic Original Maine style with a touch of mayo and spices, or dare to try the new Beltway version with Old Bay, shallots, chives, and breadcrumbs. Anything else is blasphemous. \n\nIf you're really feeling daring, add on the chowder fries and a drink for an extra $6- they're like chili cheese fries, but with chowder instead of chili, plus green onions and bacon bits. They're downright intoxicating, if you have the calories to spare.\n\nBonus star for quick service and 20% off local discount- it's a smallish (hot-dog sized) but meaty roll for $17, which is actually on par with pricing in other landlocked states (so minimal Strip markup?), but the discount makes it especially nice. A $20 lunch, which is pretty much the minimum for the Strip, and the quality is actually really good for a food court-style setting.
