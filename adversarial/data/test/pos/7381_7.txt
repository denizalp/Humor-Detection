I went because of Vanessa and Jessica's reviews, but my experience wasn't like theirs.  \nPros:  Smells nice, sunny, clean, good work.\nCons:  TV on with obnoxious movies, took 2 hours, stopped and started pedicure.  \n\nStory: I made an appt the day before for a 1:00 pedicure.  When I arrived, place had two customers getting manicures.  I waited 5 minutes, then they put me in a water bath. Then, I waited 40 minutes for someone to start the pedicure!  Once you are in the water its hard to leave and I kept thinking it would start.  There was some obnoxious war movie on the screen and then a Harry Potter flick.  I felt like a captive.  I was ready to ask for a towel and leave, when the tech came over and started my pedicure.  Great, right?  No, she kept stopping - to talk to her kids who arrived, to take someone else to the dryer, etc, etc.  The pedicure was good quality but it should not have taken two hours to do.  \nI felt sorry for a woman who sat next me waiting with her feet in the tub for 15 minutes.  She wanted a mani-pedi and after they started, they told her they don't do acrylic nails.  I thought they should have asked her what she wanted before starting the pedicure, so she wouldn't have to go to two separate places.  Made me feel they were kind of desperate for the business.
