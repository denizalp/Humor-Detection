Ok, let's talk about it...imagine the BEST grilled cheese you have ever had - now times it by ten and you probably still aren't even close to the deliciousness that is Melt. This place was Amazing! Melt was highly recommended by every person we talked to when we said we were going to Cleveland. Our wait was about an hour, which was fine because then I was good and hungry by the time we were seated. When we ordered, we were greeted by a very laid back and uber helpful waiter. He was awesome and gave incredible recommendations about how to best upgrade\/compliment your sandwich. He even talked my tablemate out of getting her original order and suggested her to get a sandwich more specific to Melt. This is something I can truly appreciate.  He definitely helped to make our experience all it could be. Our table had a variety of selections - The Kindergarten, The Dude Abides, The Big Popper...etc...everyone enjoyed their sandwich. Your sandwiches come with coleslaw and french fries. You will NOT leave hungry. The portions were seriously huge. The bread is thick and toasted to perfection. I ordered tomato soup and clearly did not need it. If you are in Cleveland, you must go to Melt.
