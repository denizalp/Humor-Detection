Irene from Caravan Coffee & Dessert Bar of Mt. Holly told us of the \"great food (specifically breakfast fare) served here at two-months' old Mount Holly Grill, which used to house Black's Bluewater Seafood and Grill.  I was apprehensive of the quality of food I was going to find, since this definitely looked like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, and the indoor layout and furnishings didn't do much to smash my apprehension of dining here.  However, my inquiry into what went into the Alfredo sauce (heavy cream, not cornstarch) used in one of today's specials, Fettucine Alfredo with either chicken or shrimp, made me feel less anxious.  This entree came with a house salad, but I asked if fries could be substituted, instead (yes).  It also came with tea, which I gave to my sis.  She ordered a chicken salad sandwich, with fries.  I also ordered a cup of coffee- great aroma and flavor, but made my stomach hurt- I suspect it might be of the bagged variety.\n\nThe chicken fettuccine Alfredo was delicious!  It came with broccoli and cauliflower florets and carrot slices. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mount-holly-grill-mount-holly?select=gt-sDCaJKcDTu57GeKRcZw#gt-sDCaJKcDTu57GeKRcZw  I was going to ask for a shaker of grated parmesan to thicken the sauce a bit and add a little bit more cheese flavor, but decided to have a taste, and I found I didn't need to ask for anything more- the salt content was just right.  Sister also loved this dish.  The pasta, which was prepared just a tad over al dente (read: a little too tender), was also accompanied with a buttered piece of Texas toast, which I enjoyed.  I was told that the fries would take a little while longer, and they indeed arrived much later, when I was about two forkfuls away from finished (lots of leftovers).  They were of the crinkled-cut frozen variety, but crisped and salted perfectly.  While the Alfredo sauce was thinner than I would like, its flavor and mouth-feel were satisfying-enough-- so content to find a diner\/dive that didn't use cornstarch slurry as a thickener!  (I wonder if their biscuits and gravy will be a safe bet for me should we ever return?  I most likely won't, as this was my first visit back to Mt. Holly in 25 years!)  My sister really enjoyed her chicken salad sandwich and fries. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mount-holly-grill-mount-holly?select=IHIVhQFaOERhT5qE_BhePQ#IHIVhQFaOERhT5qE_BhePQ  Generous portion of chunky chicken salad (sis remarked that it was not overladen with mayonnaise), lettuce, and a thick slice of tomato sandwiched between lightly-toasted white bread. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/mount-holly-grill-mount-holly?select=qOlyg6dZcOtDJD97dAu01A#qOlyg6dZcOtDJD97dAu01A\n\nFriendly and efficient service, and it seemed like the wait staff knew most of the customers there.  I was surprised to find that the women's restroom had cranberry-painted walls, cranberry candle sconces, a photo frame (albeit falling apart), and even a side table to place a handbag on.  I'd say the restroom had better ambience than the dining hall.\n\nI met one of the owners (or perhaps there's only one owner), Milton Suarez, who rang us up at the end of the meal- you bring your receipt to the podium, of sorts, before exiting the establishment.  We told him that we'd met a coffee shop clerk who told us about MHG, and so I'd asked if it had just opened up.  He said, \"Yes.  A couple of weeks, well, one, or two months.\"  Funny answer, that, but he's a nice-enough guy...\n\nShould we return to Mt. Holly again, we most likely won't return here, as I'll be looking to another restaurant to Yelp about, but I'd like to wish good luck to the new owner\/s of Mt. Holly!
