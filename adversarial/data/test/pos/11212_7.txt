I had this place bookmarked because I love crepes. I was down in this neighborhood and hungry soooo it was time to stop by and try it.\n\nIt wasn't quite what I was expecting because its more of a ice cream parlor style place than a restaurant style place. Only about 6 tables inside. \n\nSince I stopped at 11 am, I was the first and only customer as this place opens at 11 and goes to 10pm. The lady working there was very nice and friendly. \n\nI ordered the mixed berry fruit crepe with whipped cream. It was good sized and full of fresh fruit. They mixed the whipped cream inside the crepe so it had a little bit in each savory bite. \n\nI will come back and try it again.
