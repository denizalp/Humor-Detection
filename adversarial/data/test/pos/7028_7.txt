As egotistic as this sounds I often get compliments on my smile. My secret? Brushing, flossing, retainers, and biannual checkups at Bright Smile! Alright I lied, I don't floss, but that's why we go to the dentist rightttttt?\n\nI've been a patient at Bright Smile for something like 7 years. The staff is quick, I always get a reminder post card, a day before reminder call, and dentist swagbags. The procedure is always the same, I get walked in, get some x-rays, say hi to the dentist, get my teeth cleaned, polished, and swagbag! I've accumulated so many Oral-B toothbrushes, Crest toothpaste, floss and mouthwash that I don't know what to do with them. I have the luxury now of just taking my free stuff to a trip and just tossing it after. \n\nTheir new location can be a little difficult to find when all the offices and buildings look exactly the same. Take a right turn at the round-a-bout on Post and go all the way down in the business complex. \n\nTheir office is incredibly accommodating. I don't know how many times I've (naively) made appointments in the morning, but miss my appointments (oversleeping of course) and reschedule the same day!\n\nBy the way I hate the word swagbag.
