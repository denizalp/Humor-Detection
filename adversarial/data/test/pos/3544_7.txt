Fifteen dollars doesn't buy you much nowadays.    Robotic penguins in Chinatown.  Five subway tokens.  Two extra value meals perhaps....\n\nBut at Nazareth it buys you dinner for two AND two bottles of beer.\n\nI think that's noteworthy enough to recommend this place.    The food is quite good and the ambience is always busy and sorta-hipster.    \n\nOne woman seems to do everything here.  She cooks.  She cleans.  She serves.  She has so-so conversational skills.\n\nIt's quite ok.
