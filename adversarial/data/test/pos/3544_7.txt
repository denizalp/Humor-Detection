We tried origination based on a friend's recommendation and we weren't at all impressed.\n\nWe constantly had to flag down the waitresses since they were too absorbed by the content of their phone. It took forever to order, even longer to get our food (all the tables who have ordered after us got their food before us) and even longer to get our water cups refilled. We were then charged extra for the mini noodles we got for checking in on Yelp. All in all, the service was horrible.\n\nFood wise, we each got a diy bowl of noodles. I got the tomyum soup which turned out to be surprisingly spicy despite the lack of indication on the menu (all the spicy items are indicated by a chili pepper on the menu). I did not like my dish at all, the soup. Apart from burning my throats from its spiciness, was too sour to drink and there were chunks of lime inside. Not much toppings from the chosen list was added and the noodles were just the typical rice noodles you buy in the supermarket for a dollar a pack. \n\nOverall, we both concluded that we most likely won't be coming back.
