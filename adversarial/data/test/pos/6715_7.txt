Ye's sushi is ayce sushi combined with Mandarin (but better quality food). The self serve salad\/dessert bar is the main differentiator between Ye's and other GTA sushi spots. \nIt definitely cuts the waiting time because you can get food as you please.\n\nService is really friendly and the restaurant itself is massive and a really great place for celebratory group dinners. Their food is comparable to Heart Sushi but Heart always takes the cake with the sashimi!\n\nI can't remember the exact prices, but I remember the lunch ayce price is pretty good!
