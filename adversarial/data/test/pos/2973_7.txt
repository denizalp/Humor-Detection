It's a bar. There's some sand. Some waitresses are more concerned about their looks than their customer service skills. It's just a typical, average, North Scottsdale bar.\n\nThe location is highly convenient, and there's never a line to get in. Even when this place is packed, it doesn't feel that packed. They have ample room inside and out so you never feel squished. It's usually pretty easy to find a table but it's definitely not as easy to find a waitress\/waiter that wants to serve you, especially when it gets crowded. During one of our many Sandbar visits, our waitress was so MIA that one of the security guards started acting as our waiter... It was pretty funny to say the least.   \n\nWhen I used to live up in N. Scottsdale, Matt and I would come here for NFL Sunday football all the time. They were also pretty accommodating when it came to changing the channel so that each of us could watch our favorite teams. I always requested the 49ers, and Matt needed to see his SeaChickens. They would even change the channel for our friend, a die-hard Buffalo Bills fan (yes, they still exist), without thinking twice. I truly appreciate a bar that accommodates fans of different teams outside of the one that happens to be playing the Cardinals that week.\n\nThis is also a fun place for Happy Hour Mon-Fri. They have great specials, and the drinks get the job done. As far as bar food goes, Sanbar's menu isn't amazing but it isn't horrific either. There have been may times when I've made a meal out of their bottomless bucket of chips and salsa. As far as the crowd goes, it's kinda random. You'll see groups of coworkers enjoying some after work brews, lots of out-of-towners, young 20-somethings getting their drink on, old creepy guys with fake tans. But for the most part, this place turns into a party scene at night. Although I am totally not a UFC fan at all, Sandbar hosts a lot of UFC nights where they put the game on the big screen projector TV, and people can reserve seats\/tables in advance... just as an FYI for all of you UFC people out there. \n\nI know what to expect from Sandbar, and it's an A-OK place in my book. I'd recommend it to anyone in N. Scottsdale looking for a fun, reasonably priced bar for happy hour or a night out. However, this just isn't a bar that I would drive out of my way to get to.
