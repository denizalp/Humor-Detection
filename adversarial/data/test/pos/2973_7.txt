I feel though this mall is headed downward. This mall has become very \"urban\". The customers to this mall are thug wannabes and people who like to scream on their cellphones. Some major chair type stores have left so there are a few empty stores within the mall. \n\nI do not feel comfortable going to this mall alone.
