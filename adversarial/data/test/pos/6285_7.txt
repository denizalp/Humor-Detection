I'm not exaggerating. This is the best Chinese restaurant in central, if not the entire state of Illinois. When you walk in all you see are Chinese people laughing and having a good time. The entire menu is in Chinese so you either have to remember the number or have a local that can read the menu here. I was skeptical at first when someone told me that this was the best Chinese food. After one bite of their crispy tofu, I shed a little tear of joy and just kept eating.
