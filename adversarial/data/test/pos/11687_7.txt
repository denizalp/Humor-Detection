According to reports (admittedly, on their own web site), the South Carolina Strawberry festival has been rated as South Carolina's event of the year. It is possible that there is more going on and we just missed it, or it is possible that South Carolina just doesn't have a lot happening - but either way, this may not be the event of the year. Now to give the event credit, it is a week long, and it is held at multiple venues. We only checked it out on one night, at the park. The farm. the golf club, the dairy barn? Missed 'em. So there could be a whole lot and that is what makes the event, so keep that in mind.\n\nAt the park, however, it is not a lot different than most other events held in and around Charlotte. You'll find a bunch of booths set up around a park, and lots of people trying to hawk their wares. Every sort of craft you can imagine - from clothes for dogs to creative re-purposing of all sorts of recycled materials. And of course food. Lots of food. Including the bordering-on-famous deep-fried honey bun. This thing was ingenious. The deep-fried brownies, not so much, but that honey bun? Awesome.\n\nThere were also bands playing, and your fairly typical festival food found all around. The nice thing is that the booths were, for the most part, spread out all around the park, which is a nice change from something like Festival in the Park, which can be tough to navigate at times. Lots of room to spread out here. The only downside is that there were not a lot of strawberries to be found. I guess that was done on another day.
