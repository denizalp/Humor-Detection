If you want a truly painful customer experience when shopping for your flooring materials, this is your place to shop.  They have an antiquated point of sale system that sucks your time while you wait for them to find your account and robs them of any level of efficiency. You will stand in line forever waiting for their cashiers to complete a simple transaction.  Ironically, they often have several people standing around at the cashiers station chatting and doing anything other than serving the customer.  For each transaction, they will ask you for your phone number. However, they can never apparently get it entered correctly.  I have purchased a couple thousand dollars worth of items, yet few can be retrieved for review.  Try returning something without that record (unopened and un-used - anything else is not accepted) and they'll look at you like you're a criminal drug addict trying to rip them off.  By contrast, return something at Home Depot or Lowes by simply providing your credit card that was used for the purchase.  Avoid this place.
