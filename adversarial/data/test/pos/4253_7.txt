This place epitomizes generic. I've been unlucky enough to be dragged here at least 3 or 4 times by one of my girlfriend's friends and every time is the same blur of aging yuppies and redneck douchebags.\n\nThe whole place screams of suburbian blandness; down right to the food and the wall decor. They do have a decent beer selection but 99% of the patrons stick to light beers or some other cocktail.\n\nOverall, it's not painful but not an ounce of originality or individuality here.
