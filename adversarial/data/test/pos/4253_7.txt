My mother always said hate is a strong word but I think I hate this place. Let me set the scene:\nExhausted mom of a 7-month-old baby (who happens to be teething AND is sick) excitedly orders insalata di rucola, frittura mista (this was just auto corrected to frittura mistake! Ha!), diavola, and the panna cotta. Yes, yes,yes... This was all for me. I'm still nursing the baby so I'm burning through calories. I'm starving!  Nearly one hour later (fine.. Not ideal but I can handle that) the food arrives. I'm speechless. Take a look at the picture. The panna cotta is literally a hot mess. Disgusting. The pizza is cold and looks like it was sitting around all day I don't understand what happened here! I live a few blocks from this place. Did the delivery dude do some boxing-week shopping before dropping by with my food? Did the kitchen pack my panna cotta with the pizza? What the bleep!\n\nRegarding the taste of the food, the salad dressing was super sweet. The ingredients themselves I think were actually quite nice.. It was just hard to taste through the dessert-like dressing. The pizza had good components too.. Especially that spicy salami. It was just old by the time it got here. \nI wasn't a fan of the frittura mistake, although the dipping sauce was really good. The basil really came through yum yum\nI'm still dumbfounded by the panna cotta. \n\nHere's the joke: when I'm hungry I go crazy and have super low standards.\nTime to email the restaurant. Yep, after taxes and tip $70 down the drain. Needless to say, I do not recommend this place.
