After going to the location in yountville I was extremely excited to try lv's location. \n\nthe bread is the most delicious baguette ever. same one they serve at the yountville location. so so good.\n\nappetizer- seafood platter!!!! the oysters, lobster, etc. were TO DIE FOR. the sauces complemented the seafood beautifully and the seafood was so fresh it tasted sweeeet.\n\nentrees- the trout with toasted almonds and green beans- DELICIOUS. the atlantic char I had at the yountville location was also the standout. I really think bouchon's seafood is their strong point.  per the waiter's suggestion we also got a chicken entree. it was good but nothing life changing.\n\ndessert- again per the waiter's suggestion we ordered a lemon tart type ditty. it was meh. at the yountville location we ordered the caramel flan which was also meh. I think bouchon's desserts are definitely their weak points. \n\nnonetheless a very memorable and wonderful meal!
