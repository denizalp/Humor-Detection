Great! I just realized my sales associate didn't give me a lock and key with my purse. This location will be getting a very very angry phone call from me later today. Very disappointed. If you do make the mistake of buying from this location, I would suggest you don't do what I did and not check your items. You trust them that everything will be correct and sadly you get home to find out it's not. Ugh!
