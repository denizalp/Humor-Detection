After our first visit to Forequarter, I am sure that it will be our last. \n\nThe food was not as good as I expected. To be honest, it was horrible. We went for dinner on Saturday around 5:30 pm. Although the restaurant was not crowded, we had to wait for a long time for our first dish, which was the deep fried mushroom that everyone raved about. Also, it felt like forever for the main dishes to arrive at the table. I've been to many $$$ restaurants, and personally I felt that with the $$$ standard, the service was unacceptable. \n\nLet's talk about the food. The deep fried mushroom was overwhelmingly bitter. The deep fried mushroom was not crunchy at all. It was hard to believe because it was deep-fried. The black garlic sauce was so bitter that after I finished it, all that left was bitterness down my throat, as if I just chewed and swallowed medicine. \n\nFor the main course, we each got something different. One of us got the pasta, which was mediocre. The pasta was cooked al-dente but there was nothing else in it except the pasta and mushroom. Another friend of mine ordered the slow cooked pork belly, it was quite burnt just from its appearance. The flavor was okay, nothing really stood out. I ordered the koji marinated poussin, which I was told to be a bird, similar to chicken. When the waitress handed me the plate, I was so close to ask her if it was burnt and asked to bring it back to the kitchen but I didn't say anything since we waited too long for the food and we had somewhere else to go to afterwards. I am not a professional cook, but I know the difference between a charred piece of meat and a burnt one. My three pieces of poussin were completely burnt. I understand that it could be due to the koji marinating, but it was still unacceptable for me with the standard of this restaurant. They say your appetite increases when you see a pretty plate of food, this whole experience so far at Forequarter was a big let-down. My poussin dish was very unappetizing to look at, let alone I have to eat it because it costs $22. The meat was also completely dry and flavorless.  At the end of our dinner, I decided to ask the waitress why the poussin was so burnt. Her response blew my mind, \"It's supposed to be how BBQ meat is like.\" I laughed in my mind, \"Yeah right, between a charred BBQ meat with a nice caramelization and a burnt one, which one would you eat?\" Oh well!\n\nIf you care for your health (burnt food gives you cancer) and don't want to spend $$$ on food that doesn't match its restaurant's reputation, please do yourself a favor, and don't come here.
