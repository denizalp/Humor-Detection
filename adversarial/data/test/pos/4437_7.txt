Very easy hike, highly recommended for beginners!!! \nTrail is paved and loops around the widely shaped mountain. Incredible views at night, the only complaint is the lack of better and closer parking, The parking adjacent to the mountain is limited to about eight spaces, with not so close parking near by! \nOther than that small bump, this mountain is great!!! :)
