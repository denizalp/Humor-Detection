This park is a perfect fit for this neighbourhood due to the downtown proximity and the residences surrounding it.  Victoria Memorial Park pays its due respects to those who fought in the War of 1812 in Fort York.  Victoria Memorial Park has a look and feel of a micro Central Park and is a great place for those to realx and to spend time with your dog.  This is an important part of downtown Toronto as well as a historic piece of Canada that everyone should visit and learn about.
