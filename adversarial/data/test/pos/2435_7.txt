I called several times last week and kept getting an answering machine. Finally, early Friday morning I broke down and left a vm letting them know I was a new customer and I wanted to try to get an appointment for the following week. It is now Wednesday afternoon the following week and I still haven't gotten a call back. I guess they don't need my business. I will take it elsewhere.
