Can I tell you how fun Sat was?\n\nI got the pleasure to walk in Phoenix Pride Parade with Cox Communications, Cox is a great company that supports the Human Rights Campaign and diversity in the workplace.  The parade started lil after 10am along 3rd St from Thomas to Indian School Rd.   \n\nIt was great seeing the many companies that where in the parade as well, US Airways was in the house, Starbucks was handing out Ice Coffee or Ice Tea to workers, Macys, Chipotle, couple of high school marching bands and some valley churches and much more. It was just great seeing everyone walking in the parade and just showing support!\n\nNow as for the parade watchers on the sides of the street, man what a very conservative crowd, it was like they were frightened to clap, laugh or yell, and I know us folks walking for Cox were having some crazy fun, but nope the crowd didnt get into it. I expected more out of the crowd dangit!\n\nAfter the parade we headed on into the pride festival at Steel Indian School Park and once you walk in you see couple of huge tents for shade, I can personally say I was greatful for that, took a break from walking and chilled at a table with chairs and a huge fan! Kept me nice and cool. There was many booths to check out, food trucks & booze. Alot to keep anyone entertained, for me its the drag queens! Love watching the queens!!!\n\nFor those closed minded peeps, I walked in the Phoenix Pride Festival straight and walked out still straight, so I guess its not contagious, and I do have to admit there was some good looking men, but it was like being placed in a candy store with your jaw wired shut. I can look, but not touch. It was a very great time!  Look forward to walking in the parade next year, just hope the crowd learns how to loosen up and cheer by then.
