This place is totally Madison rich people food. It's expensive but delicious. There are only a few meat options, but that means it's vegetarian friendly. It's not full service, so not full tipping makes it cheaper (though most people will tip the same here anyways. Way to work the market). The place is always full for brunch so that means you're at a place that other people want to eat. If you get tired of the long lines to wait through you can always people watch. It's all eccentric people and pretty girls.\n\nTLDR; If you like five star reviews you'll like this place.
