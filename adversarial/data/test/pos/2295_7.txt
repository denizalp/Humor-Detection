Stopped by with parents for dinner...pretending we are in LA koreantown...this place's galbi is up there (relatively speaking) with K-town...pretty freaking good!! Shockingly good actually!! This is by far the best Korean BBQ in the valley...I mean by far!!!! They cook for you and do an amazing job!! The galbi is the best by far...the rest of the meat is lacking of flavor but you need to dip into the salt dish and then the sauce with the jalape√±o and the flavor completely changes...it's pretty good with the mixture!! Literally only place we go to now for Korean BBQ...
