Man.. this place used to be so good. Not just this location, but any Native New Yorker. It is a fact that when a restaurant starts adding pictures to the menu, it's downhill..\n\nService was mediocre. But that's not even the reason I was prompted to write this review.\n\nI usually stick with beer, but this time I decided to go for the Blackberry Mojito. I should have known something was amiss when I asked the server if they muddled the mint or not and she looked at me like a deer in headlights.\n\nIt got worse.\n\nShe came back and dropped it off at the table and immediately I knew something was off.. A taste... and then another... and then, \"what in the *** is that?\"\n\nBASIL?!?!?!?!\n\nYeah... turns out, the bartender was out of mint and decided I wouldn't notice if he used basil instead.\n\nFool me once...
