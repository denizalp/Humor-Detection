Finally you, the genius reviewers of Yelp, have gotten it right! I agree that Gyro Time on W Cheyenne firmly deserves a 3 - 3 1\/2 star rating.\n\nThe major problem with Gyro Time is the price of the food. Each gyro, although generously proportioned, is seven bucks or more. Even a Greek God with a brain the size of a rabbit turd can realize seven plus U.S. dollars for a single gyro is outrageous!\n\nWhile paying a total of eighteen bucks for two gyros and a small french fry sucks, the food deserves praise. My steak souvlaki and my significant other's gyro time sandwich were mouth-melting. That means good. And the french fries, although average, got along really well with the creamy cucumber sauce when making love. \n\nSince I was picking my food up to go, I can't say with conviction whether or not the service was good. I will tell you this : The girl that rang up my order used her Library voice in a completely empty restaurant when I asked her a question. I could have taken offense to the way she was acting, but I just took it out on her tip. She got nothing.\n\nBaladie Cafe, atleast in my world, remains the best Greek food in Las Vegas. If I'm ever in the area of a Gyro Time again, I'll probably just fart and drive by. But if I ever make Bill Gates money and crave a fat, meaty gyro, I might think twice.
