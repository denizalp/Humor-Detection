I actually took the advice of a friend and used them. I either need to pick better friends (probably not) or read reviews before making decisions like paying over $200 for auto detailing (most definitely). \n\nFirst let me note that after detailing my car they took off with my keys. I thought for sure I'd gotten them back and then left them somewhere. Even though that's not my style, it can happen. \n\nAfter looking everywhere for over an hour. Through my whole car, through my garage where I'd put stuff from my car, in my house, in the driveway, everywhere, I finally concluded that they'd actually taken off with my keys. WTF? I left a message for them after hours and was told they'd gotten the message at 8:30 a.m. Why then did I have to call (had to do this several times) THEM at 10:30 asking for them to bring me my keys? No clue. They finally brought them to me after finishing up the detail of another car. I confronted them about the keys and about the crappy job they did (more on that later) and they said 'Oh, sorry about your keys' and that they'd redo my car in a couple of weeks when they came back (I intended to keep them washing my car every two weeks - uh, never). That was it. This was after a tip, also. OF COURSE.\n\nAnyway...\n\nI was a little apprehensive about paying this much for detailing because the example my friend used was his own one year old car. My car I've had for 5 years and have moved cross-country in it a couple of times, etc. It's not a pristine, new car.  Also, a young adult, my son, was driving it. You guess what my car possibly looked like. Not dirty, per se, but dirt in the leather, carpets, etc. \n\nI have a dark blue car with light tan interior. I had never, ever had this car detailed. I made clear to them when I called them that my car was older and had never had a thorough cleaning (hence my call to them). I was willing to pay $200 for this. They told me it would take 2-2.5 hours (or possibly more), but you could tell they weren't spending anymore time than 2 hours on this before they had to get going to the next victim, I suppose. \n\nI looked the car over when it was done and began pulling napkins and other small trash that had fallen out from under the seat. I also had to have them come back and re-clean some areas that had totally not been touched. When they were gone I looked and the ashtray was still dirty (not from smoking, I don't smoke), the area under the emergency brake was filthy, the console area had only been opened to put my lost iPod in then left filthy. I was wiping dirt off of areas that were clear to me in the dark, why did they not see these in broad daylight? They do NOT pay attention to detail, even thought their job is detailing.\n\nThen, when the keys were returned, the woman actually had the audacity to say 'well, when we get cars in that condition...' Wait. My car is actually in great condition, but five years of wear and tear leaves marks. It should be easily handled by a $200 detailing. \n\nI think the sign of someone great at detailing cars is actually detailing them perfectly. Not missing huge chunks of the car because you're on tight schedule. But hey, that's me.\n\nAvoid.
