Walked into smiling faces & a helpful crew around 4:45pm, Friday.  It was the perfect timing because about thirty minutes later the restaurant was packed!  A huge flame from the hibachi grill on the right, a small bar on the left, a sushi bar in the far back & in between is the dining area.  Cozy atmosphere.  \n \nAdrienne, our great bartender, was a sweetheart & made my new concoction of a Cherry & Vanilla Vodka spritzer perfecto!  Cody, our server, was absolutely fantastic as well.  He took our order w\/o writing it down & in between getting our hot sauce, he didn't forget a thing.  Friendly, courteous, patient, always smiling, like Adrienne & he knows the menu very well.  Brought everything out accordingly & thankfully my friend received coupons in the mail that he used.  One was a free Shrimp Tempura Roll & a Large Sake, both w\/ the purchase of an entree.  \n\nMy friend & I shared the Filet Mignon dinner that came w\/ Miso Soup, salad, brown rice & veggies.  Our friend had the Shrimp Tempura dinner that also came w\/ the same.  Our tender filet had a teriyaki sauce & the salad dressing was delish mmm!  The shrimp tempura batter was heavier than the usual, but next time I'll see if they could do it lighter.  Both dinners were very filling & large enough to share for the three of us!\n\nI rarely do hibachi anymore unless it's a special occasion, but I will be back to try their sushi & if I do dinner will have to request Adrienne & Cody again.  Awesome!
