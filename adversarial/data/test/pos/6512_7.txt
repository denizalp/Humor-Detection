Super Cool!  Great Name!  Beautiful Space!  I was introduced to Paper Skyscraper in 2003 shortly after moving to the Charlotte area.  Toys, Gadgets, Magnet Puzzles, Tea Pots, Bags, Cards and Stationary of course!  The owners work there and it shows!\n\nMy favorite part of the store is the section of Design Books!  Always something exciting, usually playing some cool music... Last time they were playing \"Mary Ja ane\" by Rick James.   Wish they would have play it today!\n\nFind Fred here!
