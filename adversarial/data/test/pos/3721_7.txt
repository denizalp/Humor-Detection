This is my favorite store to venture into whenever I'm looking for a wonderful housewares and decor.  \n\nSeasonal items are a great find here.  Tons of Fall and Halloween items to decorate with and of course I couldn't leave without my pumpkin spice candle.  \n\nGreat prices on styling furniture, rugs, frames, artwork, kitchenware-which I picked up a nice Rachel Ray skillet for only  $19.99 and a mini marble cheeseboard for $3.99 oh, and some jalapeno jelly-yum and some halloween hand towels, and...\n\nLove this place, I never leave empty handed!
