I feel horrible  for going here. My daughter stuck our drawings down a giant crack in the 3d theatre room. (Where the tank meets the bench. It goes the entire length.  It's obviously unfinished.)\n\n  The tanks were  green. The penguin habitat too small. Even the humus and pretzels were bad,  tasted like they were stored in a freezer defrosted rinse and repeat. The sea lions were swimming in their own feces.  The filtration is a JOKE. The otter enrichment was cute. This place is so big why such small enclaves for the sharks . You're not fooling anyone with the mirrors.\n\nThe only good part was the gift shop. I hope my daughter never asks to go back bc were not.  I can't feel good about supporting odysea after what we saw.
