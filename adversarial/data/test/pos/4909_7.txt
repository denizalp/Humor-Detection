Eight of my classmates and I (including our visiting Professor) came to eat here. Since our visiting professor is from the San Francisco (Ultimate Foodie City) we wanted to make sure we picked something delicious. \n\nWe were recommended to come here by 2 of our classmates and absolutely loved the dishes!\n\nDuring happy hour we chose a couple tapas: falafel ($1), shrimp, scallops, cheese, hummus (DELISH), and a few things. Such a great price!\n\nI shared the spicy chicken wrap and the chicken shawarma with a friend. It was sooo goood! Very flavorful (especially on my sick taste buds).
