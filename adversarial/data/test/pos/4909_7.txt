Once upon a time I use to come to this place to meet friends for late night drinks and to hang out.  That was a long time ago, when it first opened.  Now, I only stop by when I take one of the cars in for servicing next door at Ted Wien auto service, which was the case during my most recent visit.\n\nIt's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks while you kill time.  There are video poker machines on the bar, but since I don't gamble I hung out at one of the tables near the bar and surfed the web on my iPad.\n\nThe bartenders were very friendly and bored.....they'd talk to a rock if they could, so you should have some nice company too.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool neighborhood bar.  They serve food, but I wasn't hungry the day I was there, so no food this trip.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%
