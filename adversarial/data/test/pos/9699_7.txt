I've read a lot of reviews on here about how the place is dirty and the service is terrible, but that doesn't seem to be the case the handful of times that I've come in.\n\nIf anything, the service has always been nice, the food and drinks have been excellent, and there's plenty of food to take home.\n\nTo me, a good server is courteous, helpful, stays on top of things, and has a good personality.  I normally have gotten a \"seafood expert\" with a good sense of humor, and is good at answering questions about what dishes consist of.\n\nMy last meal, I tried their $15 deal, and for what you get, it's worth the price, and easily the best deal.  A soup, a salad, the main entree with a side, and dessert.  The portions are respectable, and as anyone else notes, the cheddar biscuits are seriously good.  I also tried some beverage that has raspberry, blueberry and blackberry in it, and it well made for that \"comfortable zone\" during my meal.  Their booze has always been consistently tasty.  It's kind of crazy to think that they have as robust a bar as they do.\n\nThe last time I went in there it was fairly quiet, and we were seated almost instantly.  By the time we left, however, people were lined up outside and leaving because the place was full.  The parking lot always seems full, so I think it's a matter of picking the best time to go over there.\n\nAll in all not bad.  For seafood chain fare, they are quite decent, and I hope that $15 menu remains a mainstay (but I hope they diversify some options over time).  Not bad.  I came out full and content.  Always a plus for me.\n\nAnd I brought the extra cheddar biscuits home, so I lived the dream for another day or so.
