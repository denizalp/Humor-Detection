I stumbled in this location with my niece since she loves this store. It has been years since I popped in one and I was impressed with their selection, prices and store size. I'm a Banana Republic\/Gap fan and primarily wear your classic basics. Old Navy is part of that family and I was happy to pop by and browse. \n\nWhat you will you find at Old Navy?  A ton of options. \n\nThink plain classic crew or V neck T-shirt and plain jeans. \n\nI ended up picking up two pairs of wide-leg linen pants and two t-shirts for the hot Las Vegas summer days to come. Two outfits for 60 bucks. It was a nice surprise and I will put Old Navy on my rotation to stock up on my basics.  \n\nCome here to stock up on items your tanks, tees, socks, PJs, flip flops, maxi dresses and athletic clothes.  You can grab your basics at a bargain. \n\nGo ahead.... Treat-Yo-Self\n\n\n\n\nYelp Review #10 2016
