THE POOL DECK IS HEATED, the pool itself is also very warm, quite large, and has a slide! Staff are very kind.\n\nDecor: friendly orange blobs painted on the white cinder block walls. \n\nFavourite time: Sunday nights from 6:30-9 they do a women and girls only swim. \nVery comfortable so long as you don't mind swimming freestyle plaid\/thread-the-needle laps around kids playing ring toss and old ladies with flutterboards.\n\nCaveat: I have *never* successfully swum straight laps here for more than about 10 minutes at a time, and once an old lady spat on the floor in the shower.
