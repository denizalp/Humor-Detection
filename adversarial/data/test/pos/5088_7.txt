For all y'all that ain't never been to any of them bomb Hash House A Go Go's you missin out on a hearty meal and dope price. Mah Fat Phucklets know yer boy ain't one to complain about the price of a meal, but I ain't stupid enough to pass up a good deal when I see it. \n\nAt this spot you gettin massive portions and the food tastes bomb. Now if you coming here tryin to eat light and not eat some shit that's gon put you on your ass, this ain't for you bruh. I like me the the Fried Chicken Benedict, but that Chicken and Waffles dank too.
