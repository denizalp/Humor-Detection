There are some places that surprise you, and this place doesn't! A seeming fusion of southern Chinese cuisine and Vietnamese comfort food can launch the restaurant only so far in the road of intrigue without diminishing the quality of either influences. \n\nMy minute samplings of the Chinese dishes were satisfying enough, but I'll limit my review to my portions only. I'd admit the Chinese orders are infinitely more alluring and aromatically than the Vietnamese counterparts, but it's safe to assume the defining element of this establishment is the rare availability of pho and vermicelli in wee late hours. Arriving on a busy Sunday noon time, the wait was still minimal, yet the service was quick and buzzing. There are parking available in the plaza lot, and also plentiful restroom stalls inside in the back.\n\n-Pho Tai Gan: Although this specific dish is not on the menu, you can order pho with the sliced rare steak and tendon. There are only a few pieces of tendon, and the soup base was too light and hinges on the flavorless side, instead of the rich, umami taste I expected for pho.\n\n-Bun Bo Hue: The broth was a translucent and lack a \nclear distinctly sour and salty flavour that distinguishes what is supposed to be a thick red colour soup base. There are three pork knuckles or leg pieces in there, but what I do enjoy is the yummy shrimp chili paste condiment with an in-house-made taste. \n\nFood: 2.5\/5\nService: 4\/5\nAmbiance: 3\/5\nEnvironment: 3.5\/5
