My 90-year-old mother and I came here to find a reclining  chair and we were very impressed with the service we received from Sales Consultant Marina Cole. \n\nMy mom's current and future limitations and needs were taken into consideration in the selection of features in a chair.  She was respectful and patient in taking my mother's likes and dislikes into consideration and offered her helpful suggestions and styles.  \n\nMom was really impressed with the large selection of fabrics they offer.  Fabric swatches can be virtually viewed on any of the upholstered pieces and displayed on a large wall screen.  Of course, my mom thought this was really cool and helpful to her in making a selection.\n\nWith sales consultants like Marina, I would highly recommend this beautiful and spacious store.
