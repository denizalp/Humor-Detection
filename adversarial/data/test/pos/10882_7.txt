So, I'm back to close out my site. I swore I'd never come to this hotel again, but yet... here I is. I check in and am very chummy with both front desk clerks. I joke about needing two room cards because the halls are long and I don't want to walk back there if they don't work. Said I'd sleep in the hallway if that happened. We shared a chuckle. I get my room key and off I went.\n\nI stopped by their cafe to learn that my favorite local bottled iced tea is no longer being offered and that the restaurant is under construction. I mosey onward to my room. I open my door and to my surprise there sits a man. Not MY man. Someone else's man is in my room and he looks pretty settled. He, was just as surprised as I was. My initial thought was: Is Hilton doing uberpool boarding because this is not gonna work for me. I go back to the desk and inform them. They are confused. They discover that another person didn't properly check this guest in and in doing so, gave him my room. \n\nThe front desk manager is apologetic. But not enough for the level of coping that this all required. I mean, I was calm. Not eerily calm but playful, that's ok kind of calm. Understand, that was an act. An academy award winning act that even I shocked myself in pulling off because honestly I wanted to matrix out my can of whoopa** and give them a verbal lashing worse than what Kunta Kente got in physical form. But, I'm a professional and a lady and regardless of my Ally McBeal visions, I handled myself in a way that would not grant me a future behind bars in an outfit that is not designed by either Tahari or Calvin Klein. He and I barter for the apology compensation. In the end, I win. As I digress.... I am reassigned another room.\n\nThis room is not only a mobility room (which clearly states in my profile, I do not ever want), but... it has a roll in shower. **grabs heart and sings 'Take Me to the King'....Truth is I'm tired, options are few, I tried to pray but where are you.'** I decide to suck it up as I'm never not never coming to this hilly podunk town ever again, so help me Oz. I get in the shower and learn it was never cleaned. Sigh... it never ends with this place. \n\nLook, I may not forgive but I'd like to think I'm a pretty understanding person. Unless Ashton Kutcher is jumping out, I prefer a perfect stay. I'm a diamond member for goodness sakes. For eleven years. I meet the diamond quota in the first 6 months. 6 months... that means I travel A LOT. I don't ask for much. Hilton: I just ask for a clean room (with just me in occupancy), a hot shower, AC\/ Heat that works & friendly staff. Why is that so hard. Why. **sings** 'Nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows my sorrow'
