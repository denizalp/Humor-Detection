Let's just cut to the chase. I really like the Grand Lux Cafe. I mean I really, really dig this place!\n\nLocated inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino, the cafe is actually pretty easy to find just off the casino floor and near the escalators from the parking garage. \n\nitems of note..\n\n- the room is MUCH larger than it first appears from the casino floor! With high ceilings and plenty of seating, the room is tastefully decorated and feels upscale.\n- Service is top notch here! At least it has been every time I have been here so far! For our last visit, Casey was our server and he was great! \n-For being a food outlet a)on the strip and b)inside the Venetian, the prices are incredibly fair! It's a great way to enjoy a nice meal and not feel like you're breaking the bank! This was probably the biggest surprise of all!\n- the menu is HUGE! The amount of options available to you is fantastic!\n- this staff hustles! I mean servers and bussers were in constant motion tending to a guest or prepping a table for the next party! \n- Casey was great about keeping drinks filled and checking in with us from time to time without being intrusive. It was perfect!\n\n\nFor this last experience, I ordered the rib eye steak(cooked medium rare) ($27). The steak was cooked almost perfectly! It was so juicy and tender and marinated beautifully! The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty tasty as well! The steak was so good that I decided to enjoy it without any steak sauce or ketchup(which I never do!)\n\nI think this place is a real gem and I will keep returning to enjoy more of the menu! I teetered back and forth between 4 and 5 stars for this review, but given the price point and consistently good service, I have to give it a 5! \n\n5 stars!
