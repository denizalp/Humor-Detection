We were very happy with our decision to use Dignity Moving for our recent move. Lind & Joesph were great and moved super quickly, even in the heat of the AZ summer! They even took the time to bring in a heavy desk we had stored in the garage which was awesome. If you are in search for a quick, reliable and very reasonably priced moving company, this is it!
