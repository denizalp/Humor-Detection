Having been here before I expected to see \"mama\", the owner of Tesoro.  But I didn't see her.  Then the second clue came.  The homemade bread which I was served in a prior visit, was not in the bread basket.  This was mama's homemade bread.  Missing in action.  Then it became real to me.  The restaurant had been sold when I wasn't looking.  No more mama.  \n\nI ordered Pasta Puttanesca which I always adored.  Hubby had to get more complicated.  He ordered something which was not on the menu.  I said don't do it-- you will pay through the nose as the basic dishes are not inexpensive.  He insisted and ordered chicken cutlet with eggplant with sauce--no cheese.  So here's the story.  The waiter, Alan, brings this large dish to hubby with his requested dish.  Kinda large.  Hubby tasted and loved it.  I said, let me have a taste and it was really, really, really, really good.  I mean good.  My puttanesca pasta not so much.  Anchovies--check.  Capers--check, pasta al dente--check; but somehow the pasta did not come together as a dish. I think it was the sauce-- It just wasn't there like before.  Something missing.  Don't know what.  I would not order this pasta again.  But hubby's custom dish was amazing.  It was amazing until we got the bill.  That amazing dish was $28 plus tax and tip by itself.  That's a lot of mula for one chicken dish.  Yikes.  Really, you customize something and it is double the price of your regular dishes?  Holy moly!  I told hubby he was going to pay through the nose.  But he says he enjoyed it immensely.  We have learned our lesson.  Ask for a price before you customize a dish.  (I thought it would be tacky to do such a thing, but apparently it's the way to go unless you want a REAL surprise at the end of your meal.)
