We went here with a big group on a Friday night, a group of 15. There was no wait and the servers were friendly although it took them hella long to get our order even though all of our table was seated. Anyways we ordered beers and sake and we were gonna try the sake sampler nigori flight, but I was told it was super small and not worth it by a friend who had been there before. Anyways for our big group we ordered 3 large boats for 55$ each. I was like whatever because we were with a group but really I am Asian and this deal was the shittiest deal ever. \nFor 55$ you get 2 half or age slices (so basically 1 whole orange) 15 slices of crappy beef\/steak that had no flavor except the teriyaki sauce they dumped onto it. And the chicken looked dry and freeze dried and was absolutely horrible. Also this 55$ boat came with 7 pieces of sushi. I thought it was gonna be at least nigiri but it was actually 2 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, 2 white albacore and a shitty shittay flavorless imitation California roll.\nWhat a disappointment!!! I am so accustomed to have lots of sushi and nigiri and oh the best part of the boat was the tempura. Kinda oily but sadly the best part.\nI would come here again because I had fun with friends but the food was quite Terrible. We also ordered the Kalbi skewers and it wasn't Kalbi it was more like bi-bim-bap on a stick. Also the steak roll were terrible and dry. And the best thing was the sappo roll. Tasty refreshing and real fish. \nThe only thing that made this tolerable was the large Sapporo and sake.\nPs my friend said the Cole slaw was good. \nAnd also I asked for extra ginger an hour ago and it never came.\nSee attached piece of chicken. It was freeze dried and no one ate it because it looked like rubbery dried intestines.
