Good place to go for a quick breakfast. Nothing really sticks out on their menu. Mostly breakfast foods but there are sandwiches, burgers, & salads if you're not much of a breakfast person.\n\nThe pancakes are ok. The beau usually gets the chocolate pancakes with chocolate chips. Pretty darn good. They also have 4 different syrups at the table: regular, strawberry, blueberry, butter pecan. Those are the usuals. \n\nService is usually on the slower side at any location I go to. And don't wait for the waiter to pick up your check, you gotta go up to the cash register to pay. \n\nNot my go to breakfast place but it'll do.
