Heard so much about ramen in Las Vegas, I had to try while I was in town. I bookmarked 3 ramen shops for what it seemed like high rating while I was in a conference. Due to limited time on Yelp search, I didn't read anyone's reviews, just quickly bookmarked highest rated 3.\n\nI picked this one as it was closest from the hotel I was staying. After I ordered my food, the person who sat next to me at the counter said so much good thing about this place over other places I bookmarked.\n\nGyoza was good.  I gave a piece to a stranger sat next to me as he gave me this look that he wanted to try.\n\nRamen..... Well broth was nice and hot... I ate ramen as soon as I took one picture but noodle was soft. It's Hakata thin noodle, perhaps I should have requested barikata (very hard) for my noodle. If their noodle was al dente, I would have given this place 4 stars.\n\nAfter I was done eating I finally saw some reviews from some of my favorite yelpers. They all rated 3... Ah of course.\n\nI looked at the stranger next to me, he ate so slow, his noodle looked soggy.  Either he doesn't know how to eat ramen in Japanese way or too busy talking to me. \n\nIf you like ramen in Japanese way, may want t ask to cook noodle al dente to fully enjoy it's texture.
