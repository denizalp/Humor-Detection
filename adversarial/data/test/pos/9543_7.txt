One of the worst Subways I've ever been to. Note to everyone considering a franchise: if you can't afford to run the business correctly, DON'T DO IT! \n\nAlthough there were three annoying things that  happened at this Subway, I wasn't going to make a public complaint until I opened the sandwich at home.\n\n1. I was about to get the last bit of tuna in the tub, so I asked if there was a fresh one. The guy says \"It's from today.\" This was now 4:30 pm. But, he did replace. \n\n2. I asked for swiss cheese. \"I don't have that today.\" \n\n3. I asked for cup to get water. \"I don't have water. The machine is broken.\"\n\nI bought the sandwich. When I got home and took sandwich out of the bag, it felt wrong. See photo. Yep, the supposed 6 inch sandwich was just 5 inches!
