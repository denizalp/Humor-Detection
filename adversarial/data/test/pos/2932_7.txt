I have been to this place once. The food tastes like amateur home cook dish. They charge you a lot for what they offer in food. In addition to their low value, my main concern with this place is hygiene. Their restrooms are FILTHY. I was shocked by the condition of their restrooms. Imagine employees use the restroom and go back to prepare food! Not sure I feel comfortable going back to that place again after seeing their restroom. The restaurant reminds me of the dining areas of a college dorm. Plus, it is way more expensive than the other food in and around college. My advice, if you want to have a pleasant experience with reasonably priced food, don't bother trying this place. Waste of your time and money. You can definitely have better food with a cheaper price anywhere else in town.\n\nP.S. I am concerned that the restaurant is hiring people to write good reviews for them on Yelp. The food pictures they post in the reviews are nothing like the food you will get from the restaurant.
