So we didn't actually eat here, but the experience was awful. There was a 30 minute wait, and we had initially said \"no thank you, we will pass.\" Then we got swayed (a little desperately) to stay. So we waited about 10 minutes, and both decided that \"hmm, we still really don't want to be here\" and I went in to return the buzzer... the host argued with me to stay and I told her a couple times that \"we're not interested.\" \n\nOverall, I felt like they were very desperate for people to be there and will argue to get you to stay. The restaurant was busy enough, so I don't really understand. We just weren't in the mood to not be able to hear a thing with their blaring music.
