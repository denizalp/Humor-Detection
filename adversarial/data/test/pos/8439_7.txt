This is the Chevron\/ Terrible's gas station\/convenient store\/ car wash located across from Palms Place on Flamingo Road. \n\nThe store its self is fairly well stocked with plenty of variety and decent prices. I guess the thing that stood out the most on my visit here today is the sketchy people that were all over here! There were a lot of panhandlers around, plus some people that were just standing around doing nothing. Very sketchy. It was like they were just casing people. One guy leaning against the wall in the back. When I went to pay, I turned around and there were 2 guys looking right at me from the aisle. They weren't in line or waiting to pay...just standing there. Really freaking odd..like Twilight Zone sh*t. Usually I try not to hold things like this against the business but, reading the other reviews, this has apparently been going on for years and its seems as though nothing is being done to at least mitigate the problem.  \n\nPlus it always seems to be rediculously busy most times and that parking lot just gets overrun with too many cars and people in tight quarters. It can be annoying.\n\nUnless my car happens to die directly in front of this gas station I really don't see myself coming back here. There has to be a better gas station nearby somewhere.....at least I hope the hell so..\n\n2 stars.
