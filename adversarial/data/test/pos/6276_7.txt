My destination was Coquette Patisserie next door. I glanced through the adjoining door at Piccadilly, but I was like, \"I gotta stop somewhere.\" I had already consumed twice my body weight in food and drink that day. Then we were walking past outside and my friend read the sign, \"Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream.\" I was like, \"Whaaa...?\" Liquid nitrogen ice cream; well there was no way I Wasn't gonna try That. \n\nSo I did. \n\nPiccadilly is clearly the Urban Outfitters of ice cream, and yogurt. If there was a Piccadilly pop-up in a UO, you wouldn't be able to tell where Urban Outfitters stopped and Piccadilly started. So imagine that. Artisan ice cream and hipster clothing, without the clothing. For sale. \n\nSo the ice cream: Goat cheese with honey and fig. Mixed in a Kitchen Aid mixer and billowing like a violent bull Holstein with a smoking habit and an exhaust leak. And then, BELUGA!! Ice cream!! Now I'm not one to go around saying stuff like, \"Ah man, check out this hotdog I just got from Bell Stores. This is the best thang I ever ate.\" But I see no reason not to call this the best ice cream I've ever had, because hey, it was.
