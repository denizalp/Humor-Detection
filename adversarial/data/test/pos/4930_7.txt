I walk inside and it's like someone found Martha Stewart's secret craft room and snatched away all the creative treats! I don't even know where to begin with Melrose Vintage. This is the one stop shop for gifts. Why you ask? Well... if you are looking for any of the following either for yourself or a friend, you'll find it here:\n\n- Baby accessories \n- Knicks and Knacks for your home decorating \n- Furniture - both vintage and copy vintage \n- And then there's the craft room...\n\nThe craft room in itself requires a full day of exploration. Upon first glance, I was overwhelmed with excitement when I imagined all the wondrous things I could create with the tools surrounding me. When I looked even deeper, I realized that all of the items are incredibly unique to the store and you won't be able to find them anywhere else or at least not at your typical chain craft store. Everything is hand crafted and begs for a master creative creation. From scrap-booking to crafting exactly like Martha style crafts, you can find it all here. I just don't know if I can ever live up to the possibilities this store offers me! \n\nThe crafting room offers working stations, classes and even a sectioned off play room for children while their mother's explore. The front part of Melrose Vintage is a decorator's paradise and full of every possible home item you could think of. Those searching for the unique baby accessories in their life have a room entirely dedicated to it. \n\nI can't wait to visit Melrose Vintage again to explore some more. I also noticed some unique holiday decorations that I'd like to snatch up!
