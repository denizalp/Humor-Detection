I have been here twice since this place has opened...\n\nFood - Great\nAtmosphere - Great, Just like the Sapporos that was there previously.\nPrices - Opening specials were amazing, Prices on menu were fair\nService - Horrible... All our waitress did was flirt with the manager\/owner and twirl her hair for him while we sat waiting for our roll that she forgot to put in, our waters that needed to be refilled, and lastly the check!!!
