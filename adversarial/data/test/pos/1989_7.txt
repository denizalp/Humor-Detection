Dear Boulder station\nI would just like to inform you of my visit to your property on Tuesday September 9th. My girlfriend and I decided to attend your 7pm bingo session. The woman who gave us our bingo cards was so nice and helpful the cocktail servers were also very nice. When the bingo game started it was a little hard to understand the first caller but then the second caller came on and it was great. Both my girlfriend and I won a game it was amazing UNTIL the highly intoxicated Asian gentleman behind us pulled out his penis and proceeded to pee on the floor right in the middle of the game! At this time the cocktail waitress was walking by. We got her attention and told her what was going on (Michelle was her name). She said she would take care of it. Moments later the man is till sitting in his chair. 20 mins later after bingo was over he was still there no one asked him to leave no one came to clean up the urine on the floor. While leaving we approached the security podium and told Louis I believe his name was about the incident his exact response to us was \"he must spend the big bucks that's why no one told him to leave\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME! I am truly dissatisfied with the reaction of your staff. The lack of health concern for a bio Hazzard that was basically just left and shrugged off. I am completely disgusted at how this situation was handled and even though our night started off amazing I will not be visiting your properties again.
