Service was slow to get going but was attentive and non-intrusive throughout.\n\n------\n\"Stir it up.. ba ba buhm. Little darlin' \"\n\"Stir it up.. ba ba buhm. Little darlin' \"\n------\n\nCocktails were VERY solid.. not 5\/5 but definitely up there. The smoky mezcal was low on the promised citrus, and stiff bourbon had little blueberry to back it. Quality and boozy but not enough balance.\n\n------\n\"Come crawling faster\"\n\"Obey your master\"\n\"Your life burns faster\"\n\"Obey your master\"\n\"Master\"\n------\n\nWhat!? Cure's channel plays the Doors, Bob Marley, and Metallica. What kind of station is this?The food was equally mixed..\n\nThe delicious, well-rounded charcuterie is the most colorful I've seen. Taste the rainbow:\nRED salumi and duck speck are hearty, salty\nORANGE pimenton aioli cuts the fat\nspicy YELLOW mustard adds dryness \nCREAMY cheese smooths all\nbitter GREEN charred asparagus\nand PURPLE beets + pate. Bread was mediocre.\n\nThe muddled tartare had little meat flavor and was drowning in spice that stings your tongue. Good chips alongside. The chicharrones were crisp but inedibly salty.. half our dish sent back.\n\nAll three half-plate pastas looked like vomit in the bowl. They tasted way better though. The well-salted carbonara had a med-hard egg but the pork bits were too large\/chewy. The saly garganelli was very soupy, al-dente noodles floating. The parisian gnocchi was SMALL. 7--count em--7 gnocchi for $13. A light fried texture with a heavy pork and pine-nut note. Very tasty but very pricey.\n\nThe kabocha squash soup was probably the best dish of the night.  Morcilla is too salty\/spiced and not earthy enough but with excellent. The smoked mozzerella foam is delish and the rich squash rich slurp-worthy.
