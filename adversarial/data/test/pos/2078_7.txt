02.06.10\n\n$5 cover.  Opening band = Andrew something.  Rock Lobster was main draw.  They did pretty good cover songs.\n\nNice bartender with a heavy hand is always a plus.  One shot = three gulps!\n\nNo problem securing a booth to goof off in.  Maybe next time people shouldn't stare at us as much?\n\nMultiple rooms, back room has hip hop blasting and stripper poles with all reserved tables.\n\nOutdoor area in the back with a bar as well.  I like multiple options.\n\n***UPDATE***\nI just checked my Amex.  Good thing I did.  First, they charged me more than I signed for.  Second, they added a second transaction for the same over-charged amount.  What kind of service is this?!  Outrageous.
