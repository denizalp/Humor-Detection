I came here Super Bowl sunday, the boys were in the sports book so i figured i would treat myself to a spa day.  I had 3 services scheduled, the chocolate raspberry facial, the dreaming ritual and the nirvana.  \nBefore anything I hung out in the spa area, I was surprised at how dated it was, I wouldn't be surprised if it was original (the MGM is 21 years old).  Also for a womens only spa people seemed very perturbed by nudity.  Whatevs. In the waiting rooms they had apples and nature valley bars as well as cucumber water.\nMy first service was the facial, when we walked into the room there was a floor to ceiling window with blinds that weren't working too well. Of well, my eyes will be closed the whole time.  But then the traffic came.  In hindsight knowing the layout of the MGM i knew the exact street that was behind that window.  Every 5 minutes or so, loud mufflers, noises from trash trucks emptying dumpsters and the beeping of said trucks backing up.  Lovely.  The facial itself was decent, its a very good deep cleaning treatment thats not geared for teen skin like most deep cleaning ones are.  \nNext onto the dreaming ritual.  I think this is their signature service.  Its an aboriginal treatment that starts with a foot soak and scrub, then onto a body scrub, mud wrap and then massage.  I was taken to a big semi private room with entrances then into various treatment rooms.  The serves was good, (upstairs from the noisily window rooms) I liked that they rub the oil onto the body them sprinkle the salt, so if you're sensitive they can tailor it to you.  The shower to rinse off looks amazing, but is really awkward to use, you have one small hand held attachment, and then bolted to the sides are vertical jets you'd expect in a car wash.  I felt beat up, in a really clean way haha.  The massage was good too, i think, i kinda fell asleep for that part... but that means its good right? \nFor my final service, the nirvana, my masseuse was very awkward.  Just socially akward is the only way to describe her.  Her movements seemed hurried an uncaring, she also knotted up my hair trying to get my bun undone.  I was honestly just waiting for it to be over.  \nI also did not like the fact that they add an automatic gratuity.  Not that I would ever not tip, but for example 20% need up being $36 I would feel odd tipping an extra 10 or 15, but not wanting to give a total of $56.  I feel like places like that don't make as much as they could, I typically figure 20% and round up to the nearest 10 or 20 increment.  Also the tooth brushes were preloaded with dried toothpaste as well as I never saw any place to put used hairbrushes to be sanitized.  All in all my total, with 20% gratuity added in was around $750.  The service I got is that that I would expect from the imperial spa, or some place like that.
