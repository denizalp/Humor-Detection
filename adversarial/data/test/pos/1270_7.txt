Other than the awkward, mysterious, FAR walk to the buffet, it was just awesome.\n\nThe peking duck's bun was a bit hard and disappointing, but the wicked fried chicken wings and gnocchi were AWESOME!  Loved the selection and hard working staff.\n\n...Bathrooms are a bit confusing, walked into the men's restroom.  (hello to the guy grunting on the toilet!)
