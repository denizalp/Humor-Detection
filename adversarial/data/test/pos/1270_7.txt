This convention center provides the typical convention center experience, but with the cheesy flair of Las Vegas. Hence, it's called the Las Vegas Convention Center.\n\nIf you come here for a trade show or a convention, be prepared for the usual convention center quirks and chaos such as forklift induced frustration, overpriced food and coffee that borders on hot garbage, and women rocking 4-inch stiletto heels the first day and then flats or flips flops for the last day when they realize standing and walking all day really does hurt. But hey, you get all of this and a cheesy Vegas style Elvis impersonator is thrown in to liven up your experience. Yeah. Okay. Lame.\n\nNormally, I'd give three stars to an average convention center experience, but I was very disappointed they did not run the air conditioning on the first day and last closing hours of the event. This is unnecessary torture for a trade show exhibitor.\n\nWhen you are assembling a booth after a long plane ride in a super hot facility with no AC it's annoying. The following day, you run the AC when the masses arrive so that they can waddle comfortably around to different booths. The AC is runs fine all week and then you inexplicably shut it off on the last day when the masses leave and all exhibitors have to disassemble their booths. That's so frustrating. And plus, it's just bad for business. Remember, exhibitors pay the big bucks and they make certain trade shows happen and for whatever reason, you are too cheap to run the AC for your customers?\n\nDo you think I want to get to the airport with sweaty pits and my once smooth and shiny hair moist, matted, curly and kinky? No. Of course not. So keep running the AC for the convenience of all exhibitors disassembling their booths. \n\nThank you.
