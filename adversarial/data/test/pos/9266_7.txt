PHX: I love landing here. Sun. Blue skies. Sun. Heat. Sun. Unless there is Haboob. No, I didn't make that word up, and if you are a Phoenician, you know what it means. If you aren't and you're traveling to Phoenix, particularly in the summer, you might want to look up the word. If you are able to land before one arrives, you have a legitimate reason for running red lights getting to your destination before \"it\" hits. \n\nMeanwhile back in the airport: If leaving PHX, the plane might be delayed, but getting through security is a breeze as long as TSA pre-check is stamped on one's boarding pass. There are a few places to eat and shop, but don't leave your shopping and eating until the airport, or you will miss  out on all the great places in Phoenix and surrounding areas. Generally, I'm flying Alaska in\/out of here, which means Terminal 2 and no Starbucks. Sad. Alaska Airlines=Seattle=Starbuckaholics. Who made that bad business decision?\n\nI'm not sure about the claim of \"friendliest airport,\" as there really isn't much interaction anymore. I checked myself in using the kiosk, placed my luggage tag on myself, tossed my luggage on the belt, showed my ID and went through security. Hung out for a while reading my book until I boarded, when I placed my phone over the scanner and walked on. \n\nUntil next time, PHX.
