When you're used to JetBlue nd VirginAmerica, it's hard coming here. I've had bad flights with Jet Blue (gonna be posted as well) and VA but they have the comforts I like. \n\nSouthwest doesn't have a order of seating - first ome, first serve. Not bad. It was an empty flight so I was good. Free bags.\n\nThey don't have a TV, good snacks, good beverages but eh, an hour flight. \n\nSeats are alright. \n\nOverall, this isn't bad for a short trip.
