is it weird to be in love with a walgreens location? i consider this MY walgreens.\n\ntoday i went and guess what- they have like mini dr. offices there to write prescriptions!!!!!! its my new favorite thing!!!!!!! its so hard to get in to see my doc so this totally makes me super happy. \n\neveryone is so nice here and this store is so clean and the restrooms don't have those annoying keypad locks that the rest of the walgreens restrooms have. \n\nya, i could go on why this is the alpha location but i wont. i just love this place. esp the 'as seen on tv' aisle.  (btw- the smooth away does not get rid of any hair-fine, course, medium, nada- dont buy one)
