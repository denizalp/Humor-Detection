My office typically orders Jason's to go, but if you feel like getting out, it's worth it.  Kind of a pain to get to but the salad bar is serious business.  For $7.99, you get unlimited trips to the small, but well-rounded offerings, fluorescent glow included free of charge.  It's not a huge salad bar, but it has everything you need to have a good lunch.  Added bonus:  Captain's Wafers!  Those crackers take me back to childhood!  I would suggest avoiding the patio though, as there is always some vagrant milling about.\n\nIf you are not looking for an excuse to be less productive, Jason's delivers ($3 charge I think) and I would recommend the turkey reuben.  Super good and under 550 calories with baked lays and a pickle.
