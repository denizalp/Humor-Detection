I thought I would do things differently and give everyone 5 big tips for attending this convention. The quick and dirty summary of this event is that it's 4-days long, catered to multiple fandoms (e.g., comics, games, anime, sci-fi, and horror) and is located in the city of Toronto lols. The last time I attended Fan Expo was like decades ago, probably when I was in High School. Things have changed quite a bit, as you can see, we get pretty big stars that come...including Aqua Man and the casts from Back to the Future. I happened to buy some super discounted tickets ($50 for 2 adults and 3 children) so thought I could drop by on a Sunday. \n\n1. Go for the freebies FIRST\nTypically, bags and posters are free items (good for companies to use as advertisements). If you are feeling hungry, some organizations choose to give out food right outside of the venue. I got free RAW cookie dough and it sucked, but it was found outside the South Building.\n\n2. Go early and avoid driving\n\n3. Pick the right day\nFan Expo takes place over a span of 4 days. Thursday is extremely short, you have about 4-5 hours to explore the entire place. I'm going to tell you right now that it's impossible to experience everything. You might think you will see everything in the Exhibitor's Hall but how about all the other activities? Going on Saturday is actually the best day - this stays true for Anime North (taking place in May).\n\n4. Don't buy food at the convention\nYou want to know the prices for convention food? It costs $10 for 1 slice of pizza, a bag of chips, and a pop. Holy cow, that should cost $6-7 max outside the convention.\n\n5. Take photos\nYou are going to see some awesome cosplays, whether it's Superman, Mario, or a Stormtrooper. Don't be shy and ask for a photo. In fact, take it a notch further and be in that photo! I see that a lot of kids get excited when they are surrounded by Super Heroes, don't let your kid forget that moment.
