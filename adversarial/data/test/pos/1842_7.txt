This was one of our favorite meals in Montreal. I love game meat, I love foie gras, et j'adore la cuisine Québécoise, so I was in heaven here. However, you should probably not go here and expect an elegant fine dining experience. It's pretty small, very crowded, and very loud, and has a very casual interior with wooden tables - it's not a place you necessarily need to get dressed up for. You definitely need a reservation if you don't want to stand waiting for hours; we had a reservation and got seated within about 15 minutes, but there were people who got there before us that were still waiting 2 hours later.  Despite the inventiveness of the menu and the relatively high prices, the food is not really haute cuisine per se. However, that does not make it any less delicious, in my opinion. The foie gras section on the menu has over 10 selections, but some of them make you go \"whaa...?\", like foie gras poutine and foie gras hamburger. The atmosphere is a lot like my favorite restaurant back home, which is not too fancy but just has really good food. The wine list was excellent with an extensive French selection. We started out with a bottle of Pouilly-Fuissé, but since the bottle we ordered was not available, the manager brought us out a Pommard he said was even better and was also less expensive, which was very nice. We started out with a plate of mixed pâté and some zucchini blossom tempura - the tempura was very light and pleasing. We moved on to two more delicious dishes, a tomato tartine and tarragon bison tongue. The tart was on this light fluffy pastry dough, and the bison tongue was extremely tasty. By that time we had moved on to a bottle of Old Vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape, also excellent. Our main course was the foie gras poutine - just had to do it - seared foie gras on top of fries, gravy, and cheese curds, and it was everything I thought it would be. I figured I was probably only going to have poutine once so it might was well be the most decadent. We finished things up with a dessert of maple churros, espresso and cognac. Afterwards the manager came by our table and brought us each a complimentary shot of Bushmills and drank it with us. It was just a really great experience.\n\nP.S. I read a quote about this place afterward that gave me a smile: \"No animal is safe from his kitchen\"
