What can I say, this is a happy place for me. I know walking in, it's going to be about fun food. Whether it's the divine milkshakes, to the over the top burger of your making. This location is very busy, but I prefer it to the others because of the spaciousness. Their burgers are good. Not on the level of Butterjoint, but still good. Better than BRGR, in my opinion. They come with the house chips. Custom creation burgers are where it's at, and fun to create with their varied buns, sauces, rubs, and toppings. A hooked up burger may cost you a pretty penny though, heads up. Milkshakes are a must! they have spiked and non-spiked versions. The salted caramel is perfect if you don't want a sweet concoction. The burnt almond torte is a riff on the famous Prantl's bakery dessert. Have also tried the crab burger, it was delicious, but it's got minimal texture. I hear the veggie burger is fantastic and can't wait to try that sometime.
