I'm Vietnamese so I've had a lot of experience with Vietnamese food. Been to pho Cao 2 times. The service here is very bad. Bot times I went with a couple buddies and there were maybe 10 ppl in the whole restaurant. It took about 30 mins to get our app, which was the nem cuon..it was so so nothing special, the one at com tam thuan kieu at Mekong plaza is probably the best in town. Then we ordered our pho, it was bland! I can smell the anise (way too much of it) but that's about it. I couldn't even taste the beef of the broth. I tried to fix it by adding more hoisin than I normally add and siracha, but no luck.  I then had to ask for fish sauce to give it some flavor. Now its more edible. It's pretty bad if I have to add fish sauce to my pho. Oh, I also had to ask for napkins, the waiter brought our food but no napkins....twice! One time for the app and then for the pho. I've also had the shaken beef there the first time visiting and the flavor is good, only complain with that is they cut the beef too small. Shaken beef should be about 1 inch cubes bite sized, so u get a beefier bite each time. And lastly, they have karaoke! That's great! But it's a Vietnamese restaurant, yet they don't have any Vietnamese karaoke. Only English karaoke. I find that very ironic.
