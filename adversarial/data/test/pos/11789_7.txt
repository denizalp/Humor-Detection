I had a lovely time at my recent trip to Le Petit.\n\nTo begin, I don't like pumpkin stuff, like, usually ever. But the gal sold me on their pumpkin steamer, which was made with their homemade pumpkin base. It was delicioussss. Not super sugary, and came served in this huge cup and saucer. It made me so happy. I would come back for that alone.\n\nI also had the chicken croissant and hopped on their wi-fi to do a little work. Le Petit is as close to an authentic Parisian cafe as Cleveland will ever get. The menu is creative and inspired and the interior reminds me of a street French bistro. The service is a bit slow, but I think its because its more of a neighborhood gathering spot. The service is interlaced with a lot of talking and hanging out, with a lot of folks who seem like regulars. I can see how that could effect the review of non-regulars.\n\nI would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in the area. They also have a delicious list of sweet and savory crepes, which my friend kept constantly raving about (she had the peaches & blueberry). Don't miss out on this cute little gem!
