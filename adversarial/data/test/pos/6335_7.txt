Unable to get a reservation, the S.O. and I snagged one of the cramped 2-tops in \"the lounge\" (bar area). I like the chillaxed vibe in the lounge but trying to juggle the bread basket, side plates, and stemware without knocking over one of the precious wineglasses was a bit of a challenge.  As luck would have it, a couple we knew walked in and we decided to join forces at the more spacious table for 4 tucked into the corner of the lounge--the best table in the bar area, IMHO.\n\nI loved, loved, loved my chilled zucchini soup which came garnished with sun-dried tomato pesto, croutons, and a drizzle of grassy e.v.o.o. This light refreshing starter was the perfect tonic on a hot summer's night. Next was a grilled sea bass filet and one plump, sweet scallop on a bed of lentils and spinach. The fish was fine but the scallop was damn near divine. My dining mates all enjoyed their meals (bibb salad, smoked salmon  starter, another zucc soup, 2 orders of short ribs, steak). And if you're a dessert person, don't miss out on their scrumptious bing cherry crumble.\n\nNota Bene has an extensive wine list with a multitude of options available by the 5-oz carafe which is great if you're a lightweight like me or you've got a split along the red and white divide. \n\nOur waitress was efficient, if a bit cold, but I think that's better than having servers who want to be your BFF.\n\nThe prices are reasonable for this calibre of restaurant ($10-24 starters, $19-$25 mains, 40 bucks and up for steaks) but if you have a show to catch at the Four Seasons, the pre-theater menu is a steal at $27 for two courses or $35 for three courses. You just have to get there before 6:30 on a performance night.
