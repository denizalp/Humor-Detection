I've only been here once for the bar and for their food for the very first time last night. Although, it is only a couple blocks away from our home. \n\nMy family and I decided to indulge so we went ahead and ordered rib eye's, T bone steak with lobsters and spinach artichoke dip for our appetizers.\n\nEverything was absolutely palatable. Our steaks were cooked perfectly the way we want it. The rib eyes came with baked potato and string beans; never mind the sides just focus on the main dish! (I'm not really big on baked potato and string beans) our meal also came with salads.\n\nI'm so glad that we came to this place after coming to find out that our favorite sushi spot closes early on Sunday's. \n\nMontana Meat Co. is open 24\/7 their prices are reasonable for the food you receive and they are generous on their portions.
