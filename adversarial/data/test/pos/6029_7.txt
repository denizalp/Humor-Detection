Super yummy sandwiches, sides, and a bakery to boot!  The place gets packed at lunch so come early or be prepared to wait a few minutes for service.  With that being said, they were very efficient with taking care of the influx of guests that were there at the same time I was.\n Overall, the location was very clean, employees nice, and the food was very fresh and tasty.  I had a roast beef sandwich with a side and a delicious fresh brewed iced tea.  They have free Wi-Fi to use while you're there as well.  If I'm back in the area I'll definitely stop my again.
