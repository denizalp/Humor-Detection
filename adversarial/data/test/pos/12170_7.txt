I normally give good reviews but I cannot if were to be subjective about this new opening. \n\nFor the first time, was below expectation.\n\nSecond time to give it a try to see the change,same expectation did not exceed or improve upon.\n\nReasons:\n\n1. Poor customer service, long waits both server to send order and receive dishes \n2. Loud atmosphere and staff unorganized\n3. Lack of interest in providing welcome to new guest tables\n4. Location wise, not well known and design layout unnecessary\n5. Unreasonable quantity size \n6. Quality: freshness level below average\n7. Pricing is off especially small selection choosing \n8. Fail to observe tables, no duty of care \n9. Slow pace, rushed at normal times when not busy\n10. Unwelcome greeting of guests
