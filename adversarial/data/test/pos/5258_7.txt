I don't agree with many of the lackluster (or worse) reviews of this property.  As others have mentioned, this was the Las Vegas Hilton up until January of this year, now it's known as the Las Vegas Hotel, or LVH.   I'd booked this hotel for 3 nights, primarily because it was one of the more inexpensive options of the larger and more well known Vegas properties (inexpensive being a relative term;  It was $152\/night on Thur., $115\/night on Fri. and $83\/night on Sat. with a special promotion), but also because it's connected to the Las Vegas Convention Center where I was attending a trade show. \n\nI've stayed at several other Vegas hotels in the past (MGM Grand, Alladin\/Planet Hollywood, Tropicana, Excalibur, etc.) and in my opinion, this hotel and the room itself ranked as good or better than all of those.  When I arrived, I was greeted by a bellman who asked if I needed assistance with my luggage (I didn't), another woman greeted me and held the entrance door open for me while another gentleman welcomed me to the Las Vegas Hotel and pointed me toward the check in desk. It did take about 5 minutes to get through the check in line, but the line moved steadily, and the check in personnel were great.\n\nBased on other reviews of this property, I was expecting to find an old, broken down hotel with poor service.  I didn't find that at all.  My room was actually larger than the one I had at the Excalibur during my last visit, it was well appointed, there was both wired and wireless Internet available ($13.99 for 24 hours), the room was clean and everything was in \"like new\" condition.  It was outfitted with a 40\" flat screen TV, updated and modern wall coverings, bedding, furniture, artwork and draperies and a good sized desk so I could get work done while here.  There was a safe provided in the room and boutique soaps and shampoos from Kudos Spa. \n\nThe only critical comments I'd make are that a few of the lighting fixtures in the lobby and elevator corridors, and the large \"LVH\" sign out front do make this place look a touch dated (1980's design and lots of brass), but those wouldn't take much to update, and outside of those items, and the fact that the main club looks a bit odd as it still has much of the decor and layout from the old, now defunct \"Star Trek Experience\" exhibit that was once located here, this hotel looks fairly modern and seems to be in good condition - certainly in better shape (and not as smokey and in some cases smelly) than many of the properties on the strip itself. \n\nI did notice a lack of food options at this hotel when compared to many other casinos in Vegas.  When I arrived, I was more than an hour later than I expected to be (thanks, American Airlines), and I had some work I needed to get done and a call I needed to take part in before meeting up with some business associates later in the day.   For this reason, I really only wanted to grab something quickly.  Unfortunately the options were limited.  They had all their regular \"sit-down and be served\" restaurants (Bennihana, Vince Neil's Cantina, TJ's Steakhouse, etc.) but when I went to the area that was mentioned in their signage for \"fast food\", I found only a Pizza Hut Express, Seattle's Best Coffee, and an ice cream stand.   I ended up going to their sports book area (the largest in Vegas, I believe) and grabbing something from the sports grill there.\n\nKnow that they charge extra if you wish to use the safe in the room, and though they have an offer where they'll give you a $5 food\/drink voucher or a $10 gaming voucher if you call and refuse room service for the day, you cannot apply that during the day of check in or the last 2 days of your stay.   Therefore, during my 4 day stay, I could only take advantage of that offer once.  It would've also been nice to have a coffee maker in the room, rather than having to go to the lobby each morning for a caffiene boost.\n\nIt should be noted that, while this hotel is more or less connected to the convention center and there is a monorail station here to get you to the strip quickly, it's fairly far off the strip itself.   In fact, I had a room that more or less faced the strip, and my view was of the back side of the Venetian, Wynn and Encore properties, all a fair distance away.\n\nIn all, I'd definitely stay here again.  I found the staff to be friendly, rooms well appointed, modern and in good condition and had absolutely no complaints about my time here.  This is especially true when considering the price of this hotel\/casino compared to many others in this city (excluding the off brand hotels\/motels and known dumps like Circus Circus and the Stratosphere).
