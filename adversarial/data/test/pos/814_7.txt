Bomboba is the B-O-M-B!\n\nI cannot believe that I have not written a review for Bomboba yet.  As I look at some of the other reviews, I see comments on the service being less than stellar... but I have never experienced anything less than excellent service here.\n\nIt can be so difficult to find a taro smoothie with custard pudding and Bomboba knocks it out of the park!  The durian smoothies are also fantastic.  \n\nEvery single time I have been here (which is adding up quickly), I have walked away with a big smile on my face and a deeee-licious drink that I have trouble pudding (pudding, get it?!) down.\n\nAnd they offer a gift card deal year round where you buy a $20 gift card and get a five dollar bonus... AND they have the punch\/stamp cards.  Every fourth or fifth drink is free if you play your cards right!\n\nMy favorite boba place in the entire Valley.\n\nI will be back... again and again and again. \n\n*****FIVE STARS****
