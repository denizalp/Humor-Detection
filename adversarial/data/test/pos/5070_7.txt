OK so l went again to KIWE and this time it was for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. Dinner was great no complains there the only issue that I have & I can't seem to shake off is the $18.00 Cake Surcharge that we had to pay on our bill after we spent a whole lot of $$$ in this joint.\n\nSo I have done my own calculation breakdown to try to justify this Surcharge\nStore Cake in Fridge while customers are eating------$5.00\nPlace Plates on Table while customers are waiting - $5.00\nPlace Forks & Spoons while customers are waiting - $5.00\nPlace 3 Candles on Birthday Cake-------------------------$3.00\nTotal-----------------------------------------------------------------$18.00\n\nInteresting isn't it?
