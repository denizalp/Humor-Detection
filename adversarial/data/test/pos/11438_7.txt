This has got to be my favorite hotel whenever I'm in Vegas.  I know it's not as fancy (or \"boojie\") as others but they've treated me very well and below are my reasons.\n\n1.  Affordable hotel prices.  I don't have to worry about giving one of my kidneys just to stay overnight.\n2.  Great for gambling.  They don't take my $40 in 5 minutes *cough* MGM Grand *cough*\n3.  So many late night places to eat whether you're only craving a pretzel or a full size pizza.\n4.  The bars are so laid back.\n5.  The rooms are clean and spacious enough that you won't feel cramped.\n6.  It's located right off the strip so everything is within walking distance.  For instance, the monorail is right across (MGM Grand) so you can go to hotels that are not walking distance.\n7.  Service staff is friendly, courteous and helpful.\n8.  NYE - Has a great spot to see the fireworks.\n9.  Members Program - A lot easier to accumulate points.\n10.Casino-Invited Guest Lounge - You can get free bottled water, sodas, tea and coffee while snack on pretzels, cookies and trail mix.  It's not located at one of their sister hotels unlike The Palazzo and Venetian.\n11.Essex Penthouse Suite - I was fortunate enough to stay here a while back ago and this place was simply amazing!  Master bedroom comes with bathroom so big, it's bigger than a studio apartment.
