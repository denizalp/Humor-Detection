Young and black, be prepared to feel discriminated against. I'm white, my best friend is black. We both walk in, and the general manager standing in front immediately asked my friend for her ID.\n\nNow. There's no problem being carded. We get carded all the time. What we do have a problem with is ONLY her being asked for an ID. Dave and Buster's age policy is under 18 must be accompanied by someone over 25. There's only a 4 year difference between us. Even if he thought she was under 18, there was no reason not to also card me to make sure I was the right age to accompany her. \n\nWhen someone gets carded in a group, you card the group. Especially if the only person you feel like carding is black and you explicitly tell their white friend they don't need their ID, but you'll look \"if it makes her feel better\". And then proceed to tell the 22 y\/o woman you just carded you're a \"pretty good judge of age\" trying to defend not carding her friend. Not to mention NONE of our other baby faced white friends who came in later got carded at all. When we expressed how rude it felt, we both felt the apology was pretty blown off and he threw us a couple $5 cards from the huge stack in his hand to get us out of his hair.
