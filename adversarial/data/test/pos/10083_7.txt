The two gentlemen behind the counter at 180 smoke are a joke and didn't even acknowledge the presence of other customers besides the ones standing directly in front of their face. Waited 10 mins without any \"I'll be with you in a minute\" courtesy . If you own and run a business it's on you to be professional even though most of the staff (and clientele for that matter) are probably unfamiliar with that word. So at the end of waiting for 10 minutes I thanked the two employees for their \"help\" and walked out. I'm happy to report that a couple of other customers followed me. Enjoy bankruptcy.
