There once was a Nader that craved delicious food one Saturday morning. On this particular Saturday morning, Nader was living in Tempe, close to Broadway and McClintock, and after much thought (and inquiry with his hungry girlfriend) he decided to go to Royal Taj for Indian buffet. \n\nNader's tummy rumbled with fierce fierceness the second he stepped in! He went in for a little bit of this and a little bit of that, filling his plate with a plethora of rich flavors! But then, right as he thought he chose all that he would choose on his visit to the buffet line, he noticed chicken curry. Nader knew right then that this Saturday was a special day! He had never tried Royal Taj's chicken curry before because it had never been out during previous visits. \n\nExcited, he rushed back to the table and filled his cheeks with all the wonderful dishes, making sure to save some of the curry for the naan. After his first bite of the curry, he smiled cheek to cheek! The curry was wonderful and actually a little bit spicy, with bone-in pieces of chicken for enormous amounts of flavor! \"Oh, how this food is amazing today!\" he said after a couple of plates! Nader was very pleased! Nader was also very full, and he vowed to eat that curry again! \n\nOn that particular Saturday, Nader left Royal Taj a better man. A better man because he now had a mission to not let Royal Taj go unnoticed when it came to East Valley Indian cuisine. But it is up to you, Yelp user, to go give it a try yourself. So go! Go and feast upon the glory that is Royal Taj!
