Friggin awesome...So what do you do when you are over buffet's and eating junk in Vegas? You eat at one of the \"FINE\" dining establishments in your hotel. And when they mean fine they mean FINE! This place is awesome and also gets you front of line status if you want to go to Tao nightclub.\n\nSince we had such a large party (8) we couldn't get a reservation until 1045. A little late for dinner....but its Vegas....I woke up at 5PM so it's not that late ;-)\n\nWe were seated and our server was very helpful in explaining the menu and the items on it and mentioning the special of the night. \n\nSo I had the 8oz wasabi encrusted filet mignon. BEST STEAK ever!!! I have eaten at most of the \"Fine\" steak houses in San Diego and one other steak house in Vegas but this one takes the cake. It was so tender and beautifully cooked (medium rare). My friends also had the special of the night (a 12oz Rib Eye) this was also very good and cooked perfectly. We also had the beef shabu shabu pot....it was good but I wish we could have tried the kobe beef...that would have been awesome. Either way I could have eaten the broth by itself. The other thing that stood out was the kobe beef carpaccio. EXCELLENT!! Marinated and cut exquisitely.\n\nAll in all the best restaurant I have eaten at so far in my 27 years.
