They broke my frames while installing the lenses and refused to reimburse me.  Apparently there is a sign posted in an obscure section of the store that says they are not liable for frames that were purchased somewhere else. The only possible way that you can see the sign is if you climbed over the glass counter.\n\nI think they tried to exploit the fact that I was young; I did not receive an apology and they did not work with me to remedy the situation. They practically hustled me out of the door!
