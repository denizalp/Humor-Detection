First (as always ;) duh) beer! I'll go for the beer alone!\n\nNext, apps. I had the pierogies, 2 potato 2 sauerkraut. 4 good pierogies!\n\nThey have a semi enclosed patio which in northeast Ohio is always nice to enjoy when weather permits. \n\nWhen I return with my wallet and more than $10 (thanks to my friend for picking up my slack) I'll be ordering a, what I'm sure will be, delicious German entree!\n\nProst!!
