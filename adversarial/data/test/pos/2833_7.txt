I love the 510. \n\nThe food is just great, it has a relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere, it's oaky and comfortable and just a damn fine place on 17th to chill and get quietly smashed amongst the 20-somethings. Awesome patio in the summertime. \n\nI met a local rockstar here and drank several tall boy Pilseners and chatted about everything and nothing at all. Good times brosef.
