Wasn't sure what I was walking into here because It comes across as a typical nightclub from outside. They even scan your face when they look at your ID. Whoa. The future!!! \n\nIt was super mellow when we walked in after dinner but the bartender was friendly and poured a stiff vodka soda. The venue inside is huge and has a little food counter service set up in the back. No clue what was being served because, vodka. \n\nMy group went straight to the outdoor area in the back. Tether ball, giant beer pong, four square. It's an adult playground!!! I could and will spend many many hours back here. \n\nI didn't realize until on the way out that inside has games too. I'm curious what this place is like when it's poppin' because I'm already a fan. \n\nI'm sure that I'll end up checking the indoor food scene out the next time I'm in. Why? Because, vodka.
