I love this foodcourt at the Venetian!!!\n\nI was able to order the perfect meal in all the right times while in Vegas.\n\nMy favorites were the Chicken Kale Salad @ $12.98.\n\nI ordered extra chicken at only $3!!!\n\nEating clean is a daily challenge, especially when you are traveling. \n\nThis place saved me by helping to get my daily need of proteins without the cost of room service.
