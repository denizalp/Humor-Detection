This Shell station is horrible.\n\n1) The bathrooms aren't inside, like Getgo's. They're outside and around this sketchy corner, filthy dirty with gang signs and cigarette butts littered on the floor.\n\n2) The store itself is tiny and cramped with many items out of stock and 3-4 people who work *one* register.\n\n3) The parking lot itself is pitted and dangerous, even by Pittsburgh Pothole standards.\n\n4) This place is ghetto. This is the place all of the thugs and gangsters come to get their Slim Jims and \"hang out\". People paid for things in nickles and pennies.\n\nThat was my first experience at the store. My second experience (months later -- I blame a lapse in memory) found me driving down Baum and thinking \"hey, I could use gas and my car is crazy dirty. I wonder how much that Shell place's car wash is? It won't be so bad if I never have to go inside the store.\" \n\nSo I google-texted real quick and called them. After 8 rings someone picked up the phone and mumbled at me. I cheerfully asked how much the car wash was.\n \n-\"We can't give that information over the phone\". \n--\"Wait, what!? Why not?\" \"I just want to know to compare it to Getgo's, which is $7\". -\"Sorry.\" \n--\"Well that's stupid; let the manager know I think he's an idiot.\" \n-\"Sure\". Click.\n\nSo come for the ebola laced bathroom, stay for the nihilistic attitudes!
