This place certainly has a great selection of healthy plants.  Their prices are fairly high, though, so I don't generally shop with them.  Today I was looking for a particular plant and they were not really friendly or helpful.  Hopefully on my next visit I will find more of what I am looking for - I am not too much into the self help situation.  I would prefer to have someone who works at the store make some suggestions and show me some possible plants I may wish to buy.  But I will be back!\n\nUpdate: After hearing from the business, I decided to go back again and am happy with the results.  I ended up buying 3 trees, delivered.  \n\nUpdate 2:  My wife, who is very observant, noticed they forgot to stake the trees as promised during the sale.  Not wanting to call them and have to set up an appointment whereupon I would be stuck at home waiting for them to return, we decided to stake them ourselves.  Honestly, for the price paid, I would just buy plants at Home Depot or Lowe's and save the money.  Too expensive for failed promises.  I will not buy from Moon Valley again.
