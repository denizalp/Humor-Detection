The first time my wife and I went here, we used a Groupon that stated \"worth of hotpot or shabu shabu for two or more people.\" Decent customer service and attended to our every requests, such as giving us sesame seed oil with salt.\n\nThe second time we went, we wanted to try their all-you-can eat special. We arrived at 8pm and our server told us they will close the kitchen at 8:30. Swish is open until 9pm. We decided it was not worth eating there, if we only had 30 minutes to order. So, technically they close at 8:30, due to the fact you can not order after 8:30.\n\nThe third and last time, we purchased a Groupon that stated \"worth of hotpot or shabu shabu for four or more people.\" Initially, we purchased that Groupon because we thought we were able to receive four people worth of shabu shabu. When we arrived, our server stated we needed four people in our party to redeem the coupon. Since it was only the two of us, we decided to try their all-you-can special. \n\nBefore our meal was brought out to us, we requested sesame seed oil with salt. Our server quickly said \"We don't have that here.\" We explained to him that we have received it before. Keep in mind, there were only two other people dining in, so they were not busy at all. We asked if he could check. He agreed, but we can see that he had an attitude. When he arrived back, he stated that they did not have sesame seed oil. We decided we were not going to deal with his attitude, so we talked to him and asked for the owner. We explained the situation to the owner and he responded back with \"So, what do you want me to do about it?\" We left after that and never came back.
