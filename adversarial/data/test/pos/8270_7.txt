What can you say about a 7-11 that hasn't been said before?  Not much really.  This location is fairly well stocked with items you would expect from a convenience store.  \n\nLate at night this location seems to be busier than most other areas, I chalk that up to the fact that this is located in a rather busy area.  I ended up finding everything and more than I needed.\n\nIt sometimes moves at a snail's pace in here, but that could be because of the clientele more so than the employees.
