Advice based on my experience:\n\n1- find the teachers that teach in a manner you understand and adjust your schedule to be in their classes, if possible\n2- read the chapter before class\n3- take notes and pay attention\n4-plan plenty of time to do homework the same day you went to class. There's plenty of homework. Do it all, a few times\n\nThe teachers aren't great about answering questions in an understandable way (example- some asks about question \"X\". The teacher responds \"well it's obviously not A or C so that leaves B or D and B is clearly the better answer of those two.  Any more questions?\" Umm...if we knew all of that was \"clear\" we wouldn't ask. \n\nI waited to take my school exam until a couple months after finishing school and I had time to really study and retake the exams  they give in the packet. I passed my second time. I did buy some of the study materials (flash cards, dictionary and the practice exams on CD) I found these helpful and essential to my learning. Highly recommend the CD!! I passed the state exams the first time.
