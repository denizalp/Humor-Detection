Best. Restaurant. In. Cleveland. This place has the best Mexican food in Cleveland. Anyone who says anything different should be put in a home for insane people. And the people that were already in that home should be put in a different home because they will realize how less insane they are than the guy who came in talking trash about VZAP. \n\nCarne con chile. Best plate of anything in the city.
