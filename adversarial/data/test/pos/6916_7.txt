Putting Edge has everything you have ever loved: Mini Golfing, Glow in the dark and GAMES!\n\nBeen going to this location for a while and I am glad to say that this is always fun every time I go! Super friendly staff, colourful decorations and tricky course holes. Registering and booking a tee time is incredibly easy, but beware that on the weekend it does get busy due to families, birthday parties and first dates.\n\nOnly recommendation I do have is to change the holes once in a while. I do remember playing each one and although I have a lot of fun, I hope they change the holes :)
