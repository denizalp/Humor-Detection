1905 is one of those restaurants that offers good food and friendly service.  On our recent visit I had the Crab ravioli with some veggies; think it was a daily special.  While I enjoyed the ravioli it seemed to just be OK, I guess I was expecting more flavor.  The meal came with a tossed salad and some fresh bread.    \n1905 is small and noisy.  There was a table of 12 that was very noisy.
