The pasta is really bad here- the burgers are great though! :) \n\nI had the 702 burger and it's a sweet burger with bacon and a fried egg. The service is okay, the guy was nice but they had him on so many tables it didn't seem far. Other waiters and waitress wouldn't seem as busy and didn't have as many.
