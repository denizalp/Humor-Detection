What in gods Jewish name is the problem with you people and the service of breakfast coming out sooner than later.\n\"Mama it's so sad they don't have thintastic bagels any more.\" What is with you people.... \nPLEASE PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER? \nWhere is our food?!!!! \nI ORDERED MY FOOD 25 minutes ago!!!\n\n\nYou people are so nice. AND there is always an issue here.\n\n\n\nBecause you \"no longer have thin bagels\" you have to cut the big ones down! WHAT?\nAND then, the deal is, you run out of Everything bagels in the morning, a \"fresh\" batch comes out and the \"bagels are to soft to cut,\" this was the issue with our breakfast this am.\n\nAnd then you there at Einstein Eastern, you seem to sell out of bagels when we go at least once a week- YOU SELL OUT OF BAGELS BY 9 AM...? WHY? Isn't this poor planning? WHO BREAKFAST BAGEL PLACE SELLS OUT OF BAGELS FOR BREAKFAST? \n\nThis is getting old Einstein Bagels. \nWhy do we keep going? \nMy 16 year old loves the thintastic egg white, mushroom and asparagus creation you serve... Plus, the service is lovely, minus the lack of food you run out of. \n\nYou are always apologetic and so kind... It's quite amazing. \nIs this pour management when a breakfast establishment runs out of Bagels? WHAT IS IT? \nIs it possible to correct it once and for all?
