This review is a reminder to myself (and to the world) that the service at Ruby Tuesday is NOT GOOD. And the food is mediocre. I'd say just avoid it for the service. \nFew days ago, Tiffany H and I were hanging out for almost the whole day, and we had planned to have dinner somewhere else in Concord. Our plans failed for unexpected reason. It was getting late and we were starving. We compromised, and settled on Ruby Tuesday, and it wasn't a life-changing experience.\n\nIt was my first time to eat at any Ruby Tuesday and I assure you it'll be the last time. I understand that this is a national casual dining restaurant chain, what I don't understand why the waitress had to be unfriendly and rude. That's one reason why I can't stand chain restaurants. \n\nOne and Half Yelps
