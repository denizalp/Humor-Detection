Food tasted really bad! I ordered the Tandoori chicken with Afghani rice. The rice tasted horrible..they had a weird taste to it. Chicken wasn't so bad..so I just ate the chicken and left the rice. Portions were small. My friend ordered a curry and some naan... The curry tasted good. However, Some of the stuff from the menu wasn't available. \n\nThe waiter had really dirty hands and fingernails which grossed me out. Also his uniform was visibly dirty. \nTo me appearance of the staff matters and it reflects the quality of the food and service!
