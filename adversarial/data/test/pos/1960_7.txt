Such an adorable place! Adorable because they have dancers!!!! Not cheesy back-up dancers, but real dancers, that do traditional dancing. I wish I could tell you exactly what it is, but I assume it's tied in with the culture. \n\nThe ladies came out a handful of times, in beautiful costumes (a different one each time!) and did dances for us. They were perfectly synced and entrancing to watch. I'd give the place lots of stars for this alone!\n\nBut let's get to the food. I always have to go with the traditional Pad Thai dish when I check a new place out. I love it loaded with veggies and shrimp. The dish was great! I asked for a touch of spice. While it really wasn't spicy at all, they did bring out extra spices which I was able to add for a little kick. \n\nI love that they have a bar too (I know, I seem like a lush!). But the place down the street doesn't have one and there's not a lot of great restaurant and bar options around here, so this is perfect! Plus, the menu is good! I was able to get a delicious glass of Malbec for $6.50. \n\nI'm so excited to make this my new spot, plus I get entertained as well!
