100% of Lush's products are vegan or vegetarian, the packaging is eco-conscientious, and this company is also cruelty-free (meaning they don't test their products on animals). While Lush is known for their bath bombs, you can find a plethora of personal care products here. From cosmetics to dry shampoo and even beard products for the dudes, Lush has it! The Lush I visited was in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops, and all three staff members on hand provided excellent customer service. They were super knowledgeable about their products and full of recommendations. I am now a devout fan of Lush!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #47
