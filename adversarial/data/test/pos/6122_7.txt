Worst place ever! First, this hotel changes you extra for everything ! You want a fridge? Extra you want an early check in? EXTRA! Late check out? extra! Not to mention room service is a rip off, not only do they add gratuity but they charge an extra 5$ service charge! So a 20$ meal ends up being 30$. I will never stay at this hotel again.
