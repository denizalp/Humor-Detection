My kids insisted on trying the Bacon Wrapped Deep Dish Pizza which surprisingly enough is not bad. Also, apparently everything is now part of the hot and ready so you can just stop in and pick up a pizza to go.\n\nWhile I still prefer other pizza places, this is a good option for a cheap and quick meal.
