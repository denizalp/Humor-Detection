Words can't describe our experience in the ER at Mayo.  Everyone from registration to respiratory was harmonious in making our visit quick and painless.  We were on vacation from CA about to return home while in the car our 3 year old starting gasping for air saying he couldn't breathe well.  We booked it to the ER at Mayo and they sure didn't disappoint.  The doctor on duty was one of the finest human beings on the face of the earth.  He personally got my son juice and stickers at the end of his ordeal.  In the midst of my panic with what was going on, I left my purse in the lobby and security brought it back to me with everything intact.  Just a great operation considering they don't really see many kids.
