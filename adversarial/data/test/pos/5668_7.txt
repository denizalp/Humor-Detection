The SLS, marketed as the \"foodie hotel,\" is situated on the former site of the Sahara.  You'll still find remnants of the Sahara here, as it appears that minimal construction was undertaken in rebranding the property.  In lieu of the massive dome that once signaled the entrance of the hotel, you'll now find a taxi queue encircling Philippe Starck's eye-catching sculpture called \"Saam.\"  But, scattered throughout the casino floor, you'll find slot machines that still bear the insignia and name of the Sahara.  And, the hotel towers remain largely the same as before, though they've been given a heavy-handed makeover.  For better or for worse, the past remains very much a part of this futuristic - or, at the very least, forward-thinking - hotel.\n\nThe interior of the casino is undeniably stunning, reflecting the hotel's efforts to awe guests with food, technology, and design.  The main entrance features illuminated floor panels that change color in waves.  That color is reflected across mirrors that lined the walls and ceiling of the entryway.  Above the casino bar is suspended a massive 3D screen on which various mind-boggling images are projected.  Rows of dangling, exposed light bulbs line the mirror-laden ceiling of the elevator area.  (When the line for elevators was massive, the security guard told us that there were no stairs to access the upper floors of the different towers.  Safety hazard?)  And, there's undoubtedly much more that I didn't have the chance to uncover. Given these details, it's not surprising that the hotel was giving away free selfie sticks for signing-up for their loyalty program; after all, only the most humble person could resist taking a selfie in one of the hotel's numerous mirrors.\n\nThe hotel rooms continue the themes found elsewhere throughout the hotel: trendy, retro, futuristic. (Yes, that's a paradox.)  Since the decor varies from room to room, tower to tower, the following is my assessment of our room, which was located in the World Tower.  The room itself was shockingly small but given the illusion of space by massive mirrors that could be illuminated with the touch of a button.  To maximize space, the door to the clean, modern bathroom was hingeless; rather than swinging inward, the door slid along a track, much like a pocket door.  The sole window featured old-school metallic Venetian blinds with a roller shade emblazoned with various images.  In our case, this meant staring at the faces of a crowd of people - interesting but slightly unsettling.  Smaller than traditional doubles, the beds in our room barely fit two people.  Rollaways were out of the question, as the front desk informed us that they would not fit in the room.  And, to be honest, they probably wouldn't.  While everything seemed modern, I wondered how the room would look in several years when tastes change.  The stainless steel legs of the desk, the wallpaper, and the mirrors already made the room seem more tacky \/ dated than retro.\n\nDespite its proximity to the MGM Festival Grounds, the SLS has little else going in its favor with regards to location.  The Encore, the nearest major resort (discounting Circus Circus and the Stratosphere), is approximately one mile on foot.  Although the monorail has a station at the SLS, it's probably not the best mode of transportation if traveling in groups given the cost per ride. Like other hotels on the Strip, however, self parking is free.  And, the lot is conveniently located next to the hotel, so walking in the heat can be kept to a minimum. \n\nThat being said, the one redeeming quality of the SLS could possible be the quantity of interesting restaurants sprinkled across the hotel grounds.  The highlight is probably Jose Andres' Bazaar Meat, which features similar items to its sister restaurants in Beverly Hills and South Beach but specializes in meat.  Other trendy chains, like 800 Degrees, Umami Burger, and Katsuya, have locations here as well.  All of these, however, bear one thing in common: the inflated Las Vegas price.  The selection of restaurants definitely bolsters the hotel's credentials, but doesn't necessarily make it more \"foodie\" than any of the other hotels on the Strip.\n\nBecause the SLS is neither the most luxurious hotel on the Strip nor the most affordable,  I would not recommend staying here for your next Vegas trip.  You can easily find better quality hotels at a similar, if not lower, price that have a more ideal location.  Resist the urge for selfies and free selfie sticks!
