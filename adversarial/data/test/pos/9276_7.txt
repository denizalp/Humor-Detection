This place is 2.5 stars, but feeling generous today, so rounded up! I've tried better since I am comparing this to NYC. The milk tea is really nothing special. I could not call it bad because I had worst but it was nothing to rave about. The only thing that different and unique is probably the size of the plastic cup. The popcorn chicken should be AVOIDED. It seem like the popcorn chicken is used to make a profit from high school student who lack money. So if you were coming to Easy Life Boba Tea, I will recommend a drink and stay away from the food!
