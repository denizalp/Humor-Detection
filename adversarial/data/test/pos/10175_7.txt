I don't think there's a yelp review on the food trucks lining Margaret Morrison Street on the Carnegie Mellon campus. If they can yelp the halal trucks in nyc, I can do the same for truck food at CMU.\n\nPros:\nCheap, but eaten daily, it adds up.\nAn inexpensive way to achieve dietary staples: \nmeat, fresh veggies, carbs\nThe lady that works there is eager to please.\nWonderful assortment of condiments and asian pop music.\n\nCons:\nFind a hair in my food EVERY time. But in confined cooking spaces, what else can you expect.\nThe food ache my stomach for about an hour after being eaten, but then my body gets over it and I feel like it was worth it.
