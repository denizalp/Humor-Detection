Stopped in for a quick cup of coffee before heading to the Barber Shop down the street. I was very impressed with this intimate coffee shop. Coffee was amazing and staff were extremely friendly. I hardly ever go out and dine on Roosevelt Row...but I will definitely return to this place often. Cheers***
