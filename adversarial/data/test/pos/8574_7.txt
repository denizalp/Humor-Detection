Popped in real quick to buy some ribbons for gifts. The store was empty and the cashier was taking her time because some other customer had to go back several times to get what he was looking for. After several minutes, a rushed manager opened another register to cash us out. Nice employees and store was organized. I also liked that they have a DISCOVER ATM. 3 stars for the employee who didn't ask for another employee to help and just waited for the slow customer.
