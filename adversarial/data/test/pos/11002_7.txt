What can I say that has not already been said, this park is open remodeled home to the most awesome fountain in the city. \n\nLots of events happen yearly here, its where the Pittsburgh marathon ends, home to the arts fest. It is easily accessible by foot, bicycle, car, stork, kayak and train. Ok maybe not train. It has great views of the North shore and Mount Washington. \n\nBladee Blah none of that even matters because right now there is a huge rubber ducky down there. As part of a visiting art exhibit, he is wise he is awesome, he is the star of Point State Park and he won't be there long. \n\nOh he has only been here a few nights but Imagine everything he gets to see! Ask him anything.... will the pirates keep winning? Will the Steelers ever start to win again? Did that swerving speed boat get out of the way before that coal barge hit it? How many kayaks peppered the river today? Go ahead make his day. He looks pretty cool through the fountain mist as well.
