Just left my eye appointment crying! Dr Peterson is an asshole. I have never been treated like that at any doctors office, let alone an optometrist. He was rude, unprofessional, insensitive, demeaning, and an impatient prick! He should be ashamed of himself. Unless you want to be insulted, and have the worst eye exam experience of your life. Stay the f away from that place!!!
