Service is great. The employees are very friendly and helpful.\n\nCheck in and you will get $1 off your order ...which you should drop in the tip jar because the staff is just amazing.\n\nI am just in love with their Ruben sandwich. The dressing  complements all the ingredients of the sandwich just perfectly. My mouth is just eager to take another bite after bite after bite. I am sure that there are other items on the menu that I would like but I will not risk giving up experiencing this euphoric feeling to adventure off. \n\nI do however try a different smoothie every time I stop into Presto. My favorites are the Berry good 4 u shake and the veggie goodness.
