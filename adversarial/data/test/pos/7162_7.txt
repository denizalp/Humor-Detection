If you are smart you will stay far far far away from this place.\n\nI transferred my son to this clinic because his old doctor was so far away from me, even though he was a fantastic doctor.\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.\n\nThe receptionist are rude to say the least.  The are ignorant.\n\nThe Executive Director Diana Noel is incompetent.  When I spoke to her she actually hung up on me telling me I was being loud and rude.  Trust me I wasn't and if I was she would know it...I am that kind of girl.\n\nNot only can I never get an appt for my son at a reasonable time but I have been told I should take my son out of school if I cared at all for his medical well being.\n\nEXCUSE ME???\n\nMy sons concern was never urgent and if it was I would have not waited to take him to a doctor so why would I pull my son out of school for a non urgent appt at exam time...\n\nNext I was told I have no business knowing anything about my sons medical needs .\n\nSTOP RIGHT THERE.\n\nMy son is the one and only thing I care about in this world and I will now and always fight until the bitter end and no as much as humanly possible about all that concerns him.\n\nIf he has a disease that was life threatening would you tell me the same thing???\n\nI will never again take my son to this clinic again I am transferring him back to the other doctor.\n\nSTAY AWAY FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
