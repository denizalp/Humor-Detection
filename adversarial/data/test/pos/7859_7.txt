This organization is a rouse!  I have lived in Las Vegas for several years and each and EVERY time. I have dealt with this company, no matter which location, it is the same thing. \n\nLack of follow up, the job requisitions are phoney!  Each location is a franchise and they literally pull the job postings off of other websites...Linked In, Careerbuilder, Monster, etc.\n\nIf you are smart, PLEASE do not waste your time.  Go to Aerotek, Adecco, etc. My associates, friends and colleagues have ALL had similar experiences.
