This is definitely worth it! But I'd recommend only doing it once and hitting all the buffets you wanted to try.\n\nI used the buffet of buffets pass during Thanksgiving weekend so the price was about $85 (including tax). And my boyfriend and I were able to do 4 buffets. Breakfast, lunch and dinner twice. Also, if you want to dine at Caesar's Palace or Rio Seafood Buffet it is an additional fee per visit ($15-30). But let me tell you, holiday price or not, it is worth it to pay for Cesar's palace. \n\nHere's a price break down of how I did it:\n\nBuffet of Buffet Pass:                  $85\nCaesar's Palace (Dinner):          $40ish\nTotal:                                          $125  (Tax inlcuded)\n\nPrice per Meal:\nDinner at Planet Hollywood:       $35.99 (Holiday Price)\nBreakfast at Paris:                      $23.99 (Regular Price - couldn't find holiday price)\nLunch at Rio:                              $38.99 (Holiday)\nDinner at Caesars Palace:         $68.99 (Holiday Price)\n\nTotal:                                          $167.96 (Not including tax about $12.60 = $180.56ish)\n\nYou save about $50 probably more if it weren't the holiday.\n\n\nA few tips:\n\n1. Schedule it right. You have 24 hours to use it. If you purchase it during dinner 6-8ish, you have the opportunity to have 2 dinners, the most expensive meals. Dinner, breakfast, lunch and dinner again.\n\n2. Space out the meals, go early during breakfast, so when you have lunch your not to full and by the time you have dinner, around 7-8 you should be hungry?\n\n3. Pace yourself. Don't overeat and indulge in the foods you really want to enjoy.Eat until your full but not to the point you have a food coma (unless its your last meal or you at at Bacchanal).\n\n4. DO dinner at BACCHANAL at CAESARS PALACE. It is WORTH IT!!!! The best buffet dining experience I have ever had. \n\n5. It's definitely something you should try once if you have time, because this requires a days time. Don't schedule anything that's time consuming within the 24 hours. \n  \n\nENJOY!
