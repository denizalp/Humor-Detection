I've lived here for just over a year and have had a good experience. Recently renewed my lease. The staff is responsive and it's generally a quiet community which is good for those who work early hours.  Occasionally there will be free tacos. \n\nGuest parking is limited, but you have the opportunity to reserve a second parking space for a small fee each month which is worth it if you enjoy entertaining.  \n\nThe apartments themselves are great and well maintained. Very new appliances and nice floors, counters, etc...  I have never had a woman back at my place who didn't compliment it immediately. Maybe it's the paint. Maybe I'm just good looking.  \n\nThe location is also a plus as food, shopping, bars are all very close by.  It's convenient. \n\nThe only thing I don't like is that you are charged for valet waste even if you don't use it. Leaving trash out side your door just attracts flies and I would rather just carry it down myself. But still charged.  Oh well, life goes on.  \n\nOverall, Camden is a nice place to live and I plan on continuing my stay here until my yacht is finished up and docked.
