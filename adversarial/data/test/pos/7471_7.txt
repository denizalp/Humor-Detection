Yelp says 3 stars is \"A-Ok\" and that's about how I feel here. \n\nIt's important to note I wrote a review about the Walnut street Pandora store awhile back, and in it, I mentioned this South Hills location. I've been here a handful of times, and never made a purchase because I was always treated a bit rudely. Nothing verbal, just not quickly helped even in an empty store (the cashiers had previously been more interested in their own conversation) and eyeballed a bit. After another trip to Walnut street today, I had shared my experience at South Hills with one of the cashiers and she was surprised that I drove all the way to Shadyside when I do in fact live in South Hills. She seemed as surprised at the bad service I've had at South Hills Pandora as I was when she told me the stores were owned by the same family. Hmmmm...\n\nI don't command special attention, I just want to be treated the way I'd treat a guest of my own. I think that's fair. Walnut street is outstanding. I'm no big spender, rich girl, or VIP, but you wouldn't know it from the service there; you'd think I was spending thousands.\n\nI returned home after shopping there today and realized I had to run to South Hills to return a dress I had not worn on my vacation and today was the last day to do so. I was going to Express, which is right by Pandora. I decided to give it a shot. I didn't need anything, but curiosity made me walk inside.\n\nMy previous complaint about South Hills had been that I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, when she goes in that retail store, you know the scene. Well this time, since I'd just went home and was counting on staying there, I had changed into sweat pants. I thought \"here we go...\" and laughed to myself a bit, and in I went. You know what? It was better! I was greeted warmly, with big smiles, I said I was just browsing, but was still treated nicely. So maybe the past few times I had just caught the wrong people, or the right ones on the wrong day perhaps. I'll still make the drive to Walnut street, but at least I know that it is possible to come to this store and be treated as a welcome guest.
