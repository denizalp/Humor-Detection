The food here is decent BUT the reason why I'm leaving 2 stars is because EVERY SINGLE TIME I order for delivery, the lady who takes my order does not speak good English AT ALL and there is always a communication barrier. It takes 20+ minutes to put in a simple delivery order. Insane! On top of that frustration, she gets upset with me because I make special requests (which are so simple btw) because I like my food prepared in a specific way and she seems to get overly irritated with me. Did I do something wrong by making a simple request of how I (the paying customer) likes to have my food prepared? I don't think so! She acts as if I'm difficult when in fact it's the other way around. \n\n\nHere's a solution: Put someone who speaks clear English to take delivery orders. \n\nThis is EXTREMELY frustrating and the next time I visit in person I will be addressing it with the owner or manager and if they don't acknowledge this as a valid concern then you lose me as a customer forever. Not that they care but I'm making it known in case they read this review. I actually placed a delivery order today and experienced the same problem AGAIN. I will no longer be ordering from here because I get tired of dealing with people who can't speak English clearly enough to communicate effectively. Especially when I am a paying customer. If it was free I wouldn't care. But I spend $30+ every time and I get tired of the communication barrier.\n\nHad to finally get that off my chest!
