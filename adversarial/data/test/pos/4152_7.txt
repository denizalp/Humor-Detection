On a recommendation from a friend, I parked my car here for 3 days during a short trip.  I parked in the covered parking area thinking I'd protect my car.  However, it rained while I was gone and when I returned my car had water spots all over it.....so much for covered parking.\n\nThe good news is that it was only $11 per day and I signed up for their frequent parking card that will allow me to earn a free day for every 5 days I park....cool.\n\nThe shuttle to\/from the airport is very convenient and the drivers are friendly and helpful.  They will pick you up at your car and drop you off at your car when you return.....that's pretty good service.  I like this place even though my car wasn't really covered.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%
