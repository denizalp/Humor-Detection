Phenomenal beer (and cider!) selection. However, you are constantly asked by the bartender if you know what you want if you have not yet ordered your first beer. After you decide on said beer with little to no help, you're scoffed at if the beer you order isn't unique or expensive enough for the totally cool bartenders taste. You wait five minutes for this all while feeling like an a-hole because that's how the bartender made you feel. \n\nFast forward $90 later between two people. You're sober. Yes, I realize the goal isn't to get plastered, but who doesn't love a nice buzz every now and again?! And at $45\/each, I better be buzzing pretty gosh darn good. For $90 you're better off buying a crap ton of PBR (because the goal is to be kewl and totes trendy, right?!,) and staying home with a few buddies. Even after paying out an astronomical tab for less than 8 beers, again, between two people plus a hefty tip, we still felt an air from our now server since the bartender didn't want anything to do with us. \n\nAll in all, if you want to be hip and grab a beer you've never heard of and hate yourself for ordering with every sip, go here. If you want to go to Melt with out the wait and want to Frogger across the street to get it, go here. If you want to spend a small fortune for a large disappointment, go here. \n\nObviously I won't be back. Drink responsibly and stay thirsty my friends. Trust me, you'll still be thirsty when you leave here.
