Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.\n\nI've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.\n\nI've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  \n\nThe showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.\n\nBut I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.\n\nEnjoy!  If you can.
