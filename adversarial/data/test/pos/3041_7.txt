This is a great place to go if you like to get really high.  High without drugs I mean.  The view is pretty good from here but not as good as the view from Paris since that is in the middle of the strip.  You have a view of a few casinos, golf courses and other misc. things I don't remember.  Compared to Paris there's more things going on up here than just a view.  There are some rides up there to get you even higher, places you can sit and a bigger area to walk around and view different parts of Vegas.  With my local discount it cost less than $10 for me, so I think that was pretty good.  \n\nThe end.
