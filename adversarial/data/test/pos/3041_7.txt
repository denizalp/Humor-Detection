Very bad experience. Rooms are nice but no water boiler, no tea or coffee.\nWe booked with breakfast included but was told we hadn't. Never mind it's the most simple breakfast ever where you only get to choose one item. Never been to a hostel let alone a hotel with such a minor choice and strict choice of breakfast. I strongly recommend not staying here and if already booked complain about the horrible so called breakfast selection and eat elsewhere at your own cost!!!!
