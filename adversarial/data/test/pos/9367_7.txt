Like so many people out there, I had purchased a Groupon for Angles Salon. It expired a number of months ago. No worries though. Alberta has a policy that any certificates you purchase you can still use the value you spent at the establishment. I guess they should say all establishments except for Angles Salon in Royal Oak. \n\nI called one day to book an appointment for a haircut. I ended up having to call back and cancel because I couldn't get into my Groupon account to print the certificate. When I told the receptionist my predicament, she told me that they have new owners who have decided that any expired Groupons can only be used towards products NOT services. WTF?? They can't do that. What a bunch of bullshit. The Groupon is valid towards ANYTHING at this place. They can't pick and choose what they want to accept the Groupon for. It's against the law.\n\nI contacted Groupon who said they would have Angles call me however I never heard from anyone. They obviously don't give a shit about their customers. I will never ever go to this place even though it's conveniently located across the street from me. The whole idea that management will not honor a certificate and basically changed the rules for it pisses me off. DO NOT GO HERE!!! Management sucks.
