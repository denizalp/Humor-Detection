This is a great hole in the wall family owned Mexican restaurant. I have not had a bad thing on the menu. Their street tacos are some of the best. You can choose the type of meat you want in them. You can even get all three in the combo different. The Torta is awesome and the burritos are mouth watering.\nService is great. It gets a little cramped waiting for your order because the place is really that small. The prices are good too. Sure there isn't a dollar menu but who needs one when the food is this good. Dollar menus are for places with horrible food.\nIt can get packed around lunch time so be warned. Calling you order in will save on time if you only have an hour for lunch.\nI have been going here for years and will keep coming back.
