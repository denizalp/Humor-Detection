We decided to try this place this past Friday.  Restaurant was clean when we came in and semi-busy.  This place fits in a different category of burger places for me.  Its definitely above a \"in and out burger\", but below a sit down place like Rehab burger in Scottsdale.  Our cashier was new and the manager had to come over and help her a couple of times.  Everyone was friendly.  The burger itself was ok.  That seemed to be the consensus around the table.  The burger meat seemed to be of a decent quality and the ingredients were ok, but I was not wowed.  I had the \"triple cheese\" stuff burger.  I would go back and give it another try if I was in the neighborhood.
