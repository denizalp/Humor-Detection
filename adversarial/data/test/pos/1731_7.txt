Stop yourself right now. Walk away quickly.\n\nMan, I have NEVER said that about a restaurant anywhere before. Like for the reals. Usually I can find one good thing to say about any place I go to, but this is the exception to the rule.\n\nThe interior of this place looks like an old Chili's...does anyone know if it used to be? The decor is failing and everything on the walls looked extremely dusty. It is run down in appearance and that was my first red flag.\n\nWe waited at our table for a good 7-8 minutes before we were even approached for a drink order and even then, we were told that he would be right back to get our drink order. Did I mention the place was not busy? There had to have been a max of three other tables that were seated.\n\nWe then waited 25 minutes for our food to be delivered once we were able to order...not sure what was going on there...but when the food arrived, I knew immediately that I was going to be in for a long night of bathroom runs if we stayed. I ordered a combo plate with a mini bean burrito and a cheese enchilada. My boyfriend had a chile relleno.\n\nI choked down a few bites of rice and beans because the enchilada was out of the question after I precariously tried a morsel of it.\n\nThen after very clearly pushing our plates to the edge of the table to signify we were done, ten minutes passes. Our server didn't even deliver our food and never stopped by to make sure everything was ok. I finally had to flag down a busser and ask if he could send over our server so we can pay. Another server came over and took our credit card for us and we were able to pay and get the heck outta there.\n\nWill not be back and no amount of coercing or bribery would work. As feared, the bathroom and I became fast friends after this meal.
