This is such a great park!  From all their giant bbq grills, the lake, the choo choo train for the weetots, a splashpad, a carousel, a playground complete with squeaky swings, et cetera.  You can even fish for rainbow trout here although I can't imagine it would be easy.  There's so much to do for everyone!  Not your cup of tea?  It's also a great farming spot if you play Pokémon GO.  I'm talking Pokéstop galore with lots of lures, the intermediate area has two or three Pokégyms, and Dratinis are here [so farm until you get Dragonairs and Dragonites].\n\nThis place is huge. There are numerous walkways, plentiful shading, and great for photoshoots.  All in all, Desert Breeze is a decent park.
