This place has always been a decent restaurant.  I mean if you wanna meet Ozzie \"the wizard of Oz\" Newsome or see Big Boy for Easter then its about the best place ever. \n\nHowever, with that being said when i was young until now theres only one constant left.  Thats my aunt, and i mainly go here to see her and her boss that looks like a coalminer.  \n\nThe service if I am with my aunt is always stellar.  We talk and enjoy quick jokes between us.  However, when my aunt is not there my service varies.  I ordered a turkey rueben on my last visit and ended up with a corned beef rueben.  Thankfully i didnt have to pay for it.  The turkey was like carved turkey, most times that would be something to have with gravy not covered in sauerkraut. The meat also i think would have been best served as lunchmeat style turkey.  I dont know if they have that in the refrigerator in the back, but at least have an employee hijack it from the deli across the street dressed in the big boy costume if you dont have it, geez.\n\nHowever, the rest of the service was alright.  The bill was a bit pricey, running me close to $35 dollars for my cousin and i to eat.  If i was a hillbilly then maybe the idea of having my cousin eat with me as a date would be something else, but hes a guy and we had two smaller portions with a desert.
