We had a very nice time last Saturday night at Giuseppe's on 28th. \n\nThis is a very, very small restaurant, that seats only twenty or so patrons.  We arrived early and waited for about forty five minutes or so for our seats in the rear, near the kitchen.  This was actually a good place, since we had no one sitting next to us and all the other seats were on top of each other, elbow to elbow. \n\nGiuseppe's may seem like a one man show because the owner Rich is woking both ends of the house, but we believe there were three others working in the kitchen.  \n\nWe started with Antipasto for $10.95, and then ordered our normal baseline meal of Chicken Breast Parmigiana for $14.95 and the Pasta Bolognese Ragu with a side of Meatballs and Sausage for $16.95, plus the $4.00 up charge.  We also had two soft drinks, which seemed expensive at $3.00 each. \n\nThe food was very good for what they call: \"Phoenix's Favorite Local Italian Kitchen!\"  I know they've taken some heat for being on the Food Network and Guy Fieri's show \"Diners, Drive-In and Dives\".  But this is nothing more then a good local Italian place.  It's not gourmet, but neither are the restaurants on the show Three Star Michelin either.   Our meal ran $61.92 including taxes, but before Tip.\n\nWe enjoyed ourselves and will be back.\n\nEnjoy!
