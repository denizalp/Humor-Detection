We come here all the time!  Lots of late night coffee and pie runs!  This is my designated eat breakfast anytime place to go.  The service is usually fine, food has always been good and love the selection of pies.  A pretty good mix of characters frequent this location and if you like to people watch you are in for a chuckle now and then.  The waitresses have always been friendly and one used to drive my wife crazy because she was overly friendly to me.  I loved it, we could order same type of pie and mine would be double the size with a wink after serving.  Coffee is always fresh and ready to go.  The cooks nail breakfast all day, every day....then again I akways get breakfast.  I like the 2-2-2 as perfect size without making you feel miserable to finish everything.  If you remember the bands Cranberries or Sixpence, you will hear the song \"Kiss Me\" or Cranberries \"Linger\" if you are sitting at least an hour.  We argue who is who every time and have to look it up.  As this is close to our house, we will continue to come.  Only complaint I notice more and more about this location is some of the workers reek of smoking weed.  It was almost toxic checking out one night and can't understand why they'd let the potheads be the last person you meet as your leaving this place.
