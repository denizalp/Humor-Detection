Apparently the owners name is matt. He came to my home, basically got my carpet wet, walked over my tile and left.even after confronting matt he just nodded his head. I luckly purchased a groupon and groupon refunded my money fully due to all of the issues. I will post the pictures on how he left my house. This guy truley disgust me with his level of integraty and knowing how to keep and make clients...I'm turning this over to bbb. Hopefully this jerk goes out of buisness. I am truley sickened!
