Love SC Gas Prices\n\nDue to a different tax structure, gas in SC is some of the lowest in the nation.  Had lunch down the street and filled up while I was here and made use of their inside facilities.  \n\nClean, well organized and generally very friendly people.Regular was $2.079 as compared to $2.43 here in Cornelius.\n\nNot sure why this listing is shown as MOVED of CLOSED becauue it was definately open today and busy.
