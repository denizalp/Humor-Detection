This was my nightmare home repair experience.  Everything I asked about was a $200 issue, including a toilet flapper replacement.  I ended up buying the $10 flapper myself and putting it in in about 5 minutes. I think the man who came thought I was someone who would just fearfully tell him to do $1000 in repairs.  These are like the car repair crooks you always hear about. I wasted $35 on the coupon but it would have been much worse if I had let that guy touch anything in my house.
