Just very tasty Korean dishes here. Bibimbop, jap chae, savory short ribs, and plenty of refillable free app plates (I can never remember what the proper\nKorean word for them is). It's not as cheap as I'd love, and the restaurant... well its in a grocery store so ambience isn't the order of the day but the food is quite tasty.
