We have had Andersen H&C for several years now and they are Horrible!  Almost every time they have come out to do their annual HVAC cleaning, within 24 hours usually, something quits working.  It almost seems like they purposely are doing it.  Sometimes this goes on for several visits and despite it being their fault to begin with invariably we will get a bill for the damage they did to the unit.  I don't think a year has gone by that their 'technicians' haven't screwed something up, and then the next tech will tell us what the first tech did wrong... It has been most frustrating, and we are now scared that every time they come out we don't know what will malfunction next.  Thankfully they haven't killed us yet with carbon monoxide poisoning or blown up the whole house since the heating part is gas.  Andersen put the unit in when our townhouse was built in 2008 and the builder strongly encouraged us to buy  Andersen's annual 'tune up' pkg.  It was also suppose to prolong the warranty, but every time they have 'left something off' or 'didn't reconnect', lastly it was 'the motherboard' but within two days the unit stopped working again...  We will probably go with Morris Jenkins or Brothers HVAC next, unless someone else gives us a good reference...  Who do you recommend?\n\nKG
