In the best of times, I would rate Bell Morrison highly. These are the worst of times.  I recently renewed my one-year lease. Lo and behold, within weeks a major construction project materialized.  Building management omitted to mention this irksome development before I brought pen to paper. Further, they declined to provide a monetary adjustment.  The good news: my alarm is now unnecessary because at precisely 7am the construction crew begins work. The bad news: piercing loud noise a mere 100 feet away (think the high-pitched warning pulse of a front-end loader in reverse or the bone jarring thrust of a pile driver) continues throughout the day. I suspect this project will be completed at the end of 2014.  You will be best served avoiding this location until then. Given what I learned of management's philosophy in the response to my request for relief, you may be best served avoiding Bell Morrison altogether.
