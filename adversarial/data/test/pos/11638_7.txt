Poutine Lafleur makes a good honest, traditional poutine. The tourists can have La Banquise, Patati Patata and what have you but if you're looking for a blue collar, authentic representation of the real thing, this is the place. You must go here if you're looking for the classic caisse croute experience. \n\nYes, it's situated in a slummy part of town but the locals will vouch that Lafleur's makes a quality product. Ask the greasy teenagers. The welfare moms. They're all lining up here on Saturday afternoon for their fix.\n\nWhat makes this poutine so good? The fries aren't great, it's the typical soft, greasy fresh-cut fry that populates caisse croutes all over Montreal. Just a little bit of crispiness but that's the style. Next up, the gravy, it's got a good chicken base with a bit of bbq seasoning to spice things up. The temperature is on point too, just hot enough to melt the curds but not so much to detract away from the entire experience. Finally, the curds. Squeaky fresh. Bountiful. I wish all poutine purveyors were this generous with their cheese. \n\nThe steamies are just EHHHH. It's not the main attraction and it knows that. \n\nPoutine is a lot like life: lots of starch, a wee bit greasy and hot at times and one part cheese.
