Located in Summerlin (west of the 15, off the 215).  I used to hate AYCE places - until I came to 808.  I stopped by here on my latest trip to the Ninth Island (Vegas), based upon my yf Lisa S' review (from Vegas).  I also wanted to support my Hawaiian bruddahs.  Lisa S' review was spot on with 4 Stars.\n\nAs opposed to the food laying out like most AYCE places, they make the food to order.  At $26.95 and $3 for a large Japanese beer or $1 sake during HH, its a good deal.  My friend and I ordered the following from the app menu:  Ahi and he'e (tako) poke; garlic chicken; salmon kama (no hamachi kama that night); tako karaage; fried smelt and miso black cod.  From the sushi menu we ordered kani; salmon skin handroll; unagi handroll; soft shell crab handroll and two futomaki rolls (Maui and Da Hawaiian - she ordered these not me - lol). \n\nOverall, the appetizers were very good.  The ahi poke was fresh and flavorful.  The only thing I would change was adding more limu.  The he'e (tako) version was, eh, so-so.  It needed more shoyu and limu.  The garlic chicken was as advertised - nice and garlicky and not greasy.  The salmon kama was fresh and silky as this part of the fish should be.  The he'e karaage melted in your mouth!  The he'e was so fresh.  The fried smelt were nice and crunchy - Kind of like anchovies, but bigger.  But the best of all was the miso black cod.  OMFG - Broke Da Mouth!  It was buttery smooth and oh so fresh!  I wanted to order more, but I abstained because I didn't want to ruin my tastebuds.\n\nThe sushi was pretty good too w\/ the exception of the rolls.  The kani was ok for what it was.  I should have known it was fake crab.  The rolls were for primarily for my friend so, I only had a bite.  They were not to my liking - I guess I am old school and I have not fallen for the sushi roll craze.  The hand rolls were fresh, huge and creative.  The salmon skin was nice and crunchy.  The unagi came w\/ avocado (I have never had it this way). The avocado gave it a creamy finish.  The soft shell crab came w\/ a salad made from the crab meat - How creative!  It was very good.\n\nSince I ate most of the apps, hand rolls and drank most of the beer, I didn't have dessert.   My friend didn't have as much, so she ordered the banzai bowl - vanilla ice cream w\/ a small apple turnover and chocolate topping.  The other options are vanilla and green tea ice cream or 3 flavors of frozen mochi.  She really liked the dessert.  \n\nShaka to my bruddahs for good food, that is made to order and AYCE.  It was Da Kine!
