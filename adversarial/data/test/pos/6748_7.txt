Came here with a group of 5. Parking was easy, and the place was pretty empty for lunch on a Saturday, so that was good for us...since we were starving. \n\nWalked in, told the host we had 5 and was pointed to a table for 4. (They didn't lead us there....just pointed) but no problem... we grabbed a chair from the table next to the one we were assigned to, sat down and began to order. The food was just OK, 3 star quality even for a AYCE sushi place at about $22 a person. The service was slow, they had plenty of servers though. About 45 minutes into lunch....a server came to my friend who sat at the end of the table as he was eating...told him to STAND UP because \"we need your chair\". First response from my friend was complying... then he looked around....there were PLENTY of empty tables! So he asked....why my chair? There's a lot of chairs....so the server responded by saying \"what if other people come? They will need that chair\" let me repeat.... they had plenty of empty tables!! And the worst part is not that my friend was still eating his food when he was told to stand up....the worst part os that the group who the server planned to give the chair to only had 3 people...so they didn't even need the chair! \n\nLol....will not return....
