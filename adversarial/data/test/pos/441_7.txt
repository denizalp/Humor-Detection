I loved the Springbank Pet Hospital. I even liked the staff at their Resort What I did not like is the condition of my dog when I received him back.  I brought my Chi-pin to their resort bathed, clean, and in good health. What i received: \nsores just below his nose, sores on his ear tips, nervous, not the vibrant personality I left with them. It'll take him about a week to get past whatever he went through but I guarantee it won't happen again. \n\nTheir Receptionist Debra was less than professional and should pay more attention to how she speaks to customers.  I was treated when I came in not knowing about their rule for paying with a credit card.( If i knew that I would have prepaid for my dog's stay) I don't like Debra telling me to watch how i speak to her as if I snapped at her when I did nothing to deserve her behavior towards me. If you have a good relationship with your pet, have relatives that could watch them while you're gone, please do that before you take them to the resort. \nThe handlers and care staff were nice but their front office person really needs to get some training and learn this isn't a warehouse mentality, I am not a warehouse worker, I'm a customer. I was told they put one of their own dogs in with mine into his crate to see if that was comforting, I don't like that idea, I don't know their dog. \n\nI called to complain about Debra, and i received excuses back from their upper management. They offered some compensation in the form of daycare but I would not take my dog there again. I was highly disappointed in that portion of Springbank. \n\nI was appalled that Debra can speak to customers any way she chooses and not be reprimanded for that ridiculous behavior. I will not even now go to the hospital as to avoid her again.   I'm sorry it had to be that way. It's my opinion and I'll not retract it
