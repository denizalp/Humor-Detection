This place is awesome for locals and tourists alike.  They change the set up every season\/major holiday.  \n\nRight now they have their Fall arrangement with pumpkins, a scarecrow, 2 willow trees, a barn with a water wheel, a variety of flowers, large pinecones dangling from the ceiling, and a bridge you can walk over with water shooting over your head.  \n\nSometimes they have a live band playing near the scarecrow.  \n\nIt's free and definitely a place you'd want to bring a camera and take lots and lots of pictures.
