This is still the best breakfast bet at the Wynn. We got a smoothie, a green juice and steel cut oats to go for our car ride home and everything was fresh and healthy. Just what I needed! There aren't very many healthy options while you are in Vegas so this is a gem when you are in need of something healthy in the morning!
