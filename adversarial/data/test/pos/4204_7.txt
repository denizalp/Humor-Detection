Boba in a food court? Why isn't this more popular?!\nName is weird, apparently it's an attempt to highlight that they also serve nuts for snacking- boiled peanuts (regular and Cajun style), and some others, for $3\/each (didn't ask for portion size) or 4\/$10. Weird.\n\nThe drinks are good-sized, priced average: about $5\/each.\nThey have boba and jellys to add to milk teas, smoothies, and milkshakes.\n\nTried a honeydew that was super fake-tasting with way too much artificial sweetener- almost tasted too tart, like it had Green Apple in it or something. \nThe peach milk tea was solid- lighter flavor, not too sweet, good portion of boba that was nice and soft.
