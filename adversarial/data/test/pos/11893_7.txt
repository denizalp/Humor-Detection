If I could give this place no stars, I would. Save yourself sanity and money by NEVER living or let alone checking this place out. Management is by far the dumbest and most irritable people to deal with. Living here for going on 5 months I have had nothing but trouble with management. They will make up LIES and give you notices all the time. I am a young 20 year old but always have respect for people around me but somehow I am constantly making noise and have \"heavy traffic\" going through my apartment. First off, I never knew it was an issue having a FRIEND or couple of friends come over to MY HOUSE also never knew having someone over possibly ONCE a week was a crime or \"heavy traffic\" these people are rude and very incompetent. Idiots. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. one last thing, for what you pay you definitely don't get your monies worth. Very overpriced and the utilities are shit.
