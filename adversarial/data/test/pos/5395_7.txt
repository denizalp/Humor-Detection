This Shell station opened shop across the street from the Esso with the most consistently lowest prices in the area. First thought, why would you do that, the rest of the stations in the area were milking all the cash they could out of us. \n\nWith that began the gas war zone that is Vaughan. Previously \"bargain\" gas stations in the area were merely fractions of a cent cheaper than their big name competition, now they are 3-5 cents cheaper. Granted it doesn't hurt that the price of a barrel of oil has plummeted lately.
