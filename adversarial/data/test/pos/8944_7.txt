Oh, no...Chef Mina, why did you remove your delicious Lobster Corn Dogs from your menu? We returned for lunch with high hopes of once again dining on some Lobster Corn Dogs, great Black Angus burgers and knocking back a couple of cold brews.  Instead, we found that the Lobster Rolls have been replaced by Lobster Fritters.\n\nOur \"crack\" service team, Juan and Miguel, assured us that the fritters were a nice change to the menu, popular, and tasted really good. But, we weren't the only ones who asked for the corn dogs. Our slight disappointment quickly changed as we sloshed down our Kronenbourg beers and dug into our perfectly cooked, hand patted, hand crafted 1\/2 pound burgers. I ordered the 1842 Burger which was a 1\/2 pound of juicy beefiness topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli. My husband chose The Champ that was a behemoth with smoked Gouda, American cheese (NOT your typical Kraft slice), crisp thick strips of Applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce and special sauce. Both burgers were served between toasted brioche buns in a seemingly bottomless basket of BBQ French fries.  \n\nWe enjoyed our return dine as it confirmed the versatility or range of Chef Mina's talent.  He is able to take a simple comfort food like hamburger and transform it into a gastropub delight. Pub 1842 is a comfortable dining atmosphere complete with a full bar, a wide selection of global beers on tap and in bottles and multiple flat-screen televisions tuned into various sports events.
