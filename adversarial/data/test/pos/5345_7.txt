I might give them another try after a kind hand written note, a refund, and a welcoming offer to try them again, on them.  \n\nThis is Excellent customer service!!\n\n\nMy First Experience..\nIf there is such a thing as over greeting, this place accomplished it! It felt almost overwhelming walking in through the door. \n\nThe Food really wasn't that great! Esp for what you're getting. The drinks were the best part even though they were small and incredibly sweet. Our waitress must have had an off day, because she was short and I'm not talking about height.\n\nThe grits were edible but only because I was really hungry when I showed up. The garlic potatoes weren't even edible. I don't usually spit anything back out of my mouth, but this was horrible. My friend said the fish taco was ok, but nothing to rave about. \n\n\nOur Order..\n\nCOLDWATER FARMS CHEESE GRITS 4.75\n\nGARLIC ROST√è POTATOES WITH TERIYAKI GLAZE 4.75\n\nFish Tacos - my friend ordered\n\nDrinks..\n\nMOJARITA House blanco tequila, agave nectar, fresh lime mint, fresh-squeezed sour mix 8\n\nPINEAPPLE MARGARITA House-infused pineapple tequila, fresh-squeezed sour mix, triple sec 9
