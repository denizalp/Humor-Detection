I'm so smitten with NBC. These cakes are heavenly. Super moist, the best frosting (not too sweet & not too much). Every flavor I've tried has been amazing. CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHIP (my personal favorite), CARROT CAKE, MARBLE and RED VELVET are among my top choices. \n\n\nOutstanding customer service. Always friendly and every order is double checked. Great for gifts or just because you feel like indulging your sweet tooth. Order online to customize your cake. Super cute ideas for just about every occasion.
