If you want a fun, beautiful atmosphere, this is a good place. But if you also want decent food and reasonable value for your money - do not go to Cibo. I have been several times, and if you stick to bread\/pasta based things you will get enough to eat, although it is bland and uninspired. The rare tuna salad at lunch is a portion of tuna the size of one of those pink erasers you used in school along with 6 green beans and perhaps 1\/3 cup of arugula. No evidence of the grape\/olive salsa. Cost $18. Ridiculous!
