I am no longer a Yelp Virgin! First review, perhaps my good friend AJD is rubbing off on me, I'll shower later to fix that! Okay, the SeaLife Aquarium is IN A MALL! What? Did someone get lost? I enjoyed it thoroughly! With the space provided, the crowds that were there on a Saturday afternoon, and the Price (listed at the door of $18 per adult, $12 per child up to 12yo, more on that in a sec) I wasnt sure I'd like it. The displays were awesome, the fish were beautiful, the rays and sharks were bad-ass, and the company was great too! SeaWorld is a long drive, the 90 minutes it took me to get to Tempe from Tucson was well worth the time. No, its not SeaWorld, or a major city like Boston's Aquarium, but for our little piece of the sun we call Arizona, it was worth my time, and money....back to that...Get your flippin smartphone out of your pocket or wrench it from your childs hands....and book online...you save $6 per adult and $4 per child, takes 5 minutes while you are in line (10 if you are smartphone challenged as I am) and save some money, help the good causes the Sealife aquarium backs, and enjoy a few hours in a place that Arizona is lucky to have. First review....go easy on me!
