We used this company for our move this past January after seeing their great reviews on Yelp and at that time, they had a great deal going on through Yelp. The pricing was fair and making the reservation was painless but one of our two movers was unprofessional and not overly friendly. He was using chewing tobacco while working and I found a used pile of chew in our stairwell in the complex we were moving out of. Luckily it wasn't on carpet but I still found it disgusting. In addition, when we got to our new place, he walked out onto the balcony and spit off our third floor into the courtyard while attempted to pretend he was checking out the view. While the price was fair, they were on time and worked quickly, and didn't break anything, I can't say I would hire them again. Sorry.
