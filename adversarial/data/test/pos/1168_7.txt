Love fancy crap! oohhh so shiny!\n\nLast year I bought a Lady DIOR patent leather purse (WYNN stores) in purple...the lady gave a hard sell by shoving 13 large wallets and a few small wallets in the purse and then asking me what exactly are you hauling in your purse.  With that I had no choice but to indulge and purchase this purse!\n\nThis year (2010) I went into the store (Caesars Palace) to get something.  I met a very funny sales person named Jeff, who ever so nicely pointed out to me that I came in looking at sunglasses but had since added to that by pointing out several wallets with the quote \" You started looking at sunglasses the rest of this is just you!\"  Of course I had to ask if he could make me a deal on the sunglasses and the wallet (did I mention I had already been drinking, cause I know DIOR doesn't do deals).  To this Jeff said \"I can't make you a deal on this stuff, if it was called JEFF I'd make you a great deal, but who wants a JEFF!\"....again with that I was sold!  I walked out with the matching wallet to my purse in purple.\n\nThe best part is that Jeff didn't sell me a bill of goods, he told me this wallet would fit beautifully fit in my purse (it did!), it would hold my cell phone (it did!), and my lip gloss (it did!), and my money ( again, it did!).
