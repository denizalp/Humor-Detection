I was walking west on King to an appointment and was famished. I was trying to be good, so though McDonald's, Pizza Hut and Tim Horton's were calling my name, I kept walking in search of a healthier mom and pop option. Alas, none appeared. \n\nFinally, when I was near fainting, I pulled into La Prep. I had their soup of the day, minestrone and a pot pie. A bit of a random order for 3pm... a definite lesson in not skipping lunch. \n\nThe place is very clean, teetering on sterile and pretty boring, but well run with decent options. I think their specialties are their sandwiches and salads, but they just didn't sing to me.
