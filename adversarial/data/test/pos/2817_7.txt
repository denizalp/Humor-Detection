A great pastry is a clear reminder of how beautiful our earth is!...see what I did there Lore D.?\n\nLa Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Caf√© is not the best French Bakery in town, but not in the lower half either.  Overall, I'd give them a strong 3 Stars...3 very strong Stars.\n\nThe Croque Madame is my favorite I've had here--and good enough to bring me back.  Too many other items fail to impress including their Kouign Amann, Quiches, Palmiers, and Tartines.  They are all run-of-the-mill varieties here, but certainly not bad.\n\nI keep meaning to try a Pain au Chocolat while I'm in. They look tasty! We've always enjoyed good service while we here and I love the relaxed setting.  The space is clean and laid out in a serene manner that invites you to take your time sipping a cup of coffee, reading a newspaper (on your smart phone of course,) and tearing off buttery pieces of a croissant.
