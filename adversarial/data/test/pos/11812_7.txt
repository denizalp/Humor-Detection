Craving some Greek food, I ordered the gyro and jalapeno hummus for lunch through a food delivery app last week. The gyro was unexpectedly gigantic which was both good and bad. Good because you get a lot for what you pay for. (Half was enough to get me full.) Bad because they stuffed so much meat in there that I had to take out about 25% of it just so I could hold it in my hands and start eating. (Sorry no photos because I was too busy figuring out how to eat the gyro.) The meat was savory though! I also enjoyed the jalapeno hummus. I liked that it was just a bit spicy but not too overwhelming for hummus.
