The legendary New York street food vendor has finally arrived in Las Vegas. Rejoice!\n\nEven if you've never tried their food, The Halal Guys should require no introduction if you follow social media at all. You must've had a friend or two post photos or rave about this restaurant, whether it's the original food cart in NYC or one of the new outposts in their wave of expansion. I was able to experience them in California and I was excited to have a vastly more accessible location at last (although it requires a U-turn or two lefts if you're approaching from the highway side).\n\nI arrived at the start of typical dinner rush hours, so I was surprised that there was hardly any wait. After standing in front of a powerful A\/C machine, briefly perusing one of the simplest menus anywhere, and waiting for my friends to arrive and get their own glance at the menu, I walked to the front of the line, ordered my food and sped my way to the cashier.\n\nCombo Platter ($9.99 for regular size): about half of the aluminum tray had a salad mix, the other half had orange rice (with turmeric and perhaps other spices) that my friends mistook visually for cheese, and the rice was covered equally with chicken and gyro. Quick note: that legendary lamb gyro isn't even available at the original Halal Guys anymore (per multiple reviews), so the beef meat here is presumably the same that you'll get at any of their locations.\n\nAfter you sit down (I don't see why you'd wait to sink your teeth into this), the right play is to grab white and red sauce bottles, then drench your food with white sauce. Maybe move the pita bread wedges out of the way first, but just get that rich creamy stuff into every bite. Then you might try just a touch of the spicy red sauce, which is legitimately spicy. Squeeze gently!\n\nI must admit that I wasn't really picking up all the flavors at first, and perhaps there's a basis for that. The chicken was far more coarsely chopped here than at my first occasion, so there's probably less caramelization. Plus, peering into the open kitchen, I didn't see chicken on the grill or gyro on the vertical rotisserie, so perhaps the meats just get cooked up in batches and then left to linger. One of the employees was working on a huge pot of rice though, so there's that. And of course the baklava would be baked ahead of time (this portion seemed small so I skipped it).\n\nHowever, I did save leftovers (all but the most ravenously hungry should have some), and I ended up devouring them late that evening. Maybe my palate just wasn't right earlier, and aside from still not picking up all of the nuances from my first time (especially in the sauce and the rice) and realizing that the meat was a bit dry, I was happy enough that my leftovers didn't live to see the dawn of another day.\n\nFalafel ($1.99 for 2 pc): a little bit of false advertisement considering that the sign says $1 (presumably for 1 ball). Of all the fried chickpea balls that I've had, this is among the better ones in flavor. However, I wasn't that impressed with the texture because was a little mushy\/dense inside and not all that crunchy on the outside. This is probably because they'd been fried long before they were served, just like the other proteins.\n\nBaba Ghanouj ($4.99 for a decently sized tub and a pita): nice spiced flavor with surprising smokiness, plus discernible vegetable texture. The tub comes straight from the fridge, so it's cold. I suggest waiting for it to warm up enough to lose the cold temperature's numbing effect on the taste buds. Although it was my friend's order, I'd be amiss not to mention that Stefany V was right to recommend this side dish.\n\nI'm a little disappointed overall, but I'm sure that I'll be back sooner or later when I get a craving for The Halal Guys. Hopefully it will hit all the right notes without forcing me to wait for hours.
