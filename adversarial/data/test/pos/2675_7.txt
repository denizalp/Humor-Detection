Came here last night for a night cap after an amazing dinner at China Grill. Its a cool spot to grab a drink, the service totally sucks but since it was pretty much our only option for late night drinks at Mandalay bay. \n$12 bucks for a Chopin and water but i guess that's pretty normal for the Strip. I mean i guess ill go back if  I'm in the same predicament of no where else to go but it wouldn't be my 1st choice.
