As quick service Mexican food goes, Federico's hits the spot. What I find ironic is when this was a KFC, I would see cockroaches crawling all over the drive-through when I was nearby, and now that its a \"hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint\" its infinitely cleaner. \n\nLate night drunken carne asada fries? Check!\n\nTasty adobada burrito? Check! \n\nRolled tacos smothered in guac and cheese? You know it!\n\nPrices are reasonable, quality is consistent and good, and flavor is never lacking
