Let me put this out before I even start:  Vegas has absolutely nothing on Los Angeles when it comes to KBBQ.  There, I said it!\n\nThis review was for my attempt to eat at Hwaro on May 28, 2016.\n\nNow, for my rating:  the one star rating is for not allowing single diners (i.e., people who dines\/eats out alone).   To think I showered knowing I was going for KBBQ,  drove all the way from Henderson only to find out:... - me can no eat !
