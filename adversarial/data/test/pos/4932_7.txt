This is one of the places I spent most of my childhood - one year even going 19 times with my family through out the summer. I actually counted. You'd think I'd get tired of all the rides, annnnd you'd be right. I ended up taking a 4 year break and tried again a couple weeks ago. This place is still just as fun as I remember it!\n\nNow Im terrified of heights, but I make sure I hit up every ride possible so I can tell my friends that I aint scared of nothing!\nLeviathon and Behemoth really were worth the hype - they were pretty damn awesome. I enjoy going down big hills so these were right up my alley. But there are all kinds of rides for the kids, adults, avid roller coaster riders and the bed wetters. \n\nThe prices are good - especially with a seasons pass. Makes coming here totally worth it, as going twice pretty much is the cost of the pass. So if you're thinking of coming more than once, do it that way. You'll need to save all the money you can in order to win some prices and afford the cost of food at this place. \n\nThe funnel cake is a huge favourite here, and they are extremely good. But, I tend to go for the icecream cookie which is huge and delicious! I can't get enough of it. You can find it only by the Vortex- unsure why as it's unbelievable- but I'll treck my @ss around the park to get there for a cookie any day. (Look at review below with the pictures, and you'll see the cookie almost eating up the guys face)\n\nDo NOT go on weekends or long weekends if you can help it. I thought I was being a genius by choosing to go on a day after a holiday, thinking everyone went on the holiday, but I was so wrong. But they do have fast-tracking now, which I think is really smart. I'll be paying extra for that gem next time (and with my luck, so will everyone else)\n\nBottom line - great fun for everyone at a great entrance price. But let's face it, this place is really only up against Marine Land, so it knows it can get away with a lot. I'm a fan either way.
