Here's all you need to say about this place:  My buddy (a Marine in full dress blues) was turned away because he was \"too drunk.\"  This dude coulda put a .50 cal downrange two miles to a target, but was too drunk for a strip club?  Skanks for supporting our troops!  \n\nGO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND PARTY HARD!
