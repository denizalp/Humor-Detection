ACO has something for everyone, from the baller ($12K package that includes helo drop) to the groupon which I used for the $120 package. It's an adults only affair so no kids, but women are more than welcome.\n\nGo to the way back of the parking lot and look for the military surplus vehicle. You walk in and immediately impressed by the d√©cor, full fledged lounge with leather couches a pool table, decommissioned military equipment. It has this rock and roll vibe, but since you register online and come early you'll really enjoy the environment. Weekends are busy which mean you don't get hands on instruction, it's very group oriented and I suggest being at the front. \n\nThe staff besides front house are all ex spec ops so you are in good hands when it comes to leading and training. The do a jack rabbit start jumping you into the scenario right away, gear up and train and your off. I suggest keeping things in a backpack as the personal storage area is nonexistent.  I also recommend you upgrade guns as the lights come in handy (only 4 of the 13 houses are lit) and being team leader or even clearing a room is much easier with the flash and red dot scope. I suggest you be in good physical condition as getting in and out of windows is required. Easy on the trigger and the grip, the adrenaline will have you gripping out and you'll end up pumped. Follow instructions, comm with your team and team leader, you probably only need 2-3 mags. The goggles are not ideal and the helmet is funky, but the only real danger you are in is being shot by friendlies. The chest harness\/mag carrier is pretty universal, so basically it's gonna hang loose on you. Don't wear too many layers, yes getting hit hurts, but no need for full protection, unless your don't like the people on your team as zombies don't shoot back. Honestly wear bright colors as you will show up better in pictures. The photog is good for up-close, but gets washed in distance and detail. \n\nPrice to me was a little high, but you do get a cool experience, it's like paint ball, but less messy. I wish there was more zombies and that the rooms were bigger, some spaces were small. The cache of weapons, meth lab, cure vials were also minimal and we didn't really have that clear an objective, if I could place a recovery team scenario or hostage retrieval that would be cool as there was a terrorist overlay. I got to lead, secure the rear, kick a door in, kill some zombies and search vehicles, while others were hesitant (lack of lights made clearing dark rooms difficult). I had 4 mags and almost went through 3 being on full auto most of the time. There was some confusion on reloading, but I wished was communicated to my team before we went out as only I was prepared at the front. Someone got infected because they had to change mid entry and didn't plan with his team. \n\nOnly 1 bathroom at the end, water and energy drinks for purchase as well as pictures. It's worth it if split among the group as phones are no allowed outside the lobby, that includes body cams like go pros. It's a great concept where you can certainly have a lot of fun, but there are limitations. It's similar to paintball with more roll playing versus competition. If you are looking for something new or different ACO is for you. We had current military and even they loved it, despite them doing real deal live exercises, this is fun.
