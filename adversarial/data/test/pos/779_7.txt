After getting some business done at the Fedex-Kinko's next door, I headed to Golden Spoon to grab some Froyo.\n\nIt was a totally spontaneous decision and when I make those types of decisions it's usually not in my best interests....so I was having second thoughts about indulging in some Foyo Awesomeness.....then I saw the huge Nutritional Info board explaining the calories and other key facts of the Froyo.....88 Calories per serving huh?  hmm....I asked the girl how many servings was in a Small.....she said about 1.....so, I said how about the Regular?  She said about 2.5.....I did the Math quickly and decided that 216 or so Calories isn't going to kill me......so I ordered a Cookies & Cream w\/Raspberry Cheesecake no toppings.\n\nAfter the first bite I was very pleased with myself for justifying this to myself....ha!  I enjoyed every last bite!\n\nWill I return?  Ummm....of course!
