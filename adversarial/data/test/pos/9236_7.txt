Graze had always been good about dogs. Yesterday, we were seated, with dogs, at the edge of the patio (dogs were actually off the patio). We were approached by a manager who stated that they recently changed their policy due to \"staff with allergies\" and \"risks\". Bummer guys. Lots of other spots (DLUX, Merchant, etc) still totally okay with dogs outside. \n\nScratch this one off the list of Madison's dog friendly establishments.
