The bartenders always know how make interesting shots!  Plus they have their \"Slay the dragon\" t-shirt for drinking all the beers.  Yeah...the shirt itself isn't amazing, but I'm down for any drinking contest.\n\nI love the cranky old man owner.  He's a Man U fan so he's even better!  Go Red Devils!
