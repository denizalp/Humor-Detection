Why is this theater so cold? I swear it is 50 degrees in here no matter what time of year it is. Boo on needing to bundle up to go to the movies.\n\nBut other than that I like it. I like that it's not in a casino or mall and you just waltz right up to the theater (feels very normal to non-Vegas native like me). I like that it's Regal and that that company has joined the ranks of many other companies by having a spy program disguised as a \"loyalty card.\" I see your tricks, Regal, and as long as you give me a $2 small popcorn on Tuesdays, I don't care.\n\nI also think that this theater has movies for longer than most in the area. I have been able to catch movies that came out months prior at this place when other theaters give up on the not-so-well-received. (Review within a review: Anna Karenina stunk. Leo Tolstoy is rolling in his grave. I would like my $9 back, Keira Knightly, or actually better yet, why don't you take my $9 and enroll in an acting class or maybe read the novel your character is based upon. Whew; I'm glad that's off my chest.)\n\nIt is a pretty clean theater and you can't beat its parking and its neighbor to the right, Body Heat Yoga.
