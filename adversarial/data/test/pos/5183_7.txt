You ever read your old reviews and wonder what the heck were you thinking?\n\nAnyway, I figure a star bump for this place is in order. I do enjoy going here to pick up banchan, random snacks, and the after 8pm half price gimbap. I wish this place was closer to my house actually. I like to eat the banchan as soon as possible because you never really know how long it's good for.\n\nI also like to look through whatever Korean snacks they have. I recently discovered yuzu and black pepper shrimp chips. I guess it boils down to lemon pepper flavoring, which is A-OK with me! Plus, although Costco carries pretty good dried seaweed, the selection at Greenland has better flavor.
