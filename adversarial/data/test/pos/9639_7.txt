I swear, my usual order tasted different from the spring mountain location. Different owners,...is that why? The boba was also not as good...was a bit hard and didn't have much of that honey flavor inside. \n\nGreat vibe and service though. But I will be heading back over to SM for my kungfu boba fix.
