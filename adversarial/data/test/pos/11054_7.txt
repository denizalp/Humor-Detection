I am currently a Manta Ray. I float around like a carpet or an oversized kite on the ocean floor. But before I was a Manta Ray, I'd come here for sandwiches, often. Remember, I'm talking about Pre-Manta. ;)\n\nFirst hand experience:\n\nI've been to this Primanti's maybe 7 times, including the first time I was ever playing shows in Pitt, and then the next 2-3 times because I didn't know any better, and then I've taken some friends here including a barbie doll girl not too long ago. None of my guests were any more impressed by it than myself, so I'm sticking with a 4 star, sorry all.\n\nTheir food is just... it is good, it's just not amazing... I dunno. i don't get it. I do like it but there is something missing. It's a Pitt legend though. Don't ask them what the best seller is. The Cheesesteak is the #2 seller. Always get an egg on top of your sandwich.\n\nAn update on this to tell you that, while this isn't the friendliest place in the world, there is a kind of charm to their abrasiveness that makes you feel like you're at home. They don't seem to like you using the bathroom (it's in a nightspot, go figure). The great thing is that they are genuinely 24 hours and will make you anything at any time of day.\n\nI have to admit the food is a bit more bland than other local Pittsburghese specialties along similar lines (like Peppi's). Having said that, I would recommend that everyone and their mother try eating there at least once, for three reasons. (1) It's the most famous eatery in Pitt. (2) A lot of people swear by it, so you might love it even though I don't. And (3) there is absolutely nothing in the world I have ever tried, that is similar to Primanti's sandwiches. They are, for lack of a better phrase, an entity unto themselves.\n\nAnother sticking point I have is the price. It's just too high for what it is and how busy they are. But then again, you do get a whole ton of food.\n\nThe only thing weirder than Primanti Bros, is that there is a Primanti Bros outside Pittsburgh. There are actually several, and they're all... yes, you guessed it. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I know, I know, that sounds weird. But look at it this way. If you had to pick ten large cities in America that did not have their own \"local\" flavour of food, Ft. Laud might be one of them, right? And if you had to guess where all the hot Italians in Pittsburgh go when they want to lay on a beach and get warm, you might guess Ft. Laud right? Well, perhaps that explains it then. Except that Primanti Bros is now not only the famous late night eatery in Pittsburgh.... it is also the most famous in Ft. Laud!\n\nPlus the Ft Laud version has better scenery in all sorts of ways. To be honest Pittsburgh girls are probably as gorgeous as South Florida girls (probably the same girls on vacation?), but the difference is they're wearing different outfits because the weather is different... you might say. And the Ft Laud location is literally across from the beach. The very same beach that, on my first ever visit to Ft. Laud, I had an intimate encounter on, with a lovely girl. I got a ticket from the police during that encounter, but not for making love... for leaving the car parked illegally at 3am while going down onto the beach to do aforementioned activity. Sorry, was that too much information?\n\nHowever, whereas in Pittsburgh I'd say, give it a try (the sandwich, not the sex, although that could be fun too)... if you're in Ft. Laud, do yourself a favour... drive to Miami, and try what is undeniably the best Cuban food in the United States... See my top lists for more on that.\n\nPS\nI don't think Primanti's Permeate's my fave sandwiches list. For that reason I'm renaming it Permeate's. And if you come in here when all the Pitt frat boys are drunk, then it's more like P*nis's. Or perhas Pre-Pubescent's. In terms of levels of maturity anyway.\n\nStill, it's better than The O - Original Hot Dog Shop. Don't read my review for that place. Trust me.
