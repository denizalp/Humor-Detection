Rental date: 11 November 2010\nI've been prettty loyal customer to Advantage RAC (formerly known as US RAC) in my years visiting and living in Las Vegas, which is why this really bugs me. \n\nI reserved an \"Intermediate\" size car through Travelocity, but when I got to the counter, the dude told me I would get a Toyota Corolla. I told him that on my reservation it said that I would get a Mazda 6 or equal. He rebutted by saying that Travelocity's site is wrong in showing that, and that their \"Mid-size\"  is a Corolla. **NOTE: I really wish that the travel sites and the RAC places would all use a standard description for car sizes.** That said, he repeated himself countless times, and I kept rebutting that I'm supposed to get a Mazda 6.( And besides, I was supposed to get a free upgrade anyways, to which the dude replied, \"you already got the upgrade because you reserved a compact\". WRONG!!! I reserved an intermediate.)\nI finally said that I would call Travelocity to rectify this situation. To which, he repeated, for the umpteenth time, that their \"mid-size\" is a Corolla and their \"Standard\" size is a Mazda6. \nHe twice went to the back office during my call to Travelocity, and mentioned that he \"could\" give me a Mazda 6, but that the only one they had, had GPS and that he couldn't give me that one. Finally, about 20 minutes into our \"standoff\", he says that a Mazda6 just became available from the \"back lot\". ??????WHAAAAAT?????? That was such cow excrement!! He was just trying to get me to submit into paying extra for the GPS. (I don't think they even have a \"back lot\") He then suddenly became very courteous and apologetic, which by then I really couldn't give a you-know-what about.\nSo after about thirty minutes of bantering, I finally drove off in a MAZDA 6, STEAMING!!!\n\nNOTE TO IGI: Learn how to treat customers or go work in a parking booth.
