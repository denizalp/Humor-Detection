Came here for a nice French dinner and was not disappointed. The wine list, although very good, is a bit pricey. We opted to bring our own nice bottle of wine and pay the $20 corkage. The least expensive red was $50.  The size of the appetizers was amazing. Not your 2 bites kind of app. I got the Pheasant Connsomme. Not a sharing dish. So good, I wouldn't want to share anyway. The presentation was surprising and pure puff happiness. My husband had the shellfish and grits. He was in love. And luckily he shared his grits....so yummy. My dinner was the Bordeaux Duck. Most things are cooked here using the Sous Vide method. So things stay moist and are perfectly medium rare. My husband had the steak. Perfect. Stuffed to the gills, we still made room for the frozen chocolate dessert. Frozen with liquid nitrogen very slowly, then broken. The acidic fruit pairs wonderfully. Worth every penny. Will definitely be back.
