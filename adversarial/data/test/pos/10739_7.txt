They are way over priced. Took way too long to bring our food. The chicken soup was disappointing and didn't have allot of stuff in it.. mainly broth.\n\nThe food was just not that special. For a sandwich that was $20 I expected it to be loaded and perfect, but it was just your average deli counter sandwich.\n\n The servers were attentive and seemingly friendly and kept apologizing about the wait. I don't understand what took so long.  It was not worth it and I will not be back.
