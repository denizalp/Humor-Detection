Do not be fooled by the charm the owners try to give off. Insider tip, the owner pays under the table and off the books. Or at least did for a known period. In fact the wage was under the minimum and has been reported to IRS. The service the time I ate there was horrible and quite frankly rude. Upon discussing with an employee at the time, I came to find that management wasn't too friendly. The kitchen was dirty. The main chef didn't wash hands after smoke breaks. The dim sum was reheated, pay attention to the skin on items your next visit. I highly recommend you avoid this place until the IRS and SNHD deal with them. Attached is a photo of their most recent inspections, showing the times they closed for violations. If you look at the violations, some are over 30 in one visit. 30 food health violations. Don't risk going here until they resolve everything. And you can read all the reports on the SNHD website. They've been shut down more times than I would imagine. Get these horrible restaurants out of our valley or to clean up. \n\nBack pay filed, IRS notified, SNHD notified. All statements of fact to argument and documented for my protection. Anti-SLAPP Law\nNEV. REV. STAT. §§ 41.635 - 41.670 (1993). \n\nPLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES CHANGS WE WANT GOOD DIM SUM AND YOU CAN POTENTIALLY OFFER IT.
