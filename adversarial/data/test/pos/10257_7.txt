OMG - FUN - Fun - fUn!!\n\nWhat you should know - is some of their \"pods\" have a fully staffed\/stocked bar and if you buy your ticket for the \"bar car\" before 6:00pm you get a better price.  Even Groupon couldn't match the before 6 pricing and since the ride takes about 35 minutes to go around completely - you can easily drink 3 cocktails - if you're like us Honey Badgers!!  \n\nTIP: Make sure you hit a restroom before you board!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.vegas.com\/attractions\/on-the-strip\/high-roller-las-vegas\/\n\nIt's located at the east end of the LINQ Promenade - easily accessed if you're walking.  \n\nWhat a spectacular view! I recommend going at night - although at some point on a return visit - I want to do it during the day so I can see those beautiful mountains to the west!\n\nWe had a BLAST!! You couldn't even tell it was moving. Music played and we took pictures and really enjoyed ourselves!!\n\nIn classic attraction style - the exit filters you through a gift shop.  Prior to entering the POD you get your picture taken by a pro. You view them at the end before the gift shop and there wasn't any pressure to buy them. We did - because they were awesome and we were making memories!!\n\nI will do it again!!
