The Ben:  This is my steakhouse when I'm in Las Vegas. Why?  Well, I usually stay in the Palazzo, but they have some pretty amazing steaks.  They start you off with these fresh out of the oven dinner rolls that you can never get enough of, but watch out that you don't fill up on it.  The steaks are worth skipping some bread for.  I always go with the aged prime ribeye on the bone.   It never disappoints and this time since there is a ban of foie gras in Cali I opted to try it for the first time as a topper.  Please don't mock me for never trying the foie, well I can you can, but as a Yelper\/foodie I had to try it for my street cred.  I thought it was okay, I just I'm not as much as a foodie as everybody else.  It was just some extra fat for my steak.  I would recommend the banana cream pie for dessert, it was amazing!  Bravo!\n\nThe Bad:  Only thing I would say it that you will be having a slow dinner.  I think we were there for a few hours.\n\nThe Ben:  Get the ribeye, pie and prepare for they long night of eating.
