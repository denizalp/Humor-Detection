PROS:\n- tacos were like a meal. Big portions.\n- service was friendly and kind\n\n\nCONS\n- everything has cilantro in it.\n- drinks were TERRIBLE. I would never drink there again; I'd just eat and run across to Spirithouse for real alcohol.  Pre-mixed margarita that was like two sips and way too sweet.\n- SPICY AF.  Only one tacos had the word \"spicy\" next to it, so I just didn't order that one. I THOUGHT I WOULD DIE and my tolerance is medium.  OMG.\n- way too loud. Loudest restaurant of all time.\n- hot, no a\/c? \n- \n\nI didn't use the restroom so I can't comment on that like I normally like to :)\n\nSo even though there are way more cons than pros, the concept was interesting enough that I'd try again.  Still prefer La Carnita, which I get isn't as \"authentic\" but I do love their tacos, what can I say....but better food than Macho.
