I come to Cleveland about 5 times a year to play at the House Of Blues and I like to pop in to your restaurant and enjoy the food which has always been good.\n\nBUT your staff is fucking horrible your hostess to night called me and IDIOT and laughed at us. She was in a bad mood since the minute we got to your restaurant and she even gave a dirty look when she was out back smoking cigarettes! \n\nI travel the world doing what I do for a living and I have never ever been treated the I was today the hostess doesn't not belong in the restaurant business I will never eat your restaurant again nor will I recommend it to all of my fellow musicians that we tour with
