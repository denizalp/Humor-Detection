Being one of my top five airports to arrive-depart( Long Island MacArthur Airport being #1 ), McCarran International Airport rocks!\n\n1- Free WiFi\n2- Slot machines are front and center (if you didn't lose your money at the casino, are you hoping for the last big win?? Silly person)\n3-The various Starbucks are large and in charge\n4- Bathrooms are everywhere\n5- Very close to the strip\n\nNow #5 is a biggie. If you grab a shuttle, you could be in your hotel room within the hour.\n\nThe air conditioned monorail will whisk you away to your destination. The airport has a small, hometown feel. Walking around and seeing the various stores for last minute shopping makes this airport a nice destination. Lots of airline choices, hopefully you have a direct flight.\n\nI enjoy people watching, lots of bachelor parties folks I'm seeing in August. The temperature is 110+ degrees, and thats at night! \n\nEnjoy your time folks, lots of fun to be had in this town. The airport is easy breezy once your here.
