Summary: Cox HATES their customers more than you could ever imagine. In their little customer service cubicles they have little cartoons of customers hanging from ropes or burning alive on bonfires.\n\nI only have them for internet. \n\nAfter becoming a customer they started to call my house twice a month to get me to sign up for phone and cable TV. I told them not to call back - add me to their Do Not Call list, but they would not stop calling.\n\nIf you have had a landline home phone you have surely gotten those dead calls, phone rings - you answer - but there's nobody there? Those are dialing machines from telemarketers trying to match your \"Hello?\" with an available telemarketer. I was getting lots of them from Cox, and their main number would be on the caller ID. So I started calling them right back demanding to know who was calling my number and hanging up on me after I answered. The customer service rep would research my bill - up to date, so it must have been from the marketing department. Faking ignorance I asked why they had employees that would call and hang-up on me, that I maybe did that when I was in 3rd grade but outgrew playing with the phone.\n\nSo I started returning all their calls demanding to know why they kept ringing my phone then hanging up, I told them this was sick stalking\/harassing behavior and needed to stop. These calls persisted. So I finally got connected to the marketing manager and told me he would take me off their telemarketer list. Next week the calls went from 2-3 a month to once a day calls. So I called back, this time with a loud and angry voice and told them I would report them to the Maricopa County Sheriff Dept if I got one more call, I had asked them repeatedly to stop and all it accomplished was to increase the harassment. The marketing manager laughed at me and told me he would personally delete my number from their database. The calls stopped.\n\nA week later I called them to update my info and gave them a phony phone number so they cannot call me now for any reason.\n\n\nIf there is any way for you to avoid being a Cox customer I would recommend not doing business with them.\n\nAlso, I get junk mail three times a month.  So I cut them up and fit them into my payment envelope. Hopefully it is so overweight that the post office collects for the overage.\n\nThey decided to add \"inside wire insurance\" to my bill without asking. Check your bill. I rent this apartment and I'll be damned if I am going to pay insurance on my landlord's wiring. Besides, the only people who have access to cable wiring to damage it in the first place are Cox or qwest employees!\n\nthis is a horrid company! They treat their customers with tremendous disrespect and deceit.  Cox truly hates their customers.\n\nUpdate : wouldn't most of you want to only pay for the channels you really watch, not the 75 other ones you're totally not interested in? Well there is a way: 1. Call Cox and tell them to shut off your cable service. 2. Install a decent TV antenna, 3. Get Netflix service and order your favorite TV shows on DVD since they come out soon after the season ends or watch online with a Roku box via your TV. Same shows as cable but a HUGE discount in price. Much better picture quality, no rude animated banner ads, no screaming Billy Mays ads to suffer through, no cable outages. No 3am infomercials. Imagine your house totally free of raunchy cable programming and paying for 75 channels without anything decent to watch. You will need about 10mbps high speed internet service. Take a bite out of cable, their prices are a crime!
