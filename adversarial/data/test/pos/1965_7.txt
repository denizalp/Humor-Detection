ZERO STARS!!!\nI ordered (and was charged for) an order of chicken fries with ranch sauce, a hamburger meal, and a vanilla ice coffee. \n\nthe hamburger was correct, I'll give them that. The fries were cold. I got an EMPTY chicken fry box, no ranch sauce, and the \"vanilla ice coffee\" was a chocolate milk. \nI could understand if they were busy and messed the order up because of a rush, but I was the only one in the drive thru.
