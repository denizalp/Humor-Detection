A friend brought me here thinking since I was such a huge fan of Greek\/Mediterranean food and Pita Jungle that I would love it.\n\nWrong.\n\nThe location is godawful.  By location I mean, on my visit we were seated outdoors and ash from a hookah lounge kept flying into my eyes and mouth.  I am not even sure if that hookah lounge is still there or not... but if it is... don't sit outdoors at Pita House.  The lounge was not even open while I was there, but the hookahs were outside and the wind just blows that stuff around.  \n\nThe food was just meh.  And the service was subpar.  I ordered a chicken pita and fries and it took an awfully long time.  The fries were sogggggggy.\n\nI won't return, even with all the coupons I see floating around for this place.  I cannot in good conscience give this place a do-over.
