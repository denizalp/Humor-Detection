I woke up at 2 a.m. to feed my baby when it hit me....holy crap, today's the day Bambu officially opens! I have been looking forward to this day since being 8 months pregnant and wished with all my pregnant-craving-might that it would open sooner rather than later....and the day was finally here! I made sure we went there early to be their 1st customers, just to find out they had a soft opening the week before. Super sad face. BUT...we were still their 1st customer on their official grand opening today and I'm certain Mia is their youngest visitor at a whopping 3 weeks old, so I'm happy. ^_^ The owner, Rada, is super cool, and I wish nothing but great success for what is to be Phx's # 1 go-to spot for che (Vietnamese ice dessert 'drinks').\n\nSeeing as they're brand new, there will be kinks they need to work out and I'm sure the place isn't completely finished, but that don't bother me none. The tables were clean and my only suggestion is to have some fun games to play. (i.e. Jenga, Connect 4,  Rock 'em Sock ' em Robots, chess, etc) as I forsee this as a great place to bring the family, meet friends and chill. On to the che review! \n\nMy oldest daughter and I both ordered the #6 (Fruit Addict) which had everything I could love....longan, lychee, jackfruit, coconut meat, toddy palm seed, pandan jelly, red tapioca, and coconut milk and juice. Sooo yum and very refreshing. \n\nMy hubby got a milk tea with crystal boba, and my younger daughter got a Raspberry Rama with crystal boba and added fresh mangos on top. The youngest had breastmilk, but that wasn't on the menu. Lol. Everything together (4 drinks) cost $17 & some change. We loved it and can't wait to try out the other flavors!!! We will definitely be back.
