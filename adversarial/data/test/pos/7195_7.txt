This is a legendary market that non Ohioans enjoy, always nice to see that since most of us are biased. \n\nThe market has tons of food vendors ranging from desserts, meat, cheese, fresh food, and produce. It's very busy as you can imagine and has a good amount of vendors. A true Cleveland classic, stop buy when you're in the area. It's been featured on a few travel shows, glad to see it still thriving.
