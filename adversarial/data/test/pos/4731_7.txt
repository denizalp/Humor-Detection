This place is very racist. I have brought a few people with me and two of the men were black, we were told it was a dress code issue. This place couldn't even explain to me about what was wrong with the dress code or what the dress code was. I've asked for a manager to explain to me about the dress code, but they have told me that the manager is busy. Do not go to this place
