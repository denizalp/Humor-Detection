This park has many activities in such a small area. There are tennis courts, skateboard park, basketball court, swings, a big playground with numerous slides and a big grassy area for picnics, soccer or other types of get togethers. There are also 2 pavilions, one small one for 4 people and a big area. This park is next  to the YMCA DURANGO HILLS location. It's a nice park and our kiddos like coming here. There's a small area to roll down which they love doing. There is a good amount of parking unless the Y is busy than parking can be scarce.
