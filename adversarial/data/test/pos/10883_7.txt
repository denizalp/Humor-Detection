I was introduced to Pinnacle Restoration in Mesa AZ through my insurance company and my Insurance Agent, The Arizona Group.  I unfortunately had a water leak in my condo, and it caused damage to the walls, floors, and ceiling in a certain area.\n\n1) They were very professional\n2) They were very flexible\n3) They were courteous\n4) They were responsive\n5) They were prepared with the right equipment\n\nAll of this allowed my condo to be restored in a timely manner.  They even did some things for me out of courtesy, just beyond the scope of work that they were assigned to do.  I definitely think they are a professional company.  I would recommend Jere Webb and his crew to anybody needing services like this.  \n\nWhile I hope that I never have a water leak again, I definitely may engage Pinnacle in the future, and hopefully not in the same circumstance as this time.  Hopefully it would be something like a home restoration of a \"new\" purchase where the insurance company is not involved, but I am not sure what exactly Pinnacle's business model exactly is, and if they only do insurance work.
