I live right down the road from South Point so, I was beyond excited to see that they had an oyster bar AND happy hour for these oysters Monday thru Thursday 12-4pm.\n\nCame here with my BF and all his roomies. I think we went a little H.A.M. on what we ordered but, I think that's what comes with having days-off....GLUTTONY!!!!\n\nWe had a bottle of wine, oysters Rockefeller (2 orders), pan roast (2 orders), dozen oysters on the half shell (2 orders), calamari, clam chowder, and gumbo. \nIt was my 1st time having oysters Rockefeller and, I'm not sure what took me so long. The oysters\/shell was so large that there was so much oooey-gooey cheese and spinach in the shell.....YUM, I can taste it now!\nPan roast was definately smaller than we expected but, delicious nonetheless. It's not like Palace Stations' pan roasts so, don't expect anything of that caliber here. \nAnd just a note, the rice they serve with the gumbo\/pan roast is the boxed rice...as an Asian who loves her rice, this was a semi-problem.\n\nNo complaints on price though because after splitting the costs among 5 ppl, we paid $40 each. Ridiculously not bad for all the food we had.
