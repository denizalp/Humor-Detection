I have always loved coming to this buffet when im in Vegas. It never disappoints and always has a great variety of food. The last time i was here was about 5 years ago and i heard from some friends that they did a little make over and added alot more food as well. Woah, wait how can they possiby fit anymore food stations in here, they have almost every kind of food knowen to man errr women to be matter of fact! But i guess not!  We decided to start our buffet challange here. And let me tell you when you come to the Carnival make sure you have alot of patience because it takes a little while to actually get seated. When we arrived after paying for our dealio, we stood in line for a good 20-25minutes waiting to be seated along with the other's who were also waiting in line. It seemed like it was slow inside the buffet and there were tables and booths that were open. Maybe they were understaffed that day. There was one hostess who was working the three lines of people. One at a time she would ask how many in the party then let you go, wait another 5 mintues then go to the next line and repeat! Come on lady we have 4 very hungry Yelper waiting to get their hungry hungry hippo on!!!  At last we were finally seated.\nOut waiter was nice, took our orders for drinks (non alcoholic). It took him a little while but we finally got our order. If you want alcoholic drinks the bar is located in the middle of the buffet and is pretty reasonable priced. They have drink special just about every half hour as well.\n\nInstead of telling you what i ate: Here are some of the highlights that they have here:\n\nCarving station that serves Prime rib and Ham. I had a slice of both, the prime rib was so overcooked that it was a challange to cut it so i gave up! The ham was cooked prefect and tasted yummy!\n\nMashed potatoes, ribs, and assorted vegetables\n\nSushi ( I wouldnt recommend it)\n\nHush puppies, onion rings, and shrimp,fried fish fillets,taquitos and wings\n\nAnorexic crab legs, peel-and-eat shrimp and Scallops\n\nA full salad bar\n\nPancakes, Eggs, Waffles, Bagels, Muffins, Lox, Cream Cheese, Omelettes, Hash Browns, Bacon Bacon Bacon!!\n\nPlenty of pasta with various sauces in case you want to make your own\n\nPizza of all kinds\n\nEgg rolls and various dim sum and even BBQ pork! \n\nMade-to-order stations were popular and served: \nPho \nStir-fry\n\nTacos that you can build yourself and quesadillas\n\nDesserts:\nA gelato bar serves eight different flavors\nVarious mini cheesecakes\nSlices of pie and cakes\nFresh Fruit\nRaspberry filled churros\nCookies\nCream Puffs\nBananas foster\n\nThey also have alot of sugar free desserts as well!!\n\nBetween the four of us we totally killed the buffet, and walked away in total buffet coma's.
