The suites at Palazzo are absolutely stunning! Stayed here on our vegas trip this past weekend and it was so relaxing. The rooms are really clean and the beds are very plush. It's very classy and the amenities they provided had everything you'd need. All the amenities are in this little box which include ear swabs, nail filer, sewing kit, shower cap, etc. They also include bath robes and slippers! The shower and bath tub are separate, I actually liked the shower more because of the back massage built in it. Such a great feature to use especially after a long day\/night of partying. I also liked the double sinks and the hair blow dryer was actually strong, not like the weak ones you'd find at cheaper hotels. The suites in here are huge, the living room has 3 tables, a pullout sofa bed, and fax\/printer. The automatic blinds were also a nice touch. I would have to say this is one of my favorite hotels, better than the room at The Wynn.\n\nWe had a great view of the pools (I believe there were 7 pools at this casino). We also paid extra for access to The Prestige room in the Palazzo. It was so awesome! Basically you can skip the buffet line and just grab food at The Prestige to bring back to your room. Breakfast had lots of items like boiled eggs, oatmeal, fruits, assorted pastries, coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon, etc etc. they also serve many different items for lunch & dinner. The Prestige is a huge room and really fancy, you're not allowed in if not properly dressed.\n\nThe casino floor isn't that great here and not as lively as other casinos, but there are plenty of shops & restaurants in the hotel. Just like the Bellagio, they have an area where they decorate with different holiday\/seasonal themes and it's really pretty.
