Continuing my Gordon Ramsey experience, next on the list Gordon Ramsey burger. His steak house that i tried first was fantastic! So I'm assuming his burger joint would be the same. It was! Fantastic!\n\nFirst off the ambiance is great, lots of hustle and bustle going on. All the servers are active and constantly moving. My server was great. Extremely knowledgable of the menu which is great, getting her opinion was very helpful because everything on the menu looked amazing and was hard to choose!\n\nI ended up trying an appetizer, a burger, side dish nod dessert. For appetizer I had the hummus with grilled flat bread and veggie sticks. It was excellent! The hummus had so much flavor! I couldn't stop eating it, it was so good. Oh for a drink I had this amazing shake! A crème brûlée Oreo cookie shake! Sooo good! Talk about taking a shake to the next level! Presentation is beautiful and the taste is even better! For my burger I had the Euro burger. truffle aïoli + goat cheese + arugula + oven roasted tomato. Oh my heavens it was delicious! Perfectly cooked, and bursting with flavor! Everything in the burger went together well like perfect harmony. My side dish was Parmesan truffle fries. Addicting! Fresh cut fries covered with Parmesan with a truffle sauce for dipping! Soo good! Also came with a second sauce, a BBQ ketchup with an Asian taste to it of some sort which was amazing! For dessert I went with his signature dish the sticky toffee pudding. Only I come to find out that he prepares it differently at each restaurant. This version was a cold version that was like a push-up ice cream pop! Delish!\n\nYet another fantastic experience at his restaurant. Went in with a smile, left with a bigger smile like the joker!
