My new absolute favorite frozen yogurt place. And now that it has edible cookie dough... I might as well live here. There are beyond a ton of toppings to chose from. My favorite being anything cereal and they have 4 out at all times. I've tried 3 of the cookie dough flavors. My favorite was Vanilla Cupcake Batter but honestly they were all good. They change the flavors of their yogurt seasonally. There really isn't more I could possibly as for in a frozen yogurt shop besides being a little closer to my house. :)
