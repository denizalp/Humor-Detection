Located in an old strip mall at the corner of Sahara and Valley View, this place is fairly large, with much of their space dedicated to the production of their pastries. Their display cases are fairly extensive, offering a wide variety of items. There are several tables available and on the Saturday I stopped by the place was swarming with people.\n\nTheir almond croissant was decent. A better option was their apple danish with its buttery pastry, sweet apples, and icing and slivered almonds on top. Their cheesecake was particularly good, as well. Simply decorated with a bit of chocolate and whipped cream, it was surprisingly airy and light, while also creamy and smooth.\n\n3.5 Stars
