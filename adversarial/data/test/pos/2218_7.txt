My wife and I were moving into our new house -- long story short, -- we just weren't going to have the time to give the place a good, thorough, \"move in\" cleaning. But these folks handled it very well. They were amazing. I'm impressed.\n\nOur friend referred us to TidyWhity, and the fact that they can come by on such short notice (~36 hours), we chose TidyWhity.\n\nBottom line: they were awesome, professional (even wrote us a thank you card) and we were very happy to move into our new home.\n\nHighly recommended.
