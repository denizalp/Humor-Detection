An awesome, somewhat-hidden gem in the Forum Shops.\n\nThe staff at the shop is excellent. Friendly, funny, full of suggestions but never pushy. There were samples a-plenty of both bars and truffles, and we wound up taking some truffles home ourselves... don't miss the Funk & Disco (banana) and make sure to give the \"iffier\" flavors a try like Naga (curry).
