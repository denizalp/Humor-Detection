I  can really only review the Breakfast Burritos at this location, but OMG...... they are good!!!\nI always get the Bacon Breakfast Burrito and I add Pico De Gallo! Then I get some red sauce from their salsa bar, and add red sauce on a bite for bite basis!!!!\nSeriously, add red sauce take a bite.... add red sauce, take a bite.....\nThis is usually after a night I have been drinking, I wake up late and go get this magical hang over burrito.\nFABULOUS!
