i'm irish. like red hair, freckles, i like lucky charms irish. this place.... isn't irish. sure, it's got Guinness signs and there's Harp on tap, but ahhhhh no. it tries. it really does. i think they had something on the menu called the 'dublin burger'. see? it's trying.\n\nhaving said that and dispelling this silly rumor that this place is an irish pub, i have to say that its not terribly awful. i dug the whole two bars thing (one in the establishment and one out back on the patio). i love patios. i'm a sucker for outdoor drinking. they have heat lamps out there for when AZ is not 110 degrees. its pretty nice.\n\nservice was so so. the bartendress in the front wasn't exactly attentive and kind didn't give a crap if we wanted food or not. the waitress on the patio was great. she was on top of our drink orders and even anticipated others. pretty spiffy.\n\nfood was decent. i split the fish and chips and the irish potato nacho-y thingies. for the money, i would say it really wasn't worth it. i would probably head down to gordon biersch to get some bang for your buck in that area but the beer selection was decent and they had harp on tap. points there. \n\ndecent place to grab a beer. i also saw that they have a live band come in from time to time. dunno how great that sounds being indoors in that smallish area, but \/shrug. to each his own.
