So, this used to be Dave's Electric Brewpub. It was OK at that time. Now that it has changed hands...again, so many times...\n\nWhatever, taken on its own merits, this place sucks. Plastic cups, plastic utensils...but not a discount price. $6 for a crappy breakfast burrito. I have had better burritos from a frozen wrapper. They were out of most of the drinks, champagne for mimosas, most of the beers. I see the end looming.\n\nI wonder what crappy place is going to be here next.
