This is the place I picture myself going to when I'm a chain smoking divorcee looking to dance in an alley lane trying to attract that special someone (I mean this as a compliment!)\n\nThere is something charming about this place. It's cheap, food is greasy, the decor is predictable, and yet still, it reminds me of hanging out at the bowling alley as a teenager. There are always groups of kids, families, and young couples. This place doesn't attract a loud crowd and its a cheap place to go on a Friday night. \n\nOverall fun!
