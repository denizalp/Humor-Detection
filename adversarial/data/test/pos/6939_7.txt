Bally's, you've lost a customer for life! \n\nFellow Yelpers, if your time is worth any amount of money, avoid staying at Bally's at any cost since you will be held captive in their check in line for about an hour. I came during a Wed night but I can only imagine the frustration during a weekend... (There is also a line for Diamond and Platinum members but even that line was 7 people deep with 1 check in agent). In addition, if your reservation was made on the same day you won't be able to use their mobile online checkin. This is 2016, not 1999... get with it Bally's!\n\nIn any case, obviously the hotel doesn't have their best interest at heart. The faster they check people in, the faster they will be on the casino floor, eating in the restaurants or spending money in a variety of other ways rather than waiting in line for check-in. If you are considering Bally's due to the low price, I'd highly suggest Paris instead since they have a row of automated check in kiosks so you are in and out and are able to enjoy your time in Vegas starting on right note.\n\nOh and also, the renovation in the front of the property makes you feel as if you are walking through a flea market every time you want to return from the strip...
