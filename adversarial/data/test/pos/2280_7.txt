Awful airline.  Flight was delayed for 3:36 hours.  Mechanical issues.  \nNo compensation offered.  Waited at arrival airport's customer service counter for a half hour and no agents appeared.  Contacted via email and chat.  Told they don't offer compensation because they cannot offer it to the whole passenger list.  Refused to let me speak with a supervisor.\n\nI get that it is a cheap budget airline.  I get the cramped seats, dirty wall above the window next to my seat, and angry, mean flight attendants.  \n\nBut what a mess.
