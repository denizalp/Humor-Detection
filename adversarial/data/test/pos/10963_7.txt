I went with a friend when she got her windows tinted, she went to Precision and they really hooked her up. She just got her window tinted and it did take as long as mine. They have amazing customer service and the waiting room was actually nice compared to others I've seen. The guy that helps us was Brian Morrison and he was super friendly and a totally helpful. He got me and my friend in and out. I wish they did other services so i could come here. It's been a week or two and all the bubbles are gonna like they said and her car looks great they really took care of her and made it a great experience.
