I had never flown with American Airlines before and that is because I am deeply in love with Southwest Airlines, unfortunately SW doesn't fly to Hawaii. \nAnyway, I thought my first brush with AA was just a one time thing. I show up to check in, their personnel is rude, not helpful, they let me stand in line waiting to check in and when I get to the counter instead of helping me they direct me to self check in where I have to wait behind people, again. \nWhen I get to the gate they announced that it was a full flight and they needed people to volunteer to check their bags. I did, but some other folks decided not to. When we were boarding, they stopped the customer in front of me and told her she could not bring her carry on, that she needed to check it. AA staff member began arguing with customer telling her she had to check it, no matter what. She even said TO the costumer \"please go find a supervisor so you can tell her you don't want to check your bag\"--- what the hell?\nWhen I her get to AA staff member and hand her my boarding pass she is rolling her eyes, sighing and talking shit about the customer to me! What the hell?!!! \nI kept going through this boarding process in disbelief of what I had just seen.\nAnyway, the 6 hour flight begins... And when they come around asking what I want to drink I said i wanted a ginger ale to what she said \"Oh Ginger Ale? Good luck, we'll see!\" What the hell?!! They didn't have it so I didn't get anything not even an offer for anything else. No snacks AT ALL. I arrive to Hawaii so I don't really care at this time. \n\nOn my way back, same thing, super misleading and indifferent service at counter. \nWe departed late which means we arrived late making it their fault that I missed my connection flight. You would think they'd make an effort to hold the other flight for you since it was their FAULT we were late! We landed right next to the gate I needed to go, I mean, where is their communication? I sprint out of my flight to see the door of my next flight slowly boarding. A staff member sees me running and instead of holding the door or stopping it from closing or anything he says, with his hands behind his back and in an all sarcastic tone \"it's closed\" \nOh my gosh! I almost wanted to punch him! You could have stopped it and it was still 10 mins until take off but because the door was closed there was nothing they could do. \nSo then I go to costumer service to get rerouted. I have to wait 10-15 mins in line, to get to the counter to have the staff members behind it talking shit about their jobs, other coworkers and their shift. All without acknowledging me, no apology, no instructions, no nothing, just a new boarding pass.... How unprofessional! \nAnd as I am waiting to board this new flight, they just announced the over booked and they need three passengers to change their plans for $150 voucher. That's a joke! \nIf southwest ever requested that from a customer they could compensate greatly. \nI mean, there is no comparison, none of this would have happened if SW had service to Hawaii. \nThe worst flying experience! Never again. \nTheir workers are so unhappy and you can feel it.
