**This review if for the Men of OG**\n\nI had very high hopes for my recent trip to OG for my bachelorette party...these hopes were met and exceeded!\n\nThere were 7 of us in total. I had booked an online package that included a limo ride from the Monte Carlo, admission, and two drinks per person. The limo arrived on time and was in constant contact.\n\nWhen we arrived at OG, it took just a second to check ID's and find my reservation and we were whisked inside. You have to walk on the outskirts of the female stripper area to get to the stairs. There was a quiet, sensual vibe. No one was talking and the music was fairly quiet. As we ascended the stairs, we noticed the booming music and the shrieks of happy women. And then, the party was fucking on.\n\nWe got seated and our waiter came over immediately. We decided to get a bottle (it was just a few bucks more and then we could decide on the strength of our drinks). As the booze is being placed on our table we see a wall of unbelievably attractive men walking our way. A simple \"No thank you, we want to get a drink down before any decisions are made\" was enough to give us some time to browse. When I found one I liked, my friends arranged for me to be double-teamed up on stage. So fun. We got most of my girls lap dances right in front of us so we could laugh and take pictures (we have over 300 from that night). All in all, it was probably the most fun I have ever had with my girls.\n\nLet me take a moment to talk about 3 of the men in particular. Jimmy(**see below) was my first pick. He had boyish good looks and incredible balancing skills :). He was also polite and not pushy. We got most of our dances from him. Carlos is fucking beautiful. He asked me if there was anyone that I thought needed a dance. I had one friend who was so mesmerized but pretty shy. I asked him to give her a few minutes to get some booze ingested. He came back later and she was as ready as she was ever going to be. I asked him to be gentle, and he was very considerate of my requests and her bashfulness. The guys really feed off of your energy. If you slap them, they will be rough with you. If you look scared, they will be sweet instead of crude.\n\nI need a new paragraph for Spartacus. I can't even...I don't...I need a moment. You still there? I'm sorry but I don't think I have enough words in my vocabulary to discuss how hot he is. We couldn't get enough. When he wasn't dancing for us, our eyes followed him around the room to watch him dance for other women. He. Is. A. God. I can only hope that he is still there when the next of my friends gets married so we can all bask in his tanned glory once more.\n\nThere were only 2 guys out of 20(?) I wasn't impressed with, mainly because they were just shitty dancers and seemed bored. Every other guy WORKED his ass off for his money. Expect us back as soon as we can get someone else married!\n\n**In the first version of this review, I mistakenly called Jimmy, Ricky. I'm glad someone (who will remain nameless) pointed out this egregious error. All I can say for myself is the combination of booze and hot bodies gave me brain damage. Apologies to Jimmy...we love you!
