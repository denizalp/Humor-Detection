Buca di Beppo will fill you up!\n\nI have always been a huge fan of Bucca. The atmosphere in these restaurants are very fun and support the theme they are trying to represent. I really love how they tour you through the kitchen on your first visit. Very classy and old school Italian vibe.\n\nI can here with a friend for dinner. I remember I was starving when I arrived here, and couldn't wait to eat! The service here was outstanding! Our waiter Samantha took very great care of us, making sure we had full beverages and if we needed anything additional. \n\nThe menu has a fine selection of pastas, entrees, and great dessert dishes.\n\nI ordered a pasta dish a la carte, I did the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. Also ordered the cheese bread with it. The Alfredo sauce was very delicious with a sweat flavor to it. \n\nNext time I visit this place I am going to try their spaghetti dish, and also try a glass of their wines. \n\nSuch a great experience coming here, and I truly do recommend it!
