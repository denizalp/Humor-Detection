DO NOT GO HERE!!! I went there today for a massage. It was adequate. At the end they inform me that it's $20 cash only. I had to walk next door and get cash to pay. I handed him 2-20s and he said thank you. When I asked for change and he said well how much are you going to tip. I said $5 and he screamed \"no way $10 minimum\". WTH? I don't get 50% tips. I can't believe they get away with this. Don't the policies need to be posted somewhere?  I am darn sure they aren't paying taxes. I would even say that most of the people working here are not here legally. Time for some sort of govermental checkup at this place.
