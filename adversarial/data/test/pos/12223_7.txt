Okay UO is pretty nice despite it's discriminatory agenda and the controversies with stealing artist's works and mass producing them, I'll admit that. But what's the harm in looking around at all the fun stuff they have for sale as long as I don't buy anything to support them right?\n\nThe store is pretty nicely laid out, there are household decorations in the back, some cool clothes in the front, and trinkets and fun things scattered throughout. If they ever decide not to be homophobes, transphobes or offensive to everyone and change a few policies around I'll be more than happy to give them my money but until then it's pretty much Breakfast At Tiffany's for me.
