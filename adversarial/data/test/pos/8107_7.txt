What a spectacular way to close out a long week in Vegas. A tasty breakfast at the famed Bouchon.\n\nWe only had 40 minutes and the staff was super accommodating with our schedule, taking orders from 1\/2 of us who had to leave and bringing out the food quite quickly. My coffee took a big longer to arrive but they were hustling for the most part.\n\nThe place is just beautiful, bright and open with tall ceilings, and leading to the outdoor area of the Venetzia tower patio, it takes a trek to get there from any of the other Venetian towers, but after your first bite, the 15 minute maze-like walk through suites and visits to multiple elevators easily becomes worth it.\n\nStrawberry croissant was THE pastry of the day and it lived up to the hype. i I figured...come on...a croissant is a croissant right ? Some butter and strawberries in a flakey crust. been there done that, many times over. Heck No. \n\nWhen this thing arrived, split in half lengthwise, topped with strawberries and jam and then some sort of crumbly top crust which had then been baked, it was an ooey gooey yummy mess of strawberries and flakiness with a sweet crumbly topping--reminded me a bit of strudel topping. Sweet cinnamony goodness. And that was just the pastry that came with my 'breakfast americaine'. \n\nIt also came with eggs (whites for me), a huge container of pomme frites, brioche toast, sausage AND bacon, orange juice AND coffee. It was more food than even *I* could put away in one sitting.\n\nWe manhandled our swollen bellies back over to the palazzo, got our stuff and checked out....powered for hours on end through the airport visit and even after getting home on the amazing 'farewell to Vegas' breakkie we had at Bouchon.
