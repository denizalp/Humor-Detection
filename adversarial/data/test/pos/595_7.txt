This is a great place to find some unique items to purchase as gifts or for yourself. This location is one of a few along The Strip. \n\nThey have a decent jewelry collection made with a variety of gym stones,  a unique collection of leather belts that are custom for you (comes in different leather types including snake, alligator and ostrich) and other items like shark teeth and Michigan copper. \n\nThe employees were friendly and helpful.  I think that they are worth at least a leisure walk through.
