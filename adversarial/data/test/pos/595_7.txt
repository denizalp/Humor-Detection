I agree with another reviewer that this Toy shop is more like a \"labor of love\" - like a personal collection in a store? Everything was over priced and much smaller than I thought - \nI really wanted to visit this store after watching Johnny on Pawn Stars, and being a huge toy fan. So I dragged my family through downtown, fought the heat and finally found this small hidden store- \nAt first sight I was excited for my 12 year old girl to see all the old school toys I once played with, it was a Sunday so I didn't see Johnny there- no big deal, but no one even talked to me or acknowledged us-\nBUT, what really tweaked me was there was a TV on with a DVD of a comedian that was cussing, dropping F bombs and talking about masturbating with the volume really loud???? So I quickly whisked my little girl away and walked to the other side of the store- I didn't get to say anything to the only employee there who was clueless and talking away with his buddy! \nSo I gathered my family and left!! \nJohnny I'm super disappointed in the fact that a TOY STORE should NOT have a DVD playing like that!!!  I don't care if it's Vegas, it's inappropriate!!! \nPARENTS- be aware, apparently this store is for 30+ year old nerds - not children\n\nSorry Johnny, I'm sure your a great guy- just letting you know how we felt about our first and last time at your store -
