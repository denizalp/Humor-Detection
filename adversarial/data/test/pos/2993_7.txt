I feel like everyone knows about this festival and have heard many things about it... But the fact of it is: your experience is 100% dependent on you and who you surround yourself with. As 4th year attendee, I don't really have much complaints besides the rising ticket prices. \n\nI never fail to have a great experience no matter how \"mainstream\" this festival gets. Every year this festival grows and attracts more people -- different people -- so the crowd changes. And with 100-150k people a day in one little place, you can't predict who you will meet or see. So I give this festival five stars, because Insomniac has yet to make a festival that doesn't disappoint. The crowd changes and people can be rude but just ignore them and have fun!\n\nAside from all the PLUR and EDM and rave talk, here are some protips for future years:\n- stay hydrated, duh! \n- bring baby wipes.. It'll help your bathroom situation.. Toilet paper is scarce lol. \n- If possible, bring your own hand sani too. \n- security searches depend on the individual that is searching you so not every single person has the same experience \n- bring cash!!!! \n- as much as you may want to stay for the entire last set, I found that leaving even 30 minutes earlier during the last set made the difference of being in traffic for ~40 mins instead of 3 hours. \n- and as much as you want to come a little later, coming when doors open means you can park closer (or even right next) to the exit AND avoid incoming traffic. \n- turn off iMessage (if you have an iPhone). It'll help with receiving\/sending texts. Use time stamps after messages too for more accuracy in timing. \n- and lastly, have fun!! Don't mind others!
