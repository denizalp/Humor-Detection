Note-I was last there in September. \n\nOh yeah, it's what you think it is; very Old World.  It also reminded my of my grandmother's place, being that she lived in South Side for most of her life. I almost felt like I was in her kitchen.\n\nThey have a tarot card reader there on Sundays, but you have to make an appointment. I had it done during each of my previous visits. It's interesting, but I don't put too much stock in it. I think most of the readers are just very insightful people who can tell what certain people want to hear. The gal's name is Rebecca. They have someone else reading during the week. \n\nAnyway, the last two times I ate there, I found the food to be lackluster. I can't even remember what I had.\n\nThis time though, however, everything was excellent, succulent. \n\nQuoting their menu, I had the...\n\n\"Roasted Garlic, Artichoke, and Scallion Dip with toasted pita.\"\n\n\"Mediterranean Salmon- A salmon fillet broiled Medium and topped with chopped green and Kalamata olives and fresh tomato, finished with tomato-basil aioli (!), and served with summer vegetable cous cous.\"\n \nThen I had a \"Chocolate Caramel Tart.\"  In between courses we had some other cheese\/spread with capers in it. It wasn't on their online menu, and I can't remember what it was called, but tasty, rich, and creamy it was.\n\nI also tasted my mother's pork soulvaki (?) goulash dish (I can't remember the exact name), and it was delish. My mom sleuthed the recipe and made it for me a week later. Yum-yum-eat-em-up. It was tangy, thickened and could fill a laborer's belly just fine. \n \nThe service was on point and the funky, ethnic, superstitious atmosphere was hard to top.\n \nAnyway, check Gypsy Cafe out if you're ever in South Side.  I know I'll be returning.
