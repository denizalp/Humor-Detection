I don't have much to say about this place beyond it being my favorite place for dessert on any given night and anybody who knows me knows that is high praise.\n\nI love the rotating flavors here as they are usually pretty tasty and live up to their name. Snickers yogurt tastes like a snickers bar, Rootbeer Float tastes like one, and creamsicle is just amazing.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful. Another big thing for me is that the places is always clean especially around the food items.\n\nThey do a rewards system that works out to 1 free for every 10. Checking in on yelp also gives you a buy one get one free every time.
