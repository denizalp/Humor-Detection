Tired of when the dining environment becomes overcast with many restaurants charging so much for so little? If so, there is a rainbow at the end of the overcast dining environment. \n\n   The Rainbow Club has been a downtown Henderson institution since 1984 when the Peppermill Group brought it. For over thirty years, the Rainbow Club has been serving quality food at old school prices. \n\n   Oftentimes, good things come in small packages. The Rainbow Club is an infinitesimal property that fits into a small downtown Henderson block. It is primarily a casino, bar, and restaurant. The best way to describe the Rainbow Club is as three long rectangles. The casino is one rectangle. The long bar in the center is the second rectangle. And the long and skinny restaurant in the back, which is Images is the third rectangle. Images (the only restaurant) with its long and skinny layout reminds me of a railroad dining car. \n\n   Over a couple of handful of times recently, I have dined in the Rainbow Club. I would experience four different items from the menu: 1) chicken parmesan with pasta, 2) meat loaf, 3) chicken fettuccine, 4) and Cajun chicken pasta. Every single one of these dishes exemplified a fantastic deal. The highest price is  $7.75. Where else in Vegas can you enjoy a chicken parmesan dinner for $7.75? The Rainbow gives a large portion. I remember last visit, bringing half of the chicken fettuccine home. The food that they give so much of is quality. At the Rainbow quantity equals quality. With the entre, the Rainbow includes either a soup or salad. One weakness in regards to the salad is there is a want for tomatoes. At the Rainbow, the service has also been right on. \n\n  The Rainbow may not be a gold rush to gamblers, but it is a mellow place to play at the bar. Several monitors hang over the long bar that turns the place into a professional sports entertainment center. The place comes alive during the NFL games. Just like the food, the drink prices are old school. $1.75 for a bottle of Budweiser is a gold rush for beer drinkers. As far as video Keno, they seem to target the nickel domination over quarters. Mellowed out after a tasty inexpensive meal that followed an outdoor adventure, I enjoyed quaffing a beer while looking up at the professional sports game, looking down at the dime Caveman Keno that kept my money in action and listening to the oldies and locals joke with the bartender. \n\n  If you want to experience one of the greatest restaurant values in town, then just follow the Rainbow.
