Unlike most people, I've never had an issue w the DMV in my 14yrs here. Somehow, I've always managed to be in and out in under 30 minutes. But that was at the Henderson and Flamingo locations... This is Sahara and it's exactly the cluster I've heard about for years, but that was partly my fault.\n\nNotice all the recent happy 5 star reviews? Those people had the sense to make appointments ahead of time. My crap experience could've totally been avoided if I hadn't waited till days before my ID expired. Be sure to make an appointment online at least a week in advance before all the spots fill up, and I've been told that half an hour is realistic. \n\nIf you insist on procrastinating like me, your experience will probably be more like this:  \n\n-Wait in the registration line, which is long but moves pretty quickly. They check you in and make sure you have all the right documents \n-No number tickets are given out. You get called by the last 4 of your phone number. I was worried because they seem to call out numbers faster than bingo, but you also get a text so you don't have to actively pay attention. I guess you're SOL without a cell phone\n-Wait....and wait...and wait..... Go to your designated window, do whatever you're here for, then you're done! For the 217 people in the queue ahead of me, the estimated time was about 2hrs, but it was closer to 3hrs.\n\nLesson learned - don't come to Flamingo, and whatever location you go to, MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WAY AHEAD OF YOUR EXPIRATION
