Fabulous repeat of what use to be here (Sugar Factory) but gone are the whimsical delights to be replaced by something darker and geared towards adults.\n\nHexx continues to serve up gelato, ice cream, candies, and other various treats for those seeking solace from the ambient heat emanating from the 106 degree scorchers outside.\n\nI opted for the Limoncello and the Amarena. The frosty duet was a pleasure away from our walk all the way down to the SLS Resort.\n\nOne thing that was obnoxious. Given it was so late at night and I noticed an open bunch of stools towards the back of the chocolate bar.  We were shooed away, even though there was no one there AND we had just purchased items in the store.  Perhaps the chocolate gal could step outside and shoo away the rest of the non-paying clientele out front stealing seats? That might be a bit more corrigible and aligned with a better business practice, non?
