After taking a red eye to Wisconsin last week, I made a pit stop in Arizona before reaching my destination in Milwaukee.\n\nUpon landing at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in the morning, I was starving..........and decided to walk around the airport to forge for some morning grindz. \n\nAfter walking around long enough, I decided on trying this place called - La Madeleine Country French Cafe. \nThe main reason why I came here was that there was no long lines (as the other places appeared to be a lot busier).\n\nI ended up ordering the French Breakfast & a coffee - which came out to $11.24. \n\nWhat was in the French Breakfast? I got a croissant, bacon, eggs, a tomato slice, & this potato hash thing with some crap in it. (sorry gang, don't know what that was).\n\nWhat can I say about this place..........well, airport food is airport food. I knew exactly what I was gonna get so I really didn't have too much high expectations, and all I can say is..........to have something to eat, is better than having nothing at all. \n\nComing here, don't expect that you will be sitting in a French Cafe............or having elegant French food! It just another fast food place with a fancy name........that's all I have to say about that. \n\nCoffee wasn't too good either..........I guess I should have gone to Starbucks instead. Le sigh...........Lol!
