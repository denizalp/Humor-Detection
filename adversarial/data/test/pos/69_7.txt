Super happy (and smooth) customer here!\nI found TBS on yelp when in need of a quick wax while in Vegas (because well duh- it's Vegas!) I called right as they opened and was able to get an appt within the hour. It's very clean and has fun hip decor and calm atmosphere. Paige did my full leg and Brazilian and she was ah-mazing!!! She made me feel 100 % comfortable right from the get go which can be difficult when you're laying there spread eagle with someone you just met! I thought the waxing was pretty painless for the most part. And again, Paige really did a great job of getting everything in one go around. I've been waxing for years but this was my 1st time getting a stripless wax and I have to say I am new convert! My skin isn't irritated at all, I wasn't left with little tiny red pores and bumps all over as I am with a fresh strip wax and my skin is noticeably softer and smoother. \nI wish I lived in Vegas because Paige and TBS would be my new go-to place!
