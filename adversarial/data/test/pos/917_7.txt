If the kid's area\nis any indication\nof what the rest of this library\nis like,\nthen I cannot help\nbut give this place 5 stars.\n\nThe clean, open, and comfortable\nreading space of the children's\nlibrary was so accommodating\nto kiddies and parents\nalike that I found myself\nlounging with my little one.\n\nMoreover, the story book room\nis simply awesome\nand helps to encourage reading\nas well as a love of books\nat a very formative age.\n\nA library that encourages reading?\nImagine that.
