Luke's Lobster Las Vegas is a stand alone little eatery, located a the Fashion Show mall with it's own private outdoor seating (not dog friendly) and other additional outdoor seating surrounding it (if you do want to dine with your 4 legged friend like my husband and I). \n\nI came by this place 2 Saturdays ago, a little before 12 pm. Only 1 employee was inside this tiny little place, behind the register. I looked over the paper menu and ended up ordering:  \n\nThe Lobster Trap, $29 prior to tax- Oh boy, what an incredibly pricey meal. This is definitely a trap, the tourist kind. This entree comes with a lobster roll, 1\/2 lobster tail and a cup of the lobster corn chowder. The size of the meal is good for 1 person. For the lobster roll, large buttery pieces of lobster is served on a piece of toasted white fluffy bread (not on a roll at all). I thought it was good but I would have preferred to have the butter omitted since a side of butter is served on the side so that I can choose to add it on my own (with as much of as little as I desire). The half lobster tail was okay. I thought the lobster corn chowder was average. \n--------------------------\n(Total= $31.39 after tax)\n\nMy husband was annoyed with me that I wanted to try this because of all the highly rated reviews. He scoffed at the price (but still ended up eating more than half of my meal). \n\nThe girl behind the counter had informed me that the outdoor seating is not dog friendly but the other tables outside around this eatery allows for me to be outside dining with my little girl dog. She said that she will have an employee come out and deliver my order to me. \n\nNot too long of a wait, an employee came out to bring out my meal. He forgot to bring me napkins and a spoon. So he left and came back about 5 minutes later with 1 napkin and 1 plastic spoon. \n\nHonestly, I thought the food was average. The price is pretty high for what I got. Granted, I know that seafood is pricey, but I have had better, especially at the price. And being in Sin City, there are buffets with good lobster tails where the admission price is ~$50.\n\nI am sorry Las Vegas, but I was expecting better. \n\nIf you disagree with me, then so be it. At least you will have 1 less person to wait in line for to order your lobster roll.
