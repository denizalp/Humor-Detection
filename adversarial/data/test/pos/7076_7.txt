Fantastic if you're looking for the 2014 version of Sizzler. Crying babies, Wal Mart refugees, jumbo tables of loud families, over cooked steak, mailer coupons offering 25% off. \n\nIf you are on a tight budget or a family of 6+ this is the place for you. Looking for a romantic dinner or an above average steak meal this isn't the spot. \n\nRolls are tasty.
