3.5 stars.  Located inside the Arizona Biltmore, this is the more casual of their two main restaurants.  \n\nMy husband and I had dinner here, and were both pleased.  The green chili chicken empanadas were a bit dry, but tasty nonetheless.  The New York strip was perfectly cooked and topped with a mound of garlic butter and served with sea salt fries which were fantastic.\n\nBumping to 4 stars for outstanding service.  Definitely worth a trip back in better weather to enjoy their patio!
