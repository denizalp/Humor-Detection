Such an amazing addition to the Neighborhood! From service to food everything has been a positive experience so far. And huge plus that it's just walking distance from my job!\n\nIt located on Oquendo and Forte Apache in a small lot that can be quite easy to miss. There is tons of parking, however I noticed when I went on a Sunday it got pretty crowded and cars were parking in the dirt lot next door. \n\nMenu is not big but quality is always better than quantity. So far I have tried their Shakshuka, Salmon Toast, Coconut Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito and a little bit of my friends Steak and Eggs. I have also tried their Queen Bee Latte, Lavender Latte, Chai Latte and Matcha Latte. \n\nShakshuka with sourdough bread has been my favorite. So good that I went there two days in a row and ordered just that lol. I feel like there just isn't enough bread to eat it with though :( also there is no meat included but my bf ordered sausage on the side and it was even better with the meat. \n\nCoconut pancakes would be my second favorite. The lemony syrup they use just absorbs into pancake nicely and the berries and toasted coconut go great together. And I'm not even a fan of dried coconuts. \n\nBreakfast burrito was delicious and Salmon toast was just ok. It was pretty much a Nova Lox bagel replaced with a slice of sourdough. \n\nNow the lattes. I would rate it as Lavender, Queen Bee, Chai then Matcha. Lavender had the most flavor and was the best tasting IMO. Queen Bee was also really good. It was a slight taste of honey and a lot of cinnamon. Chai latte wasn't anything special and Matcha lacked in flavor. \n\nService was good all the times I've went. Nothing bad to say there. \n\nDefinitely recommend stopping by here.
