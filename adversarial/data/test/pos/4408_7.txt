This spa is located within the Super 8 hotel on Spadina ave in chinatown. The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor and the spa is located off the lobby. May be a bit convoluted to find but persevere, it is worth it. \n\nAsk for Sophia for a massage. I like a hard massage and the massage  changes depending on what you need that day. She is amazingly sensitive to your body and somehow she feels where the problems are and figures out the best massage technique and hardness to use without you telling her.  She is able to do massages at different intensity and specificity.  She can use fingers, hands, elbows, feet to apple the pressure as required.  Her english is pretty good and you can tell her what you need as well but i have been going to her for a few years now and she just knows my needs of that day within a few minutes.  \n\ni was reluctant to provide a review as she might get too popular but she is really good and deserves more business.  I call ahead. i have tried quite a few masseuses in different cities and she is the best, by far.  She was great from day one.\n\nOh yeh, if you love a hard reflexology massage. Ask for Michelle. The only better one that i have had was in Beijing but that is not going to happen soon. I have a high pain tolerance but i suspect that she can dial it down easily. \n\nThese ladies really are good.
