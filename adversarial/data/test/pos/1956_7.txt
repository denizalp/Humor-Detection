I saw you last year -- shimmering in the dry, southwest sun as the heat rays beat down on all of the Strip like a laser beam from the Death Star. You were beautiful; you've always been beautiful with your colorfully tinted exterior windows, that striking architecture that makes me weak in the knees. No, you don't have a light beam a la Luxor to protect you from extraterrestrial attacks but that's how bold you are. And now, I can tell everybody that I've been inside you.\n\nEw, guys...such perverted minds. Aria has been my must-try LV spot for the past couple of years; unfortunately, I haven't had the chance till a couple of weeks ago due to comps and too-good-to-pass-up offers at other mid-tier places. In retrospect, that's not such a bad problem to have #humblebrag #notreally #hashtagsinyelpreviews #lol\n\nI'm really racking my brain trying to find a flaw in our stay but I simply can't. True, it's a bit more expensive but really, there's no better way to do a Vegas trip than the right way which unfortunately means you gotta pay to play, literally. I'd like to note that's how you properly use 'literally.' Location matters in Vegas, especially if you're carless and don't wanna taxi all over the place. Aria is smack dab in the middle of it all. Trams to Monte Carlo, VDara, Bellagio with easy access to the Palace and Mirage; PH is right across the street. All the good shopping centers (Forum, Miracle Mile, Crystals) are within spitting distance (but don't do that because spitting is gross). It's pretty much prime real estate for the Vegas vet.\n\nI can see why design and layout might not appeal to everyone -- I love contemporary crap so Aria suits me just fine. Decor is sharp and modern without trying too hard or intruding on the experience, everything is clean and well-kept. The floor layout is incredibly well-thought out: all the eateries are on the back wall next to Elements (gift shop), pool and Starbucks are upstairs.\n\nWe love the pool and getting a cabana here is a must. Our party did it two days straight and I don't know if I can do without one if making the pool is a whole day affair. Cabanas are extremely well furnished (misters? high-five!) and stocked with treats, plus you get your own private server that checks in on you from time to time to bring you food or drinks off the menu. Not to mention the privacy -- easily the best part knowing you have your own lounging space all to yourselves and won't pass out next to a group of lovely ladies in a drunken stupor, only to wake up next to a hairy old dude in a Speedo smoking a crappy, nasty cigar. The pools themselves are clean from what I saw and temp is just right.\n\nRooms are 4-5 star quality and super plush and lush. Entire room controlled on a remote, badass bathrooms (one of the sweetest showers EVER) and the beds...my god, the beds. I'm seriously gonna get one when my current one kicks the bucket *note to self: set bed on fire after dinner* Extremely clean, all items were in excellent condition and working order -- zero complaints. By the way, stop housekeeping on your way out so you can stock up on some of those ridiculously divine chocolate packets. Staff is great: bellhops were perfect and efficient, concierge was helpful, pool staff is accommodating -- they even have guys standing around the hotel to help direct you to your destination or if you have a question.\n\nThis is by far one of my fav casinos -- offer the best Strip odds for a big hotel in blackjack and craps, circulation system is from another world because you can't smell any smoke (you can however, easily smell the pleasant signature vanilla scent), dealers\/boxmen\/stickmen are for the most part fun to play with. Loads of craps tables and usually have $10 min so I'm always there. I do hate the stupid electronic craps machine...god, how I hate that girl's voice. EVILLLL.\n\nWas sad to say goodbye, will be more than happy to say hi again. Love.
