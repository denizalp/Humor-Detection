Great social environment! I saw people here playing chess to just chilling alone on their laptops. I came here and no place to sit; sat by 3 strangers and became good friends with them at the end of the night. Great hookah, really affordable and really friendly staff. A high recommendation from me to anyone. There are lots of hookah lounges back in Cali., and this is probably better than more than half of the ones i go to back home. 5 stars! Will be coming back :).
