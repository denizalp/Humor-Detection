Like a large percent of people, I came in here because I'm a fan of the \"Tanked\" TV show on Animal Planet.\n\nI only recently started watching the show a few months ago, but became a fan right away and figured it would be cool to stop by and check out ATM since I'm out here in Vegas.  It was about 4pm, and I walked the main door trying to find out how to go about going on a Tour of the Facility though no one was sitting at the front desk...and I was hoping to meet the General.\n\nI then walked over next door to the ATM store and was immediately greeted by one of Wayde's Tabby cats who was laying down on the counter just relaxing.  There was a sight seeing tour inside and a large group of people were gathering around Wayde and his wife Heather to take pictures.  My girlfriend walked in shortly after and we too took a few snapshots with them.  I spoke with the Kings for a few minutes and they were really down to earth people (tried to figure out a fish pun here).  As were were chatting I could hear his Macaws in the back and I asked if it was okay to see the Birds.  He said there was a little hallway in the back where you could see them, but we were not allowed in the back as they were filming an Episode of Tanked.  The Birds were cool, and my girlfriend pointed out a cubicle in the back that had a bunch of Robbie Redneck's stuff.
