If I had to describe how a resort hotel should be, I would describe the Hospitality Suite Resort.\n\nThe room was huge, and perfect for our little family staycation.\n\nThe kitchen, while unused by us, was large enough to be able to cook and dine in the room, providing a four-burner stove, with oven, and an apartment sized refrigerator.\n\nThere was a bar in the room, with stools, perfect for making the kids feel grown up.\n\nThe bedroom was good sized, with a HUGE walk-in closet!\n\nThe pool bar has a free happy hour nightly, from 5 PM to 6:30 PM. We did not take advantage of it, but that's a really great way to keep the clientele happy.\n\nThe rooms come with complimentary hot breakfast, served at the adjacent J.J.'s Cantina restaurant. The choices for the hot breakfast were plentiful, including french toast, eggs and bacon\/sausage, etc. A great value-add, which more resort type hotels need to invest in.\n\nBeing there for the two days, I saw much more interaction between guests than I have seen in quite a while. While not everyone seeks that type of interaction, it's nice to see the environment not only allow for it, but encourage it, as I believe Hospitality Suite Resort does.\n\nThe counter staff were always friendly, helpful, smiling people, who perfectly represent the establishment.\n\nThe location is central to much of what there is to see and do in and around Scottsdale.\n\nThey offer free WiFi throughout the establishment, which is another value-add that not enough hotels, or even resorts, provide.\n\nIf I had visitors coming in from out of town, and staying more than one night, I would HIGHLY recommend Hospitality Suite Resort.\n\nI will definitely be keeping them in mind for my next staycation, as well. :)
