I am disappointed that my fellow Yelpers average a 3.5 stars because I loved this place.  The atmosphere is cozy, and the food was outstanding.  I had the Carnitas (real smoked flavor with a crunchy crust) and my mother had the Pollo con Espinacas (with a chipotle cream sauce to die for!).\n\nThe sangria was YUMMY as were the salsas.\n\nOK, OK, the service could have been better.  The server was fairly attentive, though I do not think he smiled at us once.  He must not have hurt my feelings too badly though because I am definitely going to return!
