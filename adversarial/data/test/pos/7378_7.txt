\"Expect Great Things,\"-Kohl's\n\nWhat a fitting tagline for a company like Kohl's. There is so much you can find at any of their stores and everything is marked moderately. However, when they have sales, they definitely go big on the their sales. You can find pretty much anything here and the ability to earn Kohl's Cash, a cool and popular incentive for every $100.00 you spend before tax you earned $10.00 in Kohl's Cash toward your next purchase. My family and I are constantly looking for the best bargain especially when you want to stay in fashion without breaking the bank.\nI get a lot of compliment from people whenever I get something from here. For those not familiar with Kohl's, because in Hawaii there is none and those living under a rock, LoL. The best way to describe Kohl's, it's like Macy's younger sibling that is budget minded but fashionable and modern. \n\nJust like they say, \"The more you know the more you Kohl's,\"-Kohl's.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #76
