Whenever I am in the mood to be a raging fat kid at lunch, this is my go to spot on Mill. Its seriously all disgustingly fattening, and all disgustingly delicious.. because usually, those two things go hand in hand. They've got the build your own burrito thing going on, which also applies for the tacos, nachos, quesadillas and tortas.. I usually get the carnitas burrito, with all my favorite fixings, and holy loaded burrito Batman, they do NOT skimp on the fillings. Its always too big to fit in my mouth, and always too big to finish the whole thing. Perfect for sharing. Today I tried the steak quesadilla, and on the side, just for fun, I decided to get the enchilada sauce for dipping. Its homemade, and perfect. Try this immediately. \n\nThe staff are awesome and wicked fun.. They also don't nickel and dime you for salsa & sauces like other burrito\/taco joints do. I hate it when that happens.\n\nThe best part about this place is that its not just a place to scarf down fatty deliciousness while widening your waist size, they also have a full bar with tons of different tequilas, extremely eclectic decor, the chandelier is my personal fave and they are really big supporters of saving the tata's. They sell coozies that advertise this and all proceeds go towards finding a cure for breast cancer. So basically, if you love Mexican food, booze, and boobs, this is where you need to be. \n\nmmm.
