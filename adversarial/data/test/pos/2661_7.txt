Talk about taking the Patio indoors! Not just Patio outdoor set but one that would see in the backyard of upscale home with some sweet landscape for accent. I heard about the concept but never imagine that it would be walking into this artsy outdoor patio vibe. The minute you walk in you see this swing set over fake grass and then off to the other side got cool two tables that literally cross your legs sit next to the table. Asian zen piece of mind theme for sure. The main area have bunch of booths but this amazing lighting above with patio covering of wood boards above. The most comfortable pillows that can lean back on. The decor all around is upscale feeling, elegant, and never think small restaurant outside the strip would put that much into the interior design. I love it! Also from the minute walk in with the music playing is really peaceful, calm, and not to loud can hang out talk stories with family or friends. \n\nThankfully came with some of my high school friends visiting so got to try few things on the menu. We all shared three desserts between the three of us. Thai Tea Honey Toast Custard, Speciality Hong Kong Waffle (Chocolate Chip Mint) with Homemade Banana Vanilla Ice Cream, and Coconut Cake. Every single one was truly amazing!! The Thai Tea Custard on top was was dreamy. Always been fan of Thai Tea especially if am having Thai food. It took the drink to another level. The custard was not overkill sweet, had all the characteristic of nice creamy custard, love love the color just like the drink nice light brown, and I could dip that custard on just about anything thinking fruit be out of control good. The honey toast was solid. The Hong Kong Waffles was different in presentation then other places been to. First they offer speciality ones or flavor waffles. The other places been never notice or recall then having flavors just the base. Here you have few options we ended up going with the Chocolate Chip Mint. Did not disappoint! It was mixed into the batter well and every piece could taste it. The Ice Cream ************MUST HAVE EVEN IF JUST GET ONE SCOOP ACTION********** all Homemade. They have few different flavors. We went with the Banana Vanilla. It was unreal good! First off you can taste that it homemade not mass produce. The balance of flavors of the banana and vanilla was on point. The perfect compliment with the waffle. The Coconut Cake was also amazing. It was light, moist, and the coconut flavor was perfect. It was the perfect haupia just in cake form. \n\nAll the plate they serve the food and drinks are upscale and fan. The honey toast it was shaped with piece of bread. Each one has the name logo on it. Personality for sure!!! The place screams it from the  minute you walked in for the first time. \n\nWe also ordered two speciality drinks. I tried the watermelon refresher. I was thinking might be way to sweet. It really was refreshing. No pun intended. It tasted like bunch of fresh cut watermelon blended and served. One of my friends order the Black Pea. I tried it. It was weird to me. Not fan. \n\nIf looking chill over coffee or drink with family  or friends. The Patio Desserts & Drinks is great spot!!
