Dave & Busters is like Vegas where you cannot win any money and there are no strippers.\n\nMy friend Martin had his birthday party here - I had never been before - the food was pretty good for a chain restaurant.  I had some tempura mushrooms with very good ranch dressing for dipping (and, if you think all ranch dressing is good, you are mistaken - I have had my fair share of disgusting ranch dressing.)  I also had teriyaki sirloin steak (bloody rare) with mashed potatoes that had a bunch of crap in them.  And, by crap I mean cheese, bacon and sour cream.  Very tasty.\n\nThe price was a little on the high side, but I think I expected that.\n\nThe games were fun to watch my friends play... I'm not very good at arcade games so I didn't bother to waste my money.  Though, I was a little peeved because when I went into the gift shop thingie there was this wicked cool *Darth Vader statuette which said \"I am your father\" and \"Don't underestimate the Force\" and \"I find your lack of faith disturbing\" when you pressed a button.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/adorkablegrrl\/1203839953\/\n\nI totally wanted that.\n\nDave & Busters are cheeseballs and wouldn't even entertain the notion of me offering them $20 for the dang thing... they wanted tickets.  But, by that time it was late and I was tired\/cranky and I didn't want to bother with trying to win 1,200 fucking tickets.\n\nAll in all a good evening, even if I am hugely disappointed that I didn't come home with Darth tonight.\n\n*They had a Yoda one, too... but, it was kinda lame.
