This store has an unwelcome attitude towards non-Hispanic customers. Worst of all, they sell fruits that are rotten from the inside. Having to take a lot of Biology and Chemistry classes for my major, I am quite aware of various chemical smell, particularly preservatives which I have noticed on their oranges. I wouldn't doubt that they actually inject formaldehyde into their meat as well, since that distinct, smell is present on their meat.
