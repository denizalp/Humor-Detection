I liked this place more than the guys in my group did.  We came here to try to catch a basketball game.  They have Pac 12 for all you college sports followers.  I noticed right away all the exceptionally hot waitresses dressed in lingerie here.  I guess they are normally dressed as sexy lumberjacks, but we stumbled in during lingerie week.  The atmosphere is your typical sports bar, with scantily clad servers.  There is a fire pit and a fireplace out in the patio.\n\nNot a big selection of food to choose from which is fine as long as its good.  I had the poblano chicken sandwich.  It was okay.  The fries were decent enough. I did enjoy my bloody mary and ordered a couple of those.  I love it when a bloody mary has bacon in it.\n\nI was honestly expecting poor service.  But our server was great.  She was super friendly and very efficient.  And yes she was hot.\n\nI actually had fun here, but then again, I did do a couple of shots.  Its pretty much an average place with above average looking girls.
