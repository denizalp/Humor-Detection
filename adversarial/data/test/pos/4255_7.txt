Where does a cat go when it loses its tail? A RETAIL store. Badum chhhhh. Welcome to a land of crazy cat lady kitsch with a purrfect selection of excellent coffee and tea. \n\nThis is one of those places that you've walked by for years and never gone into because...well, it doesn't look all that exciting from the outside. Give your Judgey McJudger self a kick in the pants, because you've been missing out.\n\nATMOSPHERE\n\nCat lady. All those cat trinkets that you see in the flea market or that remind you of your grandma? They're in here. Hanging out with some garden gnomes, waiting for winter to pass. I don't know if they change their decor around but the garden gnomes have taken up residence next to a lawnchair and umbrella on the astroturf above the door, just to remind you that you're not in Cuba. Don't question it. Nor the cat clocks on the wall, the cat quartz light, or the cat shaped salt and pepper shakers. Just don't. Just accept that you can has cheezburgers.\n\nWith six little adorable tables and two easy chairs, seating is good for two, three, possibly four at one table. Attempting a larger group? Hedge your bets and ask lady luck for some applaws.\n\nFOOD\n\nSurprisingly, all day breakfast is available for the peckish, along with sandwiches, homestyle muffins, cookies and pie, and a full rack of Kawartha premium ice cream. All the things you could really crave in a land of benign cat-tatorship. \n\nThe variety of coffee blends on call is surprising and I expect to go back to try some new light tasting flavours. \n\nThe tea selection is not as fancy as Ye Old Curiosity, but the bagged tea is nonetheless good quality with enough variety to give yours truly some pause. I ordered the dark blend tea bag that the owner said would mimic coffee without the caffeine. It did not taste like coffee, but neither did it taste like English Breakfast, Earl Grey, or Orange Pekoe. I liked it enough to inquire about the price, which was $10 for a box, a normal price for premium bagged tea. I will be back later to retrieve it. Oh, and he had soy milk for me, woohoo!\n \nSERVICE\n\nOne of the owners, who was charming and lovely to the children coming in for ice cream with Mum and with my party of two. A personable and considerate man who didn't hover but remained available if needed.\n\nLOCATION\n\nLocated off a side street on Markham Main Street, it isn't easy to see immediately, but don't judge Cat's Meow on its nondescript entrance. Not with Kawartha and Manitoulin Island jams and nut butters inside. Green P is plentiful if you can't find street parking. They also have a private lot. Accessible by viva purple with a less than ten minute walk from the corner of Markham Road and Highway 7.\n\nOVERALL\n\nCome for the delightfully kitsch atmosphere and a genuinely decent selection of cafe beverages. Forget Starbucks and curl up with a mewlicious brew at this hometown coffee haus.
