I think Batch is one of my favorite bakery in Madison.\n\nThey got me with the Chocolate Croissants and I stayed for... well everything else.\n\nYou can't go wrong, from their artisanal bread, pies, or pastries.\n\nThe chocolate croissant will always have a place in my heart. The croissant is so flaky, buttery, and golden and the chocolate inside taste like very high quality chocolate.\n\nThey do large orders for special events and cater weddings.\n\nCheck their website for their bread rotations!\n\nClosed Mondays.
