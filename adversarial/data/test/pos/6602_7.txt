Y'know, I have never actually been in this place as it always seems to be closed whenever I venture to the Sahs Syde, but every now and then, someone I know ends up getting pretzels from there for everyone, and they are always tasty either hot or cold. Today someone gave me a couple of the soft pretzel rods, so I figgered it was high time for a Yelp. \n\nMy father grew up in South Side, so the pretzels became a semi-regular treat for us. Once as a child, I was whining and carrying on about something I didn't wanna do or whatever while we were visiting my grandmother when she lived on Sarah Street.  So, to get me to shut up, my mom pulled over on Carson, came out with a brown paper bag, pulled out a South Side pretzel the size of Andre The Giant's hand, and stuffed it in my mouth with a big grin on her face. True story. That was the first time I ever had one; at age 6. There wasn't a peep outta me the rest of the day. \n\nHey, eatin' somethin' good is work when yer a kid. Ever hear rugrats carry on when they're eatin' a hot fudge sundae? Dig what I'm sayin'?\n\nI like to bite a chunk off and let it dissolve in my mouth a little. \n\nThese ain't the kind of pretzels you'll find at a department store's snack bar or a ball park concession stand. You don't get that pepper on the bottom, that oven baked flavor that bleeds character, care, and the old-school, that chewy toughness that evokes what South Side used to be; street as hell.
