+ Neighborhood coffee shop convenient for residents\n+ Menu includes regular, specialty, and blended drinks, & a few foods\n+ Location has a drive thru and local art \n+ Cozy atmosphere with books, games, and local publications\n\nWish this spot had a location closer to my side of town because I would definitely go. The Sweet and Spicy coffee drink was nice, something different. Their coconut specialty drink was comparable to the Kokomo at Dutch Bros.
