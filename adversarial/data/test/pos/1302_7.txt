You know how sometimes a place has such an impact on you that you start writing a review in your head as soon as you put something in your mouth? That happened and zero stars should be a thing.\n\nI decided to give this buffet a chance since a client had booked rooms for my coworker and I at Excalibur, and after getting up 6am for the flight and working until 7pm that day, we were both exhausted and didn't want to go very far for food. Big mistake. No matter how tired or hungry you think you are, you are NOT desperate enough to eat here. I would have preferred walking back to LA.\n\nThe selection was awful, all the meat was dry, the seafood looked sketchy enough that I was too scared of potential food poisoning to try anything, and a lot of items at the salad bar were browning. All I ended up eating was a couple bites of meat, one bite of potato gratin, and salad. Yes, this is cheap (only $22) but it's not even worth that. I wish I'd just gone hungry.
