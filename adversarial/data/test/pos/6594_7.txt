SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\nOrdered delivery tonight and first off after waiting for an hour and fifteen minutes I call to check the status of my order, the man on the phone said 15 minutes - i waited 25 and then called again and he said 2 minutes and hung up the phone on me. Yet the driver did not arrive for another 15 minutes. That is a total of nearly 2 hours. My normal place (which was closed tonight so I had to order from here) is normally there within 40 minutes - and a lot cheaper.\n\nAfter receiving the food it was warm, not hot, and a huge disappointment. General Tao is supposed to be crispy, this was soggy. Sweet and sour pork was bland and soggy as well - as were all the veggies in the cantonese chow mein and the house special rice was also very bland. \n\nNeedless to say, it definately deserves the 1 star it gets- the food was awful and for more expensive prices than I normally pay. I would not reccomend it nor will I be returning.
