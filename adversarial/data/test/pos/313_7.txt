One of my coworker\/friend lives here with her husband so I've been over here a few times. Ummmm WOW. WOW, WOW, WOW. Gorgeous views from every angle. I love the pool area (there are two, one on each tower's 37th floors) with the huge outdoor kitchens and hot tubs. \n\nAlthough I don't like the utilitarian concrete modern design of the place, this place is so swank. My favorite area is the residential lounge with the big screen and pool table and movie viewing room. We had a 4th of July party in here and the views were great for viewing fireworks over the valley. The gym is spectacular with a sauna and a steam room in the locker room. \n\nAs for the condos, my friend lives in a studio for a whopping discounted price of $900 because her husband works for City Center. They usually go for $1,400 and it is SO tiny. My very large dorm room was only slightly smaller than this. The places come furnished which is an upside, and the amenities are great, but they should be for the astronomical prices they charge (In Vegas, you could get something really huge for $1,400\/month because our housing market is trashed.) \n\nDesk guys are nice and were able to send people up in a quick second to help us navigate the TV systems upstairs and concierge got me band-aids when I cut open my finger upstairs on a food container. I'm pretty sure any other condo front desk people would have laughed if we had called for a band-aid.\n\n Security is great here, you have to have a key fob to get in or use the elevators or get into anything on the 37th floor. That's great so you don't have crazies wandering in from outside. Valet is a breeze and they're very friendly. It's so convenient to just drive from Harmon, crossing LV Blvd. right into the entrance for Aria\/Crystals\/Veer's parking garages.  \n\nIf I was having to live in the dorms at UNLV, I'd for sure just get a place here because the dorms are more expensive than a studio here. This place is super swank.
