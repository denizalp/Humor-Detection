I got to say I don't know what the hoopla is about this place. My friend told me about a little hole in the wall Mexican joint that was \"amazing\" called Carolinas. He told me to get there early for lunch because the line ends up out the door for the rush. This is the information I had and I was stoked to get lunch at a hidden gem in Phoenix that had \"amazing\" Mexican food. I walked into this this little dirty building, everything was old, but it smelled pretty good. I overlooked the cleanliness because of the things I've heard... I ordered a shredded beef chimichangas and my father in law got a carne asada burrito. After a few bites... I felt nothing... I felt like I had been kicked in the sweet spot, or just learned that Santa was not real, or like the Easter bunny was my parents, or that  in fact my ass does look fat in my favorite jeans... I felt lied, deceived, hurt all at the same time. The food was mediocre at best... then it hit me, i'm eating a mediocre chimichanga in a dirty building! I felt like I had left my morals at the door for what I thought was going to be the best Mexican food IN THE WORLD! All I know is my mom and dad would have been disappointed in me for continuing to eat this poor excuse of a chimi, but the would understand seeing as I couldn't return it... The guy that recommended this place and I are no longer friends... Because with friends like that who needs enemies!!! HA!
