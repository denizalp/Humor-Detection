We first visited the Mustard Museum at least 5 years ago when it was in Mt. Horeb. In fact, we did not realize that the museum had moved to Middleton till we got to Mt. Horeb and could no longer find it.  Once we realized our error, we headed up to Middleton and found an even bigger and better Mustard Museum.\n\nIt is really cool to see such dedication to one condiment. They have a small theater that shows a continuous loop documentary about the history of mustard. It was narrated by Edward Woodward (Star of the Equalizer). The theater is called \"Mustardpiece Theater\". That kind of sums up the feel of the place, LOL.\n\nWe toured the place and then did a mustard tasting. That was a lot of fun and needless to say we made several purchases. A mustard lover (like moi) could go nuts in that place. Everyone was friendly and it was just a lot of fun. The best part is our cupboards are now stocked with all kinds of mustard. \n\nThis place is fun for all ages. (Well, maybe not real small kids). It is interesting, educational, quirky and kitchy, i.e. the best of all worlds.
