Yuzu is an interesting little place. \n\nIt's an Izakaya inspired bar. Don't worry, I didn't know what that was either. It's an informal type of Japanese gastropub. The concept alone is enough to check it out! \n\nMy friend and I stopped in for lunch, and to my surprise, it was pretty quiet! I loved the open, community style seating with rustic accents. They also have a small little patio with umbrellas where you can enjoy a beer. My friend and I went with a Platform ale from their extensive drink list, and I settled on the fried chicken skewer and thai bowl. The chicken on that baby was sooo mouthwatering. \n\nThe staff was super welcoming, and they have a private parking lot, which totally rules. On my next return, I'll probably come for dinner and split a bunch of yummy skewers with my table! I think that's the best way to go.
