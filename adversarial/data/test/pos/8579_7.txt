I've been here about three times total. The first two times were to meet friends for drinks only which were great. I have no qualms about their bar. Today was the first time I came to eat. I arrived with my husband and two friends. I was on a time crunch since I had to get back to work in 40 minutes but the other three had more time to spare. I made my waitress aware of that and that I would need a to go box when the meal arrived so I could make a quick exit. I am fully aware that I am a really picky eater. I ordered a taco salad which listed that it came with beans, guacamole, and sour cream. When I ordered it,  I asked for the salad with the ground beef, no sour cream, no beans, and guacamole on the side. About five minutes before I had to leave I received my salad with no to go box, no beef, and olives. First off, if you're going to put a description of what's in the salad, why don't you put EVERYTHING? If I had known there were going to be olives, I would've asked for no olives. Then I had to ask for the beef again which left me asking my husband to bring the meal into me at work. That was the end of my personal experience inside the restaurant. When he brought it to me, he proceeded to tell me when there were two cups of beef. When the first one was brought out, the meat barely covered the bottom of the cup. He then told the waitress that was not acceptable for that size of a salad. She said she could bring another one out but it would be 15 minutes. When I finally did get to eat it (about an hour later) I was severely disappointed. Here's the total breakdown: five minutes picking out olives, 1 minute putting out flavorless beef, two minutes eating a soggy salad with an even soggier shell (I get it, it was an hour later, that can't be helped), one minute to really say that salad was crap, 20 seconds to walk to the trash can and throw 3\/4th of the salad away. I honestly wish I took the extra steps and walked to Chipotle.
