Came in for dinner but ended up staying for just an appetizer. \n\nIt is a very nice intimate dinner spot. Great place for a nice quiet date. Outdoor and indoor seating. Large bar and dining area.\n\nAt first glance I was interested in having dinner but after re-reading the menu and talking to the waiter it wasn't the place for me. I like great food just like anyone else but this place was just too fancy for me. We decided to order an appetizer the steak tartare. The presentation was beautiful served in a small metal pot with an egg yolk on top. The pot was sitting on a platter with toasted bread triangles and pickled veggies. It was light and tasted fabulous. The taste is hard for me to describe. \n\nAlex our waiter was wonderful. He greeted us and told us the specials for the evening. He answered the questions I had and made sure we were content. I felt bad for leaving. He let us know that people often come in just for an appetizer or just for dessert. He always had a smile and made me feel less awkward. \n\nThe bill was a little over $20.00. The app and service was worth the price. \n\nIf you are into fancy French food this is the spot. Too bad I'm not more adventurous otherwise I would have stayed.
