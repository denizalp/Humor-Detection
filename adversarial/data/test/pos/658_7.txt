Super quaint, local spot and definitely a hidden gem! Located behind a gas station on the corner of Sunset and Valle Verde. I honestly thought it was going to be a nasty dinky bar inside but it wasn't. Yes, there is a bit of smoke sometimes when it is super crowded but not as bad as any other bar or small casino.\n\nTheir food is amazing though. The buffalo wings are a MUST! They are super meaty and flavorful. The fries are steak fries and delicious. I love that they give you a big side of ranch or blue cheese with your order. The portions are big and the prices are really affordable.\n\nStaff is always nice and friendly and quick to have your drinks ordered. The beer is always nice and cold. Make sure you try their beer which is owned by Ellis Island Brewery, it is very crisp and refreshing.
