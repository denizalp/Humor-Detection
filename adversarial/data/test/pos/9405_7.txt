Not sure what people dig about this place.  The food was bland and it took forever.  If you like goat cheese though, you may like this place.  They put goat cheese on a lot of items.  Maybe they are milking a goat in the back.\n\nPretty crowded though so they are probably doing something right for someone.  I like the fresh juice option and the fact that the menu has some lighter items with the nutrition listed.  Although I'm pretty sure some of the nutritional information was wrong.  On what planet does a mixed green salad fat-free balsamic have 100 calories but 3.5 g of fat and a grilled vegetable salad with the same dressing have 159 calories and only 0.5 g of fat.  So dieter beware.
