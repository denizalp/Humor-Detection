Okay guys all I ordered was a Thai Iced Tea ($2.95). My husband got the Taro smoothie with boba ($3.55). It was around 9PM when we walked in and the restaurant closes at 9:30PM. I was expecting a little backlash but the cashier didn't say a peep. For people who live in Northwest Las Vegas, finding a Boba spot that's open after 8PM can be extremely challenging. After a Yelp search, China One popped up as an attractive option. Granted, the drink options are limited (I think there's only 5 choices) but we were just happy to get our tea\/boba fix. The Thai Tea was super sweet and refreshing and my husband was enamored by the Taro smoothie, which actually came out of a slushie machine. The employee brought the drinks to our table and wished us a good night as we left. Would we come back? If we ever have a late night hankering for Boba, we'll be back.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #156
