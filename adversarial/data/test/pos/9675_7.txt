I will amend my statement to say they \"tried\" to over charge me by charging \"master stylist\" price for someone who was not deemed a master stylist by them. When I questioned it they amended the charge. They have been harassing me via phone and email to amend my review which I think is ridiculous. They called my home and complained to my mother of all people to persuade me to remove the poor review. Not very professional and further solidifying my original perception.
