Best BBQ in Las Vegas\n\nThis spot is as authentic as you get for Southern BBQ. I'm hooked! This place has a fun atmosphere and is family friendly. The staff had impressive customer service skills. \n\nFor appetizers we started with the BBQ pork nachos topped with chopped green onions, sharp cheddar cheese and jalapeño cream. \nI had to try the bacon wrapped meatballs called \"Moinks\" once I saw it on the menu,\nserved with jalapeño slaw mixed with garlic ontop of cheddar cheese toast. We also had crab fritters served with roasted garlic tarter sauce, marinated shallots and tomatoes. \n\nFor the entrée we had the 'Lord Have Mercy' which consisted of delicious 1\/2lb chicken, 6 bones mopped baby back ribs, 6 bones dry rubbed spareribs, absolutely succulent Carolina pulled pork and 4 Louisiana hot links. \nI tried all of the house sauces and was extremely impressed with each one.\n\nWe had green beans, creamy macaroni and cheese, garlic fries and rice and beans. \n\nDefinitely will be back.
