Back in 2011, I stayed at the South Point Casino a lot.  What came with my stay was a coupon voucher to enjoy a good meal at Primarily Prime Rib.  Those were the days and I dined here more than I can remember. It's been years since I've dined here and it's still the same.  The service is great, the prices will not burn a hole in your pocket, and the food is pretty good.  When my bosses are in town, they prefer to come here for their prime rib.  These guys have no limit to how much they can spend for dinner.  And yet, they still choose to come here. They love Primarily Prime Rib for primarily the prime rib. I'm not a prime rib type of guy and only tried it once. What I enjoy at Primarily Prime Rib is their Steak Medallions, Salmon, and Baked Potato.  This has been my exact meal the last 3 times I've been here.  The Steak Medallions and Salmon together is currently not on the menu.  However, if you ask your server, they'll usually hook up this Surf n' Turf for a small additional price.  The salmon is flaky just how I like it and not fishy at all. The medallions combined with their mushroom glaze is really good and I recommend it. It's almost guaranteed that I will be coming here when the bosses are in town. Heck, I was just here last night. \n\n2017 Yelp Review #79
