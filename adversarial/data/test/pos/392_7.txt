One of my very favorite places on the planet, and one that I would miss from the bottom of my cold black soul if I ever moved away.  I've been going to Last Chance for 12 years now, and it has seen me through college, crappy jobs, graduate school, my first real job, and many pants sizes.  Even now that I can afford to pay retail -- I can't stop going.  Why pay $120 for those velour Juicy cargo pants, when I can pay 29.90?  And at that price, I can get them in three colors!   I haven't paid full price for sneakers in forever.   While there is much sifting through trashed, worn out stuff, enduring the shrill screaming of numerous poorly behaved children, and strategically avoiding the shriveled up batty old Last Chance hawks (who resell everything on eBay)  the $19 black cashmere long sleeve t shirt I got last time was worth every second.
