The High Roller. A person you'd like to know or a cool ride. Ours started out a little bumpy with some false advertising... but Mariah was kind enough to fix us up after I protested the bad wording on their advertising. Seriously, hire some new people to write those things because that was bullshittery at its finest. \n\nAnyhoodle, after she was kind enough to fix our problem, we grabbed drinks in the skylounge and went up in the giant ferris wheel type thingie. You step into a little air conditioned pod. Actually, not that little. You could get a good sized group in there. I'd check for a groupon though or similar because the ride itself is kind of boring. They put some weird serial killer looking guy on the screen and he tries to be funny but it falls weirdly short. Also, it's hard to hear. \n\nI'd do this again for $20 if it included a drink. I would not do this for their asking price. Make sure you get the senior or the military discount as well. The folks at the re-seller stands won't offer that.
