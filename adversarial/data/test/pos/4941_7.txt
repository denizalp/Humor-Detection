My best friend introduced me to this nail salon back in the day. I stopped going when my favorite manicurist at the time, Cindy and her daughter who owned the salon sold it and moved to California. I have been going back now for about 3 months and I must say the new owner Mary and her husband are doing a wonderful job. There is one lady still there from when Cindy owned the salon, I don't remember her name unfortunatley. She is very good also she does my mom's nails and pedicure. They have made nice improvements to the salon. It is always very peaceful and relaxing, and very clean. Everyone is always really friendly and nice and do a beautiful job. I have always left pleased. I personally go to Leanne she is wonderful. My best friend moved to California and when she comes to visit, she still gets her nails done with me here.
