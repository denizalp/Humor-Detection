All I have to say is the owner, Antonio, (Anthony when he's out of character) the Tex-Mex tyrant with the cowboy hat, is the biggest A-hole in Cleveland and quite possibly the entire world. Im just dumbfounded that someone as arrogant, rude, and aggressive as he is can have a quasi-successful restaurant.  I wish him and his restaurant nothing but the worst because that would be due karma for him. If at all possible find somewhere else to eat. Do not support this man, he's not worthy of your time and money.
