Visiting Las Vegas to relax enjoy good food gamble and see great shows. Unfortunately dining at this restaurant ruined all of that. \n\nWe are from New Orleans where you are allowed to carry your drinks outside of your present venue as long as it's in a plastic container no glass allowed. This is the same in Las Vegas so restaurant expect you might have a leftover drinks from the previous venue ( Bar or gambling floor)\n\nHaving chosen to dine here because of the reviews of excellent food before seeing the show KA. My daughter and I were shown to the bar seating not a table which fine giving a nice view of the food being prepared we both had cups of wine from a earlier happy hour when we were seated ( if this is prohibited by the restaurant the hostess will  politely ask you to finish your drink before seating you) nothing was said and we were seated.\n\nMenus were brought and beverage choices were inquired we asked for a wine menu planning on purchasing a bottle while we dined but didn't after we were told they had no way for us to take the unfinished amount with us ( no togo cups or taking the glass bottle re-corked.)\n\nI ordered a 3 course dinner and my daughter having eaten prior to meeting me for the show ordered a small plate totaling $135.00. We then decided to take turns gambling in the casino while the food was being prepared because of time constraints of showtime within the hour and not wanting to both disappear at the same time leaving a deserted dining area. My daughter came back Shortly after having no luck gaming with another small togo cup from a drink purchased on her way to the casino floor I then went to try my luck fortunately I was luckier than her and had to cash the ticket. \n\nMeanwhile the appetizer had arrived so she phoned me to let me know as I was reentering the restaurant I was accosted rudely by the manager stating I'm not allowed to go outside the restaurant to bring drinks which I hadn't it was inadvertently an unfinished drink from the gaming floor he was so rude if I hadn't had food ready and waiting on the table I would have walked out.\n\nI've been in the service industry over 20 years as a restaurant manager it's called a SERVICE industry for a reason! I Would never have treated a guest in this way It completely upset me to the point I couldn't enjoy any of the food and ruined any enjoyment I had of the show KA because I was still upset about his rudeness.\n\nI did call the manager back after I finish my meal to tell him how upset I was by his rudeness he then accused me of being drunk and that I should be charged for a corking fee for the unfinished drink I brought into his restaurant.\n\n1: I'm disabled I use a cane and have a service dog.So I cannot sit down or stand well and I'm always unsteady. I chose my daughters assistance this evening instead of these aids so having her help me to sit and stand does not Constitute someone being drunk.\n2: The reason for that togo  cups is because I do not slam alcohol one drink will last me an hour I sip it and enjoy my wine.\n3: Corking fees or for bottles not for 2 ounces left in a cup from a previous venue if I had been informed I would have finished it before entering the restaurant and being accosted rudely.\n\nI also see from some of the other reviewers the manger is a problem maybe some sensitivity training would help. So he Doesn't ruin someone else's evening when they're on vacation or just out to dine at a fine restaurant.\n\nWe are here after all to relax have fine food gamble and enjoy the shows
