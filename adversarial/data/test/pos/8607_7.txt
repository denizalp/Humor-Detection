I hired them for my wedding. I should have seen the red flag when I kept calling for a mock set up and they kept postponing. There was even a time I called and it was the owner, Ana, who answered and pretended that she was not there! I already knew her voice and yet she kept saying Ana was not there. I finally got a mock appt, I rented out the linens and chairs and when I got there she did not make one sample! On my wedding day they were late! My guests had arrived and they were still setting up the ceremony. She was not able to put up the flowers at the gazebo cuz she said the hooks were coming off. She should have checked the site beforehand! I let that one go and then at the reception I noticed the ceiling was so bare. She did not put the swag as we agreed upon. Again she blamed it on the venue because they told her they don't provide the posts. I had to hold off guests at the ceremony because she was not done with the centerpieces! Ana said she was there at 230pm but nobody, not even my coordinator saw her or anyone from her team at the venue. My dad even had to pick up the bouquets and corsages because she said she could not deliver them early at the hotel. The swag at the reception was the reason why I picked the venueand she totally ruined my dream wedding! She kept saying my venue was unprofessional when she herself failed to do a lot of things on the contract. It was her responsibility to know what she needed for set up. She has nobody to blame but herself. If I had known she would ruin my wedding like this I would have gone elsewhere! She made me a box for cards and gifts. It was originallly white and she said she can paint in silver to match our theme. the paint was so terrible it looked like somebody smothered the box with grey dirt! My nephew could have done a better job! save your money and find another florist!
