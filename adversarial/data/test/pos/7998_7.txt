Yorkdale Mall is the accumulation of all the bad ideas realized.\nIt's like every designer had a chance see their input come to fruition, which must have been the most diplomatic process ever in architectural design. Truly a mess among messes. \n\nThe current Yorkdale has seen itself evolve from a typical North American sleaze concrete box, to a less sleazier concrete maze. Whoever thought it was a good idea to situate a mall as big as Yorkdale next to two highways must have thought: \"The traffic will contribute to our businesses!\" What really happened is that the businesses have contributed to the traffic. People mostly can most agree on the atrocious parking, but personally I don't have a problem with it. The issue with parking is that everyone wants to park on the North East side, I never had problem finding parking on the West side, or their supposed valet which no attendant has ever been seen at. \nThe real problem is that there are only two real exits from the parking lot, the other exits only leads to roads which eventually end up at the two said exits. Toronto is world renowned for bad urban planning, but even for Toronto this is quite ridiculous! \n\nThe main entrance to the mall is the prettiest, and unless you enter from there, its almost like not coming here at all, which is why the parking is bad. The main entrance leads to an indoor imitation street where the stores look like buildings from the outside, wasting valuable ceiling space which could be better utilized to house more stores--not that this place needs more stores. The newly renovated food-court is so bloody ugly! They even have a small terrace which overlooks that iconic Canadian no-roof concept for all commercial buildings. If you enjoy looking at gravel, you'll love this place!\n\nIn my opinion, there are only a handful of stores that stand out. The Bay is perhaps the best anywhere in Toronto, with the prettiest make-up retail stations, multiple floors well organized to separate the departments, and plenty of staff available to service the customers. \nThe Cartier here is the best serviced Cartier anywhere within the GTA. It is light years ahead of the atrociously mannered staff in Yorkville, and I've been able to develop a relationship with the salesgirls here upon my first visit. The selection is disappointing with any selection found in Toronto, but that just goes with living in this city.\n\nYorkdale is packed on weekends, it is the only mall outside of Eaton Centre where it is not dominated by one category or age specific group. Everybody from every genre of subculture find themselves here, because simply the plethora of stores covers just about all of the clientele. You will find Tiffany's, Holt Renfrew, Harry Rosen at one end, to Zara, H&M, Sephora at the opposite end, and even a Young Drivers\/Collision Free somewhere hidden here. There is even a Tesla Motors dealership where you can buy a freaking car in a store the size of a Tim Horton's! See what I mean about bad ideas?\nI wonder what that meeting must have been like; \n\"I want to be able to buy diamonds!\"\n\"I want to be able to eat sushi!\"\n\"I want to buy cars!\"\n\"Okay okay, everybody settle down! Everyone gets one wish!\"\nTo be honest, my favourite thing about Yorkdale is the clean washrooms. It's always clean, not something found typically in malls. \n\nIf you have any inquiries at the Guest Services, look for the beautiful Jamaican lady with the glasses, she is super helpful and polite. \nHer co-worker on the other hand, some bald gino looking dude who apparently suffers from a medical condition that forces him to fix the button on his off-the-rack suit jacket every two second--who is there only to serve as an example on how not to shave your facial hair. I asked where the loo was, and he replied me disapprovingly; \"The LOO?\" Not answering the question. \nYeah, you know, short for lavatory? English, do you speak it?\nWhen it said 'Guest Services', I had no idea translation was in the package. \nHow industrious! \nI wonder what he tells people when he is asked the question; \"What do you do?\"\nDoes he pause, fix his button, rub that joke of a goatee, and tells some tall tale of associating his kiosk clerk position to somehow being a employee of Cadillac Fairview? Is it in his job description to judge the visitors of the mall? Clearly this man is too good to work here. We must find a fitting role for this man's finger pointing talents!\n\nYorkdale emphasizes on the fabulousity of the lifestyle they somehow portray in their advertising. There are regularly televised events held in the corridors. \nSorry Yorkdale; fabulous people don't shop in malls, and fabulous lifestyles is not defined by shopping, certainly not shopping at global chained brands. \nYawn.
