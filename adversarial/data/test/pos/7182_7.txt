5 stars!!!! Excellent Service! \n\nI adore Morocco, Spain and Moorish architecture and had been feeling a little nostalgic for it. The Montelucia is a little slice of Andalusia in upscale Scottsdale, AZ. There are architectural nods to Granada, the Alhambra, Sevilla, Cordoba and Marrakech. Exquisite venue for a decadent, relaxing escape and quite romantic as well. \n\nFrom arrival to departure. Service was five stars. We arrived quite disheveled in a Prius packed full of bikes and climbing gear. We had just driven in 5 hours from California. We left Cali at 3am and then had an epic morning of mountain biking  north of Phoenix in Black Canyon in inclement weather before arriving at the resort. The valet staff was gracious and accommodating considering our car's burly state and our less than pristine appearance.  \n\nThe little blond girl checking us in could have been a little more personable and warmer. She seemed pre-occupied reading the notes that were on our reservation as she rattled off the details of our stay. It was unexpected and appreciated that our stay was upgraded but she took a little fun out of it. I was incredibly excited to stay at the Montelucia and was eagerly anticipating exploring the resort. I was telling her about our plans for the evening and she listened politely albeit pre-occupied which leads to say disinterested.I guess I was just bummed that my enthusiasm for the resort and our stay wasn't matched by her enthusiasm. \n\nBut after that. Everything was well again. As we walked to our room many of the employees made eye contact, and acknowledged us and one lady even just randomly thanked us for staying at the Montelucia. It was nice to be appreciated as guests. It's just expected at a resort of this level to have that type of acknowledgement as it is what distinguishes them as the best of the best. \n\nA few minutes after check in the front desk called to make sure our room was to our liking. It was a gorgeous room with a romantic bathroom that had a free standing bath and fancy shower. We had a room with a view of the adult's only pool and a view of camelback mountain. It was lovely. As we were half naked  in the process of changing dress to hit the hot tubs we received a knock on the door which took us a while to answer and we were surprised to receive a delivery of cupcakes with Happy Birthday written on the plate and a personalized note from the management. I think the staff member that did the delivery thought we might have been in the middle of hanky panky and he hurriedly and politely put down the delivery but rushed out the door without us being able to give him a tip. He did tell us his name so we could find him later and thank him for the delivery. \n\nWe had a good chuckle and I loved and appreciated his professionalism. I love the thoughtfulness of the resort even more to take the extra step and acknowledge my birthday. That little gesture shows the level of care that the resort has for it's guest during their stay. \n\nI can't recommend the Montelucia highly enough to those that are staying in Scottsdale. It's a beautiful venue in a gorgeous setting, staffed by people who excel  in the business of luxury service.
