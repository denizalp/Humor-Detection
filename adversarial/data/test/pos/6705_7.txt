Do not go to this hospital or bring any of your loved ones here. My dad was admitted through the ER for a blood infection. While there he developed stage IV bed wounds because they did not properly rotate him, and they ignored him. Bed wounds are completely preventable and can kill your loved ones. I have shown pictures of his wounds to other health care professionals and they have all said the wounds are some of the worst wounds they have ever seen. In fact, because of the severity of my dad's wounds (some exposed to the bone) they will never heal and his foot is rotted to the point of saving. He is left in severe pain with limited mobility because of it. \n\nThey did not give him proper physical therapy and their neglect to keep the booties on his feet have resulted in drop foot. He will never be able to walk again or sit up. He is completely disabled now. \n\nAfter two months he left the facility unable to eat ever again and having to use a feeding tube. Subsequent doctors have pointed to a poorly done tracheotomy or a botched spinal surgery, that many question why that was performed. \n\nThe medical decisions were poor and they were horrible about keeping me updated. The nursing staff in general is horrible and rude. I restricted visitors because someone had come in while my dad was unable to talk and claimed they were his sister (he is an only child). But instead of restricting visitors, they allowed anyone in putting my father at risk.\n\nAccording to my dad, when the hospital staff thought he was out of it, they would come in his room hang out and take breaks. He also said he saw them taking his medicine. The nurses rarely passed on pertinent information not properly notate information for the next nurse shift. I had to call every new nurse and give them information necessary to help my dad. I had to make all the medical decisions for him and the doctors wouldn't even call me to give me the necessary information. To make a decision for him. \n\nThe nurses would leave my dad in his urine and feces for hours. And the hospital itself was dirt and careless. My dad ended up getting sick often from cross room contamination. \n\nThe doctors never followed up on him, which made his post-Spring Valley Hospital treatment further debilitating. \n\nSince his discharge, my dad has been moved around to more than 7 different hospitals multiple times, and every single one of them deserves a bad review, but none more so than Spring Valley Hospital who chewed my dad up, took his money, and spit him out. The whole Southern Nevada health care system is seriously bad and in low quality with horrible care. \n\nBy the way, I have had several lawyers who would like to file a medical malpractice suit and I have several friends that are nurses and doctors that are horrified with this hospital.
