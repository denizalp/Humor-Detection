Wide varieties of beers from ales to lagers to stouts and sours.   If you can't find a beer that you enjoy here, you're not trying hard enough.\n\nCame here one afternoon and had their meat flatbread which was really delicious.  My friends had sandwiches which they also liked and the table next to us enjoyed their charcuterie plate.\n\nThe beer here is well crafted and unique and it pairs nicely with the food they have on offer.\n\nThis place is a must visit when in Montreal.   I've been here on a Saturday night and it is packed so get there early.
