QT is the best.  Hands down.  Forget about Wawa, or any of the other coast's stations.  QT is is it, and I'm not just saying this because I grew up in Tulsa.\n\nI come into this one almost every day to grab cheap gallon waters, cheap breakfast sausage hot dogs, and cheap energy drinks, and the staff there is cool and knows me on sight.  \n\nThis location is in a bit of a rough patch of Scottsdale road, so you have to deal with bums sitting on the curb outside but if they are annoying customers, the staff will tell them to leave.  That's more an issue with this specific location than anything.\n\nPS: The woman below leaving QT one star because she's fat and can't stop eating gas station food is a moron.
