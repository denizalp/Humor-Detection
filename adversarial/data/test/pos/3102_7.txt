This is a tourist joint.  Plain and simple. The food that is so incredibly boring that if you told me that it was trucked in from a chain restaurant in upstate NY I would not be surprised.  The drinks, although uninspired, are served by universally attractive tip magnets.  The singular vibe of this place is \"Where are we gonna go next?\"\n\nIf you're a tourist, and you are intent on avoiding all of the amazing food and atmosphere this amazing city has to offer, then by all means - camp out here for the duration of your stay.
