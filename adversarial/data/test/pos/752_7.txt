It's like I stepped back in time, in a very good way.\n\nAccording to our Southwest in flight magazine, Spirit, this is one of the best steakhouses in the US.  I'm glad I got to try it!\n\nI had the prime rib [http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jZ8ogksrNzUmREJggc1YOQ?select=uhk-7dQUEY6biQk7i8zZ7g] and the others had the filet mignon ceasar [http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jZ8ogksrNzUmREJggc1YOQ?select=sFNlHqzPuqrBhvNkCxUD6Q].\n\nThe prime rib came out perfectly.  Juicy, tender, extra au jus sauce for the dipping.  No complaints!\n\nThe filet mignon came out a bit overdone, I've been told.  Order down!
