This is a waste of space. Seriously, it's a waste of space. In a neighbourhood where every single acre is worth more than an entire life's savings, Hazelton Lanes is a classic example of inefficient use of space. This place is huge, yet the interior is so, so empty. Yes, there's a Whole Foods...And a bunch of other stores. But you could cut the property in half and still squeeze all those stores together. With the extra space, you could create a huge garden or a picnic area or a cell for all the pretentious meanies of Yorkville who refuse to step aside for you when you're walking on the sidewalk. (Yes, I'm slightly bitter. I've worked in this neighbourhood for the past two years and never in my life have I come across so many rude and unhappy people. I guess you can't buy class.) The interior is also incredibly depressing. When you walk in you instantly feel lost in a hallway that feels emptier than the devil's heart.\n\nHazelton Lanes gets one star for their lounge area. Inside, you can sit at the many tables or on the many cozy chairs, open up your laptop, and write Yelp reviews on their wifi. Thanks, Hazelton!
