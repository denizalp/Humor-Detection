Much better experience at this location than the one by UMC on Charleston- went in with a 3:15 appointment and was out by 3:30. Staff was mostly friendly, made small talk and quickly took care of my blood draw. Location clean and neat.\n\nOnly turn off was the first employee I encountered, who took one look at me and told another employee \"you're up!\" to take care of me, and then went to talk with another employee even though the lady she told to help me was clearly busy with paperwork. As I left, first employee was in the waiting room watching the TV tuned to Ellen. If this is a pattern for her, perhaps she should be let go.\n\nProps for not wrapping my arm in that god-awful sticky tape that takes two showers to remove the film from my skin.
