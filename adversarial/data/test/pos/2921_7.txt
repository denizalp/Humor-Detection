Kids at Heart Gala was at the Children's Museum of Phoenix last Saturday night and Yelp was the sponsor of the after party, which kicked off at 9:30 and ended, well I can't tell you when it ended I lost my shoe at midnight and had to ride the pumpkin away,,,,but when I left the after party was rocking!\n\nThere were tons of highlights of this party, from performers on the floor dancing with the people, to the snow cone martinis, lip print readings, photo booths, face painting Yelp red couches and so much more!  \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting the owner Never Enough Sugar and trying a cupcake or 2 and made my way over to Jacked Ice, liquor infused shaved iced.  I am not an ice cream type of person, but they made me a cake batter martini and I was hooked! Shaved ice, cherry, white chocolate & cake vodka, it was soo soo good! There were plenty of food & drink offerings galore. \n\nMusic was playing bodies were moving, everyone was having a great time!  I did feel like Cinderella at the ball! Such a fun night!
