We went here while on vacation. An hour wait for food and Amy was sitting out front on her smartphone for at least 20 minutes after we ordered. Apparently her facebook was more important than cooking our food. We heard her yelling at someone in the back for an extended period of time, I'm pretty sure she fired someone as a young server came out crying.\n\nPathetic owner and business.
