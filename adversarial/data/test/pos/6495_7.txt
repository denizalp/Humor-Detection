I so enjoy Yogurt and Yogurtland is one of my favorite places to get yogurt in Vegas.  The fun flavors of Yogurt and the fact the rotate flavors so that you can get something different each time you come in - sweet!  We had a Salted Carmel Pretzel flavor on our last visit that was just awesome.  The coffee flavor was also very good. \n   What truly makes Yogurtland so special is the topping selection.  They have something for everyone.  With the wife it is always about adding more nuts than Yogurt.  For me nuts and the mini peanut butter cups make me creation perfect.  The daughter does the bubble things and gummies to achieve her dessert perfection.  \n   The interior is bright and inviting.  There is plenty of seating so you can enjoy your Yogurt  there or lid it up to take home.  They keep the place very clean and are constantly wiping down.  The employees are always friendly and their customer service is spot on.  The prices are fair and well worth the cost for your customized confection.  I am already looking forward to my next visit to Yogurtland.
