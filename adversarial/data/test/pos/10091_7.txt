Expensive delicacies are served here.  Honestly though, (for the price) I felt the products should be better.  The presentation of the desserts was fabulous.  Unfortunately, they looked better than they tasted.  A-Ok best describes what we've gotten here.\n\nOn the positive side, the Chocolate Fountain is very cool!  It is worth coming here just to check it out.  I would have to give this masterpiece 5 stars.\n\nAlso, my niece absolutely loves the place.  She says that the crepes are the very best that she has ever tried.  I would have to disagree.\n\nSo, although, she would give them 5 stars overall.  I'm writing the review so only 3 stars from me.\n\nWill I continue to return here?  Yes, because it's always cool to see the largest Chocolate Fountain in the world.  As for the bakery items....Hmm...one of these days I'll probably try something that simply \"Wows\" me.  Until that time, only 3 stars.
