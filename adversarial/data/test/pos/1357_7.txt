Unfortunately Yelp only allows me to leave one star instead of zero. My friends and I came into Billy's tonight on a Friday night and it was completely empty. I spent over $30 on a meal that was soggy and the meat was dried out. It felt like I spent money on cafeteria food, I could've gone to KFC and got more for my money. I will never come back again.
