The pool at the Trump is really nice.  I had to go to Vegas for work,  which is OK by me.  I am not big into casinos,  so the Trump was good on that front.   The lobby is beautiful and the staff is very professional. \nMy suite was beautiful and the bathroom was quite large.   The view of the city was remarkable and the pool was really nice. \nI like mentioning that the pool was really nice because I spent my time at this casino-free oasis whenever I could. \nThere is a bar in the dining area in the lobby and a bar in the awesome pool area.  \nIt is quite possible that the pool area was remarkable because of me.  I did not build or plan the pool area,  but I was there in swim trunks.  \nI might need to put this in perspective.   I am quite attractive, and when you put multiple attractive people in a pool and they are wearing swimsuits, good things are going to happen, and happen they did.   Everyone that was not gambling or searching for women was at the pool,  looking awesome.  I was their leader.   Smelling with the sweet scent of Trumpy soap (that is what I called it), we all enjoyed the pool in the Las Vegas heat, our perfect Greek-godlike bodies glowing like stars, then we all ate too much and got fat, so we hurried to the airport and went home. \nThen we all blamed Donald Trump for our weight gain. \nBut do not be like us.  Go stay at the Trump and enjoy the pool.  I think they may be building a wall between the hotel and the mall to keep the fast food vendors and Uber Eats at bay.\n\nThis is a great review.
