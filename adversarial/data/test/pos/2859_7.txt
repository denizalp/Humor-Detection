Great place for bar food staples!\n\nThis location was defiantly once a Pizza Hut. If you are a beer drinker , which I am not, you will be in Heaven as they offer over 1000 choices! D's offers a lot of great food to go with all of their beers. Everything from apps, calzones, salads, sandwiches, wings wraps, pizza, hot dogs & burgers. They even offer a kids menu. They have TVs all over the place to catch the Steelers, Bucs or Pens in action.  \n\nMy two favorite things on the menu are the wings and the burgers. THEY ARE OUTSTANDING! The wings are very tasty and the burgers are big and juicy. You can get the wings one of two ways, dry rub and wet sauces. I like em' with seasoned salt and BBQ sauce on the side.  I have tried the \"Blues Brother\" and the \"Bacon Cheese\" burgers. They are both very, very good, The fries that come with them are just as good also.\n\nMy wife and daughter are hot dog connoisseurs and they both approve.\n\nService is always good and the food is even better!
