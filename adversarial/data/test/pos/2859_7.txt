The pubby that I adopted was a patients at Val Verde Animal Hospital. not only that but it was within three miles on my home, however  I was not impressed. \nThey\ny failed to bring to my attention some papilloma grows. The waiting times \nwere excessive. their main area of concern what is the do a dental cleaning at a high price on I should add..This new puppy had its teeth brushed for 3 years, everyday.  In addition they did not have any health insurance plans.\nThe Dr. Needed dental care for more than my dog. Good luck
