I was a guest at Dino's on 8\/16\/08. I was directed by Dino's staff to park in a back lot as the primary parking was full. Following the reception, I obtained a hotel room and did not return to my car until morning. The lot I'd parked in is Lakeland Community College property. As a consequence, my car was ticketed and towed (173 dollars). I contacted Pat, the owner and manager of Dino's, who laughed into the phone and told me he and his staff are in no way responsible for my inability to read a poorly placed \"no overnight parking\" sign (Sign is to the right of entrance, I parked to the left). Had I not been directed to the lot, I never would have parked there. Pat was disrespectful and confrontational during our phone conference. He made no attempt at amending the situation. Based simply on his treatment of people in this unfortunate circumstance, I would never recommend this restaurant. Take your business to someone who cares about their clientele.
