Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 20\/100\n\nCoffee, books, and good times... I love the fact that books are still in demand. Even if there is the strong push for Nooks and Kindles abound, it's still so much fun to hang out here!  \n\nWhat I love most about B&N in particular, is that you can find a spot in one of their \"reading areas\" and kick up your legs, and read a book for \"FREE!\"  Yup, grab a bunch of books or a handful of fashion magazines and go to town. This place is perfect for a lazy morning or afternoon.  \n\nThis B&N happens to be in a great location. It's well organized and the staff is friendly and helpful. My only gripe is that the starbucks cafe gets crowded and it's always hard to find a seat.  So, if you want to kick up your legs and relax, get there before the crowd on the weekends. \n\nIf you're a bookworm, make sure you ask about their membership card ($25 for one year). Once you're enrolled (like me) you get some decent benefits like: 40% off the list price of the current hardcover B&N Store Bestsellers or 10% off the B&N already discounted items, Bargain books, music, movies, Caf√© and almost everything else. This discount also applies to Text Books for all you college students out there.
