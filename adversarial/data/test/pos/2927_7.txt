Typically, I'm not a fan of buffets, but I would have to say this is the best buffet I have ever been to. At first, I thought the name was rather contentious, but this is definitely \"The Buffet\" of all buffets. If I had to do just one buffet while in Vegas, this would be the one.\n\nThe first thing I noticed while stepping onto the line was the smell. The aroma of food was fantastic and awakening to my senses. I made sure I came here on an empty stomach with a mean appetite, and it was well worth it. \n\nThe Buffet has an extravagant selection of food to choose from, and everything is presented very well. The selections are quite creative as well in contrast to most standard run-of-the-mill buffets. \n\nThe decor is bright and colorful in a cute, very floral sort of way. The service is very good as well, from the empty plates being pre-bused and frequent drink refills. I came here for dinner on a weekday, and although the price may seem a little steep at first glance, it is quite competitively priced for all that you get as well as the dining experience.
