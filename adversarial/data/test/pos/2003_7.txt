Not a bad place to go and watch sports.  There are a lot of small TV in crappy spots.  If someone was intelligent when building the place, they would have put large TV's in higher locations on the wall.  Other than that, food is avg.  Only thing I would eat again is the chicken wings.  Get them plain and 4 flavor a on the side.  It's the way to go if you end up here.
