ok. this is going to be short and sweet.\n\ni was going from playboy club to ghost bar when i was accosted by a drunk female. she started yelling at me and saying that i stole her drink or something. i tried to explain that she had me mistaken for another dashing young gentleman. she started to yell for security. i was literally dumbfounded. security grabbed me, kgb style, and started interrogating me. well let me rephrase: they started talking questions at me. i could not get a word in edgewise. i am not going to get into what happened next because yelp is not the place for that sort of thing. but needless to say i will never be frequenting ghost bar again.
