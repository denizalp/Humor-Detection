This place has really gone down.  If you plan to go there and check it out for yourself, I highly recommend that you take your own plates, silverware and glasses. I searched for a very long time, for a clean plate and silverware.  It's like they must be using cheap dish washer detergent that doesn't quite rinse from items and leaves streaks, smears and dirt. \n\nI was also surprised to find that the food was cold, despite being under hot lights.  This almost killed my appetite and I found myself looking for a microwave, to no avail.  The macaroni and cheese was watery and reminded me of Kraft boxed macaroni, along with being possibly mixed with cheese soup.  The pizza was bland, and the fat hadn't been pulled from the fried chicken.  The cantaloupe tasted bland, although the nachos were crisp and you were offered a variety of fillings, i.e. refried beans, hamburger, cheese, etc. The chicken nuggets were ok, if that's your thing.  The short ribs, while seasoned nicely, had very little meat.  It was like eating neckbones.  The best thing that I ate were the beef stew and a side serving of strawberry covered bananas.  The meat was tender, not too stringy and tasted marvelous. I was disappointed with the cheese cake, as it reminded me of jello.  I would've tried something else, but was stuffed after sampling a little bit of everything.  Overall, I was surprised there weren't better and more plentiful choices. I expect a restaurant's food to taste better than what I make at home.  Sadly, this was not the case and I felt that the price paid $11.29@ was exorbitant. Thank God I didn't opt for the soda (an additional fee), as I've grown tired of sugary replicas. \n\nThe waitress was courteous and overwhelmingly helpful, although since I fixed my own plate, what else did she have to do other than clear empty plates? I didn't expect to have to tip for that.  The bathroom was clean and no lingering odors were prevalent. \n\nThe parking lot was clean and ample spaces were available.
