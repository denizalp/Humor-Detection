I would give it 4 stars for the food but due to the note below I had to take it down to 3.\n\n\nWent there for dinner tonight based on all the Yelp reviews.  we sat outside as it was another gorgeous night.  The decor is as everyone described it: TACKY and STRANGE.\nThe food was really good.  Here is what we had and what we thought of the meals:\n\nFrom the \"HEFTY RICE SIZZLERS\"  section:  Two Chicken Kebab\/Chicken Tikka Rice $12.50 - REALLY GOOD!!! Comes on a huge bed of rice with veggies and the meat.\n\nFrom the \"LAHORI KAHARI\" section:  Karahi Chicken:  REALLY REALLY Greasy!! in a small iron skillet, I would pass on this next time and just order another Rice Sizzler or something less oily.\n\nWe also has a Garlic and Plain Naan bread, which was of course really good.\n\nAll in all we found the service to be nice and helpful.\n\nAs an important aside:\n\n*****Here is what bothered us the MOST:  It is truly unbelievable that a dine-in restaurant would use STYROFOAM PLATES, CUPS and PLASTIC CUTLERY!!!!!!!!  People please......it is 2012, let's have some respect for the planet we all call home.  \n\nWe were appalled at the staff just literally filling garbage bags full of STYROFOAM!   This stuff is being banned in California.  Canada should wake up and ban it also!!!!!  \n\nHow about real dishes and cutlery?  What a concept!
