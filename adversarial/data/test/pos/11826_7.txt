I Remember when this Theater was Formerly Known as Rave Motion Picture Theater...\n\nAlthough the Name has Changed, Everything is the same! Not in a Bad Way...For Your Convenience, they do have the Box Office Window to Purchase your Tickets, but there are also 4 Kiosks for you (Credit Card or Debit Cards, Only) to use in case you don't want to stand in line. \n\nI Remember Posting a Tip that the Matinees are $5...well, it has gone up by 25 Cents! So it's Now 5.25 for a Matinee, and for the Weekends, 6.25! Still Not too bad for going to the Movies! \n\nHappy Yelping Y'all!
