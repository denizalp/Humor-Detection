The food was good, but I gave this place a poor rating because I went last night (on a thursday) for dinner with two friends. We started dinner at 7 pm. By 9 pm, they had turned off all of the lights but those on our table and were staring at us trying to get us to leave. I tried to use the restroom but the lights were off in the hall and restroom. I had to ask them to turn them back on. I proceeded to use the facilities only to find that they had also shut off the water (in their rapid close down routine) leaving me unable to flush and wash my hands (which I discovered only after I'd thoroughly coated my hands with soap). \n\nThey were unapologetic when I told them what happened and made no attempt to rush to help me clean my soap coated hands. Again, food would have gotten a 3.5 maybe 4 but this left a lasting impression with me and my friends who frequently dine in the area for our salsa classes. Never again.
