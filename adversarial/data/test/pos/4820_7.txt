I was craving for some late night eats, so it's a good thing that this place closes late, however the quality of the food isn't that great. I would say that this is more of a place for happy hour drinks and food, but even that - I felt that the taste and quality of the food is quite lacking.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Lobster & Shrimp Mac n Cheese: One would think that the dish is rich and creamy with delicious seafood. The Mac n cheese was decent and flavorful, but the lobster tasted very dry and overcooked along with the shrimp. I would skip this one (3\/5)\n\n2. NYNY Strip: The steak came out burnt and dry. The picture would say otherwise, but it didn't taste so great in the mouth. It came with sweet potato fries, which were decent, along with Moroccan ketchup. The ketchup was okay. For a pricey meal, it just wasn't worth it (3\/5)\n\nService was decent, but we could tell that they kind of wanted us out of the place - that sucks, one shouldn't feel rushed to finish eating; we are the customers! But anyways, for the price that you pay for the meal, it just doesn't match up to par with the quality you expect from the food.
