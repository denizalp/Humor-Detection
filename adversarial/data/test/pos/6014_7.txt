While his fellow degenerates were shoving their chips all-in on the Mirage's poker tables. our hero struck up a conversation with one of the players at his table.  She seemed a bit bored after playing for a \"short time\", which actually meant 6 hours at the table.  Turns out she was Randi from www.savelv.com, which is a really great online resource for finding free and discounted things to do and eat around Las Vegas.  Aside from being a good resource for food deals, she also knew some interesting Vegas factoids (like that the tallest Christmas tree on display in the US was this year was a 109 footer at M Resort, north of the Strip).  Taking her advice on steak deals around town, our hero made a mental note of the off-menu special at Mr. Lucky's in the Hard Rock casino for the next morning.\n\nThe $7.77 secret special for an 8-oz. steak, mashed potatoes, and 3 shrimp on a skewer is a steal of a deal that's available 24\/7.  It comes with a basic (but fresh and leafy) salad as well.  Our hero had his steak medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection with nice blackened criss-cross grill marks on it.  The cut of the steak was surprisingly good for the price and was very tender and moist.  Our hero's hungry and hungover cohorts ate it extra slow so that they could savor the juicy meat.  The mashed potatoes on the side were excellent and tasted very smooth and creamy.\n\nEven if you aren't lucky at the tables, you can still get a lucky deal on a meal at the Hard Rock!\n\nPROS:\n- Excellent off-menu $7.77 steak and shrimp special.\n- Friendly service that checked up on us frequently.  Even the manager walked around and personally checked on all the diners.\n\nCONS:\n- The regular menu items are somewhat limited and they have an odd combination of Western and Chinese food to choose from.
