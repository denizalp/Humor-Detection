Happy happy hour!!!! \n\nI pass by this place all the time and have always wanted to try it out. We came here for happy hour and got the works. Food, drinks, u name it. And everything was delicious!\n\nFor the food we ordered the verde chicken flatbread and the boneless buffalo wings. Half buffalo and bbq. The bbq ones were really good. \n\nNow onto the good stuff. $5 martinis, $4 wines! 1\/2 off appetizers! My first martini was the Tickled Pink. This comes with X-Rated Fusion Liqueur, DeKuyper Peachtree, cranberry and orange juices. Quite tasty I must say. My 2nd martini, and when I saw this on the menu I just had to try it. S'Mores!! This is as amazing as it sounds! & for $5 why not? lol.\n\nThe drinks aren't that strong but they are quite tasty. I will definitely be coming back for some more martinis. =)
