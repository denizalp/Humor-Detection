Well, I used to like this place aside from their crazy waits and clueless service, but now that I have a baby, I guess I'm no longer welcome there. \n\nTHEY HAVE NO HIGH CHAIRS OR BOOSTER SEATS?!?!?\n\nThat's just ridiculous. I went there with my husband and our 15-month-old daughter the other day and couldn't believe it when the hostess told us we were out-of-luck. \n\nPeople with small children like sushi too.
