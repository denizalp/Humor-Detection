I just love this place! I have been eating here since I was a wee little girl. I love taking people here who haven't been which is usually someone who has moved here from somewhere else because what true native hasn't eaten here?! When family comes to town this is my go-to place to go out for breakfast.\n\nI can't go and not get an order of \"Fried Zucchini Sticks\". They are the best I have ever had! They come in a half or full order and you can get cheese sauce or ranch or both for dipping. If you haven't tried them yet please do! I always get the \"Green Hornet\". It has avocado and cheese and tomatoes. I am notorious for it and just can't change it but do take a bite off my families plates hehe!\n\nJust so you know, the omelets are made with 6 eggs so if you don't think you can eat that much you can just ask for a \"baby\" and they will make it with 3 eggs. They also give you a little off the cost for using less eggs I think it is like 75 cents or something. The spuds are so good too. I usually ask for them with no salt and love to dip them in ranch dressing.\n\nThe lines can be long but you don't wait for long and the wait is more then worth it! This last visit we waited maybe 5 minutes. They are only open for breakfast & lunch. During the week it isn't as hectic as trying to eat at Omelet House on the weekends but still consistent.
