YASMG!!\n(Yet Another Strip Mall Gem)\n\n3.65 stars.  Not quite a solid 4 but pretty darn close.\n\nI like the deliberate decor.  Much more interesting than I expected in a strip mall.  Warm textures and soft lighting as well as exposed brick.\n\nThe service was predominantly very good.  There was a moment when one of my coworkers received his salad and was surprised that it had cheese.  He hadn't read the menu and it didn't occur to him that a house salad would come with blue cheese.  The waiter was a little put off that he didn't want the cheese on the salad but then returned it and brought out another salad minus cheese.\n\nI had the penne ala vodka which came with asparagus, asiago, basil, prosciutto and a nice vodka sauce, portion size was good.\n\nBased on my visit I would return to try other selections.
