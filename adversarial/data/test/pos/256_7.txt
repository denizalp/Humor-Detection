Second time dealing with Butler within the past year. I had Will Butler along with Tara as my team working on my mortgage. They were extremely helpful and patient. They even secured a loan with a major bank that my partner is a client of and could have never gotten the rate Butler did. \nWill provided very valuable advice on rates and the mortgage we went with. \n\nI would highly recommend anyone giving Butler Mortgage a call when looking at a Mortgage Broker.
