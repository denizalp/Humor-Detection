Willy wonka would stop by this donut shop. Maybe not the one played by Johnny Depp but the older one played by Gene Wilder. The only thing that could make this place a ten star place is if they had umpa lumpas work the donut shop.\nThe place has so many different glazes and a plethora of toppings, which makes the combinations of donuts endless. They have cherry, mint, chocolate, salted caramel, blueberry, chocolate chips, maple, even bacon!!!!! So once you figure out the type of donuts you want, you can watch the freshly made donuts make their way on the conveyor belt. The donuts are picked up and placed in the glazes of your choose and then the toppings are put on all right in front of your eyes. Yum yum!
