I've been a regular here for a while and I've stuck to the first massage therapist that I tried. He is good at getting the knots out and having me leave feeling relaxed! I tip him about 40% every visit. \n\nHowever, last night I called to book an appointment w\/ him but he was all booked so the person on the phone convinced me to try someone else who was \"just as good and has been w\/ the business for 2 years\". I regretfully agreed.\n\nAs I was getting my massage from her, she was just rubbing my skin around. She didn't work out any muscles or knots. The worst part was she used her elbows frequently and when she was working on my back she kept grinding her elbows into my spine! I was grunting in pain. I really should've walked out of there but I was hopeful that the massage would get better but it never did! I was glad it was over when it was over. I left there aching more than when I walked in. \n\nTo add insult to injury, as I was paying for the massage I gave her an undeserving $5 tip OUT OF PITTY. I (or anyone) should not even be paying to be tortured like that but I'm not a big complainer and I try to sympathize. So then the cashier guy says \"only a $5 tip? The massage was $45\". Are u fcking kidding me? Tacky! I was too exhausted for confrontation so I gave the beggars an extra $4. This whole ordeal turned me off to ever coming back here! The business sucks but my original massage therapist is great. Hmm \n\nIt is now a day later and my spine is still sore and in pain from her massage.
