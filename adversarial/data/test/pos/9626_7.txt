Amazing service! \nSuper friendly, experienced, effective and fairly priced.\nPaul answered my call immediately and showed up right away.  He was very knowledgeable and took his time as he explained what he would do and what my responsibilities were. I really appreciated his patience and understanding in such a stressful situation.\nHighly recommend Armour Pest Control and will continue to use their services in the future should I require these type of services again.
