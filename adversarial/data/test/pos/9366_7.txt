Fern: Flavors of the Garden was one of the most beautiful restaurants I have dined in since my move to the Charlotte area eighteen months ago. The new location has a wall of windows that let in an abundance of natural light, accenting the soft green and white decor. At times I felt transported to a patisserie in the Montmartre neighborhood in Paris, at others it was as if I was in Malibu. No detail was overlooked, from the water glasses to the silverware, and the decor was chic, understated, and cool.\n\nAs a vegan partnered with a meat-eater, dining out can be complicated and breakfast is the worst! After investigating several options, we agreed on Fern because its vegetarian and therefore has eggs. When we arrived we were presented with brunch and lunch menus. My partner ordered apple pancakes with a molasses glaze and I ordered tofu breakfast nachos, both from the brunch menu.\n\nUnfortunately for such a beautiful restaurant, we found the food to be rather disappointing. The apple pancakes had a strange texture and a bitter aftertaste, perhaps from improper use of molasses. i was particularly bummed about the tofu breakfast nachos (probably because they were mine!). The tortilla chips were nearly stale, and the tofu had clearly not been pressed. The liquid from the tofu and beans was poured over the tortilla chips, leaving a soggy mess at the bottom. Further, the tofu was bland and the whole dish lacked flavor.\n\nI have hemmed and hawed over whether to give Fern three or four stars. The decor was simply gorgeous, and the natural light would make it a perfect Saturday morning spot for coffee and a crossword. I ultimately decided three stars because the food was lacking in flavor and my Saturday morning fantasy would be disrupted by Fern's glaring lack of an espresso machine. Lattes are THIS girl's best friend.
