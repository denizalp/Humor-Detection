Star Nursery's truck dumping rock down S. Rainbow and on the 215 West. The dump truck has a huge sign on the. Ack that says,\"NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BROKEN WINDSHIELDS\"! Really Star Nursery, who is responsible for your carelessness. Damaging people's windows and chipping up people's paint jobs. Very unprofessional!!
