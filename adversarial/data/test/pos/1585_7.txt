After reading all these reviews for \"Cleveland's Best New Restaurant\", we had such high hopes for Butcher & The Brewer. Man, were we disappointed.\n\nLet me tell you, I was not expecting to have AMAZING service, especially in a restaurant as big and as packed as this place (and since I am a server myself, I feel for these people running around like crazy) and we did go on a night with two concerts and a home Indians game. My boyfriend and I met up with some family friends of his and right when we sat down our waitress showed up to take our drink orders. I love beer, but seeing \"Draft Wine\" on the menu made my heart pitter-patter. My boyfriend stuck with the Farmhouse Rouge, while our friend ordered the Le Boucher and four appetizers for us to share right off the bat. This is, sadly, where things began to go downhill. My boyfriend's beer came out in a regular 12 oz. glass and it was a bright orange-y yellow color. The menu said that the Farmhouse Rouge was an amber, and I even commented how brightly colored it was, but continued sipping my DRAFT WINE (still excited about this). It was also a little hoppy for his taste at first, but the more he drank the more he enjoyed it. Our friend's Le Boucher was a deep maroon color that came in a smaller snifter glass. One by one, our appetizers arrived. The sliders, while a tad overcooked, were delicious thanks to the brioche bun and the spicy mayo. The corndogs were also delicious, no carnival wieners here. The whole wings (which were just okay) were brought out to us by our actual waitress, not a food runner, so we asked about our fourth and final appetizer we were waiting on, the one we were all the most excited about: the bone marrow. She said she would gladly go and check on it for us and that it should be up any minute. Well, that any minute soon turned into 20 minutes. Then 25 minutes. Our waitress came back to see if we needed any drinks, with no last appetizer in her hands. Our friend asked about the bone marrow AGAIN, and changed his beer to a Farmhouse Rouge, which my boyfriend ordered again and I ordered another glass of wine. \n\nNow things just get a little strange. The waitress comes back and tells us that they are out of bone marrow and have been all night. Considering we ordered the appetizers almost an hour prior and we were just being told this right then after asking about it several times, we were a little iffy. But mistakes do happen, and she said she would buy us the round of drinks we were waiting on for the trouble. In comes my wine, and then in comes the two snifters of a marooney, dark Farmhouse Rouge. WAIT, WHAT?? Right as she puts his glass down, my boyfriend looks at her and says, \"Wait, we both ordered the Farmhouse Rouge?\" and, kind of in a snotty tone, she replies, \"Yeaaaah, that's what this is.\" Since he had ordered it before and this obviously was a completely different beer in color, taste, even glass it was served in, he asks what the first beer he was served actually was. She says she's not sure and walks away. Okay then? Today, we still have no idea what beer he drank when we arrived there. It will forever be a mystery. \n\nWe decided to order entrees as well, and all I can say is stay away from the shrimp and grits. The grits, the poached egg, and the large pieces of pork belly were delicious on their own, but they couldn't save the dish from the very fishy shrimp. Instead of being plump and sweet, they tasted almost like shrimp cocktail, the kind you can tell aren't fresh and were probably frozen a while ago. For a $16 price tag, it just wasn't worth it. Come to this establishment for the beer (if you are actually served the one you order), the draft wine (STILL YAY!), and an appetizer, but don't expect stellar service or seafood for the price. Probably won't be returning or recommending it any time soon, and that makes me sad.
