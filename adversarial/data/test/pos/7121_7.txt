I don't even know how they swiped the card so fast. \n\nWe hit the drive through at a busy but not packed time. As in, a line in the parking lot but not out in the street.  I ordered our two thingies and when we got to the window the clerk took the card and handed it back with the drinks in like .2 seconds. I was impressed. \n\nDuring peak hours this place does way more business than the space can handle and you get a line of cars blocking one of the lanes on University, the city should get more tax money for that. Or maybe Starbucks could adopt the street and get out there to fill some pot holes with used coffee grounds; which as far as I can tell would hold up about as long as a city patch.
