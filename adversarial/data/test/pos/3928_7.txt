There's a reason this is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip. It's a dump. It's almost always been a dump. It's a dump now. It's probably always going to be a dump. And it's run by people who know it's a dump and treat it that way. Try to valet a car. The valet screams at you to pull up because he doesn't want to have to walk the 10 feet to your car. Try to eat at a restaurant (if you dare.) The food is cheap because it's poor quality and cold. The place is worn out. The service staff is worn out and if you think this is a great place you probably don't get out of your trailer park very often. I'll never go back. I tried it to be fair to see if it was a bad as everyone says it is. And it is.
