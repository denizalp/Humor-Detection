Solid, perfectly executed, fresh ingredients in some very ecclectic flavor combinations.\nAnd the menu warns you about it before you order. And so does your server.\n\nBIG WINS:\n*** spaghetti with meat sauce. served piping hot fresh, fresh oregano, perfectly cooked pasta, delicious gravy.\nI'm serious about this one. cheesy goodness and just fresh. did I say fresh?\n*** chocolate cake dessert. so rich, i literally took one bite and i was on overload. boxed for to-go! nice!\n\nECCLECTIC\n* \"caesar\" salad. more of a cobb\/caesar hybrid with lots of cheese, hard-boiled egg, thiinly sliced italian ham and anchovy.  RICH and creamy, and CHEESY! but that's not a Caesar salad.\n* sweet and spicy sausage pasta. As in candy-sweet from reduced syrup. whoa! that's sweet.\n* caprese salad. mozzarella very stiff. spinach\/greens mix. pesto's vinegar bites like a beast. wow sour!\n* pizza was not undercooked. fresh ingredients, but not a memory maker.\n\nDecor is eccentric as the menu. Strong purposeful choices are part of the fantasy world which is Amy's BC. Electric-powered wall-mounted candelabras (who wants drippy candle wax all over you?!) and \"who's the fairest of them all\" gold-painted-relief mirrors in 2-food cadence on the walls. By the way, there is a drippy-candle-wax display at the end of the dining room. :) Don't miss the diamond-checkerboard parlor tile, a la Alice in Wonderland. Completing the faux fantasy is the music. I can't remember this 90's artist's name, but it's Enigma-like middle-eastern dungeon music. [Edit: *found it*!! The artist is 'Delerium' and I do highly recommend their albums, but it's just a bit heavy while I'm dining... that's just me.]\n\nTHE REST\nOwner\/waiter Sammy and his assistants were very friendly and attentive.\nThe other patrons are regulars and one is staring and peering at us to see if she can detect an ulterior motive. We have none.
