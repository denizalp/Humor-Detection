I didn't plan on going to Bosque, it was fate. Actually, I was lured over by the resident dog while visiting the adjacent coffee shop. I followed Bennie the Boxer in and found an urban garden of cacti, succulents, and plenty of things I can't pronounce and probably can't be entrusted with, given the epic Orchid Massacre of 2014. I just don't have a green thumb.\n\nThat said, while the Bosque was not made for me, it is a beautiful place to browse! The variety of plants packed into the tiny space is impressive, as is the knowledge of the staff. I overheard a few conversations about temperature, water frequency, and soil consistency that quickly reminded me that plant parenthood is not for me. For now, I'll have to settle for admiring the terrariums and decor from afar!
