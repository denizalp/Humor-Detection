Hands down the best Cirque show in Vegas! You definitely get what you pay for! We were able to snag 2nd row seats on the side and they were pretty good considering they were the lowest price range. There were obstructed views in the beginning during pre-show but during the show, we were so close that we felt like water could have gotten onto us! We were able to see the performers' faces and facial expressions and were so thrilled to be so close that we could really tell how high the divers really jumped! The theatrics were great (like every other Cirque show) and the performers were very good at what they did!\n\nI highly recommend this show! It is about an hour and a half and totally worth the extra money as compared to the other Cirque shows!
