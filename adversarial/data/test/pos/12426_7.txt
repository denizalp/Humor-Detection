Finally after many many years I got see a UFC here at the MGM grand arena. For an arena that fits 11-13k tops  there really isn't a bad seat in the building. The arena is in the back of the casino on that leads out to the MGM pool\/Wet Repubic.\n\nThe concession food totally sucks even for concession standards but all is forgiven for one simple thing. You're allowed to bring in outside drinks into the building as long as it's in a clear cup. They even provid you with clear cups to switch out your drink. I made sure to take advantage of that when I came back the next day for the 2nd UFC show of the week. I pre-partied my ass off so I wouldn't have to bother paying $15 for a cocktail at the stand in the arena.
