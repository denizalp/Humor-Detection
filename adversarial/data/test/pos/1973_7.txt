Now that I'm getting older, I notice my taste in clothing has changed. No longer am I shopping at Forever 21 for my work attire. Of course Banana Republic is pricier, but you get what you pay for. \n\nSince this is an outlet, they have bargains throughout the store. And if you shop during the holidays, there are additional discounts on top of the already marked down prices. They have a large variety of casual and business attire for men and women. They have bright colors for your fun days, and solids for your work wear. Their patterns add flare without being too young looking. Their clothing is better quality and will last much longer. And for the vertically challenged women out there like me, they have a pretty decent petite section. Super cute and not old lady looking at all. On my recent visit, I bought 2 pairs of black slacks for $120. A bit pricey for some people, but like I said, the quality is much better and I don't need to get them hemmed. Score!!! \n\nEmployees have been nice every time I've shopped. There is also a fitting room attendant, so you aren't just standing there waiting for a room. One star taken off because it can get a bit messy and harder to shop around. I suggest shopping earlier in the morning while the store is still clean.
