Yes, it resembles a Chipotle on the inside.  That's not what rubs me the wrong way about this place, it's the smell.  \n\nWhen we got home from our first trip there (we got our order to-go) we had this smell I couldn't quite place.  The food was decent, but I couldn't figure out what smell was hanging on our clothes.  \n\nOn our second trip, I saw the culprit as we pulled into the parking space - firewood.  I guess they cook over wood, which I guess is supposed to make things tasty, but man, you don't have to sit in there for that long to leave smelling like you've been camping.  Now, I'm not a happy camper, so maybe it's because of this that I have bad associations with that smell.  I just can't imagine why one would want to leave lunch\/dinner and smell like a fire.\n\nAgain, the food was pretty decent.  The burgers are large but thin and on visit #2 they forgot my fries (but charged us for them), but they're not bad.  The Rob got a carne asada burrito and was pretty happy with it both times.\n\nWe may go back because they've been sending coupons in the mail, but I'll be the fidgety person waiting to grab my food and run before I get too much Eau de Campfire.
