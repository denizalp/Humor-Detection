This is nothing against the guards themselves. Never mind that my friend, who lives in Anthem and shall remain unnamed, calls them toy cops. Actually, I think that's my term.\n\nAnyway, going through this guard gate is always a pain. I never want to live in a gated community, let alone a community with a staffed gate. Luckily, I showed up early on Superbowl Sunday and avoided the half hour plus waits the other guests endured.\n\nOn a positive note, it's nice that you can get alerts on your phone whenever your guests go through.
