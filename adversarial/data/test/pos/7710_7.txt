Four of us met here for a \"fast food\" kind of dinner as we all had a show to attend after dinner.  Sofrito is in what is called Campus Commons and it's the former waiting area for the car wash\/detailing business that was here and closed years ago.  The inside waiting room was converted into small food vendor areas with a common seating area running the length of the building.  Some of the businesses got their start here and moved on while some failed.\n\nOn this evening, we ordered:\n\nAlcapurrias - Fried Taro Root filled with Pork\nEmpanadas con Pollo - Chicken in Puff Pastry\nRellenos de Papa - Potato Balls filled with Ground Beef\nSurullitos - Fried Corn Sticks\nMaduros - Sweet Plantains\nCarne Frita con Tostones - Fried Pork Chunks with Fried Plantains\nTostones al Ajillo - Fried Plantains with Garlic Sauce\nBacalaitos - Fried Cod Fish Fritters\nChuletas Fritas with Arroz con Gandules - Crispy Pork Chop with Puerto Rican Fried Rice\nMofongo - Fried Mashed Plantains\nArroz con Dulce - Cinnamon Rice Pudding with Raisins\nTembleque - Coconut Custard\n\nStandouts for me were the rellenos de Papa, bacalaitos, empanadas, alcapurrias, and mofongo.  On the sweet side, both desserts were very good with the rice pudding being different from the creamy rice pudding you normally get and the coconut custard.  I wish they had some utensils other than plastic but given the type of place the food court is, that's got to be the way to go. \n\nThe owner of the business was a delight.  After placing the order, wed had a seat at the less than comfortable, built-in seats of the food court, and she brought our dishes to us with a pleasant smile.\n\nThere was a lot of food ordered--a bill coming to $80, but for that amount, we had more than enough for four people.  I'm sure I'll be back to get some Rellenos de Papa and mofongo.  Oh, and I can't forget the rice pudding.
