Cornish makes my tummy and heart happy!\n\nI stopped in after looking at wedding dresses for a close friend of mine (always a bridesmaid..never a bride. . . ) and this place made me feel less depressed and likely to spend my life alone... because...\n\nThe food will make you forget it all! Feed your face and feed your feelings! I had never heard of a pasty before coming here and this is what has been missing from my life.\n\nI don't need a boyfriend any longer . . . I can get a Shepherds pie to keep me safe and warm. Need someone to make you feel loved and wanted? Pssh..forget that...shove your pie hole with a pasty--and then make it a pasty hole! Try the Tikka Masala and then change your last name to Cornish Pasty-Tikka Masala.. no one will question you ...because they know you found what is right in the world.\n\nFeeling a little tied down? Try Reuben.. he's so good and filled with pastrami and can take you to the 1000 Islands. . . he's like an ugly fat man but rich so he's a bit more attractive. But, certainly delicious.\n\nWant to get a little freaky? BANGERS and MASH! It's like a threesome in you mouffff! Do it!!\n\nGo to Cornish Pasty! Seriously!!! Go and find that special pasty..that special something to make your soul feel good again.
