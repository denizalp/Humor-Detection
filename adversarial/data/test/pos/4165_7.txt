**Disclaimer: Haven't been in this store, just had a cupcake.**\n\nLast summer when Missy F. was staying with my Dude and I for a while, she popped into Mind Over Batter and brought us both a cupcake as her way of saying, \"THANKS, Y'ALL!\"\n\nWhat a delicious cupcake! Extra moist (lawl, moist) cake and just the right amount of coconut.\n\nI would totally stop in and pay $3 to have one of these babies again!
