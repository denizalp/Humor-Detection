Been going here since 2004.  The staff along with Dr. Pennel and Dr. Hicks are very helpful and friendly.  We have tried taking our doxie to other animal hospitals and it just wasn't the same.  When we first brought Honey here she was given a shot and later at home she had an allergic reaction.  We called Spencer Springs and it was after hours, so it was routed at that time to Dr. Hicks's phone.  He told us to meet him at Spencer Springs to take a look at Honey.  Dr. Hicks arrived in casual attire on his own time to help Honey out.  Thats what I call great customer service and dedication.  Dr. Pennel who basically is Honey's primary Dr.  has taken care of Honey is so many ways.\n\nI highly recommend this place.
