Found blood stains on the bedsheets from previous guest. My worst nightmare - housekeeping did not switch bedsheets. \n\nDear housekeeping - I did not find my room \"comfortable and well prepared\" because you did not change the bedsheets from the previous guest who slept on this bed. He\/she was bleeding in bed. And you didn't notice. So you don't change the bedsheets after guests check out? I hope he\/she isn't sick with a disease that can be transmitted through blood. I spoke with manager, Kendall Wallace, and he was just as unprofessional as you. Taking my lifetime gold status to other Starwood properties that don't have health hazards.
