Despite low expectations, this place was a Wonderland of gluttonous pleasure. The spinach is fresh, coffee free, desserts elaborate. \n\nThe only downsides: waiter kept staring at my crotch, 12 bucks is a bit much, and my blood sugar got waaaay too high.  (easily avoided with the average amount of impulse control)\n\nBest of: banana pudding, spinach, imitation crab, sweet potato casserole, green beans, ice cream, all things chocolate \n\nWorst: Chocolate chess pie
