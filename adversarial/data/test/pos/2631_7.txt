This place is a hoot and a half! I give it 5 stars for entertainment value!!!\n\nI am convinced that this casino is actually a triple wide trailer connected by a couple of doorways. They have lots of mirrors on the walls to make it seem bigger. This is a place for locals...and by locals I mean people from the trailer park behind the casino and patients from the convalescent hospital\/senior center nearby. Seriously a place for and by the \"tattooed and toothless.\" Go on Sunday and watch the Dummkopf's, a band that defies explanation. You can read about them at http:\/\/www.vegaslistings.com\/homepages\/dummkopf\/. If you have some spare time in Vegas check out Skyline for a unique experience.
