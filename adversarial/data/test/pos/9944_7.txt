I walked into this place and I was in heaven. I'm such a makeup junkie and this was the first Ulta store that I'd been to. I just usually order online from them since they don't have one in Hawaii.\n\nI wanted to buy everything in the store, but my hubby said that I was limited to one item. The three brands that caught my eye were Lorac, It Cosmetics, and Lipstick Queen. Those were the three lines that no one in Hawaii carries. Everything else I could find at home. \n\nI was so happy to get my hands on the Lorac Mega Pro 2. The Pro 1 sold out within minutes last year. I grabbed that and an It Cosmetics heart shaped brush. It was a limited edition brush for cancer awareness month. On the way to the checkout, I passed by Lipstick Queen. I couldn't help myself and picked up the Goodbye lipstick. It's really cool because it's this deep berry shade with blue shimmer specks in it. Yup, I went over my one item limit.\n\nThe workers were super helpful. They came around and asked me if I had any questions. They also helped me with my membership points. The salesgirl looked up my name on her computer system and told me that I could get $11 off with my points. Yippee! I love their rewards system.
