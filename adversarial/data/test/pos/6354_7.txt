Wow. Just wow, in the worst way possible. Was it an OFF night or something for them the night that I decided to enjoy my first meal in Vegas when I landed?\n\nI've heard only amazing things about Monta Ramen from fellow online Yelpers. But lemme tell ya, I should have listened to my actual Yelp foodie friends from the Bay Area. They told me, \"Monta ain't all that.\" \n\nDon't get me wrong, service was pretty good actually. Maybe too good...cuz my ramen came out within minutes of ordering. How is that even possible? Do they have it pre-made in the back and it's just microwaved or something?\n\nI had very high hopes for Monta, sadly...I will never return. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. TOO SALTY. And even if you ask for less salty...you're still gonna feel bloated as shizz from the sodium.\n\n2. Noodles are NO BUENO. They're like thin vermicelli noodles. I like my ramen noodles thick and with the right kinda chew!\n\n3. My soft boiled egg got cold within minutes. Hmmmm :-|\n\n4. Spicy means weaksauce-American-spicy to them.\n\n5. Oh yes, and there's always a wait here too. Why, I have no clue...\n\nDo yourself a favor. Go across the street to Ramen Sora and have a real bowl of delicious ramen. \n\nYou can tell I was quite excited to sit down and enjoy my meal when I first got to Monta...check out my YouTube vlog for that weekend: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DhN4ggfu52w&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA
