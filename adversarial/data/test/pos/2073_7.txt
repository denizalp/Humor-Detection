This place is still five solid stars, but I thought I'd update my review. \n\nThey raised their lunch special prices to $6.99, all substitutions are now one dollar and they no longer take 15% off for take-out orders. Do these things annoy me? Yes. Is it still the freshest sushi in the annex at the cheapest prices? Yep!\n\nA summer favourite of mine is getting S1 and S3 (detailed in my older review) to go and hanging out in Christie Pits. You should try it. \n\nHappy summer sushi-ing!\n\nPEPPER POINTS for their green salad dressing. Fresh ginger, not ginger mayo. Refreshing.
