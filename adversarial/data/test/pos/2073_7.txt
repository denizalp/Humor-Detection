A Delivery is a JOKE!!\n\nWe purchased a TV stand and during the delivery, they damaged our wall and the furniture itself.\n\nThe guy named Arturo had unprofessional appearance, REAKED of body odor and smoke. He doesn't even CARRY it, hitting and damaging the walls of my house. I asked him twice to please stop. I said you damaged the wall and Arturo sarcastically said \"It is just s wall\" and was laughing the whole time.\n\nBy the time he gets upstairs, I was screaming at him. He NEVER stops, apologizes or says a word. \n\nI returned the item back to store and called the manager. He said they will fix my wall and replace the unit with the new one. I will update this review after they redeliver the unit.
