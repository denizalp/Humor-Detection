Fresh, fast and authentic Greek cuisine! I highly recommend the greek salad and add gyro meat ($10). Their meat is slow cooked all day and freshly shaved upon ordering. It comes with two dipping sauces for a nice variety! The service is wonderful and staff is extremely friendly. The parking can be annoying around lunch time with such a tight area- try pakring by the Walmart and walking over.
