Hell yeah! Gordon is my favorite chef and this is another one of his masterpieces! Well thought and put together, great amount work went into  every detail. Take a selfie with his picture and a video with his presentation near the entrance. Then buy one of the t-shirts from the gift shop, because you'll remember this experience for a while! The food is some of the best you can get, we tried the short ribs, the Purgatory Eggs, the avocado toasts and loved everything about them! I've heard the burger is delicious but I didn't have any room left, so I'll get it next time. Make sure you get the Pineapple sorbet dessert with dry ice \"smoke\" inside, it'll make for a great Instagram post!
