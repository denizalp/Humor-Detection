I'm giving this place ONE STAR...\nMe and my boyfriend of Seven years went there for his 35th birthday  with his grandparents....\nHad 2 beers at the bar and ordered another beer at the table for food... AMY, the manager told my 35 yr old boyfriend he had enough to drink (3beers) ... And she wouldn't give him any more... How insaluting!\nWe will NEVER be back.and its our first time. Whos right is it to say that? Three beers is the limit at outback? Funny how we spent over $100 on 4 meals but can't have more than three beers... \nNever again! How Fucken Rude! Thanks AMY\nUPDATE:\nI Called to complain about it and they didn't care how I felt about the situation... Never again will we EVER GO.. UNLESS you plan on having 1 beer or less . .
