Hello! \nMy husband and I have been living in Crosswinds apartments in Chandler AZ. We are not very happy with the extermination that has been going on for roaches. The company used peanut butter in the cabinets which just attracted the roaches even more and now there is a colony of roaches living in our convection oven (which is a $300 wedding gift!)There were holes behind our stove in the wall where they were coming from! We will not bomb this place because of our two pets and the fact that we do NOT want chemicals all over our belongings, and if anything all of the buildings needs to be bombed because of horrible roach and bed bug problems! We are frankly getting tired of dealing with this issue and it should not be our problem! If our belongings get even more ruined we will have to send you guys the bill of everything we had to do in order to defend our apartment against the roaches.
