For whatever reason, most of the Indian restaurants are grouped together near the Hard Rock so the addition of Urban Turban to the area comes as no surprise. However, unlike the other spots, UT offers a totally different experience than what I have come to expect.\n\nEven as the name suggests, Urban Turban is not your typical Indian eatery. The interior is modern, no Bollywood music and the menu is totally different. First off, the curries are bottomless. I had the butter chicken (which was delicious) and you can order as much of it as you want. If you get enough people ordering different curries, you can essentially have your own AYCE Indian buffet right on your table. With that being said, the plates are not family style but individual portions. The mango lassi and samosas were on point. As with most Indian restaurants, UT features a pretty sizable selection of vegetarian entrees. The staff and service was great, and there is a pretty good drink menu as well. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the mood for Indian food.
