Heard about this place and was told it was good, so after reading reviews on Yelp, I decided to stop in and get some lunch. This spot is located at the corner of 19th and Northern. From the outside of the restaurant, it isn't all that inviting. The building is old and doesn't look like it's had a makeover since it was built. The inside also looks old, but it has that mom and pop joint feeling to it. Even though it was older looking, it was clean from what I could see. \n\nI and my guest ordered the Medium pizza with 10 wings for $18.99. Their medium pizza is 14\"!! Huge for just the two of us. Was not disappointed at all with the pizza and I'm not a big pizza lover. The crust was just the perfect thickness, just the right amount of sauce and lots and lots of cheese. Yum! I would definitely come back for more pizza here. Wings were so-so. The taste was good, crispy on the outside, but half of the wings were dry and the other half was perfect. I was disappointed since my guest had been here before and said theirs was so good! Will give them another try on their wings as I love wings!\n\nThere was a young man that took people's orders and a young lady that brought out the orders. Both were very courteous. The young man answered questions about the menu and items they had with knowledge to the customers who came in. Took orders professionally and asked each customer who paid with a card if they wanted\/needed a receipt. The young lady smiled when brought out food, but other than that, I didn't see much of her. Both of them did eat their meal out at the tables while customers were there, but got up and took orders when people came in. Seemed kinda unprofessional to have the workers eating and getting up and down every few minutes to take orders. \n\nWill come back again soon as they have so many good looking items on their menu. \n\n5 stars for the customer service\n5 stars for the delicious pizza\n3 stars for the wings\n5 stars for how clean and organized the location was
