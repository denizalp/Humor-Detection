Loved this place! The ladies were awesome! Not too uptight and weren't afraid to include you in their conversations. At one point, we all went around and got to choose the next song to play. They really did go above and beyond to make sure we were happy...trust me, I was there for SIX hours getting my hair done, so I appreciate the entertainment. This was my first time ever getting box braids, and I LOVED them. The ladies were always making sure I was comfy and that the braids weren't hurting me. I was constantly getting compliments about how great my hair looked! Even my husband, who didn't really understood where \"all that hair\" came from said I looked great. I kept the braids in for about a month, wish I would've kept them in a little longer, but I'll definitely be returning there! The prices were not bad at all, considering the time and effort that went into the braids.  I had two different ladies working on my hair at once, so I can only imagine how long it would have taken if it was just one lady!
