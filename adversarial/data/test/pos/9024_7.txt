This is a decent place for coffee if you want a break and a change of pace from Starbucks. \n\nThe inside has a cool decor with lots of coffee-themed decor and a decent amount of seating if you want to sit and enjoy. \n\nStaff were funky and friendly, and overall the place has the feel of a local neighborhood coffee shop rather than a chain. \n\nThey have a large selection of hot and cold drinks including all your favorite lattes, americanos, and macchiatos. A nice perk - they have a large selection of sugar-free syrup flavors. Way more than Starbucks. That's a nice touch if you want to add some flavor and no calories. \n\nI tried an iced latte with sugar-free white chocolate. This was a very good beverage with a creamy texture, and the sugar-free syrup added nice flavor while saving on calories. \n\nThey don't have some of the bonuses of Starbucks like mobile ordering, and they are kind of tucked away in the back of a plaza making it a bit inconvenient. Prices actually seemed the same or higher than Starbucks for the same beverages. If you want a change and are not in a super hurry this is a decent choice.
