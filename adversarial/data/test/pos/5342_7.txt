True to a 3-star review, I am a-ok by this place. We had wandered by this place late in the day last trip out and there was just nothing we wanted to see. Since our hotel was so close to the place this time around, we thought it was genius to just wake up, go here, and hope to see a cirque show.\n\nWe slowly woke up and meandered out to the coke bottle location around the time they had opened. This saved us some face as the line only ended up being about 45ish minutes long. I didn't mind the wait because 10 minutes after I had been waiting in line the line continued like 45 people deep, and there were maybe 30 people in front of me. \n\nNow, you may wonder, why does this line move so slow? I do believe I can answer this for you. You only get to see the screens with the shows and prices on it once you're inside and that's when you're about 10 minutes away from buying. The screens are constantly shifting through the list of shows, so if you look too late and you only catch a glance at what you were looking for, you have to wait for it to pop back up. Then, if you are like our group, you only see the ranges of prices ($70-$110), so you think, well what does that mean? I cannot decide which show I want to pick from if I don't know where that price puts me. So then you wait to decide for sure until you are at the cashier. Then the cashier only adds a little extra info anyway, because you actually exchange your vouchers at the box office, so they can only give very general information about the categorey and location of the seats. We had been going back and forth between Mystere and Ka. Ka was more expensive, but we really wanted to see it, but we thought we'd be frugal and shoot for Mystere. What they also don't mention on the screens is that the prices don't apply to every show. We wanted to see an early 7PM show, but the cheaper Mystere prices only applied to the late show. \n\nI digress. So, without all the information before you get to the cashier, you're going to spend anywhere from 5-10 minutes taking up one of the two or three cashiers' time. This means a slow moving line. As other people have mentioned, they also like to throw in dinner deals, so that is probably part of it. If you already made up your mind, it may be harder to convince you to spend more money.\n\nAnyhoo, we opted for the early Ka show since the prices were not significantly cheaper for the earlier Mystere show. Now, an important piece of information. If, like us, you were waiting in line for Ka, and if, like us, you were at the coke bottle place, have one person in your group go wait in the box office line in the MGM. We did not. After we had our vouchers we walked over to exchange them for our tickets. There was already a long line. By the time the box office opened the line was huge, so I was thankful for where we were, until this happened. The group in front of us, four kids, were exchanging their vouchers for Ka. Categorey 3, I overheard (oh that's us!). I see the box office guy point to the center of the back section. Not too shabby I think! There was also a Cat 4 & 5, but the ticket place did not sell those. It's finally our turn to get our tickets and the same box office guy says \"this is all we have left for Categorey 3\" and points to the second to last row on the left. Oh. Our group of four got significantly downgraded from the other group of four. So as you can see, being further up in the box office line will make you a happy camper. Although after seeing Ka, I believe there probably isn't a bad seat in the house!\n\nIn conclusion, if you have a motivated group that doesn't mind waiting in line, I think it is worth it, but if you have someone who can't deal with the wait or an avid planner who has to know what they are doing before you step foot in Nevada, probably not worth it.
