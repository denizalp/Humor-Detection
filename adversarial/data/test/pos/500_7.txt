How quickly things change! Very, very disappointed to hear that Chef Troy left the restaurant because he discovered non-vegan ingredients were being served to guests as if they were vegan. Sounds like someone was taking shortcuts; however, for vegans, it is vitally important that we are able to \"trust\" the menu. My husband and I will not be back to this restaurant.
