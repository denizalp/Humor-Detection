NICEST STAFF EVER!!\n\nI have yet to come in and not get a warm, genuine greeting! I have always been happy with the recommendations and service. They get VERY busy at lunch and still, the wait is minimal at best and they are very good about letting me know when I could save money by doing X or get something for very little extra by doing X. \n\nThis is a SUPER addition to lunchtime choices in Uptown! They are also super for a quick breakfast as well!  \n\nOne thing I love, love, love is that there are NO CHILDREN. Normally when I eat at Panera by my house I feel like a day care let loose their demon children and allowed them to run amuck. I enjoy being able to sit quietly and eat my tomato bisque (OH MAN IT IS GOOD!) and not have some shrieking howler monkey nearby while their oblivious mom just keeps on chatting away on her iPhone.  Absence of children makes this the best Panera EVAH!\n\nThe free wi-fi is a super plus, too!!\n\nWELCOME TO UPTOWN PANERA...WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU!
