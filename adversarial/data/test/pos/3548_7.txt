Returned here for diner & yet again they did not disappoint, we're completely in love with this restaurant, their food & the service!! Richard was our server & for being a new addition to this restaurant he did a wonderful job & he didn't miss a beat. Jon was also gracious enough to stop by our table to welcome us which was very nice. Now let's talk about food, oh where to begin!! The meat & cheese board can never fail, very fresh & delish, nice variety!! We also tried a sample of the meatballs & all I can say is OMG I know what my next entree will be their!! The meatballs were beyond moist, you could taste the blends of meat & all the way down to the breadcrumbs that they used. The fresh marinara was delish & it also had the perfect amount of seasoning!! Now for the entrees my hubby couldn't resist & had to get the ribeye again with the beans, completely cooked perfectly & yes he was on cloud nine!! I decided to try the shrimp scampi with linguini being that they make their pasta in house, they were also gracious enough to add some fresh mushrooms for me!! All I can say is I wish I could cook like them because their food is beyond outstanding!! The shrimp were large & perfectly cooked, nice & tender, now the seasoning had a touch of spice which went perfectly with the dish!! We finished our meal with the in house made tiramisu courtesy of Jackie, yes you guessed it just as delish as our entrees, super moist with zero complaints!! This restaurant offers everything, great service, awesome food & a wonderful ambiance, what more could you ask for!!
