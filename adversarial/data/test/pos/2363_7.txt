Oh gawd I love chipotle! Fml I am obsessed. Burrito bowl with sofritas everything on it, I'm in heaven. I also do their kids meals, plenty of food to get me full for lunch. They have veggies, you get to pick between brown and white rice (they have some in the back without cilantro if you don't like cilantro). There are also pinto or black bens to choose from. They have garnishes: corn, sour cream, cheese, salsa (green and red), pico de gallo, and lettuce. Their chips are the best, they do a hint of lemon. For the kids meal you get two sides, a tiny thing or chips and a drink (chocolate milk please lol) \nOverall I LOVE chipotle! The food is delicious! I rarely eat there usually take it to go by the restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly.
