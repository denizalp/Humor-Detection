Just bought the Oreck orbiter(all purpose floor machine),it works great !!!!My tile and grout like amazing,also cleaned stains off my carpet and that was great as well.The costumer service at both locations was outstanding(i had a million questions). I love that i have a 5 year warranty and in case i have a problem,i can take it there.They also price match.\nThanks to both guys from both location,i'll be back
