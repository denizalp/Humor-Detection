I really hate this place. It reminds me of a costco or a shitter version of walmart. Its really industrial and sterile and the food quality isn't the best. The produce isn't bad  if you know what your doing . The meat is another story . Its real low quality stuff . And the seafood is inedible. ITs old and smelly half the time. \n\nThe redeeming feature of this big box of horrors is the bulk bins. Think of a dry good and you'll find it here. Beans , different kids of sugars , and flours , snack food seeds.Literally any dry good you could want is here.  \ni hate tihs place but the bulk bins ... they save it and keep me coming ... god damn my love of baking
