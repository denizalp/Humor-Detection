My friend recently moved to my side of town and we have been hanging out again, just like old times. When we were 16 we used to cruise around my wood panel '84 Buick Estate Station Wagon and discuss our lives. Now we are 30. Gas is no longer $1 per gallon and we are trying to be healthy so we go on walks. On a walk the other day he asked if I had to do laundry. I said, \"I don't know. I don't really think I need to. I guess I could do my comforter and stuff\". He replied \"You really gotta try out this place. I went there Saturday. It changed the game of laundry\". He was also bragging about a machine that text messages you when your load is done. I am the type of person that I have to see it to believe it. I actually think I will like doing laundry now! In an area with such high population density and apartment\/condo dwelling people (Lakewood, Edgewater neighborhood), I can imagine that a lot of people are in need of a nice place to wash clothes. The washing machines in apartments are usually run down and old. This Katie's Green and Clean laundromat has credit card operated machines! No more digging around or saving up quarters! Now, I can use my quarters for their intended purpose: my coin operated, motel-style vibrating bed (Magic Fingers-For sale on Ebay from seller MFingers). Or I can use those quarters for parking in Cleveland Heights! I urge anybody who lives anywhere from Tremont to West Lakewood to come here and wash their clothes! They even have a folding service. Expensive though. The gentleman running the shop was a real class act and was extremely helpful. My friend was right. They changed the game!
