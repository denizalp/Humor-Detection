If you're looking to grow you eyebrows out, get a nice shape and you're weary of trying a new spot -- this place is safe! \n\nI had a HORRIBLE experience with threading a few years ago and I'm still growing the middle part of one of my brows back. As a result, I had sworn off threading. I've been to a few other wax brow bars that were ok but mostly maintained my own brows for the past few years -- which usually resulted with me plucking way too much late at night in a bathroom mirror and waking up with regrets. Until I found this place! \n\nRecently, the new shop showed up in my yelp eyebrow search and I couldn't believe all the positive reviews and before\/after pics. I decided to give it a shot and now I'm hooked!\n\nFirst, who can beat $8 for brows?! And Farida, the owner is so sweet, patient and very gentle with threading. I remembered the process being a lot more painful but she does such a great job. She's also great about helping you map out your brows if you're trying to grow them out in certain areas (like me). \n\nI've gone twice now and I'll be coming back as a regular. Her service is great. The shop is clean and conveniently located with lots of parking in a plaza.  \n\nGone are the days of me plucking away my brows or praying that the brow bar girl doesn't get too rambunctious. Soooo happy I found this place!
