Let me start off by saying how unique this place is because if the decor inside. It feels like you're walking into an art museum that allows you to drink and party inside.  Free parking and no coverage and drinks are pretty affordable.  This was my escape away from the crowded strip and high class crowd.  I would have given this place a 5 star before because of the trendy social crown and the atmosphere that it brings.\n\nWTF happened to this place?  Every time I come here now, there are a bunch of ghetto ass people with even some sagging their pants down to the knees.  A bunch of annoying punks as well in the parking lot, drunk as hell talking sh*t.  Did someone pass out a flyer of this place in the ghetto and skanky side of vegas?  If i wanted drunk girls that all dressed in tight short, easy access dresses, I would have gone to Tao, XS and all these other nightclubs in the strip, but apparently they come here in the high numbers now also.  I am not feeling the type of people it attracts at all and I'm sure they would feel the same about the trendy and hippy crowd in downtown vegas.  This was my Friday night escape but now I guess i'll replace it with another place.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews about how bad these bartenders are. Real bad service and no system set in place.
