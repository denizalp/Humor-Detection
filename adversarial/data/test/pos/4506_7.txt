In most AYCE sushi restaurants, the quality of the fish can be sub-par. I admit I was skeptical at first but Umiya came highly recommended from a foodie and it blew my mind!\n\nI don't know if I have any favorite dishes since everything was so good! The albacore melts in my mouth, the oysters were refreshing, the unagi was decadent. \n\nThe yuzu drink was wonderful too!\n\nLunch was $21 and dinner is $26. SUCH A STEAL! Will definitely be returning on an empty stomach.
