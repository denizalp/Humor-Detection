I wasn't impressed. We went as a group of 10. Service was a bit lacking and our orders\ncame out so slow. Half of the items that we ordered never came out and after about 1.5 hours I called it quits. I never got my udon, various nigri, etc. Maybe because it is fairly new that they have to work out the system, but for now I will remain loyal to the places that I know will give me what I ordered. \n\nFish quality was ok. I did try an oyster even though it is not oyster season but it was definitely not a good oyster! I can't exactly remember anything that stood out to me that said this place is UH-MAZING. It was nice that there was a bunch of variety. \n\nOverall, service was lacking. We couldn't find our server for a good 20 minutes and food was ok. I wouldn't be back anytime soon.
