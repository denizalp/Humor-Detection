CJ is within walking distance from my office. I'm sure as hell not going there for the ambiance or friendly service. It's good Chinese food. Would I travel from Tempe to eat here? No. It's like every family owned, neighborhood Chinese place---you eat, pay and get out. And enjoy your Chinese fix\n\nI personally enjoy that the owner is also the hostess, the server, the chef, the cashier. There's something comic about it or maybe it's just that she's a bit of a character. Whatever it is, she's a \"Joy.\" China \"Joy?\"
