Considering that buffets aren't usually the highest quality of food, I was actually pleasantly surprised at the amount of, well, flavor at Flavors. I didn't taste a single thing that was bland and some of it was even actually quite good. Plus, there's something for everyone with stations ranging from seafood to meat carving and Italian, Mexican, Asian and more. It was a bit overwhelming at first trying to decide what to eat because there's so many choices. \n\nI started with a bowl of clam chowder that was very thick and creamy and a plate full of pasta, fried chicken and potatoes. I don't usually care for pastas at buffets but these pastas tasted great. They even put a fresh serving of chicken alfredo pasta out while I was browsing and the chef recommended that I give it a try. He did not steer me wrong. It may have been my favorite overall. Plate two included a small salad from the \"hidden\" salad bar, which is past the desserts on the left side. There's not a ton of toppings and I noted that there were no hard boiled eggs, which are my favorite, but everything was fresh. \n\nThen I moved over to the carving station, which was the biggest disappointment for me. At Friday lunch, there were three pork options and one turkey. Seeing as I don't eat pork, I was a bit bummed that there wasn't more variety. I tried a slice of turkey but it was a bit dried out. Adding some mashed potatoes and gravy did help some though. It would have been nice to see at least a beef option too. \n\nBut my disappointment quickly subsided when I saw the expansive dessert section. The gelato was a welcomed treat and the fruit tart was delicious! \n\nThe biggest draw for the buffet was the added all-you-can-drink special. After all, it is Vegas! Our waitress did a wonderful job of keeping our mimosa glasses full. I must have had four glasses over the course of the nearly three hours that we gorged ourselves at the buffet. \n\nCheck out Groupon to save some money. We got the lunch buffet option for about $23.50 per person, which is a good deal when you consider it includes alcohol. Honestly, the fact that it included alcohol was the biggest selling point for us. The fact that the food was better than decent was just an added bonus.
