This club likes to scam people into luring them in with the idea of free admission and bottle service. Free bottle service is only from a certain time period, despite the fact that they advertise it long after those hours have finished. Even though ladies did get in for free, all men even if they bring 10 ladies will have to pay the cover charge of 30$. Once inside, the \"ladies night\" special they advertise of free vodka drinks also lures women inside until they get to the bar and realize that there aren't free drinks and a cocktail is like 15$. The intoxicated male species partake in their mating calls and dances in hopes of preying on young naive ladies. To sum it up, not the best club to go to in Vegas.
