The Mirage that appeared in the desert nearly 30 years ago (November 1989) remains a viable Las Vegas destination. It isn't an elite hotel, but it is centrally located on the strip and in the rankings of MGM Resorts Vegas hotels including the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Vdara, MGM, NYNY, Luxor, Excalibur, and Circus Circus. \n\nWith over 3,000 guest rooms (including 280 suites), the Mirage survives as a hotel and casino first and foremost. If you are a regular gambler consider the Mirage for its bevy of perks for baccarat, sports book, and blackjack players.\n\nThe Beatles Love show by Cirque du Soleil is pure fun for any Beatles fan plus there are no bad seats in the house. The Mirage also attracts a rotation of well-known performers like ventriloquist Terry Fator. Staying at this hotel makes sense if you are going to see one of the shows.\n\nAs you would expect, the dining options at the Mirage offer something for everyone from Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak restaurant to a Carnegie Deli transplant. I used to love the Cravings Buffet, but there are better AYCE options in town if you're wanting higher-quality food. Other good dinner choices at the Mirage include Otoro (Japanese-inspired) or Stack (American classics).\n\nI've stayed at the Mirage a handful of times and lost money, seen shows, or had dinner three times as often. It turns out that this isn't a Mirage in the desert that disappears, but it is THE Mirage and a real a-ok choice for gambling or staying in Las Vegas.
