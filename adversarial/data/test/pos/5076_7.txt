Tried Bravo for the first time over the weekend. Met some friends for a nice lunch. The outside looks amazing, a nice upgrade to the galleria mall. \n\nWe had a reservation, but it didn't seem that busy for 1pm on a Sunday. The waitress, Daniela was very attentive. My group hadn't seen each other in a while so it took us a while to look through the menu. She was very helpful at recommending and making substitutions for our table. I ended up ordering the 5oz filet and I was pleasantly surprised by how tender it tasted. Very melt in my mouth.. Yum! I would definitely order it again. Daniela made sure we had everything we needed and we never had to worry about refills. Excellent service! \n\nHopefully, this place will pick up because it is a great addition to the restaurants in the area.
