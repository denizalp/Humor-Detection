Honestly, if I have never been to the Boiling Crab in San Jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  I just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  Some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  Seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  He explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a Cajun restaurant.  My lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!\n\nWe ordered snow crab legs since the blue crab and the dungeness crab were out (that was upsetting).  We got it with the Hot n Juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  It comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  It was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  Just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries.  Maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  They were soggy and gross.\n\nThis is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  I would definitely come here again.  Do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!
