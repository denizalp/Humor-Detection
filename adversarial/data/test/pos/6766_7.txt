LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME!!\n\nWent mid May for my girlfriends bachlorette, had VIP seating (sat center right), and went along for the ride.\n\nOk, the guys were good looking but that's it..\n\nVIP is soooo not worth it. Especially if you're not older, white, or have blond hair. You get no love.. not even eye contact.. My girls have never felt so discriminated. It wasn't just our group, there was a group of Latina ladies next to us and the MC guy points in the direction of one of the ladies next to us (she happened to be the bachlorette), she stands up and heads towards him and he like gives her this weird look and tells her NOT YOU and pulls some blond lady towards the stage. Home girl looked pissed.. \n\nThey need to update the cheesy montage in the beginning, lower the prices on their watered down drinks, revamp their venue and learn to be nice.\n\nWould not recommend to anyone. Just go to Chippendales!!!
