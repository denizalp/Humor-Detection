This location is the second one of its kind, in conjunction with Heavenly Delights on yonge and bantry. In addition to being a bakery, Negin offers a variety of coffee and premium teas with infused flavours. I sampled both the earl grey tea and the heavenly cream black tea. The scent  of the heavenly cream was out of this world. Paired with a delicious tart pomegranate mousse cake slice, the combination was divine.\n\nNegin's Bakery also offers sandwiches and healthy salads in a cute lettuce bowl. One can choose from a selection of salads: egg, tuna, russian olivia, garden, mango and grape, as well as raspberry and spinach. All fresh and made on the premises. \n\nThe atmosphere is open and friendly, a great place to stop by for a cuppa and a biscuit. Staff is extremely friendly and hospitable, and are very helpful in explaining the items in each of their desserts.
