Background: I am 25 years old. I went to Vegas for my first time in July 2011, and Tryst was my first place ever ordering bottle service in a nightclub.  For a list of FAQ's about Vegas Nightclubs, refer to JackColton.com.  It was very helpful.  \n\nAnyways, I went to Tryst on a Thursday night.  It was me, and two of my best friends.  I reserved us a table with bottle service through Tryst's website.  It was very easy to do, they emailed me right back, told me the price, where to check-in, etc.\n\nWhen checking-in: Get there pretty early, look for a guy with a clipboard, and tell him your name (it was that simple).  They will escort you to your table.  Our table was right off the waterfall.  It was a bit secluded from the rest of the nightclub, but we didn't mind.  The tables near the waterfall are actually outside, so it was nice to get a breeze from the air and waterfall.  Our waitress was super polite, and waited on us hand and foot.  Anything we needed, she was willing to help.  \n\nAttire: Once again this was our first night in a club.  We just wore nice jeans, a button down (bradley cooper shirts as we like to call them), and some dress shoes.  No need to over do it and dress like you're Gordon Gecko from Wallstreet.  Keep in mind, Vegas in July is really fucking hot.  Dress nice, but comfortable.  If you wear a blazer, you'll be sweatin in no time.  If you roll up in some gym shoes and a Cubs hat, you will probably be asked to leave. \n\nWhat we ordered: Since we are 3 irish boys from Chicago....we ordered Jack Daniels.  The bottle is a Liter, not a 750ml (a fifth).  We got to choose 3 mixers which they will replenish for you throughout the night.  Not sure if they have 1.75L (what the college kids call a \"handle\") but i bet it's really pricey.\n\nPrice: $450.  \nWhat does this get you?  Free entry into the club.  By-pass the long line.  A table which is yours for the entire night.  A bottle of your choice.  This does not include tip.  We tipped just over 20% - we gave $100.  Total bill: $550...split 3 ways = $183 per person.\nNOTE: When you reserve a table for bottle service, they have a 3 person limit per bottle.  This may be different from male to female, but if you have a group of lets say....5 guys...you will probably have to buy 2 bottles in order to have the table. \n\nTryst had an extensive bottle list, but being this was our first night in Vegas, we wanted to get completely trashed.  Whiskey did just that.  After about 3 hours we witnessed some kid jumping into the Tryst Pool and then getting thrown out.  That was hilarious cuz we found out his name, started chanting \"KYLE!! KYLE!!! KYLE!!\" which only egged him on.  I watched my friend grind on some washed-up broads in their 40s, and needless to say I captured it all on camera.  Best of all, we made good friends with the bouncer in our area, and he gave us a card for a limo driver.  This limo driver picked us up for FREE and drove us wherever we asked.  I believe the bouncer's name was Jose - really nice guy, very helpful.\n\nAll together Tryst is a very nice club.  I give it five stars because it's actually easier to talk.  The music is loud, but it's only really loud in the main dance area.  It was nice to actually be able to talk to everyone around our table and not have to shout in their ear.
