I was on this side of town and happened to stop in here for a wired Xbox controller so I can use it for pc.\n\n I was not greeted when I entered, just stared down. I asked one of the cashiers for assistance getting my controller due to it being locked up and he did not seem very thrilled. Once I got my controller I browsed around the store for a bit and made my way over to check out.\n\n I was then waiting in front of the cashier with Nobody in front of me for about 5 minutes. He was too busy texting to ring me up. After my purchase was made I didn't even get a farewell from any of the team members. \n\nI will not be coming back to this location and wouldn't recommend coming to this one due to the lack in customer service.
