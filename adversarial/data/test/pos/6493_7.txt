At this point I would like to give them no points if possible. We drove 30 minutes from the south of Las Vegas to come up here, because when we checked yesterday they had 50 Shades Free playing at 7pm and Jumamji playing at 7pm. We wanted both movies really close, since my husband would take the little ones to see Jumanji and me and my daughter watching 50 Shades Free. Not to mention we were super pissed, this never happened to us. Must say we checked yesterday and the girl on the ticket both said they cancelled it overnight. Thank You Cannery for a waist of gas to come all that way. There are still people that plan ahead and don't make last minute decisions!
