Avoid this place! We had a friend refer us and we signed up, but went back the same day to cancel. They make it sound like you only have to pay one month up front but processed two. Also, that you are getting a great special that they never run, but after talking to people that go there, the $59\/month special is all the time. Realizing it was an impulse decision. We couldn't cancel because the manager wasn't there. So, we gave it a shot for a month, didn't use it or when we tried to schedule something, they are always booked up. Used it once in 60 days, called to see if they can fax a cancellation. Nope, you have to come in. Went in to cancel and the manager wasn't there. It's really easy to sign up but almost impossible to cancel. \n\nNow that I think about it, I remember our first visit and a lady was trying to suspend her membership because she was pregnant and didn't want to take any chances, plus under the advice of her doctor. The bubbly girl behind the desk, says all our products are natural and it won't affect you. This 20 something girl is going to advise against what this mom to be wants and what her doctor suggested. Ridiculous!
