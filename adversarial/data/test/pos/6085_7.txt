I like this location. It is easy to get to, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I had a color issue, and I needed to fix it. I asked the guy working here his advice, confirming my ideas on how to correct my color. This made me feel much more confident in what I was doing. \n\nThis location is always really well stocked, clean and bright. I love that you can finally swipe your own credit card, instead of giving it to the clerk.
