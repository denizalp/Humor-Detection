Well, I don't want to be too negative but I probably won't be returning for a massage here. Although I have to be fair and say that maybe I will one day but I will just try another therapist. First thing, I arrive at least 10 minutes before my appointment and filled out the paperwork since I was a new client. My appointment was at 4 o'clock and I was not greeted by my therapist until several minutes after four. I just made a mental note of it because I wanted to make sure that I got my full-time in. She was very nice and pleasant and I'm not going to say her name because I don't want to be too negative. The massage was just OK. And I am definitely in a position to evaluate because I get massages at least once or twice per month and I have been getting them for over 15 years. I happen to come to this business today only because I was given a gift certificate. The first thing I noticed during my massage is that she uses entirely too much oil or lotion I'm not quite sure what it was. But every few seconds I could hear her squirting more onto her hands. By the end of my massage I felt just slimy and gooey. Also she got some in my hair which I guess can't be entirely avoided but it was way more than I'm accustomed to having in my hair at the end of a massage. The second thing that I noticed is that I had scheduled a Swedish massage but it felt like she was trying to do a deep tissue massage in some areas and then not really a Swedish massage in the other areas but just more pushing and rubbing. I know that may not make sense but it didn't feel like any other massage I've  ever been given. Also there was too much digging with her thumb. The last concern I had is that it seems Ike they book clients back to back (I mean factory mill type). And I didn't see her wash her hands in between the time that she walked her last client out and greeted me. I noticed that the bathroom is way down at the end of the hall but I also know that they need time to change the sheets on the tables so I'm not sure how or when she could've had time to go wash her hands.\nAll in all, I was not satisfied with this massage. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. I hate to sound mean because I know that this place has a lot of good reviews. Perhaps I am a snob and I will admit that. I did leave her a generous tip because I always tip well unless the service is just horrible.
