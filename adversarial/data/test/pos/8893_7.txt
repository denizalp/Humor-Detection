We stopped here after a trip to the Dells.\n\nTo see such a beautiful brewery in the heart of Waunakee is so great. The space is beautiful and the owners were even dining next to us, the founder checked on our table after they had finished eating.\n\nThe food menu may feel limited to some, but it actually narrowed down some nice choices that fit everyone in our party's needs.\n\nI ordered the Surf & Smash, a burger with homemade hushpuppies, slaw, and aoli. You're thinking, huspuppies on a burger? Get rid of the picture of deep-fried cornmeal ball, popular in the South out of your head. These are formed closer to corned beef hash in appearance. Think a smashed crab cake, made up of a blend of shrimp and crab. The burger was very good, tender beef and the hushpuppies gave it an added flavor.\n\nI loved that the house fries were a mixture of sweet potato and regular fries. They have a nice selection of their own brew, only a couple of IPAs though with ABVs hovering around 6.5%, if you're a snob. Most of the beer ran around $5 for a pour which was decent.\n\nOf of our companions ordered the Fish & Chips and it came with a Orange wedge, which was off-putting.
