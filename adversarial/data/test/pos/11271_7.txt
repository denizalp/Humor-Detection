My friend got tickets to this show so we made our way to Planet Hollywood to check it out. \nEveryone that worked here was super nice, I wasn't feeling well and I guess you could see it in my face because one of the performers (clown) came up to me before the show and offered me some water. I thought that was super nice but I guess all clowns are nice :)\nNow lets get to the show, before it even starts a waitress came around taking drink orders which I thought was a great idea and wished more shows did this.\nI have to say the show was great and touched on a little bit of everything Vegas is known for. I really enjoyed the whole show and had a smile on the whole time.
