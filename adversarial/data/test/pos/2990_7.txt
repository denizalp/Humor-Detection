Beginner's luck!\n\nMy first visit here and I was pretty lucky!\n\nExcellent service from the dealers and pit bosses.\n\nThe place is a decent size and has tons of parking.\n\nTons of slots and a good amount of table games.\n\nI hit a few full houses and flushes within 10 hands!\n\nI'll be back for sure.
