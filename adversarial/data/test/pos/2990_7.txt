Dragon Meet Phoenix,(a bad-ass name for a dish if there ever was one, it conjures images of Toho monster flicks), 3 egg rolls, an order of fried dumplings, and Hawaii Five-O certainly made our evening labor-free. \n\nWhich one was the dragon and which one was the phoenix, I'm not sure of, but this was a mash-up of tempura shrimp and General Tso's Chicken that worked rich, meaty, syrupy magic o'er top some flawless white rice. \n\nThe dumpings were quintessentially filling, sticky, packed with ground pork, yet missed something unnameable that dumplings from other restaurants have in spades. \n\nThe egg rolls were a bit boring and possessed little in the way of sapor. \n\nSorry for the brief review, but there ain't much to write about here other than it is hidden in yet another shopping center. Non-descript is the word of the evening. \n\nP.S. There is no dine-in.
