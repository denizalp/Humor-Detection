Holly crap, this place serves one of the best, scratch that, the best sandwich I have had in vegas.  I love the Pauly Walnuts and it has capicola, prosciutto, and genoa salami with sharp provolone (top notch quality). They serve it with lettuce and marinated tomatoes and the best part is the delicious hard roll it's served on.  It is a perfect sandwich roll, delicious mild sour flavor, not to hard, and chewy.  (I love bread)\n\nI am from San Francisco and I love deli sandwiches but have never found anything that I have liked in town until now (I love a bobbie but thats completely different).   I think this place only has italian meats and cheeses so don't come here looking for a bacon and turkey sandwich.  Also the sandwiches with the artisan meats and cheeses are just a tad under 9 bucks but it's worth it because you figure those ingredients are expensive, and they don't skimp so I feel its a fair price.  All the hot sandwiches like cheese steaks and meatballs are actually a buck or 2 cheaper.  \n\nI had the cheese steak and I wasn't crazy about it but I did have a made to order mini canolli for a buck and it was fantastic, they also sell great gelato by the pint.  I gave them a 5 because the cold cut sandwich was that great and they were very friendly, and the canolli is awesome for a small one buck dessert.  I can't wait to try the meatball sub after reading the other reviews.
