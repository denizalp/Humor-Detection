One star is too high of a rating for this place. For starters, the actual office is part of the hospital and the number to the building can't be seen from the street. After passing the location twice, I decided to venture into the parking lot and putt around until I found the actual building. Upon arriving, I went into the office and approached the front desk at 914am where I met the simpleton working registration; I believe her name was Allissya Flowers. This woman was absolutely awful! I let her know that I have an appointment at 930am and she proceeds to tell me I'm late... I said, the location was difficult to find but I'm technically not late, my appointment was at 930; she says nothing. She then slams a clipboard on the counter and says, \"You have twelve pages to fill out, you better get started.\" After about 5 minutes, she then calls my name from across the room and says, I need whatever you have filled out so that I can get it entered in the system. I walk up, detach the documents that I have filled out, and she proceeds to do one of those, half-a** sigh\/cough things indicating disgust in what I had done. I again go and sit down to fill out the rest of the documents and after five minutes, she calls me name again. I say, \"Do you need me?\" and she says, \"Come here\" once again with attitude. \n\nAt this point I'm annoyed but I approach the desk where she says, \"You need to pay your co-pay now.\" I say, \"I don't have a co-pay for a general health screening, this is just a check-up.\" She says, \"You're establishing care and are required to pay us $30. I said, \"I'm going to call Aetna because I shouldn't have a co-pay for this visit.\" The simpleton then says, \"Well you're already late, that's going to take more time.\" Following this comment I told her that I didn't appreciate her attitude and that I won't give my business to a place that treats their patients this way. I also told her, that if she is going to treat patients the way she had treated me, that she would be out of a job since without patients, the practice has no use for her. I asked for my documents back and left, again with her giving me attitude and making this known through annoying sounds with her mouth and breathing.\n\nI will not go back and I suggest that others don't as well. If the doctor's who work at this practice actually hire and keep this simpleton employed, they must also think that her behavior is acceptable.
