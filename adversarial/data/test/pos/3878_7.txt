This guy is the best and the worst. Three stars for Jesus Guy. \n\nWhen he yells \"Praise Jesus\" it always startles me. Maybe I'm the devil? It's always fun to bring a tourist really close to him who doesn't know he's about to randomly shout very, VERY loudly. The best. \n\nHe's a Toronto staple. A true institution. \n\nI wonder if he's friends with the Cabbagetown cart lady? I hope so.
