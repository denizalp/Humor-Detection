3.5 stars... very cool spot to chill on a sunny day\n\nThis Jimmy's location was such a pleasant surprise.  With most spots in Kensington, you're expect smaller or cramped spaces with not a lot of light.  Imagine my surprise to walk in and spot a large outdoor patio in the back!  \n\nJimmy's is a local coffee brand that has a few spots around Toronto.  I would say that out of all the spots I've tried in Kensington, the atmosphere here is definitely a plus.  It's chill and relaxed with a lot of varying spaces to sit and enjoy a cup.  On a Sunday morning, there was a decent amount of the lap top horde sitting and taking up an entire table.  Since they had their patio open, it doubles the sitting space and the back patio is just wonderful. It's clean and has a lot of shaded parts in addition to tables just baking in the sun.\n\nThe coffee served here is fairly consistent to the other spots I've tried around Toronto.  It's solid and above average... they do have seasonal offerings.  It seems they were starting to do their cold brew offering.  Summer is coming! I stuck to my favourite flat white to determine the flavour of the beans and see if I like it a lot.\n\nService here was quicker than their Ossington spot as they had 3 people behind the counter working the cash or pulling the shots.  I think their prices are very fair as well.  You won't feel gouged when you pay.  You do have to pay extra for things like Almond milk but I think it was only $0.50 extra.  So very reasonable.  \n\nFlat White - This was not a real flat white as the drink is definitely sweetened or had some sort of syrup added.  This was a bit of a surprise.  I also noticed that the foam was overfrothed and the actual drink itself was not very hot.  Aside from these details, I found the drink fairly enjoyable for a flavoured coffee drink.  The coffee taste wasn't so bold but it wasn't acidic either... though hard to tell with it being sweetened.   I wouldnt think this is the best cup in Kensington but if it's the price to pay to sit in a nice back patio, it would be worth it.  3\/5\n\nOverall, the space in the summer is a great spot to be in if you just want to chill in Kensington for a while.  I can imagine this getting really full of people once June hits.  Hopefully if I come back, I can still snag a seat.
