Had a late night craving. It was after midnight but they offer individual slices up til 2am. One velvet rope there and you have to guess which way to go in and order. I asked for one slice, pepperoni with sausage. I was told I had to take whatever was coming out of the oven. Okay?? Lucky there was a pepperoni coming out sans the sausage. 1 slice $5.50. The slice was a nice but 3.5 piece of pepperoni doesn't do it. They skimp on the toppings. For 5 bucks, the toppings should be plentiful, but this is not the case. Overall the taste was average. 6 out of 10 Nothing special. The crust was thin, crunchy and good. However, you will get much better at the Cosmo next door with their secret pizza place. Next time, I will take the walk there to satisfy my craving.
