I have very mixed feelings about this place.\n\nSince I'm not married to a Russian oligarch or a member of the Mafiosi and I don't see that happening anytime soon either, a plebeian like me has never bought any items of clothing or shoes or purses here.(Hermes Birkin bag at $15 000 anyone?). \n\nThat said, I have come here to buy my absolute favorite brand of makeup, Nars Cosmetics which has a cult-like following among fashionistas and girly-girls the world over. The girls at the Nars counter have always been nice and super helpful to me so no complaints there. Yeah, they are expensive but totally worth every penny.  Also the ladies over at the Creed perfume counter were very helpful. Before I decide to plunk down a  few hundred dollars on something, I definitely want to sample it first and they were more than happy to oblige my curiosity.\n\nAlso, at one point I was seriously thinking of buying a Hermes scarf, one of those things that literally never go out of fashion. Since I can't afford to buy one brand new ($800+), I went on ebay looking for a slightly used, vintage print one. I called up the Hermes boutique at Holt Renfrew to ask someone if they could give me some pointers on how to spot a fake online. They went over and beyond that. They asked if I would like to come in sometime and one of their associates would explain to me what differentiates a real Hermes item from a fake one. I took a print-out of the scarf I was eyeing on ebay and spent a pleasant afternoon with an associate who showed me the ropes. Finally another sales associate gifted me with a set of  vials which had a sampling of  various Hermes perfumes and said maybe if I changed my mind one of these days, I may come back and buy a real, new scarf.  I doubt that will happen anytime soon, but the gesture was pure class nonetheless.\n\nGo to Holt to stroll and look if you can and if some of the obnoxious sales associates in the boutiques don't drive you out first to get ideas of what you really want. Then go on ebay, net-a-porter.com, theoutnet.com or even online Black Friday sales for retailers like Henri Bendels, Neiman Marcus,  to get the same stuff a cheaper prices and with virtually none of the attitude.
