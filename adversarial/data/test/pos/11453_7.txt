I came out here for a peaceful weekend\nWith my family. When we got here bell desk, valet and check in where awesome! The pool area is another story, I literally asked 4 times for a beer we sat there for over 2hrs no one ever asked if we wanted something to drink or eat. As we saw waiters running back and forth to take care of what I'm guessing are more important guest. I then approached a guy and said can I get a beer?? He said yea never came back, I walked over to the bar found him 30 min later and said can I have that beer now?? He said my bad and I finally got me one. Then 30 min later I waived down 2 other waitresses that told me it's not there area and said they would get someone for me. That person came 15 min later without an apology or even a smile. I don't know what the deal is, being a minority and seeing every bobby, Todd and Trevor get there food and orders right away makes me sick to my stomach. I love the hotel but things like this remind me of how people will always treat what they perceive as more important by the color of there skin, fyi red rock staff I probably have more money and tip better than the people u are kissing up to
