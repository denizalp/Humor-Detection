So don't judge me but I have never in life had Little Caesars Pizza until recently.\n\nI will say that I definitely wasn't missing out on anything big or grand. However, for $5 for a Hot & Ready Large Pepperoni Pizza it was a good deal.\n\nThe pizza itself had way more pepperoni on it than I thought it would. Definitely a lot of bread and not a super cheesy pizza, but for $5 I am not going to cry about it. It fed my family for dinner one night and at a great price if you ask me.\n\nWe also got a side of the cheesy bread sticks and those were pretty good. \n\nThe location itself is pretty busy, so the parking lot can sometimes be tight. And you are bound to see some interesting characters.
