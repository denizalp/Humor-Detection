Sometimes I drive around aimlessly looking for food because I don't know what i want to eat.  I have weird moods where anything and nothing sounds good.  But this time i got lucky because this place is all about Ssambap!\n\nIt was empty when i came in, and the restaurant is fairly big.  The server was nice and gave me 2 menus.  I'd asked for Barley Tea, but they have Solomon Tea instead.  The menus were a bit confusing at first.  There are many \"courses\" to choose from as well ala cart stuff.  I ended up with the Spicy Chicken (Dakgalbi) Beauty Course and an order of Bibim Noodles (Japchae).  I was under the impression that these courses would be sent out in intervals, but instead they're all served together.  Should have known better, this is a Korean restaurant after all. And when I saw all the leafy stuff, that's when i knew this was my fav!  \n\n[I was first introduced to Ssambap (Lettuce wrap usually involving meat and rice) at an earlier age.  My friend's mom would set up this whole table full of different type of Banchan and lettuces with a portable grill in the middle, so we can cook while eat.  Most of the time it's Korean Short Ribs (Kalbi), and by itself it already has a tremendous amount of flavor.  That's why it's accompany with rice and Banchan (side dishes) to pick at.\nFurthermore, by adding lettuces and Ssamjang (Korean Chili Paste + Fermented Soy Bean Paste + etc), you're able to enhance your dining experience by combining everything into a compact bite. I almost aways ask for a side of lettuce leaf at every KBBQ I go to, so I was thrilled to know that KG offers a wide variations of wraps] \n\nMy Beauty Course with Spicy Ck $14.95\n-Salad [which is all the Ssam bap: Red Lettuce Leaf, Steamed Cabbage, Pickled Kombu (edible Kelp), Pickled Daikons, Baby Bok Choi, Baby Butter Cabbage? Sesame Leaf (Shiso aka Kaenip aka Perilla), Red Cabbage, Carrots and Celeries]  w\/ side of Ssamjang (red bean paste + soybean paste etc)\n-Korean Fermented Bean Soup (Daenjang jjigae)\n-Bowl of White Rice\n-Banchan;  in my case it was Korean Bean Sprouts, Kimchee, and some type of eggplants\n-Korean Style Spicy Chicken (Dakgalbi)\n\nThe Dakgabli was delicious.  The chicken had some nice charred to it and the sauce was spicy.  It was good enough to eat by itself and rice, but i had a whole boat of lettuces that i didn't want to go to waste.  So i made use of all it, and by the time i use them all up i was full enough to take home half an order of both the Dakgalbi and Japchae.  The Japchae with the burger pattie was underseasoned, and for 6.99 (lunch menu) it was ok. \n\nOn my next visit i got the Korean Style Rib Barbecued Beef $19 (Kalbi).  It's an ala cart item, so they charge $2.99 for the side of Ssam (wrapped).  The Kalbi was surprisingly pathetic.  For a Korean establishment the flavor and quality was far below standard. But because of the assortment of Ssam I was able to salvage this meal.  Pretty much every Korean restaurants have lettuce wraps, but KG offerings are just on another level!\n\nIf you're new to Ssambap I suggest start off with the basic.  On a lettuce leaf, dab your protein into the Ssamjang, and add little bit of rice. Next, try adding in a slice Kimchee, or my favorite, pickled radish to your Ssam.  Make sure you don't overstuff it because you're supposed to fold this all into one bite.  Also don't limit yourself to just wrapping. Pick at your food in between so the tongue is always entertain.  Build your wraps differently with diffErent sides, and before you know it you'll be getting full while having fun creating your own flavor bomb. \n\n*note*  It can be consider courting if you make a Ssambap for someone else while you eat.  So don't wash your hands to see how much they like you back
