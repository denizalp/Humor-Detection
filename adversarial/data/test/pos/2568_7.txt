Troutman's is the best NC BBQ I spent the first 9 years of my life here at  least once a week and the best part is that nothing has changed I love going back to troutmans, no one recognizes me anymore but the food is still excellent. Just because it isn't fancy or new does not mean it isn't good. Sometimes the old way is the old way because it is the best way.
