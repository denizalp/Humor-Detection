Nice clean spacious room with window that could actually be opened :) 24\/7 access to free snacks (coffee, pop, granola bars, fruit, juice, milk, candy...) in a card key accessed large nook over lobby.  Free wifi, handy desktops and printer in snack nook.\n\nKind of difficult to find if you don't realize it is on the campus of the Thunderbird School of Global Management.  Felt very safe. Security is good. Staff is friendly. Guests are normal people (sometimes, this is not a given).  Great value for price.  If I ever have to stay in a crappy suburb of Phoenix again, this would be my first choice.
