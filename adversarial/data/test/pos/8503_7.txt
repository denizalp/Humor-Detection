This is down the street from my parents home and our go-to dessert spot when I'm in town visiting them. This business is owned my some local Italians and they have a wide variety of homemade Gelato's and italian pastries. \n\nThey have 20+ flavors and always have a few limited edition seasonal flavors depending on the time of the year. It's a popular spot and the lines can get long but they go by quickly. \n\nMy favorite is the Amagala (rum and raisins) and coconut or peanut butter. My dad always goes for the whiskey cream (shocker ). \n\nTry this place out, if you like good gelato I don't think you'll be disappointed.
