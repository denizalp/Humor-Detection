H&M is one of the worst stores out there. My poor elderly mother thinks that I like this store that is why every Christmas I end up getting a $250 gift card and have no idea what to buy because the clothes in this store are of such poor quality after 3 washes it has either fallen apart, or the colour ends up looking as washed out as Lindsay Lohan's life.\n\nThis particular H&M is the worst, there's way too many basics and garbage that high school kids can afford to buy with their pocket money. The store is always a distaster area, the change room lines are too long, there's just not enough of anything worthwhile in this store.\n\nI came out with my $250 gift cert which if I can't sell on craigslist, I'll just give it to a random coke head. At least the card will be somewhat useful to someone.
