Many Holiday inn Express hotels are very similar. After ten years getting a little tired and in need of some updating.  This one has just been through an update and it was nice and the price was right.\n\nGood beds and linens, free Wi Fi, and a really nice well stocked breakfast with OK coffee.\n\nThe missing star is for no cold water - plenty of hot water but in my room all the water ran hot.  Is that because Phoenix such a ridiculously hot hell hole?
