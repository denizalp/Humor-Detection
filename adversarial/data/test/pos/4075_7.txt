My parents were super excited to come here for lunch. It's because it's an excellent price for hordes of food, seafood to be exact. But with only 4 people, it was SO MUCH FOOD. \n\nWhat they offer is fresh crab, lobster, or fish. Set menus range from $48 (2 people) to $400 or more (for 10 people). You'll pay extra if you want Alaskan King Crab rather than the small Vancouver King Crab. Nonetheless, they take all parts of the crab or lobster and make a meal out of it. \n\nThe Vancouver Crab meal comes with Congee, crab knuckles, braised crab head and claws, and e-fu noodles. Although it said it was for 2 people. it was more than enough food for the 4 of us. Parents also wanted a lobster, and made sense to get another $48 meal and take the rest home. Comes with also congee, noodles and a whole lobster.It's a lot of food. \n\nThe menu is a bit confusing. They have the set menu, but also a la carte at the back. On the set menu they say you'll get a 2.5 lb crab. On the a la carte menu, it says king crab (doesn't say what kind) is $16\/lb. If you do the math, the $48 meal sounds really appealing. \nThey come and show you the crab you're going to get. They ONLY had a 2lb crab (instead of 2.5) and they could make it up by giving us another 2 lb and adding another $26 to the meal! when we refused and asked for a substitute, it was a big deal. \n\nFun for the entire family, espeically if in the mood for seafood.
