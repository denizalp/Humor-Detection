You know, I keep going back to Wine Bar and each time I leave more and more disappointed. There is something about it...I'm not sure if it's the lackluster waitstaff or the wobbly tables or something else.\n\nI WANT to like it...It's got a cute patio and a big tree and italian lights.\n\nBut, there is one problem on my last visit from which this place will never recover.  And that problem is PUBIC HAIR.  In the food.  Seriously, folks.  Can't make this stuff up.\n\nNot only was there *clearly* a hair on our pizza, upon alerting the waitress, she responds \"I'm sure that's not a pubic hair.\" She fetched her manager, who came over to our table and says \"I'll see what I can do\".  Not \"sorry\" or \"let me take care of this for you\".\n\nThey removed a small percentage of our bill, but we still managed to leave paying around a hundred bucks.  That's $100.  For pubic hair pizza.\n\nI'd be embarrassed if this were my restaurant.
