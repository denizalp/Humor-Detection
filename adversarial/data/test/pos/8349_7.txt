$6 for one scoop of gelato?  Give me a f*cking break.\n\nJust because it's located in the Venetian in the faux-San Marco square doesn't mean that you can get away with charging highway robbery prices for inauthentic, mediocre gelato.\n\nI tried two samples here: their plain yogurt and their pistachio.  The texture of the gelato was like ice cream, and it was icy.  Authentic gelato is denser than ice cream.  And the flavor--the pistachio tasted artificial and had a hint of apple (?!) and a bitter aftertaste.  The yogurt was just too sweet and creamy--lacked the taste of yogurt.  Haagen-Daz is so much better--and that's not even real gelato!\n\nI know eateries in Vegas tend to be overpriced, but this is ridiculous.  $5.50 for one scoop?  And $1 extra for a cone?  Keep in mind that in Venice, a scoop is only 1-2 euros.  But even in the states, it's usually about $3-4.  But $6?!  The only reason why this place does business is because it exploits the unsuspecting well-heeled tourists who think their gelato must be good because it's located in the Venetian.\n\nTo top it off, their service was unfriendly and slow.   I guess it's only appropriate that this place is in Vegas, since Cocolini is the whore of gelatterias.
