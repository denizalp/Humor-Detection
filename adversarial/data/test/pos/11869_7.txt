Such a disappointment! I contacted this nursery because we needed a LOT of yard work done on our 20 year old yard of a home we just purchased. It was to be a long extensive line of work for them to do. I would imagine any landscaper\/nursery would be interested in creating our dream yard with us and the money that would have brought to them.\n\nFirst, we went there to purchase some yard plants (for pots) after we closed on our home. We were so excited. Their plant selection is not that great or imaginative. Plant sizes were on the smaller end and the soil in the pots was filled with lots of \"filler\" stuff. However, we bought plants and had a great conversation with Tammy.  We also inquired as to whether someone would like to come out and go over ALL the work we needed done (new stone, new lights, new watering, new plants...the works). She excitedly said \"Sure!\" and set up an appointment for Frank to come out. And he did come out right away...that's where the story unfortunately ends.\n\nTwo and a half weeks later...no word from Tammy....no word from Frank. Numerous phone calls were made to them with their promise to have it to us as soon as possible. The final deadline was to be this past Monday. No answer or no information. Finally, my hubby called them to tell them they had until Noon on Monday to get back to us. Tammy finally called my phone (and not my husband's, whom they had been working with) to tell me they are now \"not interested\" in the work. What a waste of my time and theirs. \n\nI don't imagine they even care much about their awful reputation because there are no replies on the scathing reviews. It surprises me that a business could run this awful. So unprofessional. Looking forward to finding someone more caring who would like the money for this work.\n\nShame on them.
