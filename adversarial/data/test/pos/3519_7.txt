Tried something new last night (by eating healthy!!! lol.) When I first told my fiancé about it, he was reluctant to go. He kept asking if he was going to be served tofu XD But after seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp, I'm confident that even if we had to eat tofu, it is still going to be amazing balls.\n\nRestaurant is run by Chef Dan and his hardworking crew. It is a small place on the block, SE of University\/Dundas. Don't be fooled by the unattractive name or décor of restaurant, this place is definitely a hidden gem for good eats in downtown Toronto!\n\nFood is fresh and delicious, presentation is impressive and they give you a huge portion too! 3 course prix available daily for lunch ($20), and for dinner ($25)... not just during Summerlicious! Unfortunately, no liquor licence. So, we just drank water (healthier choice, ya? lol). Nevertheless, still worth checking out :D\n\n All the items we ordered really stood out:\n- Spicy lamb rolls - Must order! Filling was really flavourful, and had a super crunchy exterior.\n- Butter chicken drumsticks in martini glass - Very nice presentation, meat falls off the bones!\n- Build your own Salmon flay burger - Great flavours altogether, salmon was juicy and cooked perfectly :)\n- Cracked spices chicken supreme - Mountain full of veggies, chicken was tender and well -seasoned\n- Creme caramel ice cream - Smoky and sweet goodness paired with fresh berries, I want more!\n- Alfonso mango panna cotta - Very smooth and creamy, and the white chocolate chips were a nice touch!\n\nI will definitely revisit this place again without a doubt!\nHappy healthy eating :D
