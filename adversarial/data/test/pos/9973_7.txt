Met my older brother here for his birthday this winter. I had been once before so I already knew the lay of the land. It can be a little disorienting the first time around. It is huge! And ever so beautiful. Ornate doesn't always mean schmaltzy. \n\nThere is so much to do here. Shopping, shows, gondola rides - nice to get taken for a different kind of ride in Vegas. Food, food and more food.. Did I mention food? Yes. Good stuff.\n\nWe splurged and got a two bedroom suite. Honestly, the master bathroom was almost as big as my apartment. And the view of Las Vegas was breathtaking. The little touches made it all the much better.\n\nAnd now for a couple of helpful hints: Bring your own water. Unless paying $6 for a bottle of water doesn't frost your cupcake. Get some ice, fill the sink with ice and put the bottles of water in. \n\nTurned out we didn't really need to do that because my dear brother lost six Gs playing blackjack. One of the floor guys came over and said, \"Rooms on us kid.\" So... lose - win. We were also given free passes to Tao. Which wasn't my bag. Had a couple of drinks and hightailed it back to the beautiful bathroom and took a nice long soak and drank a little more. Fell soundly asleep in the big, incredibly comfortable bed.\n\nNext day I had an hour long Swedish massage in the spa. I was a puddle by the time she was finished. (Note: too classy for a happy ending). But it was sweet nonetheless.\n\nBrother swore off the blackjack and we went in for a little poker (really hoping your mind doesn't go THERE). This time he didn't drink - hint. Big hand for the little lady. I won his money back. And gave it to him for his birthday. \n\nLove this place.
