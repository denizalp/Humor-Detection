Surprised out of my mind !  \n\nIn the many years I have lived in Vegas and all the visits I have paid The Orleans Casino I have never been through such a unpleasant experience.\n\n  While minding my own business in the Bourbon Street Cabaret Theatre watching the Soccer game, this extremely large elderly woman employee of the casino ( I believe her name is Dee )  Shoved her way through the seats from behind me and said to me: \" I will be coming through here make way \" as she was pushing her way unexpectedly !      There are 4 seats per table and they were all facing  forward because \"people were watching the game\" , no one was seating facing each other as per the standard seating configuration..... my seat had about 3 inches of space between the other seats and she just literally pushed her way in! \n\nStartled, I politely suggested to her that she should go through the center of the room, there were no tables or chairs or patrons and it had direct access to the tables she needed to reach. Defiantly she turned and barked at the tough guy 60 year old security guard: \" He is refusing to listen to me! \" . Mr Tough Guy then immediately launched from behind me, placed his head into my personal space next to my head and said: Listen if you do not want to cooperate you are out!  To which I just raised my hands in disbelief of what was happening.  The Woman looked at me with a \" do something punk\" grin .......really? \n\nFive minutes later, Mr Tough Guy once again rushed from behind my seat, invaded my personal space again and said to me: \" If you think this is a joke you have another thing coming to you! \"  \n\nReally? The last thing I wanted to do is get kicked out of a game I traveled all the way to the casino to see in a group of other team fans...and now I was getting harassed by the gestapo? \n\n1- Dee is abusing her power (she seemed to be a supervisor of some type) by threating patrons badly then misusing the security personnel to do her dirty work.\n\n2- The security personnel do not know that they are being manipulated by this horrible woman that most likely plays her sweet side to them all day long so she can use them at her convenience.  \n\n3- Somebody retrain security that rushing people from behind that are seating down is not just dangerous but extremely stupid! \n\nIf Dee is such a nice person, then why the hell does she need security to watch her so she can just clean up empty bottles from the tables?  The waitresses don't have security following them around, why? Because they earn their living by being polite. \n\nThat's it I vented. \n\nJust watch out for those horrible employees.
