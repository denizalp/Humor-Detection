Restaurant Week Meal #7 (Lunch for $30.13):\nAppetizer: Cantaloupe Soup OR Portabello Piccata OR Caprese Tart\n\nEntree: Roasted Breast of Chicken OR Lake Superior Whitefish OR Grilled Skirt Steak\n\nDessert: Coconut Caramel Cake OR Seasonal Sorbet Trio\n\nSince I was already getting the steak, my friend opted to get a burger and truffle fries instead of doing RW. I was asked if I've tried Olives before and I haven't...we had bread service and that's when I realized why I haven't been here - I'm allergic to olives! Too late, we already placed our order.\n\nCantaloupe Soup:\nWith almonds and minted creme fraiche. I like cantaloupe so this was an easy choice plus, it's different. A nice, cool and refreshing soup. It's lightly salted so it's not like eating dessert. It's best eaten with a spoon which the server didn't give me. 4\/5\n\nGrilled Skirt Steak:\nCame with Italian sausage mashed potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, Pinot Noir reduction topped with watercress salad. I love steak but this one was not that good especially if they don't give you a steak knife. 3.5\/5\n\nCoconut Caramel Cake:\nCame with chocolate malt ice cream and coconut brittle. I'm not a fan of coconut but I was not in the mood for sorbet either.  The ice cream was very good. The cake was like a deconstructed macaroon. Not too bad. 4\/5\n\nOlive's Burger and Truffle Fries:\nDressings on the side: pickles, tomatoes and onions. This usually comes with Parmesan Fries but my friend got it substituted with Truffle Fries. His first burger was cooked medium-well...and dry so he sent it back.  The second burger was perfectly medium-rare. Tasty and juicy. The fries were perfect! 4.5\/5\n\nDespite the utensil snafu, Olives has good things going on.  The burger and truffle fries...yum! They have a nice view of the Miracle Mile and the Fountains of Bellagio if you sit at the patio. There are birds waiting for a free meal but they're not pesky.
