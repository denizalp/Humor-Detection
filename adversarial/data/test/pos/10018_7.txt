Look, the place is a PITA.   Nothing is organized by size.  The customer service is non existent.  The place is a dump and the ladies room smells.  You're gonna wait on line to check out AND wait in line to try on clothes.  You'll find beautiful stuff dirty and damaged.  You're gonna get frustrated, maybe even pissed off.\n\nAnd, if you know how to shop, you're gonna get the best bargains imaginable!\n\nSO worth it, if you have patience and time to spare.
