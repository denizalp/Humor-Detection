3 words.\n\nPORK. BELLY. BOWL. \n\nEnd of review. \n\nOk, just kidding. This is my first time here at this location but have been to the Spring Mountain one numerous times. I must confess, I have only had one of their ramen bowls and that was a Spicy Tonkatsu Bowl while my wife got the small Pork Belly Bowl. Once I tasted her Pork Bowl, I had to get one. Good thing they have a small size because while I was waiting for my order, I literally finished my wife's Pork Bowl. So of course I gave her my order when it got there. Yes, I still finished my bowl as well.\n\nWhats so fancy about the Pork Belly Bowl you say? Well, its basically thick cut bacon that I think has been marinated in some kind of soy sauce and just grilled enough for to be cooked but not to the point that it gets crispy. They put it on top of a bowl of rice accompanied by shredded green onion and pickled ginger. I usually throw some sesame seeds and a mixture of red pepper flakes on top of there that is provided in shakers right on your table. This gives your dish even more good flavor. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are two sizes, Small ($3.95) and Regular ($5.75). I usually get the regular and most of the time it fills me up. On those times that I am really hungry, I have them add a side of Chasu Pork ($2.50) on top of it. If you refer to my pic, the Pork Chasu is basically 4 thinly sliced pieces of Pork Chop that is cooked the same way as the pork belly. \n\nI like this location slightly better than the one in Chinatown because its almost twice as big so waiting is not as long. Of course the thing that takes it down to a 4 is that its way further away from my house. So whenever I am in the area, Pork Belly in my belly is a real possibility. \n\nIn closing, sorry if you are looking for a great review for ramen. Yes, its still available and you can still order it. Did I mention just how good the Pork Belly Bowl is?\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #116 \"Get in my belly you Pork Belly!\"
