Yelp has led me to another amazing joint for food.\n\nI went to Mariscos Playa Hermosa with family for my brother's birthday and this place blew my socks off. The food and staff were equally responsible for why I left wishing this gem was closer to my residence. From beginning to end, our visit was great. \n\nFor the food, we started with guac. and a shrimp cocktail. The guac. was so flavorful and man, they jammed so much shrimp in the great cocktail. What a start!!! Next we ordered the Molcajete Caliente (shrimp, beef, chicken, fish, octopus in a green sauce). As we were anticipating the arrival of our dish they brought us all out a complimentary ceviche tostada. This was my first ceviche and I was impressed. Not saying much though since I have nothing to compare it to :). Now for the Molcajete, I loved it so much. Every meat was perfectly cooked and the boiling hot green sauce was perfect. To go with the meat, they provide each person with their own tortillas, beans, and rice. Okay, the tortillas were good, the beans were good, but the rice was the best I have had. I just loved everything about the dish. I would eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and then do it all over again the next day.\n\nAs for service and as mentioned above, it was equally impressive. I wish I remembered the young ladies name but she provided wonderful service. She checked on us often and always did it with a smile. The staff also came in at the tail end of the meal and sang the happy birthday song to my brother. What I have never seen before is they sang it first in English and then Spanish. What a cool idea. \n\nMy family will be back again soon and you should stop in too.
