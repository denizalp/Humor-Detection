It is just a great event! From the runners to the volunteers...it all adds up to amazing! And to see the crowds cheering the runners on, spectacular! And the neighborhoods get way into it! The West end had us doing the YMCA dance today:). Thanks for another Fantastic year! We runners love you for it!!!!
