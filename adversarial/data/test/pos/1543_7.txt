If I still had young kids wanting me to take them to McDonald's I probably would appreciate this Penguin-wannabe as an alternative.  But, I don't, and I don't.\n\nThe original Penguin fit its setting.  It was a rundown dive in a rundown neighborhood with a good vibe and good \"low brow\" food.  The effort to re-create this in an upscale Huntersville shopping center seems like something in a theme park.  It lacks any authenticity.\n\nI was there on a Monday night, and it was full of families with young kids.  The bar has only three beers on tap.  I ordered a burger, a \"Maddy Patty Melt.\"  I cannot remember when I last saw a place that sold burgers without fries or some other side, and that is okay, but might the waitress not have tried a little simple upselling, like, would you like fries with that?  The burger comes out wrapped in paper, and that is the last I saw of my waitress.  The burger is supposed to be on Texas Toast, and I suppose that allows them to call whatever they want Texas Toast, but it sure looked and tasted like ordinary white bread to me.\n\nTo pay and end my meal I had to flag down the hostess\/cashier.  The place, again, was full, and perhaps for families with young children, it is a good choice.  There are better burgers at the Five Guys in the same shopping center, and several other restaurants there better than this one.
