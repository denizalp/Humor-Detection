I really like this place but they screw up some easy things which I think is problematic. \n\nWhen my cousin and I got there, we were eventually greeted by a server who was super casual. Don't get me wrong, I don't need pomp and circumstance, but when the kid at In N Out is more professional, then Houston we got a problem.\n\nSecondly for some crazy reason, the booth behind ours had about 25 outdoor seat cushions stacked up. I know they are for outside, and need to go somewhere, but this is Saturday night at 7. Put them AWAY. They spent thousands of dollars on ambiance, only to ruin it with a stack of cushions? Weird.\n\nOk KEG, those are some issues that need work. The food was good as usual, but it's not enough to carry a sketchy service otherwise. Ironically we chose KEG over Durant's which in retrospect- was a grave error.
