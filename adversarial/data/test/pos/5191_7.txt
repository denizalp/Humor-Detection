Ah Marcs, what can I say......the disorganization, the old ladies giving me the evil eye when I try to go around them as they ponder the many jars of pickled relishes with there cart at a 45 degree angle to the shelves.....\n\nThe newly opened Marcs at Kamms Plaza was a bit of a shock -when I first saw it..... it was the nicest Marcs I had ever seen.  They have GD chandeliers in this joint...anyway went over to get two things -  corned-beef and cabbage - walked out with Crystal Light, apples, stuff to make Chilli, a BPA free water bottle, and two window planters.... \n\nThis Marcs is hands down the best Marcs around that I have seen.  Very clean, and they have a deli.  They also have continued to carry Corbo's bakery items (i.e. cakes, pizza dough)\nI have been checking prices with ShopSavvy app and have found that most prices are equal or less than most.\n\nYep nice Marcs...
