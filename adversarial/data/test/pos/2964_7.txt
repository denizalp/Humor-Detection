My visit to Dr Monroe was the worst experience I've had in a doctors office in years!  I had an appointment and waited for an hour while the rude receptionist seemed irritated that I was asking her questions while she sent text messages on her phone at the front desk. I said something to the office manager and she was less than helpful and also seemed irritated that I would say something. I asked the Doc to call me because i was having some unexpected side effects from the meds she gave me, and did not hear back. My next appointment, I got my dates confused and was automatically added to the walk-in list without being told, even though I  pointedly stated that I thought I had a 10am visit scheduled.  So 45 minutes later I was really getting steamed. I requested the doctor call me with test results if possible, and again, never heard back - this time in over 3 weeks!  I  wrote a letter to the doctor herself, and no one bothered to call or contact me in any way. And worst of all, she prescribed the right meds, but in the wrong amount and made my symptoms worse!!!! She dresses too racy in short skirts and 4 inch heals and I would not EVER go back, and I strongly recommend that you don't either. I used Yelp to find a great new OBGYN at New Beginnings, and she is so good, I will gladly drive out of my way to see her!!!
