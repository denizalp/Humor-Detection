This place deserves zero stars. As a previous  employee of Henderson  petland, I can honestly  tell you that this place is a complete scam. To start off, the workers are absolutely  fake to customers . They all lie and make stuff up and do whatever they  can to sell a dog. (There is a sales goal daily, like most jobs have...) most importantly , are the poor animals.... they are treated  horribly when customers  aren't able to see, such as the cages in the back and when being groomed. I was absolutely  shocked when I saw how the other workers were treating the dogs,and not giving them proper care what so ever.... the store is completely  unsanitary , and disgusting . .. the animals are very over priced,extremely  under cared for,and come from puppy mills... do not buy a dog from here!!!! During  my employment  at this crap hole, I had several customers coming back to the store, with the dog that they have just purchased  within a few weeks or so, complaining  they it was very sick and had health issues,when the worker selling  the dog,swore up and down that the dog was perfectly  healthy and fine.  The other employees at the time, were told to make stuff up and lie just to get the dog sold, by the manager david bravo,as i had mentioned earlier....This joint needs to be permanently  shut down,and all of those precious  animals need to go to a better place so they are able to find forever ,loving  homes.
