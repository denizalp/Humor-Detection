I had a gift card for Cane's and I stopped here last weekend.  The place wasn't too busy.  We found a seat and I ordered 3 piece combos for the two of us.\n\nThe food was ready quickly and I waited at the counter rather than have the kid bring the plastic trays to the table.  During this time, I got the two iced teas we would have.\n\nThe food was very hot and it was good.  I'd been to Raining Cane's before and I knew what to expect.  I got a refill of my iced tea before we left.\n\nMy only complaint was they level of air conditioning.  Damn it was cold in there.  \n\nCane's is a now and then kind of thing.  A drawback is it's very family friendly and the sometimes loud, howling youngsters detract from the meal.
