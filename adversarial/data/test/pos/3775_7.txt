A crafters and creator's mecca, it is truly as good as it gets.\n\nThis is a destination in Northern Phoenix for date nights, mommy daughter dates, birthday parties, and more festivities.\n\nOptions are endless here.  Crafts and projects here change regularly, in keeping with current trends and seasons. Do anything from creating your own \"Jackson Pollock\" on the splatter wall, to creating your own Fairy House, or personalized menu board for your kitchen. Check the project menu for their ever changing menu of crafts projects. For the coming Fall season, you can make items such as burlap and tie ribbon wreaths, mason jar leaf candle holders, or your very own bulletin board with pennant. \n\nThe kid's parties are amazing, as they have an entire room to themselves where they can create canvas paintings, splatter wall paintings, enjoy s'mores, cut, color, paste, and glitter. All in a whimsical setting that invites free play of imagination and child.\n\nParents can enjoy themselves in the main hall where bubbles, beer and wine are served at the bar.  \n\nLocal handmade goods and DIY kits are available here, so it is also a great spot for purchasing unique gifts.  \n\nThe images do it the justice, that my words cannot.\n\nI can't wait to take my husband, and my daughters, here on a date night!
