For a store that's right in the center of Oakland, it's not very student friendly. They treated me like a criminal when I first walked in. They will strip you of your properties...like bookbags and purses. I guess I understand the paranoia since they are located in the middle of a college area where alcohol is like gold...but at least place my belongings in safe place, instead of just throwing it on the counter where some sketchy character could just swing by and then straight for the exit. \n\nThey have a good selection of wine and spirits with all the sections nicely marked, which makes looking for stuff so much quicker. Well, I kind of have to be quick to make sure nobody steals my stuff. The prices are decent and occasionally they'll have sales so you'll be able to save a few bucks. \n\nDue to the rude service and tense atmosphere, it was such an uncomfortable experience. Overall, I'm glad there's a Wine and Spirits in Oakland...it fulfills it's true purpose I guess. \n\nStay classy Pitt!
