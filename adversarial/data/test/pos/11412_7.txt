This review is for my visit on July 12th 2014 to celebrate my wedding anniversary.  \n\nService: \nthe service overall was good but nothing special.  I would expect top notch service at a 3 star Michelin restaurant at this caliber.  however, I do have a complaint, the restaurant should offer dark linen for guests wearing dark clothing and white linen for guests wearing lighter color clothing.  I've seen this done at some of the restaurants in LA and I really appreciated the attention to detail down to the color of the linen.  I definitely don't want to get white lint stuck on my black dress or suit.  Secondly, the waiter's and waitress's attire is a little outdated ( especially the waiter's suits don't seem to fit very well and are very old fashion).  Although what they wear really has nothing to do with my meal or the service that I receive, I just think their outfit needs to match the whole posh\/chic\/upscale atmosphere. Finally, because we were there for our anniversary , my husband had ordered a special celebratory cake for us to share.  The waiter brought the cake out on a nicely decorated tray with a pretty sugar piece and a sign that says \" happy anniversary.\"   the issue here is that he brought it out and left so quickly I didn't even get a chance to take a pic of it.  He quickly showed it to me, then turned it over to show it to my husband and that was that.  Didn't offer to wait for me to take a picture of the whole tray.  The whole experience with the tray felt very very rushed.  We each got a slice of the cake and in my mind, I thought I get to take the rest of the cake home.  but I guess not, cuz they didn't pack the rest for us.\n\nFood:\nThe food was Ok.  I've had better.  Like the previous reviewer had stated, if you're in LA, you'll probably enjoy Melisse more.  We ended up spending more than we should have.  I was not impressed with the food.  we had the 5 course tasting menu but we get to try more than 5 courses because my husband and I chose different things on the menu ( you get to choose 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert from a list).  so in actuality, I get to try 10 different items that night, and NONE impressed me.  I  thought the food was either too salty or too bland.  Most of the dishes had similar jelly type of consistency.  even the soup had a weird thick consistency that I don't care for.  everyone on here complimented on the bread cart.  but I don't think it's worth it to spend a sh'tload of money just to chow down on the breads.  there were 8 choices of bread to choose from.  I tasted every one of them based on the views on here but I find them nothing special.  you can get really good bread elsewhere and pay a fraction of the price.  They also have a mini dessert cart to end your meal.  Ok, anyone that knows me , know that I have a sweet tooth and I know my desserts...BUT the dessert cart had nothing that I really like.  the macarons were just OK ( Lette's or Bottega Louie is WAY better).  mini operas and cupcakes were BLEH...gosh it was the most pathetic dessert cart I've ever seen in my entire career of eating sweets.\n\nLast words:\n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY.  if you're in LA, try Melisse or Providence.  Both are really really good and local! I think they should downgrade this restaurant to a 1 star or a no star restaurant.
