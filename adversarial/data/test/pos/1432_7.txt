Styles by Shawn what can I say? Hmmmmmm..... Well don't go there if your white. I walked in the door and FOUR \"Stylist\" refused to give me a haircut. I was discriminated against and there most likely will be a lawsuit to come. Shawn was the only one who did offer to cut my hair when he was finished with his current customer which was very nice of him. I would suggest he get rid of the rest of the racist pieces of sh** he has working there. They unfortunately have involved him in a discrimination lawsuit which is too bad because he seemed like a nice guy.
