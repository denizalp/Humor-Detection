********** Last night was the \"Last Chopstick\" for us *********** \n \nI'm well aware that some Folks love \"George's Visits\" to their table.\nThe food here is \"Hit or Miss.\"\n               ....... and when they Miss ......... its beyond belief.\n                      Finally my Wife said ........ NEVER AGAIN.\n\nLast nights experience, finally brought her around to agreeing with what .....  I've been  telling her for years.  \n\n                            Confucius and Marvin say ........ Don't waste your Yuan here.
