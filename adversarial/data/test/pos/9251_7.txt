If I could give a negative star rating I would! \nLet me start from the beginning. We asked what the shacksause was and the worker couldn't even tell us what it was, what it was similar to or what was in it. \n\nWe then took the lid off of our $5.29 shake and it wasn't even filled all the way. When I went up to question why my shake wasn't filled all the way the worker replied that they don't fill them all the way!\n\nNext was the burger, while it did taste good it wasn't so good that I would pay $5.29 ever again for JUST a burger. I could go to a countless number of other places where I could pay just about the same amount and get just as good of a burger and get fries and a drink with it. \n\nAnd then we come to the fries. Again they tasted fine but were a little over cooked for my liking. \nNeedless to say we will NEVER be coming back here again. \n\n2 burgers, a shake, fry and a soda for $23 no thank you. I came hungry and am now leaving hungry. We will be returning to our usual cheaper prices and good tasting burger places.
