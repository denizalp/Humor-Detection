It is my first & last stop here ! They are horrible ! I ordered fry fish & Chopped steak, which should come with mushroom & steamed veggies ..... Yes, chopped steak they brought it was humbugger patty with horrible mushroom gravy and canned carrots ..... all food love for 10.95..... Really???? Humbugger patty... I said thanks, it is not what I ordered @ what written on menu ... Waitress charged me 50% of my plate , which she took back!!!!!! Wow! Fish was sooooo greasy & French frys sooooo dark which swimmed in old oil !!!!! OMG !!!! I had to actually fight & tell them to fix a bill. Will I be back there??????? Yeah, no guesses!!!! Hell nooooooo
