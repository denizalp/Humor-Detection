3.5 STARS: GOOD \n\n  Straight from the heart, I am writing that it is wonderful to live in a metropolitan area that is a melting pot of food from throughout the world. Yesterday, I was in the mood for some out of this world philly cheesesteak. So, I motored on down to Straight From Philly. \n\n   If it weren't for Yelp and the Internet, it would be a challenge to find Straight from Philly. There is a want of signing to advertise the small family-owned shop in the half-abandoned Stephanie Promenade Shopping Center at the northwest corner of Stephanie and American -Pacific. Along the shopping center, it is difficult to spot. \n\n  Where there is a want of advertising the restaurant, there is no shortage of good customer service. On my second visit here, the owner and an employee were friendly and prepared a delicious sandwich. Straight from Philly is a mom and pop shop. Your money goes to a small business that is actually becoming a bigger business. Recently Straight from Philly opened another location off of Lake Mead Parkway and Water Street at the Gateway to downtown Henderson. \n\n  On my first visit, I ordered a hoagie special. A few months ago in January, Straight from Philly featured a different lunch special for each day of the week excluding Sunday when they were closed. I remember the roast beef hoagie with fries that I ate on January 7 as being delicious. Fast forward to halfway into the year, and Straight from Philly offers a few daily specials from 11 to 4 with the $10.15 philly cheesesteak  with fries and Coke fountain drink for $10.15 plus tax all day long.\n\n  The cheesesteak special was delicious. Ditto for the fries. Reviewing a restaurant that celebrates Philly cheesesteaks from the City of Brotherly Love, I have to write with some tough yelp love that Straight from Philly needs to include cheese and toppings with the  special. Honestly, isn't there supposed to be cheese on a cheesesteak? Regardless that the delicious sandwich was loaded with quality meat in a tasty bun with onions and prepared by the owner was GOOD; melted cheese with mushrooms would WOW me to the degree that I would become a regular and up my rating, which is a reflection of my opinion to four stars: I am a fan.\n\n8\/22\/2015 UPDATE: No more daily specials and complimentary ice cream.
