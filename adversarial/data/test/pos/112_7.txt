I hate to say it, but I am going to join the dissenting minority. This ice cream is not great.\n\nI ordered a junior dark chocolate ice cream dish ($3.21 w tax), which is a single scoop. Floats were $7-$9, and I think waffle cones were $6, which is WAY more than Dave and Andy's. I get that rent on South Highland is probably terrible but wow. And unfortunately, the ice cream quality was more than not great.  My single scoop had so much sugar that you could see it. I was so sick of the scoop halfway through because it just tasted like pure sugar.  The consistency is also very icy and not creamy, which is not my thing.\n\nThe store is cute, the menu is simple, and the staff is nice.  There is both outdoor and indoor seating, and the interior is clean.\n\nThe waffle cones looked really good, but at this price and quality, I will stick to Dave and Andy's.
