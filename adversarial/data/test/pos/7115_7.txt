i ride my bike through trinity every day on my way to work. despite the doom & gloom feeling I get about going to work, i can't help having a goofy grin  while whizzing through the park past the elderly people doing tai chi, all the dogwalkers and exercise buffs.\ni had my 30th birthday here and it goes down as my favourite birthday ever. on an illegal note, you can get away with drinking your beer in a bag without getting busted if you go down in the valley and usually there's an old asian woman there waiting to collect your empties!\ni'm glad this place has remained unscathed by the city strike. it's still clean and i don't know who is taking care of putting in garbage bags in the bins but keep up the job!
