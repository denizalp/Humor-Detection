For me it's the simple things.  The simple things done very well.  And employees who actually, genuinely seem happy to see customers.  Imagine that.  (Take note Sprouts employees...you grouchy fockers).  \n\nI was the only person in the joint today around 11:30 and got myself a ground beef taco, a Coke, and a cinnamon and sugar fry bread for dessert.  I LOVED that the young man working the register asked me if I'd like to get the cinn & sug fry bread a little later.  Why yes I would!  For 2 reasons.  If you give it to me with my taco, I will eat all of it first and the taco will get cold.  Second, I made myself eat about a third of the taco, enjoying every bite, and saving room for my dessert, which was warm and cinnamoney and sugary and delicious!  \n\nDelicious is the word of the day for this place.  I enjoyed every aspect of my meal, and I was glad to see the place start to fill up as I was leaving.  I will try to be more adventurous next time and get something with stronger flavors, but I LOVE simple beef tacos.  For me they are comfort food, and this was a great one.  Go check them out if you haven't!
