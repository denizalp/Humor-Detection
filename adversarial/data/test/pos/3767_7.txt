Dr. Lane Smith is the most unprofessional, egotistical piece of work I have ever met!!! DO NOT go to him. I had 3 procedures done with him at the same time, He ruined my life, and my nose. All i wanted was the tip of my nose to be lifted and now my whole nose is shifted to one side and i have a bone that sticks out on one side. He also gave me a botched boob job!! When i went in to speak with him about it, he got all defensive and started yelling at me telling me I had body dis morphia. It was visible to all my friends and family and he refused to take responsibility and to fix his mistake. His receptionist \/ esthetician was so rude and should be working at a farm!!! Treating people like animals. You might find the odd few that liked his work, but those are the lucky ones. Few people I know have went to him and they had to go back time after time to have him fix his mistake and they were not happy with the results even after the second time!! If you are looking for a good doctor Lane Smith is not your answer, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!
