Smokey. Very Smokey. \nExpensive. \n\nNice property. \nTight video poker and domestic beers are $6.50. \nNo comps at Tribal casinos in AZ. You pay while you play.\nEverything is extra cost, everything including using the pool.\n\nNice looking, friendly 30 to 40 year old hookers. Didn't price nor use them but the tell is they'll approach you asking a favor.\n\nBuffet hours can change. Now breakfast ends at 9:30 am lunch starts at 10:30 am dinner hours vary.\nGood buffet and the other restaurants are first rate too.
