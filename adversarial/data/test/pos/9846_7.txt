Disclaimer:  I did not really do any research on beer here as I do not really drink beer ;) I do like watching my friends enjoy beer while I imbibe something else when hanging out, though, and that is exactly what I did here.  I met up with one of my  friends here on my recent trip to AZ for a second lunch ;) after meeting with another group of friends down the street for brunch.  Hence, I wasn't super hungry, but I wanted to catch up with my friend here and ordered the tasty SW Poutine. This was a very hearty version of the french fry dish topped with beef gravy, machaca, queso and pico de gallo. This can easily be shared with several people.  It is probably the richest poutine I have ever had, but was really tasty stuff!  I had a Pinot Gris from Oregon in a can. Yes, hipster wine, and it was refreshingly good. My friend ordered lunch of grilled wings and mac and cheese which he enjoyed as well as the craft beer he drank. \n\nOur friendly server told us that the craft beers rotate so often that he was printing up a brand new list which he handed to us fresh off the printer ;)   Besides craft beer and cider, wine and cocktails, as well as non-alcoholic beverages are on the drink menu.  The American cuisine food menu has appetizers, soup and salads, burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  I liked the atmosphere of Beer Research Institute.  It is a casual, friendly, pub-like kinda place with bar area, communal tables and booths for seating. A great place for hanging out with my friend.  Our server checked on us often, was attentive, helpful and charming. \n\nBRI is a fun place to hang out with friends.  I will definitely come back here next time around with a bigger appetite so I can try some more things off of their menu and check out some of the ciders they have.
