Kim's QATTPR (Quick And To The Point Review).\n\nIN THE FORM OF GREATNESS\nChicken Noodle Rica could possibly be the best dish on planet earth.  This magnificent noodle bowl come with steamed napa cabbage, bok choy, pea pods, carrots, water chestnuts, green onions and sesame seeds.  Basically everything you need in life is incorporated in this dish well except red wine or liquor however, we are talking lunch time here so with that being said this is a winner winner chicken.... lunch!\n\nMIXED FEELINGS\nThe Coco-Ginger sauce is a bit weak however, a quick two step to the condiment stand will solve this problem.  Why yes for here it sits the heavenly Sriracha Hot Sauce, pick that bad boy up and add a few thousand squeezes to your coco-ginger sauce and you've got yourself an exquisite sauce fit for a Thai King. \n\nBAD TO THE BONE\nLimited seating is a bummer given the fabulous music piped through this joint.  Long lines during prime time lunch hours is a bit of an upset however, I personally would wait two years in the Sahara Desert without water or sunscreen to enjoy just one small fork full of this insanely delicious chow.\n\npeace, blessing, salad dressing\n\nThe Kim
