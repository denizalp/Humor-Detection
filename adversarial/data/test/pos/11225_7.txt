Such a clean, friendly and pleasant atmosphere to enjoy all their signature craft beers and quite a few rare ones from other breweries as well.  \n\nAwesome promotions include their happy hours which give you $1 off your beer and my favorite Pint Tuesdays.  You purchase a Tenaya Creek glass for $6 it comes filled with 1 of their 8 rotating beers and from that point on hold into your glass because refills the rest of the night and for every Tuesday thereafter it is $3 to refill it.  \n\n There isn't a kitchen on property and on occasion they will have a food truck outside but my tip would be to arrive with a full stomach since those beers can hit heavy on an empty stomach. Can always pick up a light meal or snack off the truck if needed :)\n\nAll in all a fantastic venue with games, inside and outside seating and the main reason of course delicious beer. \n\nCheers
