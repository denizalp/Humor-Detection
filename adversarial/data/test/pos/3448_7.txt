I'll state that I've visited this store more than I'd like to admit.  A purse just needs to jump out at me for me to buy it.   Well that day finally happened where I didn't want to leave without the perfect purse.  I love the quality and texture of my MK bag.  \n\nMy gripe would be about he helicopter sales people.  Sure...  I appreciate the help when I need it.  But I usually can't take two steps without being hovered over.  Since the store isn't that huge, they would notice the other salesmen offering assistance and back off.  \n\nThe store itself if very clean and bright.   It's situated nicely next to the Coach store.  Can't find something in one store... just walk to the next.   \n\nPurse shopping is just one of my addictions.   This girl just can't have enough bags!
