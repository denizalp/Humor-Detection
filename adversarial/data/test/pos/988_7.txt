A great bar\/restaurant specializing in all types of imported beer. Their draught and bottle list is quite extensive with lots of hard to find beer. If you can't decide on a specific beer or feel like being experimental, they also have sample sizes ($6 for 3 samples).\n\nAs a group we tasted 7 different beers...everything ranging from a super smoky German beer (with a campfire like aroma!), wheat beers, various ales and everything was super tasty. Sadly we didn't try any of the food, though it looks wonderful and everything comes with a beer suggestion.\n\nWe came here around 9pm and it was very clear this is definitely an after work style hangout. Most people here are dressed in suits and trying to relax...no dress code is enforced, but you'll look out of place going completely casual.\n\nEnjoy!
