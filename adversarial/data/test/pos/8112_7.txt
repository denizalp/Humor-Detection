Clearly still bitter about the nearby 3,250,000 cubic yards of concrete being named after Herby Hoover, the Boulder Dam Brewing Company chose to honor the Dam's original name. Perhaps because of the depression or maybe because he had pet alligators, there will never be a Hoover Dam Brewing Company.  \n\nHoover is missing out because the beer here is very good and is only $3 a pint during happy hour.  I would say crafting a beer of this quality and selling it at such low prices is a greater engineering achievement than building a giant wall to make a river flood, and I know what I'm talking about.
