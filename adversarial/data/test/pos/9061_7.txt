Well after a year of boy clotting the gym I have been going to this location everyday for the past 3 weeks.  The staff is very friendly and the personal trainers have no problem to stop and show you something if you ask.  It is extremely clean in this gym.  Not a big fan how the TV's are on Sports, news and the goodlife channel as this is all boring to watch while working out.  I have been going to this gym 6:00 every morning but I have noticed the gym is fairly busy and over packed after 3:00 until 7:00.  My review went from a 1 star to a four and I truly believe they deserve this.  By the way the only have one tanning room here that's a stand up so don't bother coming here to tan.
