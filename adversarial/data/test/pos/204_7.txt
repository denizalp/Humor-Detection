Tried out this new location today for lunch. I ordered the Spicy Jalape√±o Extra Chicken ramen and my brother had the Extra Pork Shoyu ramen. Both soup bases were weak and not as good as their downtown locations. They also play their music playing too loud. They should know it's a problem when their waiters can't even hear their customer's order.
