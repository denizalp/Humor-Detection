Dormont Lanes is inconspicuously located in the basement of a Dormont plaza on West Liberty Avenue, somewhere between Wine & Spirits and CVS \/ Payless. I am no bowler, but this is a smaller alley with a huge upside to it: BYOB. The last time I went with friends we brought a 30 pack and pizza on the off chance that they'd let us, and the guy there didn't bat an eye! Now I am no big fan of bowling, but I am a big fan of beer, and the more beer I drink the more I'm a fan of bowling. And by proxy I am a fan of Dormont Lanes! Good times had by all
