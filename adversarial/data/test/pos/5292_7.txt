Last night I slept soundly at the Waterside Inn. The three glasses of sauv blanc I had across the street likely helped knock me out, but the shmooshy mattress on the four post bed surely didn't hurt my sleepy cause. \n\nThe staff here are very sweet, save some overly eager maids. The rooms themselves are massive, essentially short term apartments. Hideously decorated, but really large. You win some, you lose some. If I needed to house myself in Port Credit I would certainly return to the Waterside. \n\nAlas, I have to cap this place at three stars, because I fear they are trying to trick people visiting Toronto to stay in Port Credit, and it's just too far of a drive. This is significantly farther than their advertised 20 minutes. But if this cute area of the 'Saug is where you are planning on spending most of your time, this is a great option. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For every room having a balcony. Fresh air is a refreshing change. \n\nPEPPER POSES: How in the world does a washer and dryer in one work? That machine in the kitchen of this room was cray.
