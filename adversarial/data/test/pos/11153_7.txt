The team at RideNow in Peoria are awesome! When they work on your ride, it's like theyre working on their own. They take great pride in their work, and they take great care of their customers. From sales to service, there is a consistency in the treatment of their customers. When I was ready for my second bike, there was no hesitation. My first thought was RideNow in Peoria. I knew they would treat me like a valued customer, and it would not be until the end of the sale, but afterwards as well. When I had an issue with my bike, they picked it up FROM MY HOUSE on a trailer, and made sure the issue was resolved. How much did it cost me! ZERO. I'll never shop anywhere else.
