Chilly Jilly'z was just what the doctor ordered after a 6 mile hike in neighboring Arizona. Chilly Jilly'z was made even more enticing since it's equipped with a drive-thru - we were too exhausted to contemplate standing up and getting out of the car. I ordered a dole-whip float sans the whipped cream and my better half got a raspberry smoothie. \n\nThe dole whip float was great and I loved the pink umbrella it came with. Next time I'll probably just get a regular ol' dole whip though. My husband's raspberry smoothie tasted healthy (maybe too healthy). Our final verdict: we'll be back, especially after a long hike.\n\nYELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #4
