There are not many places close by where you can purchase craft beers to take home. This spot has a nice little selection. It's no Bevmo but they manage to pack in everything you need plus some when it come to your craft brew cravings. They also cater to the home brewers. They have everything you need to brew your own craft beer at home and we found out that they are opening up a tap room next door. I find that super exciting!
