They might as well close this place up. The selection stinks, the staff doesn't know what the hell they have or how anything works. I'm not sure how they've even stayed in business. \n\nI'm normally not a big fan of this chain, but holy crap - they had nothing. Not even remotes for presentations let alone anything else I needed. \n\nVery disappointed in this place!
