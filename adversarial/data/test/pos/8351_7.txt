With my recent move came a change of healthclub\/gym locations too...\n\nIt was hard to say goodbye to my friends at the Camelback location of the Village, but DC Ranch is an amazing facility.  Top notch equipment, classes, cafe, boutique, pool, and more... I especially like taking spin classes here - Brian, Michelle, Mimi, and Amanda are all standout instructors.  \n\nIt's kind of like an escape from reality to get into your workout zone at the DC Ranch village.  It's a 5 star facility no doubt, but you do pay for it!  If anyone reading this review ever wants to buy me a present, I'll gladly accept spa services from the Village - it's spectacular!  (Well, I've only had waxing and massage, but both are phenomenal).  Can you tell that I'm in love with the Village?
