Definitely wouldn't recommend coming here. Lines are always long and slow.. People like to linger around the entrance and try to ask for change or cat call and say weird creepy comments (which is super creepy at night being a girl by myself). Also, the store doesn't keep up with all of their expiration dates of their items.. There was a time I was gonna buy coffee creamer and like 10 of them were over a month expired WHAT THE?Â¿? Crazy. So definitely look at the expiration dates before you actually make your purchase. The only reason why I keep coming here is because it's right next to my apartment. Now I always go with my boyfriend and we forsure always double check everything before we buy things.
