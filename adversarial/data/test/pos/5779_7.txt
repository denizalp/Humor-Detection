Today, 2:35PM.\nMe; standing in line ready to pay.  4 other people on line.\nCashiers:  Folding tee shirts and stacking them while we waited on line.  AND waited and waited.  \nMe:  Wondering when it would dawn on the cashiers to attend to customers ready to spend US currency in this bad economy.  \nAssessment:  These two guy cashiers have NO DAMN brains & management has fewer neurons for allowing this to take place.
