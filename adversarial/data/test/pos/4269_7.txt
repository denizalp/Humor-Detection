I have lived here for almost 2 years and the apartment complex is wonderful. The front office is kind and will work with you on any financial problems. The foliage is great and it does not seem we are in Phoenix but out in the midwest or back East. The only negative things is there are so many stray cats and their waste and urine are everywhere and it does not seem that the owner takes this disgusting problem seriously. I love this apartment complex,  I use to love cats although this complex has turned me into a dog lover.
