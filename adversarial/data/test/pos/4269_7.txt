God damn!  I never seen so many TSA people strapped with latex gloves and bitchie looking Homeland Security people checking everyone's boarding passes and ID's.  I guess they just keep getting stricter and stricter at the airports.\n\nDamn them for getting me to lose $30 on the slot machines over here while waiting for our flight back to San Jose too.\n\nI bet if they had tables here, a shitload of people would be missing their flights and it'd be impossible to get a stand-by flight if you're late to your terminal check-in.
