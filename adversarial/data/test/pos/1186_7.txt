Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #137 - #365\n\nOh how I heart the Luxor, especially the powerful beam at night. Quarky Vegas still lives! It's south strip location isn't convenient towards the center strip, so you'd either have to walk a long distance or take a cab. The sphinx is one of the only marks on Luxor that keep it Egyptian other than the pyramid.\n\nCheck In was quick and the clerk was very friendly. Our room was in the prymaid so we had to walk a long ways towards the corner of the prymaid to get to the inclinator (elevator). Walking to the room was fun just looking at what was left of the Egyptian theme and the inclinator was shakey! We were on the 23rd floor and had a view of the atrium. Breathtaking view of the atrium and where you can people watch 24\/7. \n\nThe room was just bland. More like a notch above Excalibur and on the same league as Ballys and the Flamingo. There was no wifi so I had to use my AT&T network but I heard they plan on adding WiFi soon. Welcome to the 2,000's!  \n\nPool here is not luxurious and just as average as the hotel room. Food options are ok with the food court and average buffet with no wow factor. It's also connected internally to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. If you're too tired to walk, they have a monorail that connects to all three resorts. \n\nWhat I'll miss most about the Luxor is the spitting camels and the water ride. The positives are the Carrot Top, Bodies Exhibit, and the Titanic Exhibit.
