The place is very nice .. the view to the lake is fantastic. ..great selection of wines ..\n\nBut....\nThe food  is horrible !!! ...\nThe ugliest French onion soup I ever try !!!\nI also order the Quiche .. no flavor ..taste like a terrible omelet ..  \n\nThere's nothing special in the menu !! \nPoor quality .. \nYou guy's need to hire a real chef !!!! \nAnd service ..is really bad !!! \nI Asked for napkins and lemons .. totally ignored \nServer never came to check ..
