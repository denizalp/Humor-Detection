Okay, if you know me, you already know I'll pretty much do anything for chocolate... This place?  Good grief.  The combinations they have, the absolutely gorgeous presentation, the friendly staff?  I really don't know how it can get better...\n\nHave you ever seen something so pretty you literally don't want to eat it?  That's everything on the menu here... The flavors?   Dude.  The flavors.  I had a Rosemary Lemon Caramel bon-bon... It looked like glass... Seriously, it looked like a beautifully stained pane of glass in a window somewhere... It actually glistened and reflected in the light...  It reminded me of a leaf in the middle of a color change...  I loved the vibrant green!  And the taste?  It was a sublime melding of flavors... You could taste the rosemary, but it didn't overpower the lemon, caramel or chocolate...  I could barely believe how scrumptious it was...  They also give you a little treat in addition to whatever you purchase... Tonight it was a piece of milk chocolate bark that tasted like it had a toffee, pistachio and some other nut topping sprinkled on it... Perfection.\n\nThey're a little pricey at $2.50 a pop, but given the quality?  Consider it a culinary investment... That's why I'm heading back tomorrow to get a Coriander Pop Rocks Praline treat... Yep...  You read that right...  Coriander Pop Rocks Praline.  I cannot wait!
