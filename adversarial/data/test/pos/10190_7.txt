I would give this place 0 stars if I could. My husband is gluten and dairy intolerant and can not eat these items without getting violently ill. He even throws up blood from time to time due to the severity of his sensitivity. I wanted to treat him to a nice lunch and got very excited when I saw that this place was advertised as gluten free and vegan. Upon ordering we were informed that the pizza was cooked in an oven with other items but that it was still gluten free so we proceeded with the order. The waitress then informed us that the pizza was very small and we would want to add something else to our order. I asked which items were gluten free and she informed me that the wings were gluten free. Upon receiving the appetizer we were told they were cooked in the same fryer and were not in fact gluten free after we had started eating. After leaving my husband got violently ill and called to complain. We were informed that it was our fault for ordering the items because of cross contamination that we should have been knowledgable of. \nWe only went to this place because it was advertised as gluten free. We would not have ordered if we knew that NONE OF THEIR ITEMS ARE ACTUALLY GLUTEN FREE\nThe customer service after this mistake was just added insult. The manager was unapologetic and uncaring of our situation. He claimed that they ask about celiacs disease and give warnings about cross contamination which was not even slightly hinted at. He also said that there was a miscommunication when in fact we were blatantly lied to. We specifically asked questions regarding my husbands allergies and were instructed to purchase items that conflicted with these allergies. If you advertise that items are gluten free they need to actually be gluten free. \nYOU WOULD NEVER SERVE SOMEONE WITH A SEVERE NUT ALLERGY A DISH CONTAMINATED WITH NUTS
