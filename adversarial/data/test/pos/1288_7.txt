I love Gymboree and must admit that most of the purchases are more for my own personal pleasure than they are for my daughter. She's 14 months, she's happy to run around in a diaper. However, she has a closet full of Gymboree outfits from both outlet and retail lines. The good thing about Gymbo is that it retains value and there are some really fanatic moms like myself who collect certain sets. I have sold some of the outfits my daughter outgrew and promptly reinvested it in new season sets.\n\nThat being said, this store is great. The selection is solid with a number of lines available at any given time along with a vast selection of sizes. There are always sales happening, and if there are no sales, Gymbo usually sends decent coupons for their members. The staff is upbeat and seems to really love what they do. They have helped me complete number of outfits and I must say are great at up selling (not that I minded). Although it may seem pricey for just children's clothing, it is great quality, fun clothing that keep their value. They also offer GymBucks that provide additional savings and make the prices comparable to Target or Baby Gap.
