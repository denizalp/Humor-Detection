To be honest, of all the bike shops in the city these guys had by far the best prices with the most variety... so why the shitty rating? The owner has an attitude problem.\n\nI was walking by with my boyfriend and decided to ask about their repair costs. I told the guy at the register who also happened to be the owner that my back tire wasn't rotating properly and I wanted a ballpark of how much it would cost to take a look at it. He pretty much said \"I don't know.\" Now I did mention to him that this was my first time having a bike fixed and I was unfamiliar with the typical cost structure.. I was just looking for an idea of price, is it gonna be a quick $20 or more like $200? He was than quite condescending with me when I implied that I was aware of what caused my bike wheel to bust and asked if that information would help. \"Sure you know what's wrong with it\" (he said in a creepy baby voice) \"Why don't you tell me what YOU think is wrong with it and I'll let you know if that's a possibility\". I made the decision at that moment that there was no way this asshole was going to touch my bike!\n\nWhile my bf was looking at a super nice black Electra with an eight-ball painted on the side, I mentioned to him that a matching helmet might be cute with it. The owner chuckled overhearing my comment and said that \"good bike drives don't need helmets... if you know what you're doing that is.\" That is maybe the dumbest most irresponsible thing I have ever heard someone say, especially since he sells bikes. That's like not wearing a seat belt on the grounds of being a good driver. It's irrelevant! Come to think of it I don't recall seeing helmets for sale there at all... which is kind of disturbing if you ask me.
