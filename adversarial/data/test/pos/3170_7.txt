It had been a lot of years and I was thinking, you know, some questionable cow and fake horseradish sauce might just hit the spot.\n\nTheir signature roast beef sandwitch comes in 3 sizes: small, medium, and something approaching the size of your head. \n\nI think my meal had enough salt in it to pay a Roman legion with, but since the legions today are paid in Federal Reserve fiat greenbacks, the salt goes to Arby's. Maybe I'll try it again after I time travel into the future a few years.
