Review in Haiku form:\n\nWe owe you a debt\nChef Emeril Lagasse,\nWell designed sports book.\n\nAnd maybe a second haiku because it's so special:\n\nFood, drinks, and gamblin' ?\nEmeril, your menu rocks!\nDon't lose, Patriots!\n\nSeriously though, it's gorgeous, easily the nicest I've seen in Vegas, or anywhere.
