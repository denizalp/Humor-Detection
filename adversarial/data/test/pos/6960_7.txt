The hands-down greatest rock band of all time combined with Cirque? Are you kidding me?? I was so excited to see this show I almost peed my pants. My gf got us tix to see it for Valentines Day (I know, awww) and the first 20 minutes of the show was all I expected and more. Dreamy sequences with hints of characters from the songs I grew up listening to..it was amazing. I sung along with every track and darted my eyes around the stage so I wouldn't miss anything. I bought the soundtrack before seeing the show so I sort of knew what to expect music wise (awesome soundtrack btw; remixing the Beatles is like sacrilege but not in this case).\n\nThe only problem was that 20 minutes in, some jackass pulled the fire alarm...and the show grinded...to....a.....halt. The fire sprinklers over one of the sections starting going off, so they had to evacuate everyone. Unfortunately we never got to see the rest of the show, but we got a refund and were comped a meal and VIP seating after I called and bitched. Those 20 minutes sure were spectacular though.\n\n*** Update 12\/18\/07: We finally made it back to see this show again. The whole time we were praying another fire alarm wouldn't go off, and we actually made it thru the whole show! LOVEd it, wouldn't change a thing. Not as acrobatic as the other Cirque shows from what I've heard, but the visuals combined with the timeless tracks is pure gold. Big ups to whoever did the motion graphics on the screens as well.
