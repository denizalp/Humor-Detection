Carbone is located in the lovely Aria.  You can find it on the second level across from Bardot. Even during the week I would recommend making reservations as it was pretty busy during our dining experience.\n\nSince our friends made the reservations, we were seated without hesitation.  Our main waiter for the evening was very courteous and professional.  His counterpart, who assisted table duties, was a little off color for this dining establishment.  It almost became comical by the end of the night to see what he would say next. \n\nA lovely variety of bread, fresh parmesan, italian meat and cauliflower are all brought to each table compliments of the restaurant.  It was actually surprising how much is bought out before placing any food orders. With all of these goodies I decided to skip the salad and order the Veal Parmesan.  This entree is huge with plenty to take home for leftovers.  The sauce could have used a bit more flavor to brighten the dish.  The veal was good but not the best of quality I was expecting.  \n\nSince I was dining with the dessert queen, we decided to split the NY Cheesecake.  It was very creamy with a hint of lemon to create a delicious flavor.  I would absolutely order this again.  The complimentary tricolored cakes brought out were pretty but dry.  I did however appreciate all of the generosity.\n\nBut they just keep on giving... a complimentary bottle of limoncello is also presented to the table.  Now since I was driving I decided to pass.  From our friends at the table it was pretty strong so drink slowly!\n\nI enjoyed my evening here but I hope the quality improves.
