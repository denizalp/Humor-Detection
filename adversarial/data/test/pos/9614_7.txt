One star because we got kicked out!  \"You are banging on the machine get out GO!\"  We came in on a Wednesday evening with our quarters and started playing some of the pinball machines.  This place has a good concept and there are a lot of pinball machines that people can play.  After about 20 minutes the owner came up to us and kicked us out of the place.   I believe he thinks his place is a museum.  If that is the case, treat it like one and don't offer people to play on the machines.  From reading the other reviews we are not the first ones to get kicked out.
