This park has a little something for everyone - from ball fields to kayaking to a place for lunch, people of all ages and abilities will be pleased. There's even a dog park for your furry friends. The lake is the true gem of the park, providing both beautiful views and various areas for exercise or play (bday parties and the like.) \n\nIf you're in or near Allison Park, it's worth a visit - if you're not, but want to be, head over to the Park for a darn good time.
