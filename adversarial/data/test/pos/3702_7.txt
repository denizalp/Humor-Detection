I've been coming to Party Cake for as long as I've been eating. When I was a kid, I'd be given a cookie when I went in, one for each hand, by a lady working behind the counter. \n\nParty Cake hasn't changed much over the years, although their chocolate chip cookies used to be better. Methinks they took out that ingredient that made them chewy, which is how I prefer my chocolate chip cookies to be. \n\nThe best time to go to Party Cake there is early in the morning when everything's fresh and the good stuff hasn't been picked over. \n\nMy recent birthday cake was a PC creation, and my, was it a celebration of moisture and rich, buttercream delights. \n\nHowever, my favorite treats from Party Cake are as follows...\n\nPaczki: A round ball of a donut covered in sugar and filled with various things, I've found that I am partial to the ones containing vanilla and chocolate cream. Pronounced \"poonchkey\" in Polish, the saccharine spheres are only made during Lent. \n\nBrownies: Fudgy but not overly sweet blocks of cake topped with a rich icing, I always clean 'em out of these. \n\nPecan sandies: Somewhat crunchy cookies with pecans and covered in sugar, they have a slightly burnt taste to me for some reason, and it's a good kind of burnt. \n\nThey also have all kinds of other pastries, cakes, donuts, cookies, and such. \n\nYou'll go in,  the confections will flirt shamelessly with your nostrils, a young girl will greet you cordially, and you'll walk out with something. \n\nI dare you to not walk out with something. \n\nA neighborhood institution if there ever was one, Party Cake reigns benevolently.\n\nP.S. I have yet to visit the Mt. Lebanon store.
