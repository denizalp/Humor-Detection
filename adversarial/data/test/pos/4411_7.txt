I think AMEX is trying to court me into some higher annual membership fee credit card and I think I like it.\n\nWho wouldn't love a complimentary cocktail bar and buffet line to break up the busy hustle of travel? This is a haven for the weary, but not the masses. Take privacy in a little nook area or sit out in the dining floor and chat with fellow travelers. Super nice perk.
