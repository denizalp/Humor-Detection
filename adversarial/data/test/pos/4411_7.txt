Yelp has never let me down this bad before. The reviews for this place were great so I had to try it and it was absolutely disgusting. It was hard to find because it is just a shabby little building in a truck stop parking lot. I had expected that though because other reviews had commented on that but then went on to say how amazing the food was. That was not my experience. The place was filthy. The food was very mediocre. While I was eating a customer yelled \"that fly strip is f*****g disgusting\". I looked up and indeed there was a fly strip covered in dead flies that I had to view while I was eating. After my very mediocre potatoes and eggs I was enjoying a waffle that actually tasted very good. But when I got three of the four sections of the waffle eaten I noticed the long black hair on the plate. I moved it aside only to find three or four more hairs on my plate. I could not finish the fourth section of my waffle. I would recommend you stay very very far away from this place. When you see the building from the outside trust your instincts!
