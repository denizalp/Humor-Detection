I decided on a 3-star as it indicates \"A-OK.\"\n\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend them, but they got the job done.\n\nThe repair was for my water faucets behind my washer (where hot and cold fill hoses connect to). \n\nWhat happened is I was disconnecting the water hose behind it, I could take the hose off but the water was leaking. I could not turn the handle to turn the water off, it was basically stuck. So, what I wanted is a new handle on both so I could easily turn the water on and off.\n\nAt first, he said it would be $385 and I immediately said, \"absolutely not.\"\n\nHe said he was kidding.\n\nThen he said \"No, the real price is $285\" to do this job. I told him I thought that was a bit high and that I'd think about it, starting to lead him to the door.\n\nThen he said he could go as low as $245. but he didn't want his boss to be mad at him. lol.\n\nI was still starting to walk him to the door. He was explaining to me how they charge different people different prices for the same job - depending on if you were a property manager, repeat customer, new customer ... It felt slightly awkward.\n\nThen he asks, \"How much would you be willing to pay?\" I didn't tell him this, but honestly, I have no idea what the normal rate is for a job like that. I didn't think we would be wheeling and dealing. So I just told him a total of about $150 - that's what it'd be worth to me. Then he says, \"Well, I can do it for $195 - how would that be?\" I finally agreed. Then, he saying again something about how his boss might be mad at him for offering these prices. lol. Here's the thing, I'm an old lady and I view things with skepticism. I know we're not close and personal friends and he is certainly not going to risk cutting any deals that are going to make his boss upset with him. So, it just comes across as dishonest.\n\nWith all that said, he did an excellent job on the actual repair. I now have two faucets behind my washer that work great. He even let me try them out to make sure I had no problems in turning them. So he's skilled at plumbing. He was also a friendly guy and arrived within the promised time frame.\n\nThe only thing that bothered me is the thought that customers that are not as assertive and are more desperate for a quick repair - will probably be overpaying. They did do a good job on the actual repair, but probably won't use again.
