Screw this place.  I went here late night and rang the doorbell 50 times, I stood out there for 15 minutes and was never let in while there was people at the bar nobody would come to the door they Would look back towards the door when I would hit the button but nobody would get off their lazy worthless ass and open the door fuck this place lazy worthless bartenders probably smoking crack. They were probably having a meeting like the Sons of Anarchy this place is probably a cover-up for something else some illegal activities crack sales.
