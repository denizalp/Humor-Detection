I have given this Walmart numerous chances and every visit has been the same or worse.\nRude employees with the worst attitude I have encountered at a Walmart.\nDirty store, with open packages of food on the shelves... Like customers just come in and eat in the isles.\n\nSo, 3 strikes this Walmart is out!
