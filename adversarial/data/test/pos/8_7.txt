The lady we go to (Alice)  is Great at cutting hair, she has a wonderful personality and she has some great hair products at a great prices. That's the Good news abpout this place.\n\nThe Bad news is, the person at the front desk know's absolutely nothing about any of the hair stylists or their products and has a personality of a box! I have shown up there to buy product's from Alice on her day off and the lady at the front desk has basiclly told me to come back on another day when Alice is in! To me that is a waste of gas and Alice doesn't desirve that!\n\nTo the OWNER: Find somebody NEW to run your front desk!!! Give your stylist Alice a BIG HUG and a Thank you for being SO Wonderful!!!
