The three (or maybe like eight ;) ) times I've been to Pink Box has always been later in the afternoon thus I've only tried the \"leftover\" donuts, yet I still think they deserve 5 stars. If the less popular donuts were 5 star worthy, I bet the popular ones are even better. \nIt's a small shop in the plaza with BWW and Orange Theory Fitness (Worst gym placement ever, I would not be able to pass up a donut if I worked out there!) It has a few tables that you could sit and eat at and they accept debit\/credit cards. \n\n1. Matcha donut: sweetened matcha cream fill this donut and it's amazing. Move over Matcha Frappes, matcha donuts are my new favorite. \n2. Banana cream something: perfect mix of banana cream and chocolate. Second favorite. \n\nThe rest of the donuts were all good. They told me the S'more donut was popular, however that was my least favorite. The marshmallow inside was a little too thick and was too much for my mouth to handle. I felt like I was gagging on the filling.
