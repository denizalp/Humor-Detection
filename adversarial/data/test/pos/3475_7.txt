Went in for a consultation expecting to talk with the physician or PA. Instead has the office manager with no medical expertise suggest what I needed! WTF kind of place is this... Would not recommend if the PA doesn't even have the time to sit down with a potential patient to talk about the procedure or go over medical questions. If there were 0 stars to give I would. GO TO A BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN...OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AN MD!!!!!!
