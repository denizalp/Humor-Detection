Very good place, especially for their $9.95 lunch special. There's a good variety to choose from for your special, and the desserts are quite good. I love their rice pudding. If you're not a carb counter, they give you plenty of bread to munch on and complimentary Turkish Tea (not sure if this is a limted time thing). Love the food and love the service.
