Solid burger joint!\n\nEver since I saw the picture of the Bulgogi Burger I couldn't wait to try it. It just so happens I was just down the street from there so it's got to be destiny right? Located off of East Flamingo with Eastern being the main cross street, look for this place where McGoo's is just right off the street.\n\nAs I walk in I couldn't help but notice just how spacious the interior was so not enough seating was not gonna be an issue. If you refer to my pic, you could probably throw in some more tables and chairs if you wanted to.\n\nSo I order the Bulgogi Burger (7.75) and accompanied it with Garlic Parmesan Fries (2.99). I already had bottled water with me so no need to get a drink. My total came out to 11 bucks and some change. Not really what I wanted to spend for lunch but my excuse was that it was a new place so prices the first time around usually don't scare me away unless the food and\/or service is really bad.\n\nOk so the Bulgogi Burger looks as good as the picture. You get a 1\/3 pound angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and bulgogi beef to top it off on a decent bun. From the looks and taste of it, it looks like they season their beef while it is cooking. I asked them how the usually cook their patties and the guy said medium by default unless otherwise requested. The saltiness of the marinated beef was a good compliment to the beef patty. This burger does not come with ketchup or mustard but on every table there are ketchup and mustard bottles. If you want sriracha, tabasco, or A1 steak sauce, it is on their counter. Not sure if all their burgers don't come with sauces as a standard so I guess I will find out next time.\n\nThe Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good. They make sure to coat each individual fry with grated parmesan cheese and garlic powder. I enjoyed it very much. My Yelp buddy Shawn H got the Chili Cheese Fries and man it looked good. Definitely refer to the pic he posted.\n\nService was pleasant from start to end. They greeted me as I walked in, took my order, and brought it out in a timely manner. They even asked me if I needed anything as they were cleaning up other tables beside me.\n\nFrom their menu you can see that they have other items like wings, salad, and extras to add on to your burger. I think next time I will try their wings. I think its like 8 pieces for 9 bucks and you can add fries for an extra dollar.\n\nSo all in all my first experience was pleasant. They havnt had a grand opening yet so hopefully that is in the works. Maybe they can have some kind of lunch special so you don't go over 10 bucks for a burger, fries, and drink combo? That would be sweet. I would consider this a gourmet type of place. 4 stars for the first experience. We will see how it holds up the second time around down the road sometime.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #89
