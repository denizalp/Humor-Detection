This is a woman friendly location!!!  \n\nI had the pleasure of working with Mike!  He's was so wonderful and so very helpful.   I usually hate doing services on my car because I am a female and being that I have a nicer model car I feel like the service guys always try to nickel and dime me trying to get me to get services I don't need, when I go alone. \n\nI've been going to another location to get my car serviced and have never in 5 years going there received the exceptional service that I was provided last week.  Mike for the moment I walked in was a pleasure to work with and made sure that I understood everything that was going on with my vehicle and not once did I even feel pressure to do something with my car, he made me feel so comfortable and this is a feeling I've never felt when dealing with my car.   Got my car serviced without any hassles and left in a better mood than I arrived with.  I will be coming back here for all my future needs thanks to you MIKE!!!  United Nissan you need more employees like Mike!!!  Thank you thank you thank you!!!
