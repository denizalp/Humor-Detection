I usually go to my usual wax girl Alyssa (who is AMAZING) I love her. She knows exactly what I want without even me telling her and she always checks with me towards the end to see if Im happy with the results. However, because of certain events coming up, I had no choice but to go with someone else because Alyssa wasn't working that day so I went in with a girl named Bri. I have to say that this was the worst waxing appointment ever. I have natural thick eyebrows and this girl waxed off so much of my eyebrow that it didn't even look like the other one. She completely ruined my perfect brows that Alyssa had already created. Not only that, I also asked her to wax off the baby hairs that I have on my forehead and she WAXED MY HAIRLINE OFF to the point that I looked like Lebron James. Now I have these little hairs that stick in the middle of my forehead and are taking months to grow back. I would NOT recommend going to Bri. She does not know what she's doing at all.
