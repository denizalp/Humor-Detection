I was very impressed with Gordon Ramsay Burgr.  Like really really impressed, mainly with the service.  Yes the food is actually pretty good but the service blew me away.  The waiter who served us was absolutely the best server ever.  He didn't even need to write anything down.  How amazing was this guy's memory.  He had many tables he had to worry about too and the fact that he remembers everyone's orders (correctly too) has me extremely amazed.  But back to the food.\n\nI picked up the wings for starters.  I didn't realize that they give you 8 wings.  I was expecting a smaller portion but Ramsay really hooked it up.  They were big wings too and they tasted amazing.  The meat came right off and the flavors were outstanding.  The carrot toppings were ok, not to my liking but the wings were the best quality tasting wings I've ever had.  \n\nThe farm burger was really good too.  It had some really delicious tasting bacon meat and the egg was made to perfection.  Eggs and burgers are such a great match.  The buns with the sesame seeds was a bit ok but overall my burger was the bomb diggity.  I had my burger meat medium well and yes it was perfectly medium well.  Wow I though to myself this is one fantastic burger.  \n\nOverall the wait is pretty long for a big table but for just two people the wait wasn't that bad at all.  We waited for about 15 minutes and could have been seated early but I didn't wanna sit at the bar tables.  The service was outstanding and really made our night.  My chances of return are very likely.  I was getting pretty sick of burgers in general but the fact that I like says a lot.  Definitely give it a try.
