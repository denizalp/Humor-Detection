I took my beloved boots to Tam O'Shanter after reading Carmen's review and I was pleasantly satisfied. The gentleman took one look at my boots and asked 'Heels and soles?' and I nodded. That was that. \n\nI went back after 5 days, he told me I could come back in three. The soles and heels looked brand new, but then so did the rest of my boots, as they were fantastically polished. I couldn't do a better job polishing them if I spent 2 days doing it. \n\nGuess who's looking forward to winter now?
