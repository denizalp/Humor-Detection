Amazing Empanadas!!!\n\nPachamama specializes in empanadas from the Argentinian province of Tucum√°n, which are recognized as the tastiest within Argentina.\n\nIn addition, the empanadas are made unique by using natural dying agents like spices, spinach, or squid ink to give each flavour a colour.\n\nTraditional and gourmet varieties are offer. In addition to vegetarian and meat-lovers options.\n\nThe beef empanadas are made with diced beef instead of ground beef resulting in a tastier and jucier experience.\n\nIn summary, they are the best empanadas I have eaten in Montreal! They are even better than most empanadas I ate in Buenos Aires.\n\n=====================================\n\nNOTE (added 05\/07\/2017): The review by Catherine R (from 04\/23\/2017) recommending La Chilenita over this place, prompt me to get together with some friends and try both places on the same day!\n\nThe result: Pachamama wins by a landslide! Empanadas here are tastier and more filling (even when smaller in size). One way they are tastier (and juicier) is that they are made with cubed beef (instead of ground beef).\n\nAs for the claim that service here is too slow, this is because the empanadas here are baked right after you order! Whereas, La Chilenita re-heats their empanadas.
