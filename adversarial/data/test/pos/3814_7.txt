Do not know how this place got such good reviews.  Waitress or the owner of the place was cutting her nails in the back.  Secondly, food was alright, edible, but probably one of the worst if not the worst sushi places I have ever been to.  More customers came and waitress was still cutting her nails, I would really have forgiven her had she had stopped but seriously........how many people have to come into the restaurant before you stop.\n\nOnly one waitress for the whole night from 6-9PM so service was pretty much down the drain along with our appetites.  Only thing that really saved it was the fact that it was probably cheaper than a lot of other Japanese AYCE as the bill for two people after tax was under 55 dollars without tip.\n\nMany other great Japanese AYCE to go to but do not DO NOT go to this one warning you now =)
