I requested an estimate for cutting down 6 mature trees and cutting deadwood out of 2 mature citrus trees. Geoff came out to inspect the trees within a day, but said that he would email me the estimate. After 3 months of waiting for that estimate (which never came), I ended up hiring a different company.\nI try to be a patient person, but I think that I was just forgotten. :- (\nWow, the response from Agave is that because he spied a stray kitten in the corner of my yard he refused to serve a customer and didn't even have the courtesy to say that this was an issue. The day that Geoff was there was the only day that I ever saw that stray cat.
