Why do women pay full salon prices on a regular basis when there are fun, less expensive places like Carsten Institute of Hair & Beauty?  \n\nThis place is like a top-notch salon that happens to have students being trained instead of women who have already graduated.  You can tell it's run like a well-oiled machine and everyone is confident in their abilities.  They have good prices (with additional student discounts) and they carry only Aveda products.  It's not the least expensive cosmetology school I've been to but, they are definitely one of the nicest so it makes up for it.   \n\nI wish I could remember the name of my lady from a few weeks ago.  She tinted my eyelashes (student price $12) and did a great job.  It was more relaxing than a lot of my actual salon experiences.  Unfortunately she told me she was graduating and so I'll have to try someone else next time.  I'm confident in this facility though so I look forward to it!\n\nSee ya there!
