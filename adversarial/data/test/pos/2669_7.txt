The mobile check-in will save you an hour at 3pm. I was in and up in my room within 10 minutes. Friendly front desk, but not overly courteous, so so.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, the strip\/fountain view was just as seen on their website's pictures. Clean room, clean hotel. It is a non smoking facility and well you get the air and cleanliness that you would expect. \n\nThe hotel's ambiance is boring. It's low key and out of touch with the rest of the ramblings that go down in Vegas. The good parts come courtesy of the walkway to the Bellagio and from the Aria being across the roundabout. Their amenities are subpar. The pool is okay but their bar is terrible. Although I did not have a chance to check their restaurants out, I did find their shop in the lobby convenient for when you need the essentials. \n\nThe Vdara sets out to be what it advertises. A quiet upper middle class magnet. If you use your room for tranquility when you're away from the tables and clubs then you've found a winner. If you like your hotel to feed you the vibes...look elsewhere. Research it for 10-15 minutes, you'll get exactly what you expect.
