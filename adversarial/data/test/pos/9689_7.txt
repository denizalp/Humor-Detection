I went back and forth on whether I should write this update. Ultimately, I decided that sharing observations, positive and negative, was more important than listening to the impulse to write off part of the meal as a fluke.\n\nYonaka Modern Japanese is still the same old restaurant with bold combinations of flavors, but they've recently added a lunch menu. In addition to a variety of sushi and some of their signature cold plates, they've added some hot plates that are a bit more casual and accessible for lunching. I'm not sure how well that experiment has worked with the public though.Even though it was a weekday and not peak lunch, it felt surprisingly empty with only one other party in the dining area.\n\nOh well, more time to catch up with my foodie friend. Seeing as how it was inexplicably her first time, I was more than happy to revisit their signature dishes while dipping into the new lunch items.\n\nBrussels sprouts ($6): a customer favorite that I actually hadn't tried before. Some of the brussels sprouts leaves deliberately pulled apart to make it a more salad-like experience, and there's a nice char that adds the right amount of bitterness With a sweet and sour dressing, crispy puffed rice, lemon chili, and mint, it's about as good a brussels sprouts dish as you can get without including pancetta or bacon.\n\nSake orenji ($11): it's what the Double-Double is to In-N-Out or the Foie& used to be to the Goodwich a long time ago. With luscious fresh salmon, delicious slices of orange supreme (which my friend explained is actually a cutting technique that's pretty wasteful), crunching yuzu tobiko, and acidic orange oil, it's still as harmonious and delicious as it was the first time.\n\n(On a side note, I was pleased to see that the spectacular sake kale dish from my last visit was available, It didn't feel right to order two salmon dishes in one meal though, so I'll have to wait until next time to taste it again.)\n\nUni To Ikura ($19): it's one of those dishes where everything is artfully piled atop each other. The dish's namesake items are a salty salmon roe that bursts in your mouth and a clearly distinguishable and sweet-in-a-seafood-y-way golden uni, but pay attention to the delicious sea scallop base, the kabocha (squash), the shiitake, and the oddly-non-citrus-y yuzu kosho. There are six pieces, so consider dissecting one with chopsticks and using the large serving spoon on the remainde(s). You can distinguish all the flavors separately and appreciate how they combine into a satisfying bite.\n\nHana Wings ($8): an appetizer of roughly five pieces of crunchy fish sauce wings and a garnish of atchara (pickled carrot and papaya). It was very good, and the spice from the chili seeds was appreciated, but I'm not convinced that it's quite on par with the Thai Caramel wings at Flock & Fowl.\n\nMiso Ramen ($11): here's where the meal fell apart a bit. I will disclaim that we allowed this to sit around a bit, so naturally the noodles soaked up a lot of broth. That means I can excuse the low broth levels and the noodle texture (in retrospect, surprisingly still chewy). The problem here is that the broth tasted like a light miso soup and not the rich miso broth that I'm accustomed to at Ramen Sora. Also, the noodles tasted bland, which I can't explain away, and the naruto and negi weren't anything special. The bright spots were the egg (more of a medium than the ideal soft boil, but still great) and the chashu (fatty and very flavorful), but they couldn't compensate for the aforementioned issues.\n\nKimchi fried rice ($10): it's a pretty solid dish. The tender, meaty pork belly and especially the fried egg really brought it home. I actually fried up another egg to enjoy with the leftovers because one egg in that sea of rice just isn't enough richness. Sadly, I didn't have extra pork belly sitting around. This dish could also use some sort of sweetness, or perhaps bacon. Unlike the ramen, this is just a couple layers of flavor away from being a spectacular dish, and that one egg gets spread too thin..\n\nYonaka will remain among my easier recommendations for a nice meal for foodies and special occasions. However, I just can't and won't vouch for their lunch-specific entrees, at least not until I've tried some different ones and had positive experiences. Stick to the cold plates or dinner items (at happy hour if possible) and you'll have a good time. My friend loved lunch, so I'll still call it a big success.
