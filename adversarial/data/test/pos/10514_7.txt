Yes, you are reading this review correctly. I am reviewing an OnRoute rest stop on the Hwy 400 north between Teston Road and King Road. But why the heck not? If you haven't seen this place I think it's worth a gander.\n\nI've been watching Canadian Tire Gas bars and OnRoute gradually take over the 400 series highway rest stops from Kingston to Windsor and from Toronto north to Barrie. In fact in a past job where I was a death dealer (tobacco sales rep), I helped to set up the tobacco section for the 4 new OnRoutes from between Windsor and London.\n\nWith this new location taking over for the long standing barn which housed a shabby looking Tim Hortons and Wendys, I must say the future of long distance driving rest stops is here - and it is good. This particular location is like a hybrid of a Mall Food Court and a swanky coffee shop. Comfy seat 4 sets mixed with standard food court table and chairs surrounded by a great variety of food court faves. Tim Hortons, Starbucks, Teriyaki Experience, Big Smoke Burger and Swiss Chalet all reside here for your dining pleasure and for convenience on the go there is the OnRoute standard convenience store also known as M Market.\n\nTop highlights:\n- The Timmies is drive thru and you can actually hit the drive thru and then end up at the Canadian Tire gas bar. \n- Plenty of Parking\n- Free Wifi that doesn't require a password (also unlike most wifi hotspots you don't need to buy something to sit here). That's what we call a Money-saver bonus!!\n- Cleanest, most frequently maintained washrooms I've seen off a highway EVER! Seriously I think someone cleans it every hour on the hour (Mop, toilets, sinks, etc)\n\nDammit! I promised myself this would be a short one - ah well. Next time!
