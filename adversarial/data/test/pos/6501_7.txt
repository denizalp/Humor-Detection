that's it - I'm moving back to phoenix. All it took was for three local phoenix boys to open the perfect tavern where I can relax on a massive wooden porch with a pint of bass and wax poetic on the merits of the cure and the clash with a friend after work.\n\nRose and Crown is a gorgeous home (formerly circa 1900) turned London pub with a warm atmosphere and *killer* music selected on the jukebox. The music I attribute to one of the owners, Chris, who, I eventually discovered, used to play in a mid-90s local punk band called Plinko. I found this tidbit of info out while eavesdropping on a conversation he was having with a couple that was sitting up at the bar. They were chatting about a 1993 punk show in Phx where Circle Jerks and Skankin Pickle played. I excitedly shouted from across the room, \"Punk v. Ska?! I was at that show, too!\" turns out the owner's band, the couple, and I were ALL at that show, and now ALL sitting a beautiful wood bar relaxing with our English pints (which are 20 OZ across the pond, btw, not 16)  - did I mention I LOVE THIS PLACE? \n\nDeets: It's nestled in Heritage Square - and directly across from Pizzeria Bianco - on a faux street (it was once a street but is now blocked from traffic passing through) with about five other early 19th century homes-turned-restaurant\/bar. This really makes for a homey effect. Up a set of stairs and there's plenty of wooden tables and chairs on the enormous front patio (where, I might add, you can actually take your drink to - take that, Roosevelt!). inside is broken up into three rooms off of a foyer. the belly-up portion of the bar itself is kind of small - but there's plenty of high-table seating throughout the two rooms, and a pool table and dart board in the third.\n\nFood - didn't try it, but usual English fare; Shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, fish and chips. Happy hour meant $3.50 import pints (again, these are 20 ouncers) of Bass, Boddington's, Newcastle, Guinness, Stella...you get the idea.\n\nMy one major complaint - the parking. There is absolutely no parking near the bar. There are of course plenty of garages nearby - this is right downtown - but on a game night you get screwed. you can try your luck finding a metered space that doesn't require money after 5 p.m. like I did. \n\nBut that's not enough to deter me. The owner I mentioned before - who spotted me sitting at the bar alone while I waited for my friend and chatted me up - very much gave the impression that they're just three good friends attempting what every 20-30-somethings dreams about at one point - opening a cool bar. And they did. So go to it.
