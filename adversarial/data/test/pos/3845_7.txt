We received a free loaner car through the insurance company from Enterprise. \nWe scheduled a pick-up for 7:30 am from Sparkle Auto Body. However, when we pulled up to Sparkle's parking lot, there was no \"We'll Pick You Up\" rep present.\n\nSharon from Sparkle gave us a ride, instead. She said Enterprise will pick you up, but you might have to wait an hour.\n\nThe Enterprise was almost right next door, in the same strip mall that contain the Pizza Pit on E Wash.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by the customer service reps who quickly found our appointment in the system. We even got a free upgrade to a full-sized sedan.\n\nThe part that gets me - which I don't blame them because it seems to be a common practice in the industry - was the upsell on the liability insurance. If we didn't take Enterprise's insurance we are liable for all the damages blah blah blah their insurance has a lower deductible blah blah blah. Most car insurance will have coverage on insurance liability extending to rentals. I didn't like how they tried to sneak in the additional insurance by asking us \"if we wanted the basic or premium insurance\". Just be sure to pause, and relay that your carrier should cover any damages.\n\nThey made up for the salesman spiel later when we received our rental, the gentleman was so kind as to scrape the layer of sleet from the freshly washed fleet.
