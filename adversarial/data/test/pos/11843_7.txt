I really liked my drink! We came here after grabbing lunch around the corner at Cornish Pasty (which is also very good). It was a warm day and this place was super inviting with its doors open. I normally order a milk tea, but they don't have my standard Thai tea so I got honey lemonade at the regular sugar level and less ice, and boba of course. When I asked for boba, the friendly employee asked if I wanted regular or mini. \n\nMINI! \n\nAnother boba place used to have mini boba but they couldn't get it anymore. So I was excited to get this and it was so fun to eat. Well, you don't really eat them since they are very small so you end up just swallowing them all with your drink. My drink was refreshing and delicious, perfect for our type of weather. I'd like to try other flavors next time but I'm such a creature of habit so I may end up getting the same drink for a while. Glad this place exists! \n\nPS you can park at the City Hall parking garage located east of here on 5th st and your first hour is free.
