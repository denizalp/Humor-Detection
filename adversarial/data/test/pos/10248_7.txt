ermagawd.\n\nI came here with my grad school pal to celebrate the fact that one of us is graduating this semester (not me).  She loves her some Windy City Beefs because she's a Chicago gal and they have the deep dish pizza here.  Plus, everything about this place screams, \"I love Chicago!\"  Sports banners, posters, pictures are all dedicated to the Windy City--duh.  Michael Jordan looked down on us from the wall as we dined.\nDid we eat anything remotely healthy?  No.  OK, I had bottled water, Windy City bottled water at that.  And then, there were fries and a shared Chicago deep dish pizza, half cheese and half mushroom.  But, you don't come here to eat healthy.  You come here to eat like Chicago people, which means you're committed from the start, diets be damned.  So, I thoroughly enjoyed the fries and two slices of that deep dish deliciousness--the crust is wonderful!  And then I got stuck with taking home the leftover pizza because my pal said she's on a diet--WTH?!  Guess I'm on a diet again, too.
