Sometimes it's nice to get Indian to go and watch a good movie at home to get the weekend started. God, I really don't sound like the childless 20-something that I am.\n\nI ordered Shahi Paneer (easily the BEST paneer I've ever had, taste and texture-wise) and it was so delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and said it was the best he has ever had. I also loved their rasmalai which, again, had the perfect texture and flavor. We've been going to another Indian restaurant for years (a 20-25 minute drive) but have recently been underwhelmed by the food. I decided to try this place and I'm so glad that we did. Not only is it great, it's just around the corner from our house. Bonus!
