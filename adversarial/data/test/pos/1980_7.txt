Not real impressed.   Our first visit and we certainly expected more.   Burgers are good, along with the onion rings.   Salad are of good proportion but dressing are not good at all.   Very watered down and no flavor.   Same with some of the condiments. \nWe like ranch with fried zuccini.  The ranch was so watered down that it had no taste. \nWe won't be going back.
