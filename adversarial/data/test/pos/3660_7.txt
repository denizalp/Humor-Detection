The best egg waffles in Markham! \nI come here all the time with my friends and always have a nice chat with the owner! :)\nHe's super friendly and it's always nice to chat with him. He's really passionate with what he does and genuinely wants to know his customers better.\n\nHe doesn't make buns daily anymore, but you can order it from him as long as it's at least a day before!\n \nMy personal favorite is green tea and pork floss & seaweed, but all of them taste good!\nDefinitely a must try!
