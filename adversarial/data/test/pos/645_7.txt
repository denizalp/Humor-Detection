I have heard so many great things about this place (It was on Diner's Drive-Ins & Dives!) and we finally decided to get our taco-loving booties over there to try it! Ohhh my goodness, I am so happy that we did!! \n\nThey have the most amazing fresh salsa bar with at least 10 different salsas made daily. Being a sauce lover, this was a complete dream come true. I recommend getting the two taco plate with rice and beans. I got the Aztec Tinga Taco (Shredded Chicken, Tomato, Onion & Aztec chipotle sauce) and it was SO juicy with the perfect combination of spices. I also got a Carne Asada taco that was delish! The restaurant is small and I hear it gets busy so I would recommend dining here during off days\/times. We went on a Thursday night at 7:30 PM and it was perfect!!! We will for sure be back, i've been daydreaming of their fabulous salsa bar ever since we left!
