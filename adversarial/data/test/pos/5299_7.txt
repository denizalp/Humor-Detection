I'm a huge fan of Iron Chef Bobby Flay, so when I found out that he had a restaurant in one of my favorite hotels (Caesar's Palace) I was ecstatic. \n\nThe restaurant is across from the iconic Caesar's Sports Book, a place where I have watched and wagered on countless sporting events. After a day of watching sports in an electric environment it is a luxury to be able to sit down for an extraordinary dinner without missing a beat. \n\nThe food is classic Bobby Flay. A mix of NYC and Southwestern flavors balanced to perfection. The interior of the restaurant is modern and chic, but not overly formal. You can come dressed in a suit and tie or casual and feel equally at home.\n\nCongrats Bobby on creating a restaurant that is approachable to the masses yet serves world class cuisine.
