I went to La Pinata when it originally opened but I didn't remember the food and service being so outstanding.\n\nNestled away in the the eclectic Melrose area. La Pinata really stands out. The decor is modern with a neutral pallete, but they still have traditional Mexican flare sprinkled in to add some culture. Like the three Dia Dos Los Muertos musicians pictured.\n\nThe bartender was incredibly friendly. She kept checking in on us, and was always at hand for refills. I also think it was a nice touch when she brought plastic ramekins for our to go food. The margaritas she served were great. They weren't too sweet. You could taste the tequila and skip the heartburn. She also made us beer backs since we like to create our own Beer-rita.\n\nThe food was awesome! Their salsa is chunky, and has just the right amount of kick to it. If you need more heat they also have the hot stuff on deck. The shredded chicken in my enchilada and taco was tender and juicy. The enchilada also had green chiles and salsa that made my mouth sing. I'm so over one ingredient enchiladas. The beans were rich and creamy, and the taco was packed with flavorful toppings. Loved every bite!
