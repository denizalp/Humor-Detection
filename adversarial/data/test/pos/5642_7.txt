I asked my dog, Riley, what she thought of Metro Bark and her exact quote was, \"I think one of the things that I enjoy most is the very nature of the staff at Metro Bark, they are kind, caring and incredibly helpful -- like the time they encouraged me to jump in the pool and swim.  They take care of me when I am feeling a little under the weather and ensure that I eat my lunch when I remember to bring it.  Its pretty much like a Montessori School, but for dogs.\"  Labradoodles, smart smart dogs.  \n\nI like MetroBark because the staff is great! -- and really, thats about the only thing that is going to be a deal breaker for me when it comes to doggie-day care.  They know my dogs name, know her behaviors, and inform me in any changes in her behavior or health that they notice.  MetroBark's hours and location are convenient and their price is very reasonable.  The boarding option is also helpful.   And the doggie cams are an excellent distraction while you're at work -- watch the dogs have fun while you try not to think about your next meeting.\n\n While she can't really talk, Riley's tail wags all the way to MetroBark and she is exhausted when she comes home, so in dog language I think that says really good things.
