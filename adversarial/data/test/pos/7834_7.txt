So this weekend my 2 cousins and I decided we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \"flip-flop\" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \"flip-flop\" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive.
