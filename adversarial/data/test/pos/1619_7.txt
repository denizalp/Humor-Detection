Quick, cheap, and delicious crepes! We ordered the savory La Jolla for $7.50 which had bacon, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole, and chipotle mayo sauce. If you want a crepe that's loaded with meat, you should choose a different one. There were very minimal pieces of bacon. (That's the only reason I am not giving five stars.) The crepe comes with a choice of soup or salad. \n\nThe wait time was very quick and staff was friendly. We ate about 9:00am and by 9:30am, tables were all filled. Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table when we arrived.
