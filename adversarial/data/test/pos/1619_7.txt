Don't come here for the food, but they do have a good looking crowd with a lot of women vs the sausage fests we saw elsewhere in Montreal. That said most everyone enjoyed their meals, I'm just kinda picky. And critical. \n\nWith dinner we were able to stick around and not pay cover if there was one or wait around. Frankly I don't think u have to wait if u go thru the hotel portion of the venue as they'll assume ur a guest. \n\nThe food: I'm not sure what a supper club is, maybe it means u have few menu options? Only 3 apps, 3 mains, and 2 desserts to choose from. It looked like a wedding menu. Servers r extremely nice. But not that on point since they'd forget little things like utensils for dessert etc. Also couple of the servers were kind of stinky.  Please shower. \n\nFood was not bad. Ordered the beef tenderloin rare and it came out perfectly medium rare.  I'm a genius. It was very good. The rabbit billet app was described by the waiter as a pate and supposedly amazing. It kinda sucked. Well it tasted exactly like cooked tuna fish from those cans (chicken of the sea), so if u like well cooked chopped up tunafish u ll prolly like it. Not my thing - that said I finished the whole thing as I was hungry. The carrot soup others had was not bad.  Dessert was pretty good. Drinks have strange variable pricing - Crown Royale is $7, Chivas is $11, so drinks can be cheaper if u know what to order. \n\nLot of bachelor parties here. Weather sucked so the patio was closed unfortunately.
