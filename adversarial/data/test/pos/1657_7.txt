Something is wrong with me.\n\nNow, I know I am not the most \"normal\" person I know but something is really wrong with me.\nI love Abba.  LOVE LOVE ABBA.  I sang all of Abba's songs as a child, and have never turned my back on them, even after they disbanded.  My first tape was an ABBA tape.  My first record was an ABBA record.  LOVE them, so I will say - that is prerequisite #1 to truly enjoy Mamma Mia.\n\nBut that is not what's wrong with me.\nI have now watched THIS show, the Vegas Mamma Mia show, a total of FIVE TIMES.  I kid you not  - five freakin' times.  And.... (hiding head in shame) I loved it all five times!  The last two times, at least I did not start tearing at the end of the show (I'm telling you, I am NOT normal!) but I was still gleeful and on a high when the show ended.  Furthermore - I even watched the SF Mamma Mia.  Once, though.\n\nFolks, this is not a show where you come out with your life changed, and there is no deep meaning.  It is almost silly - very light, but FUN FUN FUN, and just an enjoyable time.  The cast is extremely talented, and some of them are truly amazing singers with outstanding voices.  \n\nI've sat as close as 3 rows back from the orchestra, and all the way back to the second  floor seatings, and while the view was that much better in row 3 - - I found the acoustics to be better further back.\n\nGiven the fact I have watched it so many times, I will say that the mood of the whole show is largely determined by the audience - - I have been there on some nights when it was like every single ABBA whore was there that night (like me, or even worse) and we all go apeshit at the end, dancing to no end, many women sobbing through smiles, and everyone singing like CRAZY.  And 1 or 2 shows were more subdued with an older, more mannered crowd, but I think that applies to any musical.\n\nIf you are looking for a FUN time with a talented cast, and great music, good laughs and just good humor - - try out Mamma Mia at the Mandalay Bay.  In spite of the mediocre ratings some people have given this show - - I think they just expected the wrong thing.  Yeah, the SF show was good  -  but this is a Vegas show.  It's more about having a great time than doing a serious production, British-style.  It's a great twist, in my opinion, to the original.\n\n\nThat said - I am due to go to the SF Mamma Mia (which is comin' back in September 07) and still have to go to the Vegas one ONCE MORE... but that's it.  NO MORE MAMMA MIA FOR ME after that.\n\nEven I have to draw the line at 8 times of watching one show, hahahahah............... unless, of course, I go to Broadway.  Then, all bets are off!
