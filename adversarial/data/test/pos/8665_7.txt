Spoiled by a friend I was treated to a lazy day at the River Ranch Water Park. (If you're looking for the pools, slide and tubing area the name is important to note. The hotel is *huge*!)\n\nLounge chairs abound and towels are included. Bars are sprinkled throughout that offer food as well. My only gripe (and this isn't actually a \"real\" issue) is purchasing drinks prior to the lazy river. There's a tempting bar *right* before you grab a tube. However, non-guests must pay with cash or a card. (None of us were carrying payment options on our suits. Drat!)\n\nBring regular clothing if mini golf is up your alley. As we floated by on tubes that looked like fun! Flip flops can readily be stored in open cubes before grabbing a tube.\n\nThis is a family friendly pool experience. (At least during the day.) Kids are excited to share the experience with adults. You'll look ridiculous wearing heels with a bikini girls. Kids will be eager to speed through the lazy river. (I waived them off with \"There's Traffic. No we can't move. There isn't any room. Your only option is to swim under us.\" Yes, there is a special place in hell for me.)\n\nOn the way out I noticed an adorable restaurant \"Hole in the Wall\" overlooking the river. The menu offered many more options than the pool. All reasonably priced. I heard there were two additional dining options.\n\nThe summer pricing for rooms is wonderful. I peaked online after visiting. Rates started at $99 in June. Neat!
