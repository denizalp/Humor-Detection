Service was super friendly and fast, but I am perplexed at the high average rating.  \n\nWe got to try several items on the menu w\/ the $25 AYCE deal and pretty much found everything to be just ok.  The pork and brisket were on the dry side and the ribs did not fall off the bone.  The meatloaf, onion strings and outlaw burger were tasty.  The best thing we had were the corn nuggets - fried creamy goodness!  Mac and cheese and loaded mash were ok.  Desserts had so much potential but didn't deliver.  Their sundae was ice cream with a little choco sauce on top, nothing else.  Banana pudding and peach cobbler were meh.\n\nIf you do go, don't have too high of expectations based on Yelp.
