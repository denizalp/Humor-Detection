In comparison to LAX (connecting flight) - this place is a Buddhist temple.  Good restaurant options in the SW terminal.  Limited interaction with employees.  But I dig the free (really free) Boigo (or bongo, or something) terminal WiFi.  Hopefully that won't go, as other airports have done, we hook you -- then we work you for $5\/ 30 minute connections.  C'mon airports.\n\nAnyway I am petitioning Los Angeles County to hereby move this terminal into the graveyard-to-civilization that is LAX.
