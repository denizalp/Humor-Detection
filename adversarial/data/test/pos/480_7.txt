Okay, we all know what McDonald's is.  We've all seen \"Supersize Me\" and we all know how bad this chow is for us.  But a few co-workers and I had to attend an off-site meeting and on the way back to the office, we stopped here for lunch 'cos we were short on time.  We needed to grab something in a hurry.\n\nSo as far as McD's burgers go--ick!  Big Macs--double ick!  The milkshakes have always tasted like chalk as far as I'm concerned.  But I do like some of their salads and I gotta admit, their grilled chicken sandwiches are fairly palatable.  So one star for the salads and one star for the grilled chicken.
