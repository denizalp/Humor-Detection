If you are up before the hens or still awake like the night owls and you're hungry, this place covers your cravings from  plates of comfort food, burgers,and sandwiches to salads, steak, and seafood available 24\/7!\n\nI initially scoped this place out because they served open faced hot roast beef sandwiches which hardly anyone serves up anymore. My husband was happy that I found this place and the gravy laden mashed potatoes and tender beef satisfied his taste buds and tummy. I like the bourbon glazed carrots that comes with it myself as well! \n\nMooching off Mr. B's plate: Gravy Fries! - only resto I know that serves it lunch dinner breakfast time.  Either brown gravy or country gravy smothered on french fries. It's good, but a little too salty for my taste.\n\nThe Bourbon BBQ Burger is another favorite that is ordered. Mr. B goes on and on how it's the best!(better than Fatburger)  The burger seasoned and juicy, comes with bacon and a bourbon sauce. \n\nLunch favorites- Baked garlic chicken wings topped with shredded Parmesan cheese , Sweet potato tots, deep fried, crisp out, moist inside. Mushroom burger with blue cheese cream sauce, it's different twist on a mushroom burger, I like how they smother the Burger in the sauce. You need a fork and knife though to eat it.  The turkey wrap with turkey, bacon and cranberry cream cheese and alfalfa sprouts is nice for a lighter lunch. \n\nThe Southern Stack for breakfast or 2am cravings..Cornbread topped with sausage patties, eggs over easy and smothered in a hamburger gravy ...think the Southern version of the Hawaiian Loco Moco ;) Prime Rib dinner on Thursday nights! Dessert I have yet to order. \n\nThe atmosphere, family friendly, laid back & casual, come in your shorts, sweats, (and dare I say roll in your pj's in the AM?) Just walk in and seat yourself.  Main room of restaurant is larger. Clean, never too crowded.  Boothes can seat 4 people comfortably, table seating can accommodate larger parties.  Bar area is separated by wall and closed doors. It reeks of cigarettes but that is expected. There are smaller boothes to dine set against wall. Late nights you have to get buzzed in. This place has been here since the strip mall opened and has outlasted many of the shops that have come and gone.\n \nService has always been spot on at all times even in the bar area.  Always friendly, they get our orders right even with the special requests we ask for. Drinks always filled. We're never rushed out of there.  It's not outstanding, oh-my-goodness kind of food by all means, but it does not disappoint and it's affordable.  Cant go wrong with that!
