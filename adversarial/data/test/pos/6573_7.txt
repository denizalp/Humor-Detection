Don't go here for breakfast! This place is so awesome - I want it all to myself! If you do go try one of the Eggs Benedict plates. They are to die for. I had the Chorizo II plate this morning and it was fab. A friend had the Eggs Benedict meets French Toast and it was like a angel sitting on my tongue. \n\nThe portions are huge. Don't be afraid to share. \n\nOh, and the reports of the restaurant being overrun by hipsters are greatly exaggerated.
