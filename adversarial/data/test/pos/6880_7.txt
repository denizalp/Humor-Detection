I'm back!!! Oh such good cakes keep me coming back for more.\n\nThis time I tried the tofu cheesecake. It's amazing! If you like Japanese style cheesecake (which tends to be airy and light), you'll love this. The cake itself is very light, not too sweet, the crust is thin made of graham crackers and black sesame seeds, which adds a nice flavour to the delicate cake.\n\nI've been here to many times, I think I've almost tried all their cakes. I'm still a fan.
