I strongly dislike the way this chain advertises super-low gas prices, then gouges you with a credit card fee. This is 2014, get with the program!\n\nThis location is often packed, despite other gas stations being on 2 of the other 3 corners at this intersection and they all have around the same pricing.\n\nHave only been inside to make a purchase once, and it was unbearably slow.\nDocking a star out of sheer irritation, as the pumps do not have ANY trash cans or paper towels available. Is this a cost-saving measure or do they just not want to have to hire someone to empty the cans? It's unnecessarily stingy and inconvenient.
