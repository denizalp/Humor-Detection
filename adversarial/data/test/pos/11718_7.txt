Anyone ever loved a bookstore for it's food? I think I am the first one. And here is why: I think I figured out new dieting tip. It is a well-know fact that American society over-eats. But hardly anyone knows why. I think the problem is that in this country we go to eat to places where we are expected to eat, or to be more precise, to over-eat. Let's say you go to the trendy burger diner with your friends on Saturday. Of course absolutely everyone and everything wants you to have a burger. And even if you were thinking: \"Oh I am going to have their Cobb salad\", the thought evaporates the minute you entered the joint and intoxicating smell of fresh French Fries started to claim your soul and stomach. Of course you will have the burger, fries, maybe even an appetizer and a beer. Simply because the place CONDITIONED you to do so. \nNow try to pull off the same at the bookstore caf√©. First of all, no French Fries for obvious reasons ( fat stains on the pages?), second of all, portions are smaller and you will not order two turkey paninins under the poster of \"Farewell to Arms\". You would think: \" Hemingway wouldn't have done it. He fought the wars through the freezing German rain, he was lucky to have a stale slice of Russian bread.\" If Hemingway wouldn't touch you, Jane Austin will. \"Seriously, two paninis young lady? How on Earth will you fit into the dress you saw on sale at Macy's? Other more reasonable ladies who had one Panini will.\" \nEverywhere you look in the store, you stumble upon someone famous, skinny, spiritual or all of it. I am not even talking about entire diet aisle which is strategically located a floor above, not to ruin your skinny Panini. And food tastes amazingly fresh in there. Because you are not burdened with expectations of it to be great. \nYou don't dwell on your dining experience there. You devour your food in the corner and then wonder around pretending that you are above all of that, just like Gandhi, and you are so spiritually transparent because only good thoughts and water feed your soul. \nYou can call it pretentious, I call it smart. Have dinner there once a week and I can guarantee you will finally fit into the skinny jeans sold at Urban Outfitters next door.
