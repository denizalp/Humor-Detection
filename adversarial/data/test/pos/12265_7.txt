Very nice resto\/bar in an area that apparently is part of Little Italy, so now I know!\n\nI found the wide selection of beers interesting, though I'm not really a drinker, it's always nice to have interesting options.  Bonus points for serving Scotch Ale, my favourite style, one which I find rather hard to come by in this city.\n\nI came by on the evening of the 2015 Canadian Federal Election around 11:30 PM, the place wasn't packed, there were a few others like me catching the post-election results and analysis on the big screen (projector, literally a big screen ;) ).  The atmosphere was very nice, and not too loud.  The service was very attentive, and the wait staff were eager to help me decide on some good eats.\n\nBonus points for the kitchen being open for food until 2 AM!\nBonus points too for the comfortable upholstered chairs!\n\nAs others have mentioned, you can write on the walls of the restrooms.  They're wallpapered with text balloons that you can fill in.  I found it quite endearing.\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant experience, but bear in mind this was a quiet night.
