Recommended by my wife, (how can you go wrong) this place like the express line at the store. You're in and out in just a few minutes. I've been needing an adjustment for some time , but was reluctant to go to some place new. My experience has been several costly x-rays, a ton of forms to fill out, and getting harassed into making a bunch of future follow up appointments. I came in for the first time and had one form to complete. By the time I had completed the form, the Dr. was ready to see me. He asked me a few questions, examined my spine, and went to work. 5 minutes later my neck and back felt so much better. He suggested I come in for another visit, but didn't pressure me. The price was very reasonable. When I paid, I got a card they can scan for when I check in for future visits. This is where I will come to have my adjustments from now on.
