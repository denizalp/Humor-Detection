Ah, good ol' 5 and Diner. We walked in and were greeted and seated almost immediately. To my horror we were seated by a Breeder and her 5 kids. One of the kids thought that the restaurant was her playground. She was running and screaming from the juke box back to her table. Honestly, I would have given the place a 3 if a manager had asked the lady to control her spawn. It was an accident waiting to happen and I couldn't hear what my lunch partner was talking about.\n\n I initially went in for a big, juicy burger, but my buddy and I saw a couple breakfast platters go by and it instantly changed our minds. I ordered eggs Benedict which came with a side of hash browns. I also ordered a slice of sourdough french toast. Well after a few mix ups with having to make sourdough french toast, I finally told the waitress to just give me a slice of regular french toast. The eggs Benedict were meh, the hollandaise sauce came out of a packet, I think, but Hey I was at a 5 & Diner. The french toast was very good! Nice and crispy on the outside and warm in the middle. yum. \n\nMy pal had a giant waffle with eggs and a side of hash browns. He said that everything was perfect. The waffle wasn't too dry and crispy, and his hash browns were cooked perfectly.\n\nWill we go back? Maybe. We will certainly ask for a table far from kids. Maybe that will bump this place up to 3 stars!
