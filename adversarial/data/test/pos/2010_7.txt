Stopped in to buy hubby a pair of sandals. Phoenix temps had exceeded 120 degrees. Way too hot for shoes and socks. CROCS carries a large variety of slippers and sandals easy to wear in the water and the sunshine. No metal buckles to get hot and burn sensitive skin. Lightweight rubberized sturdy material. Fair price. We bought one pair at regular price with 1\/2 off price of second pair.
