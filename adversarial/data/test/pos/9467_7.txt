Wife and I are looking for a new fridge, so this was one of our stops. They have a decent inventory, however we got tired of hearing how they work on commission and make sure we ask for them by name! I understand you need to make a living, but after you gave me your card. You do not need to continue and explain to me that you work off of commission three more times!
