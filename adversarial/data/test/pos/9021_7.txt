I checked out Logan's Roadhouse a couple of weeks ago for lunch. I picked up a buddy from Sky Harbor and this place popped into my head. We had a late 2 ish lunch so the place was not busy.\n\nOur service was excellent, the soda refills kept us happy. But not as happy as those dinner rolls. My dinning companion had never been to a Logan's before, now he can strike one more thing off of his bucket list. I mean, aren't those dinner rolls to die for?\n\nI had the pork chop along with the sweet potato fries. And let me tell ya, the pork chop was cooked to perfection, very juicy. And how can you go wrong with the cinnamon and butter in your sweet potato. I also had the perfectly cooked broccoli to balance out the meal.\n\nAnd of course the perfect ending to a perfect meal was when my buddy pulled out his wallet to pick up the tab. It must have been the dinner rolls!
