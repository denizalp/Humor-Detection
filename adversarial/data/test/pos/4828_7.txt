Huh?!?!  Did you say something?!  Oh!  You need a napkin!?!  Oh you weren't' talking to me!?!?   LMFAO!!\n\nIt is called the Shout House for a reason!   It is LOUD as hell and the perfect place to go if you don't give a crap about what is being said around you.  the drinks were ok and the food sucked.  But it's all about the atmosphere right? :-)\n\nthe piano guys were funny but it was honestly so loud that you couldn't understand a word that they were singing....but I knew all the songs so sang them all to myself! :-)  And because it was so loud....no one realized that I SUCK at singing!!\n\nIt wasn't horrible....but it isn't somewhere I would go for dinner and a show.  But for a drunken hunger fix....and to see a large drunk girl in a really small black dress fall off of the piano and show her bits and pieces to the whole audiance.....TOTALLY the place to be!!
