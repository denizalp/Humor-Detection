Woodlands is my go-to for some soul satisfying South-Indian food! My favorite is the mysore masala dosa (indian style crepes coated with a spicy sauce, filled with potatoes), followed by the south indian thali (which gives you the opportunity to try many different dishes) The dosas are always crispy and delicious (delicious partly because of the high sodium levels - hey, no one said the food was healthy! :) ) and of all the items in the 'thali', I love the rasam - it's equal parts tangy as spicy! the hubs loves the north indian thali; it's a great way to sample some really good north indian food. I'd recommend Woodlands to anyone looking for a wide range of delicious vegetarian food! It's a simple restaurant, service is quick and the food always tastes fresh. They can up the level of spiciness if you request it, and they're not kidding if you ask for your food to be spicy! :)
