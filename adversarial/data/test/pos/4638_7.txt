I went to this location to get my hair cut. When I walked back to the salon the guy greeted me. He asked me what I was there for. When  he went to get my stylist, I could see them both talking. He pointed at me and the girl rolled her eyes! I felt very uncomfortable the whole time. I'm not sure  if that's how you operate your business. But I'm totally not going back to this location.
