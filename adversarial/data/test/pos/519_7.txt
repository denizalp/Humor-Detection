Walked in and it was bad service already! I sat at bar with some friends. Bartender was rude, asked for a Jameson and ginger ale when he gives it to me it spills everywhere. No consideration! I guess this bartender name is Ryan he looks like complete tool with a girl attitude. As I sip on my drink I notice it taste like straight ginger ale! Didn't want to say anything, because I thought I could just order another one from a different bartender. But it was only one bartender that night. Decide to go sit at a table order wings and country fried steak sliders. 3\/10 My girlfriend orders me another drink she comes back with jack Daniels and ginger ale. I let the bartender know, I wanted a Jameson and he gives me a attitude. I tell him that the last drink he gives me tasted like straight ginger ale. He doesn't do anything and hands me my drink. I take it and it was tasted the same way!!! I go back to my table and watched him pour other drinks, this bartender gives everyone a teaspoon of liquor!!  I'm done at this point, ask for my check and just leave! I rather go to PTs where they have happy hour and they pour my drinks right! Never again!
