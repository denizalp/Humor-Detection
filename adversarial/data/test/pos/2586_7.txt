This was a different experience. Although the food was decent, the service was a bit awkward. I understand there was a language barrier but I really didn't understand why they did some things they did:\n\n1.) once we walked in they told to take any seat. We did but had to wait for someone to come out and give us menus. We honestly waited for 10 minutes for menus, there was only one other table. After waving the guy down to get his attention he just waved back as if he was saying hi. \n\n2.) when ordering, we asked if we could keep one menu in case we wanted to order more, and he took all of them back. \n\n3.) I ordered a Diet Coke and he brought back a half of a Coke.\n\nI know it was really just the language barrier so I don't want to be mean about it. The food was good! The chicken Banh Mi was probably one of the best that I've had!
