My experience was much like Myras. The product didn't take, in fact made no changes at all despite having 40 units of \"Botox?\" and 50 u of \"Dysport?\". Im using quotation marks because that's what they called it. I'm fairly young and this amount was enough to have completely frozen my entire face let alone my problem areas. There were other things brought into question as well. Just avoid them and you will avoid a lot of problems.
