NHL's Vegas Golden Knights. WNBA's Las Vegas Aces. USL's Las Vegas Lights FC. Triple-A Las Vegas 51s minor league baseball. And coming soon to Las Vegas in 2020, the NFL's RAIDERS!! Yep. Raider Nation. Silver and Black! The entertainment capital of the world, Las Vegas, is now a big-league sports town!\n\nIf you're in the Vegas area and want to learn more about the past, present, and future of the RAIDERS, I would recommend a visit to the Raiders Preview Center. It is conveniently located at the less congested south end of Las Vegas Blvd in Town Square, a nice shopping, dining, and entertainment center.\n\nThe entrance packs a punch with what looks like a jumbotron on each wall playing highlights of the Raiders. Further in, you can view the Hall of Fame Walls, Super Bowl rings from XI, XV, and XVIII games, memorabilia, the countdown wall, photo booth, and an interactive booth to view different layers of the new stadium. If you want to join Raider Nation and secure some seats at the future stadium, enter your contact information into one of the three \"Join the Team\" kiosks for updates.\n\nA valet parking attendant is available directly in front of the store, but I just parked near Whole Foods for free and took a short walk back. Enroute, you'll also get to visit the Raiders Image store where you can purchase Raiders merchandise.\n\nARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?!
