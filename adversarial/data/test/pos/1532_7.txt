OMFG Bacon-y Deliciousness! (if it's not obvious, this review is based on the Bacon Storm sandwich aka Bacon Foodgasm)\n\nFirst of all, let's be clear about my love of bacon.  Bacon is my muse, my raison d'etre, the meaty yardstick against which all other foods are measured.  \n\nFriends have sent me bacon lip balm in the mail, bring bacon instead of wine when coming over for dinner, and have brought me bacon popcorn back from progressive nations like Brazil.  \n\nBacon highlights in my life include having bacon delivered to me while in the shower, perfecting the bacon chocolate chip cookie, and THIS SANDWICH.\n\nNow, I will be honest, I had the opportunity to try out BlamWich when I made my glorious return to the professional lawn bowling circuit this past summer and instead I walked across the street and bought a sandwich at Spolumbo's.  For the love of bacon, do not make this mistake.  \n\nThe Bacon Storm isn't your typical BLT.  Lovingly placed in a fresh, soft roll is a fresh tomato, crunchy lettuce, a fantastic garlic aioli, and TWO types of bacon (regular and Canadian).  Your first bite of the sandwich brings with it a euphoria in which you believe that anything is possible.\n\nWhile eating the sandwich I alternated between extreme happiness and tearful sadness that one of the most delicious things I have ever had, was slowly disappearing into my expanding belly.  It was a bittersweet moment when the sandwich was over, but fear not, BlamWich drives around spreading bacon-y love throughout our fair city!\n\nDo yourself a favor and eat this sandwich. Yes, it's big, but don't get talked into sharing. Your friendship is not worth risking over the inevitable fight that will ensue over who gets the last bite.
