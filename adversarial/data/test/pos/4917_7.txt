Sprinkles makes a decent cupcake, but its not OMG melt in your mouth gourmet. It's for those that are used to eating the dreaded store bought cupcake. It's far from a Hostess.. don't get me wrong, but not amazing.\n\nI have to agree with the others that they put WAY too much frosting on these puppies. Of course it's the frosting that makes them LOOK delicious. Sugar high all the way. I hate to be the barrier of bad news, but duncan heinz out of the box cake mix tastes like as good as their devils food, as does the frosting from the jar. Save your money..
