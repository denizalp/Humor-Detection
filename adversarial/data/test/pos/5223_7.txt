Let me start by saying I never drink whiskey. Never. I don't have any in my house to serve others either. So with that as background, I was surprised to be taken here for a Father's Day present by my daughter. But hey, I'm game! And for the record? It was AWESOME!! I was blown away!! What a great place!! We had a scheduled tour set up and it was a pure delight! The owners are fantastic and make this a remarkable, funny (hilarious even), and informative adventure through both time and the distilling process. Who knew you'd come away with a history lesson you've never heard before and yet another reason to be proud of your Pittsburgh heritage!!\n\nTo start we had welcoming cocktails (never a bad idea!) but these were creative and imaginative! I mean whiskey with spinach, avocado and cilantro? Almost sounds healthy!! It was fabulous! On to the tour! While the place isn't large, the story is and it's so worth experiencing. Learning how they started, the history of the Pittsburgh frontier and how it relates to the Whiskey Rebellion, how the locally sourced ingredients are combined to yield an amazing product....Did I say it was awesome? It is!!\n\nThe sampling of the whiskeys at the end was a highlight - and this coming from someone who doesn't drink whiskey! They were great! And the bonus was the sample of gin they also make - which I found out is just one more processing of the distilled product to yield those juniper and other flavors found in good gin.\n\nCouldn't recommend this any higher. Register for and take the tour. Drink the whiskey. Support local entrepreneurs who have launched an adventure they'd like to take you on. You'll be glad you did. And  bring friends!!
