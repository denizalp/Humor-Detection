I would recommend this ride to everyone but beware of the staff. The people in the ticket office were great but once you get on in the attraction it stops. Starting with the person that checked your ticket to the people that fit the harness on you, people that put you on the elevator, ones that got you set up on the ramp thing to lay down to prep and finally the guys at the landing pad not one person was nice. Downright rude. I guess one guy cracked a joke to a co worker on the landing pad that made me laugh. Oh and the gal selling the pictures was pleasant. \n\nWe were there 2\/23\/17. We were the second run of the day on the top line. The gal scanning the wrist doesn't say hi or welcome. Just grabs your wrist and scans them. Then point to a gate and says go though there. We walk by a bin of black bags. I wonder if they are the bags i am supposed to put my stuff in. we are in line and no one has bags. the buy harnessing the group in front of us questions them why they don't have bags. they grabbed them. Then he YELLS at everyone else in line \"why don't you have bags? everyone needs a bag whether you using it or not\". OK fine. We grab a bag. We would have if the person checking the wrist bands would have told us to take one on the way. He could have also told us nicely. Then comes our time to be fitted and that was not a pleasant time either. The people doing it certainly did not enjoy interacting with people. With no verbal interaction just yanks on the straps etc. One gal put her bag back in the bin as she did no need to put anything in it. He yells \"you have to have a bag\". She says why. He says \"cause you have to\". she takes it. we get in line to wait for elevator. She asked the person on the elevator if she needs this bag as she has a cast on and did not want to carry. In a rude voice she is told \"everyone needs a bag\". Fine. We get to the top. First group is told to get on the spots via rude tone and pointing. This gal again inquires she tired of holding the bag. \"EVERYONE NEEDS A BAG\". as we then are pointed to the dots to get on the ramps the one guy finally says \"you need an empty bag cause it helps us get the pulleys back\". AHHHH OK. could not all 16 of us be told that when we entered? Could have save a lot of grief as there were a few people inquiring the whole time. \nI now ready to get on the ramp. I laid down and realize my shoes are loose fitting as I am not standing in them I ask the guy hooking me up if I should put them in the bag. He says \"you should have thought of that before now\" as he takes them off of me and shoves them in the bag. I said I was sorry I did not think of them till now as I standing in them. to which he has no response. \n\nOK we are off. What an exhilarating ride. So much fun. I Cant describe the feel and adrenalin rush. We get done and they pull us in. We get no instruction whatsoever. I start to roll and am told to \"stay put till the ramp comes up\". Then get pointed to where to take off harness. Got helped with no courtesy shown. we leave. \n\nThis is only the second one star review I have ever posted but the herding cattle approach to customer service is awful. I would like to do it again but refuse to give money to anyone that makes a profit off this type of service. We were the second group of the day at 1:00 when they open. I can't imagine the groups at like 4 or five when these same people start to get fatigued and tired of people. How bout a few things like: \"Welcome to the Slotzilla. May i scan your wristband? Please take a bag as you pass them as everyone needs one for the pulley system. Step over here.\" and then as you approach the harness people \"Please step on this dot as I put the harness on you. I want to be sure it is tight for your safety. Step over here as you await the elevator\". Then up at ramp \"Oh, no problem. Here I'll put your shoes in the bag\". At the landing pad something like \"Did you enjoy the ride? pleas stay put till we get you unhooked. Ok head over there tand they will get your harnessing off. THANK YOU have a good day\". \n\nEveryone in line talked amongst eachoter about how rude the service was. I assured the group from New Zealand that not everyone in America was like this. The staff made what was one my favorite things to do this trip to something i will never do again. As much as i would like to zip line Fremont at night I will never take a chance on that treatment again. I don't expect to be treated as a king but as a human is not too much to ask for.
