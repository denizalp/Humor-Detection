We needed to move from AZ to WI and considered a traditional sale. Having seen Doug on on Property Wars (A&E) and local advertising we thought this sale method might be an option for us.   Once I provided our home's basic info via phone Josh called with a sales price range estimate. We agreed and Josh Barton came the next day for first hand look and discussion. He noted our house was very clean but in need of updating. After a tour of the home we had a discussion of home features, up to date maintenance\/repairs, and neighborhood market data.  Josh provided an offer  that worked.  It's remarkably easy to sell to Doug and his team.  Staff is friendly, professional, prompt, honest, forthright, responsive, knowledgeable and accommodating. No fees nor commissions,   Josh worked with us to establish a mutually acceptable closing date. No delay in the sale and funds were transferred to us on the closing date without delay. By far the easiest property sale we've ever experienced. I can't thank them enough for the peace of mind and excellent transaction.  I highly recommend Doug Hopkins and his team!
