I am not sure what people want out of this mall but it suits my needs just fine. \n\nAfter a game I can go to the movies. Before the game I can eat and have a few cheaper priced drinks. We can hang out at the Piano bar without kids (ASU) starting fights. I can eat, drink and dance at Margaritaville and not be worried about having a good time. \n\nTrendy... meh, you can't fill a mall with Mom and Pop type places. \nGhost mall... just like everywhere else. \nParking... Open and FREE\n\nThis place has no culture like Cen Pho but it can be a good time.
