A good spot for TOMS hunting! I admit: I have a bias towards locally owned boutiques simply because I want to see more of them do well in Vegas. Ultimately, it leads to better gifts for everyone! Despite the somewhat disconcerting name (because who really wants to self-label as a hipster?), I have visited R+D on two occasions. On the first occasion, I thought things were a tad overpriced, but the selection was interesting, very LA. I was store neutral.\n\nMost recently, I have been on a quest fo shimmery TOMS. I don't own a pair and quite honestly, had thought them pretty darn ugly. However, when in need of a flat to wear with socks, I decided they were a good option, especially when they shine! When I noticed a sign in the Boca Park lot announcing R+D carried TOMS, my husband coaxed me into perusing their selection. \n\nTheir selection of TOMS is huge! They have a variety of colors and styles for children, women and men. They even had a limited edition metallic style that I had not seen anywhere, and after being told they didn't have my size, the owner stepped up to try to help find a replacement. She had them run an inventory of everything in my size, and voila: it indicated they did indeed have one pair of the shoe I coveted in my size! The owner went in the back and found the elusive pair, and I left the store elated with my discovery and purchase. \n\nIn additional to clothes and TOMS shoes, they also have jewelry, some cute gift possibilities for your trendy pals and even their kids, other shoes, TOMS sunglasses and some items from local artisans. If it hadn't been for the owner, I don't think the aloof staff would have found my shoes, but the owner was helpful and knowledgeable. Overall, this trip was store positive!
