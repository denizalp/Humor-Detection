Stumbled upon another CoCo location. We were heading towards the other bubble tea shop in this plaza but couldn't stop ourselves from going here. It is their soft opening, so I'm not actually sure when this place opened. I love CoCo's drinks because you can ask for no ice but the drinks are still chilled. I don't really like ice cubes diluting my drinks. They also use real fruits in some of their drinks. My favourite being Grapefruit Green Tea that has red grapefruit in it.  This store does not accept Vicinity cards, it uses fivestar rewards. You just punch in your telephone number and your drink points are added  automatically. No need for a reward card, much better. Can see myself coming here every Tuesday, while waiting for my kids to finish Chinese school.
