Traditional Thai flavors with some modern culinary twists?  Hmmm?... could go very, very wrong.  But, the chef here blends it all together well. \n\nThe biggest problem I have with this place is price.  $19 for a small serving of pad Thai?...steep!  Rent around this area must be a doozie. \n\nAnd sorry to say, but service  isn't always great.  \n\nWe tend to stay away from dishes that aren't anything special and that we can get elsewhere for much cheaper (like pad Thai).  \n\nWe do enjoy the Grilled Salmon-Avocado Curry\n(in green curry with eggplant, avocado, & zucchini), Fried Spinach, Eggplant with Thai Basil, & Garlic-Basil Lamb Chop. \n\nGive it a try.  But expect to pay twice as much as you would at other Thai restaurants for small portions.
