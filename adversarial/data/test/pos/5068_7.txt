Went in to purchase a set of strings and was lectured for 20 minutes about how warped my bridge is. The woman helping me literally repeated herself 4 or 5 times. In the end, I got what I came for, but due to the unwanted lecture, missed an event I had planned on going to. Also, they charge $10 or $12 to put on new strings for you. I think it should be complimentary considering how simple a task it is. Anyway, most of their stuff is pretty pricey. If you are a student musician who doesn't have a lot of money to spend, I would consider purchasing your supplies online.\n\nNote: they have two golden retrievers they just let wander around in the shop. They are very well behaved and love to be petted, but if you are allergic, this might not be the best place to go.
