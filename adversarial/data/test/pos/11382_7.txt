As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, in the interest of full disclosure, I was a Mercadito fan. I went into Libre hoping it would be something similar. (I was told by a friend that works with Light group, the group that owns several of the restaurants in the Red Rock, that they basically forced Mercadito out in order to place their own restaurant there).\n\nThe drinks were nothing spectacular. The server hyped up their happy hour special that was a shot and a beer for a price that \"basically gave you a free beer\". We had two of those specials, two cocktails, an extra tequila shot, and the ceviche taco appetizer, total came out to $80. Let me also say, thank goodness I wasn't very hungry, because the size of these tacos... Oh man... They're supposed to be 'street taco' size, but they look more like Fisher-Price toys when you buy your kids their first play kitchen. I ordered the cucumber cocktail (can't remember the name exactly) and it wasn't very good. Being a proper alcoholic I still finished it of course, but I long for my Misty's Sleeve from Mercadito! Not likely to go back judging by the size of the food versus the cost.
