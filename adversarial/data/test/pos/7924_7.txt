We were looking for a restaurant for a quick bite before the airport and dude remembered a Japanese restaurant in this strip mall; however, now it is a Chinese restaurant.  So looking at the menu, we thought we'd give it a try, plus we were hungry!  Lunch specials were pretty reasonable but dude likes to share so we started off with chicken lettuce wraps and then had the combination stir-fried noodles.  Service was friendly and food was good.
