Club Hopping in Vegas is a dangerous move!\n\nWhy you ask?  Because you are not guarenteed anything unless you buy a table.  However, this particular Friday Night me and the boys were in luck.  On the way to club #2 We we're stopped by a promoter for The Cathouse.  The promoter decided to let us in.  (Whoa!)\n\nI was expecting the worst since this was a club willing to let three guys with no girls in the club FOR FREE....on a Saturday Night !.......FOR FREE!!!  \n\nThe club was packed and turned up!  The DJ played good up to date hip hop music, and some old good songs as well. The bar offered good service.  The bouncers were not jerks.  The crowd was a multi culti group of 20 somethings with a splash of 30's.  The dance floor was small but my days of tearing up the dance floor is over any way.  \n\nI think this small club is definitely worth going to prior to the big club, heck, I could have stayed there all night.
