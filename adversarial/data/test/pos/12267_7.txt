When I walked in the door I was greeted by a beautiful young thing sitting behind a desk at the front of the store.My niece had sent me a flat Stanley and I was snooping around town looking for places to take him. My travels or I should say our travels brought me the Butter Toast Boutique. she was kind enough to acquiesce to a picture with Flat Stanley and he and I browsed around the store.\n\nNow that Valentine's Day has come and gone this advice will do none of you gentlemen any good until next year, but here we go. For you dimwits who went to 7\/11 and bought a rose or maybe you would find her tastes whose gifts still bombed. If your counterpart was forgiving enough to keep you around till next year. I might suggest you go to Butter Toast Boutique and show her that you care little bit more next year than you did this year. have a lot of cool handmade jewelry, vintage clothes and the like. I have big love for all owner operated businesses. I love the personal touch, and you can definitely expect that here. Ladies don't wait and guys don't be a fool forever. But most of all people of Phoenix. Spend your money at businesses that are locally owned and operated because they spend their money here, and in time we will again have a vibrant economy.
