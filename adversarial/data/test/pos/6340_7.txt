Always busy on weekends, Bubblemania is usually the de facto spot to head for bubble tea and chat with friends.\n\nAMBIENCE\/SERVICE: A decently large establishment that can get quite stuffy and loud on busy nights. Lighting is rather dark. It's also a nightmare to park especially when it's busy. Staff is friendly and servers were quite attentive. 1.5\/2.5\n\nFOOD: When I am hungry, I will usually order the Pacific or House Special Fried Rice, which are both quite good and a good portion for one person or even to share. The bubble tea is generally hit and miss, most drinks are a bit overpriced for how mediocre they are but the pearls tend to be pretty fresh. I was excited to try their HK style milk tea and coffee, hoping it would bring back memories of Vancouver, but alas, it was only an expensive knockoff. 1.5\/2.5
