My wife is vegan and finding good Pizza that is dairy free can be difficult.  The manager at this location insists that the pizza crust is vegan.  The crust and sauce are great and we order carryouy Nd delivery all the time.  My wife loves to get a peppercini pizza without cheese.\n\nLastly, the pizza prices are reasonable (under 17 bucks for two) when utilizing one of their great coupons.
