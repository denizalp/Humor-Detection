I've been here a few times with friends for drinks during peak times on Saturdays.  If you can find an opening at the bar to order your drinks, you will get them fairly quickly.  However, once you go to the back patio, service is non-existent.  The atmosphere of the patio is fantastic, decor is great.  But for as huge of an area as it is, you will NEVER see a server back there.  Our bar tab there, for 6 people, would probably be around $150-$200+, but because of the lack of service, we get one, maybe two drinks and we go elsewhere.\n\nBeing from Chicago, I had to try the Italian beef.  The beef is outrageously dry.  It has the texture and flavor of being boiled.  No sear or even a bit if browning, just boiled meat.  No amount of au jus can save the beef that's drier than the Phoenix desert.  This place needs to seriously step up their game, when I can make a better sandwich, at home, with probably less expensive ingredients, there's a big problem.
