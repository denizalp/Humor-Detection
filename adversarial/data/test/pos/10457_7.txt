If there was a zero rating I would give it.  Yesterday I went for a hair cut and now I look like a retarded child who was forced to join the military.   I walked in to the salon, and gave a very specific instruction.  I requested only a small trim to the front and side and cut only the back hair short. \n\nFirst thing the owner of the shop does when she picked up the scissor is to start cutting my front and side furiously.  The whole time she is butchering my front and side, she is rambling about tv shows, and how popular her hair salon is and that people drive all the way from Markham just to get a hair cut from her.  \n\nThis lady is full of herself with very mediocre skills.  She was talking so much as she was cutting my front and side, by the time I notice what was happening, it was too late.  By then I had to ask the stylist to cut my back hair shorter than what I was planning to originally to match my messed up front and side.   Anyhow the end result is that I look like a retarded child with a military hair cut gone bad.  This could have been all avoided if the owner of the shop talked less and paid attention to the customer.   Listening is a key skill as a service provider.\n\nI did let her know she was cutting too short as she was cutting my front and side but she was too opinionated to listen to my instruction and concern.   My hair was ruined already, and there was no going back.  Given how full of herself she was, and already ruined hair, and my plan never to come back, I left without having a full on conversation with the owner about the experience.\n\nPro:\n\nVery cheap price.\n\n(I paid $15 and change, and yes I did not pay any tip, as I need to grow out my hair and pay to fix it.   My tip to the owner of the salon would be to listen more, talk less)\n\nCon:\n\nYou get what you paid for.  \n\n( If you are on fixed income and desperate for the cheapest haircut in Mississauga, and you are ok with mediocre to bad haircut, you will be happy at Vic & Le Salon)\n\n\n\nGood luck out there consummers;-)
