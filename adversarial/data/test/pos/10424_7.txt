Another great spot to cool down during these sweltering summer months! Agua el Manantial has two convenient locations for all your water-related needs: this store in the Twin Lakes Plaza at Rancho and Washington, and another in the plaza behind Tacos el Gordo on E Charleston. The first detail I noticed was how clean this place is inside. There are large reverse osmosis tanks behind the counter and blue walls that make the place feel very calm. For being a water store\/Mexican candy shop\/ice cream and snack bar, it's fortunately missing that dirt factor that I've encountered at similar businesses. \n\nIf you're needing alkaline or regular purified water, you can get that here. A blue sign above the door advertises \"RASPADOS Y BIONICOS\" and I've tried both. I appreciated the tart tamarind syrup on the raspado, but the snow cone was hard to eat with several very large ice chunks in the styrofoam cup. I love shaved ice but this is just crushed ice. The bionicos (sweet fruit salad) was a huge portion of fresh papaya, cantaloupe, strawberries, and banana covered in sweet cream and topped with granola, raisins, and coconut. \n\nThey also offer fresh juices, traditional aguas frescas in various flavors including alfalfa, a few brands of paletas, and Dreyer's ice cream. The shelves are lined with candies that one would find in Mexico and there's some unique selections in the mix, including lollipops in the shape of pollo a la brasa but they don't taste like chicken. They even sell pi√±atas, so you know what to do with all that candy.
