I like this place. It seems my yelpy friends are divided in their opinions, but I've had positive experiences both times I've been.\n\nSuper kitschy. Yep. There's random stuff everywhere on the patio. It's like Cracker Barrel and a high school welding class had a love child and painted it with bright colors. \n\nFood is delicious, though. I finally was able to try the lemongrass tofu tacos, which had been previously recommended...but on my first visit were sold out. So good. A little on the chewier side than I'm used to when it comes to tofu, but the lemongrass flavor paired really well with the blueberry salsa\/sauce.\n\nAnd the jalapeño cheese grits were, while not necessarily the most perfect complement, a true force to be reckoned with. So, so good. They put most other cheese grits to shame. the jalapeño kick is a swell addition.\n\nSiracha on the table, which makes the Mr happy. He indulged in the buffalo shrimp tacos, which hit the spot. I sampled a taste of the buffalo sauce and was pleased with the flavor.\n\nOverall, a solid choice. I'll definitely come back...and bring some friends who need to see the Krazy side of the QC!
