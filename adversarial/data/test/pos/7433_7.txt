NAYSAYERS GTFO!!!\n\n\nIt's the second time I did business with these kind folks and it was always a pleasure doing business with them... \n\nI have a bit of auto-tech background in me. I went to school for it and I do all of my vehicle maintenance, but getting a smog check on both of my vehicles is not an option. I don't have the equipment to perform these tasks, so I have to go to these guys to get them done. They perform smog checks for $10 out the door! That's 50% cheaper than any other smog check places, plus I get a FREE vehicle inspection!!! \n\nAlthough it was a challenge looking for their shop the first time around because it was placed in the back of the lot, I managed to find it.  As soon as I step in their clean lobby I was greeted with their friendly staff right away with a smile. Their office is a little bit dated, but they do have a leather reclining chairs, not brand new, but comfortable and there's a big screen TV. It may not be the \"STEALERSHIP\" I mean \"DEALERSHIP\" ambiance, but it does have that \"LOCAL SHOP\" atmosphere that I like. There's also stores and a place to eat near the area to get something to eat or walk around while your car is getting work done...\n\nThey are located about 15 mins away from my house, and even if there's a smog check place 5 mins away from my house, I rather drive the extra mile (NPI) to get these folks to work on my car. Wait is not too bad since the last time I went, it took them 45 mins and the second time took 1 hr 27 mins from the time the service manager grabbed my keys to the time they handed it back to me...\n\nBottom line is, they are really friendly, their price is great! I mean have you been to a dealership for a quote? lol not just for smog check but for repairs... the place is convenient for me and the wait time is waaaaay below average compare to other shops. I never felt that they forced me to do repairs on my car, but they always suggested maintenance that needed to be done in the near future... I will continue to do business with them for as long as I live here in Las Vegas...
