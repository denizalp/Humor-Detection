Maybe it's just me, but I got a definite older middle-age meat-market vibe from this place, that brought to mind tales of Westlake's Viagra Triangle.\n\nThat's not to say it was awful, just sort of strange.  I take that back, this is exactly what I would expect a wine bar at Crocker Park to be like.  The decor comes off as trying a little to hard to be hip which makes it feel a little inauthentic.  The international symbol heiroglyphs on the wall were perplexing, and the squat stools to sit on across from the sofa-booths around the edges of the room were a little awkward and uncomfortable.  \n\nOn the positive side of things, the service was very friendly and attentive.  Empty plates were cleared promptly and our glasses were rarely low or empty for long despite it being a somewhat busy friday night. \n\nThe place isn't set up for heavy duty dining, so I can understand the emphasis on small plates.  That being said, of the several dishes tried at our table(s) all were good, but none seemed to distinguish themselves as special.  Couple this with most items being on the pricy side for what they are and the food was a little bit of a let down.  \n\nI don't drink, so I can't speak to that element of 87 West 2, and as it's a framed as a wine bar it's entirely possible that I missed out on the best they have to offer.  I would not be upset if I wound up here again, but I don't know that I would go out of my way to make it back.  I'd also like to give them props for their monthly foodie nights done in collaboration with the Culinary Vegetable Institute.
