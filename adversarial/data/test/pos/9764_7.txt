Stopped by earlier to have a late dinner with my partna in crime, LiLy D. \n\nI called them at almost 10:30pm to ask what time the kitchen closes. The guy said, \"we close at 11\" I said \"so it's ok if I come by in 5 minutes?\" he says, \"I'll let you slide\"\n\nWhat we ordered:\n1 lb shrimp Hot N Juicy Sauce Medium Spicy \n1 lb shrimp Garlic Butter Sauce Spicy \n1 lb crawfish Hot N Juicy Sauce Medium Spicy \n1 order dinner rolls \n3 Blue Moons\n\nThe food was hella good as usual. The employees were cool about us making them stay past their closing time. They never rushed us and even asked if we wanted more beers. \n\nI noticed on the very bottom of the bill said something like \"WRITE A REVIEW ON YELP\"\n\nI asked my waiter when they started having that on the receipt and he said it just started yesterday. That is effin AWESOME!!!
