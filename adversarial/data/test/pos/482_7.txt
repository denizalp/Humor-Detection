Hello friends,\n\nThis place packs a punch.. or bunch..ahhh maybe a bit of both. I must admit my 1st time there I walked thru & told my friend, \"this place reminds me of Common Market near the Chicken Coop\". His reply.. \"It IS C.M. I guess you didn't see the sign\" \n\nWell anyyywayyyyy, on a busy night it can get tight on the inside. Since i was enjoying a fine stooge I stayed on the outside in front (which was pretty big). My bud bought a 6 pack of a mix of beer and we were off!!\n\nGo enjoy,\nTTFN
