Man, I miss Mickey's Hangover! Firehouse beats the building being left empty, but I seriously doubt old town needed another club. I'm probably just bitter that I am getting too old to frequent 20-something dance clubs... I liked the patio most, inside you can't move or talk (on the weekends) much less get a drink.
