The McCarran airport is like a combination of Vegas headline acts:\n\nSlot machine studded gate areas that are as noisy as the Blue Man Group.\nLong security lines that can be as irritating as Celine Dion.\nGift shops that are as cheesy as Wayne Newton.\nPassengers that are as diverse as Wayne Brady's impersonations.\nEdible food options that are as scarce as Carrot Top's jokes.\nLocation to the Strip as close as Siegfried was to Roy.\n\nLooking forward to checking out these \"acts\" again...
