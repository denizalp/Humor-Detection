Eh..it was alright.\n\nMy wifes mother is in town and she was given the duty of baby sitter the other night so that me and my wife could go out on a date.  We decided to hit up Macayos.  It was close, we had never been before, and Mexican food usually hits the spot.\n\nI ordered the \"Tour De  Macayo\" which included a chicken chimichanga, a cheese enchilada, a beef taco and some spinach artichoke type dip.  It was billed as \"smaller portions of your favorite items so you can try them all out\".  Sounded alright.  It was only $11.99 too, which isn't bad.  My wife got the \"Original Combo\" which consisted of a beef taco, cheese enchilada and bean tostada.  Hers was only $9.99.  I had water to drink.   Chips and salsa were served shortly after we sat down.  Here is how the food was.............\n\nChips and Salsa-  Good.  Chips needed a little bit of salt though.  Nice and warm and crispy.\n\nTour De Macayo-  The first thing I noticed when this platter came out was how small the items were.  They weren't joking when they said \"smaller portions\".  I started with the chicken chimichanga.  The taste was good and it was a solid tube stuffed to the brim with chicken.  I tried the cheese enchilada next.  It was your basic cheese enchilada, red sauce.  Decent but not great.  Next up was the spinach artichoke dip.  Nasty!  It was cold and didn't taste good.  I took one bite and left it to the side.   I left the mini beef taco for last.  This thing was tiny.  It was barely as long as my index finger.  3 bites and it was done.  Taste was good but it was skimp!  Rice and beans were decent.\n\nService was great and the prices were actually pretty good!  The food was kind of skimp and bland though and I don't think I will be racing to come back.  There are other Mexican spots in Surprise that I want try out before coming back here.
