Pawn shops are a lot of fun to shop at, especially for jewelry.  This location is my favorite for looking for deals on jewelry.  It has one of the largest and best selection of jewelry in town.\n\nI like to come here at least every 2 or 3 months to see if there are any new pieces.  It can get really busy, so be patient.  It's best if you find a salesperson you like working with.  Over the years we've worked with a couple of people and one of them has my cell and will call me if an item of interest pops into the store....it's like having a personal shopping assistant.  Not too many people will do that for you.....she happens to do it because we've purchased a lot from her over the years and she works on commission....\n\nOverall, great place.....service is hit or miss.\n\nSome general tips.....\n\n- Don't bring too much cash.....for your own safety.\n\n- It gets very busy on holidays, but if you get there a week or two before a holiday like Christmas or Valentine's Day, you can find some good stuff.\n\n- Ask the salesperson if there's anything kept \"in the back\"......for instance, most good Rolex watches and other collectible time pieces are not out on display.....you might see one or two, but the best stuff is 'hidden\".\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
