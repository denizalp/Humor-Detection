Got a sneak peek at Harvest tonight and had to give it the credit it deserves. I'm that guy that needs a bite of everyones meal (sorry, germaphobes) and Harvest's menu is mostly built around sharable bites. Pretty cool how knowledgeable the staff is about the origin of the food even down to the farm it came from. Our server had some opening-night jitters, but it didn't discount the experience at all. If anything, it made things a bit more charming and comfortable knowing that everything about this place wasn't necessarily going to be a stuffy over-produced spectacle like many Strip restaurants. Possibly the most noticeable departure from standard \"Vegas\"  is the Dim Sum style 'Snack Wagon' that's constantly wandering through the restaurant. Some familiar tastes - plus a few for the more adventurous - it's a great way to try some new things without committing to a full meal. I'll leave a bit to the imagination, but all you need to know is get the Steak Tartare. You'll figure out the rest. \n\nA few highlights:\n\nSteak Tartare (in case you already forgot)\nBrussels Sprouts - these aren't the same ol' sprouts you've had 87 times\nDuck Confit Buns\nPotatoes Au Gratin - might look different than expected, but they taste better than expected\nPorchetta \nNaan Bread - I should be embarrassed that I ate multiple orders of this, but I'm not. ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯\n\nPersonally not a huge sweets person and Harvest has a nice selection of offerings; however (bonus!) they've got another cart waiting for you dessert fiends. People at our table were big fans of the Pear Tart, Homemade Marshmallows, and some sort of Chocolate Magic (no idea what it was called). \n\nCool, relaxed but still fun, sustainably sourced, and off the beaten path. Harvest is definitely worth checking out.
