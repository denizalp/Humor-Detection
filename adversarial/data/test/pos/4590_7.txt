First time visiting this place. It's very close to school and the staff are very friendly. The food was so good! I ordered the tripas burrito and the bacon wrapped jalape√±o. Very enjoyable. The location is within a little good court that serves hamburgers, wings, pizza and Korean food. I will most definitely be returning.
