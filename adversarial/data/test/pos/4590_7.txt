I feel sorry for this place after reading all of the single-star reviews. I originally would have given them a single-star since our first visit was taking my parents there for their \"First of the Month Free Senior Day.\" They host this every first day of the month. The selection was very meager, there were a lot of seniors (what did I expect?), and a whole lot of tourist coming off the tour buses. Since I thought this was an anomaly, I had to give them a second chance and I am very glad I did.\n\nThis place mainly serves tourists from the buses and local business is more-or-less a second thought, but don't let that deter you from coming. Also, since they mainly serve tourists, they are only opened for lunch till 2:30 daily. On everyday except the first of the month, they have a very wide selection of items (not as large as Buffet @ Asia) but satisfies my hunger (check the pics others have posted). We have been back 5 times in the past 2.5 months and enjoy every bit. The front staff and wait staff service is excellent and they always cleanup your dishes and check on drinks very often. And a big plus for me is that the place is very clean.\n\nTips:\n\n-Come for the \"Happy Hour\" M-F 11:30-12:30 @ $5.55 (approx.-I forget exact change). Did this on July 4th this year and they do not skimp on the selection for \"Happy Hour.\"\n\n-We mainly come on the weekends and the best time is to come after 11:30 (they serve 1 group of tourists for brunch before this and they start a new batch of items for the next group that comes after 12:30). Don't come during brunch because the item count is not as many as lunch.  I call this the \"Golden Hour\" because the place is pretty quiet during this time.\n\n-Get a Frequent Eater card. Every 11th meal is free. \n\nPrice: Local ID $10 and change and for Seniors $7 and change.\n\nUPDATE (11\/2\/14)-As of 10\/27\/14, they are no longer opened to the public with the exception of the first of every month. Seems like they just want to cater to their tourist business. Sad loss for us as it has been a favorite of ours.
