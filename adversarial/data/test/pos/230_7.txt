Like this bank location. Why?\n\n1. It's inside albertsons. I feel way safer coming in here and getting cash out from the ATM then going to the ones outside of the bank in which I get anxiety feeling unsafe. I'm in the bright light in what feels as a safe secure place.\n\n2. I can get my grocery shopping and bank needs done. Very easy to kill two birds with one stone.\n\nThe people seem nice. I've only dealt with them once and it was when I opened a savings account for my daughter. When I opened it, all I had to do was start it with 25 bucks and they made it super simple. They also give my daughter a huge horse as a thank you gift. She was in heaven. When I looked up the brand I saw it was a 40 dollar stuffed animal. Figured it would be less since it was free.
