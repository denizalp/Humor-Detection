This place is amazing!\n\nIt's very laid back in that there's paper on the tables and you eat your food from a bag.\nGreat if you want to hunker down with some one and watch each other eat like a true slob, I loved it!\n\nThey have a few different types of sauces; Cajun, garlic and house sauce which is a mixture of the two, and three levels of spicy; mild, medium and hot.\nWe ordered the mild for the wimp I was with and I got a side of medium.  Even the mild has a kick to it, maybe I'm a little wimpy too?\n\nOur bag had shrimp, crawfish and clams.  There were potatoes and a couple corn cobs in there as well.  We also got a side of hush puppies which were crispy and dark brown.  There were so many shrimp in that bag!  It was awesome, my lips were numb and fingertips red despite the gloves by the end of the meal.  \n\nThere's a small selection of beers, which go great with the spice.  You do have to make peace with making the bottle sticky between sips.\n\nNeedless to say, do not wear your finest when coming here.  I would say it's a great spot to loosen up if you're getting to know a person and whether or not they're uptight\/if they find you attractive with stuff on your face.
