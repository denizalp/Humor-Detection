When the moon hits your eye\nLike a big-a pizza pie\nThat's amore\nWhen the world seems to shine\nLike you've had too much wine\nThat's amore\n\nBells'll ring\nTing-a-ling-a-ling\nTing-a-ling-a-ling\nAnd you'll sing \"Vita bella - Basilico!\"\nHearts'll play\nTippi-tippi-tay\nTippi-tippi-tay\nLike a gay tarantella\n\nWhen the Lasagna make you drool\nJoost-a like pasta fazool\nThat's amore\n\nThis Bistro is located in an old Bungalow off of Vic Park and is a perfect Mom and Pop shop where everything is made fresh.  You know its going to be good when the owner\/chef watches me eat one of his peppers to see my reaction.  \n\nOne of the best lasagna in city, which is worth the drive here. \n\nNow THAT's AMORE!
