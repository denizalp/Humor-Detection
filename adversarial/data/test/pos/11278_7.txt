They definitely don't serve high quality fish. Not even decent.\nI came here and did the all you can eat which is 25 per person... there are other places that do all you can eat for cheaper and their quality is way way way better. It was pretty much empty save for one of the employees having lunch with a friend. That should've been a sign that this place was no bueno. Place was dead for a reason.\nTheir cooked rolls aren't impressive, very mediocre. Their raw fish are so obviously not fresh. I ordered tuna and hamichi nigiri and they served me something that looked so dry and the texture was parallel to a pencil eraser. As soon as I put that piece in my mouth, I spit it out and the waitress brought me more napkins lmao. I also ordered the tuna poke which had dry ass tuna mixed with lettuce. This poke was disgusting. I spit that out too. \nWe ordered steamed shumai and the crazy jalapeño. The shumai appeared to be the same ones you buy in the freezer section of an oriental market. It tastes like it had been in the freezer for years. The crazy jalapeño was unnecessarily huge and packed with a stick of cream cheese and spicy tuna. It was disgusting. I wasn't charged for the food I did not eat because I made it blatantly clear that the food they were serving us was inedible. But still, the bill was $60. I wasted $60 on crappy food and ate unworthy calories. Not coming back here.
