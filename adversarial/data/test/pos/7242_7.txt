I had been to Cantina 1511 once before and wasn't really impressed with that experience.  This experience was much better.  \n\nThis time I sat at the bar about 1 1\/2 hours before closing time.  I asked the bartender what they had in local beers - OMB's Copper on draft and Foothills Hoppyum in the bottle.  Ok.  This wasn't starting out well.  Do they know about the local craft beer craze?\n\nMoving on, I don't remember what I had the last time I was here so I asked the bartender what she would suggest and it was a pork taco where you make your tacos with the  toppings provided on the plate.  I asked if i substitute crunchy corn shells instead of the flour tortillas and she said I could do that.  This was a wonderful recommendation.  The flavors from these tacos danced in my mouth.  Also the best place for the beans and rice were on the taco.  People who have read my reviews know I am not a big beans and rice person because they often lack in flavor but not here. \n\nThe salsa was great here as well.  Just the right amount of heat.  The chips could have been better.  It appeared they were from out of a bag because all I received were broken pieces.\n\nBut overall, this was a great experience.
