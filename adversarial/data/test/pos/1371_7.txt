WORST SERVICE IN TEMPE!!!!! Like the WORST....\n\nHighly understaffed and rude to boot.\n\nFirst off all you'd have to be drunk to enjoy the awful food and since we are having trouble even ordering a drink it's just a miserable experience. \n\nI won't ever be returning to El Hefe for any reason. Even if they were giving away Tequila for free, I'd find another spot to drink. \n\nClearly they make lots of money and the management doesn't care for their customers. \n\nIn a town full of bars there's lots of other good choices to drink and spend your $$$\n\nDon't go to El Hefe!!!
