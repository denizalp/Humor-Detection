Zombie Zone is pretty cool in my eyes! My boyfriend and I popped in today and picked up a DVD of the original 1979 \"Dawn of the dead\" and a couple of Zombie stickers. This store is located near BFG chicken strips right next to the comic store  in the strip mall at Charleston and Rainbow. It is a small store however they have some cool things and the Owner stated they are constantly getting new stuff in. If you like horror and zombie related items then you will like this store.\n\nThey have DVDs, dolls, walking dead figures, posters, stickers, t-shirts, toys, candy etc.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I had a lot of fun looking around and talking with the Owner also picked up a few things. We will be back!
