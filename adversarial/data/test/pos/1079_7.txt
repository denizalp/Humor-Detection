I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and \"Small Business Saturday\" I thought \"why not give them another try\", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said \"Oh, I have another one in the box\" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said \"NOT cool at all\" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.  \n\nI felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.  \n\nI grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores.
