I am breaking my rule of not reviewing contemporaneously here.\n\nThe crew they sent sized up the job upon arrival and the foreman suggested that I cancel and he and his crew would come back the next day with their own truck and handle the move for less - I said no and called the company to let them know that their crews were profiteering on the side...big mistake.\n\nThis was the move from hell.\nThey busted stuff.\nThey stole stuff.\nThey were a complete nightmare.\n\nYou've been warned.
