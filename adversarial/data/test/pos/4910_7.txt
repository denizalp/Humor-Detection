We found this place on Yelp! Thanks for all the previous reviews! \n\nWe were greeted by friendly staff and we're seated. We had just enough time to study the menu. Then a smiling waitress took our order. After the order, we were served complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were very fresh yet not greasy. The Bulgogi Taco was amazing! I wish this restaurant was near my house... The Bulgogi Burrito was good, but after tasting the Taco, it just didn't message up. Don't get me wrong! It's really good... Just not as good as the Bulgogi Taco. The Kimchi fried rice was good too. But, I'll stick with the BULGOGI TACOS from now! \n\nI'll definitely be back!
