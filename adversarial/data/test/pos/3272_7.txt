I've dined here quite a few times with friends so this review is long overdue. Usually when I come it's packed and there's a short wait. I came yesterday later in the day around 1 and there was hardly anyone in there. So if you're coming early in the morning be prepared to wait for at least 15\/20 minutes. They have an awesome breakfast and lunch menu with really good options. I try something new every time. My first time here we had the chicken and waffles which were disappointing, the chicken was flavorless and the waffle was meh. My friend had the red velvet pancakes which were delicious though. I've had 3 of there egg Benedict's which I loved! The traditional was my favorite. The crab one was lacking something. The California Benedict was good not amazing though. I definitely recommend there skillets! We had a steak one with 3 sunny side eggs on top and man was that tasty! All of the skillets come with home fries (chopped potatoes) on the bottom. You have the option of egg whites or eggs prepared to whatever your liking is on top of the skillets. The service is always quick and friendly, I've never had a bad waiter or bad experience dining here. The only thing this place is missing is bottomless bloody Mary's and mimosas lol.
