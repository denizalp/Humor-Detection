If I had to guess the business plan for this decent size Chinese restaurant in the middle of the two-story building in Chinatown Plaza, I would have to guess: LA Chinatown buses to Las Vegas.  It certainly has the capacity to hosts 2 tour bus loads of customers, but is always empty each and every time I happened to walk through this building.\n\nOn a whim, I met up with another Yelper and had lunch here.  Their lunch specials are very affordable, with prices ranging from $5.95 to $6.95 covering 25 items.  You can practically eat here for lunch every day for a month and barely have to order something you have already tried.  That is actually pretty good.\n\nSo after looking over the menu we settled on the following items:\n\nFish Filet with Black Bean Sauce - Lunch Special. ($6.95)\nThere are plenty of fish in this dish, and although it did look like they skimped on the black bean sauce or gave us something different instead.  Either way, it was good and we had no problem killing it like it was your worst enemy that turned into one of those Walking Dead Zombies.  \n\nCabbage Green with Dried Shrimp - Lunch Special. ($5.95)\nA very simple and probably derivative of a very classical Chinese recipe, but still rather tasty.  It was not my favorite of the two items we ordered, but we still didn't leave any morsels behind for other bands of scavengers. \n\nBesides the wallet friendly lunch menu, their buy 1 get 1 free Thai Tea and Milk Tea promotion is very popular for people that happens to be walking about this building.  It is not the world's greatest drinks, but it is still an enticing offer.\n\nThey also serve Taiwanese Shaved Ice (the traditional shaved ice topped with various toppings (pick 3 items) and simple syrup and condensed milk ($5.35). If that is not your thing, they too have flavored smoothies and fresh fruit smoothies. That is a lot of items to refresh and satiate your sweet tooth.  \n\nReturn visit probability:  moderately high
