For fast food in the southeast this place takes the cake....or should I say shake!  The best food deal on the planet lies in the Cook Out Tray.  $4.25 to stuff your face.  One regular item (burger, dog, or chicken), two sides, and a drink.  The most ridiculous part of this is you can get chicken strips or a corn dog as a side.  Let me repeat, AS A SIDE!!!  \n\nAnd if you aren't full already after reading this, they have the best shakes in the business.  I just got done counting and they offer forty, yes FOUR ZERO, different shake options.  I'm drooling over my keyboard thinking about this place.  If I had a brain, I'd sell all my belongings and start a franchise up in Missouri.  They should start selling wheelchairs here, because people like me may need one after engaging in a meal at this magnificent establishment.  God Bless Cook Out!
