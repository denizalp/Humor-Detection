Do not EVER use their personal training service. The trainers are not qualified to oversee your physical fitness. I've been in the fitness industry for years and am shocked by my personal experience and others' stories. The gym is alright but do not listen nor waste your money on their personal training services!\n\nI went two weeks ago for the free session upon sign up. My trainer was patronizing, rude and didn't understand that surgeries require modification of exercises nor understood how muscle growth and fat loss are cannot happen simultaneously due to the biological requirements.\n\nNot too mention their sales tactics are pushy and are not looking out for your best interest!
