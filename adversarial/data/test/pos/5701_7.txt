This is the only true way to make an ice cream sandwich. Freshly baked cookies introduce a whole new realm of quality to a dessert that most people have only experienced in supermarket boxed form.\n\nHonestly, it really doesn't matter what you order. Just pick your favorite cookie and your favorite flavor. I don't think you can go wrong. Cookies and ice cream go together like white people and craft beer.  \n\nWe've only visited once and were quite pleased. Due to its location, we haven't returned, but plan to very soon.\n\nThe question remains: Is it really only two dollars? In present day? At a time when ice cream shops charge premium prices simply because the foodie crowd is willing to pay for it? Indeed it is!\n\nI just hope it stays this way.
