Okay I did not get lost between Venetian and Palazzo for twenty minutes to find such a random small stand under the escalator! \n\nYes, the macarons are delicious, but dayum it is expensive! Back home, i can get it for $1.65 for the same size and im already flipping tables! After purchasing one for $3.50 ..I'm ready to go to the gym, build some muscles, and come back and flip the entire stand.\n\nBut I have to admit, it was pretty good. The butter cream was nice and moist and the outer layer was a mixture of crunchy but yet soft. I got the pistachio macarons and boy oh boy ..melted inside my mouth and I was literally in heaven! \n\n\nCan't visit this place all the time.. Or else I'll become bankrupt.... And overweight
