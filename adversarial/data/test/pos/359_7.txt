Solid meh. Long story short neither my husband nor I would return. \n\nWe came for brunch and it wasn't good. We were seated quickly but sat for about 20 minutes before I flagged down a waitress and begged her for coffee and water. Our waitress came over a little bit afterwards to tell us she'll help us soon and disappeared. When she emerged we ordered but she wandered away again so another waitress helped us most of the time when I would beg her for help. The restaurant wasn't full so I think we just got the wrong waitress. I hope our waitress shared her tip with the other waitress because she was our only help. \n\nAs for the food it took forever. We were hoping that meant the food was amazing. My husband liked it but I ate the toast and about 2 bites before I was over it. I didn't like the sausage. The egg whites were good but they didn't have hot sauce for me to spice up the health food. I had to order something that was under their \"healthy\" designation of 700 calories. \n\nI miss the restaurant that was here when it was The Hotel. I'm not a fan of Dellas.
