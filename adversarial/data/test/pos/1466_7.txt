I really don't know why the ratings for this place is so high. The line is ridiculously long and slow. Unless you are willing to pay the bouncer some $$$ be ready to wait at least an hour in line. I don't mind waiting in line, but once I was in it was a complete sausage fest. The ratio was so messed up omg it was like 10 guys to 1 girl on a Friday night. The positive thing, it is a nice big club and I like the outdoor area to chill.
