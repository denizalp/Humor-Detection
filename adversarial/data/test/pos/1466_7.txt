Downtown is definitely the place for a vegan restaurant! Love the indoor garden, creates a great ambiance. Menu has a lot of variety, may be hard to choose what you want: apps, salads, pizzas, and various ethnic entrees, plus juices. \n\nMY LITTLE DUMPLING: steamed Shiitake and spinach dumplings. Easily some of the best dumplings I've had, stunningly good quality. They were clearly fresh and handmade, with ample filling, and a tasty dipping sauce to boot. But $6 for a portion of 5 just-bigger-than-bite-size bits was steep.\nDOWNTOWN TONY: Trio of portabella sliders with kale and sriracha aioli. Pretty good execution, good choice of mini brioche buns, but the aioli was so sparingly applied it seemed to be on there for color rather than flavor. Dish is plated with some simple potato fries and a house-made ketchup. Again, good quality!\n\nDishes are flavorful but sophisticated, with a  price tag to match. Solo lunch above was a hair below $20 with tip. Service was polite and attentive, really love the way they've styled the space! I'll come back to try their vegan sushi and bao.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star. As happy as I am to have vegan options in Vegas, this place is inconsistent. Most recent visit was sorely lacking in both food quality (boring, simple dishes) and service (inattentive, lack of knowledge when we had questions about specific dishes).
