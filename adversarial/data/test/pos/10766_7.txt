This is my fav casino! It's definitely a locals spot and their casino is relatively small compared to the ones on the strip but that is what I like most about it! They have tons of slots with the latest games and a good selection of table games (again not a huge area).  The comps here are pretty great in comparison to other casinos I have been to and you can use your points to pay for food. There is a AMC movie theater inside the casino if you need to take a little break from gambling. Hehe \n\nAs far as the rooms are concerned... What I like most about the rooms is each room comes with a mini fridge so you can bring your own drinks. There is only one smoking floor which is floor 8.  While they tried to revamp the rooms and hallways a bit... Let's be honest; it's still really dated. There is a beautiful golf view on one side but it tends to be a little more expensive. \n\nFor food they have a sports bar, Briggs oyster grill (which I recommend); the bagel cafe (open 24 hours) but they often run out of product late at night, subway (usually closes at 12am); and cafe sienna(yuck!). \n\nLast note make sure you get your  B Connected card before you play. They often have multipliers (7x, 11x) on reels... Rack up those points and receive some comps!
