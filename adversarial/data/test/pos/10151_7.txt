We've visited Antico a couple of times, and what will keep us returning is their delicious food.  Just be prepared to wait a bit for your food, as their kitchen is small, and everything is made to order.  \n\nWe've tried their pizza, fettuccini alfredo with shrimp, gnocchi sorrentino, and capelllini al pesto with shrimp.  We've enjoyed everything we've tried, but the fettuccini alfredo was slightly over sauced.  (I'm sure I could request less cream sauce the next time.)  My favorite dish thus far is the capellini al pesto - it's a truly exceptional dish!  Their shrimp are absolutely huge, and cooked perfectly.  Prices are really reasonable for the sizes.  Portions are big enough for leftovers, too.  \n\nI do think service could use a slight improvement.  While our servers have been very friendly, and communicated well when the kitchen was behind, they weren't as attentive when it came to refilling our drinks while we waited, providing pasta spoons with our dinners, or providing bags for our leftovers.  Those are just little things that could have made our visits truly great.  \n\nRegardless, this is a new restaurant, and I'm sure service will continue to improve over time to match the outstanding food.
