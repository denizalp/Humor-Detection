The TTMA, as an experience, is growing on me. You could feel the guitar sorcery in the air on this October night. \n\nAnd I have to hand it to the venue for taking a chance and holding a concert featuring the triple decker heavy metal slamwich of Clutch, Children of Bodom, and Black Label Society, especially so late in the year on an evening where the wind had a little bit of bite to it. Brrr.\n\nDespite the weather, I had so much headbangin', chimerical axe-slingin', breeze-punchin', mallochio-throwin' fun, I got away with wearing only a band t-shirt and jeans. \n\nYou only get chilled if you stand still with your arms folded.
