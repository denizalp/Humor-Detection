We decided to stay at Mandalay Bay because of the shark reef, lazy river and beach pool but this was by far the biggest mistake! \n\n#1) Arrived Saturday afternoon and after a long drive we had to wait 45 mins to check in! I guess no one planned ahead and hire additional staff. Please don't give me... \"it's a holiday weekend\" \n\n#2) first night and the hallway smells like weed! The smell lingered into our room! Mine you we have kids!\n\n#3) beach pool was pretty cool but BEWARE $25 per tube for lazy river, $75 for shaded umbrella + $75 for each lounge chair. Are you kidding me?????\n\n#4) came back from dinner and our room smells like WEED. Gave me a headache the whole night! Since we are leaving in the morning I didn't bother. With all that we've seen, there is really no point. \n\nMandalay may be affordable but so not worth it!!!! Pay the extra few hundred for a better hotel in the middle of the strip where everything is walking distance. The TAXI line is beyond ridiculous. I would not recommend Mandalay to anyone. Do your homework before staying here!
