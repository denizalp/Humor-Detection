Stopped in for their grand opening, in which they were giving away ALL of their food for free! My wife and I ordered the #1, #2 and #3, which were the hummus plate, fattoush salad and a falafel plate, respectively. We also got a side of small french fries.\n\nHummus was a nice big size and tasty, although it only comes with one piece of pita bread and could definitely use more (we had to go up and request an additional pita bread).\n\nThe Fattoush salad was delish! Great combo of veggies\/toasted pita chips & dressing.\n\nThe falafel plate was also tasty. It included 5 or so flattened falafel balls, each with a squirt of tahini on top. I really liked this dish and this says a lot, as I'm a picky customer when it comes to falafel. Many places fry their falafel too much or do something else strange where they turn out dark and overfried. Those types tend to upset my stomach, but not the falafel from Good Fellas! It was good stuff.\n\nI do have a few suggestions for improvement. \nI'd like to see a veggie combo full meal plate, as all the veggie items mentioned above are just appetizers. \nI'd like to be able to order a side of rice, but their rice contains a chicken base, so it's not an option for us. \nNo dolmas\/dolmades? Whassup with that. \nThe falafel plate has a TON of lettuce & tomato under it, but no dressing. Would like to see a dressing or side of dressing offered for that.\nWould also love to see a vegan soup offered.
