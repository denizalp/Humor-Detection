Skip the Foundation Room and come here!\n\nViews of 3 sides of the Strip and an awesome, swanky vibe. Went there late on a Saturday night and loved the band that was playing. We sat on plush couches with tons of pillows and - imagine this - we could listen to music AND talk to each other! In a Vegas lounge! Woohoo!\n\nSure the drinks are pricey but you're paying for the view and the experience. Love!
