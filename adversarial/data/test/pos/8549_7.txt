I know first thought Spaghetty not Spaghetti?? Huh?? Okay maybe just corky gimmick too get you walk in the door or meant too help restaurant stand out from the crowd?? No matter the case one thing you will find is good food, great service, affordable prices, and  small business owner that cares about customers from minute walk in. Bonus if urge too take some fresh parmesan cut from block, deli cuts, or even fresh dessert serve by the piece too go Spaghetty Western has you covered all ways Italian.\n\nThe restaurant set up like standard deli restaurant. Not many tables but also bar stool area that can eat on. The menu have paper menu look at and also computerized version too look at hanging from at the wall. Sneaky but make sure check the specials of the day on chalkboard off too the side. They do great job of explaining the specials that day if you miss it. \n\nI ordered the Spaghetty Western since carb loading for 50miler bike ride next day. So thinking heavy pasta dish with protein and pasta. The Spaghetty Western is solid choice. The spaghetty (believe fresh tasted like too me) combine with the sausage, pancetta, and peas really nice light tomato sauce was awesome. Not heavy loaded with pure chunks of tomato or too think that not much of sauce. It had the right balance. The pancetta and sausage could eat by itself! Sure would order anything with either one of those meats on the menu. It came with order of garlic bread. It not often would rage about garlic bread comes with you entree. Garlic Bread showed me much they care about the little things even though comes with my entree. Two pieces had nice spread of butter, garlic, and chopped parley. Besides it came out HOT crispy garlic bread. The portion size was great not too mention very affordable. \n\nThe only negative comment would say is that stack of dirty plates that sitting on table next too me the whole time. Not sure if lack of staff cause small business. Still nothing that would stop me from coming back for more pasta or trying more of the menu. The desserts all look great and definitely yelpers rave about. I make sure leave room next time. If in the area in need of solid Italian food not going break the bank need too stop in and no worries about the corny name. Never judge book by its cover my friends...
