LOL! \nWe took my in-laws......eeeek! I did not read these reviews prior........\n\nNaw, they were good sports and thought it was funny and for \"the couple who has seen almost every show EVER on the Strip\"....... \nBelieve me they had NEVER experienced anything like this show. All four of us loved it.\n\nI honestly can say I can not contribute any other information or funnies to these amazing reviews...other than to read some of these...lol after you have seen this show they will make you smile all over again. I did :)\n\nI will say if you are tall like us...be glad...sorry if you were behind us...we were in row two.   :)
