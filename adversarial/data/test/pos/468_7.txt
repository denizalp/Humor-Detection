True, this place is not shining like the top of the  Chrysler building. However, it is an inexpensive buffet,so you cannot have it all.                    The hostess is always eating when you come in and she is never happy. Everyone else there is great!  They have a huge selection of food here,lots of seafood as well. Your drink comes with the meal and they put out a lot of coupons. So even better. Plenty of parking and lots of seating.
