A breakdown of my experience of Gus's Diner:\n\n+ Cute, shiny exterior with lots of glittery, chrome goodness inside to match...\n- ... but overall some extra stuff piled up in weird places and looked a little worn, especially on the counter side\n+ Super friendly staff\n+ Great music appropriate to the theme\n+ In-booth mini jukeboxes...\n- ...that don't work. The coin slots are all taped over. Boooooooo. \n+ Inexpensive\n+ Root beer malts, a thing I haven't seen since going to Pinocchio's in Racine as a kid\n+ The option of an old-school turkey dinner served on white bread and covered in turkey gravy...\n- ...where the turkey ended up being a slab of equally old-school processed turkey loaf instead of carved turkey breast\n- My meal came with soup - I went for the BLT soup out of curiosity and it was a cheesy base with halved cherry tomatoes and what appeared to be pieces of cabbage? It was actually surprisingly tasty, cabbage\/lettuce\/mystery leaves and all. \n\nOverall the food seemed to fall a little more to the processed\/Sysco side of the spectrum. I don't think I'll probably need to eat here again, but I might make my way back to give them root beer malt a try because I am having some serious nostalgia for one. It's hard to go wrong listening to oldies and sipping on a malt.
