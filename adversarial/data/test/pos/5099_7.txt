Shops at Don Missing: This place looks like it was opened somewhat prematurely. There are a number of empty store fronts. And of course the down economy was probably a nail biter for the mall's investors.  It's reminiscent of the outdoor mall concept popular on the west coast, like Seattle's U Village and the Redmond Town Center. While the aforementioned malls are both decidedly positioned for middle classed consumers, the Shops at Don MIssing seems positioned to be upscale.\n\nThe mall is, after all, a short jaunt from the uber tony Bridle Path neighborhood, which hosts the cribs of some of Canada's most prestigous imprisoned captains of industry like Conrad Black. So I guess the mall is really meant to cater to their needs, not a desk drone like me.\n\nStill I'm no stranger to upscale shopping and can window shop with the best of 'em. And... well.. I dunno. Nothing here made me wish my income was doubled. It could use a couple more coffee shops. There is a Starbucks but it might be nice if there was a Timonthy's or Second Cup.
