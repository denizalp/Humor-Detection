This bar is a jaw opener. The minute you walk towards it and see is enormity youre in awe. It has three levels of bars all within a ginormous chandelier. With a variety of seating options and arrangements its a great place to mingle. We went in to check it out and have a drink. As we approached the bar the bartenders were on point acknowledging us immediately even though they couldn't attend to us right away. When he did he kind of asked what we liked and gave us some suggestions. Their drinks are very unique in name and the way they're made. I stuck by the cosmopolitan (since this bar is inside the Cosmopolitan hotel). Whoa! It was delicious! a mixture of sweet\/flowery with the alcohol. Like nothing I've ever tasted in a cosmopolitan before. I truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the overall look of the place. It's definitely a must go to when you visit Vegas.
