This was perhaps an anomalous day, because it was Good Friday, and that means the crowd was large.  And the crowd was 40% dogs, and 50% babies.  Which isn't really my kind of crowd.  Seating was really limited, and we had to stand for an hour before getting a seat.\n\nThe beer is nice, but no sour beer, which is my favourite at the moment.  Staff is very friendly and really awesome, so they have that going for them for sure.  \n\nThe food situation was really sad.  The \"pop up\" the day we went was VEGAN HOT DOGS.  Ok, I'll give it a shot...they were awful.  I don't want to dock marks from henderson's because \"sausage party\" was basically the biggest rip-off in the history of food pop-ups, but I think they need to screen their choices better.  It almost made me not want to go back to Henderson's, which is not fair to the brewery.
