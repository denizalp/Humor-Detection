Cheat day was upon us and Italian was on my mind. To be more specific, truffle chicken carbonara and cheesy garlic bread were the two items I wished magically appeared on every menu late night. \n\nWell, that's hopeful wishing. To even find an Italian restaurant open at midnight is another struggle. We came across bootleggers through yelp! Open 24\/7?! Sold! Although No cheesy garlic bread and no truffle chicken carbonara...So I settled with chicken Alfredo and complimentary garlic knots. \n\nAlfredo was pretty good! I wish it was more saucey! Please don't be shy on that Alfredo juice, no one ever complained about their pasta being too saucey, and if they did, they're a fool. Garlic knots tasted stale. But who cares. You can't complain about free stuff. That's just begging and choosing. So of course we ate it all!! Happily..... \n\nEnvironment wasn't rude but it wasn't friendly. Our server did his job, and made sure we got everything we needed and at an appropriate time. Very straight shoot \"get you in, get you out\" type of service. I wasn't upset about it. \n\n\nSoooo Long story short, that's how I felt about bootleggers Italian food at midnight. I craved. I came. I ate. I left. Wish I could say more than this but it's all I got for now
