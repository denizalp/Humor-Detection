the clarendon has one of the best happy hour restaurants we've eaten in. great fish tacos!\n\nwe spent our new years eve hosted by the clarendon. it was very inexpensive, at only 25 bucks. they hosted a Gatsby theme and luckily, most everyone showed up dressed to the 9's!\n\nthe party was held at their pool lounge area which had plenty of heat lamps and lots of room to move. or you could head up to their roof top patio which has amazing city views. there were heat lamps also. \n\ncash bar and a DJ for the party. it was nice to be able to move about so freely without constantly bumping into other party goers. \n\na couple of things to consider: the rooftop patio is floored with wooden planks with gaps in them. didn't bother me, but i noticed several women in their high heels get caught up several times in the gaps. \nthe DJ was ok i guess, but i did not care for his music. only towards midnight did people start dancing and he didn't interact with the crowd at all. all of a sudden, we just hear \"10, 9, 8,....\" and that was it. \nlastly, the wine pours. very inconsistent. i believe a drink is 5oz, but the bartender only served us 3oz. later that night, i got a completely full glass. good for me?\n\nbut that's nitpicking. fun night and lots of taxis lined up outside to take you home!
