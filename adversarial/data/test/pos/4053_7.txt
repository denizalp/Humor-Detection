They are one day away from their First Friday 'hard' opening and this is the best they could do? Fifteen bucks for a burger and fries I've happily paid many times at many places, but here? Not so happy.\n\nI was warned they have gotten off to a horrid start, but didn't want to believe that precious Scottsdale place can't figure out hipster downtown Phoenix.\n\nI called when I got out of the Jeff Speck talk over by City Hall and got hung up on in the middle of asking whether they do takeout.\n\nSo I rode my bike there anyway to find out how supremely busy they must have been on a glorious Thursday night to hang up on a takeout order.  6 tables out of 22+ have guests, dealt with by two wait staff, with two other staff wandering around and two cooks on duty.\n\nTwo strikes already - but wait! It's goes on! The cashier was too busy to even speak with me for about 4 minutes. I never could figure out what she was doing.\n\nSo I ordered a cheeseburger from this \"French Bakery\" - note that is IS NOT a \"Boulangerie\" - with fries to go. She just looked at me and said \"is that all?\". I said \"yes\" and she looked disappointed. After a few seconds, she asked \"Don't you want bacon and mushrooms?\". I thought maybe saying \"yes: might get the order processed. I was right. So I asked how long it would take. Was told \"10 minutes\". Which seemed slightly quick, even though nothing was being cooked in that moment.\n\nSo I came back 10 minutes later and sat around for 5 minutes, eventually noticing two little boxes over by the cashier, who was chatting away at another employee. So I waited 60 seconds before going over to find out whether the little boxes were my order. She stopped chatting long enough to put the boxes in a bag and hand the bag to me.\n\nI've seen greasy spoon short order cooks fork a par-cooked hunk of meat out of some liquid slop and slap it on a grill. This burger tasted like that. I noticed a few little squiggles of something that could have been mushrooms, and a few flakes of something that could have been bacon bits.\n\nI only had to bike 4 blocks home. The food was luke warm. At least the fries taste better lukewarm than McDonalds fries do.\n\nBut that re heated burger - not good. It does something to the texture of the meat.\n\nThere is serious competition in downtown Phoenix now. This place is not ready to succeed here.
