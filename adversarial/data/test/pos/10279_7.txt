Damn! One of the better places I've tried in awhile!  I love the idea of Japanese tapas. The flavor combinations are genius and unique! \n\nStarted off with a fusion of barley tea\/yuzu (non alcoholic) and it was tart, but tasty! \n\nUdon fries animal style, perfectly crispy and adorned with that addicting sauce!  My friends got the fried oysters and really enjoyed that.  Chicken karaage was pretty standard.  Our table favorite was the blue crab and asparagus!\n\nFor dessert, we tried the affogato and the toast.  The spin on the adffogato was the crunchy chocolate and coffee jelly.  The toast was amazing! It had anko, camembert, and a maple drizzle (that you squeeze yourself!). I would order the toast again!!\n\nThis place is meant for adults. We brought our kids, but it was difficult with the high top tables.  There is also seating at the bar.  Service was spot on and knowledgeable of the menu. Our server made great suggestions!
