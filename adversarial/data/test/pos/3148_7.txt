Finally a coffee shop in South end! \n\nI walked over here the other day from my house, and I'm just so excited to have something so close! We are so happy to have Central Coffee in South End. \n\nI love the wooden bar they are making the coffee behind. It's beautiful! The space itself is an amazing location, but it doesn't feel as homey as I would like. They have nice chairs and tables, but again just not the atmosphere I would want to spend hours working in. \n\nIt's nice they have a separate room for when you need it to be extra quiet or for an event space. \n\nI ordered a vanilla latte and it was very good, as expected. I was very happy to see their list of baked goods! I always want coffee shops to have food and they do! My favorite is their zucchini bread. However, it was placed in the fridge and wrapped in saran wrap. The condensation made the bread soggy, which was a bit of a disappointment. \n\nI will be a frequent customer because of the prime location. Central coffee is one of the best coffee shops in Charlotte. Welcome to South End! Y'all are already busy! The future is bright for y'all!
