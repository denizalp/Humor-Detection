Located inside the Orleans Hotel\/Casino. We had lunch here we each ordered a dish to share I got the honey walnut shrimp which was yummy. We also got chicken broccoli, vegetable fried rice and chow mein all dishes were yummy. The service was pretty quick and staff was friendly. Overall very good tasty food here I would recommend coming here. I'd come again.
