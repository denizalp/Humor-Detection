My boyfriend really wanted to come to hard rock to check out the memorabilia and such. We figured we'd gable and drink (the usual in Vegas) we didn't think too much on the food.\n\nI checked yelp (duh) and saw some really well rated spots, but this one stood out because we love oysters! \n\nFood and drink;\n\nOysters (5 stars) - amazing and the waiters were so well informed! I told them we liked Kumamotos and they gave us some similar ones that I forgot the name of which were fantastic. \n\nPan roast (5 stars) - I don't like fish I don't like seafood in soups and I don't like tomato based soups lol. All signs point to my boyfriend picked this out for us to share and I went with it. Good thing! This stuff is awesome! Definitely more than enough for two of you get rice with it. \n\nComplimentary salt and vinegar chips (5 stars) - If they'd bag these id eat them everyday. They were a thing of perfection.\n\nFried fish (5 stars) - a little compliment from the chef after we talked with him and my bf explained how he hates heavily battered fried fish. He proved to us his was excellent and not over battered at all! Super flavorful, and flaky. Can't say enough good things about this stuff. \n\nMoscow mule (5 stars) - I had 3. Not because I needed 3 but because they were the best damn mules ever! \n\nThis should be a Vegas must try for anyone who likes seafood because the selections here are superb and the chefs know their sh*t!
