My first review of 2017 and I'm going to make it a memorable one!!!!\n\nWe decided that we were going to have our baby delivered at St. Rose Siena since the hospital is an 8 minute drive from our house. We've heard good stories from friends who've been to St. Rose for various reasons and they all had good experiences as well. Registering before my due date was super easy and the registration staff was very friendly. \n\nThe time finally came where my water broke at 5 am and we made the quick drive up the street. While I'm not going to go into details of my son's birth, let's just say the nurses and my Dr. made everything as soothing as they possibly could. All the maternity ward nurses were caring and made me feel like I was a member of their own family. We could tell that they really loved their jobs. \n\nI've been to different hospitals in the past and I must say that St. Rose's hospital food was by far the best I've had. I'm not saying it's 5 star dining, just saying it was better than what I've had in the past. They even brought us a celebration lunch for my BF and I that included steak, shrimp, fettuccini alfredo, cheesecake and a special congratulations cake. That was very sweet. \n\nAll the other people that came into our room during our 3 day stay were very friendly as well. From lactation, to billing, to photography, to housekeeping, everyone was very warm and caring. The facility was very clean\/sterile and our room was comfortable and spacious enough. \n\nIf you are considering hospitals, I would definitely recommend St. Rose.
