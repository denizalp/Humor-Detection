Expensive, very expensive.\nShitty, very shitty.\n\nPre-frozen, thaw, heat and serve, institutional, no flavor burgers and fry's.\nMalts were lame and tasteless too.\n\nPretty lousy place to spend your money,, and they know it. It's ridiculous.\nTheir customer base are business people with expense accounts that need something located in the hotel, so their heart isn't in it.\n\nIt's just a 5 minute walk to Gordon Ramsays pub across at Ceasars or Gordons BURger that are much, much better quality, atmosphere and service, and less money.\n\nKenny's Gourmet Burgers is a shit hole with crappy food and service. Kenny is a joke of a \"chef\" if he thinks this is good.\n\nThe high rated reviews are from restaurant staff and investors.
