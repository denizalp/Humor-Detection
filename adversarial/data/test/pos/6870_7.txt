It's been years since I've stayed at a Courtyard, but geez have they stepped up their game. \n\nThe circumstances of our trip to Toronto weren't the best, but we were in need of a room to stay for a night and luckily this one courtyard caught our eye in terms of location and price point. Upon pulling up I did notice a flew planes flying in and out as it's not too far from the airport, but when we settled in no issues of it being loud at all from the inbound and outbound planes. The overall feel of this one is very modern and sleek and almost nothing what I remember Courtyard hotels to look like. The King bedroom we booked wasn't a huge room, but the layout and the way they structured the room made it feel spacious Amenities here included an indoor pool, a gym, and feel wifi. Pool looked nice as you could see it from the lobby elevators and although I didn't get a chance to make it to the gym from the pictures it seemed just as modern and sleek as the rest of the hotel. Downstairs lobby bar also functioned as a coffee shop and casual restaurant. And there was a very small mini mart to pick up and snacks and beverages you might need. Parking was free and seemed to be enough for the hotel. In terms of location, easily less than a 30 minute drive without traffic to downtown Toronto. Hotel is situated right across the way from a shopping plaza that has a grocery and several options to eat at. \n\nAnyways, all in all a great spot to stay at for a night. The only thing I could probably complain about is no complimentary breakfast. Boo. But overall, a great stay.\n\n'Til next time, cheers!
