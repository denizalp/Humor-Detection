Now it appears you can come into the bar and save as many tables as you'd like during happy hour with tons of children. But, if you're there to have dinner and a couple of drinks (alcohol) you should come earlier (then 6 PM) to avoid the family hour in the bar or eat at a later hour, say 8 or 9 o'clock. Now that I got that out...Ally (5 stars) an awesome server, who has assisted us before, was able to get us a booth near the bar. Will we come back...yes. But beware in the Northwest Valley there is a movement hitting the eating\/drinking establishments out here...families. And one other thing...it's September and the snowbirds are coming too!!!
