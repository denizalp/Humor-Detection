Great place to catch a game & enjoy a cold beer.. my bf says the beer is always cold here .. \n\nOn our most recent visit we sat at the bar to catch a game .. beers were cold, my jack & diets never went empty.. \n\nOn Sunday's I recommend the wings & sliders special .. the wings are crispy and perfectly done, the sliders are nicely seasoned and are the perfect meat to bun ratio .. \n\nThe burgers come with a thick meat patty and are served on buttered buns (sometimes sour dough bread).. lots of options ... I had the blue cheese and thin sliced crispy onions and it was huge and delicious.\n\nPlenty of indoor and outdoor seating.. lots of tvs for sports watching, check the front entrance & menu for drink and happy hour specials .. \n\nWe'll definitely be back!
