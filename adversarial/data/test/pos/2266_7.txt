I will never patronize this restaurant ever again!  My friends and I have been treated rudely by the vallet staff.  When I complained to the on duty Manager his smug response was so arrogantly delivered, basically a \"too bad so sad...not our emplyees\" that it was the first time in a very long time I actually was going to use profanity towards someone!!!  I have filed a complaint with Mayors Office.\n\nI will eat Sheetz hot dogs off of the sidewalk, in my underwear, before I ever set foot in that restaurant again!
