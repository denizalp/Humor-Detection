I once stumbled in to this place on a frigid winter evening in Aught Seven, looking for directions to a Roller Derby tournament that was taking place nearby. They gave me the wrong directions, but I made a mental note to come back and try their brew (if I survived the swirling blizzard!).\n\nFast forward to 2011 and not only do I get to try their potions, I also get to see how they craft them! The environment is friendly and unassuming. Our tour host was awesome, really knew what he was taking about and didn't hesitate to say that on a night out with his wife he'd still order Wild Rose beer. I've been a longtime fan of their Wraspberry Ale, but drinking it straight from the source has now spoiled me for buying it anywhere else. You have to try it from WRB. Or plunk down 90 bones and fill up a Party Pig so you can pull yourself a pint straight from your own fridge. Is having your own keg excessive? Maybe. Am I filled to the brim with Wild Rose Propaganda? Definitely :D. *waves hands* You will not buy cheap beer anymore. Ooooooo.\n\nOh, and the food here is good too! Must come back another time to try out their veggie chili. This time I won't wait another 4+ years.
