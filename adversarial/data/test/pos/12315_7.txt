Service was okay, and the food was good. Where my problem started was the bill. There were two others at my table and the waiter brings us one check. I ask him if we could get separate checks and he tells us that he their machine won't let him do separate checks. Okay so we figure out the math ourselves and tell him to charge this much on this card and this much on that card etc. I also gave him a visa gift card that was activated and everything. He comes back multiple times it got declined and there's no way to accept gift cards! The waiter also charged my debit card to the ring bill! I mean c'mon! So ridiculous! Not going back!
