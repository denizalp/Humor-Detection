Gorgeous bartender and tasty drinks!\n\nGot the 17 oz. Vegas Crush to start, barely tasted anything, but it was a good fruity combination so I got the Wake Up Call next which was pretty much a coffee frapp with alcohol in it.  Although I still didn't taste the alcohol in it this time!  And my wife watched the girl pour about 4 inches of Jameson in, I guess next time I'll have to get a triple shot.  Although i think it may have just hit me late, either that, or the full belly I had from Sugar Factory and the 2 drinks I had were fighting each other in an epic battle of my insides. \n\nI dunno.  \n\nNot a bad deal considering you can get a refill if you just stay sober enough to be able to hold onto your cup, either that or just find one that says Evening Call on the side.  I recommend keeping your own cup, who knows what cooties other people have.
