This is my third time of visiting Mark and Anthony Salon, and the vague sense of dissatisfaction I'd gotten on previous visits was only highlighted on this 5 hour visit. \n\nI have a weave install of Bohyme Brazilian Wave. I had worn it for five weeks curly and wavy, and I wanted to try the straight look. I arrived right before 1pm last Friday. As soon as I sat down, I told my stylist, Char, that she needed to detangle, twist into four, and then shampoo in sections, twisting each section as soon as it's done because it tangles otherwise. The first process of detangling went okay. But then Char promptly ignored my direction to wash in sections and then tossed me in the dryer for 25 minutes for \"conditioning\" with my hair all in one messy ball. Of course it came out even more tangled. \n\nAt this point, she had to detangle it again. Pro: she enlisted the help of the shampoo girl. Con: they both proceeded to tell me that my high quality hair could not be 100% human hair, and was I sure, and was it cheap hair, because it should not need such care. I had been specific about the care needed, the direction had been ignored, and now the quality of the hair was being called into question. \n\nAfter detangling, Char had me sit aside for 20 minutes because her 3pm appointment needed attention. I said nothing. Eventually the shampoo girl came, twisted the hair as I had previously instructed, and then put me in the drier for the conrrows to dry. The subsequent blow dry and flat ironing went okay, with Char stopping to tack down two small corners where the weave was coming off while grudginly admitting that the hair looked really good and was actually quality. She suggested a trim. I agreed. \n\nI finally was ready to go home at 6.30pm. I was exhausted, and a 2.5 hour job had been unnecessarily prolonged and my time wasted because instructions were ignored; and my hair had been insulted. Insult turned into injury when I was presented with the bill $95 for a wash and flat iron. The breakdown was: \n$60 for shampoo set \n$15 for trim\n$10 for press\/curl (Why is this diff from shampoo set?)\n$10 for weave (sewing down has always been part of weave maintenance, and she literally did 3 minutes of sewing total). \n\nI was irritated, but decided not to argue. I tipped 26% to show it's not about the money, but I will NOT be going back to Mark and Anthony Hair Salon. I'm much better driving out somewhere not so convenient where they'll listen to instructions and not extort money from the customer to make up for time that they caused to be wasted in the first place.
