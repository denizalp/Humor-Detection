What I love about Le Reve is that the female acrobats featured in the show are on equal footing, talent wise, with the male acrobats. In most of the Vegas shows I've seen featuring acrobatic stunts, women are usually treated as adornments and don't usually partake in any acrobatic feats. I tip my hat to the badass women of Le Reve.\n\nLe Reve is NOT a Cirque show, but it definitely will appeal to the same crowd. It's a little over an hour and 15 minutes and is based on a very loose plot revolving around love and a woman's dream. Tickets are $100+, but there are discounts for locals, military, and AAA members. \nPRO TIP: It's not worth it to shell out the extra dough for upgraded seating options since the intimate sized 360 theater makes it impossible to have a bad seat. VIP seats are on the very top row, but in my opinion, the best seats in the house are the ones closest to the stage. On my most recent visit, I sat in the 3rd row. I got splashed with specks of water maybe 2 times, but the viewing experience was unreal! \n\nMy favorite parts of the show were of course, the acrobatic feats. Performers dropped from insane heights and dropped into the pools below. Acrobats gracefully flew around and did Olympic worthy flips into the water. Some acts reminded me of God of War (because of the dramatic music and pale bald male performers - only gamers will understand this reference lol). I could have done without the Dancing with the Stars tidbits and synchronized swimming, though. Other favorites were a \"firework\" show, a fountain show that rivaled the Bellagio's, and fires being lit on top of the water.   \nCOOL FACT: Le Reve is one of the few shows that actually allows you to take photos during the show. No flash or recording though!\n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nLe Reve changes every six months so it'll be a little different each time you go. I've seen Le Reve twice and noticed only minimal differences with the second showing. I can't comment on the value of the tickets since I seen the show for free, so keep that in mind. Overall though, I think Le Reve is a great Vegas show.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #104
