Best. Meal. Of. My. Life.\n\nI only give Shibuya four stars because of the price, but - let's be honest - it is worth it and then some. The ambiance and service was top notch, but the meal was - hands down - the best of my life. My friends and I were audibly moaning with pleasure. It was borderline inappropriate how much we loved our meal and I'm sure our neighbors were wishing they had chosen another table.\n\nYes, Shibuya is pricey, but try the tasting menu and die happy.
