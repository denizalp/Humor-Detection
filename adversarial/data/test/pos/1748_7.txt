The best thing about Lee's is that its open 24 hours. They have a large menu, so there's plenty to choose from...\nSandwiches, che(viet desserts), smoothies, coffee, eggrolls, pok buns, and etc...\n\nFast casual spot. You won't be served here so don't expect that. \n\nThey're are located in a busy plaza of Chinatown so parking might be difficult during the the dinner rush. \nThey only accept cash, which is ridiculous. There is an ATM on the side of the restaurant, but to have to pull out money from an ATM and pay a fee for a 3 dollar sandwich upsets me and most probably. \n\nGreat place for a quick snack in Chinatown. Might not be the best place for Vietnamese sandwiches in Vegas, but they are so convenient that I don't see them going anywhere anytime soon. It's upsetting because I'm from San Jose and grew up on Lee's Sandwiches, and this just doesn't cut it.\n\nTheir cafe sua da is amazing. They put way too much ice in it so you might want to wait til it melts a bit...pretty thick otherwise.
