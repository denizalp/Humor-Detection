I would like to pin another 5 star review on the the lapel of Flowerama of America. Being inside this tiny flower shop is a dandy , and a delight. Flowerama is an oasis that sale flowers but also they sale lovely plants and greenery. They also sale throws with inspirational messages and stones with inspirational messages printed on them.\n\nOn my last visit here which was in the spring I purchased my very first croton this is a tropical plant that can be grown indoors. When I got him he was just a tiny little guy with four small green leaves in a 4in pot.  I am proud to report today that my croton now lives  in an 8in pot and has something  seven  strong and healthy leaves that are orange, ruby, yellow and green.\n\nThe shop keeps are very sweet and engage in pleasant conversation with their patrons and knowledgeable about plant care. In the short amount of time I was in the store from listening to their conversation they seem very passionate about their business.  I saw one employee making a rather grand looking arrangement right behind the register. \n\nWhen the weather breaks I think I'll go back for another house plant.
