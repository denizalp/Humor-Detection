First, the margarita deal via Groupon was a rip-off. They come out of a frozen drink machine, not hand made by any bartender! And very sugary with hardly any alcohol in them. Like a 7-11 slurpee! I ended up giving it away to someone in the street! The bummer was it took forever to even FIND the place -- walking in circles for almost an 45 minutes! With Venetian staff having NO clue where it was either. And the security guard had an idea but note: the Food Court (where it is) is NOT the same as restaurant row! So after 45 minutes of walking in circles ALL I wanted in the world was to down a huge margarita and it didn't happen. Next, the service....barely existed. The girls were not exactly friendly or welcoming, it was a bit disorganized and slow. Lastly, and their saving grace to not getting 1 star...is the food was surprisingly pretty good! We got burritos bowls -- one meat and one tofu! That was a plus, being a vegetarian, yay! there was something I could eat. It's NOT Chipotle but the food is good...definitely overpriced tho. Therefore, IF you find it, don't fall for margarita deal just get food...or save yourself, relax & sit down and eat at one of the many awesome restaurants in Venetian, not here.
