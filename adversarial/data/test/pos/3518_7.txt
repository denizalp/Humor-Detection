Beautiful furniture but A. You will pay a high price for it...it is high-quality furniture for sure and furniture that was costly to begin with, but even her consignment price is on the high side. So if you are looking for a reasonably priced piece (one that the average person deems reasonable), you likely will not find it here. And B. It is true that the owner has attitude with those she doesn't maybe deem worthy or who rub her the wrong way. I have received the same cold and actually rude reception. I'm old school and believe in a warm and friendly welcome by staff for all potential customers...not just those who are well dressed, carrying a Gucci bag, or someone who has either consigned w her before or who buys often and buys her higher priced pieces. If you want a down to earth greeting and prices more reasonable, check out other places in the airpark.
