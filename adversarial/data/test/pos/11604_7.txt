I am not a standard chicken and waffles fan.  From where I came, chicken and waffles did not have fried chicken.  Rather, the chicken was stewed and the meat was added to the gravy made from the stew juice.  I generally avoid chicken and waffles because of that cultural divide.\n\nI read about Bruxie when the Park was being built and I read about their menu.  It's been bookmarked for almost a year now.  Before the Cirque show at the T-Mobile Arena, I decided to give Bruxie a try.\n\nI looked at the menu and ended up ordering the Nashville style hot chicken waffle.  The menu describes the sandwich this way--Spicy & Smoky Fried Chicken Thigh, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Lettuce, Pickles.  I also ordered an iced tea.\n\nI was given a buzzer and told to sit anywhere I wanted.  They'd bring the food to me when it was ready.  I put the buzzer on the table and went to the area where you get napkins, cutlery, and sweetener.  One of the women brought my tea and said I could have a refill if I wanted.  Shortly after, the woman brought me the metal mini-tray with a cardboard in the bottom for liquids.  I cut the waffle in half and then proceeded to enjoy it.  The waffle was soft with just a small amount of crust.  As I was finishing the second part of the sandwich, the waffle had lost all firmness and it just melted into the food.\n\nAs long as I was here, I decided to do it all.  I ordered a dessert waffle and it was a toss up between two but I decided on the Nutella and banana.  It was a bit smaller than the sandwich waffle.  The Nutella was spread on the waffle and then sliced banana was added.  This was good.\n\nBruxie gives you a fast food option in the area that's different.  I enjoyed my food there.  I would recommend they turn the music down about 20 decibels.  It would have been difficult to carry on a conversation with the loudness of the music.\n\nI might come back and try something else here.  I like the concept.
