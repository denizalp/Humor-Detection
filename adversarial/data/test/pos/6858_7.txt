This week the hubby and I have been trying to experience a different coffee shop every morning based on Yelp reviews and the area that we'll be in. This was my pick. \n\nI ordered a double con panna (my head was still spinning hours after). The baristas were awesome but what I found fascinating was at one point in our visit a man went behind the counter, helped himself to a pumpkin scone and told the barista that he was giving it to a homeless man. He also asked for an espresso drink saying that he'd make it himself but he was busy, carrying a baby. I'm assuming that he was the owner? If not, maybe I can go behind the counter too? Nah.\n\nThis is definitely a cool little coffee shop. They have a latte of the week; this week was the Valencia Mocha (no clue what that is though). They also roast their own beans.\n\nThey have a loyalty card, and dogs are welcome. Several regulars came in as the barista greeted them by name or asked if they wanted their usual.\n\nThere is a big area for outside seating and ample indoor, plus free wi-fi (ask for the password).\n\nThe mix of clientele made it a very comfortable place and the coffee was excellent.
