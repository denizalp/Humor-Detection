We come here for a slice of sushi and a slice of 'American Chinese' food. Driving around with a mad sushi craving is never a good thing, but with the Yelp deal, this place will hit the spot. The rolls aren't madly inventive or the ambience isn't the next Charlotte hot spot either. But. Last time, their version of General Tso's was surprisingly good, but should be expectedly fresh during a slower weeknight. The sushi rolls weren't small either, and I'm perfectly fine with having some good basics without the trendy $10+ rolls where it takes up three line items to describe what it is. \n\nThe service isn't top notch as the servers seem young and\/or inexperienced, but I typically don't ask for much else besides the food here.
