Came here to celebrate my late mother's birthday and I'm sad to say that the quality has really gone downhill. I added the seafood option (used a coupon from a local ticket booth dropping price from $50 to $30) and for $30 it was ok at best. There is a better seafood spot here in Texas (See my Tokyo One review). The service was outstanding as well as the Prime Rib. For $50 I would've expected better quality (not quantity) of items. The lobster tails were a joke as well as the cold crab legs. It is time to celebrate a new tradition elsewhere.
