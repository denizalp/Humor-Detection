Being Persian and having been fortunate enough to have both lived in Iran and traveled there extensively, I know what good kabob should taste like, and unfortunately, Gilaneh does NOT serve it. \n\nI asked my family in Toronto to take Dr. Dad and I out for the best kabob money can buy. For some strange reason, Gilaneh was what they chose, and now, thanks to this horrible decision, methinks my family hates me. While the hot noon-e-barbari they serve on wooden slabs as starters with fresh sabzi is nice, nice is not what I come for. Any good Persian will tell you that hot noon and sabzi should be accompanied by 1 thing - paneer (cheese) - and Gilaneh totes dropped the ball on this. Instead, they send weird pre-packaged butter from Costco which goes well with NOTHING. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered everything from the traditional mast-o-khiar and mast-o-mooseer to the more unique baghala-ghatogh and mirza-ghasemi. When we arrived, they were out of haleem bademjoon but offered us grilled bademjoon instead. As far as the mast-o-khiar and mast-o-mooseer, they were both more sour cream heavy than they were mast, and while I use sour cream in addition to mast when I make it at home, there's was just too much. The baghala-ghatogh was served in a cute mini ghablameh (pot) which was its only redeeming factor. Otherwise, it was runny and flavorless, and the poached egg was far too overcooked when we had specified we wanted it runny. The mirza-ghasemi and grilled bademjoon were barely memorable so I won't even waste my time writing about them. \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered everything on their kabob list. Their shish-lix (lamb chops) were way overdone - charred and tough. You couldn't even cut through them with the knife provided and I was afraid if I risked just biting in, I would lose a tooth or two. The kabob kubideh, which is my Dr. Dad's all time favorite, was dry and completely falling apart. I've NEVER experienced brittle kubideh before this experience and I hope to never encounter it again because it was horrid. The kabob barg was also rather tough - I'm not sure if they marinade their barg before grilling it, but something was just off. The joojeh was thin and more or less meh - no flavor and they didn't even bother throwing a piece of lime next to it on the plate so I could squeeze it and give it my own flavor. \n\nAll in all, if you are craving kabob, and lack the necessary physical body parts to make your own, I say avoid this place like the plague. If you aren't a kabob connoisseur though, feel free to check Gilaneh out. I'm pretty sure even you will be able to tell that something just isn't right. \n\nP.S. they totes screwed up their homemade doogh. My gold standard for kabobi's is their homemade doogh, and Gilaneh's doesn't even qualify as gold-plated. le sigh.
