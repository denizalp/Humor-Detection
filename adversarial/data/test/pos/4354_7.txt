The good: free wifi, local calls, the clubs here are great\nThe pools are also very good and upbeat, although I have been here as a guest at the pool on busy weekends and it was way too crowded. But still one of the best in LV.\n\nThe bad: The Nove Italiano restaurant is really good...the rest of the spots to eat are schmeh. If u've never stayed here the location is on the other side of the freeway from all the other hotels...so it is quite a walk (in 100+ degrees) to get to the other spots..they do offer a complimentary shuttle, but it only runs until 8pm.\nThe rooms are a little dated, and are clean but don't have that wow factor. \n\nThe ugly: The frigging valet here sucks so bad. Idk if it is the layout, the employees, or what...but it takes a damn eternity to get into and out of this place, also takes forever to get a cab here. Frustrating.\n\nAll in all, it is hard to rate this place...I was gonna give it 2 stars but then realized I was comparing it to the more posh spots in LV...this is more for a younger crowd, who doesnt spend alot of time in the room, and doesnt care that much about in hotel dining options.
