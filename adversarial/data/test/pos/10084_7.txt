OKAY I know I'm from Japan so I have high expectations for sushi, BUT that also means I've eaten at every other sushi restaurant in Vegas so I know what's \"good\" for Vegas and also what's bad. Well, I thought I knew what was considered bad, but I really didn't until I tried Blue Fin. I've had better sushi rolls from the grocery store deli. And the nigiri? I won't even talk about that because it was on another level of bad. \nBaked green mussels: I've never seen mussels served this way. Mussels are the umbrella term for a groups of molluscs that have a common shell. A common SHELL. The mussels here weren't in their shells!!!!!! They were served in an egg carton like plate with the meat de-shelled and placed in each cup with 5x the amount of sauce melted on top of the teeny tiny piece of meat. I felt like I was eating spoonfuls of sriracha and mayo with a topping of mussel. \nRolls: As a 5 person party we ordered a lot of rolls. The rice was dry in every roll and the seaweed had that wet but tough consistency where you had to eat each piece of the roll whole or else you wouldn't be able to tear through it with your teeth. Oh, and the raw fish was like that too. Rubbery and difficult to tear with your teeth. Yuck. I tried to stick to cooked rolls after that, but it wasn't much better. \nAll sushi restaurants have that \"if you leave sushi on your plate we'll charge you,\" clause on their menus, but that has never been an issue for me until Blue Fin. There were a couple of pieces of nigiri that were so bad no one in our 5 person group could finish it. We had 4 pieces left on our table and the waiter instructed us that they would not clear our plates until we finished it and if we didn't they would charge us. I understand that AYCE sushi restaurants need to have rules like this, but the nigiri was so bad there was no way any of us could finish it. Sorry we wasted those 4 pieces of very low quality fish you purchased. \nThere was no one Japanese working in the restaurant....... But I think that goes without saying. ;) I wanted to tell everyone eating at the restaurant that what they were eating was NOT sushi. Please don't come here and think this is what we eat in Japan! It hurts me to think that people think this is Japanese food :(
