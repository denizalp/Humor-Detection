One of the best restaurant experiences I have had so far.\n\nThe restaurant is very small, classy, and upscale. The design is exquisite, detailed and very colorful. Attention is paid to all details of the dinning experience starting for the plate presentation to personnel interactions.\n\nThe atmosphere is quite, intimate, and relaxing. There is a spectacular glimpse of Bellagio fountains show form the windows. \n\nThe menu is set up in pre-set tasting menus. The food was amazing, especially the deserts of chocolate ball and crème brûlée.\n\nPrice is expensive, but well worth it.
