What an awful service! \nDo yourself a favor & read the contract thoroughly before using them! It's BS! \n1st They (Katie) wouldn't return my emails, then finally made the appointment & received a msg the day of asking if they could come 4 hours early- um no. Also after filling out their required online forms, somehow they didn't have my phone number or address & never asked for the forms! There were 2 girls who showed up, Katie & her assistant. After washing my dog, she was left sitting in the tub wet & shaking until I finally said something. Also while she handled my other dog, she let him choke himself to the point I had to jump into the van & loosen the collar they had put on him. The other 1 dropped my dog and he ran back in the house. I had to cut the service short (they did 1 dogs nails, ears & bath & my other dog a bath-If you can call it that) Their own website states that for $25 the dogs get a bath, anal glands checked, a detailed brush out, and a bandana or bow. They used MY dog shampoo, didn't clip his nails or dry him & dropped him! but still charged me full price @ $25\/ dog! Not to mention how traumatized he was after. Then they threw in a HIDDEN service fee of $15 (clever way of ensuring a tip?!) I guess you need to charge shady service fees when you know you're a FUGAZI \nNVR AGAIN ~ SO UNPROFESSIONAL \nI actually did tip the assistant $5 but I felt like they shouldn't have charged me for my dog that they hardly serviced. No nails No anal glands, No teeth, No Nothing! All they did was get him wet with my shampoo - didn't dry him but for those 3-5 minutes charged me $25 \nI should've trusted my instincts not to use them as soon as Katie was so rude in her emails & on the phone - she can fake being nice in person but not her lack of professionalism. lotsa luck ladies
