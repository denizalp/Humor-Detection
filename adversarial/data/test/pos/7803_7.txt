The Home Depot on W. 117 \/ Berea Rd. is bizzare. I should bump it up a star for being so weird inside, but it really does kind of suck.\n\nI really don't know why I'm reviewing this place, it just popped into my mind and I began to think about how strange it is. I think it's because when you first walk in you see a lot of people, but where you start to really become aware of the surroundings about 20 paces in, it becomes a bit of a twilight zone.\n\nI'm always looking for weird sized nuts and bolts for various things and I never get any help, so I bring what I'm looking for usually. If you're looking for an employee - forget it, better chance of me flying to the goddamn moon than finding a useful employee here. The key making stand is usually abandon, the lights\/lighting section looks more like a modern art display because NOBODY is ever there and the psychedelic layout all on it's own is kind of interesting. Every time you're looking for an employee they're rounding the corner of an aisle to escape you or they pretend like they don't work there. I've had people come up to me and ask for help, and I'm not wearing any orange.\n\nIt's strange, you'd think middle aged dad's and wasted Cleveland bar dudes would really step up to a job like Home Depot. They work on their deck all summer, fix shit at home and get stoked, and like to trick out their floors with nice tiles and stuff - but nobody here seems real psyched to be working. You'd think all the dudes would be like Hank Hill or Tim Taylor from Home Improvement - ready to assist in anyway, or perhaps even getting into optimal tiki torches to keep bugs away for your next summer patio rager. No dice.\n\nI don't really know much about handyman stuff, but the place is pretty deserted so it's fun to walk around and pretend that I do. I'll get deep into the wood zone and pretend I'm thinking deeply about which ply to choose, or pretend I can actually afford a shed and walk around in one of those. Or sometimes I'll just look at electrical stuff like I actually have the knowledge of how to install a light fixture without zapping myself Clark Griswold style. I can't do any of those things, however it's fun to walk around the place because it's pretty isolated and calming.\n\nThis review doesn't seem that bad, but when you leave and exit out of the post-apocalyptic parking lot you kind of think to yourself that that place sucks and that the hardware stores you used to go when you were a kid were a lot cooler.
