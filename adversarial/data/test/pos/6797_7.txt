After hitting Grapes on Shea and Scottsdale for happy hour today- review coming shortly (maybe... hey, I've 12 other reviews that need to be written!), I headed to Sweet Republic for a sweet ending.  I'd received a newsletter from SR that there were new flavors in honor of Valentine's Day, and I thought what a great reason to pay SR another visit!\nOf the two Valentine specials, Raspberry White Chocolate and White Roses, I could only sample the latter, as the former contained an allergen.  I'm a sucker for floral-scented food and drink, and this SR delight was a winner!  I could definitely taste roses, and the sweet cream wasn't too sweet.  Loved it!  I also sampled Desert Honey (a tart yogurt sweetened w\/ local AZ wild desert honey), Almond Buttercrunch, Salted Butter Caramel, Cheese Course Duo, Espresso, and Mango Lassi.  I took a pint of White Roses and Desert Honey ($7.50) and a scoop of Salted Butter Caramel to-go and a scoop of Almond Buttercrunch in a waffle cone (2 scoops $4.25 + $1 for waffle cone) to savor!  I couldn't pass up a Chocolate Chip Walnut Oatmeal cookie ($3) as it looked so delicious on its cake display stand- one of the proprietors, Helen, offered to warm it up in the microwave.  What a wonderful suggestion!  I asked if she could tear off a section and warm it up...  The warmed bite I took at the store was amazingly good!  (I did notice that the rest of the soft-batch cookie, sampled in the car, was definitely saltier than I'd wish for in a cookie.  Why didn't I detect this saltiness in the warmed-up section?  Perhaps the sweetness of the almond buttercrunch made my tastebuds more sensitive to salt?  Hmm...)\n\nI really enjoyed the almond buttercrunch and the cone, so much so that I wished I'd skipped on the salted butter caramel- heresy some fans of this flavor might think, but what can I say?  I loved extra textural component, and the buttery toffee-sweet crunch, that the almonds provided.  I may be back, maybe as soon as tomorrow!, to re-visit the espresso and the mango lassi (and grab a few more of those chocolate chip walnut cookies!).  ;)\n\np.s.  Couldn't resist and just had to taste a couple scoopfuls of desert honey and white roses before placing the pint in the freezer... Oh. My. God!  Run to SR before Valentine's Day is over and White Roses disappear from the rotation!  (Just remember to bring your credit card- a visit could get expensive!)
