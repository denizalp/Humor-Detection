The staff was friendly at first but as soon as you speak your opinion about something they all turn rude. For example my son had homework todo and needed to use the computer... We walked up to the club house and there was a sign saying that the club house was closed... I went into the office and said could you please put a sign up that gives us at least a days notice so that we could plan accordingly... The rental agent started bobbing her head back and forth being very rude so I walked away and a manger comes running after me yelling across the apartment complex that I was being rude and to stay away from the office... I'm telling you that the office sticks together and think that they are never in the wrong... DONT MOVE HER I REPEAT DONT MOVE HERE!! I have lived in other Camden complex and they are great but these people or just completely RUDE!!
