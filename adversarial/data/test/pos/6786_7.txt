Zinc Brasserie had a French ambiance, but it's bright with matching decor and a wall of windows. French music. English speaking staff. Bar drinks, food, gluten-free dessert and coffee books for reading pleasure. \n\nAnyways, the prices are great. Excellent menu with just enough choices. I couldn't resist the frites, but actually not hungry. So they packed me for the airplane. The chocolate brioche bread pudding was amazingly good. \n\nLoved it!\n\nBesides Zinc Brasserie being in the airport, they advertise two other restaurants around Phonenix. I highly recommend them: alone or with others.
