Located inside the Complexe Desjardins, MBCo (Montreal Bread Company) is a Canadian chain of boulangeries. The menu is one typical of French cafes, centered mainly around coffee, pastries, sandwiches and eggs. Beers (i.e. Coronas) and other alcoholic beverages are also available at this location. \n\nSeeing that I didn't want to pay the Hyatt hotel another $22 a head for a lukewarm buffet, my boyfriend and I wandered here one Sunday morning. I ordered a Portabello mushroom sandwich, stuffed with chevre, spinach and braised leeks ($7.99), trying hard not to lick up the garlic-infused mayonnaise on the side. I was so enamored with my sandwich, I totally forgot to try my boyfriend's breakfast (muesli and yogurt, meh)! \n\nEven though the sandwich was sufficient for breakfast, my eyes had landed on the fruit tarts near the cash machine as we were paying for our meal. I couldn't resist and am glad that I had one! It was perfect in every way - delicate, sweet and fresh. The only regret that I have is not ordered a dozen to take back home with us. \n\nSigh.\n\nJust being in Montreal is a constant reminder of our inadequate our bakeries are in Toronto.  Will someone please open up an MBCo. in Ontario!?\n\nCORRECTION: There are two MBCos in Toronto!
