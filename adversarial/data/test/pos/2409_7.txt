I LOVE @Rubios_BeachMex . REAL grilled steak tacos and 4 great salsa to choose from.\n\nThis visit I was redeeming my Birthday Email for a $7 Entree!!\n\nI ordered the 2 Steak Taco plate with Chips & Beans!\n\nFantastic. Friendly Service.  I had intended to take it to go but it smelled so good I had to tear into it right away.\n\nI would have given 5 stars except the nearest location is in BFE:(\n\nDon;t forget to sign up for the Beach Club to get YOUR Free Stuff!:-)
