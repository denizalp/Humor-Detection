Glass and steel and spanky nice with the free coffee but that doesn't hide the fact that it's just like any other car dealer whether it's GM, Ford, or Hyundai.  Was looking to get a trade; the guy low balled and then sent his typical sales manager to say \"we could give you an extra $__\".  Suffice to say, I knew I was getting hosed.  Went to a bunch of other dealers and got 30% more.  +ives: nice decor but I'd rather visit the ROM; -ives: just like most dealers but they wear nicer suits.
