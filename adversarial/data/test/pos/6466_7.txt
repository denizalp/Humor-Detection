We arrived to Las Vegas around a awkward time so we decided to do a quick happy hour to get some food in our system. \nI stayed at Planet Hollywood so it was a quick walk next door to get to Hexx.\nTheir happy hour deals are great and the food is yummy! \nI ordered a crab cake and a spinach dip!\n\nCrab cake:\nDelicious and they did not skimp out on the crab meat! Every bite was satisfying!\n\nSpinach dip:\nThe dip was LOADED was spinach and artichoke. The cheese pull was mesmerizing ! \n\nService is remarkably awesome, the staffs are so friendly and nice! I definitely will be back! \nThank you Hexx!
