If I could give this place 0 stars i would. Came here one night with some friends and the service was absolutely terrible. Granted they were kind of slammed which is an excuse to be inattentive to an extent.... instead they were just plain rude. The bartender, dont know her name but she looked to be about 30 was increased rude. She asked me what i wanted to drink in which during my 3 second pause she walked away and asked someone else the same thing. It took her 5-10 to come back. A lady sat down next to me and asked for a light beer for her husband (clearly knew nothing about beer brands) the waitress laughed at her asking her how she didnt even know what she wanted. I will never come back. Service is almost everything and it was terrible. Remember the people who walk through your doors keep you in business. You guys are awful.
