Oooooooooooooooooooooookay, okay, okay, people. CALM DOWN. I get that Six is cool and everything, and Jessie is great and all, but can we please take ONE MINUTE to talk about LINDSAY, the receptionist?\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that for the record, I have been here three times over the last 6 months, and all encounters both inside Exotix for work and outside (when I have questions regarding aftercare or jewelry quotes), have been 100% excellent due to Lindsay. She is super polite and has been so stellar when it comes to answering any questions I've had regarding aftercare, and also getting quotes for me regarding jewelry, She has kept me in the loop about what's going on or the process behind jewelry quotes, even if she doesn't have an answer right away regarding what I'm asking for. Did I mention that her response time is excellent? Lindsay has been a blessing to  me throughout my experiences with Exotix. They are so lucky to have her (and I am so lucky to have met her), and if you ever get a chance to meet her, make sure you let her know that you feel the same. \n\nNow back to reviews on the piercers, hmm...\n\nI actually have 3 piercings from Exotix. I came here three times, and each time have walked out with something new. I have a daith done by Jessie, and a helix\/outer conch AND an inner conch done by Six. They, too, are excellent piercers - very fun and social, and definitely know how to make you relax through the piercing experience. I highly recommended ANYONE you know to get their piercing work done here. A few times, I have also brought a friend with me to get piercings done also, who also informed me that he felt that Exotix was the best place he has ever been to in his life. \n\nI've had the pleasure of getting some BVLA jewelry through Exotix as well (currently ordered - thanks Lindsay!), which I am super stoked about. They have many options for high quality jewelry, as well, to facilitate your healing. The cost of the actual piercing are OK - some say it's a little on the high side. I'll be honest, in comparison to other places, I don't really notice a difference as it's so minor (5-10 bucks maybe?). You truly get your money's worth in all aspects, though. Knowing that, it doesn't warrant any complaints. The piercings are done well (EXCELLENT placement), minimally invasive and not super painful (just a tiny pinch). Even with aftercare, I haven't had any issues due to piercing placement, and have received many compliments on my piercings, even by others who oppose or don't like piercings, in general.\n\nRegarding the facility:\nIt's SO clean. The decor is modern, and yet classy. Note that the office is on the 2nd floor ABOVE the restaurant at the same address. Appointments are welcomed, though not necessary. I find from my experience, it helps to make one, especially if you're looking to have multiple things done in one go. It'll help keep you organized to remember all that needs to be done, while making the most of your appointment.\n\nAll in all, I would never let another studio pierce my body. MY ONLY two regrets regarding Exotix are 1) that I didn't find this place sooner and 2) that I'm currently running out of money because I actually want more stuff done.
