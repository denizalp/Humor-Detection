Considering Fox Concepts seem to engulf a massive chunk of Biltmore Fashion's restaurant space, it was only a matter of time before we'd finally pay a visit to Blanco Tacos. In short, it's pretty much what I expected. Slightly above average tacos served in a sleekly decorated setting, but not quite good enough to where I feel it's worth a revisit.\n\nWe ordered a variety of tacos to sample, including the carne asada, BBQ, carnitas, and roasted chicken. Nothing was really bad, but nothing really stood out as something mind-blowingly delicious. You have the option of either flour or corn tortillas. Both work fine.\n\nAs for sides, the butter-infused rice tasted great at first, as most things with butter always do. But after several bites, I had no desire to keep eating. The butter flavor should be more restrained, providing more of a subtle compliment rather than completely dominating the rice. The street corn suffers from a similar issue. The first few bites are the most enjoyable, until you can barely finish the remainder of the dish due to mayonnaise overload. The beans, on the other hand, were a stark contrast, as we couldn't really taste much flavor in them.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Mexican Chocolate Cake. Although I maintain that it would work much better as a sponge texture, it was still decent in its harder form. The subtle hints of cinnamon and salt were both nice additions. With a scoop of ice cream, you can't really complain, although I'll probably forget I even ordered it within a few weeks.  \n\nOur server was polite and the service itself was good. No issues with food quality. I'm sure if you're an entry-level taco fan or love margaritas, it'll do just fine for a gathering or date. But in a place like Phoenix that has such a heavy Hispanic culture, there's far too many other options to rely on Blanco as a go-to taco spot.
