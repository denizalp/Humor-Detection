The place is great, like the other st-Hubert! The staff was accommodating. The decor of this one is nice and modern. \n\nIt's a go to place if you want traditional style chicken. It's not the quality of Ramados nor Cyrano on st-Viateur, but the quality is there and is always there. Kinda expensive tho... for what it is. I would go there for business or with big family reunion, but if you are alone with your girlfriend, think agin...
