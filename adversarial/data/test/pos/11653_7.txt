I've put off writing a review of Taj for a few months because, dang, the staff was SO kind and nice. I just couldn't say mean things.\n\nBut dang if this isn't the dullest Indian food in town.\n\nI'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! But, DAY-UNG.\n\nWe had the buffet and sat in a very pretty booth with light and elegant (and elephant!) art on the walls. No paneer whatsoever was on the buffet, which happens sometimes and is disappointing but fine, but I heard one of the staff explain to a customer that they didn't offer any cheese dishes on the buffet because people wouldn't pay higher price they'd have to charge.\n\nWhat? How do the other Indian restaurants do it? (I won't name names, but if you're already on the east side of I-15, there's a well known and Yelp-adored Indian restaurant that has made a point to always serve a paneer dish on buffet, and not just the same old sag paneer, either.)\n\nI see the restaurant is highly rated by many others, and I'm genuinely happy for those diners and the restaurant alike, but my plate of miserable chickpeas and other tasteless vegetables (when Indian food is normally outstanding for vegetarians) said otherwise. Believe me, I'd LOVE to have a reason to visit this shopping center more often (as it's also the home of the super-fun Popped), but what I tasted was so dull that at least four other Indian restaurants in this valley would have to go out of business before I'd give Taj another chance.\n\nMaybe it's better if you order off the menu? Or if you are timid about Indian food? Or if you haven't had a wide variety of Indian food? Or if you're unwilling to leave Henderson? Or if you aren't a vegetarian? (My husband would disagree, but maybe his just-as-tasteless experience was a one-off?) I don't know. I guess I just wanted to break my silence and say, listen, if Taj Palace ends up being your first Indian dining experience and you don't like it, please don't write off the cuisine until you give somewhere else a chance. I've had more zing! and finesse come out of a foil packet.
