This place is like a blank canvas for you to paint your evening on. You really get out of it what you put into it. In and of itself, this place is just an average bar. It's kinda neat and it kinda has a theme and the layout is kinda good enough for you to kinda be able to wander around looking for your friends, a hookup or a fight. \n\nA few facts: \nI've been here several times, and it's never been apeshit busy. \nI never had to wait in line to get in. \nIf there is ever a line here, I just keep on moving. \nI typically find a decent place to sit. \nI've never met anyone here that I would want to continue to know beyond that. \nI've always come here with a group of people, and it was never my idea to go.\n\nI tend not to drink when I come here, but I think about the only thing I've had here is an Appletini years ago - also the only place I've ever had one of those. They put a little thin apple slice on top and I thought that was the coolest thing. I found out later just how not special that was - and that I was about one Appletini away from getting a boyfriend and matching fanny packs. So funny the idea that a drink can \"make you gay\" - like it's a magic potion or witches brew or something. Honestly, I don't know anyone who drinks those anymore - gay or straight. As a rule, I don't drink any martinis anymore - I just detest the shape of the namesake glasses they come in.\n\nBut I digress... I've had some decent times here, but still these days I'll go out of my way to not go here. The only compelling reason to come here would be me and the company I bring - and I'd rather take my friends somewhere cooler. Devil's is a bit of a meet market and the atmosphere does lend itself to scamming, so if that's what you're looking for...\n\nI do hear about fights happening here quite a bit - a good friend of mine got blitzed here one night and almost got into a fight with another patron - took his shirt off, threw his arms out and bobbed his head even - he ended up punching a cop instead and wound up going to prison. Good times.
