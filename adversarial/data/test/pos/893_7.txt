This is a great place to chill with friends even if you just meet them inside.   The atmosphere is relaxed and the seating is designed for groups by only having page wood picnic tables that seat about 8.\n\nWe've gone for their bingo-trivia night and it is so much fun.  He has invented a great way of mixing bingo with music trivia. Everything from name that tune to name the show from a snippet of the theme song. \n\nThe dj keeps track of everyone's points by name and you can purchase process based on the amount of points you have to spend, don't have enough to get what you want... no worries come back next week and add to your total from last week. \n\nI didn't give it 5 stars because the drink selection is definitely for a particular taste. Also every time I've went their was only one bartender.
