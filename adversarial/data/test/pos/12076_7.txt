Wandered around NYNY and Monte Carlo - all around the new T Mobile arena park area.  It is a great area to hang out and people watch, grab a bite to eat and just chill.  Best time to go(esp in summer) is evening.  \n\nHope to attend a game at the arena or a concert at the Park concert hall soon.  There are some cool art pieces(see pic).   As you can see, I really tried to cover up my female friend but only succeeded marginally!!!!
