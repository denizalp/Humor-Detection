The worst. Walked in and they didn't have me in the system because I signed up online. Wasn't offered a shirt to begin with. Cancelled less than 10 days after I started because we are moving and they will not give me a refund after the payment was taken yesterday. Called the gym to have a conversation about this and Shaun was more than rude. Asked to speak to management and he let me know he was management and he would be doing nothing but let me know that the payments would no longer be taken now that I've cancelled my membership. Because that was clearly new news to me.
