This place is AWESOME. Is it Korean owned? A lot of workers were speaking Korean when I went there and that only adds to its awesomeness. Lol We ordered the Crab Fried Rice, The Pineapple Seafood Fried Rice, and the Screaming O Salad to go. It was all delicious but the Crab Fried Rice was really something else! It was exceptionally good with big chunks of real crab. I can't wait to come back and order that again and try some of their other menu items. Their sushi rolls looked really good too! \n\nAlso, is really nice inside if you decide to dine in!
