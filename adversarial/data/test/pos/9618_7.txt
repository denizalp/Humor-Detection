If youre a collector with deep pockets you will enjoy shopping here. Dresden from Germany, Lladro from Spain, etc.  The Ivory, and Italian sculptures will set you back hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The salesman was very kind to show us an Italian \"Last Dinner\" sculpture for only $38,000. I may have to peek in my attic, I'm sure I have some little nicknack statue I bought at a yard sale thats actually a Dresden! Anyway,  it's worth a looksy if you're in the shops at Paris\/Bally Casino!
