Both Yelp and the door say they open at 9am.  The girl opening up today did not arrive until 9:05 to open the door and then spent 10 minutes setting everything up before even acknowledging me in the store.  One customer left because she was not ready to start business for the day.\nWhen she was finally ready she was very short and rude acting like I was bothering here.  Another worker showed up around 9:10, never said a word just started helping her open.\nIf you want repeat customers, employees should be ready and be a little more polite to customers.\n\nAs for the food, the coffee was good. A Carmel Macchiato.  I also ordered a veggie crepe which is just tomatoes, pesto, mozzarella and basil.\n\nThe crepe itself had no taste, if not for the inside it would have been bland.  I would rate the food 3 stars, and maybe even given an overall 4 stars if not for the lack of customer service and customer interaction.\n\nTeaching moment:  things happen, if you are running behind, still greet the customer with a smile, have some fun with the fact you are running late and let the customer know it will be a minute.  That goes a long way versus acting like we are bothering you.
