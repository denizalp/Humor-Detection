I love the Encore and I love XS. It's glamorous, boasts big headliners, gets super crowded but not obscene. The crowd here is young and fun and I love that they have indoor and outdoor area by the pool. They play mostly EDM, some hip hop occasionally. It was and still is my favorite Vegas club.\n\nDrinks are ridiculous, and I'm subtracting a star for the $16 shot of Grey Goose I took on Friday night that was warm.
