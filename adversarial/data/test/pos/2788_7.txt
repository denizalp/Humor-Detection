Almost everyday this week, someone was talking about raw fish in one  form or another and the thought of sushi was never far behind. So I met two friends here for dinner after talking to Lisa L. about it at a Yelp event.\n\nWe had ordered the screaming orgasm (8.95); seared tuna on top of a heaping bed of thinly shredded daikon radish, purple cabbage, and carrots. Digging into the mound yielded a feast for the eyes with all the vibrant colors. The creamy sauce on top did not have too much flavor. I would have preferred a stronger ponzu presence, but everything else about the dish was spot on. We also got a basic tiger roll (11.00) and the portion of fish to rice lit a spark in our eyes. If this was any indication of their generosity, we were in good hands. Blue Fin does not skimp on the seafood. We also tried the sunset (12.00); spicy tuna inside, and cajun albacore outside, with a light sauce drizzled over. After that, each new roll looked to be getting progressively bigger, but then again we could have been getting full. The Johnny Johnny (12.00) had then arrived. Golden, crunchy soft shell crab center topped with spicy tuna. The roll was tasty because there were so many contrasting elements. At first, you have the creamy sauce that mellows the heat. Followed by the cold and soft tuna meeting the hot and crispy soft shell crab. It was a roll that someone new to sushi could appreciate. We stopped after the over the rainbow (13.00) because their super rainbow on crack was more than enough. The difference between this and a regular rainbow is instead of a California roll center, they sub a jammed pack fish center. It is worth upgrading for two dollars. I just wished their ponzu had more zip. I am a masochist for a good sour tang. \n\nEven though we did not do the AYCE, we left here more than satisfied. I can only imagine the trouble a person can get themselves into going at it hardcore.
