Holy Moses (or in this case Joseph...that is the owner) this place is worth all the hype. What an absolutely adorable little vegan spot located in OC. Picture people wearing hemp, burning some incense and sitting on a crate eating chia pudding and laughing. That is what it feels like in this place. Organic, simple and just plain comfy. Joseph has an amazing personality and is super nice. He really takes time to get to know ya too. Rocking it Josephâ€‹!\n\nThe Chia Pudding Jar is my new lover. Creamy, sweet and packed with simple flavors and fresh berries....this jar is a container of heaven. Seriously, it rocked my socks!!! I love the fact it comes in a mason jar to take home. \n\nThe Peanut Butter and Tart Cherry Energy Orbz are a fun little treat. You just feel amazing after the first bite. CAUTION: Do not try to fly after eating this product. From personal experience, you do not gain that superpower....although you will feel like you can! I love that these little balls of goodness aren't too sweet, have that nice cherry tang and a very organic and earthy feel to them!\n\nI will definitely be back. Love this place!
