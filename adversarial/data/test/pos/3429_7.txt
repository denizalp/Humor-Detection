I actually really do like Patties. \n\nI like that it's a dive. I like that it's big. I like that it has several bars where alcohol can be obtained. I like the crowd (there's a wide variety of ages and the people who hang out here seem to be down to earth). I like that they have bar games. \n\nThere's on thing I don't like. and it's why I can't give Pattie's anything more than 3 stars. I hate the fact that peopl can smoke on the \"patio!\" This probably makes me sound like a cankerous old man, but I just don't like it. I don't understand how the whole patio works here, because it just seems like an extension of the bar (so it still feels indoors). I really wish Patties would just ban smoking all together.\n\n Now get off my lawn.
