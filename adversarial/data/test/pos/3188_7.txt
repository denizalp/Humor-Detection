Pros:\n\n- $35\/per person for dinner on a weekend.  Yes its a PRO because Bellagio\/Wynn\/Rio are all around that same price, but you have better quality of food. So its a free upgrade from your typical vegas buffets.\n\n- Its definately a new experience since they portion out your food so that you dont 'over eat' an item, which is a good thing so you can have space for other food!\n\n- We came on a saturday night around 7 pm, waited 5 minutes and was seated. Thats faster than waiting in line at the women bathroom at the bellagio buffet. \n\n- The waiters was very very attentive and always there when you needed them. They took away all our plates with quickness so that we can go get more food. \n\nCons:\n\n- NO creme brulee! Apparently, they do have it but not on the night we came...on a SATURDAY NIGHT. The GF really wanted it and I didnt get laid that night because of them. -1 STAR.\n\n- their sushi selection was pretty sad. you get to pick from california roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll and a rick roll. Im going to give them a chance and not subtract a star here since I wouldve gotten laid regardless whether or not they have more selection of sushi.
