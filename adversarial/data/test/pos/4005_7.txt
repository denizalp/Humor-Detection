This restaurant is so ... Vegas, in all good and tacky senses.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:\nIt feels like cheers bar for locals meets las Vegas disco ball. Homey, delicious, friendly.\n\nTHE DECOR:\nBeing inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball. There is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings, only to be distracted by the giant TV screens and neon lighting lining everything. There is a cool lounge in the back area, but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front. Think Denny's on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80's and you kinda have Peppermill, except with fantastic food and gigantic portions.\n\nI fell in love with the decor big time. Each table is a booth, which I love, and has big leather couches. It's arranged so you aren't hidden, but each table has their own little alcove. Like a buncha totally-visible secret gardens or something. Maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout, and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling. Also, big flamingo Tiffany's -esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon, making it almost seem like you're watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night. It's almost peaceful. \n\nTHE FOOD:\nThe coffee, so necessary after any 1\/2-decent night out in Vegas, is Columbian and served in a big cup with free refills. All about it.\n\nMy friends and I shared:\n1) Munch's breakfast, which was saut√©ed peppers, onions, and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top. It was good, and huge, but nothing to write home about.\n2) Maserati omelette - this is Meaty-tomato italian sauce, melted jack and cheddar cheeses, hasbrowns. Served with toast, a bagel, or a muffin. This was fantastic. I would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette, but this was excellent and worth ordering. \n\nWith your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir -- so cheezy, so Vegas, so perfect. I loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekend.\n\nFinally, there's colored sugar. I know, whoopee, but it just tells you what kinda place this is. It's vegas. there are no rules. have fun and roll with it!\n\nIn all, we spent $44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip. A bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being again.\n\nWill definitely be adding this to my Vegas rotations.
