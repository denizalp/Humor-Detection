If I could give this place zero stars I would. \n\nMy friend and I came here and we both sat at the bar. She has a Washington ID and they said they couldn't accept her card because it didn't match their book. They just made themselves look SO stupid because we're both servers at a restaurant and she is actually turning 23 next month. Ridiculous. We weren't even going to order alcohol beverages to begin with. Never come back here again. Stupidest Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever went to. No wonder why they have 3 stars.
