We had to end our Vegas trip with a BANG...and oh we did!! This place is totally a 5 star winner! \nLocated in the most beautiful hotel in Vegas, the Cosmopolitan, we were in for a feast!! \nI forgot my diet...and said..what the heck...this is Vegas...and devoured almost everything is sight. The small bites concept is a great one, because it's just enough to be be able to try so many different ones...and please save room for dessert...those chocolate topped strawberries are delicious!
