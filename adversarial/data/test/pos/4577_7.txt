Good sub shop\n\nI wouldn't say it's my favorite sub shop but it's a go to place to go over subway or blimpie for sure. Kind of a custom 'fast food' resturant. Nice for a quick bite. \n\nYou build your sandwich from a carosel with sandwich bags and magic markers. The bread is fresh, the meats are flavorful, and the veggies selection, is nice.\n\nThe service is very quick, the menu is reasonably priced, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. Not a bad choice for a good sub.
