I came here a number of years ago because it was a place that everyone in my family wanted to try. \n\nWe were disappointed in it.\n\nI remember the service was not that good we had to wait a while to get our food.\n\nEveryone ordered the fish that was on special I believe it was salmon but I can't be 100% sure.\n\nIn any event it was not that great. It was really dry and had very little taste to it.\n\nI would not go back here It was overpriced and in my option the food was not that good.
