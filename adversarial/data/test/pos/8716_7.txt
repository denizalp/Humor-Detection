Yes, this IS the ghetto of the Strip.  Smelly, sketchy and very cheap. \n\nHOWEVER, if you're in Vegas with kids it's a must visit.  The Midway and Arcade are a blast for the little ones.  Total throw back to the shady carnival games of a day gone by (in a good way).  Toss in the free trapeze acts and my 8 & 10 year olds had a ton of fun.\n\nThat alone earned 2 stars from me.  Just wash your hands when you leave.  ;)
