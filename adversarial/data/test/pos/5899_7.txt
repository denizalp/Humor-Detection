A cool little spot very close to where we live which is nice because not much else is close to us!  It gets pretty busy in the evenings.  We were there fairly early in the evening (7ish maybe?) and it was a lot of older people....my husband and I kept remarking how much his parents would love this place.  Even though there was a strange age dichotomy it seemed to work.  The food was great, the portions very large and everything was reasonably priced.  They had several TV's going with various sporting events which was nice.  The music was loud and a bit all over the place...rap to oldies to rock.  We don't mind that and we will definitely be returning many times.\n\nUpdate- Minus 2 stars\n\nI wish this was a more positive update, but alas, it is not.  If there is one thing in this world that you should not do, it's get between me and the Red Sox.\n\nMy husband works from home and sometimes will spend a few days in the house working.  I sensed that he needed to get out and said \"Hey hun, why don't we go to The Office Bar and Grill for some drinks and dinner, just to get you out of the house?\"  We both agreed it was a great idea.\n\nThis happened to be the first time we went for happy hour, which also means the first time we went when the Red Sox were on.  Given that they have 13 televisions I figured they would probably be showing it.  When we walked in the only sporting event that was being televised was the Girls Little League World Series, which I admit, was a tad creepy.  (A bunch of 20 something year old guys watching 12 year old girls?  Yeah, it's creepy.)  I thought, \"wow, that's strange....maybe they didn't get the Extra Innings package...\"  But sure enough a few moments later the Yankees game appeared on some of the TVs.  Recognizing this, we requested the Red Sox game for the TV closest to us, and for about 15-20 minutes we were able to get our fix!  I was ecstatic.  Drink specials and the Sox? Sa-weet.  \n\nMy happiness was short-lived because they were shortly taken off the screens.  We got to watch about a half inning of the game before they started messing with the channels again.   They even took the D-Backs game off!  People at the bar were visibly upset.  Out of about 13 tvs, 3 or 4 were showing the 11-0 Orioles\/Yankees game (at that point who cares?  The Yankees aren't going to pull this one out), about 6 were showing the Reds\/Cubs (NL Central?  For real?) a couple were showing the Detroit\/Cleveland game (slightly more tolerable, but honestly, who cares?) and one tv in the back was showing Fox News!!!  Who turns off a 1-0 pitcher's dual between two of the hottest young lefties in the game, Jon Lester and Scott Kazmir?  Furthermore, how do you turn off a game that was specifically requested by your clientele?  Now you're playing favorites.  And I'm a bad enemy to make.\n\nI really wish that they wouldn't have even let us know they had DirectTV.  Honestly, then I wouldn't have ever been teased with being able to watch the Sox game.  We asked to speak with the manager about it who admitted to us that the only person who really knows how to work the television system is the chef (even though he's been managing the place for 4 MONTHS!).  What?  Are you kidding me?  Teach the barback how to do it for crying out loud.  We would have stayed and had more drinks had we been able to keep watching the game.  The manager even told us that one girl \"over there\" wanted to watch the Indians and \"those people\" wanted to watch the Yankees (yeah? Which people?  No Yankees fan I know wants to watch them when they are losing 11-0!)   And of course one tv has to be dedicated to Fox News at all times.  Can't change off that.  We had even asked to put the Sox game on that tv, even though it was the absolute furthest tv from us.  \"Can you even see that tv?\"  Well it's better than nothing!\n\nSo I now know where NOT to go to watch sporting events and hang out with 40 year olds.  Like I said, nothing comes between me and my Sox.\n\nUpdate to my Update:  Its too bad they didn't keep the game on because this was one of the most exciting games of the season with the Sox pulling it out in the bottom of the 9th.  I would have hung around for many many more drinks.  Oh well.
