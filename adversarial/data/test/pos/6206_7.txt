(SCAM ALERT!!) This company is a complete SCAM! They were attempting to access my bank account and Robert was VERY nasty and started yelling at me when I refused to tell him how much money I had in my bank account!!! Ridiculous! I called them to have me picked up from my hotel then they started to ask for the name on my room which is none of their business so I refused then Robert went on to ask about my personal Financial information. This company is a complete and utter scam do not call for them ever!!! I ask my friends living in vegas about them and they all told me that this limo company is involved in other scams as well! Robert is about 71 years old...why is he still on the road?!?!\n\nOn top of it all, during of his angry babbles Robert claims that his family owns Sapphire which was comical to me because I used to be a Vegas local and is aware that Peter Eliades is the actual owner. If Robert's family is so wealthy why not retire because from the sound of it he doesn't really like his job or any of his customers anyways! I think a retirement is in order!!
