I ordered $40 of food to have it delivered to my workplace tonight.  I asked for chopsticks and utensils when I made my order and they did not give any.  How was I supposed to eat my dinner without any utensils? With my hands?  So I called the restaurant back to have them send me plastic silverware so I can finally eat my cold food.  The lady that answered the phone clearly just said sorry, can you call the driver and ask him to stop by and bring it?  Like seriously?  I don't have the driver's phone number!  I asked if they could bring me silverware and she just said, \"No, sorry\" and hung up on me.  So my sorry a$$ had to the nearest CVS to buy some plastic utensils.\n\nFurthermore, the food was packaged sloppily and the sauce was spilled and leaking from the plastic bag.  Portions were small and the cold food was not appetizing.
