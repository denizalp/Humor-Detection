Loving Hut has great tasting food and a clean bright atmosphere.  We tried three appetizers and had the Pho as the main dish.  The wontons and Pho were great.  For those who care everything was vegetarian and most items were also vegan.  The staff was friendly and the steam table had a nice lunch selection for $7.50.  Bell Road doesn't have it all, come check this place out!   \n\nNote about the d√©cor: I am an omnivore and believe there is nothing intrinsically heroic about being a vegetarian.
