I don't understand why it is so difficult for people to be polite to people when you are requesting your services especially services you're paying for them. I requested food to be delivered to my hotel room and after multiple hold received a lot of attitude and then a statement which stated I would have to order $150 of food in order to get delivery. When I responded that the yelp allowed me to order the food,  continue to give me attitude and said if I place it online they would not deliver it... So that means you guys would take my money and not deliver food??? Never again and please work on the attitude
