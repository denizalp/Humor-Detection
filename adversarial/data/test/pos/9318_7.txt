All over $1. I went into Party City on Oct 20, 2011 and was looking for one particular item, I ran into a particularly common problem where a customer goes into a store and finds two identical products listed at two different prices. Went to check out, cash register shows the higher price. I noted to the cashier that there are two prices listed where I found this item (both the same item). Cashier spoke to the manager (whom was busy filling balloons) - manager said there was nothing that could be done. \n\nI cashed out at the higher price, walked to the manager and asked to come and look what I was talking about. Walked him to the back of the store, he showed me the high price - I showed him the low price, he agreed it was the same product and finally honored the lower price.\n\nI went back to the cash register was credited $1.00+tax back onto my card. If you're an employee of this Party City reading this review and you find yourself too busy to help the customer at a certain time, then believe the fact \"the customer is always right\".
