I could just write \"Kamut 'n Honey\" here, and satisfy myself. But that wouldn't satisfy my readers, so I will expand that.\n\nMeijer is more than a grocery store, more than a department store, more than a toy store - it's a crazy gestalt of weirdness. I had a lot of fun coming here at odd hours of the night and getting things such as a frozen pizza and a copy of Bust a Move for the SNES. Or, one night during finals freshman year, brauschweiger, spackle, and a putty knife. Seriously, where else can you do that at 2AM?\n\nNow to explain my cryptic first comment. We found this strange cereal \"Kamut 'n Honey\" there. It had a big spiel about kamut being the most ancient of grains on the back, and a big Egyptian pharaoh head thing n the front. Crazy stuff. And also a bit scary. I actually ran an experiment one year, where I secretly marked the boxes in the store. Every time I went back, these exact same boxes were there. As far as I know, no one has every bought this cereal (and that's why I believe it no longer exists). The sad thing is, it might have been the greatest cereal ever, but I was too busy laughing at the absurdness of it to ever try it. And now I will never know.
