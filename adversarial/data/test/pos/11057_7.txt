I've been to Flemings probably a dozen times in San Diego and Rancho Cucamonga.  This is my first time to the Las Vegas location.  The set up, size, vibe, and service is as consistent as it gets, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  I'm fine with the service and ambiance for the most part.  My only issue is the noise.  Tough to enjoy your steak and company when all you hear is everyone's conversation.  Regardless, I still had a decent dinner with the gf here the other night. \n\nAs for my meal, I have never deviated from their 8 oz petite filet mignon.  Before dinner, I scoped out the menu and contemplated on something different.  But guess what? I chose the petite filet again.  The steak was decently sized, but was a little disappointed on the overall taste. I got my steak medium-well and thought it was too pink. As for taste, I thought it was just \"A-Ok\".  For a pinkish steak, I thought it tasted burnt. I don't know if it was Fleming's or if my taste in steaks have changed. Price is about what you expect at a steakhouse.  However, I've had better steaks with the same price points.  \n\nOverall, will I be back?  I'm sure I will one day.  Maybe next time I'll try their lobster or seafood.\n\nPS:  Their Mushrooms Ravioli is phenomenal.
