$600 minimum for a reservation for drinks at 6:30pm (seriously?) and they also asked how many men, and how many women would be in my party...\n\nAre you...even allowed to ask that? Made me feel weird and uncomfortable. \n\nShame because the one time I went there it seemed pretty cool and I was excited to go back with friends :(\n\nPS to the owners: those kind of requisites make it very easy for you to become a sausage party corporate bummer VERY fast.
