All in at this location, too.  Line moved quickly and efficiently.  The Friday lunch special I ordered was brisket with extra bark, collard greens, and mac-n-cheese.  All for under $10.  Delicious.  I think (other than my own) their collards are the best around.  \n\nWhat a pleasant sight and smell on Monroe Road.  Welcome!
