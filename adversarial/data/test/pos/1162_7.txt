Think Cedar Plank...\n\nNow think hand rubbed red spice British Columbia Rockfish...\n\nNow think Northwest Vegetables... baby carrots, peas and onions\n\nNow think wilted Spinach with bits of garlic...\n\nNow sit in an air conditioned  booth underneath a 50 pound plus stuffed Chinook (King) Salmon\n\nNow savor the moment for in a few minutes you will be out in the 100 plus degree heat and wishing you were in the Northwest next to the sea shore or river or forest or any cool green and blue location
