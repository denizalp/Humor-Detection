It has been a long journey finding this man, he is genius. I may be slightly obsessed with a perfect smile, but who isn't? How do I know this? I have been threw 2 other dentists and now I'm not going anywhere. First dentist was completely incompetent and butchered my teeth. Second dentist, was good but reminded me of a used car salesman with his sales tactics. \n\nDr. Costaras is extremely professional and he really does respect your time. No waiting for 10 minutes or more when you have an appointment scheduled. His whole team is incredible, especially Laura who is the receptionist. \n\nThe proof is in the pudding, just check out my picture perfect smile:D
