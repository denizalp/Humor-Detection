5 stars all over for these guys. Seriously, they are the best in the Limo industry. \n\nWe used Presidential Limo three times during our wedding extravaganza. The first time was to picked us up at the airport. It was a surprise for Jesse and my family. Everybody were amazed with the limo, the complimentary bottle of champagne, and how cool our driver was. He even tied all the baggage compartment because we had too many bags. It looked so ghetto but we didn't care.  Our driver was so awesome, I seriously wanted us to be BFF. \n\nThe second time we used them was for us to go to the Courthouse to pick up our license. We rented the Lincoln Towncar. Our second driver was so tall (feel bad that I forgot their names) and he's so funny. He told us stories of Las Vegas on the way there. When we got there, he walked us to the door of the courthouse. That way we didn't get bother by these people who stand around outside the courthouse to try to sell you chapel packages. After that, he dropped us off at Monte Carlo. It was a nice ride and worth the extra money.\n\nThe third time was for after reception party tour bus. I rented the party bus to take us up and down the strip. We stopped by at The Las Vegas sign and we took tons of pictures there. The bus was fun. Complimentary champagne were flowing and they also have bottle water. The bus has a strip pole in it. Fun fun fun. The only downside was they only have radio stations instead of ipod plug in or anything like that. The party bus was definitely the highlight of the night.\n\nWe recommend Presidential Limo to everybody we know and anyone who's visiting Las Vegas. It's a little bit more than cabs, but since cabs in Vegas long haul everybody like crazy mine as well pay extra for comfort, cleanliness, and fun ride.
