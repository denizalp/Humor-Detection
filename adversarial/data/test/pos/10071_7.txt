The staff have terrific service skills. The food was good and also reasonably priced. The bench back had a bamboo strip across the top that stuck me in my upper back. That made the seating a bit tiring after awhile. Prices for Ramen Noodle Bowls were around seven dollars and Udon Noodles were around eight. I will come back for more.
