I ordered a beer, bartender asked for an ID. I gave it to him, I guess he could not read, he asked for my driver's license. I showed that to him, he still could not read.\nMy ID is an official ID from Switzerland, so is the driver's license. If this bigot (or just idiot) can't accept foreigners, a place where tourists can come by may not be the right job for him.
