I had a wonderful experience here.  A friend and I got pedicures, and it was an incredibly relaxing experience.  The woman doing my nails was very kind and friendly, the massage chair felt fantastic, and my nails have not chipped at all (despite wearing shoes, socks, swimming, and running) over the past few weeks.  Will definitely go back and would highly recommend!
