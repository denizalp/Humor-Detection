Came here a couple months Ago And was not impressed with service at all!! \nLove the atmosphere the colors, the way the bar was set up is very cool! Tv were the best especially for football or college NCAA!! I could see this place doing great and would love to watch the games here but... I sat down and was playing poker! Went through $40 before I even got a beer! Asked for a menu got NOTHING  \n2 of my friends join me and still took for ever to get a drink! Asked for a menu again...\nGamed over 200$ and got charged for all my drinks.\nWent back one more time with some of my co-workers from the lodge lets just say between 5 people and $700 THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I WILL EVER GO BACK THERE.
