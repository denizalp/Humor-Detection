Have you seen the movie? You do know there is a movie based on this musical, right? It stars Tom Cruise and is pretty much exactly like this musical except with more of a plot? Like, if you're on the fence about seeing this show, go to Redbox and spend $1.31 and see if you like it. If you don't, don't waste your money.  \n\nIf you don't like 80s power ballads, you will not like this show.\nIf you don't like musicals, you will not like this show.\nIf you don't like upskirt views of pretty ladies, don't sit in the first 10 rows.\n\nEveryone else will probably like this show.  The performers do a great job, and it's fun to sing along (and they even hand out these little plastic fake lighter thingies for you to hold up!).  Pretty trite storyline, but what else would you expect? It's just a vehicle for 80s songs! I had seats right  down front, but it's not a huge venue, so it probably doesn't matter, unless you have strong feelings either way about the aforementioned upskirt views.  \n\nIt's about two hours long, with a SEVEN minute intermission.  My friend made it to the ladies room in time, so I say go for it. Especially if you get a giant double (quadruple?) Jameson in a souvenir sippy cup and end up feeling like you might pee your pants by the time its over.  \n\nAlso a word on drinks: the bartender who waited on us was super cool and actually tried to give us a good deal on the pretty ridiculously priced drinks.  I ordered the double Jamo and he goes to put it in the sippy cup (1 shot= $14, and apparently any drink in the sippy cup is $20).  So he proceeds to pretty much fill my 16 oz cup with booze.  \n\nIt's a fun show, not so impressive as a Cirque exploit; but if you've hit all the other shows or hate acrobats or fear clowns, this is a good alternative, especially if you ain't lookin' for nothing but a good time.  (SEE WHAT I DID THERE?!)
