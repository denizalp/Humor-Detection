So I've been trying to find another nail salon close that is close to my house that is good at designs. Goodness, it's hard finding a good one that is reasonably priced!\n\nThey are located down the street from my house so it's very convenient. I wanted a gel manicure with a Christmas design. ( See photo) It's $25 for a gel manicure. I think she did a good job. I'd like to come back to see if they would be able to do some more detailed designs.
