I have had my fair share of Korean barbecue dining experiences since I started eating Korean food in high school because my neighbors were Korean and they owned a restaurant themselves. My first time, I fell in love and still think it is one of my favorite Asian cuisines. Unfortunately, good Korean restaurants in the Phoenix area are spread thin and when I heard about this new restaurant in town, I got excited. \n\nThe restaurant is in the Desert Ridge Marketplace. There wasn't very many people dining and my first impression is that it's because of the fancy and expensive menu and prices while the restaurant decor and ambiance doesn't seem to quite match it. It looks like a casual, quick spot with no catchy decor so of course you immediately expect inexpensive prices.\n\nWe asked for a table and they had us wait for 5-7 minutes even though there wasn't very many people in the restaurant because they wanted to put all the little side dishes out first. We decided to order the small beef combo and you get to pick four different meats. We decided on the kimchi stew with brisket, boneless short rib, marinated short rib, and marinated thinly sliced beef. We also had to order white rice which was extra.  We practically ate everything and we were full but not full enough. The taste? It's meh. \n\nOur server actually cooked the food for us which is unusual. We normally cook the food ourselves in other establishments. The prices too are higher than other Korean BBQ restaurants I've been to especially for the portions you get. Our total bill with tip was almost $100!! \n\nI'm not a fan. Expensive prices, small portions, a boring atmosphere\/ambiance = no thanks.
