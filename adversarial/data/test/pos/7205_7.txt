Wish I could rate it negative stars. If you like a good % of the members on steroids then this is the place for you.  Over crowded!! Phony people!!  Also, guys actually working out in the sauna while using cel phones. Really!!\n Customer corporate service is horrible. This place cares about one thing only, MONEY!!  Any gym that you can go to that has a car washing service in the parking lot is a joke. So, if you are a normal person, stay away from this place.
