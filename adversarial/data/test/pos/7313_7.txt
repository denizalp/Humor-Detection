I had never had a facial before, so when Groupon offered a \"signature pumpkin orange peel and micro-derm skin spatula\" treatment at Divine Skin Spa for $39, I didn't think twice. The spa is less than a mile from my house, so the choice was easy.\n\nThere's no outside sign on the establishment, but there are also not a lot of businesses in the plaza, so I was able to figure it out after a few minutes of driving around. Once I entered the spa, I saw that it's a lot like going into a massage therapy location: dimly lit, water fountains in the corners of the room, and soft music playing. I filled out my consent form and back I went.\n\nI was led to a room by Rebecca, my esthetician, who directed me to strip down, cover with a wrap-around towel, and hop up on the treatment table. Since I'd never done this before, I didn't realize so much would be happening. I was in for a treat.\n\nDuring my roughly 50 minutes of treatment, my face and chest were washed twice, the pumpkin orange peel was applied (which smelled heavenly!), I received an arm and hand massage, the peel was scraped with some kind of electrical spatula, my face was moisturized twice and washed, and I got a full bust massage.\n\nI'm a big fan of massages, and unfortunately, most LMTs are hesitant to rub faces and heads - so this was a slice of heaven for me. I was totally in a different zone. Rebecca told me everything that she was doing, gave me hints on aftercare (expect some flaking, hydrate a lot), and told me about their monthly membership.\n\nFor $39 a month (normally $49), Divine members can receive a signature facial, 50-minute massage, peel, or hydrating body treatment. Unused months roll over to be combined and it can be canceled at any time. Sure, I shouldn't have purchased, but why would I deny myself this slice of heaven on a monthly basis? I very much look forward to returning next month.
