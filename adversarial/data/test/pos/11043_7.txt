Meh!  Meh!   Meh!  \n\nThis buffet was recommended to my boyfriend and I so we waiting in a loooooog line on a Sunday.    There were two things I was looking for in the buffet - crab legs and  Eggs Benedict.  This Sunday buffet did not offer *either* of them.  It was very disappointing.      There was nothing special about this buffet - it was the typical frozen food prepped and sitting out under a warming light.
