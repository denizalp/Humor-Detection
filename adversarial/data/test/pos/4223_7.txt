I happened to come here because my favorite down the street had a line out the door as usual. I got my pho fix and it hit the spot for me. The place looks new and super clean - my hot pho came out super fast with super fresh greens. I don't care for service much because most Asian places suck at it anyway - but it was great here. Very happy, I would come back.
