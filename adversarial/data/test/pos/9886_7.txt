On yelp, I usually review places that already have a lot of reviews.  This is one place that I want to spread the hype on myself, because it's not a typical place people will shop.\n\nNot that I have anything against grilling the normal fare like steaks, hot dogs, burgers, but sometimes I crave kebob from overseas.  But the issue with this is where to buy the meat, especially if you want it already marinaded.  I called a bunch of my friends in Vegas asking for a place that sells good marinated meat for kebobing\/ grilling.  I gave up on this search myself because I went to a bunch of middle russian\/middle eastern stores.  They didn't even have meat, or the selection was awful.  Finally someone tipped me off to a relatively new store called Max Market.\n\nI am so happy I found this place.  The store is clean, and the owners are very very cool.  The meat selection is amazing, and there marinade is great, reminds me of the Los Angeles stores we used to go to.\n\nAnyway, even if it's a drive, I highly recommend people to shop here.  Whether it's for their meat (highlight) or produce or random stuff you are craving (foreign beer, spices, etc.) So happy I found this place!!!
