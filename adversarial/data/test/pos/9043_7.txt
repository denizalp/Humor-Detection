Just so you know there are over 70 \"not recommended\" 1 star reviews involving cockroaches soooo I would scroll down if I were you and read the hidden reviews and see what people really think about this casino. \n\nGoes to show Sunset Station obviously paid Yelp to hide 70 1 star reviews. Just sad and speaks volumes about this place. Having personally stayed here two years ago I can agree with the other 1 star reviews on how dirty their rooms are. Motel room standards at Hotel prices. Why do the dirty Casinos always need to be where the locals go?
