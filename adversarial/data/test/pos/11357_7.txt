Cleveland Hopkins consistently delivers a positive, quick and easy, airport experience. Today I got felt up by the TSA (for free!) and they also did a full check of my bag and it STILL took me less than 15 minutes to get through security. Plus they fly some great, easy experience airlines, like Southwest. Self-bag tagging at the arrival gate was so easy, especially with my electronic boarding pass. I got here one hour before my flight was set to board and I still had forty minutes of downtime! \n\nThey have plenty of small stops for magazines, books, beers (Great Lakes Brewery anyone?) and snacks but I brought my own snacks which is also apparently part of the reason my bag was searched! I don't mind, I love when other people are forced to witness what an excellent packer I am... A full outfit in my handbag y'all!! (Plus beef jerky, trail mix, and a chocolate bar!)\n\nMy coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts here was $2.52, cheap enough to keep my happy while I finish off this review, read a book, and wait for my flight to board.
