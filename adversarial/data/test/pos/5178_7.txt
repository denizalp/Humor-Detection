I know how futile it is to write this review, because FedEX moves the world around, and that ain't gonna change. But holy hell. What an ordeal. Must. Tell. Someone. \n\nI have lived strictly in super large cities as an adult, so I don't have a current driver's license. I do, however, have a photo health card and a wallet filled with pieces of ID with my name on it. I presented it after my husband rented a zip car to help me pick up a whole whack of packages. They wouldn't take my ID. OK, well what are we going to do about it? I can't be the only one to face this pickle. \n\nI asked if they could call the sender to release the package, the dude helping me said no. I asked if they could redeliver, he said no. After being visibly agitated and laughed at (yes, he giggled at me while I stood there struggling with what to do) he finally called someone else over. The new lady then said they could call the sender. Progress! When they called at first the sender didn't answer so I tried from my cell, they then said I couldn't call. OKKKK. I asked them for their direct FedEx line so this woman could call back and release the almighty parcels. They said she should call the 1-800 number. WHAAAT. \n\nAt this point, my normally sweet-as-pie husband lost it. I don't blame him, but I tried to keep it as Canadian as possible and finally the first guy (the smug one who laughed at me, what a peach) got the sender on the phone. Hooray they finally agreed to give me my stuff. As I was leaving I could see the employees through the glass window mocking me. All I did was ask them repeatedly to help me resolve this wonky situation. Did I lose you there? Oh probably, I'm pretty pissed. \n\nRules are rules for a reason, and I get that, but there's always a way to fix it, and there is no need to make paying customers feel like crap. My one wish for these smug folks who almost ruined my day? I hope they work at a FedEx depot forever. Forrrreeeevvvvveeerrrr.
