As others have explained, their menu is very limited, offering only 3 types of chicken strips (baked, grilled or fried) and 3 types of sides (baked mac n cheese, grilled veggies or french fries)... and all combos come with Texas Toast.  Oh and I think they offer a salad too, but I didn't even look at that. haha\n\nFor our first BFG experience, there were 3 of us, so we thought we should try all 3 types of chicken fingers.  We ordered 3 combos -- the baked, the fried, and the grilled.  None of us wanted to be healthy and have the grilled veggies, so we subbed another order of mac n cheese on that one.\n\nTo our surprise (being the fried chicken strip lovers we are), we all decided the GRILLED strips were the best!  I think because we were comparing the fried ones to Raising Cane's.  Sorry, guys, but I do think Cane's has ya beat in that department.\n\nBUT... Cane's doesn't offer delicious, creamy mac n cheese baked in a cute little individual-sized bowl.  And they don't offer.... drum roll.... NINE DIPPING SAUCES.  Mmm mmm... we got to try 6 of them and they all made our chicken finger experience EXTRA deelish.  I especially loved the wasabi cream sauce (thanks to all the Yelp recommendations for that)! They were all really good, though.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest.\n\nAs everyone has mentioned already, the owners are SUPER nice and make ya feel very welcome.  In fact... yes you can call me anti-social and I'll probably get blasted for this.... but I kinda thought Jin was a little TOO nice.  I love eating somewhere where the person behind the counter actually cares about pleasing the customer.  I really do.  But I also think there's a fine line between being friendly and being annoying.  Jin was teetering on that line throughout our lunch.\n\nI do think it's impressive how he really makes a point to learn everyone's names, but I'd really be ok if he didn't keep saying my name (followed by a question) every 3 or 4 minutes while I'm trying to eat and socialize with my family.  Know what I mean?\n\nWe'll definitely be back, though. Good chicken, great prices, friendly people.  I wish them great success.
