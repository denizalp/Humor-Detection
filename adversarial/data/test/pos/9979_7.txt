I had the opportunity to try Cobs Bread's cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting after trying to find more local bakeries that offered cinnamon rolls. \n\nThe cinnamon rolls are not baked in a tray where they're all touching each other so that means that the textures of the cinnamon roll should be consistent (i.e. if they were baked together in those pans, the middle rolls would be much softer than the ones on the edges). As a result, the cinnamon roll was slightly burnt and hard on the edge and soft enough on the inside for me to devour. Cream cheese frosting is excellent and there's enough cinnamon and brown sugar to make it a treat! However, I would have much enjoyed it more if was softer. I'd totally come back to try their other products. I also appreciate how they only sell food that was baked the same day. We all need some freshness!
