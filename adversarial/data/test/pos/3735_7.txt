Probably between 2 and 3 stars, I'm knocking this down to 2 stars because I have high expectations for Vegas.\n\nWhen I think of Vegas, I think of exceptional design, and I was less than impressed with the Delano.  It's a fine hotel, we had a good time!  But with all the beautiful options in Vegas, this one could use some work.  I'd like to offer my constructive criticism.\n\nThe entry:  A couple of random rocks, then a hallway with curtain columns that were cool as a concept, but not good enough if you're a Vegas hotel.  It was very dark.  I did, however, like the rock formation art.  Because this is so bare bones, you can really notice the particular details.  Changing those columns, getting a new designer, and getting a lighting designer would do wonders for this entry (and hotel).  \n\nThe theme:  Rocks?  Does this tie in with the spa somehow?  There were also some quotes written on mirrors- if you were thinking I would instagram this, I can't, because the lighting is too dark, and it's not very pretty and instagram-able.  I think the theme was inspired by the beautiful rock formations in Utah\/ Arizona, and this was supposed to be a more glamorous version of that, but I don't think it worked.  If your theme is rocks, why don't you advertise some amazing stone massage to me?  Do you have some kind of beautiful rustic sauna?  Stone-ground chocolate?  Cedar-plank salmon (tofu for me)?  I'm left wanting to connect with the theme in some way. \n\nThe rooms: Great view of the Luxor from our room!  Our bedrooms were all white, totally meh design.  Get some color, texture, or shapes in there to make it more interesting.  Why are the rooms all white, but the bathrooms and lobby\/hotel are all dark?  Tie them in somehow.  I liked the seating area idea underneath the tv.  Bathrooms were dark, black.  Great deep tub!  When we walked in, there were postcards on our pillows with what was probably supposed to be inspiring quotes, but they were totally de-motivational!  Check your quotes!  We got a good laugh out of it, but I'm sure that's not what you wanted!  Note: my friend who works in PR for the Four Seasons Hotels was VERY impressed with the bathrobes.  \n\nFood: Didn't try, didn't see room service menu.  Looked at the restaurants, but went to the Wynn for more vegan options.  If the room service menu was in my room somewhere, I didn't see it- I would have maybe gotten little something.\n\nI really think this hotel has amazing potential, I loved that you do not have to bypass any casinos, and I think you can do a lot with the glamorous\/ rock\/ spa\/ wisdom theme.  Adding crystal to the design theme would be very appropriate with your earthy glam theme, plus provide some Vegas sparkle.  People here were nice, a woman cleaning didn't know how to work my iphone camera, why not teach all the staff how to use iphone cameras in case guests ask?  \n\nThis hotel gets by having good design, good rooms, good staff, but could really use something above and beyond to bring me back, because otherwise, I'm happier to stay at the Venetian.
