I cannot describe how many times I have driven past this place, as for a while it was on my regular commute.  Well, that explains why I would be in the neighborhood.  Unfortunately I would drive past because it looked like there was no possible way it could be open for business.\n\nYou know the stories of how bridges and castles are brought over from other countries brick-by-brick, then reassembled?  This parking lot is like that, only the historical purpose here is so that you will know what it is like to traverse a minefield (minefields exploded leaving giant holes in the asphalt) from the Korean War.  While there are not a ton of businesses inside the mall itself, it would be nice if there was at least one path to the mall that allowed you to not require to get your car aligned.\n\nThe reason being is that there are some good businesses within.  Le's is perhaps the best purveyor of Banh Mi in Crown Town.  Pho Daravan also offers Banh Mi, but not as deep a selection - in fact they only had one when we were there.  Not one to choose from, but a single sandwich (they ran out after we ate that one).  They do have pho, however, and a plant that seems to sprout from a single pot to take over the entire restaurant.  And there is perhaps one of the most interesting restaurant supply stores you will ever find (though the quality of some items may be suspect).\n\nYou can also find a number of Asian-themed businesses and even outreach services, and generally there are detailing services in the parking lot too.  What they really need is a good quality auto service to provide that alignment.  They would make a killing.  Of course, as you leave, they would just need to do it again.
