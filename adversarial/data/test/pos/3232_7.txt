Normally I like this place, but finding a hair on the avocado black bean is not desired.\nReceived another burger, but with same avocado and hair. I'm so upset!\nSpoke to manager and he said it was a different burger. The funny part is, I made a mark on the avocado to make sure I wouldn't receive the same burger. Well, I was given the same exact burger. \nI will never eat here again. They are disgusting.
