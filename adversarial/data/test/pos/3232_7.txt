Small coffee shop by the hospital- BF stops in here frequently and has been raving about the blue velvet drink. Finally made it in here to try it myself, and was pleasantly surprised by the cafe.\n\nAmple seating, friendly staff, well-stocked pastry case with a selection of \"tipsy truffles\"- alcohol infused chocolates. There's also a full lunch menu with soups and sandwiches. Coffee menu has several iced and hot options.\n\nBlue Velvet was underwhelming. BF said the balance was off and it wasn't as good as usual. I think I would have preferred the red velvet, which is a raspberry version.
