If I could give negative stars.. let's just say it would need to be infinite.. Though that statement may seem a bit harsh at first.. please indulge further and you will understand the horror and frustration that I had the pleasure of encountering.\n\nWe purchased an engagement ring through MJ Christensen at the Boca Park location back in 2008.  Everyone at that time was so pleasant, so full of promise .. all the guarantees of the world... I totally thought \"what a great family run business.. great environment.. awesome how they treat customers.. glad to know that if SOMeTHInG were to happen to my ring.... rest assured, like any other jeweler (I'm sure)... the workmanship will be backed and covered!\n\nNow let's skip over to the winter of 2015... My husband and I start looking to upgrade my ring.. You see, MJ has an amazing \"upgrade\" program that states you can upgrade for $1... that's a whole another topic that we'll have to tackle later.. basically, I had them clean the current ring and stated that I felt the ring needed inspection.. I felt the setting seemed a bit loose.. I was assured that the setting was \"solid\" not loose.. so we never came to a feasible agreement to upgrade, and we made it to this day .. March 02, 2016..\n\nI am walking around he market with my cousin.. you see, I have this tendency to adjust my ring constantly.. I like the solitaire to be perfectly center on my finger.... So I adjusted the ring upon entry.. and not 30 min later.. \"tahdah\" GONE!!!! the entire freaking setting of the 4 prong solitaire just plop.. gone... I am staring done at my plain platinum band that is miraculously just missing the diamond.... Mind you., this is a Hearts of Fire diamond to top it off.. so immediately I feel panicked.. I back track every single step.. I look at every aisle.. every possible nook and cranny.. that diamond is nowhere to be found.. Lucky for me, MJ has an awesome guarantee on their workmanship right? WRONG!!! \n\nSo BOB advises me to come into the store.. upon arrival.. they let me know that the store manager is with a client so I'll need to wait.. Which was fine by me, but I found a bit odd since I know that \"Bob\" happens to be the owner? anyhow.. A woman that I did not have the pleasure of catching her name, she states she's the manager, that it's \"her store\" (has a pretty thick Eastern European accent) tries to act as if she's going to help me.. She keeps trying to keep the volume at a minimum.. I'm sure the last thing they wanted to do was announce that \"a DIAMOND FeLL off the BAND they MADE\"....... basically.. fast forwarding through the BS... they tried to force blame on myself.. stating that I needed to bring in inspection paperwork to account for the last 8 years every 6 months apart.. or they can't do anything.. \n\nthey threatened to call the cops on me... Customer Service?? hmm.. Trashy trashy business ethics... good one.. trying to blame a customer.. this situation could have been handled with some class.. This was a horrifying day for myself.. and this piss poor of a joke company iced the cake... If you're looking to be treated well when purchasing .. and as trash thereafter.. please indulge this company.. because that is EXaCTLy what you will get.. Shame on you as a local business... I will announce your bad business ethics and practice to everyone I know forever..
