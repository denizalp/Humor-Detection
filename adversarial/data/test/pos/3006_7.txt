Wheatless & Meatless... this is probably going to break a few people into hives just thinking about it BUT WAIT.  This place will really surprise you with flavour and actually make you full.  \n\nIf you were looking for a great tasting and filling meal, this is a great spot.  It is gluten free and vegetarian.  You're still with me? It also seems to be home to all the yoga pants wearing Torontonians. I had no idea we were keeping lululemon sales up with this one block of millenials.  So even if you don't look the part of a curated Instagram yoga pant wearing millenial, you should step into this great spot and try it out.\n\nSo the restaurant is a fast causal place and it's just south of the Chinatown.  It's right at the corner of Spadina and Richmond.  Otherwise known as Spandex and Rich Man ... overheard that while in line.  It's a great spot as it has huge windows that let in the sunlight and lots of dog and people watching.  The place is pretty clean and has a fair number of tables.  It does get busy for Sunday lunch time as it was about 70% full.  Natural light caramel woods, large white wall swatches, and dashes of greenery are everywhere and it brings a warmth to the place.  The place is photographs amazingly.\n\nCauliflower Tahini Bowl - bright and colourful, this large salad bowl came with a lot of different shredded vegetables and a large roasted cauliflower.  It had carrots, purple cabbage, Lettuce, beets, radish, quinoa, green leaves, pomegranate seeds, seed crackers, and with a big scoop of hummus.  There was a of nice textures and crunch .... perhaps a bit too much? I got a large 3 inch carrot slice.  Overall, mixing it up with the tahini and hummus, you got a nice fresh crunch bite each time.  I barely could finish the bowl so it's a generous amount for a meal.  I liked it and wanting to try other ones to see how they are! 4\/5\n\nZucchini Cauliflower soup - at first I thought this would be a bland mushy soup and I was very wrong.  It was a very creamy soup and full of zest with a good helping of spices and pepper.  They mentioned it had no cream either so for all vegans, this soup is perfect to get your body warmed up without feeling bloated or heavy either.  For the addition of $5 to the bowl, it was generous and huge portion.  4\/5\n\nWhat's not to love... great tasting food, healthy, generous portions, great space, and fairly affordable.  It's so hard to find spots like this in Toronto so when it's good, it's definitely a spot to keep coming back to.
