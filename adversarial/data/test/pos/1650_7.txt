As mentioned, Abe is no longer there...and that's too bad.  I will never take my shoes here again.  They are disorganized and have very poor customer service.  Here is what happened:\n\nI took three pairs of shoes in for repairs.  I went back two weeks later, after they said the shoes would be ready.  I picked up two pairs.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for the second pair because they did not shine them like they were suppose to.  Furthermore, they could not find my third pair of shoes.  The guy who runs the place now (a short middle aged hispanic man)  told me he would look for it and get back to me.  He said he had to speak with the person who took my shoes in when I first brought them.  \n\nA week passed and he did not call me when he said he would.  I called them.  They still had not located my shoes.  Again, the guy who runs the place told me he would look for them and give me a call back.  \n\nAnother week passed and again, I never got a call.  So, again, I called them.  Still no shoes.  I told him that he needed to do something about the fact that they could not find my shoes.  That I was tired of waiting. Four weeks had passed since I had dropped off my shoes.  He asked how much my shoes were, if I had a receipt, and what brand.  I told him that I didn't have a receipt and that I did not know the brand.  Who still has a receipt for a pair of shoes they bought a year ago?  And I don't pay attention to name brands.  I just buy what I like.  However I did know that I paid about $100 for the shoes.  After I told him this, again, he said he would call me back in a couple of days. \n\nAgain, he never called me and I had to call him.  He told me he would only compensate me $30 for the pair of shoes that they lost, citing some \"law\" stating that without a receipt he only had to compensate customers for 25-50% of the cost of the shoes.  I asked him what \"law\" he was speaking of and he didn't say.  I told him I would speak to an attorney to get some information about my rights and that I would get back to him.  BTW:  If you are an ASU student, you can get free legal advice.  \n\nAbout 10 minutes after that last conversation, I get a call from the same guy I had been speaking with the whole time, and guess what?  They found my shoes.  I went to pick them up the same day.  \n\nI was happy they found my shoes.  However, I was also upset at the way they handled the whole situation.  The guy who runs this place now never called me when he said he would, kept telling me he would look for my shoes, only offered me $30 as compensation, never apologized or felt bad for loosing\/misplacing my shoes and putting me through what he did, and I did not get my shoes back till more than a month later after threatening legal action. \n\nI would not recommend this business to anyone.
