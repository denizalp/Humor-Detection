I have always wanted to get a straight razor shave, I have just never found the reason. I put it on the 30 for 30 list knowing there is no shortage of places in Vegas to get it done, but when I saw the Groupon I knew this was an offer too good to pass up.\n\nI walked into the shop a little nervous, I was going to trust a total stranger to take a straight razor to my throat. But after meeting the guys, I was put at ease. The staff very professional and the shop was nice. There was a flatscreen TV showing the baseball game, a few barber stations, some comfy chairs in the waiting area, and Frank and Dean playing on the stereo, what's not to love.\n\nI got there right in time for my appointment and was seated in my chair right away. I have gotten my share of haircuts in my day and usually it's just hop up, snip snip snip, and you're on your way. That however is not the case at Elliott and Co, first we talked about what I wanted for a hair cut, then it he cut for a good 20 mins taking his time to make sure everything was done correctly. They tapered the back of my neck (usually it's just rounded off, but the taper looks great). Then it was time for a wash, shampoo, and conditioner treatment.\n\nAfter the cut and wash it was time for the shave. As I stated I've never had a straight razor shave and I was a little nervous, but once it started I wondered why I waited so long to get one. It started off with a hot towel treatment. Then the a few a hot lather (I really need to get one of those machines so amazing). Then like a surgeon he took the razor to my face. I will admit it feels a little weird, and you can hear the whiskers as they get cut. It took a little longer than I expected, but they shaved both with and against the grain. After the shave, there was a mask was applied (also a first for me). The mask came off, there was a cold towel treatment followed by a few oils.\n\nAfter the shave, they took the time to clean up all the edges of my haircut with the straight razor, and even took care of my pesky unibrow.\n\nI forgot my phone at home so I have no before and after photos, but let's just say my hair is the shortest it's been in years (and it actually looks decent), and my face is smoother than it's been since my first pimple broke out.\n\nAll in all the entire process took around an hour and a half, and I have to say it's an experience I'll never forget. Many thanks to the guys at Elliott & Co as well as Groupon for helping me scratch one of my list. I will without a doubt be back!
