Owned and managed by Matt Ellis and George Brown, Seven Crowns  is a new destination for custom tattoos. These guys have tons of experience, and the work speaks for itself. \n\nThe space is intimate and cozy; which is crucial when considering taking off your clothes for certain placements of ink. (I had a less then fantastic experience at TCB - I love the guys to death, but it ain't a private place to do business. If I'm gonna drop my pants I want to be sure that the passing public isn't going to be checking out my butt.)
