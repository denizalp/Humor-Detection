Love this place. Country egg Benedict and short rib Benedict were A+ amazing.\n\nThey don't take reservations as is customary with most brunch places so expect a line during peak hours.\n\nTwo chefs here...one is Mexican inspired and the other does the French side. Both sides are delicious! Chilaqiles are supposed to be the most popular dish on the menu but we went with the French side because we were in the mood for Benedict.\n\nOur Benedict came out ($13-15) and it was super delicious. Easily one of the best Benedicts I've ever had. \n\nCountry Benedict came with this huge chicken fried steak with jalape√±o gravy on top of biscuits.\n\nShort rib Benedict had this arugula type veggie with English muffins and the softest short rib meat with an awesome Benedict sauce.\n\nBelieve me everything was delicious and we ate it all so fast. One Benedict order is huge and could probably feed 1.5-2 people.\n\nI could not reccomend this place more...ambiance was so nice and the smell of the whole roasting pig in the outdoor smoker really fires up your appetite. \n\nGreat concept and I'll be coming back!
