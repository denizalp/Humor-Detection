I was going out with my boyfriend and our best friends for dinner and drinks and it was my turn to pick the place.\n\nThe pressure!  Do I pick and old standby, tried and true?  \nOr gamble it and go with a new place that we haven't deemed worthy yet, risking their polite scorn??  I decided to gamble it.  \n\nI found this new little BBQ place on Yelp; practically still in it's infancy.  I announced my edict to them; we would be dining here.  To be honest I was a little anxious bringing my gang to an unvetted restaurant, but I didn't let them know it...never let them see you sweat.  (Because it's gross.)\n\nHoly smokes, if these guys didn't make me the hero of the hour!!    Not only was our food stellar (we had the Superstition Combo), but the beer selection was good, my margarita was rock solid, the service was friendly and efficient, and the whole tab was less than what we'd play at the 'other place'.  You know...our FORMER favorite place to get drinks and dinner.\n\nOh, and there was a Yelp check-in offer for free chicharrones, and I'll tell you those were the best chicharrones I've ever had made fresh.  They were still popping when we got them and lightly dusted with chili powder and lime...amazing.
