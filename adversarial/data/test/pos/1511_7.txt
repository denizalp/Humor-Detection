Although I loved the program experience I had at GCU, now that I'm graduated I feel that I was recruited under false pretenses.  I was promised grants and loan forgiveness by a recruiter, and none of that came into play.  At this time I am responsible for the entirety of my loan.  GCU is just one among many for-profit colleges that care about the money they make more than keeping a good reputation.
