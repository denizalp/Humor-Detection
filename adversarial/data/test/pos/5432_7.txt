The food is decent, but a word of advice.  Never sit outside if you see ducks out there.\n\nCase and point - I met my ex there for lunch.  The ducks were very active about leaving their droppings on the porch area where we were sitting.  When someone startled one of the ducks, it flew, dropping a bomb on the table next to us.\n\nIf you eat inside, it's not so bad.  They really need to do something about the ducks though.
