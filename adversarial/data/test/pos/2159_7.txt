If you want to have a date night at a beautiful restaurant enjoying a glass of wine and small bites, this is the place to be.\n\nThe hostess was very welcoming. Shortly after we were seated, our waitress showed up shortly after introducing their drinks and food menu to us. She knows the menu very welcome and could tell us the detail of how each dish is being cooked and prepared. Very impressive. Since it was a long week at work, I ordered a glass of Riesling. She allowed me to try a sip before ordering the whole glass. For entrees, we ordered the pork belly skewers, shishito peppers, loaded potato and charred octopus. My favorite was definitely the pork belly skewers. It was well seasoned and the pork was very tender. Shishito peppers was not spicy at all and a bit too mushy. I wouldn't recommend it. Loaded potatoes were soaked in flavor. The charred octopus was also well seasoned, favorable and so tender that you can cut it into a half with the folk. I highly recommend this dish. For dessert, we ordered the mini churros with 3 different types of dipping sauce. Chocolate dipping was definitely my favorite. Raspberry was a bit soar and not for my taste. \n\nOur waitress was just great! She was attentive and constantly keeping an eye on our table to make sure that we are well taking care of. She was funny too. The bar is very decorated and staffs were all well dressed. I will most definitely come back here again with friends. \n\nP.S. This restaurant does not take reservation. Since it isn't a big restaurant, you might need to have an expectation of some wait time for tables during the weekends.
