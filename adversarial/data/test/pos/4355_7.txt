If I could give a negative rating I would.  We ordered a spa on 3\/26\/2015. We still don't have it. It appears Paddock\/Next Gen stole the money blamed it on the \"other guy.\" I went into the store to speak to Carole Myers the CFO and was told she was not available. Kathy came out to talk to me and only once I would not believe or listen to the BS did Carole appear.  SO they just lied, again. \n\nThey are making no attempts to correct the situation.  Carole didn't return my phone calls or my email.  That's not how you treat a customer.  When I asked at the end of the day will I get a hot tub or my money back and she said she didn't know. \n\nShe told me there was a criminal case against the other guy but couldn't provide the name of an attorney or a law enforcement entity. Then I read all these other reviews of people giving money and not getting their product in return and I totally believe Paddock Pools has stolen my money.  \n\nShame on them.
