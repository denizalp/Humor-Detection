RACIST SERVERS\n\nI was just there Thursday Sept 5 at 9:30pm for a late dinner with a friend and I am not impressed with their service. We were promptly seated but just left alone with no service. We weren't even asked if would like some drinks to start off with or given any water. 30 minutes after being seated, my friend and I decided to try and flag down a waitress so we could get our order taken down. Most times I tried, the waitresses just ignored me like I didn't even exist. I am absolutely sure they made eye contact and acknowledged my existence but simply chose not to take our order. They would just be standing near the kitchen talking with each other. The most infuriating part of my dining experience tonight was the fact that another table that was seated around 20 minutes after us got their food before we even got an order taken!\n\nAround 40 minutes into our dining experience there, my friend and I decided to just leave because we were still being ignored and go to the Jack Astors at Scarborough Town Centre instead. At Jack Astors, the waiter that served us was much better in terms of service and friendlier. It was such a stark contrast in attitude and we were so satisfied that we ended up leaving a very big tip. Who knows, maybe the reason why the waitresses ignored us was because it was a table of two asian girls and they were racist. \n\nLong story short, go somewhere else for food. You'll get much better service, won't have to deal with possibly racist servers and will not be ignored for 40 minutes. Also it was bad enough that I felt the need make an account to actually leave a review.
