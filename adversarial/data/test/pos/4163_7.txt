I frequent this place pretty often, more so back in football season. The TVs at Kickstand are not unlike a Best Buy show floor and the beer selection isn't too bad. Try to grab a booth seat near the entrance as it comes with your own personal HDTV in the booth.\n\nAs for the menu, there's a lot of burger options. I would suggest trying the veggie burger (which is more of a black bean burger) loaded with guac, tomato, and a chipotle sour cream...very on point. I usually go with tater tots for a side too. Fried pickles are a nice appetizer option here as well. They use a nice crunchy batter, but can be a bit thin at times. Still worth checking out...
