Great historical site. \nTour of the house was very educational. \nHouse of course is beautiful. \nWe ate in the restaurant. Limited lunch menu. \nOur table ordered Shaved prime rib sandwich. DELICIOUS! Cowboy chicken club. Very big sandwich and super tasty. And Nana had the spinach salad. To which she felt it was one of the best she had eaten. \nWe had a very nice afternoon at the Lougheed House. \nI think Calgarians should go at least once to learn our history and financially support this historical building.  \nI plan to go back during the Christmas season to see the house all decorated for the season.
