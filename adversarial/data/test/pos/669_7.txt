SHOUT OUT TO THE LADY WHO WORKS HERE. A FIVE FOOT TALL ANGEL. I wish I had gotten her name but she saved my mom and I from a very scary situation. After walking in the store we quickly realized the sketchiest f*ck was following us. He chased us around the store so we ran to the check out through a line of people. He began aggressively pushing people to the side to get to us. In comes angel lady who grabbed us and shoved us behind the counter. She called for security and firmly asked for him to leave. He had so much anger in his eyes don't know what the f would of happened if she wasn't there. She was so fierce and kept us calm while security came. I love you tiny hero lady you deserve a medal thank you SO MUCH FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.
