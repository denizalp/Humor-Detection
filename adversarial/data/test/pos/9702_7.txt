SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT TO IMPERIAL PALACE.  This is definitely not the old, rundown hotel.  \n\nCheck in is on kiosks.  Check out is through text.  No interaction with staff.  It was amazing.  I'm a fan.\n\nRooms were really nice and modern and a decent size.  The gym is also nice - all of the treadmills and ellipticals have screens on them, so you can watch TV, YouTube, play games, or even surf Facebook (but it was really slow).  They also provide refrigerated towels to cool you off with.\n\nLocation is awesome.  Smack dab in the middle of the Strip.  Right outside are delicious eats like Gordon Ramsey's Fish and Chips and In-and-Out.\n\nPrice is also decent for this place (I think it's usually always one of the cheaper options on the Strip).  It's worth it!  But remember, they add a $30-40\/day resort fee....
