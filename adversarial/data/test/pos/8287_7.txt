This place is a shit hole; it was one before they put lipstick on the pig and it is one now. After vowing not to come back in Baseline crap hole a couple of years ago due to horrible service and mediocre food, not to mention barfly midday drunks that call this place home evidently. Noticed a name  change and decided to give this \"new\" place a shot. Walked into a basically dead environment with a couple of deadbeat drunks at the bar.  Seat yourself, grabbed menu from adjoining table to notice it said Baseline crap hole on front...nothing changed, how cheap and typical of this place.  Sat and watched what I suppose was a female \"bartender\" only focused on the couple of drinks at the bar. Over 10 minutes went by with no acknowledgement, so left this outhouse and will never return.  Caught the tail end of Bar Rescue tonight and after seeing what I guess is the owner, I learned all I need to know.  This place will be out of business hopefully before football season can try to save it.
