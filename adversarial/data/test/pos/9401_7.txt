I don't even know where to start. I come in there to trade my gun, I am given one price at their \"gun library\" only to get a print out certificate on another lower price - it was only $15 less so I didnt make a fuss I just accepted it.\n\nI went to go look at gun's and let me just say they love to rush you to buy a gun and not give you any time because they want to get to the next person ASAP. I finally picked out a Gun and i said i want that one, i get some paperwork to fill thinking this dude is taking care of everything including the ammo i wanted for it. I get taken to a computer screen where they want me to fill out more info, I passed all the checks needed. \n\nNow when i tendered the trade in certificate, i was told i will get an additional $20 for using it as store credit and not cashing out - not the case as no one knew what i was talking about and made me look like i was trying to get one over, the dude who told me that then said he made a mistake.\n\nI get home - i got a gun i did not pick and i was livid at the service firstly but then this - I close the box, never fired the gun, its still wrapped. I called and they pretty much told me \"never time don't fall for pressure tactics and check everything\" - WOW.\n\nNever again - if you go there, check everything and take their word for nothing. I worked my ass off to save, traded in a gun that i kinda liked for a gun i have zero interest in and they won't even look at me to exchange it for what i wanted.\n\nHere is the funny part - that gun they gave me was on sale and they kept on trying to push it on me over and over and over and telling me that he swears his life by it and i should get it - i told him no 3 times. Screw that place.
