Went here specifically for the Dim Sum, since the ones I've been going to in Charlotte are just mediocre at best. I had been told that the service can be a hit or a miss, but I got lucky this time. The service was excellent and I was excited to eat when we were seated.\n\nThe restaurant's interior decor is quite pleasing. There isn't too much tacky Asian art and is kept simple and clean. Enough table space for large groups or even large parties in their back section. \n\nWe were seated fairly quickly for it to be a weekend and the carts started pushing our way. They have the usual Dim Sum flare that you can expect if you've ever had it and know what you're talking about. I'm Chinese, so I think I got that area covered. Their shaomai was a little dry for my taste. Their shrimp dumplings, cheong fan (rice noodle), and steamed buns weren't too bad though. They gave a lot for the price and compared to some of the other places in Charlotte which have been cutting back in quantity and quality, it was a nice change of pace. Service throughout was steady and I was thoroughly full by the time we asked for the check. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the quality of the Dim Sum restaurants in Charlotte lately, so going here revived that. I honestly thought the city lacked any good places to get my crave fulfilled, but alas, we have a place now. Let's see how long it will last though. I gave it four stars for being good in quality, price, and service. It wasn't the greatest Dim Sum I've had, but for the City of Charlotte it's one of the best.
