Holy cow, what a find! I'm a native New Yorker, so I carry with me the impression that all the great art is only in New York (and some of it is in Washington). It's always awesome to find that I'm wrong, but I've not been more wrong than this! Cleveland has an AWESOME collection of art going on here. Someone said that they're the sixth best museum in the United States and I can see why they would rank it this high.\n\nI prefer the more modern (but not \"contemporary\") art and the Cleveland MOA has this and more. Van Goghs, Rembrandt, Picasso, Tissot and more. There's even Bierstadt, O'Keeffe and Warhol here. Oh, and in case you thought it was all about the paintings, there was a display of Faberge eggs and Tiffany lamps. Wow!\n\nDid I mention that it's completely FREE?\n\nMy socks have been appropriately blown off.
