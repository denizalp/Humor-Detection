A Better Burger \n\nSmashburger is a good choice if your looking to  have a casual lunch that is  reasonably priced. \n\nSmashburger offers a variety of burgers from which to choose, including build-your-own options. Smashburger has a variety of unique  side dishes, to compliment your burger.  In addition to the traditional fries offered at most burger places, Smashburger offers sweet potato fries, smashfries tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, haystack onions, deep fried pickles, and veggie frites which are flash-fried carrot sticks, green beans and asparagus.\n\nThe service is pleasant, the ingredients are fresh and the food is cooked to order; if you're familiar with either In-N-Out Burger or Five Guys Burgers, the food here is arguably of similar caliber.
