I'm not sure what I expected, but woooooow was this show incredible. My friends and I have been joking about going to a Thunder From Down Under show for years. We finally turned that talk into reality for my bachelorette party this past weekend and now I don't know what took us so long! I was there with about 15 other girls and every single one of us were absolutely thrilled with the show. \n\nA big part of our enjoyment came from the location of our seats. My sister (the bachelorette party planner extraordinaire) called ahead months in advance to make sure we got the best seats in the house. The extremely helpful ticket sales lady placed us at table 12, which turned out to be the best table in the room, hands down. It's not right against the stage, which you might think would be the best position, but is right in the middle directly in front of the stairs coming down the stairs. It is the only table that every single one of the men walk across and dance on top of. Most of the other table got at least one guy at one point, but we honestly had every single guy on top of our table at one point. I'm sure it goes without saying that we were very excited about that. \n\nThere were quite a few bachelorettes there that night, which seems typical for a weekend. Therefore, just wearing a veil or tiara isn't always going to be enough to get you onstage. Luckily, I was with a group of adorable ladies who where super into the show, cheering and screaming the whole time. This really drew attention to us, and I was pulled up on stage TWICE, which I'm sure made some of the other bachelorettes hate us since they weren't pulled up at all, but I'm certainly not complaining. So, if you want to get pulled up, make sure you cheer and really get into the show. It's worth it, too! I'm still recovering from my sexy lap dance in a spinning office chair. DAMN. (Don't tell my fiance! :D)  The MC let us know when the show started that we could touch the guys as much as we wanted! I didn't expect that! The guys were super playful fun about it. They touched right back! \n\nThey didn't allow pictures or video for most of the show, but there was one song (one LONG song!) where they told us we could take pictures and record as much as we wanted! That seems to be new since my friends who had gone before said they didn't get that opportunity, plus a lot of these reviews seem to be complaining about lack of pictures. It was a great idea! It gave us plenty of pictures to remember the show by, even those of us who didn't feel like paying $20 to take a picture with the guys after the show. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this show for a girl's night out. It's fairly raunchy (some girls were there with their mothers and mother-in-laws! I don't know why you would do that!), but there's not full nudity. Just g-strings :) It's cheesy and silly and completely amazing when you need to let loose and enjoy yourself. So glad we went!
