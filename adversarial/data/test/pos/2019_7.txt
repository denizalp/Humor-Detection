Love it!  So this past weekend was the grand-opening and no I wasn't going to pay $200 at the door to see Kaskade on Sunday of MDW, but I was able to check it out the following day (Monday) and boy oh boy. I LOVE this place!  \n\n-Location, location, location! The Beach Club is right next to the parking structure (park at level 2 Wynn parking structure and walk across the pedestrian bridge, you hit the Beach club).  Always great, unlike some other pools where you gotta walk through the whole casino with people staring at you.  \n\n-Organized lines and guestlist was a breeze. No BS clusterfawks. Get in a single line, ID is checked (strictly btw) and the clipboard guy will ask you if you're on glist.  If so, he'll check you off, if you aren't on guestlist, veer right to the box office and pay the fee.  The guestlist line was a breeze btw.  Once entering, they do a bag check and then you're in there like swimwear.  Get there early because it can get really crowded if you wanna lay out at the edge of the pool.\n\n-Food and Drinks: They have a grill window where you can pick up some sandwiches among other food items.  There are 2 bars (and the main bar has a gambling area for you to play if you get a little bored).\nMojitos were $15 while the pitcher ran you about $85.  Overall deelish! \n\n-Music was mainly mainstream vocal house for the majority of the time. When 4ish hit, they did a bit of mashup and top 40 music. Sound system is pretty nice as well! \n\n-Bonuses:\nThey also have 2 \"stripper\" poles on the side of each pool with a little bit of running water for you to act a fool (or not!)\nThey have a small private glass vip pool where they fill it up with ice if you so happen to be lucky and get a nice (and I mean NICE cabana).\n\nService: The staff is definitely friendly and fun.  They're very accommodating and always aim to please and there are plenty of people to squeegee the area to make sure no one slips and also your drink cups\/cans are promptly taken away by any staff member once they realize you're done.\n\nIn the 4 hours I was there, I saw 3 people get pulled out in wheel chairs, boy does this place come prepared!\n\nPics will be posted soon - once I recover!
