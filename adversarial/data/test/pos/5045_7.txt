What a magnificent dive bar!  It's DIVE-ine! I can't even believe something this amazing actually exists on the Las Vegas strip! We came here after spending all day at a major casino trying to find a cocktail waitress or get someones attention. All of our day and all of our money went to the strip and we were still stone cold sober. I checked Yelp trying to find a way to salvage the night and the Stage Door was it! \n\nDrinks were so cheap I kept waiting for someone to try selling us a timeshare, but this place is FOR REAL, you guys. Yes, it stinks like smoke. And yes there are some questionable people hanging around in there, but there comes a time in life where you really have to decide if you would prefer to be treated badly at some classy joint, or treated awesomely in a smokey dive. \n\nAt the very least this is a great place to pre-game for strip activities. Anyway, if you're too classy for people who wear jeans and smoke then feel free to continue paying $27 for a drink on the strip.
