I love the decorations here, it looks great for a hot pot place and its very nice and clean, definitely not what you would think the inside would look like judging from the name of this place. We had all you can eat hot pot and I really like how they give us many sauces to create our own sauce from it and you can even ask for raw eggs to create your masterpiece! \n\nThe price for AYCE hot pot is great! We were very very full! selection is not the best, but it is still good selection! and The meat is fresh (as in frozen and not defrosted and mushy) I like the handmade fish balls and there is a seafood platter when you start, also a man came around with a few special dishes (i guess these are limited depending on the day) and I opted for the dish with salmon head in it. I love salmon head haha, usually grilled at Japanese restaurants but it still tastes good hot pot also.
