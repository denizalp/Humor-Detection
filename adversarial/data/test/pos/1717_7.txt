Went back for another spray tan for a wedding...lemme just say, well, I've gained some weight since my last visit. I was quite self-concious exposing my nakedness & translucent skin-tone to anyone other than my man.  Spray-boy made me squeel like a pig laughing the whole session, he made me feel so comfortable!   \n\nGreat place, awesome spray-dude! I heart him!
