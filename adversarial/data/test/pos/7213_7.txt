The Coronado: \n\nIf Carnivores talked like Vegans: \n\n\"Do you know that carrot was alive at one time?\"\n\n\"Do you know how many fields died for that salad?\"\n\n\"Did you know that everyday thousands of watermelon's are taken from away from their mothers & their field?!l\n\n-- insert air of hostility--\n\n\"This cabbage died just so you could be Vegan.\"\n\n\"Is that broccoli Farm raised, cage free?\"\n\nJust a point though; you don't see carnivores at a steak house like: \"can you make this steak taste like lettuce?\"\n\nJust sayin'. \n\nLook, all joking aside, I know I'll catch flack for this but to hell with it, what elevates Us above the tiers of the animal kingdom is the ability to laugh, and laugh at ourselves. \n\nDon't take life to seriously, you'll never get outta here alive. \n\nTruth is, I'm no stranger to\nplant-based meal plans & I've been a Coronado Fan-Girl (#Vagitarian) for a little over a while. \n\nTheir Facebook, their Social Media--I can only describe it as a Campaign against ignorance. \n\nAll I can say is: commendable...beyond admiration. \n\nIn the end, I'll leave you with this fact: the term 'Vegan', is an archaic Word from the Olmec translation for 'Bad Hunter'. \n\n;-)\n\nI loved the vibe of this place. It's like an Oregon house Wizard Of Oz'ed down to A-Hell-I-Zona. \n\nWhether you're a carnivore or or a Vagitarian--you are what you eat, all pun intended--I recommend you try Coronado. \n\nExpand your mind, and if you don't like it, fine. All the more for me. \n\nBest part for me is the family. I grew up without one and from watching the crew you could tell there was a lot of family in this old house. \n\nTo me, that's the best history\/memories. You can't count that, you can't pay for that many Smiles.
