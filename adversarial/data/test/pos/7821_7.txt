Ok, I really wanted to love this place.  Close to home and prices are decent.  It was on a Sunday morning.  It was gloomy, wind, and cold.  I NEEDED to get my toe did!  I signed in and was greeted by Tracy.  It was told to go check out the colors.  She got me a chair set up and told me to sit down.  They were pretty busy but a customer there brought her mom and 2 kids (1 toddler and 1 young kid).  The toddler was walking around everywhere and screaming.  The young kid was all over the shop and falling on the floor.  It just made my relaxing time not so relaxing.  =(  \n\nThe service was good, the french pedicure looks good, the place is nice and new.  Just the screaming and running kids was distracting.  So this is a 3-1\/2 stars.
