Despite growing up as a bit of a tomboy, I still love to dress up from time to time. Bad Attitude Boutique is my go to spot when I need something amazing and sexy to wear for a special occasion. \nThere is so much fun stuff here... hot shoes, adorable skirts, full blown Halloween costumes and some amazing corsets, all at decent prices. Good quality merchandise is rarely cheap, and these are good quality corsets. I don't think I have ever left without something, be it a pair of glittery high heels or fabulous fake eyelashes.\n\nNo bad attitudes with the employees here, service has always been spot on, friendly and helpful but never pushy. I am not sure what I am going to be for Halloween this year, but I know I will be going to Bad Attitude to shop when I figure it out!
