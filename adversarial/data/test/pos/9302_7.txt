I agree with Catherine J. Completely!\n\nIn my opinion there is no place in REAL yoga for sushi bar and 1\/2 bottles of wine - consistent sales pitch by his instructors after each and every class is very annoying.\n\nThis NEW Y2 is still very cramped and crowded, especially when trying to get in and upstairs because of the still too narrow hall way that is also the gift shop, and way too commercial and up tight and haughty front desk people in my opinion for what it is...it is not a Beverly Hills Spa, certainly not even close. Very pretentious. \n\nWhat I've observed, Y2 still is NOT doing the cleaning job needed for my standards of good hygiene. Floors are sticky. I've seen no cleaning of the floors, I've seen the instructor just pushing the goo around with a mop - I try to stay on my mat to avoid the floor, the wet body goo that's not mine on the floor I can't help but roll around in while doing yoga, yuck. Kind of disgusting.\n\nIn each class I've been in, all the instructors play music that is totally unrelated to yoga, not  the quiet moment music I's suggest, they choose banging piano music, and it is really way too loud for my taste or for a yoga class and more importantly for my ability to hear what the instructor is saying. The kind of music played in class sucks most the time, in my opinion.\n\nAs for the instructors, I've had much better and worst in my life time, I've been to Pune, India too. But Joey is the shining star stand out. If you're not too worried about maybe catching something from the goo on the floor, take his LSD class. For me, It was hit or miss with the other instructors. They were not very consistent with LSD content - it is suppose to be SLOW. But Joey was. There was one instructor (who was late) that confused straight shot with LSD. She was way off course for the LSD class description. I left this class, way too fast. Not everyone wants to do fast GYM yoga. LSD is a slow deep stretch, holding poses for 3-10 minutes at least that is what we did with Joey. Joey is fantastic. Five stars for Joey!\n\nFor me, Joey\/LSD is the ONLY good thing about Y2. I took a straight shot class, and I had to leave immediately because the instructor really was going tooo darn fast. But I observed through the glass doors, most Y2 classes are GYM yoga, too fast and too highly energetic for my taste.\n\nin my opinion, Y2 is anathema to the way yoga could be experienced.\n\nHow in the world can someone get the full benefit of a yoga pose when they're only in the pose for not even one second? They can't. I know most of the people in the Y2 classes are young and hopefully resilient, and more important don't know how to set a yoga pose properly and safely, so all the more reason the instructor's focus is to go SLOW do a pose correctly and really much much slower and more emphatic for the pose to be effective and also for the purpose of safety. \"The goal of yoga is to calm the chaos\" not create more. BKS Iyengar's opinion.\n\nSo, YES! There are many other much BETTER established yoga places in Charlotte that adhere to what I think yoga is all \"about\" and much better in terms of atmosphere, attitude, mindset that are definitely far less commercial uptight and haughty.\n\nThere are places in Charlotte where a person can learn the correct and proper way to set yoga poses for the holistic full benefit, rather than someone who wants to move fast, get their heart rate up, sweat all over the floor - get their daily exercise on.\n\nY2 is not for everyone. there are less expensive places for walk ins. Compared to what I've experienced and well beyond my personal taste for a lot of reasons but mostly beyond the pale for marketing something that is NOT REAL yoga\n\nIn my opinion, Y2 offers a trendy expensive exercise (GYM YOGA) for lower middle class millennials and it has almost nothing to do with a REAL yoga practice.\n\nNote:\nHolding a pose is one of THE most important parts of yoga. The holding gives space for emotions to emerge and helps me feel grounded, and creates an anchor for the soul.\n\nIn my opinion and that of BKS Iyengar, when a person zooms\/flies fast through postures, without holding, then all you really have to show for it is sweat and soul less exercise.
