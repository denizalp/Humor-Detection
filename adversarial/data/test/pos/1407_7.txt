I have been remiss in reviewing Dorothy 6, shame on me! I love the idea of it, the concept is good but not fully executed, which is unfortunate because this place has what it takes to be really special. They have a nice selection of beers and do flights for your tasting pleasure, and my sandwich was quite satisfying, with a good price point for the quality of food, service, and the area. Our party had a young child and the staff was totally cool. Overall good time, it just left me feeling it was missing that last key to the 5 star puzzle.  I'd give them 4 and a half, but there are no halves.
