We had been waiting in anticipation of our dinner here with our 3 children. When we arrived the host was nice and talked a little with our son and gave him glow sticks to share with his 2 sisters. \nWe were sat down and the first thing I noticed is how loud it was in the dining area. We were in the corner \"Ali\" booth and I had a hard time conversing across the table. \nThe wine menu was on the higher end of price but a decent selection. My husband and I enjoyed wine yet the children were not offered anything other than water. \nI had a petite filet and quite honestly it was not that amazing for $40. It was cooked to perfection but didn't have much for flavor. Even the juices were bland and lacking. ( My 2 younger children ordered the 12 oz filet and shared it and my older daughter had the petite and they were just as underwhelmed. ) \nOur sides that we ordered were the \"whipped potatoes\", broccoli and asparagus. The potatoes were obviously russet and thinned out with cream\/ milk. They were runny and lacked much for flavor. The asparagus was ok but the broccoli was woody and tough. \nTime for desserts... hard to mess them up. My husband and I had a port. My children ordered cheese cake, Creme Brule, and tiramisu. My son devoured the cheese cake so we assume it was good. The creme Brule was different... it was dark brown  but taste ok. Not great but not horrid. My other daughter waited patiently for her tiramisu to come out and when it finally did she anxiously put her fork to the desert only to find it frozen solid! We got the attention of the staff and he apologized quietly and took it away. He assured us it would be taken off the bill. Nothing else was offered. \nWhen it was time to pay the bill the staff was quick to point out the \"tipping chart\" at the bottom of the bill. We eat out often with our 3 children, often at nicer establishments, and this was a complete turn off. It isn't like our children are naughty or making a mess. They are 10,12,14! They sat with just as many,if not more, manners than many adults.\nWill we be back? No most likely not. It is great for the tourist who wants to be where the \"greats\" have been. I personally think that for the $350 I would rather eat at Hugo's Cellar at Four Queens or The Steak House at Circus Circus.
