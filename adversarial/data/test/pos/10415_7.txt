I ordered a ham and turkey breast for thanksgiving. I arrived the day before thanksgiving and there was a line out the door. The staff were working super hard and even though there were 70 people ahead of me, the line went fast and within 20 minutes I had paid and was out the door. \n\nIn the future, I am told the smart move is to pickup your ham and turkey on Tuesday before thanksgiving.  Either way, you will be purchasing very delicious ham and turkey- and your guests will lift you up on their shoulders and cheer for you after they eat their meal.
