This company review received one star because I was unable to leave a review with no stars. I normally wait until my stay in a hotel is over prior to making a review... BUT due to the terrible service a first day review was deemed necessary. My trip here at the MGM was supposed to start at 10:30 am and go until the check out time on Monday the 30th. I told my boyfriend MULTIPLE times I hadn't heard good reviews about this hotel and was very nervous to stay but he was 100% behind them and so we decided to stay here. We now are both on the same page, the service and expectations were not met. \n\nSo to start we arrived at 10 am this morning, knowing we would have to wait a little because it seemed to be busy, we patiently waited. There was no support when we pulled up with bags and had to look for the carts ourselves (after waiting for 15 minutes)... After that frustration ended we went to check in in person and they said only ONE of our three rooms was available (even after we paid for early check in). We decided to remain calm cool and collected and get some errands done and come back in an hour like they asked. We returned and still our rooms were NOT READY. Along with that the suite we paid for was downgraded because although we reserved a suite there wasn't one available any longer which no one informed us of prior. THIS IS A HUGE DOWNSIDE for us because we're here for a bachelor\/bachelorette party and this room is where they are staying as well. \n\nAfter keeping busy and waiting for a text to notify us about our room being ready like the staff said would happen.... It got to be about 4:20 pm and we were exhausted (we started travelling today at 3 am) and we STILL hadn't heard anything. We had to ask staff a 3rd time, and they were able to finally give a room which ended up being a standard room which was extremely disappointing but at this point a room is a room. I am livid with this experience and really hope this hotel gives a better experience for the rest of this trip. I am not happy. If the rest of the trip is anything like today was this will be my first and ONLY stay at the MGM. I am so incredibly disappointed. \n\nALSO another HUGE downfall is as everything was going wrong with this experience the staff was rude.... Again I really hope this trip gets better here at the MGM.
