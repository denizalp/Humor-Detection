Terrible service and not a good experience at all.\n\nIt is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.\n\nFirst of all, we were asked, \"Still or sparkling?\" Thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. That was a $24 mistake. Although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.\n\nWhen ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me I needed to try their Kung Pau tofu dish. Although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, I was excited to try this off-menu item.  It ended up being too spicy for my taste and I switched meals with someone else.  Fast -forward to when the check came and I found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal I originally had picked out. Needless to say, I felt a little cheated.\n\nThe meal I did end up eating was good.... Vegan Pad Thai with Gluten free noodles. (Yes, it was also appreciated that they had GF options!)  we were also able to use their buy-one-get-one promotion for cocktails as it was happy hour. However, everyone at the table was really disappointed and rather indignant at the service that was given. \n\nThe cuisine was good but the experience was marred by the sub-par service and the costly extras.
