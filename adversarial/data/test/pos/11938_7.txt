Wow. Worst service.\n\nHey guys! My bad. Moved here from Edmonton recently and brought my bike in to your shop for some seasonal maintenance. I had no idea you had the rite to be sarcastic and insulting with regard to my bike because it isn't as nice and as cool and as expensive as yours. I'll just put away a few thousand dollars and invest in a bike I'll use 5-6 months out of the year because I'm only a casual cyclist. I really really apologize about that. Should have done my homework.\n\nI've tried really hard to maintain this bike I have and took it into my local cycle shop in Edmonton a few times a year for the last few years and never had any trouble. Now I know your standards are much higher than mine. Again I apologize. I'll go get a much better more expensive bike from any store but yours and I will NEVER EVER set foot in your shop again.\n\nNo word of a lie, the staff member I was talking to told me he would only do maintenance on a bike like mine if he was going to give it to his mom. Nice.
