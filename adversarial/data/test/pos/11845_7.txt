I was really excited to try this place! The name alone got me really excited. However, once I got there and tried the food the food was just OK. Nothing to write home about. But the point that really got to me was when rap music was playing overhead and the N-word kept coming up over and over again in various songs! Being an African-American it's hard for me to except that a place with play music like that that use the N-word. It was completely unacceptable and inappropriate. I also found that the food was way too expensive for what you would normally pay for tacos. I will not be going back! #HighlyOffended
