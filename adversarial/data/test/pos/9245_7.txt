3 stars according to Yelp means \"a-ok\", and that's exactly what this place was: okay. Just okay.\n\nFirst, a little background on why I'm reviewing this place: having recently moved to Cleveland, I've been on the hunt for good restaurants, hair salons, decent shopping, coffee, you name it.  To my disappointment though, it appears that Clevelanders are not as Yelp-heavy as what i'm used to. Which sucks for people like me who have become so reliant on Yelp! So, instead of what I usually do i.e. bitch about the lack of local Yelp reviews, and then leech off other peoples' reviews without contributing myself, I am going to Yelp the hell out of Cleveland!!!! YES.\n\nBattiste & Dupree, you are \"lucky\" #1 to be reviewed of Cleveland. And i'm sorry I couldn't give you 5 stars like all the other people on here (by the way, I don't really get why people are giving this place 5-as-good-as-it-gets-stars, when in reality, the majority of the 5-star reviews all caveat that the service is slow; If  there is even ANY area of opportunity, you probably didn't mean to give the place 5 stars, right??) *confused*\n\nLong story short, I agree with everyone else that the food here is delish. I had the fried tilapia with beans and rice, and the bf had the catfish. No question here, the food is good; very flavorful. The reason I had to knock off two stars though, is that the service here is SO overwhelmingly slow. Like, think TWO hours slow. I could freaking drive to Columbus for the amount of time I spent at this place.\n\nYes, I get that Battiste & Dupree is small, locally-owned and is a hole in the wall spot, and obviously i'm not expecting mind-blowing service at a hole in a wall...butttt let me just highlight that at Battiste & Dupree, you are NOT paying hole in the wall prices (think $40ish for 2 people for entrees only). The owner is a nice guy and means well, but they need to seriously hire some help -- it just doesn't make sense to have people wait that long to have their orders placed; for food and for water to wash down the spicy food. This place is literally a one-person show; the guy does everything from cooking, taking orders, checking on customers, ringing people up. As good as the food is, at $40 for a dinner, spending 2 hours at a hole in a wall spot is not exactly at the top of my priority list...sorry, I gave the place a chance but i'll have to pass! :(
