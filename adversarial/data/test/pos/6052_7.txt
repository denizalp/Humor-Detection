First time here since Dozo closed, and I find it just as good.  \"And I know good sushi,\" because I saw it on Food Network and my husband was stationed in Japan...before I ever met him.  Actually, I don't know sushi.  I just thought I would say it to see how it felt.  Not good.  \n\nIn fact, I'm not a sushi lover, and there was a time I wouldn't eat it at all.  But it's grown on me.  Although I've yet to graduate to sushi rolls with raw fish as the main ingredient, I have moved to where I can handle a little tuna as long as there's some other stuff in there to hide it.  But even this non-sushi eating diner finds some good things on the menu.  My favorite roll of the night was...well I can't remember the name of it and their website is down...I think it was the shy guy or something along those lines.  And with that, I conclude this exceptionally useful review.  I guess I should take better notes, or any notes for that matter.
