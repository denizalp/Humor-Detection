What a snazzy addition to a tired business building in Scottsdale! Before the arrival of Searsucker, I drove by this building on a daily basis and never gave it second thought. However, now everyday I drive by, it makes me want to stop into Searsucker because I am meow a fan!! \n\nFirst, I love the atmosphere. They completely opened up the ceiling with sky scrapers placed throughout the restaurant. In addition to the sky scrapers, trees grace floorboards which make it feel like an indoor garden. The furniture's modern and earthy which matches the fresh vibe. You can see the chefs making the food in the kitchen and an open bar area holds comfortable couches as well as high tops. It's very fresh and airy for being inside a corporate building! \n\nNow let's move on to the food, oh my the food! I can only review the lunch menu since I've only been for lunch, but if the dinner menu's anything like lunch, then I'm a fan. My two menu highlights are the Havarti turkey sandwich and the delectable chocolate caramel peanut bacon sundae! That might not be the correct name, but that's how I like to describe it! The Havarti Turkey sandwich has freshly roasted turkey with a cranberry jam, sprouts and fresh cracked wheat bread. It's accompanied by a salad and a perfectly fresh lunch. \n\nI enjoy a leisurely lunch at Searsucker and especially enjoy their delicious craft cocktails at night! \n\n**** Checklist: visit for weekend brunch soon!
