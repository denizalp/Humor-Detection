Currently staying at this hotel, and it's hard to imagine anyone rating this place higher than one or two stars. I've stayed at quite a few hotels on the strip, and this has to be the worst one (especially since they call themselves a 5 Star hotel- laughable). Just a couple things noticed about this hotel in where it's lacking in serious customer service. First off, they have a keurig in every room, but charge $5 for a paper cup sealed, filled with a keurig cup, sugar, and cream. It's cheaper to buy coffee at Starbucks, plus you don't have to do any work! It's not about the money, just about the fact that this is the only hotel that I have ever seen charge for in-room coffee. Next, they do not have wine openers available for in-room use. You have to buy a wine opener from the gift store. Another complaint- the towels are SO crappy. They seriously had a few holes in them, and were so thin. None of the staff members were spectacular or friendly at all. Last complaint (for the time being), the restaurant Della's kitchen charges $0.75 per person for WATER. I've never seen that before, even dayclubs and nightclubs give water for free! \nSo overall, 10\/10 would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Plus, it's super far from any major action on the strip. \nStay awayyyy
