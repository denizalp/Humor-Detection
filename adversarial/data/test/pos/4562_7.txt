The furnace and air conditioning units in my house are original. In 2017, that means that they are 23 years old, which is pretty ancient for such units. As they started to go, we started shopping around for replacements. Comfort Plus wasn't the cheapest but they were definitely the best. The sales folks who worked with us knew what they were doing and it was clear from the technical people who helped that they were experts in the field of HVAC.\n\nWhen it came time to do the install, they guys who arrived were polite, professional and efficient. They needed nothing from us, not even the bathroom. We did offer them some cold sodas which they accepted gratefully.\n\nWhen they were done, not only did the furnace and air conditioner work flawlessly and way quieter than the old units, but they had completely cleaned up. There was no packaging, no bits of plastic, no stripped wires. Perfect.\n\nFive stars for Comfort First!
