Lee Lee's is a staple for homesick Asians like me who get desperate for ethnic food fix.\n\nI am forever indebted to Lee Lee's for the fresh Vietnamese snacks and the Chinese pastries that I thought only existed in hella Asianized California, who woulda thunk?\n\nThe options are limitless here-- the produce is fresh and cheap, the aisles are fully stocked with anything and everything Asian related, and the lines are never long. \n\nLove it!
