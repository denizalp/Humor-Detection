We have been visiting this place for almost 10 years, as we live around the corner they know us well. The food here is great. There is nothing we have ordered that wasn't spectacular. From the pastas to the pizzas and everything in between they are the best on this side of town and our favorite pizza shop by far. However they previously raised the prices on all the pastas and it really made it too expensive to order any more so we completely stopped ordering their pasta. We always get thin crust with pepperoni, and man is it delicious. The carryout special is our go-to as it was the best value on their menu and one of the best pizza values in town, however they just raised the price on the carryout special, and its not such a deal for us anymore.. We are very sorry to say we will no longer be offering them our business. It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye, Lino's. You gave us many years of fond memories and great food, and we are sad to see that ending. Farewell.
