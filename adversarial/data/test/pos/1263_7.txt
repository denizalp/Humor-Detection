The funny thing about this Arby's, as well as the neighborhood it resides in, is that everything here feels like it comes out of a time warp set firmly in the 1970's-1990's.  And this Arby's is no different.\n\nThis place looks very old-school.  Old style logo, old-style restaurant and building with seating.  I normally don't make much note of a fast food design, but this place is decidedly retro.  Whether it was intentional, or just part of the aforementioned \"time warp\" effect, who can say?\n\nBut people don't want to come to a restaurant review page for architecture.  They want to know how the food is.  And the food here is actually pretty decent.    As I kid, it was a highlight for me to get Arby's when we went out of town, and now having one so close to home is really nice, considering the old love for the place.\n\nI've noticed that Arby's has been changing up their selections, adding some non-roast beef selections (fish sandwich, anyone?), but their sandwich fare are generally enjoyable. \n\nThe real perk for me has always been the Beef 'N' Cheddar.  I could probably eat four of those sammiches, and the food is done well here.  Not to mention the service is consistently dependable.  The staff is conversational and friendly, my orders have remained correct, and there never has been an outstandingly long line.\n\nIf there's a downside, Arby's has grown increasingly expensive over the years.  Just because you're getting fast food does not mean that you're getting cheap food.  Fortunately, Arby's coupons hit my mailbox with some regularity, so it's not an issue.  Still, I do miss the days of \"5 for $5\".\n\nRespectable food, decent service, and somewhat pricey.  That's the Arby's experience, alright.
