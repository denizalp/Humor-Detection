I used to have a very limited palette that consisted of hot dogs and alpha ghetti.  Thankfully, over the years, I've been influenced by people who were in touch with their tastebuds, and have since had the variety of food I eat expand. \n\nAll you have to do is say the word Ghandi and my mouth starts to water, not just for peace on earth, but for a piece of that roti.  oh yeah, i just said that. that's how good this roti is, it's worth one of my lame puns. \n\nseriously though. it will be the best decision you ever make.  After the first time you go, you'll want to call ahead so you don't have to wait, but I encourage your first visit to be a sit down experience.  Let the smell captivate your senses, increasing your eagerness to get your food with each passing second. \n\nThe portion is perfect for two meals, but you won't be able to stop eating it, so don't be ashamed.  My mouth is watering right now.\n\nI started with the Chicken Tikka Masala Roti, but have switched over to the Butter Chicken, medium spicy.   Go get one.
