Come here and eat seafood. Don't be stupid and get the regular Viet shit like pho or banh cuon. Sure, they have it, but it doesn't mean you should eat it! The reason you come here is for curry crab, and black pepper lobster, and oysters done up just right. Even the clams are good, very fresh. It's more of an \"every so often\" kinda place, cuz it's a bit expensive compared to other Viet places, but you won't be disappointed by the seafood. Be sure to get some roti with your seafood to sop up all that delicious sauce!
