The Mr and I stumbled on this nice wine bar while strolling down 5th Avenue.  It was quite warm outside and the sign was inviting us in for a glass of wine, so we decided we might as well grab a nice cold glass of white.  So glad we did! We had already eaten, so we just sat at the bar.  Nadine was the bartender and she was excellent! I love that they give everyone big jugs of water as well...so refreshing! We decided to try the Pine Ridge Voignier and it was perfect. We loved the feel and location of this place and the service was great.  Would love to return for brunch in the near future.
