I had a plumbing issue with a sewage smell coming into my house through the shower drain.  Service One Home Warranty sent this company out to troubleshoot.  The guy they sent (dark hair, surly) was rude, disrespectful and dishonest.  When he discovered that there was no easy access to the plumbing, he told me to pour bleach down the drain.  I told him that I was interested in RESOLVING the problem, not masking it.  He answered every question I posed to him with a shrug and an \"I don't know.\" and was very flippant.  He then went outside and called my warranty company and told them that everything was fine and there was no odor.  When he came in to have me sign the order form I refused because he misrepresented what he had done.  He just wanted to get his $55 service fee and leave.  Anyway, I eventually got the problem solved with a different company but had to pay ANOTHER service fee for them to come out.  Don't patronize these jerks.
