Organ Stop Pizza - A Favorite for Young & Old Alike!\n\nWhile I am not the biggest fan of Organ Stop, I do find it somewhat entertaining.  It is always fun to watch the young ones sing along and dance to the music!  However, many times it's the Seniors that have the most fun!  I am not sure why, but Senior Citizens love this place (so you might not want to come early)!  I honestly think they shuttle seniors in, there are that many...\n\nThe pizza is okay, though I like pretty much all pizza!  If you are in the area, or have kids or grandparents, give it a try!\n\nCheers!
