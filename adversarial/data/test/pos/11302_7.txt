Say what???\n\nHow cool is this tiny spot?  It is small but large in the fun you will have when you experience this place. We mostly hung outside while getting our beer goggles on and you can't beat the bright christmas lights that suck you in.\n\nDivey and really makes up for the douchey places in Scottsdale.  \n\nOne thing I must say...a dude crop dusted the whole bar.  It made for an interesting scene as people slowly backed away from the bar, looking away from each other as if making contact would seem as they may be guilty.  The small confined place compacted the smell, which made us more keen on drinking outside.
