I hate house music but I love Marquee's hip-hop room even though it can get insanely crowded. It's my safe haven away from the \"noise\" downstairs.\n\nLast time I was there, they passed out slippers to all the ladies at the end of the night which fit PERFECTLY! It was funny watching all the ladies snatch it from the worker handing them out. Poor guy. I was one of them haha.. .GIMME THAT!!
