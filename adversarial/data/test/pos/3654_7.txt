Let me begin by saying the only reason the company is getting one star is because of the rating system has a minimum of one star. I have had a number of inspections with this company and unfortunately have had to treat a home with termites when the housemaster termite inspection said the home had termites. It turns out they gave us the incorrect report. While they admitted their wrong doing, they did nothing to repair it. There have been many situations that other inspectors have stated that the owner\/lead inspector is not competent. I realized that myself when there were pictures we received in an inspection report with pictures of a completely different home. The owner is the husband of Wendy Rogers Kunnen who is running for Congress. Well that explains the business ethic. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Before my review they had only 3 stars.. So my situation is not unique. Obviously this is a trend with this company.
