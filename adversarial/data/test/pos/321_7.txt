Have you ever been so excited to go somewhere because you have heard and read such great things about it?  Well, a visit to Schwartz's Deli was #1 on my restaurant priority list for our Montreal trip.  As expected, the place was packed when we arrived for dinner.  Fortunately, we only had to wait outside for 10 minutes before getting seated.\n\nEnjoyed the ambiance of the deli.  Impressive how things appear chaotic with all the people milling around everywhere.  Staff makes the chaos disappear because they are very fast and efficient.  Food comes out quickly.\n\nOrdered the Smoked Meat sandwich.  The smoked meat was flavorful.  Plenty of meat inside the sandwich.  Was not too crazy about the Rye bread that it came on.  \n\nOverall, I found Schwartz's to be good.  There was no \"WOW\" factor though.  Perhaps my expectations were too sky high??  \n\nDo I recommend making a stop here when in Montreal?  Absolutely!!  They are a Montreal institution and landmark!!  You never know who you might find here!
