Be careful!   These people are your best friends when your staying here, but sure enough when it comes time to leave you better be prepared.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I leased an apartment here for 6 months from August of 2010 until early March of 2011 (we ended up staying an extra month as we overlooked our 30 day notice and had to submit one a bit late and stay the extra time).  \n\nNearly a year later and my girlfriend decided to give them a call as she was in the market for an apartment in the area again, come to find out they are now claiming that not only did we not give them a 30 day notice (we had to stay an extra month to do so but absolutely did!), they are now claiming we also didn't give a final walkthrough (we actually did two to make sure the place was spotless!).     \n\nAll said and done they now claim we owe over $900 in expenses for not giving a final walkthrough and 30 day notice.  \n\nThe management for these places are crooks!\n\nEdit*  Also strangely enough, this is the only existing yelp listing for this building when I'm positive there was another low rated one at some point....
