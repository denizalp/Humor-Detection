The three times I've tried to come here while living in AZ, the place was closed. No, I'm not coming at 4am, I'm simply coming during normal business hours! Not even 9am - I'm talking 11am, 3pm, 4pm. Wonderful!\n\nI couldn't give a crap what happened on that TV show, I simply wanted to see if their food was good. But alas, I couldn't do that because they were never open without any notice. I don't want to waste my time or money on a spot that can't even simply put a note on the door if they need to be closed in an unlikely situation.
