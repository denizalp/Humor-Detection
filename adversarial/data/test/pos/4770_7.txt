I love this local production! It just gets better and better every year!!\n$12 admission, $25 for VIP.\n\nLocated just behind Chilly Bombers this year.\n\nEach year, I scream my head off in fright! Its hard to remember the actors arent really in danger! \n\nI like that its a dark maze, with horrific evil lurking about. I prefer this to the more family friendly attractions in town, although there is a family friendly hour for children or those seeking a less intense experience.\n\nThis year it was even creepier for the regular show!! Glad I escaped...
