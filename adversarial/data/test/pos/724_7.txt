My disclaimer is that I'm not a fan of Asian fusion restaurants.  I only go to them as a last resort.\n\nSpring Rolls is one of those restaurants that, I, being of Chinese descent, would deem as a \"Chinese\" restaurant that makes westernized Chinese food to tailor to westerners.  To me, it is just a better-decorated Manchu Wok.\n\nThey are extremely overpriced for what they are offering (you could get authentic Chinese dishes for half of what they're charging).  \n\nService was invisible as the servers trotted about at a snail's pace, and seemed to disappear at random intervals.  We had to wait to have our orders taken, and then wait to get the bill.\n\nThe food itself was not even what I would call average - its mediocre.  With the St. Lawrence Market just a few steps away, why eat here?
