This was my first time walking into a Henry's of any kind, let alone going to one for a class - yes your read that correctly, a class! I recently purchased a Nikon D5600 using my Aeroplan points (score) only to realise that, outside of Auto mode and trying desperately to use the Scene function to make my pictures look like Instagram gems, I hadn't a foggy on how to operate this piece of machinery.\n\nI got word that Henry's offered classes for everything from learning about your specific brand of camera (Nikon and Canon primarily) to basic 101 shooting to more advanced classes that help you gain more and more control of your camera while subsequently becoming more artsy.\n\nI took the Nikon 101 class for beginners to help me learn about my brand of camera as well as some basics a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday morning. The class was scheduled for about 2.5-3 hours start to finish. I was a little aprehenisve because I typically don't do very well in classroom learning settings (stupid ADHD) but the class was so interactive, the instruction concise and digestable and the content easy to follow along that before I realised it the 3 hours had passed.\n\nOur instructor was excellent as well, I forget his first name but his last name was Ogilvie :)\n\nFull marks on the classes and eventhough I didn't shop at the store, I did walk around and it is a real beaut. Brand new, having moved from it's old location literally 50 feet away around the corner ON Queen East. Lots of staff on hand as well as sales happening. What I found even nicer still was the free coffee station they had with Tim Hortons coffee for any customer to enjoy.\n\nI anticipate a foray into photography to be a potentially expensive one but seeing the level of expertise and support offered here at this location I'm comfortable that these are the people to help me make the most educated decisions
