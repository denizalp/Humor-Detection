Lots of bells and whistles, not all necessary. All the X-rays and photos of my teeth took forever and were torture. My cleaning was pretty painful. \n\nThey were very careful and sweet w my son. \n\nI don't feel what they prescribed was necessary. \n\nMy husband had a horrible experience w them so we won't be back.
