At the Charlotte airport, en route to a connecting flight, I wondered which route might allow me to quickly satisfy a sudden caffeine itch.  So I walked up to a goodwill ambassador named Dottie. \n\nI've always admired the airport goodwill ambassadors, or courtesy hosts.  I remember seeing the guys and gals in Denver with the cowboy hats and western glow in their faces... and tags that read \"volunteers\".  Volunteers!  Gotta love folks like that.  They just stone-cold love their city that much, and want to share their enthusiasm.  Sometimes I look at them, and their eager faces, as they scan for someone who might want to know why the Rockies are wonderful or why Colorado is a great place to send your kid to study minerology, and I see them identify a potential convert but then watch them walk by, and I think how sad it is when someone full of love wants to share it and is not granted the chance.  [I know, it's kind of a bit much that I read the sometimes-sadness of the human condition in the gazes of a Stetson-bedecked airport welcoming committee.  But still.  You get me.]\n\nBack to Dottie...  \n\nI approached her.  She identified me as an in-bound inquiry on the verge of happening.  So she launched into Phase One of her professional routine... \n\nShe smiled at me.\n\nOk, wait, that previous sentence didn't do the trick.  I wrote it wrong.  What I'm trying to say is that she SMILED at me.  High wattage.  Mega dosage.  Not too much, but also not nearly too little.  Splendid.  Brightness.  Warmth.  Like a force of nature.  But a force of nature that cared for you (like a breeze in the tropics), not a tsunami.\n\nMan, it was one helluva smile.  You want to talk about feeling welcome someplace?  I didn't just feel welcome in Charlotte.  I felt welcome on Planet Earth.  \n\nPeople talk about aptitude for certain kinds of work.  Whoever thought up the idea (perhaps it was her) to have Dottie deploy her radiant smile as a greeter or goodwill ambassador was just simply very skilled at career suitability identification.\n\nHaving encountered something so special, I felt funny asking something so mundane: where to get a cuppa joe.  But she rocked it.  And I walked away.\n\nAnd I thought... Christian, you can't just walk away from a gift like that.  You gotta acknowledge it.  So I went back and I did.  And I learned something interesting...\n\n\"Dottie, I'm Christian.\"\n\"Nice to meet you.\"\n\"I just want to tell you that your smile is really something wonderful and I'm glad I encountered it and its owner.\"\nIf you can believe it, the smile intensified.  \n\"You have no idea how much I needed to hear that today.  Thank you.\"\n\nAnd as I walked away, I marveled at what she'd just said.  Here she was, a professional and sincere dispenser of human warmth, who needed some herself.  I guess guardian angels sometimes need guarding, too.
