Geiger's is such a lovely store. I'm a fan of all locations of this family owned business, and each one feels different.\n\nLike the other locations, this Geiger's has a great selection of upscale women's clothing, including a huge Vera Bradley selection (if you're into that). But where this location stands out is the selection of sports equipment. If you're a sports enthusiast, nearly half of the store is dedicated to equipment and probably anything you could ever need for most sports.\n\nMy idea of camping is literally Phyllis Neffler in Troop Beverly Hills, but if I ever decide to pitch a tent in the wilderness, I imagine I'll find everything I need here to live off the land. Otherwise, I'll stick to their glorious selection of ski wear and equipment, as well as the beautiful selection of Patagonia and other jackets. Oh, and i'll stick to purchasing their beautiful women's wear and killer cashmere scarves.
