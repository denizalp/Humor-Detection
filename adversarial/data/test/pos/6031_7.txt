A classic example of 'Bait and Switch!!'\n\nThis SUCKed!!! For a variety of reasons. \n\n1- Would have turned around to leave once we realized everyone had VIP wristbands. Why pay for express line if it doesn't exist. PLUS all vendors must follow what has been advertised. \n2 - most vendors didn't have samples. Only items at full price. Hello, my prepaid tickets were for SAMPLES!!\n3 - drink coupons not honored by vendors except Affogato, which charged us 5 tickets for ice tea. (That's $2\/ticket). So $10 for the tea!!!!!\n4 - no way near the advertised food selections. \nFrom the website:\n\"We have Street Food from all over the world, including London, Africa, Thailand, China, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Mexico, Italy, Greece and many more. From the United States, we have Southern Cooking, Southwest Flavors, East Coast Bites, and Hawaiian awesomeness.\"\n\nWhere are the listed vendors? We didn't see Badass cupcakes, brittle, hush puppies, chimichachacha, Grilled Cheese Nation, London street eats, Gourmet meatballs, Onion Ringmaster!! No pies, no steakhouse, no Quesodelicious!!!!!\nWant more examples, noTornado Potato!, no Tator Tot truck, no Thai fusion or Lobster Dude!!!!!\nSorry but filling the food spaces with funnel cakes and kettle corn just sucks. \n\n5 - Everything about the event sucked!! The organizers should be ashamed. In this day and age of food festivals, there is no excuse. \n\nWe want our money back!!!!!
