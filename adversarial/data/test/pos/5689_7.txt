Pros:\n+ Design inside the restaurant\n+ Patio: fire pit, water wall, umbrellas, heaters\n+ Brunch served 'til 4pm on weekends\n\nCons\n- Coffee is badbadbad\n- Inconsistent food quality\n- Super pulpy mimosas (maybe a 'pro' for pulp lovers? Their opinions don't count though; who likes pulp?)\n\nGetting out of bed after most places had stopped serving brunch two days in a row led to two consecutive brunches at Province last weekend. Which was good because now I know that it wasn't just one off day they had on Saturday, but that it's a genuinely mediocre brunch option.\n\nCoffee that was served was cold the first visit, burnt and bitter the second. Being poured the bottom of the pitcher led to grounds floating in my mug. Whatev, it happens. But the server not saying anything--or fixing it--was disappointing.\n\nMushroom\/goat cheese omelet was fine. Actually, pretty good. Dressing on the side salad was great & the tomatoes were super fresh (salad was better than the omelet). Benedict on visit 2 was really, really disappointing. English Muffins used as the base were great but that's where the positives end. The sauce was too thick, had very little flavor and there was way too much of it. \n\nOver-cooked poached eggs really piss me off. As a cook or a server it's painfully obvious when eggs are overdone. No jiggle? Don't serve them. Sadly, two completely solid eggs were put on my plate. Cut into them, took the solid top off like a lid to show the completely solid center and pushed them aside on the plate. Again, server said nothing.\n\nHe got the pancakes on visit #1 and chorizo tacos on #2. Plate was cleaned both times, so they couldn't have been that bad. It's possible I'd go back, but only on a beautiful day to enjoy the patio and possibly try the mini churros.
