This place makes me laugh.\n\nThey have some very cheap clothes and you definitely get what you pay for. They have two locations now in Chandler mall. One location is in place of Love Culture and the other took the location where Wet Seal was. \n\nBeing that they are the same store, in the same mall, they are pretty different. The clothes seem the same however the customer service is different. Both stores lack in customer service but the downstairs location is horrible. Everything is up high and if you need to get something down good luck finding someone to help you besides whoever is behind the counter tagging merchandise.  \n\nWhat is funny to me is the downstairs locations music. It is music singing about Jesus on repeat. Talking about \"Callllll outttt to Jesus!!! If you need to know Jessssussss is the answer because he is Jeeeesusssss\". Literally, I had fun coming up with lyrics to the songs as the continued and honestly, I was pretty accurate with which lyrics would follow next. This seems a little odd, and it's definitely annoying to shop to. They are selling trendy clothes, put on the radio I can guarantee you would get customer to shop for a few more minutes. The music drives me insane. \n\nEven funnier is going from the downstairs location to the upstairs the music goes from only talking about Jesus, to talking about bump and grind, and ass and titties. Probably should find a happy medium between the two, just sayin.
