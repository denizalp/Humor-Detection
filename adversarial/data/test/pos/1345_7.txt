Man, it's hot in this place. I walked in on a cold winter's afternoon and my glasses fogged up faster that Reagan's memory. As waited for the lenses to clear, I took in my surroundings. Ackee Tree is a pretty spacious restaurant with lots of seating in the back. It has peach-coloured walls adorned with large canvasses, and is somewhat blurry. I put my glasses back on and placed an order.\n\nI was in the mood for a light snack so I ordered up a spicy beef patty on a cocobun. The girl behind the counter seemed visibly disappointed by this, and vanished into the back -- presumably to wear they keep the beef patties and cocobuns. In the meantime, I scanned their selection of drinks Carribean and otherwise: Ting, Ginger beer, Kola Champagne, and something called Tropical Rhythms which looked like it might be a fruit nectar but wasn't. Except for water and diet coke, everything seemed to contain sugar.\n\nPaying was the most controversial part of this experience. I used debit and not only is there a $0.50 there is also an option to leave either a 15% or 20% tip. Do you remember that part in SpaceQuest III when Roger Wilco is at the space restaurant and the alien asks if you want space fries with that, and your options are \"yes\" and \"yes\"? It was like that. Pressing \"other\" does nothing. Refusing to pay an additional 15 (or 20 ha!) percent on my now $3.65 beef patty (which would bring the price to $4.20, hmmm), I asked her straight up: \"how do I not leave a tip\"? The answer: press 'report'.  Now you know!  Emm, ee, aitch.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Kathy said it best: ACK!\n\nMenu Readability: Printed very beautifully on a large chalkboard behind the counter.\n\nNeed to mention: The food was OK. I've had better beef patties and it wasn't really spicy at all.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I played way too much SpaceQuest.
