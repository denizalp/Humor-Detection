Decor and ambiance 5\/5 food 2\/5 service 5\/5\nThe muhammara lacked spice, was too oily, too runny, lacked consistency. The mint cucumber salad, was also oily and the red pickled onions clashed with the strong mint leaves...quoting my boyfriend \"I feel like I'm eating a mojito \". Also had the argentinian sausage, I don't think they did very much other then just cut it up and put in a bowl... \nI also have to mention this was a Friday night around 8pm... I got in the restaurant expecting a busy evening...there was one other couple and a group of four people in the back. Perhaps this is because of the food? Probably has to do with grinder next door stealing their customers as well. Food was disappointing...would not recommend.
