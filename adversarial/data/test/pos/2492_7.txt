Review is for lunch. Mediocre at best. Food was bland, and anything but memorable. Ambiance non-existent (dated decor, bare walls, quite unappealing). The only value was good service, but that's far from sufficient to recommend this place. With so many choices on the Strip, this would be at the very bottom of my list.
