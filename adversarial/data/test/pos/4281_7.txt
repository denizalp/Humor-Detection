On my way to Vegas from Orange County, my back rear tire had decided to shred itself into pieces. Being stuck in the middle of the desert, with humid heat, by myself was not a great start of the trip already. After calling a tow truck service to replace the tire with the spare, the tow truck  had recommended Ted Wiens Tires for cheap tires. \n\nI was pretty exhausted and looked up Ted Wien - I wasn't impressed. So my boyfriend decided to look up other tire stores and found Superior Tire about 5 miles away from the strip. We called the store and the sales associate named Matt was extremely helpful over the phone. \n\nWhen we met up with Matt, he carefully inspect the rest of my tires. He was pretty honest on which ones needed replacing and which ones didn't. He was very reasonable, friendly, and approachable. This definitely turned my Vegas trip around. Now, I can feel safe about driving back to California and know that there's a nationwide warranty in case anything happens to my new tires. I would recommend people that ever needs tires replacing to come to this store. And ask for Matt! He will be able to take care of ya (:
