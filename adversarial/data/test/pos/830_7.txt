Miku? More like LITku. It's now one of my most fav. restaurants.\n\nI booked a table via OpenTable a week prior. It gets booked up quick, so make a reservation.\n\nWe arrived and they took us to our table. We browsed the menu for a while and decided to order 4 things: Aburi Oshi Plate, Miku Roll, Aburi Prime, Green Tea Opera Cake.\n\nHoly smokes. Everything was impeccable. You really have to consciously slow down your mouth, so that you can appreciate all the flavours.  Everything was fresh and lit af.  A few notes:\n\nAburi Oshi Plate - The salmon was the undisputed champ here. The saba was nice as well if you like makarel. The ebi was the least preferable \/ tbh, kinda tasted like a yellow starburst.\n\nMiku Roll - it was lit. There's a reason it's named after the restaurant.\n\nAburi Prime - this was the grand masterpiece. I've never had such high quality, decorative sushi before. Everything from the various tunas to uni was presented. I highly recommend this one. Though it's pricey, I justified it by treating it as an experience, not just food.\n\nGreen Tea Opera Cake - this cake was amazing. You must order it if you come to Miku. I have dreams about the dark chocolate with the green tea and raspberry, etc all melding tgh in my mouth.\n\nService was great. I made a note in the OpenTable reso, saying that it was my companion's bday. I didn't even have to mention it in person and they still remembered to write \"Happy B Day\" on the dessert plate. My companion was both impressed and confused as to how they knew.\n\nSave Miku for a special occasion, it will change your life for the better.
