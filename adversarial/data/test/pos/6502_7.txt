10\/24\n\nCouldn't wait till a Friday UYE at DD, so I opted to go on my own and try the Daily Dose Kobe burger and sweet potato fries at happy hour prices ($5, plus a $1.50 upcharge for any side dish substitution other than their hand-cut fries or regular fries).  It's not 100% Kobe, but Daily Dose's \"own house blend of Kobe and beef burger patty.\"  I asked my server to have the sweet potato fries cooked extra-crispy, and she assured me that their way of preparing them made them very crispy.  I also ordered a glass of Cab ($5).\n\nLoved the two pieces of thick-cut pepper-smoked bacon!  Their crispiness lent the Kobe-beef burger a much-needed textural component it greatly lacked, or so I thought.  (I'm a huge fan of the \"crust\" that cooking on flat-tops and grills impart on food, be they cuts of meat, stone fruits, bread, or veggies!)  I enjoyed the harissa aioli on top of the aged cheddar, but I wished that the pretzel bun spent more time in the oven\/grill.  The sweet potato fries were very unsatisfactory.  I would definitely order it extra-extra crispy, or I may just try the chorizo mac 'n cheese next time I go.  The Gladiator burger ($5.50, plus fries) is calling my name...
