Mrs Cruz.\nI love this place! I live in this apartments for a year and I never had a problem. The ladys at the office are very professional and very nice and maintenance is fast and very respectful. I only moved out cause I need it a bigger place due to the growth of my family. The manager she is awesome. Overall I think this is the place to be.
