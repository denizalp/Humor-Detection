We were in search of an authentic sushi bar where they serve high  quality fresh omasake menu owned by a Japanese sushi chef but knew that none would exist on the vegas strip.  After all, Vegas isn't exactly known for sushi.  I found Sen of Japan on Yelp and noticed their high rating from 60 reviewers and voted as the best sushi restaurant in Vegas by Zagat.   Well, worth the try!!  \n\nThis place is around 10 minutes away from the Vegas strip.  We sat on the sushi bar and ordered the Omakase.  Our sushi chef's name was Sunny.  I would have to give him 5 stars for excellent service.  He was very attentive and worked quickly to serve not just our dinner but also the orders he had to full fill from other customers.   \n\nThe sashimi were all nicely plated and were topped with different garish on each fish.  The layout of every dish was so pretty but the taste was even better.  I loved the way they prepared the rice where it was perfectly moist and wet.  Some places gives you a glob of dry rice that ruins the whole experience.  \n\nOmasake was $55-$85 per person depending on how much you wanted to eat.  I was full when I reached the $55 mark.  After the last toro fish, I felt content.  \n\nLA offers higher quality sushi places but for being Vegas, it was good enough for me to rate them at least 4 stars.  \n\nIf I were in Vegas again, I'd come back here. If you're sick of all those typical hotel buffets, go try Sen of Japan.  I don't recommend ANY sushi restaurant on the strip.  Those are catered to non asian customers who don't know the difference between sushi or sashimi and are content with previously  frozen fish.
