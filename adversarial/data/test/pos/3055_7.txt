Excellent food, very good service.  The Vogue Burger was juicy and flavorful and loaded with toppings... but it was a bit messy.  Or maybe that was just me... but I digress.  My dinner companion had the Onion Soup and seemed very pleased with it; however she may have just been happy because I was there.  \n\nThe drinks did take a little while to arrive, but it was a Friday night and it was busy, so it's understandable.  The server was pretty attentive and knowledgeable, so no complaints there.\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience - I'd definitely go back!
