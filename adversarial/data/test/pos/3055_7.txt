THIS REVIEW IS RATED PG13 FOR ADULT LANGUAGE \n\nFUCK THIS PIECE OF SHIT COMPANY!  I hate that I had to give them one star.  So on a Sunday we turned off the water valve in the garage because we were working on the kitchen sink.  Something snapped when it was being shut off and the water supply in our home stopped working.  We called our warranty and they told us this company would call us to schedule an appointment within 24 hours (I guess running water isn't an emergency). \n\nSo today Javier from Air Pro shows up 15 minutes before our scheduled time (thankfully I had just got home) and had attitude before he even stepped into the garage.  I can say with 100% certainty this asshole had his mind made up before he arrived that he wasn't doing the repair.  I offered him water and started to explain the problem when he very shortly and rudely said he would put in the report to the warranty that he didn't see how the valve broke and didn't have the parts to do the repair on him. What?!?  You're a FN PLUMBER! Isn't that what you do daily?!  Plus, when we put in the claim we explained EXACTLY what happened - wouldn't you want to come prepared?! And also, asshole, you don't know how it broke?!?! How about that valve is probably turned once every 4 years and maybe, juuuussst maybe, it is corroded and rusted, causing it to break??? I'll just leave that suggestion right there for you to play with next time you encounter this problem, you plumbing genius. \n\nNow to the best part - this unprofessional, unbelievably rude, lazy employee writes in his report to our home warranty that the valve was broke because of excessive force causing them to deny the claim.  REALLY?!?!  It was simply turned off!!  Then they had the balls to call us and say they will fix it for $900 (another company quoted $320).  \n\nThankfully our warranty agreed that his report sounded inaccurate and they're sending another company to look at it. \n\nDO NOT USE THIS SHIT EXCUSE OF A COMPANY!!!! Javier is the worst excuse of a lazy incompetent \"professional\" I've ever dealt with. \n\nThat being said I shall now go wash my fingers in bleach.
