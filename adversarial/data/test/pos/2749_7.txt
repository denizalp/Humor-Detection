This is by far the worst place I have ever lived in my adult life. There is absolutely no communication here what so ever!!!  The water has been turned off twice this month with no advanced warning so far. And when I've called the office they are either clueless or they don't answer the phone at all.  \n\nThe on site management is a very bad joke. He doesn't answer his door or texts when there's an issue. \n\nIf you want any peace of mind at all in a place you call home I strongly, strongly suggest you go elsewhere.
