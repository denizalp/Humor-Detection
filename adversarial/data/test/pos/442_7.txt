--Not a fan of how the show promoted nationalism--you were seated in different sections, each section assigned to a different \"country\" (e.g. Ireland, France, Austria, Hungary, Spain, Norway, Russia, and Dragon!).  They could have easily just assigned colors to sections instead.\n--It also had no female speaking roles (where's Guinevere?) which *might* have been forgivable had they not taken liberties with the story.  Arthur did not have a son named Chris.  If they were going to make stuff up, why didn't Arthur have a made-up daughter instead?
