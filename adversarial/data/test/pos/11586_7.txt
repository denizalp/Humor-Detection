This is a great place to kick back and chill with buddies. They have a great selection of beer, their food is pretty good at decent prices and they have huge TV's to watch sports on. No complaints there. However, my last two times visiting Real Sports, the service has been quite underwhelming. \n\nThe second last time I visited, the waitress obviously hated her job. Place wasn't packed but she gave us attitude when we asked to move to a table with a better view of the big screen TV. When asked for whether she thought one dish was better than the other, she told us, in a rude tone, that she didn't like either (which wasn't expected). And not once did she come to check up on us and whether we wanted more drinks. \n\nThis time around, my buddies and I met up after a long day of work around 8pm. We had a great waitress who was very friendly and struck up conversation naturally. We got our food and our drinks in a timely manner and the service was great. We also got one bill but paid evenly with three credit cards. \n\nAfter we had settled up, we stayed at the table for another 45 minutes or so, catching up, before we had to leave - each of us had to go finish up work for the night and one of us had a train to catch. Just before we're about to get up, the manager (name was Lornie or something) comes to our table and tells us our waitress had screwed up the payment and that he had to refund two of the credit cards before charging us again. \n\nFirst off, he really didn't explain the situation well as all three of us were pretty confused. Secondly, he then disappeared for a good 10-15 minutes while we were stranded to just wait for him to come back as he had taken one of our cards (no idea why he had to take just one of our cards). \n\nWhen he finally came back with our waitress, we told him we were in a rush and that we didn't appreciate the time he was spending on this when we had already settled up what we owed. He still couldn't explain the situation but he began raising his voice at us for \"giving him a hard time about this when it was his first time\" or something. After his long spiel, he went on to tell us that he had come back to apologize for the situation but it was not his problem (!??!) and that he would make sure we were \"taken care of\" the next time we come in if we shoot him an email. \n\nNot his problem? Shoot him an email? The way I see it, we're patrons of the restaurant and if something goes wrong, you acknowledge it, apologize straight up and make up for it. Probably the first time I've seen a manager cause frustration and not offer a discount of some sort.
