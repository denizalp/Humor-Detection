Fortunately, Mrs. K. has yet to discover that there is a Coach shop in the Southpark Mall. I have, but only because I need to know where it is so that I can subtly distract her when she heads down this particular wing of the mall. Because Coach is the top-of-the-line, numbero-uno brand of handbags and accessories. \n\nTherefore, it's expensive. And add to that the \"exclusivity\" of the Southpark mall and you end up with a very dear piece of arm candy.\n\nTip: There is a Coach outlet at the Gaffney Mall. It is well worth your time and money to head there first for the same great quality if perhaps not the current season's offerings in handbags and purses from Coach.
