I ordered our breast pump through our insurance via Edgepark. Initially, I was given 3 choices of where to order from, including Edgepark, not a single one had reviews above 2.5 stars on yelp, causing great anxiety.  After carefully reviewing and researching each one, I settled on Edgepark, based on the reviews from others who've ordered breast pumps through them. \n\nI called to inquire on a Tuesday, my customer rep was Angela. She was pretty helpful, but I wasn't holding my breath that things would go smoothly. She gave me my information to log in online and review the pumps that were available to me based on my insurance carrier. The following day, I placed my order online (use amazon for best reviews on pumps and ensure you check the bottle compatibility chart).  I got an Email the same Friday stating it had shipped and by the time I got home Monday, it was sitting on my front porch. It was a lot less painful of an experience than I had been expecting. The only thing I noticed is that they seem to price gouge the insurance companies. The same pump that was sent to me was charged ~$370 to my insurance, based on the bill included in the box. amazon sells the exact same one with prime shipping for ~$170. \n\nGranted I've not used it just yet, baby still has some in utero time left, but I'm holding out hope it works.
