In the Japanese-food wasteland of Chinese-run Monster Truck McSushi Rolls from Hell (tm) AYCE emporia (with those stupid iPads, God I hate them), is this light at the end of the tunnel.   Kobo Gourmet is Japanese owned and operated!  If you've heard about Zen (formerly in Scarborough, but moved to Markham), Kobo is Zen's cheaper kid brother in Pickering who is (almost) as authentic.  No iPads, no language barriers, no missed orders here.  Just authentic Japanese food (sadly, with some McRolls for the gaijin... if you want those, go over to Dragon Rolls, why are you here wasting Chef Nobu's talent?)\n\nWhen ordering sushi, to me you either get the Omakase Sushi (meaning a plate of Nigiri, $22) or the Omakase Sashimi (no rice, just fish, $24).  At Zen you'll pay $80 or $90 respectively for these.  So if you're new to REAL sushi but don't want the sticker shock and the drive to Markham, this is the way to go.   And don't go making that Yoda sauce either... you're a grown-up now. Leave Yoda sauce (and the stupid rolls) to the high school kids over at Dragon Rolls.\n\nFor appetizers, you can't go wrong with any of it, but i feel Miso soup is a tired old cliche and you see it everywhere.  Change things up and get the Ushio Soup instead, which is a nice large bowl of clear bonito dashi soup stock with shrimps and scallops in it.  Delicious.  If you've had Beef Tataki at any of the AYCE iPad places, get it here and you'll be stunned at the difference in taste, it's like night and day.  The beef is lean, not gristly, and the ginger sauce is perfectly prepared.  The green tea is one of the best I've had in recent memory; only the kind served by Sushi Kaji in Etobicoke was similar.  (and you'll spend $120+ per person to dine there!). For under $3, it's a treat!\n\nBottom line, Chinese-run \"Japanese\" places (whether AYCE or not) are all crap.  Just the same dozen or so stupid rolls that all taste the same and are not authentic at all (you won't find them at any respectible sushi place in Tokyo).   If you want authentic Japanese food, make sure the place is run by Japanese, and this place is the real deal.    Come here and you'll never want McSushi again, in fact you'll probably be calling Zen to reserve your next food experience!   Welcome to the big leagues!
