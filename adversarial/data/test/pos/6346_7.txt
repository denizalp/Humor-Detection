We dined at the golden steer last night, as soon as we finished eating the hostess came by and said she need the table and if we could leave, I replied we will soon.\nShe returned a few minutes later and keep asking us to leave and kept standing at out table. We found it extremely rood. I will NEVER go back.\nI dined there many times in the last 20 + years, no more.\n5 of us dined, I left my regular 20% tip and to be treated like this is beyond absurd.
