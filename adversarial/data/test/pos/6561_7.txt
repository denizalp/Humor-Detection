I'll start by noting that a big part of this relatively positive review is because of the excellent service by our waiter. Aside from that the food was nothing to write home about.\n\nMy friend and I came in around 7 craving burgers. We decided to split a pastrami patty melt and a BBQ bacon burger, one with fries and the other with onion rings for good measure. \n\nI sampled the BBQ bacon burger first and was not excited in the least. I commented to my friend that it tasted just like a bacon western burger only four times the price. A few seconds later our server came by to check on us and commented about how much she likes the BBQ bacon burger because it tastes like a western bacon cheeseburger. Guess I was right! I didn't care for the BBQ said very much so I stuck with the pastrami patty melt, which was decent. The fries and onion rings were a lackluster way to round out our meal.\n\nService was excellent and friendly, but there wasn't much else to make me want to return.
