The summit trail has to be the most deceiving trail ever. The peak is not visible until you get about 10 minute hiking distance so even if you think you're there...you most likely are not. BUT the view is amazing and you literally feel like you're on top of the world. \n\nParking at the bottom of the trail, no restroom (at least near this trail), no dogs\/horses, and the only downfall-- way too popular. We went earlier in the day and were very glad...there were way too many people hiking up on our way down. \n\nWill come back!
