For a soup, salad and delicious tea lunch, Paymon's gets the job done. The small Greek salad is plenty big, and cheeseheads take note: they definitely do not skimp on the feta. When I couple that with a bowl of their lentil soup and passion fruit iced tea, I am super content. It isn't particularly fancy, but their lentil soup is nicely seasoned and has some hearty vegetables floating about. In addition to the great brewed iced tea, they also offer a selection of loose leaf teas in pots. I appreciate that. \n\nMore than likely you can expect a wait around lunchtime, and on my last visit, the host seemed a bit overwhelmed. We weren't greeted, and the seating process was a little confusing. However, once we were seated Anthony, our server, was terrific. \n\nThey do have a hookah lounge. They are open pretty late seven days a week, and on this visit, I noticed they have Customer Appreciation night on Wednesday - 25% between 5-7pm. (I think those are the right times. Double check my quick tip!)\n\nI guess Paymon's is a Vegas institution for a reason! (Even if I get my falafel elsewhere...)
