Today was a gelato day. I had three servings today at three places and I must say it is so great to be back at a place by Desyree!\n\nI even mistakenly went to the Art of Flavors today thinking she reopened the place as I heard she was opening up but I didn't pay attention. \n\nSo back at her new place I am absolutely happy to be here. \n\nI will not describe at all the type of Flavors but the experience. \n\n1.  Greeting- you automatically feel at home with warm welcomes from the entire team. It is both inviting and heartfelt. \n\n2.  The tryout- all the Flavors are created and you will be invited to try many and to experience Flavors and mixtures only the most creative chef can imagine. It is so fun to experience this explosion of daring creativity. \n\n3.  The taste- the only way to describe this is   Comfort food at its best. Not saying that gelato is comfort food but if you ever just felt so good having spaghetti, or that feeling of having fried chicken or mom's apple pie, that same feeling is what you will get here at Gelatology!  You feel at home here and the taste is n√∫mero uno. \n\nGK says come on back and enjoy!
