Due to the high prices here, I probably would actually rate this a 3.5 stars. Bumping it up to 4 because there was nothing really wrong with the food or experience-- just pricey. \n\nIt really was a great meal-- but honestly, I find it hard to shell out $100\/meal in general unless it's something really extraordinary. \n\nA group of us ordered some raw oysters-- $3-4\/piece. Great & plenty of condiments to make it just how I like it. Fresh.\n\nShared the tuna tower appetizer-- which was just ok. I was not impressed because the majority of this dish was a cracker crumb bottom. Very little actual tuna proportion wise. \n\nBone-in filet cooked medium rare. They got this right on! Delicious. Added a tiny bit of salt to some pieces but otherwise perfect! \n\nCreamed spinach & snap peas were awesome! Big enough portions for 5-6 people. Snap peas were cooked ever so slightly so that they still had a bit of the raw crunch to them. I liked that, but some people might not prefer it that way. Creamed spinach was what we called \"spinach dip\" because it was so fatty and delicious. \n\nThe part that disappointed me the most was the dessert. Carrot cake was good but I wished they put more cream cheese in the icing. The icing was too sugary. Chocolate cake also lacked a rich chocolate flavor-- it was also a bit too sugary. Butter cake was delicious, but I've had better. \n\nService- excellent. No complaints. Very attentive\nAmbiance- very romantic. VERY dim lighting-- I personally prefer more light because I like to see my food to enjoy it even more, but this is great for a date.
