The pizza here is good. Thin or Sicilian it's good. Specials don't run from certain times during lunch it's actually all day which I like. Sicilian pizza is thick and the size of the slices are big enough to not leave you hungry at all. One thing I wasn't that crazy about it the garlic knots. The knots were kind of tough and appeared to have a lot of seasoning on them yet I really didn't taste any garlic at all. The meat sauce that came with the knots though tasted very good. I have stopped by on my lunch break and seen different types of pizza out so even though they have a daily special board it doesn't mean you can actually get any of that. If it's the younger guy he will only sell you what's out but if it's the older guy he will make any pizza or sandwich you want if you are willing to wait for it.
