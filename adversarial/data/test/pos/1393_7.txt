If you need a simple exhaust or muffler fix, they got it here for cheap. For the low so to speak. If you need a repair that requires extensive labor requiring the engine to be removed or if the exhaust leak is close to the manifold, they will not be able to do it. You cannot make an appointment and need to wait in the waiting room. It reminds me of The Walking Dead. Pretty weird but life is weird.
