We came here since we were in the area and craving fish and chips. We ordered the halibut and chips. The fish was really greasy that you can see the oil in a pool on the plate. The fries were crispy but nothing special.. Just your normal frozen fries. The tartar sauce comes in packages and you have to request lemon slices from them, it doesn't come already on the plate. For the price ($11.75 for the fish and chips and $14.75 for the fish and chips plus drink and coleslaw) I wouldn't come back here. You can better for cheaper elsewhere.
