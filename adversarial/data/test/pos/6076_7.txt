The 50s old man (probably the owner) is very very rude! I went there purchasing some foods for a friends' gathering as well as my own stuffs. It is fairly reasonable for me to pay respectively right? But this old man kept complaining that I shouldnt do that becauae he would have to swipe my card twice and cost him extra transction fees. How ridiculous it was! I could let one of my friends to check and the second-swipe of the credit card is inevitable! Even worse, there will make some expired food on discount. Luckily we found these awful expired foods twice, and they were reluctant to make exchange with NO apologies!!!\n\nI have to say it is definitely not a good place for Chinese, Asians, or ANYBODY! If you wanna get some HEALTHY Asian foods, please go to somewhere else!
