Did you know if you tell them you are celebrating a birthday, they'll bring a complimentary plate of truffles? Well.. Don't worry. They will tell you when you book the reservation, when they confirm the reservation, and then finally when they remind of you of their reservation that they bring you these amazing truffles...\n\nOddly though.. we were celebrating a birthday with that same reservation, and no truffles for us.\n\nHowever, this place is gorgeous as Eva Longoria.  Me and my ladies came here and we all ordered the halibut. Yep, we were lame that way.  t actually was delish, and that potato thing was carb yummyness! The lobster mac and cheese a la carte was nothing super spectacular as the cheese seemed old and it was lacking salt.  The carrots were pretty good.\n\nService was decent and attentative.  Crowd is quite beautiful, and this seems like a nice place for a group, because there are many options on the menu.  However, that irritating reminder about the truffles and then the failure on the non-delivery drops this down a star, and the meh mac and cheese brings it down one more notch.
