If I could give  this review 10 I would! Both times I've eaten at the Bellagio Buffet have been for Brunch. The first time was amazing but the second blew my mind into a different galaxy. Let me tell you why!\n\nFor five bucks extra you can indulge in the unlimited champagne during Brunch. Last memorial day me and about 30 of my old college friends decided to reserve three tables and let the champagne makes us even more ridiculous.\n\nChampagne aside they serve fillet Mignon for breakfast! I find it very difficult to find Eggs Benedict at a regular breakfast joint but the Bellagio Brunch will make you cry tears of joy. They have crab legs and buckets upon buckets of shrimp. The desserts are rich and plentiful as well as the exotic fruit .The service was great and we stayed until they served sushi for Lunch. \n\nThe only downpart was when the manager cut me and the remaining 6 friends off and would not allow us to drink any more.\n\nI've made plans to go again and will be ready to feast away!
