I FINALLY made it out to Singh Meadows this past weekend and came home will all kinds of goodies!! I totally miss the cozy farm but I know this move was out of their control so i'm embracing change! The best part, dogs are allowed at this location as long as you go around back and sit on their patio! YEEE! Harvey is going to be the happiest camper. They're open Saturdays and Sundays only from 8 AM - 2 PM. \n\nWhen you arrive, you walk up to their market of sorts that is rather small but packed full of local goodies like in-season produce, honey, dips, breads, baked goods, sauces, jams, cheese, spring rolls, etc. Once you purchase your food for the week, head out back where you can order from their quaint little cafe and snag a fresh juice! They also had baby goats in a little corral and they were SO cute! This is a great place to let the kiddos run around - it is like a wide open pasture. The fact that the market is indoors, makes it bearable in the summer! I will definitely be making a regular stop here to get fresh, local produce because it really doesn't get better than that!\n\nThis trip, we left with corn, tomatoes, peppers, Baba Ganoush, chive pretzels, spring rolls, a delicious watermelon juice, and a granola bar. I'm heading out of town this week so next time I will absolutely be snagging more produce! Thanks for being so awesome as always, Singh Meadows!!
