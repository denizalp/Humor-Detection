In the mood for some chili and parked in front of, guess what?, Chili's.  Been feeling under the weather lately and a good cup of chili should do.  Might as well get chili at a place named Chili's.\n\nI wanted to minimize how many people I got sick, so I opted to enter through their To-Go entrance. Plus, I'm getting my food to go. Makes perfect sense.  The problem with their To-Go area is that no one was there to take my order.  So, I sat and sat and sat.  While I waited, I could hear a bunch of their servers giggling from the kitchen.  I must have had my invisible cloak on today.  After about 5 minutes of zero service, which felt like an hour, I decided to make my presences known.  The best way to do this is enter their kitchen.  So, I did.  That immediately got the chatter to stop and my order taken.  Finally!!! \n\nPretty sure they can tell I was irritated because the guy taking my order seemed to go above and beyond with great customer service. Good save Chili's  \n\nI ended up getting the Enchilada Chicken Tortilla Soup and Sliders w\/extra Onion Strings.  I know I originally came in for their chili, but remembered how good their Enchilada Tortilla Soup was. I only ordered the sliders because I haven't got any protein since the day prior.  Got my order in less than 15 minutes, took it home, and within 30 minutes was a happy man.  Love their Tortilla Soup!!!\n\nBeen to this Chili's 2 other times, but just for appetizers and drinks.  Service didn't start out good today, but ended great.  Again, good save and I plan on coming back. \n\nNOTE:  Food to go always seems smaller than when you eat it there.  Just a thought for the next time I order To-Go.  Just means I need to order more.
