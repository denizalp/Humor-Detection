I marched in here prepared for battle royale the day I decided to get a gym membership. Gym sales staff are notorious for being slightly less aggressive than orcas, and I didn't want to get taken for a ride. On the contrary, Erick was very friendly in setting up my membership. Not pushy and extremely helpful. (Like a dolphin, perhaps?) He showed me around the facility, explained that I could upgrade or downgrade my plan at any time, and hooked me up with a great deal.\n\nAs for the gym itself, it has everything a humble weakling like me could possibly want. There are tonnes (literally!) of freeweights and cardio machines, and some resistance machines based on air pressure that I barely understand how to use. There are squash courts on the top most floor, which are almost always booked.\n\nThe changerooms are pretty swell, but I wouldn't move in. And their sauna is one of the hottest I have ever experienced. Now if only I could motivate myself to visit once in a while.\n\nObligatory French Pun: Will turn you into a BON VIVANT!\n\nMenu Readability: Dude, can I get a spot?\n\nNeed to mention: The squash courts can be booked online and fill up faster than a Stones concert.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: That my pecs need some serious blastin'.
