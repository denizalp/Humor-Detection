a fine tuned machine\nbest seafood in cleveland\nkeeps humming along\n\nI keep waiting for the mediocrity I would expect from a big restaurant\/local chain, but...  I have to say, Blue Point Grille delivers.  Consistently good food, very solid service and the place has a very well maintained appearance.  Once again, I went there last night and was beyond pleasantly surprised.  Honestly, I was wowed.  So many places you go to with expectations, and they just fall a bit short.  Not here.\n\nAppetizers of house smoked mussels were outstanding.  The shrimp cocktail could have used a 5th shrimp on it, but they were fresh, large and firm. Fresh horseradish in the cocktail sauce was a nice touch too.\n\nEntrees for us included one more appetizer of the ubiquitous tuna tartare. Fresh, not neon in color, and served with guacamole-like topping, it was flawless.  The salmon entree was off the charts great, and the special sea bass was also excellent. \n\nSpecial props to the hosts\/hostesses for taking such fine care of a 3 top walk-in during primetime on a busy Friday night.\n\nAnd let's not forget that they have one of the finest happy hours in the warehouse district.  On Sundays as well.\n\nBravo Blue Point!\n\nCarry on...
