A small little park right off of Spadina. It's also called poop park. Clarence Square is one of the oldest remaining park spaces in the downtown core. The place is very neglected since all the dogs that come here have a poop party and the owners don't bother picking it up. It's got roughly 5 large cedar trees with patches of medium sized grassy terrains. It is a relatively quiet, and shady park. There is 4 benches and few picnic tables. There is a drinking fountain in the centre of the park. \n\nIf you want some entertainment come have a seat. But even the benches are questionable. Lots of crazies, crack heads, dog walkers, kids, young couples and tons of students walk through here. There's a guy that resembles Jesus, comes here with a book and pretends to talk to \"his friends\" telling them to be quiet. \n\nRight now... as in July 9th 3:19pm.. there is a gay couple making out hardcore on the park. I took picture... NOT because I want to exploit them... I'm shocked. HOW CAN THEY ROLL ALL OVER THE GRASS WITH ALL THE POOP???? \n\nIt's been 20minutes and they are still dry humping the lunar eclipse outta each other. Am I a pervert for staring? I'm worried ... about myself. \n\nI have a theory. They are def new lovers.. the way they are going at it. They met at pride last week and are on a tumultuous love affair rolling in dog poop parks and such. Anyhow,..... they are gone now. Hand in hand. Awww. \n\nI have never created a business and written a review so fast in my life. \nJust so I could share with my fellow partially perverted yelpers. \nThe fact that I'm not ashamed about my exploitation is a bit concerning. \n\nOH WELL. \n\nfun fact: In the northwest corner of the park is a historical plaque honouring Alexander Dunn, born near the park, who was the first Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross. In 1854, he was a participant in the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava, saving the lives of two fellow soldiers. \n\n\n\nenjoy the sunshine \n\nxoxo \nM.
