We were sucked in by the recent Hell's Kitchen competition and set a lunch date to experience Yardbird. I was double confident with my Yelp peeps nearly perfect stars, so confident I invited guests to join us and raved about how great this place is said to be. Ugh! Where\nDo I even begin! \n1) showed up and told we had no reservations and perhaps I made them for their MIA location? Party of 5 no reservation. Asked the hostess if I could put our name in and was told wait was over an hour but we could find a seat in the lounge. Let me say that again ASKED to put my name down and hostess said find a seat in the lounge. She did not take my name. \n2) We found an dirty table that still needed busing but it accommodated us awkwardly. Within 5minutes area was cleaned but it took longer to get menus or service. We weren't in a rush so that's okay but just not expected from such a place. \n3) food order taken we started with deviled eggs and Mac n cheese. Solid nothing above basic. Food comes out and our small table still has our dirty appetizer dishes and Un-filled water glasses on the table. Hubby is now peeved. \n4) food was not at all what the southern story of the owner describes. The chicken although was juicy and tender it was bland in flavor and my 3 squares of salted watermelon were really good but seriously, 1 inch 3 bites? That's it. THe brisket was over sauced, drenched in BBQ sauce and my husband only ate 1\/2. Mango salad on butter lettuce with grilled chicken was exactly that. The only dish that was worth an honorable mention was the slow roasted chicken salad that had this delicious sweet corn bread in it. \n5) I ordered a $5 sweet tea with my meal and it was really good! Served in a mason jar for that southern feel, I liked that. However, never asked if I needed a refill or wanted to order another. Out comes the check and I had to ask the server if the tea included a refill or could I order another? Her reply, \" oh, yeah...\" walks away. Ummmm, ok. I get the refill she takes the bill. We pay we leave. \nMoral of the review: \nA 2 stars \"I've had better, been treated better\" review. As Gordon Ramsey would say, \" Un ( insert F word) Believable! \nThere are wayyyyyy too many choices for chicken in Vegas than to ever put up with over pretentious, over-priced, underwhelming chicken. \nWon't be back, wouldn't recommend.
