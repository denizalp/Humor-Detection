Plenty of competition on this stretch of Montreal's Ste Catherine with a lot of emphasis on Asia. We stubbled on to this one since we wanted something light and ready to serve.\n\nThe decor was simple.it should actually think of doing a Reno given that there are a lot of competition which are more pleasing to the eye. Their menu featured over 30 dishes so they had a good selection. However, by quickly looking over the selection, it didn't seem to have a  lot of imagination and when we got  our meals, it was typical of what we usually get at Pho restaurants. The service was fast and our waitress was quite polite which was great since we wanted to go back to the downtown core right away. More like a 3,5 stars. A traditional Vietnamese resto $-$$
