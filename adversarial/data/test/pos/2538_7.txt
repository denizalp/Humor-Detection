Attended this church for almost 7years. Loved it at first,  It was  wonderful,  both my family and I had a great experience. Then as the years gone by,  I found myself lost and empty. I couldn't explain what's going on, I couldn't understand it but it seems like I am not satisfied with every service thereafter....\n\n         I felt the thirst, felt the hunger! I was not being fed by the word of God but rather a shallow shallow lack of Biblical theology. This church lacks wisdom. Lack of Biblical Truth. They don't teach about repentance. They don't teach the truth about sin and hell. They don't teach about being humble and self-denial but rather a lover of your own self. A lover of the world. They promote a false god and not the real Jesus of the Bible.\n\n         The pastor even loves to share Bible verse using  NIV.. which show his shallowness, lack of maturity, and lack of wisdom.  Most pastors especially real ones, uses ESV, KJV or NKJV.  Don't get me wrong, I am not saying he is evil but he lacks Biblical discernment.  He is a very very great motivational speaker but NOT a pastor.  This church is not a church for the sheeps but for the goats.. This church is oppressed. They certainly loves to promote a great show for the goats amusement.  \n\n        Most people who goes here are Bible illiterate. Non-believers that are blind, lost spiritually, shallow and conforming of this world. This church will do everything to make you feel welcomed and awesome and happy and cool and for you to have a great time but guess what?! -- they lack the real real purpose of what a church should be.. the purpose should be preaching the Bible, the True word of God, and making disciples for Our Lord Jesus Christ. \n\n      *****Open your Bibles, ladies and gentlemen, pray and seek for God's guidance while you read. Remember, Satan knows the Bible word for word  and he uses it to lead astray God's children and to deceive.\n\n        So if you are looking for a great worldly party experience go here. \n\n        This is the best LUKEWARM CHURCH here in Nevada. Wake up!!! Do not be deceived!!!
