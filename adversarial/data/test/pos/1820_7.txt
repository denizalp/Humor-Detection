Heather gets it done.  \n\nMy calluses can be a bear to work with, and I find that more times than not, the massages at other places can be half assed.   However, I was impressed with Heather's very thorough scrubbing of my calluses and firm foot and leg massage.  The decor is typical and clean.  The other staff seem pretty friendly, though I did feel 'barked' at upon arriving and had to wait about 35 minutes past my appointment time.\n\nConclusion:  If you're looking for someone to give you a good pedicure with a smile, Heather is your lady.
