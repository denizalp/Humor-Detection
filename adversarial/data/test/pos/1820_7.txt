This is Madison's place to watch soccer. They have a large screen that comes down to play those big games. Their drink prices and food prices are affordable. I've had the greek salad and the reuben before. The greek salad comes with a nice variety of crunchy veggies and dressing on the side (great for one person). My reuben was served with the seasoned curly fries. YUM! This is a big portion of food and can easily be shared between two people. I've had the cheese curds. You cannot go wrong with the cheese curds. The portion size is definitely large enough to share with a table of friends during a soccer\/football\/basketball game. They do have a smaller selection of beers on tap compared to other bars in the area. Do not let this get you down. They have a large list of beers in cans and bottles too. If you are looking for something in particular, just ask the bartender. They offer a full bar for those looking for something on the rocks.
