This place is a dump. I got hepc just waiting for my chicken kabob salad which took 20 minutes. Salad dressing I think was dirty dishwater, the lettuce was collected from the floor from under the prep area.  \nChicken was burned so the taste of burnt hair lasted in my mouth all day. \n\nEveryone who works there hate their lives from what I can gather very rude, and have the personality of a dishrag. \n\nIf you like 3rd world fast food this port-o-potty is the stop.
