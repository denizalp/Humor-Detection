At first we went, everything was perfect. The food was delicious, or so we thought, everything went well. The waitress messed up our orders but it was ok, not a big deal. We had to pay for bread which was kinda strange but again, not a big deal. Dinner went well and everything was alright. It's what's in the food that I question. My boyfriend and I and his parents we to eat there, we all ordered different things but idk something in the food have ALL FOUR of us diarrhea and tummy aches.  Boyfriend and I have been on the toilet for two days now along with his parents. This is really sketchy, I don't know how they did or what they did in the kitchen but I'm definitely never coming back. Awful explosive diarrhea and stomach aches. Spent $170 there just to get sick after. Very disappointed, I had really high expectations.
