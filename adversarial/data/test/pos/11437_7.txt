Omg where do I begin? Ok so first of all when I hear the word massage I think...relaxation, serenity, meditation, soothing and etc. I received none of that at this place. My husband and I booked a couples massage here as an anniversary gift to ourselves and it was the worst experience ever. They had us cover ourselves with a freakin bath towel, they had us laying on this raggedy massage table on top of the same paper you sit on at the Dr. The guy who massaged me would not stop coughing and sniffling and he reeked of cigarettes. The face mask he just threw on my face was soaking wet and cold, then when he got to my back he literally stood over my back and squirted out the lotion he was using on my back like he was busting a nut or something. He was horrible, he rushed thru my massage and was very rough with me. He and his partner talked the whole time, whispering and giggling with each other...I could not relax at all because of it. What really irritated me was the fact that they massaged us with some weak ass water based lotion instead of massage oil. Their product had no pleasant aroma to it, the Feng shui was all fucked up, 5star my ass! The worst part of this nightmare was the part where they had the audacity to stand there and ask for a freakin tip...here's a tip...stop talking stfu and do your job! I do not recommend this place, go there at your own risk. I've been to a ton of spas and this is by far the worst and I will never be back. These Masseuse are not trained or licensed I believe the owner found them on Craigslist smh! I think even 1star is too generous for this shit hole...
