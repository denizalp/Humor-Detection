This is long overdue, but Brew Tea is the best boba spot in Las Vegas.\n\nI'll be honest, I had my doubts because I thought the location was cursed with the constant business changes over the years, but it looks like Brew Tea is here to stay.\n\nIt seems to always be busy, but even when they're busy, they have fast service.\n\nI change up what I order all the time based on how I'm feeling, but it's a plus that I do have different drink options that I like vs. other boba spots where I only have one particular drink.\n\nThey're always consistent. I've never had an issue of my drink not tasting right or boba not being fresh enough. If there is an issue, it's nice that they give you an entire new drink fixing it.\n\nI get a large size with boba, no ice & if I get a milk tea, I add sea salt cream.\n\nThey have stamp cards, which you can easily have filled up because you're going to go so often.
