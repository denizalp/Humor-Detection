The reviews on Yelp are sordid.\n\nAnyone who thinks this place has \"Japanese\" crepes should just stop writing. Hey people, why don't you just keep a diary next to your beds instead?\n\nOnce upon a time some guy or guys go to japan notice the creativity of the crepes in Harajuku (or wherever), come back here, hire Japanese ESL students, add a word in kanji (that they themselves could not read or write) on their window and start selling \"Japanese\" crepes. \n\nHate to break it to you: but stuffing strawberry or tea or red beans or whatever into a crepe does not make it Japanese much less make it \"authentic.\" Japanese crepes are made with 'mochi.' Never heard of it? Apparently, neither have the owners (I hope, or else they are making stuff up).\nOf course, just being a shop trying to make a buck the owners have little conviction and are already drifting towards other ventures.\n\nAside from the very ordinary and very overpriced and expensive crepes, they have parfaits and cake. \nThe other thing is I am not into whipped cream. That is why I much prefer a place like Garni where the cream puffs and other pastry is made with actual cream.\n\nThe atmosphere is depressing (and not just because a slice is $8, which makes Uncle Tetsu look like a good deal in comparison) as next to no effort has gone into making the store a pleasant experience. I was out as soon as I could not because I was sad I paid $20, but also because the store looks like an old bathroom with three small tables and six chairs. \n\nThis store is as exciting and compelling and authentic and Japanese as all the Chinese sushi places, Korean izakayas and that North York place owned, run and staffed by Koreans selling \"authentic\" udon to masses of yelp reviewers. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but reviews are useless if they are not honest and informative and Yelp is not Bento box or BlogTo where anything and everything is super duper fantastic either out of sheer ignorance or to cater to potential advertisers.
