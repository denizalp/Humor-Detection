It was our first time in PHX and we decided to sign up for the 1 day Grand Canyon-Sedona-Navajo Nation tour.  One big reason we decided on this tour company is that they will pick you from your hotel.  And promptly at 6:25am, our guide was at our hotel.  Let's say, this was the best decision to have taken this tour (partially because we were out late the night before and it took a lot of pressure off of us to do the drive).  We picked up a few more passengers and as the day progressed, we all settled in.  \n\nOur guide, Les gave us a bunch of information, he really was super knowledgeable about AZ and the Grand Canyon.  He had answers to just about everything and tons of suggestions for other sites to see.  He was able to secure a last minute Grand Canyon helicopter trip for us.\n\nOur first stop was in the town\/city of Sedona, we were able to walk around the town while Les picked up our lunches, which we could eat along the way or have a nice picnic on the rim of the Canyon.  Sedona is a cute, touristy town, and we were very pleased to find a Starbucks. ;)  After about 30 minutes we were on our way to view the famous Red Rocks of Sedona.  We only spent about 15-20 minutes, but I now want to return to hike it.\n\nOur next stop was at the heliport for our Grand Canyon helicopter tour.  While most of the group was at doing the helicopter tour, those who opted out were able to spend some time in the Canyon village\n\nWhen the helicopter tours were done, we proceeded to stops along the south rim of the Grand Canyon.  We stopped at the Yavapai Point and Geology Museum and Lipan point.  Both spots showcased sweeping views of the South Rim.  I really can't comment on this, you just have to experience it yourself.  At the museum, Les was kind enough to show us our helicopter route on the 3-D model.  At each stop we spent about 20-30 minutes.\n\nOur last stop was a the Navajo Nation to buy trinkets, food, and other items.  And then off to Phoenix.  \n\nOverall, we were gone from 6:30am to 8:00 pm.  It was a long day, but well worth the money spent, especially since it was our first time in AZ.\n\nThe tour really just gives you a taste of what Sedona and the Grand Canyon has to offer and I highly recommend doing both this tour and the helicopter tour.  We definitely want to go back.  I would have preferred to spend more time in Sedona and the Grand Canyon over the stop at the Navajo Nation, but it was a really great experience.
