I make jewelery. \nI need to purchase supplies for the pieces that I give to my friends (and occasionally sell) and I really don't have a shop that I can rely upon to get the finest quality items. \nUntil now. \nBelieve me, I have gone all over Toronto, Windsor and London to source out great finds. Fancy Gems is one of the only shops that is reasonably and appropriately priced, friendly (!!!!!) and well organized. \nThey have a beautiful selection of quality gemstones at the front of the store, surrounding multiple displays of findings within the centre. \nMoving into the store, you reach a lovely array of cultured and fresh water pearls (my favourite!). \nThey have a vast assortment of high quality metal findings toward the back, as well as higher end gemstones. \nIn the basement is an absurd amount of sale items.  I thought it was perfect to have to go down gold speckled staircase to reach these pieces!\nKimberly (Assistant Manager) was inquisitive, helpful and complimentary. \nIt is rare that you can find someone in a Bead store that possesses all these qualities. \nMy only complaint is that they have a very tiny selection of Swarovski crystals. \nI am on a creative spurt, fueled by the need to go back to Fancy Gems and Accessories and purchase more!
