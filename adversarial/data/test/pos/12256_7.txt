Came here upon a recommendation of a Turkish friend and only to try the Iskender kebab. This was something I'd never had before so wanted to find out what the whole fuss was about. I'm guessing it's a very popular kebab with Turkish people. The rest on their menu is all too familiar for me. Hence my little trip all the way there was justified lol. \n\nThe place itself is an OK place, casual, laid back and full of Turkish vibe. Big screen TV playing on moderate volume, you can hear all kinds of Turkish music. Not a bad place for a casual lunch or dinner in general. \n\nMy Iskender kebab gets a 4 star. I wasn't wowed and wasn't disappointed either. My friend warned me saying what you get here in terms of taste vs the one offered in Turkey, specifically in the city of Bursa.... big difference. Ah well, I'm not travelling to Turkey for that so going to settle with this. \n\nOverall, I was satisfied with my dish, basically it's a mix of two kinds of meat, lamb and beef gyro style laid on top of bed of what looked like Afghan bread, cut into bite sizes topped with tasty tomato sauce. I think this is the only kebab you eat with plain yogurt and again I have to check online to see if this is the authentic way of doing it. Portion was good but $16 plus tax and tip which comes to $21 and change with no drink, I found it to be just a little overpriced. I'm guessing because it contains lamb meat. \n\nIt loses one star though for missing paper towel dispenser in the washroom, salt, pepper and napkins not found on every table and also staff not attentive. I wasn't even asked if I wanted to drink something nor offered a standard glass of water. Overall, I'd stop by here again if in the hood to try other food. Where I come from, they're all too similar to me but sure theirs has a different twist. Recommend? Yes. Worth the discovery.
