3.5\n\nIt's going to be hard to impress a Tennessean with BBQ that's not from\/in a southern state but Bootleggers gets an 'A' for effort... and for moonshine. I didn't know what to expect when walking through the doors on a surprisingly chilly Wednesday night but tptb at Bootleggers was already on top of it, having heaters strewn about the dining room. If you're not happy with the service at Bootleggers, you're probably very hard to impress. I experienced a meal full of smiles and suggestions. Despite waiting on a large group, the servers never appeared stressed, harried or cranky. They definitely added to the experience.\n\nAlso starting things off on a right note: the chips & guacamole. It sounds basic. It tasted incredible. My table fought over the app. I would have made more of a valiant attempt to eat them all if I weren't already a few glasses deep in to the moonshine. Again, as a Tennessean, it's nice to see other people appreciate moonshine (even if mass produced, bottled and expensive moonshine isn't 'moonshine'). Bootleggers has some good stuff at the ready. I'd suggest sipping it. Shooting it is a bad idea that will lead to bad decisions and a rough morning. For my meal, I opted for the pulled pork. I don't eat a lot of pork these days but I was looking for a gluten-free option that wouldn't cause a lot of waves. Pulled pork, it was. I received a mountain of food. If you leave Bootleggers hungry, there's a medical issue. My pork was good. I thought the texture was a tad fatty\/mealy but I know people who prefer their shoulder that way. For being a smokehouse, I didn't get a ton of smoke from the meat but thought that the sauces (try 'em all) amplified the base flavor of the meat. The sauce wasn't there to mask anything. The fries that came with were inoffensive and pleasant. I would have preferred a touch more aggressive seasoning but, again, I realize mileage may vary.\n\nI thought this area of Scottsdale was more lively than the Entertainment District in which I was staying. If back in the area, I'd like to explore the options more in depth. And, if back in the area, I'd probably come back for moonshine, guac and service with a smile.
