Love their extremely fresh sushi most of them imported from Japan. \nBeen trying to booked at other sushi but it's full. No regret I found this gem. The new edomae sushi. I really enjoy all the fish of that day menu. And I barely post any review unless it's important!\nGood luck to find their place!
