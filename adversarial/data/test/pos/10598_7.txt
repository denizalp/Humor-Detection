Kub Khao is tucked in the corner of a tiny plaza beside the gas station. Hard to miss if you don't look hard enough!\n\nThought the place was tiny when I first walked into the store, until we were told to go to the back. The layout of the restaurant is weird, with unmatching tables and chairs. Our server was a nice and young lady. She brought us some water and took our order. \n\nFood didn't take too long of a wait to arrive. We got the mango salad to start and I ordered the duck curry with medium spice. The mango salad was good, although a bit too salty. Generous duck pieces filled with loads of veggies in the curry. It was delicious but also a bit too salty. I find medium spiciness to be the perfect amount of spiciness for me, but my brother did find it extremely spicy.\n\nWe were done with our food but it took us a while to spot our server and ask for the bill. The bill also took quite a bit of of time to arrive. She then came back with the machine. As I was punching in my tips and pin, our server left our dining area. I wanted to stay seated and wait until our server comes around to hand her the machine, but it turned into an almost 10 minute wait. I had to leave the machine with my untorn receipt on the table.
