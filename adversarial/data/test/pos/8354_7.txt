I grew up starting my day with a roll & butter or my favorite a bagel with butter. I know what you're thinking, the same thought I had, simple find a great bagel shop in Arizona and start your day right. \n\nFinding a ordinary bagel is easy, regardless of where you live. Finding a great bagel that's boiled, baked and given a generous schmear of  butter or cream cheese is tough in these parts, that is until I found  Bagels Gourmet .\n\nThe bagels at Hot Bagel Gourmet are deliciously fresh.  These bagel are everything a bagel should be.  The bagel's are crispy, chewy,  perfection.\n\nIf you're ever in the area and want to taste  delicious bagels, and expeirebce great customer service, stop in.  You won't be disappointed.
