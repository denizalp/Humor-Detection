Non existent payouts. Impossible to win.\n\nFolks don't be fooled. This place and others like it exist for two reasons.\n\nSomewhere for gambling addicts to go to lose their money.\n\nOverflow for tourists when the strip hotels are booked or high priced. \n\nNo tourist in their right mind would stay or play here if they had a choice of staying on the strip.\n\nLike another reviewer stated, they need to be investigated by the Nevada Gaming Commission. Station casinos cheat and their payouts are below the minimum threshold.
