I had the fortune to come here last week for happy hour and WOW, was I blown away. This is the (relatively) undiscovered gem of Playhouse Square. Easily my new go-to happy hour spot in Cleveland. The food was exceptional, service was first class (shout out to Dizzy for providing the best and most knowledgeable service I've received east of the Mississippi) and the restaurant is beautiful. We arrived around 5:30 and the place was relatively quiet but by 6:30 it was bumping with pre-theatre goers. The happy hour menu was a representative snapshot of the larger menu, focusing on tasty small bites (I mean this in a good way, not the overpriced, underportioned tapas way). In addition, they had a wide variety of unique seasonal cocktails, curated craft beers and ciders, and top notch wines (at reasonable prices).\n\nFirst off, the drinks: the red and white on happy hour were both very good, great value, and several notches above the usual house or table wine you get for happy hour. The seasonal cocktail was their take on the cosmo, made with infused alcohol and some type of pressed apple - amazing!\n\nThe food is exceptional and easily worth a detour if you're in the area.\n1) Oysters: YES PLEASE! Incredibly fresh, only in-season varietals offered, and served with a special house sauce, and a bargain at $1. Order a dozen and thank me later.\n2) Deviled Eggs:  usually not my swag but wow were these good.\n3) Tuna Tartar:  order one of these to share. Then when your dining partner goes to the bathroom order another and eat it before they get back. Huge amount of fresh tuna, caviar, and their unique fried focaccia. I could eat this for days.\n4) Pork Belly Steamed Buns:  the best ever, hands down. I don't care how much anyone says they like Noodlecat or any other pork belly bun, these are the champion. Large hunks of pork belly, well-seasoned, with just enough bun to call it a steamed bun without being doughy (looking at you Noodlecat).\n5) Cheese Board: Last but not least, this is a steal. Seriously, where else do you get fresh fruit, sweet & spicy nuts, THREE kinds of cheese, fried focaccia, AND fig preserves (all of which were incredibly tasty) for the low, low price of $8? Only at Bin 216 I tell you.\n\nSo to sum up, come here on a Friday night (or a Wednesday if Jazz is your thing), eat your heart out, warm up with a few drinks in an awesome restaurant, and then hit the town. Bin 216 is representative of everything Cleveland has to offer. Classy, unpretentious, great vibe, stellar service, excellent food, all at bargain prices.
