Cleaner with less riffraff than some 99s towards downtown, my 77 year old mom and I always pick up some bargains, like tiramisu or pre packaged, California grown produce ( eggplant, garlic, ginger,etc), before trudging across the melting blacktop towards Fresh & Easy. \n\nOne thing I like about 99c stores is the shambolic displays kinda force you to encounter goods you wouldnt elsewhere - provided they dont first shift imperceptibly and crush you in North America's most steeply discounted avalanche.  For example, this place had a section of, like, a thousand cans of  a retro lemonade - iced tea combo called \"Arnold Palmer\". Each can featured a cool B&W photo of the famous golfer; plus the drink was delish. I plan to return someday to actually buy a can. \n\nLook for me, wont you?  I'll be the yellow toothed loner, shoplifting eggplants and garlic up my cargo shorts, ogling off brand cans of tea. Hey ladies, let's get acquainted!
