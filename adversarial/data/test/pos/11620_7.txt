Really, what's not to love about this place?  It encompasses my two biggest in one spot: Coffee and wine.  Wine AND coffee?  In the same place?  YES.\n\nA few of my girlfriends and I stopped in Barrique's before hitting the Farmer's Market at the capitol building Saturday morning.  It was freezing cold and on the verge of an early season snowstorm, so we were not only amped to fill our rumbling bellies, but we were craving some hot, yummy drinks to start the day.  Since you never know what you're going to get at the Farmer's Market, we decided Barrique's was the best bet for some tasty delights before perusing all the produce at the market.\n\nThe coffee menu has all the right stuff like lattes and cappuccinos, but since I'm off the coffee for awhile, I decided on hot tea.  \"I'll take a green tea, please,\" I tell the gal behind the counter.  \"Which one would you like?\" she says.  Umm... MORE than one green tea option?  Yay!  I settled on a lovely, fragrant orange blossom green tea that was so delicious I was actually a little sad when it was all in my belly.\n\nThe eats aren't too shabby, either.  I ordered the granola and I was happy to see it was jam packed with a great variety of dried fruits.  Add some skim milk and I was full and content.  While I didn't indulge in the pastries, my friends assured me they are fabulous.  My girl Steph was eating this blueberry pastry thing that looked incredible.\n\nOh, and did I mention this is ALSO a wine store?  They have a huge variety of wines (including organic options - hey, this IS Madison) so I can't imagine someone wouldn't find what they need.\n\nKeep up the good work, Madison and Barrique's.  You're tops!
