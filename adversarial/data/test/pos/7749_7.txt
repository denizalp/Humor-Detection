We came here on Saturday afternoon and we thought it was great!   \n   We had coupons so admission was very reasonable.  The food in our minds was great! It is not sit down Family owned Italian, but hey it is a festival.!!          It was good for that venue.    Some of the other reviews say, it was dirty. I have to disagree with that. Yes, it is dusty... It is AZ and it is Spring and the wind blows.    What can you do?   Any time you take the family out it is very costly. It is much less expensive than the AZ State fair.   The best part was the entertainment. As the day went on into evening it was very good.  Philly Cuzz, who was great! The Sinatra 's ( A real Vegas act), Tony Sacca and many  more. A lot of the singers were from Italy, a lot from Vegas.   Even Louis Prima's daughter performed.\n  I thought it was a wonderful effort on everyone's part. The food was excellent except for the Garlic fries.  I do not remember the name of the booth, but it was not too good.   But, everything else was fantastic! \nEven free parking!  Loved it!
