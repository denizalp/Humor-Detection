Not a very girl friendly hotel. Why? \n\nLACK OF FULL OF LENGTH MIRRORS.\n\nOh there's one on the inside of the closet door, but there's poor lighting where the closet is and not to mention there's some ugly overlay on top of it. You can't see yourself at all! \n\nOtherwise the suites are swanky. You can plug your iPod into the wall and jam out to your tunes while getting ready. Couches are huge and comfy. So are the beds.
