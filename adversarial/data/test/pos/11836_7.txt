Did someone say tacos?! I'm always down for some good Mexican food, and Bakersfield left a fantastic first impression on me. I loved the ambiance of the place. Super trendy with a classier vibe yet I won't feel out of place dining in jeans and a tee. It was actually very reminiscent of Tako, a restaurant few blocks over.  \n\nIf you only come for one thing, get the chips and guac! Best guac I've had in my life (seriously!). It's made in-house and prepared fresh every thirty minutes. Ah-mazing!\n\nHighly recommend the Papas Tostada for anyone looking for a meatless option. It's a crispy tortilla on a bed of shredded lettuce that is piled with black beans, crispy potatoes, salsa, guac, and poblano. For only $7, I was expecting a smaller portion, but the tostada filled even my black hole of a stomach. So delicious I wanted to cry. \n\nService was phenomenal from start to finish. We were seated immediately as we entered, and our waitress was very bubbly and friendly. She gave many good tips about what to select off the menu and pointed out the best vegetarian options. Although we came during the lunch rush, the food came out pretty quickly. \n\nThere you have it. Fantastic food, great ambiance, stellar customer service. Bakersfield's got the whole package and my stamp of approval. I will be back soon for those tacos!
