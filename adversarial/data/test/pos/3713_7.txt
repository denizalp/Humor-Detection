My parents bought a timeshare here while it was being built.  It is not walking distance from the active part of the strip.  The lobby and the rooms are nice enough, but I suspect they were cheap about certain things.  \n\nWe stayed in a two bedroom two bathroom suite.  My first shower turned into a bath because of plumbing problems, but they came up quickly to fix it.  The suite was decent sized and bedrooms were far apart - which I think is VERY important.\n\nThere isn't any decent food on site.  Luckily there was a Chipotle within walking distance.\n\nThe sales people are like vultures, I was only safe because I was a seemingly single woman who looks young.  Even on the strip they harass people, I finally asked why no one was bugging me and someone said it was because I didn't have a man with me.  I was happy not to be trapped, but how sexist!\n\nMy last night I was in the bar and a sleazy guy was making his rounds.  When I showed my disinterest he mocked me for not wearing makeup and having my hair tied back.  Then the drunken jerk started yelling at the band, telling them they suck and generally being nasty.  I find out later, he is one of the SALES people.\n\nI'd stay there again, because it's free for me - but they need to get their act together.
