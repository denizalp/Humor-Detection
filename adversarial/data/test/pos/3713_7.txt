I cannot say enough about this place. It not only provided us with a fantastic meal, but it cured my best friend's broken heart. \n\nFood:\nFalafel with hummus, beef & lamb kabob and chicken breast were excellent choices. As for sides, the white cabbage really stood out. Delicious! \n\nService:\nAttentive and attractive pretty much says it all. Look for Sean.
