As far as drug stores go, the Carle RxExpress here is pretty bare-bones, but they do have the essentials, and I don't think it's anything less than what you'd expect from a clinic's in-house pharmacy. I haven't had any issues at all with the pharmacy itself, and the folks there work hard to get you what you need if they don't have a particular medication in stock. Plus, they have a drive-thru, which is nice. Just be sure you get there before they close at 6:00! In the end, going here for my pharmacy needs was a no-brainer (albeit a completely subjective no-brainer) since it's in the same building as my doctor and it's right down the street from my house.\n\nOh, and here's a good bonus: if you choose to wait for your prescription, there's a little cafe and some comfy chairs right out in the hallway. Beat that, Walgreens!\n\nAs for the rest of the clinic, the building is nice and new and has a friendly open layout. There are computer check-in systems, comfortable waiting areas, free wi-fi, and everyone has seemed pretty friendly. I haven't tried the above-mentioned cafe yet...but, you know, having it there is kind of a nice touch.
