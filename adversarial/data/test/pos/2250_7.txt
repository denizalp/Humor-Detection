I stopped in for a quick breakfast sandwich.  I ordered a croissant with chicken and bacon.  Service was a little slow. The cashier was friendly enough. The place was clean and had a good sanitation grade posted.  My food was pretty good. Everything was what I expected from Duncan.  This location also offers ice cream. The dining area has plenty of seating.
