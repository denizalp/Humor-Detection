YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(362\/365) \"It's MORE Than Sugar!)\n\nIt's your typical kitschy, novelty candy store with a mix of retro sweets, gummi selections, chocolates, a splash of cool, funky, and hilarious stuff, kinda like a combination of bits from  Sugar Factory, Grandma Daisy's, and Rocket Fizz.\n\nToys, gadgets, and stuffed animals are among other options you may purchase other than sugary sweet treats here, and if you need more than your standard sized candy bar, those Mega Bars are available too, and are great for sharing....or not.\n\nGreat spot to grab some candy for the movies(Regal Cinemas is in the vicinity)\nbut parents, beware of the adult themed selections that are also available. You may have to suffer the embarrassment of your kid running up to you wanting a Colon Blow or even a Di@k In A Box! Yes, they have them here. You have been warned! ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu  3.75
