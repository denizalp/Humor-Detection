I have been here twice. The first time I was very pleased with my service so I came back. This time around I was completely dissatisfied. My finger was split open by the drill and then she poured alcohol on it!!! She painted a different color on my toes than what I asked for, so my toes are a lighter shade of pink than my nails. The atmosphere is very dull. A lot of misunderstandings and communication issues. I will not be going back again!
