I show up 20 minutes early for my appointment and all the lights in the entire place are completely out. When asked why there were no lights, the man at the counter said \"save power.\" The elderly man at the front desk had to call employees to come in even though we had reservations for 7:30. Then they put my mom and grandmother in one room, and me by myself to soak. I'm soaking for 15 minutes and no one comes into my room. So I put on my shoes and go into my mom and grandmas room to ask where my masseuse is. The elderly man says \"Traffic.\" I go back and soak and at 7:55, 25 minutes after my appointment was scheduled, still no masseuse, I get up and leave. My mom later told me that my masseuse never showed up. Also the elderly man asked me if if had a baby which was hugely insulting. This place when from good to decent to shit.
