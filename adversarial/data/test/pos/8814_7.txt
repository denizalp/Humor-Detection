The salon is lovely. I never would have discovered this little gem had I not come to see the best colorist in town Daniel. \n\nMy mother and I have been going to Daniel for well over 20 years and faithfully follow him to wherever he lands.\n\n(Like seriously I would let him color my hair in a gas station bathroom if that's what it took haha.)\n\nNeedless to say this salon is very nice, the decor is chic modern. The chairs in the reception area were very comfortable and the energy when you walk in is very contagious. The other stylists seemed nice and friendly. Daniel works magic with color, I am very picky about who touches my hair and he has never let me down. Sometimes he books up quickly so make sure you call in advance, he is well worth the wait.
