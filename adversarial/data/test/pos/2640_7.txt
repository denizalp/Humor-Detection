One of the coolest airports I have ever been to. I usually go through Detroit airport for trips. My parents wanted the cheapest trip for everyone. We got tickets through Sunwing which was all-inclusive for our Cancun trup. It was cheaper to go through Toronto than Detroit, by far. I'm talking hundreds of dollars saved. So we decided to drive to Toronto and pay for our car at this parking place we found. It was great. The experience was amazing because of the drive.\n\nWhen we got there, everyone was so helpful. My parents do not speak perfect english, and the lady explained everything to her. She was patient and kind with the bagging. She told us where to weigh our bags just in case. My sister's bag was actually a little too heavy, but luckily my mom had room in one of the other luggages, so we quickly fixed that. Once we were ready, we got in line for check in. Everything went by super smoothly. There wasn't a long wait, and this employee was polite too. \n\nMy dad went in at a separate counter and he did not know where to go. She showed him his ticket and the area to walk through. She then pointed where he goes for tsa and the closest one to our plain. \n\nAfter finishing up, we saw an amazing airport with shops and places to eat. Just the seating area for our flight was great. The couches and lounge chairs looked expensive and comfortable. There was tv's everywhere and ipads on every high up table. Children and adults can play games. Some are free and others you have to buy. The free games you can play and earn points for free items at the airport. For example, food and headphones. You can even order food from the mini restaurant stations nearby off of the ipad. It shows the options on the list. You can choose any and look at the menu and prices. I thought that was pretty awesome. You can also just walk around and look, which is what we did because of time. The floors were tile and shiny clean in the other areas. Every mini food area was clean. There was so many options to choose from.\n\nDon't even get me started on the restrooms. The restrooms were the cleanest and nicest restrooms I have ever seen. It even smelled nice. I was impressed. I didn't think I would enjoy an airport experience so much. My parents have since gone through this airport for all of their other international trips.
