If I wanted undercooked, hastily put together, raw dough in the middle pizza, I'd let my three year old niece do it.\nOh, wait. She would have adult supervision, unlike this place.\nDirty workers, disgusting food, poor service.\nYou should be ashamed.\nRaw pizza in the center. A slop of sauce on one side, a ton of toppings thrown in the middle... Yet the outside crust was cooked. So are the crusts pre cooked? And this was a personal pan. Really?!\nNasty food, terrible slow service, managers don't care.\nSeriously, you don't care. We've contacted you about this several times and you don't care.\nIndifference I would say is the word for it.\nIf you are into salmonella, eat here!\nBut, if you want good pizza and good service...\nGo to Lido's.
