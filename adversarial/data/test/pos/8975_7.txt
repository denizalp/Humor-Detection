If you combine this mall with the small big box complex across the street (which includes an Old Navy, a Walmart, a Home Depot, a Chapters, etc), Sherway Gardens presents a pretty compelling shopping mecca. Sherway is what I term a \"left hand mall\", after the maze solving  algorithm where you place your left hand on a wall and never remove it. In most mazes, you'll eventually trace every part of the maze and find your way out. Left hand malls, by extension, are so big you kind of need to follow the left hand rule to make sure you don't miss a part.\n\nAside from the standard anchors (sears and the bay) you'll find a two story Sporting Life and a Holt Renfrew. Sporting Life is always a great place to get your snob appeal sporting wear like Hugo Boss. Holt Renfrew I just like to cut through to the parking lot and subtely oogle the makeup ladies.\n\nWhat's sort of nice about this mall are the vast number of comfy chairs available for relaxing in with a coffee or for torturing Pelagians into confessing their heinous sin of heresy and reject the works of the ungodly.\n\nThe food court is quite large, under a big tent. There's a manchu wok.
