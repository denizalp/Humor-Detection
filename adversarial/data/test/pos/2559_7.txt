Just a quick update. \nAs of writing effective now. \nNEW: Owners \nNEW: now open on Sundays! \nNEW: OPEN til 9pm\nNEW: Protein: added 6oz choice\nNEW: choice of salad and now veggies! \nNEW: Choice of rice and now potatoes! \nNEW: on UberEats! \n\nLIKE: CHOICES for potatoes, sweet or white potatoes \n\nLIKE: CHOICES for veggies, asparagus, zucchini or mixed \n\nNOT crazy about the prices charged or the change of packaging in Styrofoam instead of plastic containers. But I get it..to cut costs, but lunch here is pricier now. Still good eats though!
