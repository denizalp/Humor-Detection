My wife and I went to the Benedum to see Giselle that was performed by the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre.  This is the third show that we have seen from the Pittsburgh Ballet and it was a great performance.\n We were seated close to the stage this time and you can really see their talent in full display that close. \n\n     Giselle is a ballet about a girl named Giselle, who dies of a broken heart after discovering her lover is actually a Count and supposed to be wed to another woman.  The count first disguised himself as a peasant and he falls in love with Giselle.  Then the Huntsman ( who is in love with Giselle too) sees there is something not right with Albrecht disguised as a peasant.  He eventually exposes the Count of his lie and Giselle who has a faint heart cannot take the pain of the real truth about the Count her lover.  This was all in Act I. I enjoyed Act I better than Act II.  Act II was good but it was more of a battle with the afterlife involving the huntsman, and Giselle trying to save Albrecht from a evil queen.\n\n     Overall I really enjoyed the show.  The girl who plays Giselle was very talented.  I don't know specifics on ballet theatre but I was really impressed by her dancing.  Her spinning and balancing on one foot for a long time was amazing.  The other main performances were just as good.  We've seen some of the same people in Peter Pan and the Nut Cracker and their talent it is very impressive.\n\n     The orchestra was great too.  I still have a couple of their songs pleasantly stuck in my head.  Guys if you have never taken your girl to the theatre try out the Pittsburgh ballet.  Your girl will love it and you will learn to enjoy it too.  It's a good date and it's better than the usual going to the movies or going to a sporting event.  You won't be disappointed!
