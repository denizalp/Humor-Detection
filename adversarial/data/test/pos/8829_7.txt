This is the worst bar and lamest restaurant in Vegas. You have be a nerd or loser to come to Vegas and dive into this hole known as: Herbs and Rye. \n\nYou're in Vegas...\nAnd you're going to Herbs and Rye- man, your life sucks.\nEverything about this bar sucks and they are dishonest. I use to be dragged out to this place with a corny biz partner from the Midwest who liked its chic and drab garage-like d√©cor and setting. The drinks were always watered down and food served cold as well as the order totally WRONG about 60% of the time. The staff never cared and viewed no one as regulars. \n\nIf you come here to have fun after 6:00PM you have officially peaked in your life. Its downhill from here. You could go to any bar in Wisconsin or South Dakota and have the same experience. \n\nThe owners should tear the place down and remodel it to be a normal Vegas bar like everywhere else that is trying to attract young people with money. Hahaha, who invested in that place?
