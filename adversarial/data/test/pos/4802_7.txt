This has to be the weirdest massage experience I've had. The masseuse talked the ENTIRE time about everything from his childhood to how much he gets paid. On top of that it was not a good massage, I left with a lot of bruises. I definitely would not recommend getting a massage. \nThe eyebrow wax was just fine, which is why I gave it  2 stars.
