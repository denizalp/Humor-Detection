I read the bad reviews and I believe them. However, it's not the experience I have had on Monday, Wednesday or today Thursday. One thing is for certain, good looking young gals and guys flock to this, very busy, location. \nThe beer is constantly COLD (lol) and the service is friendly and attentive. \nI don't know really where they fail for me. Perhaps I have been coming here far too long to notice, but, I get treated like a regular whenever I come here. This place is still a family friendly joint and I like bringing friends here. \nThe ONE THING that truly sucks is the parking. I almost forgot to mention that prior to this week I used to Uber here. There is a five minute wait for a parking spot. It does not help to have Uhaul next door being complete AH over parking spots. I would usually have to wait or back into the side parking to park. The parking really SUCKS. But, the eye candy and their chicken wings keep me coming here. \nI don't wish to take away from the poor reviews because those bad reviews make a restaurant better. \nNonetheless, I still think of this place as a great sports bar and a fun place to share a meal with friends.
