Typical customer of Little Spoon: OMG I can walk to Little Spoon and it is soooooo good !!!!! :) !!!!\n\nReality:  This place is awful. Once the parking is fixed and landlord can jack rent they are out of business.  \n\nHave been twice. Lunch and breakfast.  Lunch was fine average. Wasn't crowded and food was average.  Those were the positives.  Negatives were you leave hungry and prices are absurd.  If you want a $25 meal and then have to find your second lunch before heading back to work, definitely hit this place up. \n\nBrunch was an unmitigated disaster. I can walk to this place, and parking is non-existent as stated in other reviews, but I harbor no positive vibe.  Waitstaff is indifferent at best. They seem to believe the restaurant is a desirable place to eat and has good food, service and value. They are clearly confused.  Eggs were dry. Bread was stale. Bacon tasted like it was boiled before it was cooked. But at least I got to hear about everybody in the neighborhood's issues on this fine weekend morning as the tables are stacked on top of one another.  At least the waiters have ink, tight pants and mustaches. That makes me feel trendy!\n\nThis space will eventually have a good dining experience in it. Little Spoon will not be it.
