I did not enjoy my experience there (been there three times) and let me explain why. The girl has no experience in hairstyling, the guy on the other hand does have some sense of style. The material they use are very cheap and at the end of every haircut i end up with a bunch of hair on me that would make me itch all day. For God's sake they use toilet paper to cover you neck! \nAnyway i would not recommend  it. Spend an extra 5 minute researching and you will find a better place.
