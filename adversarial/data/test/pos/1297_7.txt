UPDATE!!! If at all possible I could leave a negative star rating you bet this company would get it! \n\nSo, after reading through yelpers comments I reread my contract for those \"additional charges\" and to my surprise there were a few that I specifically advs the agent I didn't need, i.e. Road side assistance and collision (My ins. Covers me)  I called customer service and she gave me the whole \"well ma'am you read the contract and initialed\"...  which, yes I am guilty because I was already annoyed at the counter so I did, my mistake! \n\nAnyways she advised me to come in and redo my contract and the that they will just charge me the 24hours because I was already in possession of the vehicle and they will adjust my contract w\/out the additional charges. \n\nFast forward same evening I go into their office and their counter is closed so I head down into the garage where the checkout counter isolated and I I get Jimmie.... Told him the situation and he printed out my new contract and advised me the 24 hour charge is fifty and some change and the remaining days w\/out the additional charges comes out to $101.00 or something like that... Wait, what?!? That's the exact same price the afternoon agent gave me that included the additional charges & discount! \n\nHe's telling me the noon agent wasn't suppose to knock off this and that and this and that (1 ex. She charged me $5.00 per add. Driver and now he's charging me $10.00) Blah blah blah blah! Lol I'm livid at this point and told him well that's something he needs to discuss with his colleague; not me. He kept saying per contract... Well Jimmie Obviously something isn't correct! because I'm holding two separate conflicting contract from the same company and same office but just from two agents from a different shift. So I asked for his supervisor and guess what?! There's no managers! Why? Because per Mr. Jimmie they're at home sleeping so there just isn't one on duty. Well I don't want to talk to Jimmie because obviously we're not getting  anywhere! \n\nJust as persistent as he is there isn't one; I'm just as persistent in seeing one. So he asks me to wait he'll contact someone, then his phone rings and he picks it up and guess what!!? It's another passenger about charges discrepancies! He hangs up then tells me to come back tomorrow, NO the fuck I won't! We need to figure this out now or give me a refund... Guess what now!!? He agrees! Wait what?! According to the afternoon agent I wasn't  able to cancel earlier because I prepaid and I was already w\/in the 48 hour window! But Jimmie, good ol Jimmie gave me a refund of my remaining days. \n\nThis company is ASS backwards and needs to get their shit together! What a fuckin RIP OFF!
