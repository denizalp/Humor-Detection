Some parts of the aiport are more updated than others. Terminal E was impressive: lots of charging stations, healthy food options, and decent shopping. Howeve,r taking an international flight here is more choatic and time consuming that it needs to be.  The have a total of 4 security lines for all the flights going to the US and there is very little direction provided on where to go and what line to get behind. Looks a bit understaffed. Once you get through the process, the gate area was just fine and I really enjoyed the shopping and food there.
