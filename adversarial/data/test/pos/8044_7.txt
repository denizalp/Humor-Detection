Starbucks Rewards program changes:  Gold Level, you get a free drink at 12 stars -- not 15 like before.\nNo more postcards you used get in the mail telling you about your free drink. You get an email instead. \nYou no longer get a free tall beverage when you buy your pound of coffee.\n Also, you'll no longer be able to add a syrup or soy milk for free. \nNow you get to choose if you want to use your reward on food or drinks....\n\nGive me free soy back! Yes I know, it's sounds like I'm whining for something free, well, I am! \n\nThis is the Starbucks location I frequent the most as its on my way to work, so I'm here 3 days a week. I've  seen many people come and go here, I had my favorites and my not so favorites. I feel bad for not knowing the young lad at the drive thru, who has gotten to know me over the drive thru, my drink and food order is always 100% correct with him, he's always friendly. Now, there is a new employee, she's been there a couple months, middle aged with an accent, she is grumpy, never cracks a smile, usually gets my drink order wrong along with my food order, and she gets an attitude if I ask for something, when you're ordering a breakfast sandwich, do I need to ask for a napkin?? Or if I want the green stopper, can I get it without a fowl look? Starbucks is my reward to myself for going to work, yes I realize how pathetic that sounds, but I reward myself a lot with food and drinks. So get a different job if customer service isn't for you!
