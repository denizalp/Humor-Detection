Just relocated to Pittsburgh (2010) and heard about this place. Saw two concerts (Bilal and Tobbey Boney) for under $30 bucks each.  The drinks are yummy  plue DIRT CHEAP!   The owner ( dude with a fro\/think beard) is really nice.  Heck, he's actually pretty hot in a retro\/hip\/techno\/neo soul kinda way.  If I wasn't a lesbo...I'd ******.......******** him. hahaha
