Food was mediocre at best.  Steaks are so large that splitting them is the only rational option.  German  potatoes came out burnt.  Why they thought it was ok to serve them was beyond me.  They replaced them with lumpy mashed which was an improvement but still nothing to charge $8 for.   \n\nBread options unremarkable.   \n\nNo cucumbers in the entire restaurant for my water, which, ok they've only been open 3 weeks but really?   \n\nService was good since we were only a handful of diners.  \n\nWaiter didn't know how to describe one of the only two glasses of white wine available by the glass.   \n\nNo valet parking.   \n\nSteaks were a highlight.  Great flavor, slight char.   \n\nFor these prices if they don't fix the portion sizes and improve the sides they won't be in business for long.  There are way too many other great Valley steakhouses in this price range.
