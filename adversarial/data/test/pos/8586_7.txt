Not for the easily offended.  Fun atmosphere.  Super loud.  Cash only.  This is a no BS type of place.  We saw two guys get laughed\/kicked out of the bar for asking for appletinis.  Our bartender was cool.  She's what made it fun for us.  Know what to expect and you'll have a good time.  \n\nSecurity were kinda dicks.  They get very aggressive over small things. This was in the afternoon with very few people in the bar.  I imagine it is worse at night.
