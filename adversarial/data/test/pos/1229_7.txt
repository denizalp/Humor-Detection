I was prepared for the tropical decor when we went in but it's borderline cheezball and just felt embarrassing to be in after awhile. I'm not a fan of clutter and there was stuff everywhere! \n\n  I had the pedicure, milk & honey treatment, and found it was very soothing and thought it was worth the upcharge. I did think however, that the gel-manicure was a bit too expensive.  But not sure I'll ever know which service cost the most because they did not break it down for me when I checked out and the girl had problems using the register and things took too long already and we were running out of time. \n\n I had  a gel manicure + milk & honey pedicure and it came out to a whopping $80!!!! And for this entire experience to be in a strip mall next to Albertson's I did not find the charges to be valid.  If you are like me and you need a manicure about twice a month this is just not going to cut it.  For that insane pricing I want the manicurist to come to my home and not me driving out of my way.  The instruments seemed to be taken out of sterilized packs so that was nice to see. But I'm sure they are not the only place in town that sterilizes their instruments.
