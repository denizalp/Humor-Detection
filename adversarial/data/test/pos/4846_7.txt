Cute place in a ghetto surroundings. As I walk from the parking lot about 3 people that look like cocaine addicts already approached me. After we got our order we sat at the tables outside, we tried sitting there then we were like \"uhhhhhh nope. Lets go back inside\" \n\nAside from the location, the milk tea and bubble waffle was great!! Ive been wanting to try the bubble waffle and I finally found a place!\n\nI ordered papaya milk tea also and I thought its going to be gross but it was actually delicious!!! \nAfter posting it on IG a lot of people are actually excited to go there (Itea ,You're welcome) lol
