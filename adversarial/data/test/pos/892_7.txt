Right by my gate!!! Perfect!\n\nFirst, the girl working the bar (damn I wished I remembered her name) immediately acknowledged me as soon as I walked up even though she was already in the midst of serving other customers. I was gonna order a preflight vodka soda when I saw h r making a Bloody Mary and it looked like she was actually putting a lot of TLC and I remembered I hadn't had any lunch so I quickly changed my order. Meal in a glass! Spicy and tasty! I noticed she acknowledged everyone that came up no matter how busy she was too.\n\nIs this a fancy place... No. Do they have a huge selection... No. Is it great pricing... Absolutely not. But you are in the airport... Duh!\n\nWhat they have, however, is a prime spot next to the gates, open area so u can easily see your gate, booze and amazing customer service!
