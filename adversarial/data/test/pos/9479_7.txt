Are you frigid kidding me?  Get a life!!!  For all you poserrs out there that are going to Pusateri...please make sure that you are buying he stuff that is only exclusive to them...like maybe the so called exquisite dessert selection...or...I don't know what else.  \n\nWalk your sorry asses over to lob laws where the groceries aren't ridiculously priced or if you want...message me and I will come and pick you up in your car...valet park it and carry you on my back around the store to get your groceries.  Just pay me the premium you would have paid to Pusateri :)
