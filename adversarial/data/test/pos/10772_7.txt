Met up with a few friends here yesterday afternoon. The decor is awesome! Artsy, minimal, lots of windows and candles. I like the seating: sectional modern couches around rustic tables. I split the bruschetta sampler with my friend [tomato jam, roasted pepper, prosciutto, and salami]. Delicious! It was unlike any appetizer I've had. Very flavourful and different. The tomato jam was especially impressive. \n\nStaff is good, my water never went empty, and the atmosphere is very cool. Five stars when I try the wine.
