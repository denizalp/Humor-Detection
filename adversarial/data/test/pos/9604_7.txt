Okay, all right, calm down. YES, The Great Brandino is back for a second and writing a review. I couldn't help it, as this place hits a home run. Without even entering the store, I'd decided to give it five stars, and an official \"Brandon's Five Star Rating\". \n\nSo one afternoon when parking for my evening shift at the Flying Fig, I realized I made good time from school and had an hour to kill. I started walking over to the Koffie Cafe, but suddenly noticed a store, ground level, in the old United Bank Building. \"What the hell?\" I thought, having driven by there every day for months and having had no idea something was moving in that quick (Crop Bistro is slated to open in the same building soon). So, I re-jaywalked across Lorain to check it out. \n\nI'd heard of Penzey's, but never ordered anything from them or was in a retail location. The store is on the corner of West 25th and Lorain, again in the awesome ancient United Bank Building, which is soon to be developed into a marketplace\/destination. The store is surprisingly large, with soaring ceilings and a nice display of spices arranged in crates+straw, a cool rustic look. They're organized by types and recipes, and they have a few gift ideas set out conveniently for purchase. I can say without doubt that 50% of my Christmas shopping will be done at Penzeys. Chili set? Check. Gift box with 6 different types of grind-able peppercorns? Check.\n\nThe associates are very friendly and will approach you in a non-annoying fashion. The store is set up so you can have your space, but the second you look perplexed or have need they'll be right with you. \n\nThe best part? OPEN SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. God, I can't tell you all how important it is to develop not just restaurants for nights, but daytime retail spots that are customer friendly and accessible. They'll have an entire customer base from the confused and disillusioned West Side Market people alone.\n\nI've been going through some nasty rough times lately, but when places like this open in my 'hood, it makes me remember why I came back. I friggin love Cleveland.
