No wait time, I was in and out in 10 minutes. Price is reasonable as well, I paid $15 for standard 10 prints card. Staff was very polite and knowledgeable. I also appreciated her gentle touch when she rolled my fingers. Ample parking & super close to UNLV. I'll be back when I'm done with my nursing school.
