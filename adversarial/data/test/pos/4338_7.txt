We booked Ruby Watchco for my birthday dinner this year (29 and feeling fine!).  I had also been sitting on a gift card that I had received from last year's birthday gift!\n\nArrived for our 6pm seating on a Saturday night and first impressions - loved the cozy space and spotted Lynn Crawford working the pass.  We were seated at a table for 2 beside the dreaded plate\/utensil cupboard in afore mentioned reviews but I didn't find it to be too bad.\n\nOur server went over the set menu ($54 per person) and took our drink orders.  We decided to go with the wine pairings for the meal at $39 per person.  On the menu tonight was Ruby's Caesar salad, beef tenderloin, a cheese course and lemon panna cotta dessert.  We also ordered the additional appetizer of beef tartare ($18).\n\nThe first issue of the night was when our main came - our food runner delivered two delicious looking beefy hunks of meat with sides of fingerling potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.  I was prepared to dig in when we noticed that our wine pairing had not arrived.  \n\nWe decided to wait for the wine...and wait, and wait.  Our server finally noticed us about 15 min. after our food arrived and brought over our wine (with very little apology).  By now, the meat and sides were cold.  I'm not that guy to send back an entree so we ate it anyway.  Mood slightly soured but night not completely ruined...yet.\n\nCheese course came next, along with a more timely glass of wine.\n\nAnd then the lemon panna cotta dessert with shortbread cookie which was the perfect end to the meal.\n\nWhen we received our bill, we noticed that the beef tartare was incorrectly billed at $22.  We mentioned this to our server and she was not happy.  We watched her snatch the bill from our table, rush to the back, speak angrily at the kitchen staff and then huff all the way from the register back to our table.  \n\nNo apologies, just attitude from the server leaving me with a feeling that I had been \"Pretty Woman-ed\".  We can afford to eat here, we're just not happy when mistakes are made on our bill.\n\nIf I wanted to be judged and made to feel inferior on my birthday, I would have had dinner at my parents' house, and it would not have cost us $250+.  \n\nFood and wine was overall great but it's hard to enjoy when the service was bitter and inattentive.  I think it was just that one server in particular, not the entire staff because we did have some nice interactions with the food runner and guy who took away our empty dishes.  Just not worth it to me to go back and play server roulette.
