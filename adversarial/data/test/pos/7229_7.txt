Never been to McFadden's but a coworker suggested it for lunch on 4\/3\/2015.  When we arrived, I was surprised to see there were only about a dozen customers scattered throughout the huge dining area.  We sat ourselves, (two of us), at a high top table.  When I sat in the first chair, the bottom seat cushion was unattached and sank into the frame of the chair.  No problem, I'll grab another chair.  The second chair had part of the frame missing and was so wobbly that I couldn't use it either.  Third chair was the charm.  Now I must admit that I watch some of these restaurant programs on TV and perhaps it makes me biased, but I don't think so.  Anyway, we were greeted by a male server who provided us with the simple one page menu.  He also took our drink order.  A minute later, a female server arrived to say that she would be our server and if we would like to order drinks.  We told her that the other server already had that under control. Not bad so far, other than the chair thing.  As I looked around, however, I started to notice how beat up the place looked.  Seemed dirty to me as well.  So, after perusing the menu, I decided I would ask the server if she would choose the fish and chips or the bangers with mashed.  Her response should've given me a green light to get the hell out of there, but so it goes.  Anyway, she said she was concerned about what she eats and hadn't had either, so she couldn't offer a suggestion.  Alrighty then.  I ordered the fish and chips.  By the way, looking at the prices I expected much better quality.  $16 for fish and chips and $20 for the bangers with mashed.  Yikes!  Pricey lunch menu.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  The fish and chips came with three decent sized pieces of fish, fries, coleslaw, and tartar sauce.  The fish was seemingly battered mush.  It had no flavor at all.  The fries were luke warm.  The coleslaw had no seasoning and tasted bland.  The server came by at least three times to see \"if we needed anything\".  I assume she was choosing her words carefully, because if she asked if everything was alright, she would get an earful.  No, everything was not \"alright\". As a matter of fact, most everything was sub-standard and there is no way I will go back to spend that kind of money for something with so little care in preparing.  By the way, with a gratuity, the bill for the two of us was $45.  Two orders of fish and chips, a diet soda, and a glass of water.  Not awesome.  How does a place like this stay in business?  Oh yeah, nightlife partiers who only care about the alcohol selection.  Good luck.
