I went to the zoo with it of town family and my five year old this weekend. I'd been a handful of times and had a good time, so I figured, why not. \n\nFor the price of this zoo, you would think the bathroom stalls would have functional locks. We stopped by three separate bathrooms in the zoo and all of them were either broken up like that or just dirty as he'll. The zoo wasn't even busy that day. \n\nFor the price of this zoo, you would think that a mother wouldn't walk into the bathroom with her child, who needs to pee badly, and have to go through eight stalls before finding one that is clean enough and appears flushed. The aquarium bathroom was a nightmare - so much so that after complaining and seeing that almost an hour later it was STILL covered in garbage and reminiscent of the bathroom in a stadium after the game, I, a PAYING CUSTOMER, went back in, flushed and wiped down five toilets, and cleaned up the floor. \n\nSo I paid to waddle around the zoo with a grumpy kid searching for a bathroom. My out of town guests saw Pittsburgh represented in this disgusting dirty zoo. They can't even keep the place clean for paying customers, how are we to believe they are taking care of the animals? \n\nPittsburgh zoo, GET IT TOGETHER.
