OK, why was the idea of a barcade never done before? \n\ngranted, some of the controls were sticky, the good ones taken, but still lots of fun,and a reasonable time to hang with an elementary school friend with whom our first bonding experiences together were playing video games at the 7-11 on the way home from school.\n\nNow we're old enough to drink.. well, make that old enough to purchase alcohol, neither of us seem to drink much anymore
