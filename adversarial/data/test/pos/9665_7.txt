I was staying on Fremont alone solely for the vegan food and booze. I didn't only bar hop...I appetizer hopped. I had a method to my madness though: it had to be on happy hour or have a yelp check-in free drink. \n\nAnd free drink they did. I got the house margarita with my check in offer and the vegan quesadilla. When I ordered I was surprised to hear a fellow next to me say, \"I'll have what she's having.\" To which the bartender said, \"you know she got the vegan quesadilla right?\" \n\n*cue 30 minute conversation about every Netflix health documentary*\n\nWe both enjoyed our quesadillas and margaritas. As the drinks flowed, the less processed\/fake it tasted. By my second strong margarita, I was convinced. \n\nWould I recommend making your farm-raised cheese loving grandma try the vegan food here? No, it's not that convincing. But to be drunk and able to indulge in vegan Mexican food is one of my highlights of 2017. Fortunately grandma can order off of the regular non-vegan\/vegetarian menu.
