I love Soergel's! It is convenient! The staff is super friendly and very helpful. And the products are outstanding. They have everything a farmer's market should and more. The bakery, yummy! They have pies, cookies, cakes, and brownies that are scrumptious. They have a deli area. They have homemade soups and lunch meats and pre-made salads. They sell cider made there. Their fruits and veggies always look terrific (and taste it too). They have coffee and honey and chips and dips. They have syrups and home goods. And they have a little wine store which is amazing. The newest addition that I finally got to check out, Arsenal Cider. They sell growlers and they offer samples. It is a fabulous addition and I am sorry I had not been to their Lawrenceville location. Their products are delightful and as I was told by the staff helping me, they get their apples from Soergel's. How awesomely fresh is that!:)  They offer a rewards card which is amazing! They do get very busy in the fall...so much so that the traffic backs onto I-79 but on a low key day it really is awesome and I love that we are so close!
