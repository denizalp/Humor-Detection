My experience here was very very poor.  Here is why:\n\nWith Summerlin Dental's office near my own in Tivoli I decided to go in for X-rays and an exam.  The fee was $183.  I walked out with a recommendation for 6 fillings and 1 crown at a cost of $3000.00.  Feeling their diagnosis was so unusual for me, I went elsewhere to another dentist office for a second independent opinion and made sure not to tell the second dentist about the results offered by Summerlin Dental so as not to influence the results.  \n\nThe second dentist, who has over a decade or more in dentistry, amazingly found zero cavities with no need for either fillings nor a crown.  Stunned, at the huge disparity in results I called Summerlin Dental back, cancelled my future appointments and asked for a refund of my $183.  Lacking an office manager I spoke with their billing person Diana who basically said that these x-rays and exams are just a matter of opinion and so they wouldn't refund my money.  \n\nJust as surprising the person I spoke with at Summerlin Dental seemed absolutely un-phased by my telling of what had happened in their office... that results were so very different... and that they had a very unhappy patron of their business.  Who knows? Maybe this type of thing happens at Summerlin Dental all the time?  I don't know, but where I come from we call this type of treatment a scam.\n\nI'd recommend against Summerlin Dental.
