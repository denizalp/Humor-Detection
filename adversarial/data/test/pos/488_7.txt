The perfect place for people who want a nice, quiet place to hang out. I love their choice of interior decor; all the couches are cozy and a great place to make small-talk with friends. This Is the type of place I'd go to if I need to study, but just don't want to do it at my house.\n\nThe drinks are served large, and I believe would definitely be enough for 2 people. I like to play card games with my friends here. And chess!
