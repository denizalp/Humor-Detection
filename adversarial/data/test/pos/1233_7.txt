One of the best sandwich chains in Vegas. I always get the Capastrami. Love cole slaw on my sandwiches, so this one works for me. Have tried the Bobbie and the cheese steak. Both are good, but hands down the winner is the Capastrami. The 20 inch is huge, but what I can't eat I take for lunch the next day. Friendly service with a smile. When you put tips in the tip jar, someone yells \"beer money!\" Although everyone working there is not 21, it is still funny.
