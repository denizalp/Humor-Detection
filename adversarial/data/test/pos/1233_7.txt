I lived here from 2014-2015 & then left because I moved out of town.  I would have stayed if I was not relocating.  The staff & all of my neighbors here were very friendly & the location was great for me.  My apt had a great layout, I felt the quality of building material\/fixtures was good & I never had any issues with appliances.\n\n I only have minor complaints.  First being that I don't find it to be very smart to have a lock on the front door that cannot be unlocked from the outside.  I used my garage to enter\/exit most & found myself locked out at very inconvenient times when the garage door malfunctioned.  It just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nSecondly, the small gym has enough to get a workout in but people have stolen dumbbells.  The exact ones I would use & they were not replaced. It also gets very crowded w\/ just a few people.  2 brand new Life Fitness treadmills have recently been installed.\n\nThirdly, I lived on the first floor so I could have an attached garage.  My upstairs, single neighbor was very noisy at all times of day or night.  I never complained but it literally sounded like she was lifting heavy things & dropping them and pushing heavy furniture across the floor.\n\nOverall, I would still highly recommend this place!
