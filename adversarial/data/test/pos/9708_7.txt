Jasen Cassady, you're gonna give lawyers and the law profession a bad name! Everyone knows a joke that puts down lawyers. People, this guy must be a New School attorney. I met with him on a legal matter today, yes with him, and he is the owner. Jasen is young, energetic, caring, personable, and knows the law. He put my 84 year old aunt at ease and she left his office with a smile, knowing her estate will avoid \" probate \". He rolled my needs and the needs of my aunt into one, one very acceptable bill. After 25 years of law enforcement experience, dealing with the type if attorneys that jokes are made about, this was truly a pleasant experience. Yes, he does spell Jasen with an 'e', not an 'o' !
