Hands down, one of the worst place I have been to... I have never been so disappointed. Service was horrible. Food was cold and mediocre. Was expecting a lot more.\n\nIt started with the waitress.. My bf and I sat outside to eat. I could NOT hear a single thing the waitress said or asked. She spoke so soft and quietly that it was impossible to hear her. I repeatedly asked her to speak up and repeat herself.\n Secondly, we asked her a question about the menu and she seemed like she didn't know how to reply to our question so she just read everything word by word from the menu she took for me, after we ordered she questioned our orders... \"Are you sure you want that?\".. we said yes. She went in to enter in the order and about 5-10 mins later, she comes to our table and tells us that one of our orders was out for the night and we had to switch it out or something else.\nAfter we ordered our food, two tables came in. They got their orders before we did... waited 30 mins for our food. When the food finally came out, they brought it out to the wrong table...... the waiter brought it back in and a min later, brings it out to us.\nHalf way into our food, our waitress came to ask us if we needed anything, I asked for straws and it took her 5 mins to get two straws.... I felt like the waitress just wanted to waste our time and she took her time for everything... \nAt the end of the meal, we asked for our check. She brings it out and stands next to us for a minute and waits for us to get our money... she just stood there while we took our payment out.. I mean normally your supposed to just leave it on the table and let the customers take their time with the check, but not her.\nWhen she returned the check to us, she slid the check on the table and said \"goodnight\" and just walked away... not even looking at us..\n\nFood here is mediocre as stated before. We both got the fried chicken and it was cold and hard. They gave me half of a wing and counted it as 1 piece of chicken. The corn bread is hard and dry... mac and cheese have a very odd after taste.\n\nI can not stop ranting about this place because of the horrible service I received.. I'm sorry, but you're honestly better off eating Bojangles. It is 20Ã— better than this place.
