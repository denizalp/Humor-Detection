My girlfriend loved it, but lemme tell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth. \n\nWorth the read!\n\nOperations review:\nFirst, the female chef\/cook came out of the back several times talking on her iPhone and touching her personal phone. (Any fellow biology major, health food professional, or parent knows precisely how dirty that is) her hands went straight from her phone to wrapping and making some type of egg roll. Never washing her hands. This for me was a red flag. \n\nThe kitchen is shielded only by glass, & so I purposely made eye contact with her as she put her phone down on the counter aka the food prep line. She just looked down, but continued to use her iPhone in the kitchen throughout the service. \n\nThe waiter was a young boy that seemed inexperienced as a waiter. Very sweet young man, but clearly not a server. Hence, the service was slow, had to flag him down every time, water was left empty, had to ask for everything including to-go box and check. I should mention that he was on his own as far as front of house. He was the host, waiter, and busser. Unfair to him as an employee and myself as a patron. We sat ourselves and grabbed our own menus. \n\nUnfortunately, the cute little glass pitchers they serve tea in and tiny little Asian inspired decor on the table aren't enough to win me over after service like that and the food wasn't great either...\n\nOH! ALSO, IT TOOK FOREVER FOR FOOD TO COME OUT AND PLATES COME OUT AT TOTALLY SEPARATE TIMES. \nWhat we ordered:\nBeef & onion Pancakes \nChicken & steak skewers\nChicken chow mein\nOrange chicken with white rice \n\nBill total: $36 and change \n\nFood review: \nPancakes were a bit soggy. I saw a video review on Yelp draining them, but I figured it was because it was beef and onions and they're bound to cause liquid. Nope. The plate was totally wet under them. Fine, okay. However, the flavor was in consistent. We had two cakes cut in halves. My gf ate one half and was going on and on, but I was having a hard time getting it down. Something terribly strong and overpowering everything else was in mine. Then we noticed she grabbed hers from opposite end. She tasted mine and couldn't eat it either. Weird. \n\nChicken and steak skewers were cooked fine, and others may enjoy them but the seasoning was over the top for me. You could visibly see that they were covered in seasoning. \n\nChicken chow mein was delicious my gf said. It looked good. \n\nOrange chicken was crispy, but ultimately tasted like they buy the same bottle of \"Orange chicken glaze\" that I do at the supermarket when I make it at home. That was disappointing. \n\nService 3\/10\nFood 5\/10\nPrice point 9\/10\nCleanliness 3\/10\n\nLikely to return? Probably not.
