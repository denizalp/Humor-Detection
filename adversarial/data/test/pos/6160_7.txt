Tim English is amazing.\n\nA succesful lawyer turned chocolatier, this store is the mixture of creativity and an entrepeneurial spirit.\n\nFirst off, the peanut butter bacon chocolate is a must. Unexpectedly amazing chewing into bacon like it were a raisin. \n\nSecond off, i highly recommend the initimate truffle making course Tim can arrange for you and your friends. It makes for a very fun night. \n\nThere's passion, there's fun ingredients, there's pure whimsy in the stuff he makes.
