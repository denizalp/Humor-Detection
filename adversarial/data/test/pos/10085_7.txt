My daughter and I continue our tradition of picking a new ice cream\/frozen concoction establishment every Monday. Today's adventure brought us all the way down to Tempe, to the Zoyo on the corner of Guadalupe and McClintock.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with this establishment, it is a self-serve frozen yogurt place. Basically, you \"Fill It\", \"Top It\", \"Weigh It\" and \"Enjoy It\" http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/J7p54MOpJA-Rkg4z-bPxlA?select=TfByGhc2t6Xc-CMAmchjog#wtp4k2-qH1dBrGDr2351Pg.\n\nLet's start with step one: \"Fill It\"\n\nFirst of all, you have two choices in cup size...small large, and LARGE large! You take your cup choice to the dispenser that contains your flavor of the day. If memory serves me correctly, there were at least 10 different (cleverly named) flavors on tap, including a seasonal Pumpkin flavor. Today, Mackenzie wanted the \"Cake Batter, Batter...Swing\" http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/J7p54MOpJA-Rkg4z-bPxlA?select=TfByGhc2t6Xc-CMAmchjog#zBZKYrzVXHUprV6ifty3hw. \n\nNow, bear in mind...these cup sizes are ridiculous. We barely filled our \"smaller large\" half way. That amount was perfect for us. \n\nNext up: \"Top It\"\n\nThere are an INCREDIBLE amount of different toppings from which to choose! There are two connected toppings tables that each contain 28 separate choices http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/J7p54MOpJA-Rkg4z-bPxlA?select=TfByGhc2t6Xc-CMAmchjog#PVJNb8zvMG7imZ217BhWKQ. If you're math savvy, that's 56 different toppings! \n\nNow, Mackenzie tends to keep it simple. After perusing the various flavors, and pausing on a few (Fruity Pebbles, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Gummy Bears, Chocolate Waffle Cone, Sprinkles, Mini M&Ms...I think you get the idea), my daughter opted for a simple, yet elegant, Chocolate Waffle Cone topping.\n\nStep three\/Step four: \"Weigh It\" \"Enjoy It\"\n\nAll that's left to do is pay for your delicious choice. The yogurt isn't very expensive at all. Our half-filled small large frozen yogurt was under $4.00. Plenty of yogurt, plenty of quality sit-down time. What more can you ask for at that price?\n\nNow, we opted to sit inside. The deco was 50's style retro, and very inviting http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/J7p54MOpJA-Rkg4z-bPxlA?select=TfByGhc2t6Xc-CMAmchjog#dvwrCQVaFgDnagYeGyyhfg. \n\nBut, if we had time, I think we would have opted for the outdoor patio area http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/J7p54MOpJA-Rkg4z-bPxlA?select=TfByGhc2t6Xc-CMAmchjog#HHYiqFjBO24XBpZhGIGtBg. This section, during the cooler months or at night, would be prime real estate! \n\nThus concludes this week's frozen concoction adventure!
