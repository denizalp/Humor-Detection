The reason I give this place 2 stars is because of price and average food. We had a party of 6 and we ordered a large lasagna, a small shrimp florentine, small basket of garlic bread, a beer, and 3 soft drinks. My bill came out to be 100 bucks. The lasagna wasn't great. It lacked meat and it was overly salty. I wasn't impressed at all. And a large isn't so large. You would think that the large would be fairly a large portion when it says it feeds 4 or more people. Trust me, when you have a group of men, it will probably feeds 2-3 people. The lasagna was $40 dollars for a cheese lasagna with no meat. It says meat sauce, but it was just salty cheesy tomato sauce with not a single meat piece. Skip the lasagna, not worth it. The shrimp florentine was good and the garlic bread was delicious. Everything here is al a carte so the bread was $10! And the shrimp florentine was $30 for a small size. What kind of irks me here was that they charge for refills too. So when everyone got refills on their root beer and diet coke they charge $1.75 or something for each refill. So, it was 20 bucks roughly for 3 sodas and a Heineken. Wtf. Let me tell you guys, in Vegas there is not a single establishment that charges for refills on drinks. I feel like this place is a money eater and sends out overly salty food. When the waiter came to ask, would you like a refill on your drink, my party made the assumption that refills were free. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for my tap water and the cups and utensils I used. Jeez. My head was hurting from the massive intake on salt after that. I don't mind dropping a 100 bucks for food, if it was good. A bit disappointed with them. Won't ever be back, way too many great Italian places in Vegas to spend that much on mediocre food.
