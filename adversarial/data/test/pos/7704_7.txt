I'll always come here when in town but it's only for the guacamole. It's ridiculously good!\n\nThat said, the service is always terrible. Forgetful sometimes, but irritated and rude always. I come to Phoenix 3 or 4 times a year and always stay at the Clarendon, so I've eaten here probably 15 times since they opened. Either the servers are unhappy or they don't like me in general. \n\nNot for nothing but I know me, and I'm pretty easy to like, so I'm guessing it's something else. \n\nThe cocktails are fine, prices are great, but someone get the staff some Xanax or something.
