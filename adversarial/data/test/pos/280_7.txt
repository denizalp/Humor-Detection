Let's face it folks--this ain't McCormick & Schmick.  It's a dive, it's cheap, and the fish here is oh so good, providing you lower your expectations a little.  Meaning that you're not gonna get five-star cuisine but you'll get good basic chow here.  I went for the baked scrod sandwich and a side of hot sausage soup.  Trust me, if you're a soup lover like me, you'll want to come here whenever that's the soup of the day.\n\nGuess I'll be hitting the gym tonight after work.
