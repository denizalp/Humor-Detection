First of all the 80 year old lady, that THROWS herself on people in there hugging them and kissing them HAS GOT TO GO.  2nd of all WHAT a DUMP, it looks like they spent under 1,000.00 dollars to put that place together. \nWhen it comes to ordering the food WATCH OUT for HIDDEN FEES (cashier will not give you a reciept to show you), the so called philly cheesesteak was the WORST I ever had, it was DRY and tasted like you were chewing on a TIRE.  If you want a better sandwich go to the FROZEN FOOD ISLE in the grocery store.\nTHE SERVICE was SLOW and UNORGANIZED (I think it was everybodys 1st day on the job).    WILL NOT BE BACK.
