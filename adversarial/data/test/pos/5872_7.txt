Brilliant show!! You go in with certain expectations and you think you know what's going to happen but they keep surprising you!!  I definitely want to watch it again if I can (to see if I can catch what I missed the first time).\n\nBonus: Penn and Teller both hang out after the show to meet the audience and sign autographs. I was thrilled to meet Penn in person! (Loved him on Celebrity Apprentice!) He's a giant though...apparently 6'6...crazy tall!!
