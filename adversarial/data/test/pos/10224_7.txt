From the front of this shopping center, it looks like your normal outdoor mall.  In back of whole foods, you'll find a maze of streets, with street meter parking lined with brand named storefronts.  I did not explore anything besides whole foods and Sephora because my wife forgot some make up at home.  But the entire layout of this place is kinda neat.
