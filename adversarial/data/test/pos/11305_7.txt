My friends and I had a lot of energy after getting out of Tryst and decided to dance until the wee hours of the morning at Drai's. \n\nWhen we got there, a line was already wrapping around the small entrance. Many people were more than happy to pay the cover charge ($20 for ladies; $30 for gents). Make sure to find someone who can get you on the list to avoid the cover charge ;)! Once we got in I felt like I was in a high school basement party. I'm not into house so I was trying to find some way to enjoy the music being played.\n\nFortunately, we discovered a closed off hip-hop room on the other side. For guys, they had to get bottle service to be let in (at least that's how it was the night we went) and ladies are let in with no string attached (what a surprise...not). Some of the guys we made friends with were forced to leave since they tried to sneak in...which was kind of a bummer. \n \nMy first impression of the \"hip-hop room\"....hmph....let's just say I was in a really bad rap video. \n\nWould I come back? My drunk alter ego says yes. My sober, rational self says probably not.
