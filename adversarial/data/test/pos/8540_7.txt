I came here for nightswim with my friends.  We were easily able to get on the guestlist so my entire group got in for free. \n\nOpen bar on Thursdays for girls. ( cran vodka, vodka pineapple, etc) \n\nThey didn't have a famous DJ the night I went, so it wasn't super crowded, which was nice because when they do have famous DJs it gets so packed you can barely walk around.  There was still a good amount of people here for a Thursday night.  \n\nSprinkles Ice Cream was here giving out free strawberry shortcake ice cream and strawberry gelato! So delish, especially since it was 110 degrees at 1 am. wtf. The DJ played alot of top 40s rap\/ hip hop which I enjoyed because sometimes you get sick of EDM. \n\nYou can dress alot more casually here which is really nice, because I don't feel like dressing up all the time.  Alot of people just show up in crop tops and shorts. \nFind a safe place to hide your stuff, my friend lost his phone, and my other gf got here sandals stolen. \n\nHave fun !
