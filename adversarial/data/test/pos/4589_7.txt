I just moved here about 1 month ago. I was very nervous about going to a new hairdresser but I referred to this salon and Seren (the stylist). She is absolutely amazing. She does an amazing highlighting job. She was so nice, she even sent me a thank you card with a 15% discount. I will be going back in the next month or so to get my hair done again. I am so glad that I found a great salon... and a great stylist the first time around!
