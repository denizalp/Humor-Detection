I got a great deal on a Lorex video security system at Costco, but it's been nothing but headaches and hassles ever since. \n\nThe set itself looked to be of good quality, and truth be told the cameras have held up well. However the DVR and their FLIR cloud, the nerve center of the system, has been an unmitigated nightmare. \n\nThe main problem is that you're basically required to connect to your cams via the FLIR cloud. It's quite unlike the old (but more reliable) IP cams which I used in the past with great success. With those, you just put the IP address and port into a viewing app, open the port on your router, and you're good to go. With Lorex, you're at the mercy of their cloud to view anything. \n\nAnyway, after a professional installation, we started it up, but the system would not connect to the FLIR cloud no matter what we did. Our internet here is verizon Fios which is ridiculously fast for every other application, but with the Lorex DVR and the FLIR cloud it was always slow and unresponsive. So aggravating I can't even begin to tell you. \n\nWe contacted them about it via their support site, but we ultimately had to find solutions ourselves on video security forums when they gave us useless canned answer after useless canned answer. With the help of random Lorex owners online, we tweaked the setup a bit and finally got it to connect, but the feed was often  unreliable, slow and choppy. Video quality was also far what the 1080p cams were showing locally. \n\nThe worst part of the entire system was the stupid, unstable Lorex FLIR cloud app. Aside from feeds timing out or not loading up at all, the mobile playback feature to view stored footage constantly failed.  Normally you should be able to pull up any clip for the past 24 hours from any of the cameras. However, it never worked for us, not even a single time. We'd always have to go to the DVR itself just to playback footage. Hassle and a half. \n\nIf Lorex had decent customer service then their lackluster products probably wouldn't be be so unmanageable and annoying. But they don't. They have horrendous customer service. \n\nIf you email them, 50% of the time you get no reply, and the other 50% of the time you have to wait 3 to 4 days for replies. And the replies you get completely suck. Like...did you check to see if the router is working? Maybe you can unplug your router and then plug it back in! No MF, my internet and router are awesome. Everything else I own that connects to the internet is awesome. It's your product that sucks.\n\nActually, Lorex's tech support never successfully solved any issue I had. As I mentioned previously, most of the answers came from random forums where other Lorex users were complaining to each other about terrible products and brainstorming solutions. \n\nOn top of all this, my DVR had a hard drive failure just a few days after the 1 year warranty expired. \n\nIn a nutshell, I despise Lorex and would advise people to steer clear of their products no matter how good a deal it is.
