This review is for Le Village's breakfast buffet only. I have been told by many people how great this breakfast buffet is; but personally, I don't see it nor do I understand why anyone would think that it's any good. Maybe since I only tried one breakfast in Vegas and this was probably the best one compared to others? Seriously though, the only thing that I enjoyed here were the grapefruits and strawberries. Everything else was just simple breakfast food like bagels, oatmeal, bacon, ham, etc. and it tasted average, if not, pretty bad.  \n\nHowever, the setting, design, and decors at this buffet was just very nice. It was basically like you were in a French village underneath a blue beautiful sky. Also, it was cool that there were different food stations. There was a station where you can make fresh crepes and another where omelettes were freshly made just how you like it.\n\nHere's what went wrong for me: \n\nThere were so many different variety of scrambled eggs at one of the stations. Everything had eggs and eventually, it was just quite overwhelming. Another thing was the fruits. Some of the fruits tasted weird and did not taste fresh at all. The grapes tasted soft and weird while the honeydew and cantaloupe were not sweet at all. Then the drinks, I tried the coffee, which tasted horrible, the grapefruit and orange juice, which both tasted horribly. \n\nThe service here was horrible!! Besides from our waitress (who was very nice and lovely), everyone else was so rude! So we ordered a crepe and wanted a regular Nutella crepe with nothing inside... We tried to tell the chef that, but he didn't hear or wasn't listening and asked what number. So we thought we had to pick a number and said \"one.\" Then after, we can just leave stuff out. I mean. It's not like I knew and it's not like he even started with the crepe. So when we asked politely if he can you exclude the bananas and such since we just wanted Nutella. He said with so much attitude, \"Don't say one then!\" Well excuse me rude guy! We did say what we wanted but you asked us for a number! \n\nAt the omelette station, the guy before us ordered two eggs prepared sunny side up. The cook broke both of them and asked the guy it. I just thought that was funny. Other places will throw it away and make new ones. Anyways, the point is, service here isn't good. If they didn't say anything rude, they just looked as though they were having the worst morning of their lives or they just hated working there. \n\nPersonally, if you don't have a buffet of buffet pass, I wouldn't try this place and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. But that's just me.
