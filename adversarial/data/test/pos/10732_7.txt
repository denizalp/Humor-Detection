Huge improvement on beer prices, menu choices and quality of food as Sweet Home took over this boring Rosati's location. Nearly all domestic beers are 4 bucks and there are even cans of old school beer for less. The menu is gigantic now and contains pizza, sandwiches, burgers and an entire BBQ section. It did take awhile to decide, but went with the $14 chicken parmesan dinner which was served with pasta and bread (although my bread was not included in the to-go order). The chicken was a large fork tender piece and was great, but the pasta sauce was too chunky as a marinara would have worked better with the spaghetti. For $2,50, I added a side of very good piece of cornbread from the BBQ side of things. Nothing else has changed inside it appears, but this place is way better than the previous tenant.
