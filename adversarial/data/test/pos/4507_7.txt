YUL does do its job in that it gets you from Point A to Point B but that is about it.  If you're stuck here for a long layover and need to eat there isn't much in terms of restaurants and shops.  Also while the layout is simple and easy to understand the interior design is nothing special.  I know it's an airport but when you look at those like YVR (my favourite one in Canada) which has excellent interior design it leaves me underwhelmed. \n\nThese days there are quite a bit of renovations going on at the airport so things can get a little confusing.  On a recent flight back from YYZ we were actually rerouted through the international departures section which was odd.  I must admit that I do hope the renovations make this airport a little better.  Wi-fi is free here and is also unlimited which seems to be the norm here in Canada but internationally it isn't always the case.\n\nThe line ups for customs and security are generally pretty good with the occasional exception.  I've had a two hour wait at customs and other times I've breezed right through.  Security usually goes fast though with the exception of one recent trip where it seemed like all the screening agents decided to take their lunch break at the same time leaving very few checkpoints open.  Consequently a massive line-up formed and I had to run to my gate.  \n\nBe warned that if you're going to drive here give yourself a little extra time as with construction around the airport getting here can be a major pain.  It seems like every time I go here to pick up someone or take a flight that the access changes due to construction.  If you can try and take the 747 express bus which is your best option to get from the airport to the city center.  Taxis are expensive here so avoid those too if you can.
