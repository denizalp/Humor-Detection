Get yo ass here for a pizza. It's the only thing I've eaten here but it is like eating the food that the gods refer to as 'The food of the gods'.\n\nThey have a Napoli style oven with ingredients flown in from the same so yes it is a traditional Naples pizza. The only downside to the restaurant is that the wine is fairly expensive (but delish). \n\nPLUS - If you notice the below review from Precilla C - Mel C has also eaten here. If its good enough for Scary Spice it's good enough for me.
