The people at Frost may not tell you, but Angels make the gelato. What you are actually eating is Heaven. If you listen closely once you have finished eating there is a holy choir singing. It's true. I heard it once myself. \n\nWorth the hype, the price and the wait. Expect to wait 20-30 minutes in the late afternoon. The staff try their best to give quality service with such long lines. Just be patient and you won't be let down.
