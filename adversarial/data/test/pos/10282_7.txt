CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE WAS THE WORST PEOPLE IVE EVER TALKED TO IN MY LIFE.... Worst bank I've ever had to deal with... I called to get business account number, simple task, after numerous attempts of having to hang up and call back, they finally gave me a number, the WRONG number on purpose after we exchanged words.... That's got to be illegal and she needs to be fired. Then she even has the nerve to freeze my account while I'm out of town and can't go into a branch when they're clearly in the wrong.. Grow up and get better employees. I'm making sure everyone knows how I feel about this credit union. I definitely would not ever bank here for anyone in the future.
