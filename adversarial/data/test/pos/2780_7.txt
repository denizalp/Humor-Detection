I've come here a number of times.  The fact that they're open on Sunday is incredible if you have an emergency.\n\nThe guys who run the shop will talk you through everything.  I've always felt I'm making an informed decision, without pressure.\n\nAs someone whose knowledge of cars is far less than it should be, this is the place I trust when I need to have something done.\n\nEven though it's a bit farther for me to drive out to, the peace of mind and quality work more than makes up for it!
