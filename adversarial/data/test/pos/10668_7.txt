This is a decent spot to grab a bite when you're traveling in the area.  The manager I think was full of life and filled us in on the Giant Rubber Duck that was in Pittsburgh while we were there!   The wait staff seemed friendly and quick - though I was surprised by their attire.  I would expect a little more put-together appearance for such an establishment.\n\nI had a salad, and my husband had a burger.  They were ok.  Nothing stellar or out of the ordinary.  It was sufficient.  Though I do enjoy their fries.  And their seasoning.  Love that there is extra on the table.
