Enchanted Island is.....enchanting.  We brought an energetic 6 year old to the park, it was his first experience with an amusement park, and it was perfect for him.  He had no expectations, and absolutely loved every ride.  The parachute ride and the Dragon Roller Coaster absolutely took priority though.  Since it was on a Thursday, and around noon, we brought a picnic lunch and ate in the park across the street.  Don't make the mistake of throwing crumbs onto the lawn, or you'll be re-enacting a terror scene from Hitchcock movie.  Those pigeons were SCARY!  \nThe train ride was great, it cooled us off too, and really lasted a long time.  The park\/ride attendants were very kind and patient.  We did appreciate the time they spent making sure each child was secured in the ride.  When we left the park, the 6 year old enthusiastically proclaimed it \"THE BEST DAY EVER!!!
