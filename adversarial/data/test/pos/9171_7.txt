This is a Must See in Vegas, especially if you're in between the ages of 30 and 55.  The music will take you down memory lane, for sure. \n\nI really wanted to see this show, had heard great things about it.  I have seen the movie, and I will say that without a doubt, the live musical KILLS the movie.  \n\nThe performances were on point, the show was hilarious and the actors were all great.  Having seen the movie in the past, I was able to follow the transition of Drew from being Wolfgang to Joshey ZZZ a little better, since they really didn't' spend a ton of time developing this part of the story, like they did in the movie.  I am not sure I would have understood that if I hadn't known what that was all about....they never really made it clear that the one guy was his Agent.  Same guy that played the Mayor earlier in the show.  So that part was confusing if you didn't know the story a bit already.\n\nThe cast and sets and costumes were fantastic, I highly recommend this show.  I checked in on Yelp and got $30 off ticket prices...of course we bought our tickets online in advance.  However, I will see this again if I get the chance, so I will save those check-in coupons.  If you can go by the ticket office ahead of time and check in on Yelp, get the coupons, and then compare those prices at the box office with coupon, to online offers....might save a bit.  We paid $69\/ticket before taxes and fees, our seats were in Section 3, Row M, seats 60 and 61 which were on the aisle, and the seats were awesome.  Small venue, so all the seats are pretty decent.
