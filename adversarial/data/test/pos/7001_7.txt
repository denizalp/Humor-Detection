I had the unfortunate melding of a summer of weight gain and an unexpected death in the family (cancer just sucks).  Thankfully, between the Southpark and University locations they were able to assist within my time constraints,  tailoring included (God did not build me as an off-the-rack kinda guy, apparently).\n\nSo . . . in a jiffy I'm now spiffy, shiny, and new.  Give 'em a whirl (but don't wait like I did).\n\nPS:  Thanks for helping me out in a bind!
