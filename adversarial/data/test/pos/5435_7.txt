Pretty good stuff. I read that they are originally located in Australia? Interesting. It was my first time at Downtown Summerlin and my friend suggested we grab gelato at this place after some positive word of mouth and good reviews.\n\nWe went on a Wednesday night and this place was quite busy. You can sample as many flavors as you want but personally, I start to feel like I'm bothering them after 3 samples. I tried the apple pie (wayyyy toooo sweet for me!!), yogurt berry (it was good), and coconut and lychee. In the end, that's what I decided on since I'm a big fan of coconut. They got a few flavors with coconut in them too.\n\nI believe it was $2.50 for one scoop....a pretty good sized scoop too. It was enough to satisfy any sweet cravings without making you feel fat and \"yucky\" afterwards. I'm looking forward to trying other flavors next time I'm around.
