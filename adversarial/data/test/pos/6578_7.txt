This is my go-to gas station for gas, snacks, and late night drunk food! \n\nNot gonna lie, I mostly go to see Anita (featured in my attached photos!!). She is a freaking star! Posing for selfies like she struts the red carpet! This woman works the late night shift so that she can spend time with her grandson during the day. How freaking sweet is that?! I wish she was my grandma. Anyway she puts up with me and my drunk friends on the occasional night out and is always so sweet. \n\nOh and their food options are fantastic and taste so good. They also have BOMB donuts.
