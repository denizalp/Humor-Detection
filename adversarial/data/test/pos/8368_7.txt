I had been walking non-stop all day and missed both breakfast and lunch, so I said to myself what many inebriated or otherwise bothered bodies have said before me and was just like \"yo, f**k this, I'm getting McDick's.\"\n\nThis is my neighbourhood McDonald's, and I've been more times than I care to remember. Not to say I have particularly much against McDonald's, somewhat the contrary even, but one can't pretend it's not fast food- even the side salads are premade covered in cheese, just incase you were trying to get away with being healthy. \nI was considering trying this new 'CBO' sandwich they are advertising for everywhere, but was leaning away from it, when the entire board of menu-displaying television screens rudely faded into one giant CBO ad. I was at the front of the line and couldn't see the rest of the menu so I said \"yo, f**k it I'll get that CBO.\" And a couple double hamburgers of course- no fast food place serves a combo that comes close to satisfying my hunger alone. \nThe CBO was CB-Okay. I would've rather had another 2 or three double hamburgers for the same price (THE VALUE MENU CANNOT BE BEATEN...  WHY DOES ANYONE ORDER ANYTHING BUT DOUBLE HAMBURGERS???) I literally have nothing else to say about it. Look at the picture (morph it mentally as you've learned the difference between pictured and actual menu items at every fastfood restaurant) and imagine that image with no surprises in your mouth- that's the CBO.\n\nWhat completed my okay meal was the okay setting-  which I suppose is the boring real content of this otherwise charmingly vacant Yelp review- the employees are standard fastfood employees, only base imagination skills necessary for you; everything else about this place is also standard McDonald's, SAVE for the large walls of windows letting in a refreshing roomful of the surrounding parks- one to the south and one to the west; there is only one stall and urinal in the men's washroom, which is unfortunate for a busy fast food restaurant. \n\nI left McDonald's the same way I always do: still hungry, and feeling a little greasy, but some part of me somewhere- maybe a masochistic little devil in me-oddly satisfied.
