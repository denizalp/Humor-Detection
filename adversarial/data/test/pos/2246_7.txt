Went to this place today thinking it was a regular \"urgent care\" center like MedExpress. A man in a polo shirt walked into the exam room and said, \"I need a urine sample.\" I asked who he was and he said, \"I'm Dr. ______. This is my clinic.\" No lab coat, no name tag, no introduction, no nothing. \n\nHe said he needed to do blood work and x-Rays to treat for an upset stomach. I felt uneasy and left. \n\nChecking their website when I got home I discovered that this man was a nurse practitioner, not a doctor. I called the clinic to make sure this was indeed the same person. I asked who treated me and was told, \"Oh, that was Dr. _____.\" I asked if he is a doctor and she replied, \"No. He's a nurse but he goes by Dr. ______.\"\n\nIsn't it illegal to misrepresent like that? This place seems shady.
