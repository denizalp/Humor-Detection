We've been members of Calvary for 8 years and we love it. If you want good solid Bible teaching and great fellowship, this is the church for you. Don't let the size of Calvary put you off--it's big, but it feels small. You'll make some good friends if you attend the same service regularly. Pastor Mark is a man of God and he teaches through the Bible verse by verse. The worship is a great mix of contemporary and traditional Christian songs that you will love. Seriously, come to Calvary this weekend. You will love it here.
