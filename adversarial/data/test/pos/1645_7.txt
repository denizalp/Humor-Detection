Georges Brasserie is now officially my favorite brunch place in all of Charlotte!\n\nThe layout for Sunday Brunch will blow your mind. You'll find many of your favorites that you'll keep coming back for more (and more)! The shrimp are like ponies you can ride into the sunset!\n\nReally impressive job of keeping up with the seasons - this past visit there was a wonderful Beet Tartare and Spring Vegetable Mix! Bravo Chef!\n\nDon't even get me started on the dessert trays! Pure decadence!\n\nAmazing first class service! Crisp white linens! Coffee, Mimosas and fresh Beignets to die for!!\n\nThe best of the best is the Crepe Suzette cooked to order! If I was trapped on a desert island, I would just want the island to be one big Crepe Suzette!
