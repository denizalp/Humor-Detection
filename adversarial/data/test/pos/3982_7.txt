The large rooftop patio of this boathouse bar lured me in. Once inside, was a bit disappointed. Very large, but quite trashy and dirty looking. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't filthy or anything, its just more casual and dive-y than what I was expecting. still a decent place to grab a few drinks. I haven't tried the food, but they have a good money saving Yelp deal. Ahoy mateys!
