The food was okay but the restaurant stinks. Literally, it smells. Upon entering, the bathrooms are immediately to the left of the entrance and they stink up the whole front section of the restaurant. During my wait to be seated, the strong smell of cleaning chemicals and human waste almost ruined my appetite. Luckily, my husband and I were seated in the back so this wasn't much of a problem during our meal. \n\nOur waitress was very polite and attentive. However, I couldn't help but notice that there wasn't much of a concern for cleanliness in any of the employees. When our waitress brought out our napkins, there were crumbs all in the napkins. Instead of replacing them, she said, \"that's from the biscuits.\" Ok, but for all I know, that could be from someone else's old biscuit basket. Another employee brought out our plates and there were items hanging off the plates, touching the trays. This was served to us without any hesitation. Other unsanitary incidents occurred that I won't go into detail. I understand that this is a little nit-picky, but my husband ended up getting sick after this dinner and we can't help but wonder the reason why. \n\nFor food, he ordered coconut shrimp and I ordered crab legs. It all tasted alright, but you can't really go wrong with steaming crab legs and refrying frozen coconut shrimp. \n\nI've had better experiences at other Red Lobsters so I'm not totally against this seafood chain. This location, however, I am not a fan.
