Worst place to have a party, I had my wedding there. They didn't let all my guest in, they charged $500 for decorations, wedding favors  & flowers, they didn't put any flowers at ALL, the color wasn't the one we asked for, the guest couldn't take the wedding favors, they hardly had any decorations that looked as if they took 2 seconds to decorate it. I asked the man in charge i think he's Jamaican to let my guest in , & he told me to calm down or he was going to cancel my party. Really?!  Oh and they kept most of the beer that wasn't given away. Worst people worst place ever!!!!!
