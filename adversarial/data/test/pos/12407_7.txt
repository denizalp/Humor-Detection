bought a few stogies here to smoke over a bourbon at the bar.  i don't know much about cigars and what's a reasonable price to pay for most major brands, but i'm sure they were on the pricey side since this is vegas.  \n\nthe staff are really nice, it's these two asian chicks who are pretty friendly.  sonia, if you are reading this, i still think you need to leave your bf for someone who doesn't wear blue striped tank tops.  ;)
