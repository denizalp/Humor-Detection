After the panels closed yesterday at the convention I decided to take some \"me\" time. The shopping in the Bellagio is very extensive and upscale so this is where I ended up. The scarves that Herm√®s sells are a weakness for me wanting to play tourist time to shop. The sheer elegance and quality of there scarves is off the charts. This location in the Bellagio is a larger store than most on the strip. Upon entering the staff or security (nowadays everywhere in high end Vegas shops) looks one over. Once you get past all the unpleasantness of I'm not going to hurt anyone we can start to shop. I was greeted was the usually pleasantries and asked where the scarves were.\n\nThe selection of merchandise in the store is so massive. The quality of each square one can feel with the delicate softness in your hands. As I looked through all the beautiful designs and artwork on the scarves all so colorful. I am seeking a scarf that is one color, but would settle for one in two colors too. I did not find what I was looking for. With the help of the store staff I was not able to either. \n\nThe store has the softest carpet, since when you walk through the store your feet bounce a little. So many new collections of the Spring and Summer were on display. The displays of the new handbags were delivered in a presentation that could be out of real life. Such as a beach type handbag for a beach scene. I find this very appealing and displays their products in a way that you can use your handbag and should.
