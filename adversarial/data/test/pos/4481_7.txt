My 1st time here.  Came to try the halo halo desert.  It reminds me of iced  Vietnamese desert.  I recently dined at Tokyo Lobby with no Asian clients.  However I was pleasantly happy to see all the Asians here at Halo Halo!  It's incredible here with the nightlife.  Filipinos running DEEP, in a great way!! I feel like I'm on foreign land and I'm loving it!!  Karaoke!!!! Fun and friendly atmosphere.  You must check it out.   :)
