I am beyond disappointed. I'm literally crushed by the experience I've just had with Local Donut.  7 months ago I wrote a glowing review about how amazing their donuts are and that I couldn't wait to use them for our wedding. After writing that review, I had gone into the shop and asked them about placing our order for our wedding. Their comment then was \"oh, don't worry about it. Just call us 2 weeks prior to the wedding date to place your order and it will be great!\"\n\nFast forward to two weeks before our wedding, and here I am writing this review. I called this morning to place our order as instructed, and they told me that they couldn't take my order because they already had another order for a different wedding on the same day. I am absolutely devastated because this is literally what we've been planning as our entire dessert for our whole wedding since over a year ago. If I had known that they wouldn't be able to do multiple large orders at a time, I would have placed my order literally months ago, but instead they said \"well, since we've been featured in Buzzfeed we've gotten really busy, so now we tell everyone to place orders as soon as possible.\" Really helpful at this point, especially because the reason they were featured in the first place was because of their Yelp reviews - I was one of the first people to write them a 5 star review, and this was anything BUT a five star experience.\n\nI don't even know what we're going to do for our wedding now. It's too late to order a larger cake or place large orders elsewhere. I'm so incredibly disappointed with Local Donut.
