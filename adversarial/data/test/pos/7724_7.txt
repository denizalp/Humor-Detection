So I could start by raving about the small dishes I started my meal with such as the Toban Yaki with a side of coconut rice.. Or the baked crab hand rolls made with baked snow crab and this spicy aioli sauce that is to die for.  These two dishes sparked my tastebuds and I wasn't sure how they would top them.  Rok shrimp tempura was perfect and had a nice mild spice to it. Sushi rolls like the El Chapo, Chi Chi Roll (porkbelly sushi roll), High Steaks roll (formally known as the fancy wagyu roll), and 49th State roll would be my top choice and watching the Godzilla platter come out to another table makes me want to go back right now just to have all to myself. We also had some of the steak and chicken dishes, however my end all and the main reason this will be one of my weekly spots is the HONEY TOAST!!!! This was by far the best I've ever had!! Being a fatkid eating honey toast from different countries and many states I can truly say this above any other will blow your mind.  #fatkidforlife
