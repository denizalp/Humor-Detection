Morning Ritual...get fair trade, smoke cig, wait for car pool. \n\ni have been holding off reviewing fair trade for a very long time...where once i felt it was pretentious and kinda uppity with it's social politics...i have since embraced this jewel and really love the people who work here. every morning i get greeted and for the most part they know what i want and it simplifies everything.\n\nfirst i don't get all picky with what i get, it's a large drip every morning. i usually steer for Medium Roast..but for the most part i like what i get..dark or medium..so i stopped specifying. it is just good so why complicate things with being picky.\n\nFair Trade also gives out discounts for RS residents, Gov. employees, students, and seniors. as a resident of the apartment \"complex\" fair trade is in. i get my resident discount..i think it's 10%. which is nice because it brings the cost down below 2 bucks for a large coffee..i then feel more justified with the 1 dollar tip i usually leave. \n\n1 star for good coffee \n1 star for great employees \n1 star for location \n1 star for prices \n1 star for convenience\n\nahhh i feel better now.
