Ew, this place was so ghetto.\nThe decor was so dark & dirty looking, did not like it at all. \nIt looked more like a hooka lounge than an actual night club.\nThe music was not cracking & the crowd too. Bleh.\nWe stayed here for a good 30 mins & headed over to LAX.\nOver it, never going back in here EVER.
