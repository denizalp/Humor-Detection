Since I've been named dropped twice other reviews - I figure it's about time I chime in with my review.  To be honest, I didn't really want to review Bar Hop because I really don't want to shine a light into my shadow.  The less people that know about this place means less crowding and no waiting for seats.  Also, it was 'that cool place that Johnson took me to' but alas, it's hard for a joint this good to remain secret for long.\n\nI stumbled past this dark and anonymous storefront on the loud and obnoxious King West - even for a newcomer to town, I knew King West is not a place you expect good beer (Bier Markt -- more like Miet Markt, amirite?).  However, the place was newly opened and they bragged about 25 taps on the signs (now expanded 36 taps with 2 cask selections).\n\nMy first time here was during their Session Sundays - which had a good selection of local craft beer for $5.  This was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\n\nTo be honest, the tap selection isn't all too different from Volo, minus Volo's exclusive House Ales and collaboration brews.  A fair portion are pretty standard favourites from local brewers like Kensington, Muskoka and Flying Monkey.  Since Volo is within drunken stumbling from my apartment and I'm lazy, I don't go to Bar Hop more often.\n\nBut here are reasons why Bar Hop is worth a visit -- and for me, worth fighting the unwashed masses in the subway and street car ride:\n\nSTAFF - The bartender is a Jedi Master in the craft beer arts.  This man knows his shit and clearly loves his beer.  Sit at the bar to get schooled, get expert recommendations and meet the man behind some of their collaboration brews.  Hell, I've run into him at other craft beer joints around town - the man clearly loves his craft.  The best moment?  A couple of 'bros' stumble in and ask for pints of Canadian.  Mr. Bartender gave the only appropriate response: to laugh in their face for asking for swill.  Major points.\n\nThe waitstaff is also very knowledgeable and can intelligently describe the beers for you.  None of that \"Well - I like Beer Y; Beer X is popular - want to try those?\" bullshit.  In fact, I have a story - my lady settled up the bill once and in her intoxicated stupor, forgot to leave a tip on a sizeable tab after the waitress doted on us all night.  Realizing our mistake, we called the bar next day and more than made up for the missing tip on our next visit.  Not one sneer or scoff at our embarrassing mistake - We cool?  We cool.\n\nTAP SELECTION - As I mentioned, there are a lot of local craft brews - but I have seen some pretty hard-to-find stuff on rotation.  I was pretty damned surprised they offered Rogue (Oregon brewery) - one of my favourite breweries.  I'm from the west coast and I'm used to tripping over delicious hoppy taps from Elysian, Bear Republic, Rogue, Lagunitas, etc.  in Vancouver.  With this city mainly loving Belgian-style beers, it's nice to see Bar Hop offering some of the best from the west to quell my homesickness.  Let's learn our lesson from 2Pac and Biggie - let's squash the west coast vs. east coast beef.\n\nIn addition, they usually have Peche Mortel (from Dieu Du Ciel in Montreal) on tap.  Easily the best stout I've ever had and widely acknowledged as the best Canadian brew by online beer nerds.  But with 36 taps, you will find a beer you like here, trust me.\n\nFOOD: I've never eaten here - other than scavenge food from tablemates, but I don't trust my judgment in food when I'm drinking.  But the fact they even have edible food is a plus, unlike the non-existent menu at Volo.  I'm told they have have food specials on the other days of the week - but meh, food only leave less room for glorious, delicious beer.\n\nVIBE: By far the most casual and least pretentious craft beer bar downtown.  It's not a nightclub\/lounge masquerading as a craft beer bar.  It's never too loud to hold a conversation and it's not too cramped.  It's legit.\n\nOverall, my favourite craft beer bar in Toronto thusfar.  So why only 4-stars?  Well - I'm waiting for more Rogue and Lagunitas to show up... okay, it's unlikely - but with 36 taps, I have hope.
