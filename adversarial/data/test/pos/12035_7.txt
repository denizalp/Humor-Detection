I realized my faux pas with the last review.  Downtown Phoenix is the black hole of convenient delivery pizza.  Yes, there is Pizzeria Bianco but I have yet to find the time, motivation, and dinner companions to accompany me on a 3 hour wait for pizza.\n\nSo, we usually order from Domino's.  Partially because their Brooklyn style is pretty good and partially because ordering reminds me of a blog that had me laughing\/giggling\/snorting for hours: http:\/\/www.thesneeze.com\/mt-archives\/000707.php.  I occasionally find ridiculous stuff way funnier than most people would, and the thought of beef nuggets without footing is making me laugh at this very moment.\n\n*wipes tears from eyes and takes a minute to calm down*\n\nSo the ordering is incredibly easy once I stop laughing about whether or not I want the toppings on the right or the left.  And they have the \"Pizza Tracker\" which tells you what stage your pizza is in and who is completing the task.  I have to say that Wade has done a damn fine job and I'm disappointed if we order on a night that he isn't working.  Not because other Domino's employees mess it up, we have just become fond of seeing his name.\n\nDomino's no longer has the policy of delivering in less than 30 minutes or your pizza is free, but they do come damn close.  Our pizza is almost always here in a half hour (another joy of the pizza tracker).\n\nMy only recommendation is to never order the baked dessert thingies; they always taste like garlic because they're made in the same oven.
