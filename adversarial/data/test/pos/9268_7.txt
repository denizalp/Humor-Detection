Here's the thing. I know that it's awesome and has gag gifts, old collectibles, Atari and original Nintendo games, and drawers full of useless crap that nobody wants. But, can they do it with less of an attitude?\n\nI mean, everyone in there was so AFFECTED. Get over it, folks! Life isn't crap. Well, it sometimes is, but you're in a store called BIG FUN. So have some fun and crack a smile. I didn't dare try to make eye contact with the guy behind the counter for fear of being mocked. At least I had the baby so I could pretend I was there for a Care Bear or a children's book.\n\nStar Pop on the East side is another vintage\/collectible store that does the same thing with far fewer smirks.
