Setting:  Friday night at 6 pm.  Bloomfield location.  It was so cold in there.\nPlot:  I am here for beers, pizza and good convo.\nConflict:  Service was average (not good or bad).  Food came in a normal to fast amount of time, but beers were a little lagging\nEpilogue:  I will go back again. \nTheme:  Hipster pizza \n\n In my head, this place was going to be so packed that I wasn't going to be able to find a seat.  To my surprise, there was a few open tables so we sat down immediately.  \n\nThe beer list is quite extensive.  They have a wide variety of styles.  I am an IPA drinker and a few options tickled my fancy.   We started to check out the menu and guess what?  it is happy hour  until 6:30.  Half off drafts and $5 personal pan pizzas with one topping.  Cha-ching.  We ordered a salad (large enough to share) and my pizza was pretty great.  Crust was just crunchy enough and not too shabby with the toppings.
