I was very skeptical about staying here for a few reasons. 1. The mixed reviews about the room and the unsavory looking bathtub in the room. 2. I didn't know anyone who had every stayed there 3. The fact that the website is a more than a little misleading as It shows the room pictures with a big soaking tub.\n\n Because of my skepticism and the fact the price was so low I had to double check. When I've tried to book a room in the past I called to and inquired about the big tub situation. The receptionist informed me that it was not guaranteed. This was a big red flag and very off putting to me. Therefore, I opted to stay elsewhere. This time the nice lady I spoke to when I called, I think maybe a Christina or Cynthia was so nice and explained that the possibility of me getting the type of room I wanted was high, I decided to book with Rumor.\n\n You must understand, in the past when I called, they were not very helpful or pleasant. She was, and I was so glad I booked this room. I needed 2 nights, but I didn't want to book it until I saw the room.  It was awesome, especially for the price. The customer service from the lady who checked me in on Wednesday morning was great, she was so nice and assured me that if I wanted to stay the second night she would honor the same price. We called and informed them we would be staying. We loved the fact that the pool wasn't ridiculously crowded, we even got a daybed for free. I believe it's first come. They had a cocktail waitress who was also very pleasant, she even brought us lemon waters without us even asking, which was super because I was so so hot and my bottled water was no longer cold. Our cocktails were really good and we don't do foo foo drinks. I had some refreshing cucumber concoction and my husband had a grape something or other. He loved his drink!! It was delicious! \n\nOne of the highlights of our stay was a Polynesian Party they were having by the pool. It was free admission, I believe open bar for an hour and then after some drink specials. The band was awesome! Lots of reggae.  Just very chill and great vibe! We didn't leave our room and we didn't have to. We just sat out in the balcony and enjoyed the show. I did not feel like I was in Vegas at all!\n\nSince it was Wednesday and Thursday, there was no valet and this wasn't a big deal because we were so in and out. We didn't eat at their restaurant, but we did get room service. It was a burger and I found it decent. My husband thought it was overcooked. \n\nI am planning to make this a repeat stay cation for us, especially when they have the Polynesian nights! The down sides: There were only two locations to get ice, in the lobby and one of the buildings. I don't remember which one. I had a Do Not Disturb sign on the door and they disturbed. I guess the housekeeper didn't know we were staying another night. Not so bad but annoying. There also was a bartender that my husband found very rude. I didn't encounter this individual, therefore I can't explain.\n\nOh, by the way I have to mention the free porn in the room. It was hilarious! Strange, not that all porn isn't strange, but this was from like the 90's!! So so funny!
