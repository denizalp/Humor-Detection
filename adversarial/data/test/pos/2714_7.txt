For the 3rd time in a row that i have gone to this location. They do not have the  hand baskets by the main entrance. ( i figure main entrance would be where shoppimg carts are) So you have to go  to the other entrance\/ exit.   They should have them by both.   On a positive they have a great staff who are very helpfull.
