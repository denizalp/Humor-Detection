If my slightly odd, grad student TA from a media production class I took in college didn't hang out here so much, I'd probably give this place 5 stars.\n\nThe bartenders are some of the friendliest I've come across, the establishment is clean and trying less hard to be cool than the people choosing to drink there and they brew a Penguin Pale Ale. Penguins are adorable. If you're riding on the gluten-free bandwagon, One Barrel (1BBL if you're hip) also has a solid selection for you to dabble in. Brunehaut Blonde Ale? Well, blondes do have more fun. Get outta here gluten!\n\nOrdered one of the frozen Fraboni's (well, that's a whole other review) pizzas off their food menu the last time I was there and when the bartender placed it in front of my friend and I, our conversation went something like this:\n\n[Bartender] See this pizza?\n[Me] Yes.\n[Bartender] It looks delicious and it smells even better and you're going to want to eat it the minute I walk away but DON'T. You'll burn your tongue and the rest of your night will be ruined. Give it 5 minutes, trust me.\n[Me] God bless you.\n\nRight out of the oven frozen pizza sauce is straight-up lava.
