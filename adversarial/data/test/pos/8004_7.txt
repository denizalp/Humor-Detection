Lulu's Bread & Breakfast - Las Vegas, NV (Centennial Area)\n\nI know I'm late to the party.  Lulu's has been around a few years and it's taken me this long to finally give them a shot. Lulu's specializes in baked goods, but it's the Benicio Del Porko that reminds me how lucky I am to have taste buds. This monster is two eggs, on top of BBQ pulled pork, and a grilled piece of cornbread. Hollandaise sauce and corn is then added.  I was sold on just the two eggs part.  The rest was just icing on the cake.  My only complaint was to myself because I didn't get the Benicio Del Porko.  I sampled Terri R's. I had the Captain America, which is an egg sandwich with sausage, ham, and cheese.  And because I love eggs, I had two eggs added.  Take that, Captain America!!  My breakfast sandwich was great and I recommend it.  But really? Who am I kidding?  It's all about the Benicio Del Porko.
