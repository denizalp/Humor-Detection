What Happens When New York ... Meets Arizona?? You Get Chompies!  Arrowhead is open!\n\nChompies  has the old New York style ambiance and the food to match. The portions are large, really large, these portions are big enough for two. So bring a big appetite.  Chompies serves all the authentic deli sandwiches, soups, salads, bagels, breads and desserts.\n\nI've  been to Chompie's several times and have never been disappointed and now there is a Chompies close by. The Arrowhead location is open for business. The service at this location  is just like the others, attentive, and spot on. \n\n The sandwiches at Chompies are incredible. The  Pastrami and Corned Beef are perfectly lean, piled high,and oh so tender. If you make it to Chompies you have to try the Original  Jewish sliders.  These sliders are incredible. Moist lean brisket, piled high on challah roll, a mini potato pancake on the bottom,  with jack cheese, served with a side of hot brown dipping  gravy. This slider couldn't be any better.\n\n\nThe soups are wonderful, especially the matzo ball. The pastry counter is endless, you have to try the black and white cookie\n\nChompie's is a must for breakfast or lunch if your in the area!
