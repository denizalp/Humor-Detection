Made a quick stop here for some much needed ice cold water and a venti iced green tea latte. \n\nThe line was a bit long but the person on register was pretty quick and getting everyone in and out efficiently. The barista on bar was clearly backed up but held his composure as customers stood glaring. \n\n4 stars because this Starbucks location isn't skimp about hooking it up with a venti sized water and they followed the EXTRA ice request that I made . [You'd be suprised by how often employees overlook that aspect.] \nAlthough there was a slight wait, the green tea latte tasted amazing. \n\nGood Job Guys.
