Horrible experience from a place where I expected 5-star service.  The views and the cocktails were both stellar.  At an average of $20\/drink this was expected. \n\nWhat this place completely lacks is a professional degree of service.  When we arrived there was no one at the door so we began to find our own table only to be scolded by an employee to wait out turn at the door.  The hostess eventually appeared after 5 minutes only to ignore seating us so she could scold other recent arrivals that also lacked instructions to wait at the door.  \n\nFinally, after a 10 minute wait the lazy, rude, and often missing hostess decided she was willing to do her job for the night.  When we requested a specific table in the half empty bar she provided a variety of excuses that prevented us from selecting a different table.  \n\nThe manager came out and apologized for the service.  At that point, the horrible hostess literally ruined what was supposed to have been a memorable nightcap.  They need to hire additional staff to manage the door and replace the missable hostess in order to improve the experience.
