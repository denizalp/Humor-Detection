Wow! This restaurant\/lounge is amazing. It's located in \"The Hotel\" tower at the Mandalay Bay and it's an amazing french restaurant\/lounge. I had dinner there - steak and foie gras. It was excellent...\n\nI'm gluten free but had a bite or two of their french banquette with salted butter - yumm! Steak came with mashed potatoes drizzled with truffle oil. The foie gras was amazing. We can't order it here in California so it was my treat :)\n\nI had them make me raspberry martini and it was delicious too. The decor is spectacular and the views are breathtaking. \n\nThey have a lounge next to the restaurant which is cool to see if you just want drinks. \n\nMy foie gras appetizer, steak with mushrooms, mashed potatoes and 1 martini was around $150. Which is a bit expensive for one person. \n\nThey greeted me with a glass of champagne which was very nice. This is 5-star dinning all the way... You won't be disappointed.
