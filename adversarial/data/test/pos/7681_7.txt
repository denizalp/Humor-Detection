After a long day of travel I arrive at my room and just want to relax and watch some TV. Can't find the remote. I call the front desk. Long ago in a galaxy far, far, away when customer service mattered, this is a pretty easy fix. Not today. Not here at BS. She says that \"the hotel is out of remotes until tomorrow.\" And that's it. No solution. Just inform me that I have drawn the short straw in the daily \"Who gets a remote today\" lottery, and her work is done here. She then follows it up with \"There should be buttons in the back where you can turn the tv on and change the channels.\" Hey everybody, Boulder Station offers time travel! You get to watch TV like it's 1979. Can't wait to watch M*A*S*H. Oh, and by the way, there are no buttons. Not even an \"on\" button. So no time travel today, McFly.\n \nWhere do we go from here? Maybe add me to a remote control waiting list or maybe a remote control time share setup where I could use the remote of the family that headed to Hoover Dam or maybe offer to have other guests call me and tell what's happening on shows I would be watching right now. Nope, just tell me to wait till tomorrow. And other than the fact that I'm checking out tomorrow, that plan works great.\n\nSure, I'm making a big deal about a remote control. But if you can't supply a remote control in 2017, it says a lot about your establishment, be it customer service, attention to detail, the inability to handle incredibly simple things, and the desire to provide the basic services you promise in your online descriptions. And yes, this a long review, but as you well know, I have nothing better to do.
