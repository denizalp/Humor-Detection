This hotel reminds me of what I love about Montreal. It's French, it's modern yet also traditional, it's romantic and artistic, the people are friendly and at the end of the day, it's reasonably priced. \n\nLocated right on St. Sulpice, in the heart of Old Montreal, you couldn't get a better location if you're looking for a real getaway. The cobblestone streets, galleries, restaurants and stores have gone through the process of becoming hipper, local and less touristy since I lived here in this city six years ago. Now it's full of five star restaurants, hip cocktail lounges and cafés all in walking distance. \n\nLe Petit Café - basically the lobby - is small and intimate but also perfectly suited to the hotel itself. Petite dejeuner (continental breakfast) is included with the room and served downstairs. The rooms themselves are relatively large, with nicely appointed windows and comfortable beds. I loved how the walls were rustic stone, while inside the room you'll enjoy free WiFi and even a digital temperature massage shower. Some drawbacks were that my in room internet dropped frequently and the closet needed a light, but beyond that I had no complaints. \n\nWhile I was here on business, I could definitely see myself returning for a romantic weekend vacation. Voila!
