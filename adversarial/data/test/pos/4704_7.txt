I went to a yelp event here. Maybe I am wrong, but I feel like for a yelp event a restaurant will bring its A game. Apparently,  Savoy doesn't feel the same. The bartenders were quick and friendly, but in the words of Sarah S. \"Well, it's alcohol.\" Drinks... meh, nothing I would ever order again. Food was actually pretty bad. :( Service took an hour to bring salads... we actually got our food out of order.  :( Luckily, yelp people are super fun and cool so it wasn't a complete wash...
