I went to this location for the first time to purchase a pair of sugar gliders & an extra cage & to see what food they had available. I have to say I was VERY disappointed in the lack of customer service here & lack of knowledge or care of the two girls behind the counter.\n#1 When I got to the store, I was not greeted. 1 patron prior to me was, 3 after me were but for some reason it seemed that these ladies had an issue with me (maybe skin color issues? Maybe I looked like someone who was in there before?) After wandering the store for what seemed like 20min (VERY difficult thing to do in a store this small), I still didn't get so much as a \"can I help you?\"\n#2 When I finally got tired of waiting to be acknowledged, I went up to one girl behind the counter and asked what type of gliders did they have (gliders are nocturnal & were sleeping in their pouch at the time so I could not see their color). Her response was \"Oh, the regular ones\". \"Standard grey\" I asked & got a nonchalant \"Yea\" & then she returned to fiddling with whatever knick knack she was playing with behind the register. Still no \"are you looking for one\" or \"are you interested in purchasing\"... \n#3 I moved on to look at their food and other animals for sale mostly because I was waiting for my husband to meet me at the shop. The ferrets appeared ill, one had a shut\/infected eye, the reptiles were in good condition but the glider cage was filthy. The mice\/rats were packed in small cages. Also the pellet food they are recommending for gliders is not healthy AT ALL. There is too much sunflower seed & peanuts (which are high in fat & will lead to obesity & leg paralysis) & pellet food is NEVER a main diet for gliders it can cause lacerations in the mouth. Their mouths are not made to crunch pellets day in & day out, pellets will lead to lack of nutrition, self mutilation & death.\n#4 When my hubby finally got there he was greeted very warmly, then immediately shunned when the lady behind the counter saw him walk upto me & give me a hug\/kiss...\nMaybe i went in on a day whete the ladies were in a bad mood? I dont know... But having worked in retail a few years ago, i am surprised this place is still in business. In the end, I contacted a breeder & got two darlings w\/new equipment & ideas in hand. I was ready to spend upwards of $900 in this store but due to the rude behavior of the present females (there was one guy caring for the reptiles that was nice to my hubby), I instead helped out a local breeder who has much more knowledge
