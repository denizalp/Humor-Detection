Oh, Wyndham how my friends despised our stays\nOh, Wyndham, let me count the ways...\nThey need the biggest iron for getting out all their kinks:\n1, The location is good, but the parking stinks.\n(I parked 2 blocks away,\nBut I still had to pay)\n2, Customer Service is not even their hobby,\n3, The best part of my stay was the waiter named Bobby.\n4, No comfort sleeping in that bed\nThe list could go on until we're dead.
