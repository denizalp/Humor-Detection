If I could give this salon a negative-star review, I would. My experience, along with four other bridesmaids, was absolutely horrible.\n\nWeeks prior to going to Ultimate for our hair appointments, we were provided the following quotes:\n\nFormal up-do style $65 (Long hair is an extra $10)\nDown, curled and styled, $40\nShampoo Blowout $25\n\nWhen I arrived, my hairstylist confirmed that I requested my hair curled and down, but asked if I'd like just a few pieces of hair pulled back on one side for style--nothing more mentioned. Sure, why not? \n\nFor two bobby pins holding an inch of hair in place on the side of my head, I was charged for a Formal up-do style at $65. I asked for clarification, since my appointment was quoted at $40 for having my hair down, curled and styled. The woman at the counter, with the consensus of a stylist that didn't style my hair, agreed that by having two bobby pins placed in my hair, my style was transformed into a formal up-do style and would be charged as such. I was shocked. I fought it, and yet no further explanation or apology was given. The woman simply swiped my card and smiled.\n\nNot only is $40 far too much money for something that took a stylist 20 minutes to complete and nothing more than a simple curl, I was now being charged $12.50 per bobby pin that a stylist suggested I have in my hair. \n\nThe stylists did the same to all five bridesmaids, and none of us left pleased with our hair or their service. We re-styled our hair at the church, having thrown $65 at Ultimate's terrible customer service, poor communication and a horrible experience. \n\nTo make matters worse, the stylists were rather unprofessional and talked poorly about their management (we can see why), colleagues and other clients to one another and to us throughout our appointments. \n\nI'd have to agree with Ultimate's stylists, I wouldn't boast about this salon to anyone.
