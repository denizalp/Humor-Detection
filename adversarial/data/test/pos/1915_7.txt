I really want to like it here.. I  so do..\n\nIt's so close and they have wings and beer and some of the better b dub servers I've encountered,  but also some of the worst. Depending who is your wait staff can swing from why are you working here and not at a 5 star establishment, to are you on parole? \n\nFood and beer doesn't change much from location to location and here is no different.  They have a nice misted patio which I like, but they also inherited a smoking license which is cool if your a smoker, I'm not.\n\nIf only they would take corporate lead and air the PPV UFC's here I would easily come here over my normal fight bar, but they dont, and which I can't go higher than 3 stars...\n\nSide note: they got rid of my favorite feature, free refills on their lemonades!!
