I love this place! \n\nI met Nicole at the Yelp in Bloom event (see attached pic) and she invited me to the salon. I was in dire need of a haircut, so I went to her for an inverted bob. It turned out beautiful! (see second attached pic)\n\nNicole did a great job! She listened to my needs and I was very satisfied!
