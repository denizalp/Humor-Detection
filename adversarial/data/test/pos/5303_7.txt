There was one person in line ahead of me.  All I wanted was a side of chips.  I love home made chips. I waited and waited.  There were plenty of people working here but they put the slowest employee on the register.  Well to be fair, the customer ahead of me was in no hurry either.  Question after question while the employee slowly answered and kind of rolled her eyes at them.  And when they finally decided, she slowly got what they wanted.  Finally... someone else came to the counter and asked to help me.  Yes!  Because the other lady was still there.  I ordered the chips to go in a bag.  Of course, I didn't get a bag, but I wanted out of there.\n\nWere the chips worth the wait?  Nope.. super salty and some were on the burnt side.  My patience didn't pay off.
