I was looking for something a little different to celebrate a coming out party of sorts for my shiny new gf.  I have always been curious about Binkley's and now had the perfect excuse to go- s.o. is a foodie.\n\nHo.  Lee.  Crap.  \n\nI don't really know that much about food, except that when the good stuff hits my mouth my whole body wants to throw a party for it.  Chef Binkley constantly outdid himself with most of our courses.  I am not going to to give you the bite by bite, but I would feel remiss as a budding yelper if I didn't point out a few of the tastiest moments.  BTW- we went with the 5 course taster and wine pairing.\n\nWhile most of the food all night was, at best f-ing fantastic, it was at its worst, still interesting.  However, the winner-winner was not, in fact, the chicken dinner, rather the risotto.  Somewhat deconstructed, super tasty and it had these little pieces of candied bacon that takes the greatest food group to a whole new level.  Second place was my perfectly cooked fish.  Rounding out the podium was the carmel-corn dessert, where the carmel presented must know the bacon's stylist.  The rest was literally a blur of deliciousness.\n\nTo say that my date looked stunning was an understatement, but what happened to her about 3\/4s of the way through the meal was both hilarious and grounds for a michelin star.  She slipped into a grinning food coma that literally alarmed the staff and probably our fellow diners.  I swear the sommolier asked twice if she was ok, and was met by a somewhat garbled mix of words to the effect of \"food...heaven...uhhghh...risot....oohh..yes I am GREAT\"  Not tipsy- just physically rattled by the barrage of yummy food.\n\nI have to wrap this up because I must get back to the job that allowed this, oh $300 dollar meal (worth every penny) possible!
