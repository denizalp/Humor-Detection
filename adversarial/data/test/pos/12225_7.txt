My first experience at Marquee was great! The venue is nice and intimate and there really isn't a bad view in the house (this is coming from a 5'2\" shorty)!\n\nThe acoustics were good, security was easy to go through, and the bathrooms were clean and tidy. The bartenders also did a fabulous job. They were speedy and even when the lines got longer, I never had to wait more than 3-5 minutes for a drink. Parking is $10 in the lot, but there is also free parking within a reasonable walking distance near the venue.
