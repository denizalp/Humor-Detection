I sat down and asked for hot tea to start.  The waitrog (I mean waitress) brought the tea and it almost appeared that she purposely spilled the tea on the table.  Ok, maybe it was a big mistake, but then she brought an equally sopping wet rag to clean up the tea that SHE, the waittrog (is waittrog with 2 t's or one?)  spilled to only leave the big puddle of tea just moved all over the table.\n\nI thougth she would come back with a dry cloth to clean up the mess SHE, the waittrog, left.  I had to ask her to clean it up and when she, the waittrog, did, she had an equally piss-poor attitude and still left a substantial amount of the mess on the table.\n\nWe got up and left.
