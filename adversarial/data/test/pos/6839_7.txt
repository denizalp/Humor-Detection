All Ranch Markets make me feel like I'm in a fiesta as soon as I enter, and this one on Indian School Rd. on the west side is no exception. I have to thank my friend Rey of Karey's Kitchen for letting me know about this place. I mentioned to him that today (June 4) is National Donut Day and that I love the donuts at the Ranch Markets, so I was planning to go to one. He told me to go to this one, and of course I found my precious donuts ... and a whole lot more. All your senses are totally engaged in this place, from the moment you enter with the bakery tempting you with an astounding array of remarkably inexpensive treats, and even before - with the chickens roasting just outside of the entrance. Expect to find a lot of stuff you wouldn't find in regular supermarkets; case in point: http:\/\/static1.px.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/OIeGhgZD9lLJEI_GLrZ3uw\/l . You'll find a festive atmosphere in the hot foods section, the huge produce area, and the rest of the market. And it's all appropriate because when you see the large variety of foods and the low prices, you'll definitely feel like celebrating.
