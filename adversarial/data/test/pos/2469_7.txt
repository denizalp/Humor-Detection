\"Hi, my name is Stephany, and I am addicted to Bingo.\" Seriously, I am. But it's funny because now it has gotten so bad, I prefer certain bingo rooms over others, based on no real criteria whatsoever. They are all pretty standard. People in their eighties, a large bingo board or two, a lady calling out the numbers, free donuts, etc. My friends and I stick out like sore thumbs, but it does not dissuade me. The Sunset Station bingo room is my favorite. All of the previous amenities (including the eighty-somethings) are included, but the room is much larger than most around town and they offer the cool electronic bingo screens. I don't like using these, I prefer using my cool Elvis dauber, but they are offered nonetheless. Before the game starts, you can stock up on a few free soft drinks or coffee, and there is a snack machine in case you need an energy boost in the middle of the session. Get there early for the best seating. Some of the seniors are ruthless when it comes to seating. I know there are tons of ways to gamble in Las Vegas, but Bingo is by far the best. You play for an hour and can gamble as little or as much as you want. I like to go big and spend about eight bucks, but please, limit yourself. HA! Anyway...Bingo is the new blackjack, I'm telling you.\nGame times are on the odd hours starting at 11 and ending at 9pm. Check online for the best progressive payouts. I don't know what these are, but the old folks have fits about them. So I assume they are pretty important!
