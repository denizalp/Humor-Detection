I'm generally a fan of the Kimpton hotels - this was another pleasant experience.  I stayed here with 2 other gals for the PF Chang's Half Marathon.   \n\nThe service was excellent - there was some confusion and multiple stories about late checkout depending on who we asked, but other than that, staff was very helpful and friendly.  \n\nThe rooms were really nice, of course, and the grounds were fabulous - hot tub and pools.  This place is significantly more resort-y than other Kimptons. \n\nOh, and we LOVED Elmo, our little goldfish buddy!
