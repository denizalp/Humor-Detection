-Don't come to Ikea for the service...because there really isn't any...and DON'T expect it either {you have been warned!}.\n\n-Don't come to Ikea on the weekends, because it will be more crowded than a Costco with double-food sampling, plus the SLOW wandering Zombie shoppers in the mouse maze will only add to the frustration.\n\n-There is a Kid's Club place where they will watch your potty-trained kid(s) for ONE-HOUR...(if you are even 1 minute LATE, they will continuously buzz you with the restaurant-style coaster looking pager until you show up to claim your kid...)\n\n-Upstairs are the \"showrooms\" so you can see how things are done the \"Ikea\" way...grab a checklist and mini pencil in case you need to find your furniture piece in the mega-warehouse downstairs.\n\n-Downstairs have the grab and go stuff...and the shopping carts that you need to lay your body on top of in order to not slam into another shopper or knock over a display of glassware. What the heck is with those shopping carts? No wheel locks...\n\n-Get there when they open (even during the weekdays), because it gets busy...but, not as bad as the weekends.\n\n-If you can figure out how to slide a barcode over a red laser, then go for the SELF-CHECK out lane, which usually has a shorter line than shoppers waiting for the Blue shirted Ikea employee to do it for you.\n\n-CHEAP hot dogs at the snack bar downstairs...don't expect friendly service. I even saw the lady handle money and handle a hot dog wearing the SAME plastic gloves! Euw!\n\nI HATE IKEA, but I also secretly LOVE IKEA at the same time...esp their fancy ziplock-style baggies. Yes, I LOVE plastic baggies and drive across town for them, but I also write reviews about how much I LOVE QuikTrip Gas stations too....
