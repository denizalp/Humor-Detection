I've had this establishment bookmarked on Yelp for some time now and finally had the chance to check it out this weekend. I had high hopes that this place would be amazing, or at the very least full of authentic Caribbean flavors. While the experience wasn't horrible, it wasn't exactly good either.\n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly small, and can get quite loud due to poor acoustics, not ideal for a romantic date date although I thought it did have potential. The service was fantastic and some of the cocktails that we ordered were decent. The rum old fashioned in particular was delicious, most of the other cocktails we tried were too sweet\/syrupy for my liking.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but wasn't great. For apps we ordered the scallops which were probably the highlight of the entire meal. The jerk shrimp and johnny cakes were a bit bland. We both ordered the pork and polenta as mains (since they were out of the brown stew beef brisket, which was my first choice). The pork tasted like regular BBQ pulled pork, and not the best version of it that I've ever had. It had a nice smokey flavor, but if I wanted BBQ I would have just gone to BBQ. For dessert they only had one option, the sweet potato pudding\/pie. It was absolutely awful!! I have never met a dessert that I did not like, and usually I enjoy sweet potato and always love coconut, so I was shocked that we didn't even eat half of it. The only saving grace on the dessert was the ice cream, but you can't exactly mess up on scooping ice cream. \n\nMaybe their other dishes are more memorable but I don't think we will return to find out. I would possibly return for the cocktails if I were in the area. The price was quite steep as well, and I don't think the experience warranted it.
