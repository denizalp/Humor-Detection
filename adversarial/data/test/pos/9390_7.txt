I love the ambiance, and the smell of wood burning fireplace. I love how close to the office this is located. I love love love the steak salad with rare steak, that they cook perfectly. I love most of the servers, as they have been mostly wonderful.\n\nI detest that it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to have a lunch in an HOUR. For cripes sake people, you put a restaurant in the middle of a bunch of office buildings...Ya gotta assume people need to get in and out in a reasonable time frame.\n\nThey come to the table, and explain the specials, and take beverage orders. They return a while later with beverages. If you are lucky, your order is taken. Then, I believe they go to another location in another city to obtain the food. \n\nWhen you are done eating, perhaps your server will come to get plates. The checks are apparently printed in yet another location that requires them to hike long distance to get to.\n\nTurn over your method of payment if you dare.  The checks are calculated using near sighted monks in a remote mountain town. \n\nI've never had a lunch take less than 1.5 hours, up to 2 hours. \n\nHowever. I have started ordering my steak salad to be picked up, and it is heavenly. Good food, nice servers, but slow as hell service. \n\nBe aware.
