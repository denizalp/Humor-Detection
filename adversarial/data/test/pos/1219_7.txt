Be prepared to be treated like royalty here! We recently stayed at Palazzo last month which we loved, but after staying at Aria's tower suite for EDC weekend, Aria is our new favorite hands down. It's a huge suite and we got the 2nd highest floor on the building (53rd floor) w\/ a gorgeous view of the pools, cosmo, and vdara.\n\nCheck in was a breeze and the staff were very welcoming. The tower suite was so awesome, lights turned on automatically when walking into the room. I like that they also have 2 fridges in the room. 1 is free to use to store your food\/drinks like at Rio, the other is pre-filled w\/ beverages etc and it will charge you if you take it. There are 2 bathrooms in here, 1 in the living room and the other in the master bedroom. The bedroom is frickin awesome! The king bed was really big, plush, and comfy, but they need new colored sheets cause the brown isn't very romantic LOL. There were lots of pillows and they were goose feathered which I love because it's so soft. Anyway, the bathroom in the bedroom is so cool w\/ dual sinks, a nice jet bathtub, huge showers w\/ a giant seat inside, AND the best toilet ever. Yes, the TOILET PEOPLE. It's like one of those toilets in Japan that washes your butt for you!!! It was our first time using it and I really wanna get one in the house now hahah. It even has a seat warmer on the toilet and you can adjust the temperature. \n-There's tv's in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. It was nice to be in the jet bath tub w\/ bath salts watching tv\n-They provide toothbrush & shaving kits here!\n-The lotion, shampoo, body washes were good quality. Didn't leave my skin feeling dry. Loved the green tea citrus shampoo!!\n\nThe room is very high-tech, loved that the little \"ipad\" by the bed controls the ENTIRE suite, not just the bedroom. It controls the temperature, tv's, lighting in the restrooms both in the bedroom and living room, etc. The a\/c filtration system in here works beautifully, never felt dry or anything like at the cheaper hotels. I loved the bathrobes and slippers provided as well. We used the fitness facility and pools which were really clean. The fitness facility had everything your local 24\/LA fitness would have EXCEPT stair masters :( They provide you w\/ towels and water bottles as well as apples at the gym here. Next to the gym is a nice fireplace area that you can chill at, it's really tranquil. The pools are are great, we got to soak up sun w\/out being bothered w\/ lil kids running around. The jacuzzi was bigger than the typical normal circular ones. It was more like a big oval, which was nice 'cause I like my space and it didn't get as hot. There are multiple pools here and the crowd is more mature.\n\nI love that everytime we call for room service\/front desk they greet us by our last name. Speaking of which, the room service here is fast. Another nice gesture is we told the front desk it was our anniversary and they surprised us by having room service give us complimentary ammenities! I seriously felt so pampered here, the room was clean and free of any bugs. I highly recommend Aria because of the great location, professional service, and 5 star rooms. It's really relaxing coming back to this comfy suite, it was sort of like going home.
