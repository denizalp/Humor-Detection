Awful - and we didn't even eat there.\n\nAfter a small wait, we got to the front of the line. The restaurant was about half full, but they told us no more table were available. \n\nNo problem, the bar is fine. Oh - and \"we're also out of menus\". Ok.\n\nThen, the kicker! They have live beta fish swimming at each table with a floating candle in their tiny pathetic little glass bowls.\n\nWe left immediately.\n\nNow, I know someone will write and say \"Well you're eating fish - isn't it the same thing?\"  Nope, not for me. I'm just not down with animals for human entertainment.
