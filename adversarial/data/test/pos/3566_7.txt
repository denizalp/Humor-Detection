Wow! My two stars is going to elevate this place to almost acceptable. How rude is that. As soon as I walked in I knew that it wasn't going to be good. But I only ate the prime rib, shrimp and some ice cream. I came here because I was in the builing for the antique cars. Next time I will stick with that.
