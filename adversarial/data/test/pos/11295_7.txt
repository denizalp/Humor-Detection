Think this place is currently a little overrated on Yelp! It's not terrible, but just sayin' ;)\n\nThink of Bibimq as a quick lunch spot and not as a dinner spot. (ie don't bring a date here, especially if you want to get some later, it's not going to impress)\n\nBibimq is small, can squeeze 15 people inside plus they have a small patio that sits another 6-8. No points awarded for decor. It's set up cafeteria style - you order\/pay up front and they bring you out a tray with your food.\n\nIt appears to be owned by a cute older Korean couple, but they have hired a creepy old white guy to man the cash and take orders. I happened to be the only cracker eating amongst lots of Asian students at the time I visited, but I suspect at lunch hour it would be a mix.\n\nBack to the food. Strange menu including 6-7 kinds of bibimbap. Dolsot bibimbap with grilled chicken sounded good. $7.95. OK. Wait...WHAT? An EGG on top costs an extra $1??? Doesn't it always come with an egg? Grr\n\nCame out as a reasonably nice dish with one small side of kimchi. \n\nNothing special but not a bad lunch choice if you happen to be nearby.
