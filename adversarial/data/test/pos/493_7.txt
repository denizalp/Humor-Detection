I will not come back to this salon but only because Lauren my stylist is very talented, professional and personable. Ashley at the front desk was also sweet and apologized for the ride service I experienced with Gizie. While my stylist Lauren is very talented this place has significant administrative and customer service problems. They overbook the stylists. I made an appointment for 1 pm. I arrived for my 12:45 appointment at 12:49 and I was told my stylist was running behind and that she could not perform the scheduled service. One of the receptionists was extremely rude. She scolded me for being four minutes late. I will say another one of the receptionists was very nice. The owner was at the desk when all of this was happening but she didn't even apologize or try to problem solve. I was told they would only be able to do an \"express highlight\" due to my stylist being tight on time. I asked if there was another stylist who could perform the service. My question was ignored. I would have appreciated a phone call ahead of time if they didn't have time to perform my scheduled service. Normally I arrive for appointments early and consistently wait because my stylist isn't ready but I've never had an issue with this. Let's be honest though, my stylist would have still been running behind even if I wasn't four minutes late. \n\nThe prior time I came for an appointment my stylist also ran out of time so they gave me a fast blow dry instead of styling my hair with a brush as they blow dried. \n\nThere are plenty of great salons in Charlotte. There is no reason to be treated this way.
