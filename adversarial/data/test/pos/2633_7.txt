Good Bottle indeed.\n\nNow I know why you're so popular.\n \nIs it the vast selection of bottled and canned beers? Maybe for some.\n\nIs it the tidy, easy to shop, streamlined shelves and coolers? Maybe for some.\n\nWhat did it for me were the extremely well curated taps. Burial Machete Saison and Fonta Flora Brass Monkey? Who did they have to bribe or kill to get those kegs? Hi Wire Strawberry Gashes and Catawba Astral Bootie Session IPA? Who picks this stuff? Because you are \"the Man\". Did you sell your first born? Pact with the Devil? Let me guess. You're just a beer genius.\n \nAs long as I get to benefit from Good Bottle's Beer knowledge and laid back atmosphere, I'll keep coming back for more and more and more.\n\nPS My buddy John H says that they have a \"pop up\" restaurant that serves breakfast there on Saturdays. Beer + Breakfast = Beerfast. Score!!!
