After having treated my palate to incredible eateries from Paris to New York to Yountville to Mexico City, I can testify with full and complete confidence that Lon's is absolutely world class: always amazing, always perfect in every way. It can best be described as Franco-Southwestern, or Escoffier goes upscale cowboy (how do you say yeeee-haaaa en Francais?). Before I had moved to AZ, I had never tasted, nor did I want to try \"southwestern\" cuisine. Sadly, I had bought into all the cultural stereotypes of commercialized-\"Navajo rug\"-touristy kitschiness....boy was I wrong. A good friend of mine, an Italian Baron, wanted to sample the western part of the US. The first place I brought him to was Lon's. Now, Italians, especially Italian aristocrats, are absolute food snobs, which is great: they don't settle for anything less than the best, freshest seasonal quality food because that is simply the food culture in that gorgeous country! He was very well impressed with the beauty of Lon's, the quality and innovativeness of the menu...everything haute-desert, very very cool indeed! They also serve one of the best Prosecco wines very hard to find: that of Prosecco Franco from Valdobiaddene, the winery of a beautiful family and good friends of mine. Get some, it's awesome!\nLon's: fit for all, from aristocrat to lil' 'ol me. The food speaks for itself. Damn! If this place was out here in LA, it would corner the market just for its very unique menu!\nTanti auguri, bravi!!
