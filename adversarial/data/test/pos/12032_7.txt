If you're ever in the West Valley, say Goodyear area, I would truly recommend Brother's Pizza Express. It's a great mom and pop place you can't really get in Phoenix. The owners came from NYC - those New Yorkers just know how to make great pizza! :)\n\nI think I'm going to make it a tradition to stop by this place on my way to or from California since I'm hardly ever on the West Valley. \n\nTheir prices are cheap and you get your money's worth when you go. The people are very friendly and are very personable with their customers. I think if you live in the area and go their a lot it wouldn't be a bad idea to make this place your regular place for pizza. \n\nGreat pizza and customer service! Hope to stop by soon!
