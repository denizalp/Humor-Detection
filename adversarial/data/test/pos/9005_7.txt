Ma-Ma-Ma-Maggiano's I sure love you!  Why? Because you make my tummy happy!\n\nI have been going to Maggiano's on and off since the Las Vegas location opened.  I had never heard of the chain before because I am not really an Italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town.  I went here for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since!  \n\nBefore Maggiano's, I was a pasta hater.  I know, I know, I am a weirdo, but I just wasn't into any pasta.  I would only eat it if I had to, but it was never a first, second, or third choice for me.  That was until I had the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti.  This is in my Top 10 dishes ever.  That very night after eating this dish, I kid you not, I had a dream about it.  Yes, when I have a great meal, I will dream about it.  I still get this dish 99% of the time.  Every time I get it, it makes my whole day.  If I could get away with it in public, I would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because I don't want to waste one drop of that awesome Alfredo goodness.  When I do try a different dish, I often feel like I am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti Yes, I love it that much.\n\nI have tried a few other dishes (while having a food affair) and they have all been good.  I really have enjoyed the Chicken Saltimbocca, Eggplant Parm, Lasagna, and the Beef Tenderloin Medallions.  I don't think I have ever heard anyone I was with not like one of their dishes.  Yummy yum.\n\nThe kid's menu is also fantastic as well.  The food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates.  They have all sorts of pasta options, chicken fingers, and pizza.  The kid's chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes, I steal my kid's food on occasion.  Every kid's meal is $5.95 for a big entree, dessert, and a drink.  This is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kid's mediocre food.  I love a good deal!\n\nOne good tip I have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time.  This particular location always seems to be busy, no matter what time of day.  They are on OpenTable.com, so making a reservation is super easy 24\/7.  \n\nIf you have never been to a Maggiano's, you should give it a try.  And of course my recommendation would be the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti!
