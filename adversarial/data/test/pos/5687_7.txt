OMG. Mr. Barista. Your not in Seattle. I Live Pacific Northwest.  I'm not a coffee snob I can do with it or without it. But it seemed like I was absolutely bothering the staff this morning. Check the date.  Ordered mocha and a scone.  And got a look.  I'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear. Felt like I was in someone else's hood.  Get over yourselves people.  Your in Pittsburgh.
