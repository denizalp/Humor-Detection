Presto Cafe is one of the best in town at what they do!\n\nPresto Cafe is not your standard cafe.  They are a solid 4.5 stars as a normal lunch spot for me, but they also have a ton of vegan, vegetarian, and healthier options...and few do this with wraps, salads, soups, smoothies, and sandwiches as well as they do--so well that it is a no-brainer for me to give them 5 stars!\n\nI first came in for smoothies, but soon came to love the rest of their menu.  I have been a big fan of several of their daily soups, their side dishes (which are amazing), and several of their sandwiches and wraps since then.  Check out their B.Ruben, Meatball Sliders, or get a couple incredible sides and add your own protein!\n\nThe staff is helpful and wonderfully friendly and they usually have a Yelp Check-In offer too!
