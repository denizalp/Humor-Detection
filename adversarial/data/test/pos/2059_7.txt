My friend had a great experience with Superb Maids so I decided to try them myself! A team of 3 cleaners showed up right on time and took about 4 hours to clean my 2400 sq ft, 4 bdrm home.  I should also add that we have two children and 4 dogs...so there was a lot to clean!  They did a GREAT job...lots of detail, even cleaning the doors!  I would highly recommend Superb Maids!!!
