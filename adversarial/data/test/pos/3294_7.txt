Don't mean to rant, but this is Momocho II.  Similar food, drinks and decor (\"Nacho Libre\"masks, dark ambiance). The food is great. I ordered the Hongo tamale, made from mushroom and zucchini, and topped with zesty mole sauce. My cucumber margarita was quite refreshing, but not worth the $8.  \n\nAlthough the food and drinks were overall pretty great, El Carnicero will not split checks for customers, which made it extremely difficult for my table of 7 upon check out. For such a trendy, hip place, this archaic method of payment was really surprising. However, although the waitress graciously agreed to split the check because they were \"slow\" that night, it took an additional 45 minutes to complete this process. We were never notified of their policy on splitting checks prior to ordering. We never received an \"I'm sorry\" from the manager or any kind of verbalized compensation, even after asking where our waitress had been for 30 minutes with our credit cards. Overall, this was an off-putting experience that honestly turned me (and my friends) off from the visiting this establishment in the future. El Carnicero may have enticingly obscure yet good food, but it's \"foodie pretentiousness\" is annoying.  Might as well check out the commercialized Mexican joint (Cozumel) down the street for good grub and appropriate customer consideration. They split checks!
