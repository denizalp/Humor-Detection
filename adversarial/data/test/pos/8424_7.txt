Been a while since I've reviewed this location. I come here quite a bit and been doing so for many years! I love Chompies! The locations, staff, bakery\/deli, and food are A Plus! For breakfast, there are two items I get depending on what I'm craving. If I'm craving something sweet, I get the stuffed French Toast which is stuffed with whipped cream cheese and strawberry jam then deep fried. Unmatched! If I want something salty, I order the corn beef hash with two eggs. It's satisfying and delicious.\nFor lunch\/dinner I can go for the Borenstein burger with bacon and sweet potato fries or the traditional Jewish sliders. Matzo ball soup is great, too. For dessert, I'll go for their 7 layer cake, brownie, or black and white cookie. Nom nom nom.
