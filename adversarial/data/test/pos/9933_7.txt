New Tribe has long time been a popular spot for ink on Queen West.\n\nMy friend wanted some design ideas and we stopped in for a consultation.\n\nThey aren't friendly.\n\nThen again, they weren't friendly many, many years ago when I got my first tattoo, so I guess not much has changed!\n\nIf you are looking for help with a design, you might want to go elsewhere.\nHowever, when I gave them my design I drew by hand, they transferred the exact drawing onto plastic, so they could transfer it onto me.\n\nMike did an excellent job and my tattoo accurately looked like my drawing.\nHe also didn't smile.\n\nI'd rather he do a good job than chat, I guess!\n\nThis place is clean and offers services at a fair price.\nHowever, I can't say I would return for more work.
