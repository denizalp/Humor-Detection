It's about 3.5 stars. I had REALLY high expectations about FnB and was so excited to come here, but unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I think the problem is that most of the food we ordered was just OK. \n\nThe wine selection is good, I ordered a glass of red and it complemented the meal :)\n\nWe started with the duck eggs and olive goo. It was okay, but not amazing. Essentially, duck eggs with olive tepenade on a bed of greens. eh.\n\nWe also ordered the broccoli. It was better than normal broccoli, but it wasn't amazing enough that I would go back for it again. I liked the flavor of the aioli which was special and something that you should try if you go, but don't go just for this side dish.\n\nFor the main course, we got the chicken. It was fine, not great but not bad either. The food just didn't stand up to the hype...until the dessert.\n\nThe special that night was cornbread with whipped cream, ice cream, and strawberries. This. Was. DELICIOUS. I would go ONLY for dessert here. They really know their sweets. Do NOT skip out on dessert if you come here!\n\nThe service was great and I really enjoyed the waiters which is why they get the bump to 4 stars.
