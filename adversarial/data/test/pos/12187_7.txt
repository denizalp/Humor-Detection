Very mixed feelings- I've been to their East side location and liked their large selection and low prices, but felt their quality and service were lacking. Here, it's almost opposite. They have two small store spaces, one for seasonal goods and the other for more upscale product, and both feature more carefully-selected stock. The main showroom in particular has an almost curated feel to it, of coordinating decor items that are on trend.\nBut now prices are hiked up with the new location- $75 for a glass vase, $25 for a decorative Christmas tree plate, and several items that are not priced at all but I'm almost afraid to ask. But some items are solid and stylish, and high priced but still appropriate, like that huge $90 candle holder display piece I want. Like any thrift store, it's a mixed bag but at least at this location you're getting a higher product?
