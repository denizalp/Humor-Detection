The last thing a busy student needs is incompetent staff selling you the wrong books after you tell them your course and section #. That messes people up and you're unprepared for a class because someone sold you the wrong book. So unprofessional!! Went back to deal with it... Not impressed. Your screwup... I shouldn't have to settle on crappy unprofessional experiences. Step it up.
