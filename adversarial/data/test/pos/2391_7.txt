This is the best theatre in Las Vegas hands down. The prices are cheap ($8 before 5pm $10 after) the facility is nice and clean, its inside of the town square shopping mall (bars, clubs, restaurants.... cool place) but most importantly, the inside of the theatre is HUGE. There is more than enough leg room space (being 6'4 this is always an issue). The picture quality is great. If youre in las vegas and want to see a movie, this is the place to go (its on las vegas blvd, but about 5 mins south of the strip... dont go to bum ass regal cinemas next to mgm on the strip. they charge for parking and that place is small!)
