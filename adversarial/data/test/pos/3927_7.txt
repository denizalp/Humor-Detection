So my review is not based on the food, as I am a vegetarian and there is NOTHING here I can eat.  However, I have accompanied people here to watch them eat the quadruple bypass burger, which is probably one of the most disturbing things you can watch a human do to themselves, but it is oddly fascinating, too.\n\nThe last time I went, I was with two Europeans (German and French) who both tackled the quadruple bypass burger.  Nurse Stephanie served us and she really got into the shtick of the place, and was also really friendly.  The Europeans really enjoyed it, and it was a fun way to end their Vegas experience.  I didn't realize it until later, but the Europeans (who are not used to American tipping) only left a 10% gratuity.  I hope Nurse Stephanie sees this and knows that they really did have a good time, they just didn't know any better.\n\nAnd in case you're curious, the French guy was able to finish the entire quadruple bypass burger (including the very greasy bacon).  The German finished half, and took the rest for later.
