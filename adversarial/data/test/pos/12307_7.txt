I rolled in solo on a Sunday morning. I had bookmarked Kitchen Table about a month prior, so I thought it would be good to swing by since I could add myself to the waitlist right from the Yelp app! I had spent the morning at Seven Magic Mountains and and needed some grub. \n\nThe place was packed, minus the Patio. I imagine that once summer comes to a close, the patio will be magical, but there were some breve would dining in the 105 degree heat. I was not so brave and ended up at a table inside against the wall. There were all kinds of groups-ladies brunch group, families, couples-so it a great location for any occasion. \n\nMaria was my server and brought coffee and water right away. The menu is full of juicy and delicious treats that I wanted to try but I kept it simple and had a side of bacon with the Meatless Benedict. It sounded amazing, but I felt it was missing a bit of flavor. Salt perhaps? But there was none on the table and I didn't want to ask for it because you never know if it's an intentional choice by the chef. It came with a side of fruit and although I wished it had a bit more of a WOW factor in regards the flavor of Benedict, the fried green tomatoes gave a nice texture with the English muffin and hollandaise. Avocado addition was nice, but almost unnecessary.\n\nThe ambiance, service, and full choice of menu items is enough to bring me back to try more things. I won't be diving into the Meatless Benedict again, but you better believe that I'm going try the Monkey Bread that the table next to me ordered.
