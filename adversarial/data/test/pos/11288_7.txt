Cheap drinks were cool but when they said they would let our group of 20+ request a song they ultimately didn't let us love the coco.\n\nWell they did but with the polite sudden hush of a British parlour room from the Victorian era. I almost forgot dive bars were polite environments where you are supposed to sip pabst blue ribbon with your pinky out. \n\nAlso it's a sitting policy, which is exactly what we want in order to get the full grade school experience. The only time I should be told to sit down when I'm drinking is when I'm piss drunk and missing the toilet, not when I'm trying to order my first pitcher of beer. So in response I put my hand up to order drinks, but as I should have learned from school that often times you just don't get picked. \n\nThe friendliest staff member was the bouncer which is ironic. He gets 5 stars. They should really make a yelp page just for him to help their cause. \n\nAlso when I arrived there was a group of Asian foreign students singing songs. Weak.\n\nAlso the room was not green.\n\nSo boys and girls come here if you want to witness unaddressed irony unfold where witnessing nothing happen is the pinnacle of green(?) room's excitement.
