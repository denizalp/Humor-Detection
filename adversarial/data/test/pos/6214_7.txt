First off, who the hell wrote my initial review? 4 stars too? That's what you get when I'm reviewing sober!! Blah, boring and no cursing. I probably did this back when my Mom was reading my reviews. Anyways, this place kicks ass and not in the saying kind of way, but there is a chance you can get kicked in the ass here. Yeah, you're going to get the beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, that is just a given. And yes it is the perfect setting to throw down a martini or six. What I love most about this bar are the bartenders, well the martini's then the bartenders. I guess the martinis are made by the bartenders so them first? Chicken and the egg thing I guess. Autumn and Aaron have been bartending at the Wright Bar for years now and they don't get much better than these two. When you're able to text your bartender the next day to find out whether you paid or how many martinis you had, you know you're in good hands. The Wright Bar has a great set-up where you can sit inside when it's cold or you can sit inside when it's hot as hell! Okay, it does have an amazing patio, but I feel like it's too far away from the vodka. The Wright Bar is my go to when I'm feeling like a nice martini and light conversation. Sit back, relax and enjoy the beauty of the Biltmore, it doesn't get much better than this! \n\nP.S. Be careful with your Aura here, you may be called out if it's too big for the bar. That's a whole other story which I'll tell you if you ever at the Wright Bar!
