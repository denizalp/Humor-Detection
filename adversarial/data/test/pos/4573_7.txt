I love Mexican food, born in Tucson, we have so many options. Well, I have been to several Phoenix Mexican restaurants, this one is in the top 3 Mexican restaurants I have ever been to. The best in Phoenix by a long shot. The canitas tostada over the top, perfect seasonings. The tacos are great. The Quesada really good. We will be here twice a month at a minimum, did I mention the proudly display their grade A health department score. Great service too. Table side salsa, cucumbers etc. Really need to try this place, we found it on Yelp, ***** all the way!
