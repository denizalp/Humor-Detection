We go to Novanta at least once a month, and have settled on a few favorite dishes.  Their salads serve as great starters.  While their sizes are shareable, my husband and I usually get our own.  He likes the Dolce e Crostata--with goat cheese, golden raisins, and candied walnuts--while I prefer the grilled Caesar--with deliciously charred romaine, tomatoes, and sliced bread, and homemade dressing.  We also love the arancini, and do often share that when we are not in the mood for a salad.\n\nFor entrees, you can't go wrong with their pizza.  It's one of our top favorites in the CLT area, as it's cooked in a wood-fired oven, and is perfectly crispy on the outside - no soggy crust here!  I like their pastas, with their lasagna being truly exceptional, having fresh layers of pasta, mozzarella, and meat sauce, all made to order.  \n\nIf you have room for dessert, I highly recommend the deconstructed cannoli.  It's homemade, and divine.  Their gelato is well thought-out, served with a side of espresso to soften the ice cream and add a unique flavor.  \n\nPresentation is very careful and well-thought out.  Service is always good as well.  The gentlemen at the pizza bar are especially friendly, and fun to talk to.  \n\nWe love this place, and will keep it on our \"short list\" for nearby dining!
