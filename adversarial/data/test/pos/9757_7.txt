This small little shop in the Palette Collective serves up some tasty and unique beverages. The words hand crafted and artisan come to mind when I think of the selections here. After browsing through the delicious sounding menu choices, I decided on an iced honey lavender latte with almond milk. The drink was a lovely sight to behold, with an ombre transition from honey layer, espresso layer, milk, and a delicate dusting of crushed lavender petals on top. The taste, once mixed up, was smooth and refreshing. It was lightly sweet and you could definitely taste the essence of lavender in the drink. After talking with the barista it turns out they use a special lavender bitters to flavor the drink, very nice!\n\nThe coffee they use is locally roasted in Phoenix, which is another plus for those that want to shop local. \n\nService was warm and very friendly. \n\nWhile I did enjoy the latte, I do have a slight preference over the coffee they use at Infusion but this shop comes in a close second for a fine caffeinated brew. Overall 4.5\/5.
