After missing my usual green tea cake fix at Goyemon for the longest time, I received a very helpful tip from Yuki (one of the Goyemon waiters) that Chef Misuzu had recently opened her Japanese style patisserie on Durango and Warm Springs(Next to Jiffy Lube) on the Southwest side of town.\n\nIf you've dined at Goyemon and\/or Kabuto, you more than likely have had one(or a few in my case) of her signature items-Green Tea Cake, Tofu Cheesecake, Mille Crepes, etc. They can all be found here at Suzuya. Also having worked at notable places such as ALEX and the Pastry Shop at Aria, Chef Misuzu is no joke, and it shows in all of her creations. Very aesthetically pleasing to the eye, the Japanese palate leans more toward seasonal, natural, delicate flavors and textures, not overly too sweet, or too rich and decadent. Although the presentations may look a little American and European, the flavors are dominantly Japanese. Sorry, you won't find grossly huge portions, Ganache covered, ooey gooey overly decorated\nsweets to cause a sugar coma, or artificial ingredients or colors to please the eye.\n\nI am also a huge fan of the Japanese style crepes served here as well.(Even better than that crepe joint in Japantown, SF) We shared my usual Green Tea Cake(The latest version is with a hazelnut cream and chocolate covered crispies) and a Strawberries and Whipped Cream Crepe with Green Tea Ice Cream as an add on(ice creams are also made in-house) at $4.50 for any of their 5 different creations-Strawberries and Whipped Cream, Banana and Chocolate, Blueberry and Cream Cheese, Nutella and Almond, and Apricot and Custard with add-ons for $.25-$.75 more, this is one of the best deals in town. The crepe was so soft, just slightly sweet,and a nice chewy texture, the addition of the fruit, cream and ice cream made every bite enjoyable!...So enjoyable, we had to get another crepe and I also noticed they just put a tray of Kabocha Squash Pies in the display case, so we had to get one of those as well!\n\nThe time and care put into preparing each crepe is also evident as insta-read laser thermometers are used to get a specific temperature before cooking each crepe\nnot too hot that it wil brown or dry out the crepe, not too cold that the batter will stick. The end result is a very soft, pliable crepe, pale yellow with very little to no color and a nice delicate flavor and perfect vessel for the assorted fruits and toppings. This time we tried the Apricot and Custard. The slight tartness from the fresh apricots paired well with the vanilla-infused custard. The Kabocha Pie was a hit as well served with a crisp puff pastry crust, gently dusted with cinnamon and served with lightly sweetened wipped cream....Absolutely ONOLICIOUS!!!\n\nBefore you go:\nWed-Mon. 10-6pm, closed Tuesdays\nCall ahead to check for selections (they were out of the Mille Crepes dessert when we went)\nLooking forward to returning and trying all of the other creations at Suzuya...ALOHA!!!
