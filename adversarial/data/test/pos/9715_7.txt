\"Le damn\" this place is good!\n\nCame here with my wife during our \"Buffet of Buffets\" outing and our \"breffas\" was so good we came back again and paid regular price after our pass expired.\n\nThis is definitely the place to go for breakfast or brunch. The only bad thing is that you're in Vegas and who the fuck wakes up before 11am? Well if you haven't gone to bed yet and you feel like the best breakfast buffet in town then you've come to the right place. This place has everything from custom crepes to eggs benedict. Just a great selection overall. The only issue I had was the damn crepe line, that shit was a 30 minute wait!\n\nBesides that, the atmosphere is cool. It does its best to replicate a small french village with the tables in the center of the whole thing. The painting of the sky helps create a unique dining experience.\n\nOverall, I haven't found a better buffet for breakfast so this place gets my top rating. I can't wait to go back and \"manger comme je n'ai jamais mang√© avant!\"
