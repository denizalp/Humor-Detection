Surprised to see so many negative reviews for Planet Fitness. I may have just joined but I've been really, really impressed. When I first came in for the tour, I was trying to find the \"catch\" that made it so cheap. I could not find one. \n\nFor $20 a month you are part of a 24\/7 gym with unlimited tanning, massage chairs, and massage beds. The gym is staffed 24\/7 so you don't have to tan during limited staffed hours either. Running a tanning bed is expensive! How do they even make money?! You can also bring a guest every single time you work out and you get half price drinks so can get a big 700ml cold water for $1. Not bad at all. \n\nMust be a crazy long term contract or cancellation fee, right? Nope. You just have to cancel 10 days before your bill date. Goodlife requires 30 days for some odd reason PLUS their $99 cancellation fee. You can also go to any Planet Fitness location, including in the States. \n\nSo I figured they obviously won't have classes. But they do. I've yet to use any of them so far but the fact that these exist is crazy for a gym of this price. \n\nStaff are everywhere. In my times there so far, I've seen staff cleaning machines, the water fountain, etc. They ensure everything is kept well maintained and the gym is beautiful as a result. As an aside, I love the purple machines! \n\nThe different circuit rooms are also really cool. I know Goodlife on Main had a similar \"circuit\" but having it in its own special room with light cues? You can't beat that. \n\nAll in all, I don't even understand how this place functions. I used to work at a small community gym and so know the costs of running a business of this sort. Offering memberships at these prices does not make sense to me at all but I am not asking too many questions. \n\nPretty much, if you're paying $10-$20\/month for a membership here and you don't think you're getting your money's worth, you are a crazy person.
