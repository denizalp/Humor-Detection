I remember this place used to be good 20 years ago. I would give it two stars but the service was good, the location is great, the patio and inside of the restaurant is nice so one extra star for ambience and location!\n\nFor breakfast, meat options are all pork except for smoked meat. And the smoked meat was pretty horrible. It was fatty, tough and unappetizing. It's just an overpriced place with mediocre food. \n\nThe freshly squeezed orange juice or grapefruit juice is excellent. I wish it was bigger.
