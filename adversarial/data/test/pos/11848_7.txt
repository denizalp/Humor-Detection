***Everyone please be weary of any review by someone who just made a Yelp account, doesn't have a picture, no friends, and their only review is for Bishop Park Apartments. The owner found out about my review January 2015 and after making a snide remark to me he now has people writing up glowing reviews for him. Suzie F. didn't you work in the office?\n\nI stand by my original review. This place is not atrocious, but only live here if you don't have a better option. In my case, I was a young college kid who just moved to the city and didn't know any better. \n\nPros:\nMy apartment faced North so my view was of trees which was nice.\nSome of the staff were pleasant and helpful. \nIt's close to the highways. \n\nCons:\nAlthough better than East Cleveland or Euclid, the area is still not that great. \nMy unit was outdated and the carpet was very stained. \nI had ants in my apartment and I know they brought in pest control several times for other units. \nNumerous times the water was shut off for repair work without notice. \nThe elevators were constantly out of service.\nFlooding from a bad roof caused a lot of damage to many units including mine.\nYour rent will go up every year. \nWasher\/dryer were outdated and before I left they increased the price to use them.\nWalls are thin; I could hear people watching tv, alarms going off, vacuums, raised voices, people walking down the hall, and people having sex. \nThe owner was constantly a terror to deal with throughout my time here and a bad owner really negatively affects a person's experience with the business.
