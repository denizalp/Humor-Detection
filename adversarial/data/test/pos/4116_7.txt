So a gal walks into a bar...\n\nI've been in the bar business and I know the rules.  The rules are: it's a \"bartender's bar\" and it's a \"customer's table\".  You may not like that, you may never have heard that, but in the bar biz, that's true.  \n\nNow, no one should confuse any of that with \"the customer is always right\".  Confusing?  Not really.\n\nSo I walk into Zipps, and I order a vodka and Red Bull and I explain to the bartender that I want a glass large enough to allow for the full shot of vodka and the whole can of Red Bull.  that's the portion.  He gives me like an 8oz rocks glass with vodka but there's no room for the Red Bull, as I had tried to avoid.  When I protest, he says he does not have a glass large enough to hold both.  \n\n\"What about that glass?\" I asked as I pointed.  \"Oh, that's a Pilsner glass.  It's only for beer.\"\n\nHell, whenI ran a bar, I would give a customer a shot of 25 year old McCallan Scotch in a Martini Up glass, however inappropriate it might be.  S\/he can order it any way s\/he wants.  But not at Zipps.\n\n\"Wait.  You can't use a Pilsner glass for my vodka\/Red Bull because....\"\n\n\"Because it's only for beer.\"\n\n\"Wait.  You don't wash it afterwards?\"\n\nHe just stared at me.  I just stared at him.  Dude was seriously challenged.\n\nI don't care how good the blue cheeseburger was.  I can't call my glass, they don't get my money.  Hamburger money or vodka\/Red Bull money.
