An exquisite dining experience in the heart of the Strip at the Aladdin Hotel Desert Passage.  I started with the Commander's Salad, which was awesome, then moved into the Creole Seasoned Filet, awesome, and finally the bananas foster, uh...awesome.  My colleagues had the creme brulee, which looked truly amazing, and the bread pudding. Service was personal and impeccable.  I would never have gone to this lavish place had it not been a business trip \"perk\", but it was a memorable extravagance.
