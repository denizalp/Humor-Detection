BOOMING SPOT TOTALLY HIT THAT SPOT!!!!!!!!!  for all you HOT POT lovers this is a must try!! ok i was totally bummed out with the all you can eat hot pot @ dragon house shutting down... So my friend and I decided to give booming spot a whirrl!.. and i must say I was so freaking happy  I tried it\n\nI tried the beef hot pot.. You get your own mini pot all veggies are organic veggies and the broth is really good and i must say everything just tasted so good and fresh!\n\nMy friend she had the CAGE FREE chicken .. Can you beleive that?! what place has CAGE FREE chicken for a hot pot.. BE WARNED it is boney and not enough meat but who cares its still good for you! just make sure you don't choke on the bones!\n\nAs for drinks i had the citrus tea.. really good and refreshing...\n\nFor the sides we had the Lamb scewers and it is to DIE FOR! you must try it!!\n\nOverall i give this place a 5 star.. \n\ngyeah i admitt i was sccccccured going to the location.. me and my freind was like ok time to put our rolexes in our pockets before we get jacked! the location is kinda crappy in the hood spring mountain and jones right next to some shady massage place behind Church's chicken!\n\nI hope BOOMING POT BOOMS on the  HENDERSON SIDE OF TOWN! saves me the trip.. but its still worth the drive...\n\nSo for awesome hot pot.. GO TO BOOMING SPOT MINI POT IT WILL SURE HIT THE SPOT!!  :)
