In a word: wretched.\n\nThis property in NO way lives up to the expectations of a Starwood property.  Had I taken more time to check it out, I would've happily paid more to stay elsewhere.  Rooms have an \"aged\" scent, can't open the windows to get any fresh air, it's in a bizarre location.  Coffee in the rooms is good-to-the-last-drop \"Maxwell House\" even for Preferred Guests.\n\nThe next morning went downstairs for the buffet for some food, waited almost 10 minutes to be seated (per the sign \"Please wait..\") only to be told to seat myself.  Lovely.  The hot food platters were almost all empty, with no more in sight.  Not that what was left looked GOOD, but well, something would've been nice.  I just took my book and left.\n\nPaid $95\/night, felt overcharged.\n\nPerhaps when the economy turn around, Starwood an build a new airport hotel.  This one would make an excellent candidate for a juvenile detention facility.\n\nI'd take some pictures of the property and post them, but I don't want to scar my phone.
