Vegan fuckin' donuts dude.\n\nEvery other donut bakes up wishing it could be these donuts. \n\nThis will be the best thing you put in your mouth in the mornings before work or the mornings after partying on the strip (or you know, both at the same time). Best thing - I don't care how good your lover is, BEST THING YOU'LL PUT IN YOUR MOUTH THAT MORNING.\n\nThey're fresh. They're served with a smile. They're super inexpensive. They're delicious. They're VEGAN. \n\nNomnomnomnom is the only actual necessary words. I had to write this review hours after eating there, because literally I spend the last several hours going \"nomnomnomnom\" until my brain remembered it had other thoughts.\n\nYou know when you fall in love and all you have is stupid romantical thoughts about your new love interest while you're supposed to be doing things like working or grocery shopping or being an adult in general? Yep, that's how I feel after Ronald's Donuts. I was thinking of writing them poetry. Maybe I will.\n\nNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM.
