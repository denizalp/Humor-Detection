I can't even post a picture because I ate it so fast! This is my hubby's and my go-to place for ice cream! I would like to consider myself an ice cream connoisseur and have been to most places in Phoenix- but this definitely takes the scoop!\n\nMy favorites are cookies and cream, orange screamsicle, and honey comb. My husband gets the bourbon brittle and swears by it! \n\nThe service is always great and everything is always clean!\n\nWe will be back again and again!
