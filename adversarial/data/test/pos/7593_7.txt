We chose Dr. Bakerink from the beginning because he doesnt force you into anything. His approach is so warm and friendly and extremely prifessional. He doesnt talk down to you or force his own personal beliefs on you. He educates us as this was our first child and she spent her 1st 6 months in the nicu he took on her difficult case with an open mind and a positive attitude exactly what we needed. We always felt better when leaving even tho he wasnt an expert in her condition he would bring her in to see her in emergency and gave us lab slips and resources. He was key and indispensable part of our medical team when our child life was at stake. We love Dr. B and would recommend him to any family.
