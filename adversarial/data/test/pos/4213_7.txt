I only come to this location if I need something in a hurry because it's the closest location to me. \nI kid you not every time I go there's either a fight inside or outside going with cussing yelling and employees trying to break it up. \nThis store is ghetto but the employees are always nice and helpful. \nI recommend sprouts or Trader Joe's for a alternatives lol.
