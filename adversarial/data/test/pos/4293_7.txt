Absolute most horrible service I've ever encountered before in my life.  Came in tonight at 7:30 PM, was seated immediately and then that's about where it stopped.  Ordered drinks and took 15 minutes to receive.  Didn't have ginger beer for a Moscow mule and didn't have any Smirnoff vodka.  Thirty minutes went by and our server Elena, never even took our order.  Walked by us probably about four or five times.  After over 40 minutes of waiting to take our order we decided to say to ourselves f this place and move on.  The matre'd didn't even apologize or offer to comp the drinks.  Paid for the overpriced drinks and server expected a tip asking if I wanted change.  I don't think so! Worse service ever and I WILL not be coming back again!  Seriously after the long ass wait, the server seemed almost confused as to why we were leaving.  Yelpers, please use high caution coming to this place if you value your time which is an extremely high commodity nowadays.  No apology or nothing, NEVER AGAIN!
