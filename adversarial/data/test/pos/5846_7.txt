When I pulled up I was very skeptical of this place.. kind of old and run down and in a sort of off part of 16th street next to Circle K.. well I was meeting friends and Amy D. had talked so highly of it so I couldn't back out now. My friends showed up and were kind of scared though they haven't been out with me for ages so it would be an adventure for them. Ill dodge bullets for a good bite to eat and they know it! \n\nBurgers, fries shakes and a few odds and ends on the menu well, here it goes. Ordered a half pound burger with cheese and a side of fries, 4.99 as well as a strawberry milkshake.. I was making sure we all ordered what they are known for, good burgers, fries and shakes.. okay, so I'm blown away! The burger was totally juicy without being greasy.. the fries were crispy and flavorful and the shake tasted like it should have.. thick, creamy and fruity! My friends all LOVED the food here and were thanking me on the way out.. so much for it being scary. \n\nLucky Boy rocks! The burgers remind me of how a good burger should be, simple, tasty and cheap. Now that's American!
