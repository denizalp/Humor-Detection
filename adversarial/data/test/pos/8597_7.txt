Like the rest of you, I was inspired to go to this show for the complex plot and character development... Instead, I was shocked to find a Vegas show with gorgeous showgirls singing and prancing around on the stage.\n\nAgainst all common sense, I stayed and watched the show. The segments are very entertaining. Lorena, the singer, is multi-talented. Sean E. Cooper provides some entertainment but probably stayed longer than he should.\n\nThe showgirls... ah, the showgirls. In a city where attractive women are all over the place, these stand out. They're gorgeous, talented, and absolutely mesmerizing. The name of this show may be the most accurate description of any show in Vegas.
