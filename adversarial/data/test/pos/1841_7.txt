I have stopped at this location several times in the past couple weeks on my commute.  The best way to describe this is that it is average.  \n\nEverything that you would expect from a Wendy's you would find here.  Nothing to write home about.  \n\nUnlike other Wendy's, the drive-thru here is actually fast and efficient.  Never had a problem or a wrong order come from here.
