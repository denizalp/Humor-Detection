What a long day!  We drove for five and a half hrs and finally made it.\n\nWe checked in at 3 pm after M's wedding.  I took a short nap and found the room to be cozy.  It had two nice swimming pools.  Unfortunately, I forgot my swimsuit since the night before I was running around the house like a mad woman trying to get my stuff together.  \n\nIf you're not planning to hang out at the hotel all day, then this place will do.
