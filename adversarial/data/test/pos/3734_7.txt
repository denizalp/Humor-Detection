For $8.95 Pink Pepper offers all you can eat soup, salad, appetizer, and various entrees with iced tea included. That's a heck of a deal! The decor is like '80s-90s style, and the layout is spacious and uncluttered. The dishes are a mix of Thai and Chinese style dishes you'll definitely find something pleasing to get at the buffet.\n\nThere were quite a few items to choose from, such as tempura vegetables, wonton salad, chicken curry, eggplant, BBQ pork, and the ubiquitous pad Thai. My favorites of the bunch were probably the BBQ pork and the fried fish. The curries had a mildly spicy kick with a lot of meat but had a very thin watery sauce.\n\nThey had two soups today, a seafood (krab) egg drop soup and what looked to be hot and sour soup with mushrooms. I tried the egg drop soup which had good flavor but had a very thick consistency.\n\nDesserts included small Chinese style donut holes and fresh fruit such as melon, orange, and pineapple.\n\nThe quality in general isn't the best but for the price the buffet is a good deal especially since iced tea is included.\n\nThis restaurant has been here forever it seems like, since I remember seeing the big Pink Pepper sign as a kid. They're definitely doing something right if they've been here for decades!\n\nThe buffet is for lunch only and lasts until 2:30 P.M. I'll be back next time I want to gorge myself on Thai food!
