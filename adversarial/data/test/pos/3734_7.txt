place is a little dingy but the food is good, greeks know how to cook. dude who owns or runs the joint never ever ever never smiles, which lends to the overall entertaining experience. you get what you pay for and sometimes more. if the place was clean and the service was professional and the food was the same, the bill would be double. i love the joint for what it is. good tasting garbage food with a sassy staff, AWESOME!
