I liked this place a lot. Pulling up we thought it would be super pretentious but it wasn't. Our server was awesome and very nice but overworked which I hated to see. The place was full on patios and there were only a couple servers! \n\nI had the pasta carbonara and it was pretty good! $14 and tons of leftovers, I'm good with that! The only thing that annoyed me was the very cheap wines on the menu that cost more than a bottle of the wine at HT. Also would have loved dessert but it took way too long to get our food. \n\nPretty views and good food, we'll be back!
