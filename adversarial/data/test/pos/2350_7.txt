Perfectly Fine\n\nI am so glad I stumbled onto US Egg on Bell Road.  What a terrific find this was for breakfast.  One thing I truly appreciate about US Egg,  there is \"No Waiting\" you're always greeted and seated immediately.  \n\nUS Egg has plenty of seating with a full and friendly staff ready to accomdate your every need .  US Egg offers an extensive menu for breakfast with all your breakfast favorites. Your entree is prepared as you ordered and the portions are large.\n\n I would highly recommend US Egg for breakfast, especially if you're really hungry. Whatever you like: egg dishes, pancakes, waffles, etc. they have it. Tip: if you're not a hearty eater, ask for a half-size portion. It's still a lot of food.
