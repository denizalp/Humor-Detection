Fous Desserts is a small little cafe that offers coffee beverages, individual cakes, truffles, as well as pastries.  I really liked that they had a small little chocolate pig that was all wrapped up, ready to be picked up by someone :P  I bought an almond croissant and a cheese croissant, both tucked in their individual bags - I appreciated this, as I did not have to worry about the sticky almonds sticking to the cheese croissant!  The cheese croissant was forgettable, as the cheese was a bit too pungent; however, the almond croissant was quite delicious, as it had this lovely honey-like glaze that gave the croissant a nice little crisp; there were also a nice amount of almonds on top.  Staff were super friendly, and there were some seats available for you to do some work or to enjoy your treat.  Just a note, there is a $5 minimum for CC usage.\n\n+almond croissant \n+friendly staff\n+cute chocolate pigs :D\n+truffles available
