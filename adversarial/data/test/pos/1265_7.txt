The atmosphere is nice , good place to study . But just for drinks ? Terrible . The drinks I got was not worth it for the price , I rather go to Starbucks . It's okay to go just for the experience of the cafe atmosphere . Also do not expect you to serve you your drink they tell you to get it yourself although you have to mandatorily pay a tip when paying by card . I don't understand this . The ice matcha latte taste like 1 dollar it is literally just iced milk with green colour and zero matcha flavour . It was priced  at 7 dollars but taste like 1 dollar , I do not recommend this drink . Come if your in the local area however do not come if you are purposely wanting to visit , it is not worth the trip .
