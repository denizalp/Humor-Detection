Day 19 of vegetarian month...why didn't I come here EARLIER?? This place is awesome! Yeah yeah its a hole in the wall but what vegetarian\/vegan can say no to a menu like this? \n\nAfter going through all the awesome Yelper reviews\/recommendations I got a take out order of: \n\nVegetarian pork skin rolls: I probably would've believed these were actually crispy pork skins if no one had told me. Great appetizer that was tasty but light. \n\nVegetarian Black Pepper Beef Steak with Special sauce: This was great. The consistency of the protein was as close to beef as I've had at a vegetarian joint and the sauce was great. \n\nVegetarian Fish Steak with Mixed Vegetables: They shaped the protein like mini filets of sea bass with black skin etc but it was still tofu in the end. Not bad but the \"beef\" was way better. Sauce was sweet which I wasn't so into either. \n\nI'm curious to see how they do shrimp and pork chops so that'll be what we go for next time. We'll certainly be back before Jan end since I am running out of home vegetarian recipes that are satisfying haha.
