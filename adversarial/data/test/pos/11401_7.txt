The food was really good. We had chicken fried chicken and our choice of 3 sides and there is a wide selection of sides. The fried apples are great, and the mashed potatoes are good too. I liked the sweet potato.....it was good too! Shanelle M was our waitress and we got great service. She was funny....we really liked her. This is a great place to come for comfort food and the service is good and we didn't have to wait long for our food considering how busy they were....I would for sure recommend this place.
