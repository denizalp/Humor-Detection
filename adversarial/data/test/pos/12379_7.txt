Gorgeous club! Dress to Impress and totally worth the cover! My sis and I loved the place so much we went 2 nights in a row and almost for a third.\n\nXS has set the bar high for all nightclubs. Props to the designers who put so much thought and detail into the place from the pool to the bathroom full of lotions, hair sprays, gels, etc. to the trippy nipple art behind the bar that looks like the nipples are following you...lol. The dance floor does get crowded during peak times and can get stuffy, but solace can be easily attained with a mere stroll over to the outdoor patio and pool area. Towards the end of the night, girls take off their shoes and start dancing in the pool to relieve the pain of dancing in 4 inch heels all night.\n\nPlenty of bars with fast bartenders everywhere so waiting for a drink is not that bad. They also have girls going around selling shots. Great place for large groups with plenty of tables and cabanas surrounding the pool. The only thing is that they only have one dj and dance area, but they play a wide variety of music.\n\nIf you're a group of hot girls, they'll take you to the front. But for boys, make sure to have some girls or else you might not get in. Or try to find some girls in line to go in with...lol. It's such a small world and you never know who you might meet.....=)
