I am absolutely IN LOVE with Just Baked! I was very surprised to see some of the other reviews because my boyfriend and I absolutely love this place! I order all my cupcakes for events from here! I found out about Just Baked when they ran a Groupon last year. I was a little put off as well about them only serving 6 flavors a day BUT when I talked with the owner it made sense because with only 6 flavors, the cupcakes stay fresh. There is another well-known cupcake business literally right across the street and I'm not as big of a fan because they make several flavors a day and I can tell that because of this, they sit longer and aren't as fresh. They're more dry. \nSo long story short, having only 6 flavors a day is WAY better! And the great thing is if you want to place a bigger order, you can have any flavor you want! \nJust Baked, you're amazing and even though I'm trying to eat healthy I still love to splurge on your amazing cupcakes!
