Went to this location for lunch with a friend.  Food was good, not great.  Service was better.  But the place was dead.  Deader than GPS systems.  Deader than fax machines.  It's a beautiful restaurant with decent food and a zillion TV's with pretty girls waiting tables...how is it dead?\n\nPrices were high, maybe that's the reason.  \n\nBut people should definitely go to lunch here.  These girls need your help.  They barely have enough money to clothe themselves.  Seriously.
