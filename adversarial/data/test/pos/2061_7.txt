Man. This review is long overdue. Long, long overdue. What is a restaurant with wings? Should such a place exist which specializes in something that is usually cast aside as an appetizer, rather than being the main course? Oh wings, thou art humble, and we have dishonored you at many eating establishments. We have treated you with disrespect. We have ALL sinned. We call places such as \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" or \"Wing Stop\" proper places to seek you. \n\nIts not too late though. There IS hope. You can be redeemed. ATL Wings exists, and you can achieve chicken wing nirvana here. :) \n\nWhen it comes to wings, this is THE place. A chicken wing heaven on earth with well over 200 flavors. Their signature \"ATL Style\" is a must try upon your first visit. I've attached a few pictures to give proof to the miracles I witnessed being made from scratch in this place. Their lemon pepper is exquisite. Traditional buffalo, from mild to toxic, are absolute delicacies. Rick Ross should have invested here. Lol\n\nStill, I'm glad he did not. I feel lucky to have this locally owned spot in my neighborhood that effortlessly sons all the competition. That's right. I said it you other wing places out there! ATL Wings is your father! You are only allowed to make wings with his approval and only for so long. ATL Wings is coming for you, and your lunch money is being revoked.
