We went in looking for a  beginner's guitar and were immediately assisted by this wonderful man (sorry I forgot his name).He played many of the guitars for us and answered all our queries.\n\nGuitar Center true to its name has an extensive variety of guitars both electric and acoustic as well as other musical instruments mainly drums and keyboards.I love that the store is super organised makes browsing easy also they have a separate room for acoustic guitars where you can sit, play, listen to how the guitar sounds before you decide.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant experience and something about music stores always makes me happy.They do sell used instruments and also offer rentals.\n\nDid I mention we ended up buying an acoustic from Yamaha?\nBecause music describes what words cannot.\n\nCheers!
