Came here for Sunday brunch and it was pretty tasty. Bottomless mimosas, zesty chilaquiles, fab cheese board, scrumptious butternut squash and decent posole. My only negative is how fatty the pork was in the posole. Made it hard to eat. But... very attentive and helpful service, clean and fresh space too. We loved the guitarist on the patio as well. I woukd return and try a few other items. It is that good.
