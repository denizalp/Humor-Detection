Compare to Patisserie La Cigogne's location on Bayview, this location on Danforth is huge with this nice side shaded patio..... \n\nGreat selections of French pastries and individual cakes...and great services... \n\nGreen Tea cake ($5.25) has great matcha taste and with a great nutty taste that compliment each other. It is a little pricey.... especially in this neighbourhood?? \n\nNice staff helps me select some chocolate and truffles to surprise my friends.. Caramel, Black Currants and Hazelnuts? My friends seemed to enjoy them without complaining? I guess they must be quite good. \n\nI definitely be back to have a cappuccino and croissant on the patio next time when I am in the neighbourhood!
