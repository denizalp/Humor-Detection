Yabba dhaba dude!!\n\nThat was the first thing that came to mind when a friend and I decided to place a delivery order and it arrived 35-40minutes later (sooner than the hour we were told) and the food was HOT (like piping hot) and the containers were packed to the brim!\n\nEchoing the initial concern of Sunny G, I too was worried that take-out would be lesser quality, smaller portions and likely arrive cold. Not so... not even a little. \n\nTogether we shared a Chicken biryani, Butter chicken, Lamb vindaloo and 2 garlic naan. Totaling about $55, reasonable considering delivery was free because we spent more than $35 AND there was an additional 10% discount for ordering our food via their website!\n\nIt's been a long time since I last had \"Good\" Indian cuisine and my friends this is certainly GOOD Indian. I don't know how others are putting Aroma (an Indian restaurant chain) in even the same league as 309 Dhaba, it's not even on the same planet. Dhaba wins... every... single... time. \n\nWhile I won't go through each dish individually, here are the reasons why collectively, Dhaba is way bheta (get it):\n\n1) Excellently seasoned and cooked - as the advertisement says, Indian food is NOT spicy... it's cooked with a mix of spices BUT they certainly bring the heat.\n\n2) Expertly Cooked! Chicken in the Biryani and Butter Chicken was moist and plump. HOWEVER, the winner was the Lamb Vindaloo, cooked perfectly tender while still maintaining some of its lamb flavour, mixing well with the fiery sauce\n\n3) HUGE portions. I've had Indian cuisine across Toronto and the GTA and never have I seen so much food for a price. There is no skimping on portion size at Dhaba! They dole our huge generous portions of meat with each dish. Excellent bang for your buck!\n\n4) Their Garlic Naan made me pee a little in my pants (just a little) as it tickled my taste-buds in a way garlic and tandoor cooked bread has never tickled me before!\n\nOverall this his all my Indian food hot spots: Price, quality, quantity, flavour, spice and service. This place is just shy of the best I've ever had but it's damn close!!!
