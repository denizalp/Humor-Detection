I am a Pita Jungle fan but this location did not do it for me. Between the two locations I always dine at (Downtown and 7th street) this one was not my best first experience. Less than a week ago was my first experience at this location. Beating the lunch crowd myself and two other guest were the only ones at our long table. The bartender was our server who took a while to come by to ask what we wanted to drink. Oddly she only had one person at the bar to wait on. Placing our orders while we got our drinks our food came in a timely manner. Though the food was awful. My sizzling salad was cold, no salad dressing at all, brown pieces of lettuce and the portion size was small. Oddly one of my guest who had a greek salad had no dressing on her salad either. Trying to track the bartender down was impossible as she got busy. We asked another waitress to bring us dressing which she did right away. That's when the bartender came to check on us. I did tell her this chicken was cold. I order this chicken at least once a week either at a location or to go so I know something is wrong. Then no dressing? She apologized and offered to make another salad. She said the chef is new.  Because I don't throw food away I declined the offer and could not afford to wait any longer.  I then paid my tab and left. None of us were happy and all of us felt this was not the typical food or service for  Ptia Jungle. I am not in a rush to come back but if I do I will make sure I tell them to serve the chicken hot and please add the dressing.
