Holy cow these guys are more than great!!\n\nSo I have tried literally four different garage door company's in the past. I always seem to run into some kind of bad luck with these company's either they rip me off, do a half ass job, or just flat out not good at anything they do... Well maybe fith time is a charm... I was referred to Smokeys Garage Door repair, and I would just like to start off by thanking them for being patient with me!\n\nThese guys are truly amazing! They are too notch experts when it comes to repairing\/ replacing garage doors. Just buy how knowledgable they came off gave my comfort and satisfaction that I was in not just good but great hands!\n\nThey were in and out with a job that would have taken any other competitor hours. Wow!! Still can't get over how professional they were with me through the whole process..\n\nThank you so much again Smokeys! I really love my new 8355 belt drive lift master!
