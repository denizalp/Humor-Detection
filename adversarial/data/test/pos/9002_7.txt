I recently stayed here for the first time. It was my fourth time in Vegas but my first time staying at a \"nice\" hotel and not for work purposes. I must say that the service here is excellent - from check in, to security, to the gym, restaurants and TAO nightclub. From start to finish we were treated like royalty! The concept of \"you get what you pay for\" certainly applies in Vegas.\n\nThe room was beautiful, with a large king bed and a slightly lower suite area with a pull out couch. I would have liked a fridge - minibars are not fridges, apparently, so I'm glad we were warned not to touch them (or be charged). The bathroom was nice and very spacious, but I wasn't a fan of the see-through shower. Considering there are two sinks, a makeup vanity, and a toilet, you would expect some privacy for someone to take a shower while someone is getting ready or using the other amenities. Oh well. \n\nOur view was decent - we could see a parking structure (not great) but also the LINQ's High Roller (great) so that was cool. Also, considering the level of noise in the hallway, it wasn't too loud at night. I slept great!\n\nMy one serious complaint is the way the hotels and elevators are laid out. Just to get out of the hotel (to the lobby or to the car), we had to walk through multiple hallways, take multiple elevators, and walk through more hallways. I've never in my life had to go down an elevator, walk through down a long twisty hallway, then go down another elevator, walk a few feet, then go back up ANOTHER elevator just to get to a parking garage. BIZARRE. I can only liken this layout to the ever-evolving, ever-changing stairs of Hogwarts castle in Harry Potter. You never really know where you are going or where they are taking you. It took me two solid days to figure out what the heck was going on. Oh well.\n\nHarry Potter stairs aside, I would come here again for the fantastic service and recommend it to someone looking for a unique and elegant hotel on the strip.
