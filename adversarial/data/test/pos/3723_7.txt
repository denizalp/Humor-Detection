I would never recommend anyone to this place.\n\nB & B is the worst restaurant in Venetian & palazzo.\nWe ordered spaghetti with lobster. Noodles tasted old and crunchy. Beet salad with persimmon was ok, but skin wasn't peeled.   Manager was awful, arguing with us that the spaghetti noodles are handmade every morning at 5 am and cooked for 8 minutes. The noodle we had wasn't freshly made because it was crunchy inside.
