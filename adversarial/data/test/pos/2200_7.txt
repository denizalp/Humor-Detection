The men of OGs... *sigh*.  I can't imagine visiting Vegas without making a pit stop here for at least 2 hours.  I thought I was gonna cry last weekend after taking a peek into my clutch and realizing I left my ATM card at the hotel.  Looking back, it really was a blessing.  This place brings out the devil in me.
