I decided to drop in and order something....BOY WAS I QUICKLY DISAPPOINTED!!! \"I'd like to order some macaroni and\"....\"WE OUT OF MACARONI\"!!! \"Ok....Well let me get some bbq chick\".....\"WE OUTTA CHICKEN\" \"Oooookkkkk\"....\"Can a brutha get a mint and two straws\"? \"WE OUTTA STRAWS AND DON'T SERVE MINTS AND IF WE DID, WE'D BE OUTTA THEM AS WELL\"!!!
