If owning a restaurant was just about the food, this place would get 4 or 5 stars. However, there are two problems with this particular restaurant. First, it's pricey compared to similar Mexican restaurant counterparts (Chipotle, Pacheros, etc.).\n\nMost importantly was our experience there on several nights (weekdays and weekends). My family is vegetarian, and we usually ask employees to simply change out their gloves when they're making our food (a normal request). We know that a lot of places aren't 100% vegetarian friendly, part of the nature of cooking and serving meat anywhere. But changing gloves is good enough for us to feel comfortable eating at a restaurant. Places like Fired Pie (Ray and 101) do this happily with a smile on their face. \n\nHowever, the employee putting together our meals here was a middle-aged man whose attitude upon hearing this request was unacceptable. He rolled his eyes, made a big fuss about it, muttered to himself and his coworkers in Spanish, and went to go wash his hands (all we asked is that he change his gloves). If this happened only once, I would chalk it up to a bad day. However, he has done three times.\n\nWe spoke to the manager at the time, who said that she doesn't work nights so she isn't aware of his issues. She said she would talk to him, but neither she nor the employee offered an apology at any point. In this day and age, to be treated with disrespect just because you're vegetarian is unacceptable and offensive. Generally I'm a pretty mellow person and I don't make a big fuss about things, but it seems like this place has an issue with customer service and attitude.\n\nSo if you're a strict-ish vegetarian, either avoid this place or stomach the attitude and disrespect you're going to get with your food. Or just don't go at night (which is when the guy works apparently).\n\nFor what it's worth, the enchiladas were really good (with black beans and cheese for filling).
