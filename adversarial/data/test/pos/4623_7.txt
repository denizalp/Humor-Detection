I came here to visit my boyfriend's uncle since he was DJing for the night. We took an uber from the strip, which cost about $25, and stayed for about 20 minutes. It is a little lounge with a bowling alley, pool table area, small wrestling ring, bar in the middle, and same arcade games. Kind of reminded me of an old school bowling alley you would find in your home town. The vibe was pretty dead for a Saturday night but I can understand since it is more known to the locals rather than tourists.
