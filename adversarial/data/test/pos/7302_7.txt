There are things about Mazie's that I just love. Like the sandwiches, expecially the turkado... It is exactly what it sounds like and delish. The breakfast burrito is amazing and covered in gravy. The benedict plates are okay. The hollandaise isn't my favourite and the eggs aren't poached... sad face. But so far... Everything else I have had there has been pretty amazing. Breakfast pizza has an egg on it... EGG! (If you like your eggs runny, order them sunny side up. The over easy eggs were overcooked) Also I love the sweet potato fries here. My favourite! \n\nThe wait staff is always super friendly. Always quick to pick up plates and refill glasses. I love the ambiance. Lovely little signage hanging on the wine rack: Wine a little, you'll feel better. Thought that was really rad. \n\nThere's not much else I can say about Mazie's that hasn't been said. Cool place to grab brunch or watch some football at the bar.
