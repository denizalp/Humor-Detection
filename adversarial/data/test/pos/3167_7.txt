Had an awesome time here at breakfast.\n\nIts an old school diner.  Juke boxes at the table and everything!\n\nWe got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and hash browns.  It was only $3.99!  I got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee.  The heath bar shake was awesome!  They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container.  So its like 2 shakes in one.  It was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but I wasn't complaining......I love heath bars!  \n\nThe service was awesome and our waiter was really nice!  Cool vibe, good food and low prices make this one of the best diners I have ever been in!
