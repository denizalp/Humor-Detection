While soulless & culturally exploitative restaurant chains are not exactly my cup of tea, every now and then you gotta just bite the bullet, drop your morals and binge on some unlimited breadsticks and Alfredo.\n\nMy trip to this particular franchise in North Olmsted began as every great dinner night out does- hot-boxing the rental car. After sitting in the sweet fog of that devils lettuce for a few minutes, the girls and I headed in.\n\nFirst course- appetizer sampler with calamari, mozzarella, and zucchini. I recommend all but the zucchini. Too hot and I burned the roof of my mouth, and also they kinda sucked.\n\nBut since you are all hard-working and conformist Americans, I'm sure that you have a classic Olive Garden order. This is not something that you need my advice on. However, what I can tell you about this particular franchise is that my waitress was the most caring, interesting, and lovely woman I have ever encountered at an Olive Garden. The restaurant had so many twists and turns I got lost on the way to the bathroom, yet I would do it again in a minute.\n\nIf you're ever in North Olmsted, I highly recommend this as your choice for an overpriced chain run by a huge, vile corporation.
