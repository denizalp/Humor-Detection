I went here for the first time on a Thursday. Word to the Wise: Dinner starts at 530! So after waiting for a little we were then greeted with beautiful aromas and the decor was alright. The food was very flavorful and good portions! I had the chicken vindaloo and my only complaint would be there was only one potato in my vindaloo, I wanted more! Other then that fantastic place and I will be back shortly!
