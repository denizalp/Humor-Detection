It seemed like we were the only people in the whole building. This place actually looks really cool from the outside. \n\nThe rooms are medium sized. The king bed was so comfy though - fit us three girls just fine. We had six blankets. It was freakin hot though. I kept kicking off the covers all night.\n\nThe building itself is dead quiet. It has an interesting  triangular layout and multi levels. It was pretty cool. I wouldn't mind exploring at night and hopefully meeting a hot guy \n\nBut I'm quite unlucky in the \"love at first sight\" department so I'll probably run into a rapist.
