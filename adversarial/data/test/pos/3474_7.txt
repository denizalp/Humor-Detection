I see polar opposites on these reviews. Some basing it solely on the customer service not taking into account the product or service that is being sold. I give 4 stars because although the first agent was super slow, the one who came in after him helped out fast. She noticed I reserved a car for the wrong day but she made an accommodation for pretty much the same price. Only negative is the $250 hold if use credit or $350 for debit. That's a bit excessive but it might be standard. I'm not sure. I only had debit with me this time so I definitely felt it.  driving off the lot was super easy with very little to do besides drive the car off.
