After going to 2 other restaurants (they were closed), we stumbled upon this place because it was still open at 1am. We walked into the Rum Runner, and the man at the bar directed us to the Badger Cafe. Upon walking into the cafe, we almost slipped because the floor seemed to be oily. Not in just one area, but it seemed the entire floor was oily. The seats were also noticeably dirty, but we just decided to stay and try the food.\n\nI had the tuna melt and my friend customized a burger. The tuna melt was okay. My friend said her burger was good, but when she got the check, it came out more than what she expected. The menu advertised that the burger was about $6 and gave a checklist of any additions you wanted, with no prices next to it- so it was very misleading. On a brighter note, the breaded fries were BOMB.COM and our server was super sweet, but I don't think I'd do a second take.
