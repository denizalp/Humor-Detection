I've been to the National on 10th several times but let's shove aside all the playthings. You know what I'm referring to, the bowling alley, ping pong tables, short skirts...these are things boys fiddle and diddle with.\n\nDaddies (and Ladies) it's time we talk about the Bourbon Room.\n\nThe first time I ever heard of this place was when I followed the legendary Wendy up from a CIA party. I huddled behind her like a scared puppy wondering what this dark room was. At the time there was some private function and everyone was dressed in bacon.\n\nBut the second time I came back as a man, if not a man, at least a well prepared individual. I skipped the trouble of being turned around by making a reservation, which was an effortless and engaging experience. Kudos to Stephen and the social media\/twitter folks of the National for booking us a spot.\n\nThe bourbon room is great. Actually, it's BEYOND great. If one manages to book a spot here on a weekend night, it's perfect for casually hopping out of your ferrari or newly washed car and being let in at the door because your name is on the list. Then there's the feeling of slicing through the near-drunk and sweaty crowd and letting them eye you in envy as you make your way up to the secret room they couldn't seem to get into.\n\nAt the bourbon room it's all about the bourbon. Their menu boasts an extensive list of bourbons even an expert (or at least one who thought they've seen enough youtube videos to believe they were) sit in awe. But we weren't bourbon experts, personally I prefferred Tequila, while my hombre-from-another-madre liked his peaty scotches. But our waitress, Fern, was very sweet, she visited us frequently through the night and was excited to make recommendations based on our general preferences with spirits. I preferred sweeter finishes so she boldly brought me a few suggestions that I really enjoyed. Afterwards, they were kind enough to write down what I had on a card.\n\nAlso ending review by saying how National makes amazing lobster poutine. LOBSTER POUTINE. And scotch eggs. Now shuttup and fight me like a man.
