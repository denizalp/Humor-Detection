I love that Tempe Marketplace is here - it's so convenient to have all of these stores so close to me. The movie theater is brilliant and the list of stores and restaurants is wonderful. It's also in a beautiful area that will only become more beautiful as time goes on. To walk around this mall is also pleasant as it is open and clean and well laid out. Parking isn't the best, but it's not the worst either.\n\nSo what's wrong? Well, all of the stores are shitty versions of those stores. The Target here sucks... they don't carry jack shit. Same goes for The Buckle - huge store, carries nothing. Go to the location in Chandler mall and see what I mean. Same goes for Best Buy and the rest of the stores in this place... all carrying just a small percentage of what these stores normally carry.\n\nI'm hopeful that the stores will start carrying their full stock like their other stores do, but until then - this place just barely earns 3 stars.
