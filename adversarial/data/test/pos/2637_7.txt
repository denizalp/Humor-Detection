About a year ago my husband came to me and said he wants to go back to church and he hoped I would come too. He was raised in the Catholic Church and retains some of their practices and beliefs. My experience with church was being molested by church worker when I was very young. Then as an adult I thought I would give it another shot. Only to be told that if I couldn't tithe the full 10% then I was \"taking the spot of someone who could truly contribute\". And that if I was a true believer in God then I would know He would magically bring that money back to me. I've always believed in God and never lost faith. So when my hubby asked, I went looking. WOW! Is all I can say. EVERY church I could find were saying THIS is what we believe and think and do. If you want to come here then you MUST DO EXACTLY WHAT WE DO. It just wasn't the loving, spiritual, excepting version of God that I have known in my heart forever. Then I found Unity. They said, We except all people and all paths to God. Really? ALL people? ALL paths? Let's just see about that! Our very first Sunday service, we were both in tears! It felt more like a family reunion. We were surrounded by all these happy smiling people. They all said hi, and good morning. We LOVE the quiet meditation time in the beginning. And the music, the songs, they were beautiful and loving. They put the lyrics on the screens so you can sing along..even if you're new! Then Rev. Richard spoke. We knew we were home. There is a reason every person gives a 5 star review. You will feel and be loved here. I pray you come to just one service. Just try it! If you don't like it, you can leave. But I have a feeling if you walk through these doors, you will find yourself walking through them again..and again...and again! My husband is a handsome Hispanic man in a wheelchair, you can't miss him. I'll be the one right by his side! My name is Jen. Come say hi so I can say, \"I told you so!\" Haha!!!
