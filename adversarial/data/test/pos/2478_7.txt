By far the worst experience I have ever had at a hookah bar. We walked in and the guy at the cash register was an absolute jerk from the get to. He kept trying to rush us into selecting a flavor of tobacco. I have no idea why, because we were the only people there and its not like he could possibly be busy to begin with.\n\nI chose the \"G Spot\" flavor and we sat down. When they brought us our hookah, I was shocked....one coal. Anyone who has any idea what they're doing with a hookah knows you're supposed to put two coals on a hookah. The hookah was not hitting at all so we asked for another coal. I politely asked \"Can we please get another coal?\". He rudely replied \"No. $1.\" First off, what the hell kind of hookah bar charges PER coal? Second of all, a dollar? Really? A whole dollar for ONE coal? Ridiculous. \n\nOf course, our hookah became extremely harsh but not ONCE did the guy come and check on us, regardless of the fact that we were the ONLY people in that place. \n\nIt was as bad an experience as someone can possibly have in a hookah bar, and there is NO doubt in my mind that this place will go out of business very very soon.
