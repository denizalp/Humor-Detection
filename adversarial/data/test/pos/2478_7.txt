Excellent food with friendly staff and cozy environment. \n\nOrdered the steak and eggs, it came with a generous portion of fruits and patoatoes.\n\nSteak was very rare just like i like it, beans tasted homemade, many coffee refills...What can i say, i left the place full and everything was good, including the company :)
