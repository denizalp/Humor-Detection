If you have a child under 6 years old go to Defy Gravity. This place (Skyzone) is awful for them. The foam pit is connected to the trampoline. There are no plain foam pits. You can't jump with your child because they separate you by age. You have to wear socks where as there is an option at Defy Gravity. You wear a sticker on your shirt which my child didn't like. Everyone (even people not jumping) stands on the path way and it's not an open floor plan so they are in the way when you have to walk through to go to the other areas. Defy Gravity is definitely a better place. We only went here because they were open on Sunday but they aren't worth the trouble.
