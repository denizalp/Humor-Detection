Welcome to the dog house! Literally!\n\nI was surprised that they have a pretty big menu considering it's a hot dog place. They have burgers, fries, and desserts too. The atmosphere is really cool, (definitely better than the Johnny Rockets that was there before). They have alcohol and happy hour with beer and food on the menu. They're open late. And in central Vegas. \n\nI got the slider dog and corn dog and some fries. Then slider dog had cheese and bacon (YUM). The chocolate shake was also to die for (drizzled with chocolate sauce). They have very friendly service and greet you upon entry and acknowledge you when you're leaving. I'm definitely going to come back to try the rest of their menu. It's worth coming to, trust me!\n\nOh, and FREE wifi!
