Yeah, whoever told me Tim Hortons is better than Dunkin Donuts was clearly speaking with their national pride more than their taste buds. \n\nLet's skip the part where the woman working really wasn't very friendly or effective at being helpful...\n\nThe coffee was just okay and the donuts were flat out bland. How the heck do you make a bland donut? It wasn't enough of any flavor. The strawberry-filled didn't have enough filling. The powdery exterior had little taste. I also tried a maple frosted ... and ignore the fact she packed it so 30% of the frosting stuck to the inside of the bag ... it just didn't taste like much. Not sweet enough or flavorful enough. Just not enough of a real donut.\n\nI even gave another location a try the next day... same thing. \n\nSo give me DD, or better yet, a local donut shop or bakery. Give me Starbucks or a local coffee shop. Tim is dropping the ball.
