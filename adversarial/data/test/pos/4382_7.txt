Granted this was after the club let out, but we were one of 5 only tables at the restaurant and the service was excruciatingly slow. Again, this could have been a mirage (ha-see what I did there?) because we were so tired. If you look at their sandwich boards, they have a late night happy hour, I believe it's 12 am - 3 am (call or stop by and ask!).\n\nIt's $5 appetizers and $5 cocktails\/well drinks. We ordered the dry rub and BBQ chicken wings. Not wanting to be out in the public any longer, we asked if we could get it to go. All in all everything took about 30 min. The wings were really good, and actually a good deal considering there were about 6 wings in each order for $5. The meat was moist and skin was crispy. I didn't think I'd care for the dry rub, but it's got a sweet, hickory, smokey taste that is really well put together.\n\nThe staff are courteous, it's a very cute setup with mason jars used as water glasses, and a very country, relaxed vibe.\n\nOn another night, we decided to get a burger, this was around 1 am. This time we called ahead and was told that it would be ready in 15 min. When we arrived to pick up our order at the bar as instructed, there was no bartender and no staff. We flagged down a server who appeared to just be standing around and let them know we were picking up a call ahead order. Instead of hunting down a bartender\/server, he just told us to wait by the bar and someone should be able to help us and continued to stand in place.\n\nThe Backyard Burger ($17) was solid, not phenomenal. Just a burger on a potato bun, with lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, and onions. We ordered it with fries and to our dismay when we went to our room, they included two ketchup packets. So we had to head back down for more.\n\nWe also asked them to charge it to our room on the phone and were asked to produce a credit card upon pick-up.\n\nI believe this operation is new, maybe opened around September 2014, so it could explain the scatterbrained service. It's a nice option to have being that's it's open 24 hours.
