If eating clean is what you're searching for, living kitchen serves it up daily from smoothies, fresh made to order drinks, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, etc.  They pretty much do it all and they will definitely have something you will like, even if at first glance you may not think so.  I stopped by after shopping at a few stores nearby and ordered 2 items, saving the second for later.  The living burrito(sunflower seed refried beans, cauliflower rice, pico, guac, sprouts, cashew sour cream, wrapped with a collard leaf) and the curry bowl(lentils, quinoa, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, tomatoes)  and to drink I tried the gingerale(fresh ginger juice, lemonade, sparkling water, coconut nectar).  \n\nKeep in mind the meals are made to order so it may take some time depending on what you order.  The living burrito was not my favorite so I probably wouldn't order that again but the curry bowl was pretty amazing and definitely will require repeated visits when in the area. The portions are pretty huge so bring your appetite or save some for later.  The gingerale was pretty good, very refreshing and flavorful as well.
