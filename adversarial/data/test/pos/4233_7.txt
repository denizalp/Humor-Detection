They do NOT take Groupons. I repeat, they Do NOT take Groupons. And they make it perfectly clear when you walk in the door. This already threw me off. \n\nThis place is around the corner from my house and we saw a Groupon for it so we wanted to try it out. The waitress also wanted to make it clear that they do not take Groupons. We ended up staying for their happy hour. We got a 10 inch pizza with mushrooms, green peppers, sausage and bacon. I've never had a Chicago style deep dish pizza before. I'm sorry, but never again. They went way overboard with the sauce. We also ordered some mild wings that they said were the best wings ever. I thought they were a bit spicy for mild. \n\nThe only upside was the beer was very reasonably priced for happy hour. Good service, but I won't be back. You guys are called Rosatis yet u don't accept Rosatis Groupons.
