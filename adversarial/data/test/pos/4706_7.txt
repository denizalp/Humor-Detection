After going to the other three nightclubs at the Palms Towers, we ended our night at The Ghost Bar. We hadn't read up on this place so we weren't expecting the bar's spellbinding view of Las Vegas' evening skyline!\n\nThe music was decent, they played a nice blend of Hip-Hop and House\/Trance. It wasn't overly crowded and had a lot of areas to sit down, as well as open dance floors. \n\nBy far, the best feature of this bar is the rooftop terrace that overlooks the Vegas city lights. There's an area on the terrace that has a clear pane where you can see 55 stories down, yikes! I actually made friends with a guy that was trying to convince me to step on the pane, since I was too scared, by jumping up and down on it (what the hell?) haha! \n\nWe spent the remainder of our night drinking and partying under the stars, literally. The Ghost Bar is a \"must-go\", haha.
