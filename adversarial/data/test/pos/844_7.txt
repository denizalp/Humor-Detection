We were heading to trivia when the boyfriend remembered Carmella's has a wing special on Wednesdays... Well, it's basically .50 a wing, so it's not that special, but it's decent... \n\nWhen you go to Carmella's, you walk in and the cash register is directly in front of you... You order and pay for your food and then you can seat yourself where you like... I went in, ordered 10 wings and 2 beers, paid and went to grab a seat... After about 10 minutes, I went back to the register because our beers still hadn't come out yet... Apparently, the bartender opened them and just left them sitting on the counter instead of bringing them out to us... Okay... After another 30 minutes with no wings, we ended up having to leave because we were on our way to another place... I went back up to the register to get a refund for the wings because we clearly were not going to have time to eat them... None of the employees knew how to do a refund to a credit card... They finally find the guy that knows how to do the refunds, so it gets started... After a couple minutes, I offered to just take cash back because it was my debit card, but they just acted like they didn't hear me... Maybe they didn't... Not only that, when I asked for the refund, no one asked why or even apologized for their shoddy service... They basically acted like I wasn't really standing there until she had me sign the receipt for the refund...  They refunded the money for the beers, too, but I don't think that was an attempt to be courteous, I think they probably couldn't figure it out and didn't care enough to try... That's it... I'm over Carmella's... At least this location...
