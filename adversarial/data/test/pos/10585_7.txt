What can I say... I came to VEGAS to gamble and boy did I lose by taking my chances here.  2 lines for certain meats. Then another line to pay for over priced tacos. \nThe paper the tacos are wrapped in had more flavor than the meat itself. I've been to TJ and let me tell you there is no comparison. I can see why the locals gave this place five's . We drove around I did not see any other Mexican taco stands so I can see why the locals favor this place. What's with the guacamole it's so watery and the salsa had no flavor and the meat was cold and flavorless. Or maybe it's me being from LA we are spoiled with the variety of different Mexican taco stands. If you still decide to stop by and eat you've been warned good luck. \nNo es bueno...
