This relatively new location of Bite Bar is located in the Path and professes to bring you desserts \"without the guilt\".  It remains to be seen if bite-size cupcakes are as popular up North as they are in New York (cf. Baked by Melissa).\n\nBite Bar looks like a compartment in a space ship, modern even if not inviting and cozy.  Besides the cupcakes, Bite Bar also makes macarons, tarts and marshmallow bars.  My favorite is the Just Bite Me! cupcake, that is vanilla stuffed with raspberry puree.  The cookies n' cream cupcake is a light chocolate cake topped with cookie crumble.  The list goes on, with a dozen choices, of which I have tried most.\n\nI am not convinced that someone with a real yearning for dessert would settle for bite-sized treats.  There is a certain satisfaction that only comes from a generous helping, rather than multiple bites, of your favorite pastry.  A clear case of 1 + 1 falling well short of 2.
