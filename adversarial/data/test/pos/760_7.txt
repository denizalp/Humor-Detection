If you're looking for a new nail salon I highly recommend that you do NOT go to this place. I had SNS done and it didn't even last two days before it chipped. When I called to make an appointment to get my nails fixed, the front desk lady was nice but the second I got to the salon her eyes were glued to her cell phone. I was the one that said hello first and she was very rude. I finally go sit down and wait to be taken back and I can just tell that the lady in the front was telling all the technicians about my nails and they were all staring me down and speaking Vietnamese and laughing while looking directly at me. I didn't say anything then finally the girl that did my nails the first time around took me back to fix my nails and was being extremely rude. She then was talking badly about my nails in Vietnamese to the other techs and two of them even walked over and looked at my nails and looked at me with judgment and shook their heads and they all started talking to one another in their language while looking at my nails at the same time. I felt so uncomfortable that I just got up and walked out. I didn't even last 5 minutes in the chair with lily (the tech) because of how uncomfortable I felt. Hold on it gets worse people..... as I'm walking out I caught the lady at the front desk talking badly about me and my nails to another tech and in front of another customer!!!!!!! I was extremely hurt and disappointed. Is that really how you treat the people that support your business. Without us customers this salon wouldn't be anything and the employees wouldn't be making money so isn't it common sense to treat your customers with respect and make them feel comfortable? Another thing is that the SNS color change costed me $49.... THAT DOESNT EVEN INCLUDE A MANICURE WITH IT!!!! Listen I'm not cheap I wouldn't mind it if it lasted me the three weeks as promised but it only lasted two days. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. \n\nList of reasons why I don't recommend this salon:\nBad service \nProduct isn't good\/very cheap product \nRude employees \nMaking fun of their customers \nSpeaking too much in their language \nMaking you feel uncomfortable \nOverpriced \n\nALL IN ALL JUST TERRIBLE!!!! I highly suggest you don't even give this place a try.
