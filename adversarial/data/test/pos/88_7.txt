This place was like an Ed Hardy shirt: pretentious, too small, and clearly made for someone else.\n\nI admit, this COULD be a place people like, but as someone who goes to Vegas to play some table games and relax, it wasn't me.  \n\nI booked SLS because I had received a free room promotion from them.  I don't recall which tower I was in except that it was not the Lux tower.  Our room was way too small for two people and the bathroom set up, while stylish, was awkward and gave virtually no privacy.  The clunky light up bed frame and couch were cool to look at when we walked in, but took up so much space!  Further, the shower had some random hairs on the wall and the toilet room had... something... on the wall.  The room felt claustrophobic and not very clean.\n\nThe soap and shampoo was nice, but there was no ice bucket or ice machine and we didn't even think about touching that minibar- which took up even more space.  Further, their clever labels on the snacks were peeling off and looked as tacky as the random masking tape on the wall next to the fire sprinkler.\n\nBeyond the room, signage in the parking garage was poor.  We entered at what seemed to be the main entrance and ended up on a stage where a band was playing with all of our luggage.  We wandered the casino floor and could not find a sign that said \"registration.\"  After asking a table dealer, we arrive to the registration line with only two people taking care of a long line of people.\n\nThe whole place seemed geared for a first impression, but at the cost of being practical. \n\nThe staff was a bit aloof as well.  The guy who checked us in talked quietly and quickly, the CODE desk guy made awkward small talk.  he asked what I thought of my room and when I told him, the conversation ended.\n\nOne late morning, I was walking by a the main pool where a hotel guest was asking about what the deal was and the guard said condescendingly, \"Well, you could go to the kiddie pool.\"\n\nThe casino wasn't very big, which is normally a good thing to me, but it felt limited.   There isn't much in walking distance as an alternative either.  Also, it was so very cold down there.\n\nThere was a pool concert one night and we arrived back around 11.  We drove all of the way to the top of the structure and found the last spot.\n\nThis is probably a good place for a group of young friends who want to feel like they're doing something stylish and hip and will not be in a mind to notice that there isn't much behind the style.\n\nAfter our first night, we debated switching hotels, but it was free and we would be out all day, so we decided not to.
