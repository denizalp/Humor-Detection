It's sad to hear it's closing -- it was always good for a cheap place to crash (if you could deal with the fact that a turning on a blacklight in any of the rooms would immediately blind you with a bevy of various dried fluids on just about every part of the room -- which most of us in Vegas had come to terms with, since the same can be said of most of the city).\n\nR.I.P., Stardust.
