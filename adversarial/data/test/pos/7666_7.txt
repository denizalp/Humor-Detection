Blue Ribbon's loss has been everyone else's gain when Zuma came through the doors of Cosmopolitan earlier this year.  The quality of ingredients and menus are pretty equal, but the sexy ambience and d√©cor are what take it up a level for an improved dining experience.   Four visits in the past year with two of them being special occasions (Valentine's and my wife's choice for her birthday) make it obvious I enjoy being there.\n\n\"Lobster No Oven Yaki\", roasted lobster with shizo-ponzu butter, is presented beautifully and tastes spectacular.   I dug into the head of the lobster face first for that money flavor both times we had this, felt no shame whatsoever, and actually feel bad for people who don't do it.  \n\nAnother eye-rollingly good dish is the \"Yaki Taraba Gani\".  The simple menu description of \"King Crab with Ponzu Lime Butter\" really should add something like \"Whitney Houston Crack\" or \"Fuck money, eat this\" because it's awesome.  You're really only looking at maybe 5 or 6 bites at best and that last piece is definitely worth fighting for.  I'd suggest rock\/paper\/scissors, but a stun gun works too. \n\nAnd the mustX1000 order for the table is always the \"Salmon and Tuna Tartare\".  That amazing box of such glorious fish is something I cannot get enough of.  It comes with chips for scooping, but I feel like they get in the way of my enjoyment.  Get a spoon and dive in!  \n\nThe biggest issues have been with the timing of the food.  With multiple kitchens going (robata, sushi, etc), I could see how it wouldn't be easy for a server to manage.   We've had side dishes come out 10- 15 minutes ahead of entrees, hot dishes come out before starters, and all it did was clutter the table with stuff we weren't ready for.  I'd advise ordering by round while enjoying their great cocktail list between.  Aside from that, I am ready to Zuma-zoom-zoom back here whenever.
