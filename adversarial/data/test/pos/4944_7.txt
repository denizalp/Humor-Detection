The tea selection is awesome and by the far, I think, the best corporate-owned alternative to Starbucks when it comes to tea. I still prefer local. \n\nThe staff know their tea and the buying experience here is awesome. The tea leaves are loose. In lay man's term, it's not Lipton or Nestea. Still not getting it? It's not in a tea bag. \n\nThey have wide selection of tea kits for those who want to be like queens and have a tea party. Not that kind of tea party.\n\nYou can't party here. The place is small. And hot in the summer. But hey it's tea. \n\nCome and enjoy.
