Came here last night to get a pizza to go. Since it was Ash Wednesday no meat.   We got a Medium size pizza, The Siciliana with Basil, It was as always fantastic!!   THe Pizza here is so good and the restuarant smells so good as well.  We also got Salad. This Place never disappoints. We love it. You will find it nesteled in a little shopping center. Look for the Circle K.  They even have a wood burning fire Pizza Oven. Again we love it!
