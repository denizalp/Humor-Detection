This place gathers a whole other type of crowd to please for cheap eats . It's dirty and dingy not good food. It's a cheap buffet at best. I can't seem to find myself even touching the door handle let alone the countless times the serving utensils have been touched with kids who wipe  noses on their shirt sleeves. ..ugh!
