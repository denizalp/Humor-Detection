Honestly, this place is an okay place for me. One extra star is for their wine. $45 for a bottle is like their cheapest, not cheap, but pretty good. I really like the sauvignon blanc from California. So I have to say their wine selection is quite great.\n\nAbout the food, I think it was a bit over-priced, which apply to majority of Vegas restaurants on the strip. I had a sea bass because they did not have the scallop. It was not a small piece, but the presentation was quite disappointing. It tasted good, but not amazing, a tiny bit over cooked in my opinion. But very mildly. My friend had fried chicken and seafood platter, they might taste good, but again there was no presentation at all!!  So I really feel their food was just alright. \n\nInside was not quite big, and there is wait if you don't have a reservation in the evening, even on weekdays. So it is definitely one of the popular ones in Caesars Palace.
