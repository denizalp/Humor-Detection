TIME OUT!\n\nI smelled like pork, I felt porky and I don't think I would be eating pork for awhile...\n\nWhen I stepped inside Jang Won, I didn't know I am here for AYCE Korean BBQ. But when I saw every single table were having BBQ.......\n\nYou have a choice of \n\nSam Gyup Sal (Pork Belly) - $14.99\n\nBulgogki - $14.99\n\nMok Sam Gyup Sal (Pork Butt) - $14.99\n\nSo Sam Gyup Sal (Beef Belly) - $17.99\n\nWe ended up having Pork Belly and Pork Butt. The cut is definitely quite fatty as I was kind of full and in a pork coma after the first round.\n\nThe AYCE is quite a good deal as it includes all the banchan, a soup and barley with rice.\n\nService here is excellent!! When I pressed that bell, some one really came to my table right away!! We were even asked if we want more meat without asking or waving anyone down! The owner even came over and asked us how our meal and walked us to the door!\n\nTip: if you have 4 people having AYCE, you would get a free bottle of Soju\n\nTip: There are other Korean food aside from BBQ, I think I going to have those instead\n\nTip: Lunch Special till 4 pm\n\nTip: Don't wear your good clothes, the ventilation here is not sufficient.. My phone still smells like pork after I wiped it down...\n\nI can now have a dream full of pork.. oink oink
