Best reverse happy hour in Tempe. 4 stars is only for the bar -- not the food as my liver was in charge that night. Chronic Tacos is one of those places where things can go downhill quickly - but all in fun and cheap drinks. The $3 rockstar\/vodkas were our poisons of choice. Busy, but not crowded Chronic at 9-ish was fun and likeable wih their comfortable black leather booths.\n\nOur happy hour last week that turned into a reverse happy hour resulting in free acrobatic entertainment by yours truly on the light rail. At Chronic Tacos, just remember: buyer beware.
