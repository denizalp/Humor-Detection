Family run diner-Good food -good service-fun & friendly atmosphere.\n\nWe ordered breakfast-I had the 12oz NY steak breakfast special,the wife had potato & onion pancakes with applesauce and the boy had biscuits & sausage gravy.\n\nLike having a home cooked meal.Only better-No cooking or dishes!!\n\nThe food was better than expected-the potato pancakes were \"to die for\" and the biscuits & gravy was fresh. The steak was charbroiled to perfection(medium rare). The coffee was strong & fresh.\n\nSOLID 4 stars!:)
