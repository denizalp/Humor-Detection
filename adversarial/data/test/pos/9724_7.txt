If you are or are not a MJ fan, you would love this show. Thank god my sister recommended this show. The show isn't about having a corny impersonator. The show is loaded with cool ticks and acrobats over his best hits. I found myself missing him. They do the Mike Jack memories in my head justice. Well worth it, if you are able to attend, attend.
