The drinks here are pretty good, and they had drink combinations not available at other bbt shops.\n\nI like the updated Japanese magazines.\n\nhowever the service here is horrible, especially if the place is packed! it's slow and inattentive.\n\ni was there with a friend, and they gave us this tiny table and fold out chairs, we almost fell sitting on them, twice! they said, will give us a real table when one clears up, however they just kept giving the tables to new customers and forgot about us... during the whole stay we were on temporary table and chairs?\n\nnever ever again returning and no one should be seated that way!
