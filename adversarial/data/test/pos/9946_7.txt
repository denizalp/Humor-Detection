Great spot for a party. The most amazing view of the strip. And because the location isn't blocked by other large casinos we actually had a nice breeze despite the 100 plus temperature. \n\nWe were there for an early Fourth of July celebration. Yellow Brick Road played while we enjoyed buckets of cold beer. About 9:00 was the amazing firework display. There is something to be said about not fighting the crowds and being able to just chill reclining on a lawn chair while watching the choreographed inferno above. Totally awesome!
