JackBeagles does quite a few things right. Easy watering hole for the NoDa walker in us all, and plenty of bar food to fill the bellies of those pounding copious amounts of brewskies or other unmentionable swill. \n\nGotta say I love the Rippers. I'm a fan of a hot dog just about any day of the week and JB's was right on the money. I like a little bit of char on my dog, a little white onion, relish and yellow mustard. However, \"ripped,\" means split and deep fried. What the eff?! Who knew hotdogs could be more awesome. \n\nPlenty of beer to choose from here. Love that they have a good variety of bottles, too. \n\nWhere I can't say this is my go-to spot for dinner or food in general when in NoDa, I really want to check out the brunch. With \"Shit on a Shingle,\" which I haven't had in years, these guys have piqued my interest for a future Sunday brunch spot.
