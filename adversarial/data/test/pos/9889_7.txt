I love the idea of this place. Everything is made in house! I had the Killer Chicken Burger and hubby had the Ace High Club Sandwich. Both were delicious. I found the Killer Chicken a bit salty to my taste but hubby says that's because of the bacon which was sharp. An acquired taste I'm told. Anyway our server Nat was very friendly and efficient. The decor is nice too. Casual but classy. The bathrooms looked like they need another coat of paint. They don't quite match the cool look of the rest of the place. But that's a small thing to nit pick about. My pet peeve about bathrooms is that they're either freezing cold or boiling hot. This one was just right. I would definitely come back here to try other dishes.
