I was skeptical about this place based on the previous 1 review only yelpers but I went for it. Is it the most authentic Mexican food I ever had? NO. Was it the best Mexican food is Las Vegas? NO. Would it serve a purpose after drinking at the bar it's located in? YES. I wish I could of enjoyed the food more. The server was very friendly and the prices were fantastic. Sadly it just wasn't great tasting food.
