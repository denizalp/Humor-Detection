Very poor quality they redid my extensions without washing my hair. Removed with Acetone and shoved in new ones same appt. Works from basement. Claimed to be high end and was ripped off. Hair starting falling out same day wanted money to be put back in and my head was so very itchy couldn't sleep. GO to a reputable real hair Salon with a Guarantee. And honest reviews.
