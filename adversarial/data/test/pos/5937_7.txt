I didn't really like tacos until I had gone to Tijuana. This place somewhat reminds me of Tijuana so obviously, I kind of liked it haha They have a pick three tacos for $10 thing. It comes with rice and beans. When you ask for more though they dont tell you thats its an extra charge - so keep that in mind! The only thing I get when I come here is the pescado tacos - it is so freaking good and comes with this red sauce on top that goes really well with the fish. Im not sure if they have taco tuesday - weve gone in a few times on a Tuesday and no one has told us of any specials. WHY NO TACO TUESDAY. This is all.
