Whoa!! Nice!! And right next to the ever popular Super G!\nThe decor is Spartan to non existent, but who cares because this place is all about the food. And it's really good! The staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The Pho with tenderloin and shrimp (aka Michael N combo pho) was delicious and the Vietnamese Beef Stew with carrots was \"get in a space ship and orbit the earth\" out of this world - so much flavor!! The usual toppings, sprouts, limes, jalapenos and cilantro - but wait -  what's this super spicy green thing?! Culantro!!\nWe now interrupt this review for a station break brought to you by Wikipedia - culantro (aka spiny coriander - aka Eryngrum foetidum, which the Latin translates to \"foul smelling thistle\") is a member of the cilantro family and used in some Vietnamese cooking.\nLet's just say culantro blew my mind and kicked my Pho in it's great big noodle butt. \nGreat place to have lunch if you're out at Super G, car shopping or if you just want to eat their awesome stew!!
