My review here is based solely on happy hour because I have never really been at any other time. This bar is really close to my work so we frequent it for the after work to wind down from time to time.\n\nI always have a really great time. I like the outdoor seating when the weather is nice, I like that they serve black beans on most of their items rather than refried, I like the cheap buckets of Pacifico during happy hour and I love that they have corn hole or bags or whatever other term people refer to it as. \n\nThe table service is always really great and the waitresses have always been friendly, I've never had a poor experience with the staff. Some of the people that go there are pretty big D Bags which is annoying, but since I'm usually with a group of co-workers, I really don't mind.\n\nAll in all, this isn't where I'd choose to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night, but I will definitely continue to stop in for happy hour on those days after work when I could really just use a drink!
