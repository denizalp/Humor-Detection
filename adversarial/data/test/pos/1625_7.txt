BUYER BEWARE! This is white trash central! I am currently writing this at 2am on a Thursday night, lying in my Cromwell bed feeling my pillow vibrate from the stupidly loud noise from the club that's in the hotel. My door must be paper thin because I can hear every word of the drunks' conversation as they pass in the halls. The decor is nice - but it feels as though the management decided they wanted a nightclub instead of a hotel at the last minute and the hotel patrons have to suffer for being dumb enough to book here.
