This place is an internet scam! The description from the ABVI site is misleading, avoid this place at all cost. Simply put, it looks like crack house, and it's not in a safe location. If your lucky you might see local meth addicts fighting crackheads.  And the hotel management is has level of scumminess  that is equally matched by the criminal patrons of this hotel.
