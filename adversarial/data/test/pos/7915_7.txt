If there was an option to give NEGATIVE STARS I would. This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had. Here's what happened \n\nWe show up to the restaurant with a party of 8. To our surprise we were sat immediately... Now we know why. We sat for about 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks. Another 20 minutes rolled by and we still didn't have service. I finally got up and approached a manager and asked if we had a waiter coming. He said \"I'm sure you do\" and turned around. Strike 1.\n\nOur waitress finally arrived. She said \"what does everyone want to order\" she took our orders and walked away. We didn't see her until she brought put food out 45 minutes later. Completely out of water she never attempted to refill. Strike 2\n\nWe ordered the 11.99 steak & lobster special, chicken fingers & fries, bacon Mac & cheese, and the rib sampler. My fries were actually as cold as the ranch. The best thing that was ordered was the Mac & Cheese. The steak & lobster were so rubbery it was unbearable to eat. Now we weren't expecting much for this price but I didn't know steak could possibly have this type of consistency. Strike 3\n\nWe were never asked how the food was, our waters & beers were never refilled &  even after seeing the majority of food still on all the plates our waitress never thought to ask if everything was ok. I'm not sure if they just thought we were tourists but we are actually locals and all in the service industry. And to top it off the gratuity was already added... Insanity. \n\nWhen we were leaving I expressed my disappointment to the manager & all he did was smile & say \"have a nice night\" And to top it off after expressing these feelings a few of the servers were laughing & highfived . \n\nI will have a nice night because I now have the knowledge to never return. \n\nPS I am a bartender downtown & will tell everyone I know to keep far as possible from this establishment.
