NEVER GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!\nI'd ask someone at GREAT CLIPS to do my hair before going here.\n\nI haven't had them do anything for me, but my mom's friend recommended the place.\n\nI had reservations FOR WEEKS with these people to get my hair done for senior prom. My boyfriend flew here to go to my prom and I wanted everything to go smoothly.\n\nI show up hours before prom at my scheduled time and the second I walked in they had a weird look on their face. My mom and boyfriend were with me.\n\nThey proceeded to tell me that the girl scheduled to do my hair decided to go on vacation. Then they said they called me and left me a message. Bullshit. I had Call ID and an answering machine that kept record of every message. They never called. So here I was...screwed. Right before prom, with a bad hair day. I said I didn't care WHO did my hair as long as someone did it nicely.\n\nThe girls running the front desk were 16 (they went to highschool with me). They had no clients. They had hairdressers playing with their coworkers' hair. And they had no time for me?\n\nRidiculous. I was so angry. I drove down the road to CIELO and begged for them to do an updo. They were packed and a bride and her bridal party were getting their hair done, so I wouldn't have felt bad being turned away (especially with no reservation). I got lucky and this nice girl took me into a room in the back and did my hair nicely and even gave me a discount, but I tipped her everything I had.\n\nDestination Spa blows. I wouldn't take my worst enemy there.
