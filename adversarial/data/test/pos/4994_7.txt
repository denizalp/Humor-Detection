My husband and I went to Imperial wholesale upon a recommendation to match up an older tile pattern, as they do have a good variety.  We worked with Stefanie,which knows design and tile and she was patient and kind as my husband and I agreed to disagree on a few choices.  That is where this companies quality and customer service ended! \nThe sub sent out mismeasured the amount of tile needed, his worker got a severe attitude after getting reprimanded for using my new in the box vanity as a workbench.His crew left my house dirty,left my water hose reel knocked over, the hose strung across 2 fences and water running. They didn't clean the grout fully off any of the tile. Now I am left with cleaning and sealing the job he left un finished and I constantly had to clean up after them.\nMoving on to installing the granite counters, I was severely misquoted by \"BigMike\" and when I questioned this I was told that  $69.00 a sqft is just what it cost to do 2 simple bathroom counters. I am taking this current bathroom, my next bathroom and  kitchen  elsewhere !!
