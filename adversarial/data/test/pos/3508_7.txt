This place just opened on Parc, and it already feels like home. It smells like fresh donuts and coffee, which is how I want every place to smell. The donuts are traditional Russian style, which makes them smaller and lighter than what you might be used to.  They are light and sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. They are made to order and fried in front of your eyes, which makes them super fresh. The coffee is fresh and supplied by 49th Parallel (a Vancouver-based roaster). I had a double-shot espresso with a thick crema and a sweet aftertaste, and I loved it. \n\nThe atmosphere in here is also really welcoming. Floor to ceiling windows, the shiny blue floors, and fresh white walls give this place tons of natural light. It's the perfect place to meet friends or read a book, and there is even a huge bookcase of take-one-leave-one books and board games for patrons to enjoy. Almost all of the tables were up-cycled and renovations done by Boris and Grant themselves, two of the smilest guys on the planet.\n\nCome in for a quick coffee and donut, or stay and make friends. Either way, you'll love Chez Boris and all of its delights.
