Up charge to add 10 cents worth of onions and the manager has no power to even override the chef's ego. \"He won't customize a salad when it's busy\" (PS it's half empty today). This place is a joke - even the Groupon for 40% off doesn't make it worth staying. We left on principal alone - they lost a $50 order over $0.10 of onions. Not to mention when the manager (Ian) said he would go back and talk with the chef he never returned. Ian is a wasted employee and the chef is full of himself - this is Sugar Factory, no Ã©.\n\nOh wait, just found out Ian is the graveyard manager, not even the top manager on duty. My mistake for trusting him. Manager Gary Swain came out and tried to convince us to stay with dinner on him. No thanks, at this point I'm sure the food would be spit on.
