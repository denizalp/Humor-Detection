So, I needed a pedicure-BADLY.  I've been here before right after I moved to this side of town, and I was lllloooonnnnnggg overdue for another pedicure like you wouldn't believe, so I came back!\n\nI like this place even though its not in a glamorous part of town.  It's located in a sad looking strip mall, but dang, these guys do good feet, I swear.  The first time I came here, I had a guy do my feet, and he took extra special care, and they came out looking awesome. I get really dry skin around my heels, and it gets painful at times, and he was so careful not to hurt me.  I swear, my feet stayed smooth for the longest time!\n\nWhen I came here today, I had a lady work on my feet, and even though she wasn't as gentle as the guy, she still did an awesome job.  The regular pedicure is $18, but for an extra $5, they will give you the whole schebang.  Hot towel on the legs, massage, extra scrubbing, the whole deal.  I know most places will do this, but I feel like they do such an exceptional job for the small price that they charge.  (I've heard of other places charging more for the same services. Why pay more?)\n\nThey also have a punch card deal, and after 7 punches you get a $10 gift certificate (which I will probably use towards another pedicure!)  When I come here, I never have to wait and I swear half the place is full of regulars.   AWESOME prices, great hours (even open on Sundays) and they even do manicures here too. Go check it out!
