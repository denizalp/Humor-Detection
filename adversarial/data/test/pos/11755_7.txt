This place struck me as an Olive Garden with trendier decor. Biaggi's is a chain restaurant that serves mediocre, Americanized Italian food. Our server said the special was whitefish milanese, which she pronounced \"mill-ahn-eez.\" No.\n\nI gave Biaggi's a shot because it's close to home -- I've driven by it but never tried it. We had bread, side salads, veggie risotto and eggplant parmesan. Here were a few comments during dinner:\n--\"I like the little goodies [cucumber\/red pepper] in the salad more than the actual salad.\"\n--\"I like your risotto you cooked at home more than this.\"\n--\"I have to cut my eggplant parmesan with a knife. I shouldn't have to do that.\"\n--\"I would come back here for the bread. Nothing else.\"\n--\"Let's not get dessert. We have some Mounds candy bars in the car from when we bought dog food at Mounds.\"\n\nNo, grazie.
