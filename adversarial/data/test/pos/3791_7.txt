Being a ridiculous lover of all things old, I know my way around the antique block. This place is pretty decent, especially when it comes to furniture, however I am getting pretty tired of people refinishing wooden tables with white spray paint and calling it \"shabby chic\". Because this location houses different merchants, each booth is different, so you really never know what might pop up.
