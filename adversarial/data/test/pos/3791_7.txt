Happy birthday to me! Possibly the best dining experience I've ever had.\n \nMy date had dined at FnB on more than one occasion and talked it up quite heavily. Between trusting his palate and the 5 star direction of Pavle Milic, I literally didn't have to make any decisions. None. Being the control freak that I normally am, I really enjoy when someone else takes over and just 'makes it happen' for me. It's sexy. This time was no different. I wouldn't have changed a thing.\n\nWe started off with a couple of perfectly crafted mint juleps and tasty marinated olives. I don't venture into mint julep territory very often but I'm glad we did. Light, refreshing and the perfect beginning to what would end up being over 2 hours of gastronomic sensory overload. \n\nThe menu is forever changing; one of the perks of using only seasonal\/local ingredients.The Braised leeks, mozzarella and over-medium egg is a little slice of heaven on a plate. Throwing an egg on almost anything will make my eyes light up. It's like bacon in that way...a no brainer. \n\nAs for the entree, I had the jidori chicken and spaetzle. Holy WOW! Had I not known that it was chicken I would have assumed it was some sort of exotic fowl that I shouldn't legally be eating or maybe even WANT to be eating except it's so damn tasty that I can't stop, so ya...\n\nThis was a first time spaetzle experience for my half German ass (sooo pathedic, I know) and it was superb. I have no comparison... but I am a dumpling fearing texture-phobe and let me just say there's nothing to be afraid of here. Insanely good! I did only have one bite of my guys lamb dish, though it too was excellent.\n\nI have a true soft spot in my heart for local wine and I've never seen a list composed entirely of such. Kudos FnB! \nI don't remember what we chose (see what happens when someone else does all the driving) but it pared perfectly with our meals.\n\nOne more thing.....don't ever let anyone tell you that lemon cake and butterscotch pudding don't go together. They do. Let them scoff. The only rule is that there aren't any.
