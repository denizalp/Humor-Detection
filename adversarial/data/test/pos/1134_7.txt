Horribly rude! Walked in with a party of 7 and waited to be sat and asked if we could sit and they looked at us with no response. . We began to clear a table of dish rags to sitting on the only large table they had to accommodate and no service. I told my family to get up because we were obviously not welcome for whatever reason. . They only a 1 table eating and it was empty so you would think they would want the business.  I said thanks for being so rude and no service and the 2 women in front refused to even look up when their other customers witnesses the whole thing. . I wish bad on Noone but I will be glad to see this business fail. . Good ridens!
