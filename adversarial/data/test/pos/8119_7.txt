Be aware: I was given a time slot of 8am - 12pm, but the person on the phone also told me the plumber gets in the office at 8am, debriefs, gathers his stuff, then goes to the first call. It would be about 930a, maybe 10am before they get to you if you're the first client. \nWhy even include 8a-930a in the time slot if the plumber is not going to make it? \n\nWaiting for the plumber to show up now... hopefully, they don't try to scam me. Should be an easy fix with the kitchen faucet.
