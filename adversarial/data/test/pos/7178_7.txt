Wow. Rarely does food quality piss me off this much, but I have to share this. \n\nToday I ate the WORST, most disgusting, piece of trash ever from Mickey's Pizza in Mississauga. \n\nWe ordered a WELL DONE, veggie pizza. \n\nWhat I received was a soggy, round flatbread with what I can only describe as cardboard tasting vegetables and sauce. The sauce was worse than presidents choice tomato sauce, and the vegetables were rubber. \n\nThis place was featured on a TV series, I have to ask; how much did the owners pay off the producers to be featured? No one could possibly eat this trash and say,\" wow let me tell the world!\"  \n\nYou guys need to close down immediately, take a 6 month trip to Italy; and learn. \n\nI am actually furious I ate a bite and put my body through that.
