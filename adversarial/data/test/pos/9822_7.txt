Took family here for breakfast as we headed out on a weekend trip. We had the chicken biscuits. It was so good I am starting to think one of the ingredients may have been crack cocaine because they keep asking for the chicken biscuit daily. Of course they seem to want it when it's not breakfast time and it's not being served or when it's Sunday and the place is closed. In all seriousness this is a great place and we are fans of chick fil a and all that it stands for.
