Absolutely, without a doubt, the best Japanese food I've ever had the honor of eating. It is truly a blessing to have been able to eat here twice. \n\nMy boyfriend and I visited Montreal for four days and two of them were spent at Kazu. On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.\n\nWe had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna\/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! \n\nI don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. \n\nMy boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US\/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.\n\nIf you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you! And if you're in Montreal visiting and trying to decide where's a good place to eat, I've decided for you, it's Kazu! GO!
