Furious with this place. Went there for part of my bachelorette party. Got a groupon voucher for eighty dollars worth of food. My bill came out to 79. Including tax. Somehow end up getting charged 40 dollars. I wait FOREVER for the waitress to come back and ask her to fix it. Somehow she still charges me 20. At this point I'm running late and just want to get out. So I left. First time in my life that I didn't tip, but if they ever figure out their mistake, she can have the damn twenty dollars. \n\nAnd the food wasn't even good
