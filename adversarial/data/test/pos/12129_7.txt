I was trying to find another coffee joint but I stumbled upon this one.  I pulled up and some young \"bro\" greeted me in the drive through and asked me what I wanted.  I told him,  a large coffee with extra cream and 3 Splendas.  He texted my order in to the people inside the shop.  I drove up to the window and was greeted by a friendly young person (Identities will not be exposed ;-) lol).  This person was super chipper.  Let me put it this way....... my brother lives up in Humboldt.  He likes to \"garden\" and grow different kind of \"plants\".   This person and my brother would be best friends.  If you have no idea what I am referring to, move along....move along.   Anyways............ I got to the window and assumed that they would have my order ready since the \"bro\" texted it to them.  I was greeted with, \"What are you having today?\"  Um...you should know this, lol.  Anyways, I repeated my order and we started getting to talking.  This person was super duper \"friendly\" and we shot the shit for a minute about our morning.  It came up that it was my first time here.  This person was super excited to hear that and they hooked me up with a punch card and stamped the living shit out of it!  I will get a free coffee soon!  Score!  As far as the coffee, I loved 2 things about it.  1.)  It was a perfect temperature to drink.  It was hot but not mouth scorching.  2.)  I like their cups\/lids.  They have lids with like a little nipple on them which makes it super easy to drink while you are driving. The coffee itself was ok.  I prefer DD over this but I prefer this over Starbucks.  $3.00 for a large coffee isn't cheap, but for the excellent \"happy\" service, cool vibe of the place, and convenience factor, I am a fan.  Don't know how frequent I will be back, but it hit the spot this morning and the customer service was wonderful!
