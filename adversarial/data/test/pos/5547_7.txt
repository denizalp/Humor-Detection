Years later I have moved apartments within the complex and tried to make this place work.. but it just does not get better. Location has kept me here, but the rent keeps rising and t he quality of the situation degrades daily. As many others have said, the fire alarms go off all the time, and as I sit here writing this they are going off again.. for the 4th or 5th time in the last couple of months. It sometimes happens very late at night or very early in the morning. \n\nYou cannot trust what the women in the office say they will follow through and do, if you have any issues. The laundry facilities require you to add funds to a pay-card of sorts and the machines regularly malfunction, eat your money or just plain don't work. When you file a complaint with literally 3 different staff and call the number they say you have to go through.. nothing is fixed. They all pass blame around and the company that is meant to furnish your refunds for the cards, will tell you that they cannot do anything without hearing from the office. The office will tell you it's not their responsibility to deal with the laundry situation. Thus, nothing gets resolved and i'm currently out $36 for laundry. Although, you must understand that you cannot do laundry any other way, but to use these pay cards. (Unless you drive off-property)\n\nThere is SO MUCH noise at all hours. If it isn't the neighbors and children running up and down the hallways.. yes that includes full grown humans as well as kids..  it's an unnecessary leaf blower guy around 830 am. For what reason that needs to happen so often or that early is a mystery. When you ask Brenda or any of the other women in the office.. they say they have no control over the maintenance and yard workers. What do you all have control of??\n\nA few months ago they started major hallway destruction in order to add new wiring for security cameras. When they did that.. they unleashed so many bugs and roaches. I never had any bugs in my apartment until that happened. The doors are not sealed properly and air, and dust.. and BUGS can just crawl underneath the doorway as a result. They gave ZERO notice for the construction and it lasted over a month and would begin as early as 6 am.. directly in front of my door. When I complained, I was told it was basically too bad and that it had to happen. \n\nTo top it all off, my car was stolen last year from my parking space at the complex. As f it weren't a bad enough situation, my car got stolen out from where I live. I'm locked into this lease for a few more months and I cannot barely afford to live here as I got laid off recently, though I have to find a way to get out. \n\n***The alarm has gone off and stopped and gone off again, FOUR TIMES as I sit here and write this for the last few minutes. It's ridiculous. Spend a little more money and stay somewhere else.
