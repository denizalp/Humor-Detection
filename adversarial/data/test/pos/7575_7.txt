3.5 stars\n\nMy wife and I aren't hot dog fans. They're usually the last on our list of fast food choices but we couldn't resist checking this place out for food creativity sake. \n\nWe got a chili cheese dog, a bulgogi dog using the vegetarian dog and the angry kimchi fries. My order of the bulgogi with vegetarian wiener seemed to perplex them so they let me know bulgogi was beef. I just didn't feel like having certain cow parts that evening :) \n\nBoth dogs were really tasty. The bun wasn't a run of the mill and bought at Costco bun which made it feel more gourmet. I loved the flavor of the angry kimchi fries but I would've preferred regular potato over sweet. \n\nThe staff and owner were really nice. They had made an extra bread pudding by mistake and gave it to us for free. The owner told us they make their pudding out of the 2 day old buns they buy direct from a local bakery in town. We had never tried it before since bread pudding always seemed like a way too heavy over the top kind of dessert in restaurants (bread before the entree....and after??) but liked the sweet caramel flavor of this pretty dense \"cake\".\n\nBottom line is if you love hot dogs, you will love this place.
