Yay!! This is a dream come true! I have been going to the Vapeco on Sahara for over a year now, which is a solid 35 minute drive from my house, and now this location is only 3 minutes away! The store is set up exactly the same, and is just as clean and pretty! The staff is super friendly and just as educated compared to the other location. Greg is my favorite! I swear, they have the biggest selection of juices in Vegas. I could literally sit there all day trying them! TO THIS DAY FIVE PAWNS IS STILL MY FAVE THOUGH! \n\nPs. The store is right by the Target (which has a Starbucks) SOOO, I get my lovely coffee fix and walk right over to Vapeco. Super convenient, for the basic beeee that I am! Lol
