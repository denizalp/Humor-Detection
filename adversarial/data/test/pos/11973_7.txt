My best buddy and I were nowhere near this restaurant, minding my own business drinking martinis on a patio trying to decide where to go for dinner. \n\nA Pepper Play:\n\nEW: I'm getting a bit hungry, and a lot tipsy. Where should we go?\nBB: I know where we're going.\nEW: Would you like to tell me?\nBB: No. Cheque please!\n\nApparently he'd seen a video showcasing their brisket earlier that day, and into a taxi we got and up to Dupont. We could smell the place before we could see it, and admittedly I had to wash my hair from their smoker when I got home, but it was all worth it.\n\nWe had their sashimi nachos, pork and beans, ribs, potato salad and some beef salami-like dish. We still have a fridge full of leftovers, and I can't wait to get home and go for round two. To pair with all of these meaty treats they have a cocktail list full of whimsy, including grown up twists on Purple Jesus and coke and red wine sangria. \n\nLook at the photos to understand how awesome the ambiance is. Think outdoor sugar shack, only prettier.
