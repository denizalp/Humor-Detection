If you've never been to Aria, it's a pretty nice hotel.  Pretty damn nice indeed.  Compared to where I stayed at on my last Vegas trip in college (the now defunct Sahara) and well, it's SO MUCH NICER.\n\nPart of City Center, the hotel's decor fits with the concept of the entire complex - a modern, high end sort theme.  One of the newer hotels on the strip, the amenities and creature comforts are plentiful.  Each room is fitted with a centralized touch pad by the bed which controls nearly everything in the room - the lights, A\/C, TV, and the shades.  The views from the rooms that face the strip are gorgeous, and I was actually really impressed by their closets and bathroom.  Weird I know.  BTW, the in-room wi-fi should be included as part of the resort fee.\n\nThe hotel itself includes several bars (one with pretty good happy hour prices!), a club, a dessert\/bakery\/chocolate\/ice cream eatery, to-go food and coffee counters, their buffet, several restaurants, and some retail shops as well (the Crystals mall is right outside the lobby too).  The casino feels cleaner than most by comparison, and I really liked that the air didn't feel thick of cigarette smoke.  Some people might not like the vanilla-ish air freshener smell, but you get used to it quick and it beats the alternative.  I can't describe how nice it is to go back to your room after gambling without carrying the smell of smoke on your clothes.  All of the workers that I interacted with were friendly and nice...especially a couple of the girls working the concierge desk.  So very helpful!  Outside of a doorman who seemed to be having a bad morning, the service certainly made the stay that much better.  \n\nHowever, being a pricier hotel does have a slight drawback...if you're a gambler at least.  The table minimums for a lot of the games seemed to average higher than what you can find at other hotels on the strip (most were a $25 minimum).  If you aren't a gambler though, it's not going to affect you much.  Still, after the first time I stayed at Aria (with my own room to boot!), I ended up coming back during my most recent trip a few months ago.  I can't compare the rooms to that of the Cosmopolitan or Wynn\/Encore, but Aria is pretty amazing!
