I have been a resident of Vaseo for three months now.\n\nCabinets are horrid. They're old plywood type of cabinetry with no handle or knobs. They are painted over with a roller or brush with drip stains. You cant open the drawers without them colliding into the hamdle for the oven door. I had to velcro the cabinet doors shut because they are propped open. The ones that do close are hard to pull open because on humid days it effects the paint which causes them to stick.  They're not quality at all. My appliances were scratched. We asked the complex to replace them upon moving in and they said no. I pulled a tactic and said if theyre not replaced then we wont sign the lease. They still said no. We walked out. You'd think they would call us back but nope! Needless to say, stupid me came back a day later and signed. They still refused to replace them. They said the carpets were new. They weren't and stains returned days later. They refused to clean them. There is no free internet except in the cafe area. The free cable is a joke. ALL plug outlets are loose and they wont hold a plug in. Cars are vandalized often and police frequent the complex often. Not sure if this is true but it seems all the low income residents are placed in the rear of the complex. I see the same low income residents in the hotspot always purchasing aluminum foil. A friend told me that its probably being used for drugs. I dont understand how only the low income residents frequent the cafe to buy foil. Im obviously speculating. The pond\/waterfall in the courtyard is empty and hasnt been filled in weeks. When it is full, its stagnant water which is mosquito heaven! The front office staff can never be available for anything. I was never told that there was another office to file requests and handle things. I went 3 months not knowing this. I never got a tour of the property either. I have yet to see any complex events they hold. The A\/C units do get cold but they are super super loud. Not only that but my roommate has this goddamned koo-koo clock which wakes me up as well. I wanna throw it out the friggin window! The counters are spray painted with a speckle paint. They got the speckle paint all over the mirrors and floor. The complex never did a walk through when we moved in. We did have an opportunity to document what was wrong with the apartment. We listed it on the sheet they gave us but no one ever came to fix it or do a walk through like promised. There are many more things that are review worthy but my fingers are tired from typing! Anyone want that koo-koo clock?
