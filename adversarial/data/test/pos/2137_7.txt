I started a new hobby, soap making, and found this to be the perfect place to buy my supplies. Just log on to www.bulkapothecary.com and shop their great selection of bases, molds, packaging (and scents\/dyes if you want them).\n\nI love the all natural soap bases. I purchased a variety (honey, oatmeal, olive oil and cocoa butter) on my first order and found each of them to be perfect in the individual formulas.\n\nLess than a week after placing my order my tidy package arrived via UPS. I couldn't be more happy with the quality of the soaps.\n\nThis past weekend I sold them at a Holiday Craft Fair and the soaps flew off the shelf. I was able to offer a large size bar at a very good price because bulkapothecary is so reasonably priced.\n\nI'm hooked on perfecting this craft and I know I will be a loyal customer of www.bulkapothecary.com
