Went here for my BD dinner with the Mrs.  Wait staff was very friendly and prompt. I ordered the Juicy Lucy (last one of those I had was over 45 years ago at the 5-8 Club in Minneapolis). Was REALLY good! Love that molten cheese that erupts out of the patty when you bite into it. The burgers are large, as are the side of fries that come with it. We were very impressed with the food and the service, will definitely be back!
