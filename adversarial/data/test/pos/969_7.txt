I'm giving this location 5 stars for the following reasons: There was only one guy working all by himself on a crazy Saturday night... He dealt with so many drunk idiots, including a girl that demanded getting into the rest room that wasn't even dining. This girl was so obnoxious, she was threatening the employee, as well as customers. This guy rang in customers, and made their food. I felt so bad for him. I could never deal with what he was dealing with last night. Pita Pit management\/owners really need to put on another employee at night on the weekends. No one person should have to deal with what that guy dealt with last night. 5 star employee for sure!
