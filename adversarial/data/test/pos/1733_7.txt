I wish you could select 0-stars as the option here. I checked in to the location to get a quote \"free 100% hand wash\". The rude man taking customers out front (with clipboard) realized I was a new customer going for a free wash and says: \"no you can't go car is too low\". I am in a standard height Nissan coupe. \n\nI said ok... Then just spray it with the hose and \"hand\" wash it. He says \"no you must pay custom price for that \"$24.99\". They are simply abusing Yelp deals to draw in customers and immediately void the offer and upsell you. \n\nSteer clear at all costs.
