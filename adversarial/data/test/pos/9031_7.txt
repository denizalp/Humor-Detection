Dr. Lin and his staff are great. I went in for a kidney stone in January 2010 and that went well.  I then went in for the big V in December 2010... it was straightforward, the doctor was very comforting and the procedure went very well.  I'm sure my jokes about strange women grabbing my bits and pieces fell on deaf ears but that's how I dealt with it.  Healing went smoothly and I was back to normal functionality in 3 weeks.  I've had 3 friends go through the procedure elsewhere and all three got infections or some other sort of complication.  I'm happy to say that mine went flawlessly- and as of Friday, in the immortal words of the Cabin Boy- Chris Elliot \"These pipes are clean!!!!!\"
