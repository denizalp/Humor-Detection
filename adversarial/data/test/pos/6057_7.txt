Why you should come here: \nCause it's the weekend, you don't  gotta work tomorrow, and you wanna get TURNT UP!!!!\n\n\nWhere's it located?: \nWay up in the hills...Centennial Hills\n\n\nWhat you should get:\nFor me, it's usually beer and wine, but  Grey Goose and Reed's when it's a Moscow Mule kinda evening. On occasion, they have enpty wine and cigar boxes for a few bucks which makes for some sweet repurposing action. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5
