Dingy and creepy, especially compared to the Warlmart in Peoria. \n\nThe worst part is the plethora of incompetent employees. Female cashier working the Saturday shift tried to ask me for my work ID when I used my personal credit card. Fruit stock-boy told me they didn't carry \"pacific rose\" apples when they were only a few bins away. It would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic.
