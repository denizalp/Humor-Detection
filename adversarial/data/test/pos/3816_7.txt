I never write negative reviews but this place is the WORST HOTEL IN THE WORLD! \n- They take forever to check you in and when they do they have an attitude. \n- If you pay the parking fee with your ticket at the end they will still charge you to your credit card and when you are trying to get the $ back they let you holding forever and pretty much laugh in your face\n- THE ROOMS SMELL REALLY BAD !!\n- I WILL ALSO POST IT IN MY 50K SOCIAL MEDIA KNOW SO NOBODY ELSE EXPERIENCE A NIGHTMARE AT THIS PLACE
