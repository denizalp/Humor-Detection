I feel like I'm in SoCal...not really.\n\nTheir alfresco seating in the back was perfect for this time of the year.  Indoors was a little cramped, but very nicely decorated.  Since fish tacos are their specialty, I had the blackened grouper topped with slaw and cotija cheese.  The fish could've used a little bit more flavor or spice.  I was happy with their corn tortilla which single handedly kept all of the fillings from spilling out.  The house made sangria was not bad.  Carne asada, as usual, for the hubby with ice cold Mission Ale.  He said it also needed a little bit more zing.   I also wanted to try the clam chowder.  Just little too much thickener for my taste with cornstarch or flour but the taste is there with chunks of clams.  My little cutie pie had the popcorn shrimp and fries he raved about.  The portion was pretty big for a kids meal ($5) that came with a drink,\n\nSo far, we enjoyed the food offered at such an awesome price.  I'm glad this one is not too far to frequent!  We'll be back for sure!
