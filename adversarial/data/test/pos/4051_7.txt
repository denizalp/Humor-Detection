I always discourage people from coming into this shop. It's a cute place in the shopping center, and incredibly convenient. But the staff has never been friendly - very blunt and rude, and I always feel like I'm interrupting something by entering the shop. When my Old English sheepdog had some upset stomach issues, I stopped in to look for something to help. A staff member (note: I'm correcting this...because no - I am not sure that it was the owner. The owner wrote in her response to my review that she suggests getting my facts straight, as it is \"grounds for a lawsuit.\" Though her response justs seems to confirm the comment on blunt and rude staff...) told me that if I was going to feed my dog \"road kill\" (Purina Pro Plan, given to me by the breeder) then nothing in the shop would help me. When I had my pup groomed here, at less than 6 months old, the groomer didn't let him out to potty for the 4+ hours he was there. (Another \"get my facts straight to avoid lawsuits\" note: No, I didn't stand in the back with him for the entire time my pup was there, but the groomer was unable to tell me when my pup went potty last... After he lectured me about not brushing my dog's hair every day).\n\nI avoid this place, and happily go down the street or across the road for better service. If you glance at my other reviews, you'll see that I'm a picky pup parent. This place did not meet any of my expectations. But it is a cute looking store. As you can see in the owner's comments, they're \"not for everyone.\" I'm happy to add myself to that list - more so now after the shop owner's response.
