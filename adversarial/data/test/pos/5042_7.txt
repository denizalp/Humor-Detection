I will never waste an ounce of my time, breath or mula here ever again. \n\nThe front desk clerks have no idea what is going on. The Filipino horribly bleached  blonde woman who is the manager or \"whoever is in charge\" lacks professionalism & had no sense of HOSPITALITY of all things. \n\nI had to go to the check in counter THREE TIMES before finding my room because the incompetent staff had given me completely WRONG directions. Mind you we were hauling all of our shit around this crappy place for 45 minutes Trying to find our room\n\nThe elevator I was directed to had NO INDICATION of what it was.. Nor admist the construction was there any indication of a \"detour\" seriously? \n\nThe last fucking thing I wanna do is run around after 6 hours of driving through desert in 110 degree weather trying to find our room. \n\nEver thought of that, assholes? PEOPLE PAY $$ for relaxation and travel far distances to come to your and in the first 10 minutes of being here this Is what we get? \n\nTo top it off.. \n\nThe toilet wouldn't flush. Four people in a room for three days. Don't you think one of those people might have to wiz or drop a deuce during their stay? \n\nI didn't even get comp'd for that drama. For anything. The dumb broad offered a \"late check out\" & all I got was an hour. EVERYONE gets an hour. \n\nWorst Hotel on the strip. \n\nDon't even go to LAX. Go elsewhere. \n\nToo many nice spots in Vegas. Luxor is only good for the facade. Not for anything else.
