For a $14 buffet, that too in Vegas, you would expect some quality. The Breakfast Buffet at the Imperial Palace provides none of that. Avoid this and the lunch buffet as well, at all costs. Seriously, I don't have write anymore for this review; it's just a waste time for you and for me. Just avoid this place, at all costs. It's just that terrible. Why isn't there an option for 0 stars? It's finally deserved. One of the previous reviews is absolutely right about Burger King being delicious compared this; and that's the most barf-able fast food joint of all-time. I've never missed $14 so much in my life.
