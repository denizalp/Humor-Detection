This is a complete shit show and awesome time. Looking at the pictures the next day was almost like the end credits of The Hangover. Amazing.\n\nAt first I was a little worried when we walked in since it was packed and we were a little lost as far as where to go but we grabbed some drinks and managed to scout out a little area not by the main pool area to sit down. Have some drinks, start people watching and before you know it you're hanging out with a bunch of new people having the time of your life.\n\nCabanas, daybeds and such are stupid expensive and unless you can manage a crazy deal not worth it. We had a great time without it. And the $20 drinks aren't a bad deal since they're huge and even though its not top shelf alcohol at least they don't skimp on it. It's probably even a good deal considering the normal price of drinks in Vegas clubs.\n\nI need to go back...ASAP.\n\n***Also you are not allowed to bring in gum, anything glass (MIRRORS INCLUDED) or any bag that is bigger than an 8 1\/2\" x 11\" piece of paper. Bring as little stuff as possible just in case. Security is a little nuts and they do check your bag thoroughly as well as pat you down. Don't bring towels either since they have them there for no charge aside from a tip bucket out for the towel girl***
