I came down here to attend the Strong Beer Festival.  This was my first visit to this joint....and I was really impressed with it.\n\nI am impressed by the staff here.  The bartenders & waitresses were very friendly and knowledgable about all of the beers they had on tap.  I was told by a regular that the owner of the bar (who happened to be working behind the bar helping out) is a beer connoisseur who will frequently bring in awesome craft beer for everyone to enjoy for short periods of time.  The regulars also told me he's really cool and loves to hangout with the guests.  This is the kind of bar I love....too bad it's 10,000 miles away from my house.....not quite that far, but it's too far to make it a regular hangout.\n\nI also like how there are 3 pool tables in the bar with 2 in a separate room and 1 near the main bar.  Usually you find them crammed together in one location and people get in each other's way.  Not here...you can shoot pool near the bar or if you prefer to hang with just pool players, go into the other room.\n\nThe beer for the Strong Beer Festival was awesome too....here's a rundown of what I can remember drinking:\n\nBallast Point\nSculpin IPA - 3 of them...one of my favorites from the night.\n\nDogfish Head Craft\nOld School Barleywine (15% abv) - this was very sweet...didn't really like it.\nFort  (18% abv) - this was even sweeter than the Barleywine....and got me hammered.\nSah'tea - This was my favorite  of the 3 from Dogfish\n\nRogue Brewery\nXS Imperial IPA - really enjoyed this, but very bitter.\n\nFirestone IPA - Another solid one...I've had it before.\n\nDeschutes Brewery\nHop Henge IPA - Very good, one of my favs of the night\nJubel 2010 - This is another solid beer.....the bartender Tony suggested I try it....I had 2 or 3 of these, can't remember.\n\nTenaya Creek\nHop Ride IPA - yummy....I tasted this at the Beerfest @ the Art District.....had a lot of it that day, so I only had one Fri night.\n\nWill I return?  Next time I'm on this side of town or next Strong Beer Festival!
