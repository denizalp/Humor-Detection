For your doctor recommended coffee needs, head to Dr. Bob's Coffee. This adorable little shop is in the Jerry's Artarama plaza and offers Passport coffee and tea, good stuff!\n\nThe shop has only been open for a few months. I asked the barista if they had a signature drink but since they are so new he said they did not. I decided on the nitro cold brew with a bit of cream. \n\nThere was plenty of seating when I got here, so we took a spot towards the back. The nitro cold brew was pretty good! It had a smooth mellow taste, with very little acidity. \n\nMy one criticism about this place is they are never open when I usually want coffee, which is right before work. If they were open earlier I'd definitely opt for Dr. Bob's over the nearby Starbucks.
