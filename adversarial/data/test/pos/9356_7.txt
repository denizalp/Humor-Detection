Update!  I thought it was odd last time when the waitress asked if I wanted to take my Monkey Business Milkshake home with me....and then she packed it up to go.  I've never heard of alcohol in a go cup in Pennsylvania!  Oooopppssss....apparently she made a mistake and that was a big no-no.  \n\nWhat a shame, this time that all that milkshake-y goodness went to waste when we couldn't finish the apple pancake caramel vodka bacon milkshake.  Sigh.  We also noticed a number of less than half-finished milkshakes on other tables.  Hint.  Go for the adult milkshake OR a burger, not both.  Or finish the milkshake-with-a-kick and (legally) take the burger leftovers to go.
