While everyone is shopping the day after Thanksgiving (i.e. Black Friday), I'm going to take advantage of one of the busiest Gold's Gyms in Las Vegas and get my workout on (i.e. Back Friday).  What do I mean by taking advantage?  I've heard it and you might have heard it...this is one busy Gold's Gym.  I figured that I can only get a good workout here during the early, early AM, or during a busy shopping day.  \n\nI'm a Gold's Gym and a 24 Hour Fitness member.  And because Vegas is such a small city, I tend to hit different gyms based on what I'm working on or the time of the day. Some gyms out here have to be avoided during different times, especially peak times.  This is one of those gyms.  It's one of the more popular Gold's out here and it isn't the biggest.  Combine the two and you get one packed gym.  That being said, I do avoid this gym during peak hours.  My reason for 4 stars is because it's clean and there's plenty of equipment.  This gym is also a great back\/lat gym with a T-Bar, multiple Hammer leverage machines, plenty of cables, and of course, free weights.  That's all you really need for a good back workout. I didn't work any other body parts but noticed that this gym is stacked with plenty of power racks, benches, and Smith machines.  So, I assume this is also a good chest and leg gym too.  As for cardio, either it's lacking or there's just a lot of cardio Dukes & Duchesses here.  Here's my tip...if you see one open, take it.  \n\nOther Highlights:\n-Tanning Room (if you have this added too the membership)\n-Cardio Theater\n-Clean Locker Room.\n-Cool Staff\n-Well Ventilated\n-A lot of parking spots\n-Fitness Classes\n\nIf you're a Gold's member, looking to mix things up, and working out during their non-peak hours, give this Gold's Gym a try.  \n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (494\/500)
