Really good hipster fish and chips place. I've eaten at the other location in the Plateau and both are prepared in similar decor.  We came here before a night out and concert at the Olympia theatre. Having the fortunate opportunity to travel lots to Maritime Canada I eat quite a bit of fish and chips there! If you eat fish n chipper in Moncton, Halifax, St John's or places in between it's usually super fresh and amazing! Seriously it's hard to get any better! I would only say in the UK could it taste better! \n\n\n So here at C21 I'd proclaim the batter is up to snuff but I question if it's fresh and not frozen de-thawed fish? I asked the guy serving us and he said it was Cod. Forgot to ask if it was fresh or frozen? It was probably fresh as I'd think weird for a restaurant to use frozen fish but you never know!  It tended to flake apart a bit so this is why I question if it was frozen. None the less it was scrumptious and a very healthy serving. My meal was the large version which came with three pieces. I had it of course with poutine. The poutine was prepared in a thick brown sauce with good amount of cheese. You have a choice between lots of different spiked mayo's. I had it with the Paprika which was nice and spicy. We ate dinner with a green salad that was fresh had a great brownish dressing and was great to share with the wifey. She had a glass of white wine and I had a Boreale blonde beer pint. All good in that department. \n\nI've not eaten Fish and Chips at many places in a Montreal this sure is a strong option. It's reasonably priced ($57.65 w tax n tip included) for the two of us with salad and drinks. \n\nWorth a comeback again even if the fish was a bit flaky!
