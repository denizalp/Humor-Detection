Definitely the best pho I've had in Arizona. Broth is flavorful and everything is very authentic. Pho tai ($6.50) is a good classic dish to order. My sister ordered the pho dac biet ($6.75) which includes steak and tripe (intestinal lining). We agreed that the pho here was really bomb and that we'd gladly return. The restaurant is kind of a hole-in-the-wall in a semi-sketchy area, but the food is well worth it.\n\nI also ordered 6 macarons because I was tempted by all the yelp pictures. They are $1.50 and larger than macarons sold at other places. They were delicious and very pretty to look at. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and prices are very reasonable.\n\nTIP: Free drink with yelp check-in!
