Being completely exhausted by days and days of a convention--I really wanted a place to just crash into deep and unrepentant slumber night after night. The Tropicana is in a prime location to do this cheaply and keep my bank account happy. \n\nBy the reviews, I was really expecting to find a dead body in my bathtub when I'd come home at night. No luck. No needles in my trash receptacles or homeless person outside of my room. My search was fruitless. Some guests get all the luck!\n\nO.K,.to be clear--the place is a dump. The casino smells like a bowling alley. The decor is un-apologetically vintage. This hotel is like staring at a a severely wounded animal on its last limb before it expires into a vague memory. It's not ritzy or chic, but it is cheesy, even ludicrous in appearance. Therein lies it's charm. At least to me. The Tropicana is a strange remnant of an Old Las Vegas--outshined by its excessively glamorous neighbors.\n\nSince I was rolling solo, the Tropicana served me just fine. If you've come to Vegas to feel like a rock star, stay elsewhere. If you feel like being kind to your bank account and would like a prime location on the strip--the Tropicana has got your back! The beds might not, but the hotel does.
