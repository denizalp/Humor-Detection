This place is very deceiving. At first the apartment was very nice but in the four months my fianc√© and I have lived here, we have had more problems than we ever had in years of renting other places. \nDownsides:\nThere is basically no fitness room.\nThere are no rules in the complex enforced as far as in the pool area and around the complex. \nChildren run around the entire complex and play in the street with no supervision and management does nothing about it.\nThree months into our lease, we started noticing bugs EVERYWHERE in our apartment. We had our apartment sprayed multiple times and our apartment is always spotless.\nEvery time you call the front office of the complex, no one ever answers the phone.\nAnd as for the quality of the apartment, we pay way too much for this place. \n\nWe came from an apartment complex across the street and paid more and we are definitely going back because it is actually worth what we pay over there. We will not resign our lease after it is up. We do not recommend this place at all. Go across the street to Stadium Village or La Borgata, WAY BETTER!
