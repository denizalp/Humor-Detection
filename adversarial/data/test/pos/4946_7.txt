Ah, New Year's Eve. We're about to leave 2016 behind and enter into 2017. Of course, by the time this is posted, it'll be 2017 already and in that case: HAPPY NEW YEAR!\n\nSo I took 2.5 flights out of this dumpster fire known as 2016. I had a good Mimosa Flight (OJ, blueberry pomegranate, strawberry, and mango peach), an amazing Bloody Mary Flight (Verde Bloody Mary made with vodka, salted rim, and garnished with tomatillo, cucumber, and jalape침o; Spicy Thai Sriracha made with Sriracha, vodka, salted Sriracha rim, and garnished with jalape침o; The Oink Bloody Mary made with The Oinked house Bloody Mary mix, vodka, bacon salted rim, and garnished with a bacon strip, celery, green olive, lemon and lime; and the Bloody Maria made with Cholula, 100% Agave Tequila, salted rim, and garnished with a lime and chicharr칩n), and a decadent half Bacon Flight (applewood, hickory, jalape침o, and chef's choice of pecanwood). I also ordered the Pork Confit Benedict [Toasted English muffin, Chef's special pork confit with poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce] and nibbled on some Huevos Rancheros [Two eggs on corn tortillas covered with a spicy homemade ranchero sauce served with beans and a flour tortilla]. Least to say, I had a two-hour food coma before leaving 2016 behind!\n\nThe food here is great. My eggs for the benedict were a bit over cooked but the tender pork confit made it easy to forgive the cook. Also, they were super generous with the hollandaise sauce which makes my heart happy (and probably a little clogged). The Huevos Ranchero had a good amount of heat and was flavorful. I'd probably skip the Bacon Flight if I came back.  It was a bit underwhelming but a great concept for bacon lovers.  I'd love to come back to try their Biscuits & Gravy and their Mac & Cheese!\n\nAll in all, The Oink Cafe was a great way to end the year. Service was amazing given how insanely busy it was, food was tasty, and the lime green walls were both horrendous and charming. I dig The Oink Cafe! 3.5 stars easily.
