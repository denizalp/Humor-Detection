Tuesday night, restaurant is empty as you can see from my photo, and the service was as slow as molasses. We had to go get our server to order. Unfortunate really. \n\nNow to start on the menu! Oh dear. 200 options for wings but No explanations for the random named flavours lol. So if 200 flavours were not daunting enough add no real way to decide what to order other than trying to rely on your server to know what you do and do not like. Insert frustration lol. \n\nWe had a few hiccups with our orders but the manager was awesome and he took them off our bill no questions asked and made sure to come over and check if we needed anything else. My friends chicken came raw and my salad was half wilted \n\nI will give his place another shot. Hopefully I'll be able to update my review with a better experience.
