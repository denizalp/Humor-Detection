Before Gita, I used to get my eyebrows waxed but one day I saw her stand at the mall and I was like, I'm going to give this a try. So glad I did, I not only like my eyebrows, I love my eyebrows. She is amazing at what she does and has many years of experience. When she moved to what I like to call another planet, I was so sad. I sure did not want to drive 30 minutes for my eyebrows so I tried other places because they were closer but I can't. Eyebrow threading is an art and Gita is my favorite artist. She is a perfectionist and the prices are extremely affordable, $11 for eyebrows is simply the best price ever. She also offers some sort of loyalty program; you get the 7th or 8th threading free. Gita is the best and she is a sweetheart. Go visit her and you won't regret it.
