A great menu full of low-country favorites, a friendly staff and a warm and inviting space all come together to make SOHO one of Cleveland's true culinary gems. We paid them a visit on a Saturday evening, 6ish and our timing was perfect. The entire bar was empty as were most of the tables. Just how we like it. We bellied up to the bar and were immediately greeted with a pair of menus, some waters and a smile. So far so good. \n\nThe decor is a well-designed combo of urban mechanics and southern hospitality. Light woods intermingled with stone complimented by a really cool metal cut-out silhouette of the Cleveland skyline on the back wall. The front windows also do a great job of illuminating what would otherwise be a pretty tiny dark spot.\n\nThe libations are a concise melange of whisky tinged cocktails and American craft ales that has something for just about everyone. While not a massive beer selection (there are plenty of spots down the street if that's what you're looking for), I did manage to find a new beer to try, Abita's Spring IPA, a wonderfully hoppy, sessionable rendition of one of my favorite styles. My wife went with one of their signature mixed drinks the name of which escapes me - something sweet, slightly fruity with plenty of bourbon. She described it as \"effective\".\n\nThe menu at SOHO is not for those looking to count calories. It's southern comfort food without apology. There was a reason that Paula Deen was over 200lbs at one point and the culprits are butter and frying, both of which are in great supply on their menu. Fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, fried chips, fried chicken, bourbon butter sauce, lobster butter...I'm sure you get the picture. Sure, there are a couple of salads at the top but if you aren't careful you'd probably run right past them on your way to the fried chicken with mac 'n cheese and sweet potato jojo fries. Here's how our meal went down:\n\nHouse-made pimento cheese dip - I've never had pimento cheese before. It was like a combination of cream cheese and shredded cheddar. Tasty, sure, but way too thick for the super-thin chips to manage. A dip this hearty needs a vehicle with more junk in its trunk -  sourdough bread? Pita? Something. A word of warning on this one, it's spicy. Both the chips and the dip probably have cayenne pepper in them so if you are averse to heat stay away.\n\nRuby 'cado salad - Not a bad salad to kick things off. Fresh spinach, avocado, blood orange slices, goat cheese (ours was missing this ingredient, more on that in the service review), raw almonds and a sweet honey mustard vinaigrette. A spring salad if I've ever seen one.\n\nDeviled eggs - Probably one of the biggest disappointments of the meal. They were good, don't get me wrong, but I can make these. They reminded me of what you'd get at a work pot luck bbq. There was nothing \"elevated\" or special about them and at $5.50 for three halved eggs I just wanted more.\n\nSouthern fried chicken, evenin' style - I got this version essentially by accident. There was a miscommunication between my wife and the bartender and voila, here's what I got. The bourbon gravy was stunning and I'm just not a big fan of collards, although these were cooked way down and quite tasty (spicy, too). The mashed potatoes were also perfect, velvety smooth and seasoned just right. The chicken was also pretty tasty, fried a wonderful golden brown it was juicy and well-seasoned. My biggest gripe would have to be with the batter. It just wouldn't stay on the chicken. As soon you I knifed it it crumbled off. I found myself having to eat the chicken and the breading separately. Not a huge deal just a bit of a PITA.\n\nThe service we had at the bar was wonderful. Our water glasses were always full and the follow-up was spot on. As I mentioned above, our salad was missing the goat cheese. We decided to mention it in passing to the bartender just as a heads-up for the kitchen and what did she do? She comped my wife's drink. Pure class. I only wish the other restaurants in the area would take some notes from the folks at SOHO. This is how it's done.\n\nWe had a really nice dinner experience at SOHO and we will definitely return. The food was all lovingly prepared and the support staff couldn't have been more pleasant. Sure, there were a couple of hiccups that knocked off a star, but those things happen. Well done guys. We'll see ya'll soon.
