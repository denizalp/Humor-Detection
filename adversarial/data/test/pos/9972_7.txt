Not impressed at all. I have never written a review before tonight, but felt you all should know the bad food that I received here. \nI always get the Lasagna my first visit to an Italian restaurant, that sets them all on an even playing field and this place failed. I got a mouthful of stems from herbs OR something and then I bit into a chunk of something hard that's not supposed to be in a lasagna. The server offered me a new plate, but I did not want anything more after that. She apologized and did remove it from our bill. My mother in laws pasta was severely under cooked, but the shrimp was moist and tender. \nNeedless to say, I will not return to this restaurant.
