Take your average hot-blooded, MMA watching, bacon ravening meat-a-tarian ( in this case my husband) and they'll be mighty impressed by the exceptional food here. You see The Hogtown Vegan have taken staple carnivore faves like wings, burgers, sausage and steak and turned it on it's head in unconventional vegan style. So it's all the flavour and none of the guilt (and heartburn) associated with eating cuteness like this http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_KrW6AKWMT0\n\n Upon being seated on arrival we peruse the expansive vegan menu and I'm really torn as there are so many mouth-water rendering options. I also appreciate that Hogtown's menu notes items that are gluten or nut free which makes ordering fuss free.\n\n For starters we order the deliciously crisp and spicy\/tangy tofu wings\/triangles. I marvel at how rich and creamy the dairy free sour cream is, simply divine! The best part is that you can eat these wings with a fork. Hubby decides to order The Big Hog burger which is a hearty soy patty with melted Daiya cheese, lettuce pickles and Hogtown's own house mayo.  Hubby is savouring his burger with delight as I steal a couple of the temptingly crisp fresh cut fries off his plate.\n\nFor my main I have the cornbreaded sausage, which are two tofu sausage patties that are corn batter fried. Damn! This was a sausage party in my mouth, not to mention it's mad savory accompaniments of onion relish, molasses sweet potato mash and collared greens! MMMmmm All this Southern fried goodness is enough to make me want to break out and do the \"Dougie\" but being that the music playing here was less Dirty South hip-hop and more Stevie Nicks and the undulating strains of Nico and the Velvet Underground (which is fine by me!) I decide not to make a yokel of myself.\n\nService was friendly and very prompt given that it was a busy Saturday night bustling with a full house and a line-up 10 deep waiting to be seated!  The clientele is a casual mix of locals and hipster-ish young-un's and the decor is your usual diner vibe with walls painted an intensely hued Kelly green, but who gives a @#$% about furnishings when the food is THIS GOOD!  Oh and another thing, dinner consisting of an appy, two entrees and a Flying Monkey Hoptical Illusion beer for hubby came to about $45 in total!!  Folks, it don't get any better than this place!\n\nIn closing, The Hogtown Vegan serves up excellent comfort food in vegan style. If you haven't already had the pleasure of dining at the Hogtown, get your hungry ass over here already!  You won't be dissappointed!
