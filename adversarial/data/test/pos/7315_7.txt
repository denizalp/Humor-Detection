I usually come here once a trip to try the 20x crap table.  Pulling into the hotel i usually take the left hand entrance to the parking lot which usually has more stalls and you start on the 2nd fl.  This time it was blocked off, so i went around to find a parking attendant a the booth.  He said there was a $3 charge for parking (which started feb 1) but I could get it back in the casino with my players card and obtain 200 pts.  There seemed to be a lot of employees from other casinos\/shops around the area parking there for work. \n\nNot staying at any boyd properties or using vacations hawaii i didnt bring my card.  So  i went to the players center to reissue my card.  Played craps cashed out and handed the cashier my ticket to get my $3 back.  She said I had to scan my card and get a receipt and come back.  I found a scanner, but it asked for my pin which i didn't know, so i had to go back to the players club to reset my pin. did that and found i didn't show any points played for today.  I just played $500 on crap, but apparently they don't register it right away.  At this point i said F it and let them keep my $3.\n\nGood because now I have a reason not to return to this place or downtown.\n\nAt least they have someone on social media as I posted my checkin on yelp(with twit and fb added) bashing this place.  I soon received a tweet replying telling me something i already.  \"Yes we do charge $3 for parking but it is easily returned to you\"........NOT
