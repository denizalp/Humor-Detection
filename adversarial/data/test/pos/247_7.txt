This is the official Starbuck's of the Grand Bazaar Shops. At the time of this review, it is inching toward it's 1 year anniversary. It had been the baby Starbuck's of the Strip until the Cosmopolitan opened one a few weeks ago. \n\n   You could say that this is the Strip's Grand Bazaar and grand bizarre Starbuck's. It is a bizarre Las Vegas Strip Starbuck's for the fact it is the only one that I know of on a Strip hotel property (Grand Bazaar is part of Bally's) that charges acceptable prices. For example, a venti coffee Frappuccino that is $7 before tax at numerous Las Vegas Strip hotels came to around $5 after tax here. Another reason that it is bizarre for the Las Vegas Strip is that it is one of a couple with patio seating. This came close to being one of the most bizarre Starbuck's in the World when it was initially planned to serve coffee and alcohol. This is the one and only Starbuck's that I have been to with indoor bleacher style seating. \n\n   The Grand Bazaar Starbuck's makes for a convenient meeting place on the Las Vegas Strip. At the famous crossroads of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, it is in the center of the Strip. This worked out perfect for my family during the Staycation. My dad and I would walk from NY-NY undecided on what to do when my brother met up with us. In this central Strip location, my brother would Park at Caesar's or Paris then meet us here where we were in the center of the action. \n\n   The patio creates a special Starbuck's experience. This is where the Grand Bazaar Shops leads into the Bally's escalator. The patio shops is a front row seat to people watching. Being the Las Vegas Strip, there will be interesting people watching. On any given day Hello Kitty, a Minion, Spider Man, Mickey Mouse or some other costumed street performer could be passing through. When the moon and stars are out, the patio seats are a prime viewing spot for the hourly light show at the Grand Bazaar Shops. \n\n   The Central Strip location also benefits the advantage of using this Starbuck's for coffee on the go. It is very close to Paris and the Bellagio water fountains. As a matter of fact, just a few feet away the Grand Bazaar Shops sofa benches overlook the Bellagio water fountains and the top of the Eiffel Tower. \n\n   The Grand Bazaar Starbuck's is a Las Vegas Strip location that is worth stopping by for a caffeine boost or unique Starbuck's experience. I am unfamiliar with any other Starbuck's in the World where a few feet from the coffee bar you can sit on a sofa bench and look up at the Eiffel Tower, dancing water fountains, and towering hotel towers. This is a Starbuck's experience that captures a Las Vegas experience.
