I grew up going to the San Diego Zoo and the San Francisco Zoo, yet I LOVE this zoo!!! \nIt's surprising large and there are so many fun things to do.\nFor my first time there I got to FEED A GIRAFFE, ride on an ELEPHANT, pet a MANTA-RAY and chill in a cage filled with monkeys.\nNow this may not be very exciting for some of you, but In San Diego\/San Francisco, you have to drop some money to do activities like that, not 5-10 dollars. \nThe food here is moderately priced as well, so you aren't spending an arm and a leg on a pretzel.\nSo I felt very VIP when I was here. \nI advise that you were something you are comfortable in walking in all day, clothes and shoes. Because there is a ton of ground to cover. \nThe staff here is awesome as well, very knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions you have. \nI'm bringing everyone I know that visits from out of town to this place. As long as it's not in June, or July, or August.....really anytime that it's hot. Hahahaha
