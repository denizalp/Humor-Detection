There was no music on the night that we went so I have no idea what this place is like as a bar.   I am in Calgary on business and just wanted a place that was decent.\n\nWe came based on yelp reviews and was horribly disappointed.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in I should have known it was going to be bad.  While it was decently busy for being a bit early for dinner (6ish) it took several minutes to catch the waitresses attention to ask if we could sit wherever.\n\nWhen she came to the table she only brought one menu for two people.  Apologized for it but then never came back with a 2nd menu.  When she brought the appetizer (fried pickles - they were good) she again brought only a single plate (there were two of us).\n\nI ordered the Mac & Cheese and my coworker ordered the Jambalaya.   The mac & cheese was not very cheesy at all and whatever sausage they used was most definitely NOT andouille.   His Jambalaya was pretty sad.  The rice was way overcooked and just in a tomato sauce.  There was no cajun seasoning at all.  I don't know what kind of meats were supposed to be in it, but it was pretty fishy.\n\nOur waitress stopped by while eating to let us know she was going off shift and needed to check us out.  When she came back with the credit card machine she brought her car keys but not a pen to sign the receipt.\n\nI genuinely don't understand the good reviews on the food here.  It definitely looks like it might be a good place for drinks and music, but DO NOT eat here.\n\n********* Updated 04\/25\/2014 *********\nBoth of us ended up getting sick from the food.
