So awesome I had to write my review while I was still here, letting the food settle to make room for more!\n\nThey've only been open for 2 weeks now, so they are still pretty empty (taking the old space of Lao Thai). Quiet-ish pop music plays in the background with a few tvs turned to sports (sound off). Owner (or manager?) says they are working to get karaoke set-up so that will be hilarious in the future. \n\nMy \"opening specials\" were different than what is posted in yelp images, FYI. Regardless, I grabbed a $5 cab and ventured to the full menu for some yummy miso ($2) and the Blazing Alaska roll ($9). \n\nThe wait staff were super friendly and attentive. \n\nI see myself becoming a regular here!
