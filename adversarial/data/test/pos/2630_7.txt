Let's Go Shoppin!!!! Where??? H&M of Course! \n\nThis Location is in the Galleria Sunset Mall in Henderson, NV\nSituated in Between Kohl's and JCPenney! \n\nThe Reason Why I Love this Location is....it is 2 Levels!!! Yes, 2 Levels! Upstairs is Women's Wear, and Downstairs are the Men's Wear! This Store is Very Similar to the Location inside The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace! The Prices are the Same at Every Location, but This Location is Very Clean & Well Maintained! Although at Times, the Salespeople aren't Readily Available...You can Find what You're Looking for On Your Own! \n\nThere Really isn't Too Much to Say About a Clothing Store, but If you don't like Crowds too Much, Try this Location! Prices are Very Reasonable...and they seem to have a Sale Almost Every Time I Go There!
