I'm not usually one to judge on appearances but as the \"Hooters Girl\" is supposed to be iconic. About half of them met what I expected however there seemed to be a serious lack of personality and training.  Normally when I walk in and recognize staff I am happy as I love to see great people bringing life to new businesses, however 2\/3 of the people I recognized who work here are the kind of people I would tell friends NOT to hire, whether it be for a history of theft, terrible attitudes, or just plain stupid.\n\nThe grand opening wasn't something I cared too much about but their Facebook ads bragged about their ALL YOU CAN EAT WINGS! I'm always a fan of wings, however they were NOT available due to the (understandable) growing pains of training and warming up in the first few weeks. Them not being available is ok, but its management 101 to NOT advertise something you're not even offering. QC law could have a field day if someone decided to take up such a fight.\n\nThe menu itself looked good, reasonably priced for the area and the brand however some items were slightly overpriced. I laughed at the wings that were delivered to a customer sitting near me at the bar. Six sad little wings for $8+tax\/tip. I grabbed a build your own burger. Surprisingly it was actually SUPER juicy for a chicken breast so well done on that front. Another legal issue they may run into is that for the burger its listed under the cheese that \"extra cheese is 1.99\" or whatever price, however asking for ANY cheese is considered extra, therefore the menu should read, \"cheese 1.99 extra\" such as the way it is correctly listed for added costs on certain other toppings. Not worth an argument but still, another 101 that they missed, which in QC can f*** you proper with the wrong clientele. The burger was great, however the fries were undercooked and way over salted. Have to drown it in ketchup level of over salted.\n\nAs for the service, I was definitely one of the luckier ones. I landed at the bar and was served by the fun and energetic Caroline S. Five stars for her as even the things that were out of her control\/beyond her knowledge she made a point of making a good time of. Had I been served by anyone else, I'm sure I would have left with no intention of coming back, however I'll wait until they get their s*** together and give them another shot.
