Pawn Shop or Tourist Attraction?\n\nAs someone who frequently seeks out cultural memorabilia in pawn shops and thrift stores, I have always found Las Vegas to be a treasure trove.  In fact, before the show Pawn Stars (of which I am a fan) premiered, I went into Gold and Silver Pawn several times and even purchased a few items from them.\n\nBut, the success of the show, as can be expected, has changed Gold and Silver Pawn quite dramatically. Now, if you go to the shop, as so many do, expect to wait in line for quite a long time to get inside. If you're lucky, and you drive by the shop at just the right time, you may be able to get in without waiting in line. But, that is very rare. \n\nAlso, once inside, don't expect to see only a few customers as is depicted on T.V.  It is pretty much always filled with a line of tourists walking their way through the shop, asking to see items that were purchased on the show. Which they never seem to have...\n\nSome people comment about the lack of congenial service. The people who say this have, most likely, never been into an actual pawn shop. The employees are not there to be friendly, they are there to make money.  And, I can imagine it gets pretty annoying to constantly be asked, \"Where's the Old Man or where's Chumlee?\" \n\nThe thing about Gold and Silver Pawn is you must understand what you're getting into before you go there. Number one, expect a line -- both inside and out. Number two, you may, but you probably won't, see any of the show's cast members. Finally, (no disrespect intended), but if you actually want to buy or sell something at a pawn shop in Las Vegas, it is probably best to go to one of the other pawn shops in the area that are not dominated by the tourist trade.
