Any Cuban Latin jazzy music fans in the house? If so, I strongly recommend a Friday night visit to a Piece Of Havana. Found within which warm friendly atmosphere, extraordinary service, and drinks that will have you ready to get up and try your steps.\nInitially thought of being good and simply ordering a caesar salad, but the lure of oxtails won me over, and oh, was I happy that I made them change. Their oxtails were tender, extraordinarily seasoned, and pleasing to the palate..\nA taste of the empanadas also proved to be a wise choice, especially the beef. The washing is down with the cool crisp mojito, I was ready to try my Latin two step on the dance floor with everyone else...\nCome on down on Friday night and get your tastebuds pleased and your dance step on at a Piece Of Havana.
