Yorkville has a rich history of dudes tossing money around. In 1903, the Chief Librarian in Toronto wrote to Andrew Carnegie (yes, that one) about an endowment. Being the consummate philanthropist, Carnegie flipped a cool $350 grand northward and the Yorkville library was born. \n\nThis library was designed by city architect Robert McCallum, who was known for this scepticism of \"modern\" construction technology like concrete. One step inside, and you might become nostalgic for his quaint sense of conservatism. It's quite beautiful, airy, and bright in the Yorkville library and it doesn't have the Municipal Stink I usually associate with city-owned buildings.\n\nThere aren't that many books in here and only a few communal tables for working. Typical patrons range from ages 2 to 92 with little in between. A gorgeous space but considering that you can see Toronto's largest library (Toronto Reference Library) from their front steps, one would come here to take part in their programming or to bask in the architectural ludditism of Robert McCallum, if just for a moment.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: This ain't not the Rosedale Library.\n\nMenu Readability: If there were a thing called 'applicable' this is not it.\n\nNeed to mention: Pretty busy in the middle of the day, actually.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I should write more letters to billionaires.
