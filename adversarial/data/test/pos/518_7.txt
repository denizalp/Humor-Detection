Great place, really happening.  We found a spot in the bar area.  It was around 7:30 p.m.  and it was crowded.  We had a few tapas, I loved the stuffed dated and one of the stuffed peppers.  Also the steak tapas were really good.  I ordered a Ginger Pear martini, very nice.  This place gets pretty loud, but still fun.  Service was good, my husband loves this place, he brings people every time he is in town, so it was my turn, haha.
