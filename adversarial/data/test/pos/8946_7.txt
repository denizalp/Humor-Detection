I have to interrupt my chain of wedding related reviews for this one... I've always been a huge supporter of animal rescue organizations, and while I rescued Minnie from a small rescue site seven years ago, I've supported the Humane Society through the years with monetary donations as much as possible.  But yesterday, I did something different...\n\nI started my day (just like Melissa H) by rolling over to look into Minnie's eyes and be reminded how lucky I am to have an incredible dog that has become my family... After our morning walk and breakfast, I teamed up with a group of friends and we made the trek out to Dobbins Road and 19th Avenue to volunteer at the Humane Society.  I had no idea what to expect and I hadn't seen the reviews that came before mine, but I was extremely impressed at the size, cleanliness, and friendly staff at this fabulous facility.\n\nDuring our three hours on-site, Kathy Chumley gave us a tour of the building,  told us about the history of society, and educated us on how they operate, the animals they care for, the staff they employ, the volunteers that help, etc... We saw the cutest dogs, cats, bunnies, and horses and we helped with feeding the horses, petting the cats and bunnies (I guess this helps socialize them), and putting leashes together too.\n\nIf and when I adopt another animal, the Humane Society is where I'll go to do it... and I highly suggest checking this place out if you're looking to add to your family as well.
