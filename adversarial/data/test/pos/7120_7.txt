Now that I have slept on the floor here, I feel intimately connected.\n\nPluses:\n1. Free wireless!  I'm using it now.\n2. It's now smoke-free!\n\nMinuses:\n1. It's an airport, which means it was designed to be uncomfortable.\n2. I can't find one place where I'm not hearing the Wheel of Fortune slot machine.  Why do you follow me, O Wheel of Fortune slot machine??\n\nAnyway, I've been here for 12 hours, and all I have to say is that I'm desperate for a potted plant.  Any potted plant would do.  I think I'd even cozy up to poison oak.  For now, I'm happy with smoke-free airports, but someday someone is going to get wise and airports will have botanic gardens.  Then we won't feel the need to scream while the airlines screw us over and throw our bags into dumpsters.
