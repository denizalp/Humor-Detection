I highly suggest you consider not staying here. WORST elevators in the world. I waited around for a stupid elevator more than I did anything else. \n walked into my shower with boogers on the wall, called housekeeping for two days it took to get it clean. \nThe only saving grace is Darren banks, coolest host in downtown. If it wasn't for him, I would never come here.
