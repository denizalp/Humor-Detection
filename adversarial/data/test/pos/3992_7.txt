This location is the closest one to my old shop. 12-15 years ago, after multiple messed up orders and not finding anybody on staff that spoke enough English to fix the orders, I stopped going here.  Recently I was driving down the street and saw the sign and decided chicken was what I wanted for lunch.  The order came out correct, The staff spoke English and service was pleasant.
