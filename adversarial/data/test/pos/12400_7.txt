We came here for some post hike nourishment, and this is what we got:\n\nGood: 3 cheese corn, Brussels Sprouts\n\nOkay: Pulled Brisket Sandwich, Gritz, Mac and cheese\n\nNot so good: Fried Green Tomatoes, Beef Ribs\n\n*Beef Ribs, Fridays and Saturdays only, 3 ribs, $16.95...originally going with St. Louis Ribs, it was highly suggested by one of the workers...bad move, ONE of the three ribs were edible, the other two were more bone than meat, and were dried out, and I've had beef ribs that were meatier and fell off the bone. Bell's ribs were disappointing. The Banana Sweet Jar we got a taste of was very good though.\n\nMost of the sides and sweets are where it's at...sadly, not for the BBQ....ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  3
