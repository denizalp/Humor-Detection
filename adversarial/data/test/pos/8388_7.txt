I agree with Julia D's review so hard. I have 2 decades of great and blurry memories from McKibbins at this point (don't worry about the math, just let it go ;). From relaxing beers with smart peers and profs downstairs, carrying on the inspiring conversations we had started in class with an extra dash of ale, to crazy ladies night dance parties on the top floor where time does not exist. In my experience, this is not a gastropub or a destination bar for beer nerds or food snobs. They serve the classic pub pints and hearty eats, and they serve them well and kindly, and the mixed crowd seem to find each other entertaining. This is just a fun, quality, classic pub in the downtown Concordia area and sometimes that's everything you need.
