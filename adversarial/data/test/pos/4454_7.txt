When I first went in August here I had a Brazilian appointment with Kennedy and she was absolutely incredible. She was thorough, so friendly, and made me feel so comfortable. She did not rush through the process and our conversation was genuine and smooth. Each step of the way she explained what was going on and what she was using, and I barely even noticed the pain because we were talking and laughing so much. She did such an amazing job right before my vacation to Cancun and I was so pleased with the results. She also sold me on the serum without being too pushy as the receptionists typically can be (understandably, from a business perspective you should absolutely upsell but know the limit and when to stop). The serum by the way works incredibly! I thought it could definitely prevent ingrowns but not get rid of the ones I had, surely. Much to my surprise it did rid of the ones I had! So pleased.\n\nFast forward to coming back here in December, I had Delilah (whom I originally scheduled for in August based on the rave Yelp reviews, but she was behind so they placed me with Kennedy). All seemed well at first, we joked about not my getting a brazilian since late August with Kennedy that it would be as bad as a first-timer's wax. I had been quite busy the past few months and didn't have the time to, so I put off my typically-every-month wax. Let me start off by saying my first-ever wax years ago was great. Honestly the best wax\/waxes ever (thanks to Kris at Exotica Skin Care, she is amazing). I tried European Wax Center out of curiousity and as I said with Kennedy she was magnificent. The one with Delilah was IMMENSELY painful. I tried to suck it up and conversate but the pain was distracting. The conversation she was making with me seemed so forced and insincere, and she kept mentioning that I should never go this long again. She even showed me a bit of clumped hair she waxed off and said \"this was aallll at the top.\" Yeah, that didn't make me feel very comfortable at all. I felt a mix of awkwardness and wanting to cry and run out of there. I get it, I put it off for a couple months so I expected some extra pain. But not this much. It was rushed, I felt embarassed, uneasy, and the conversation was artificial. I've been to about 6-7 different places (I'm always on the hunt for great waxing places) these past few years, and had never ever had a bad one. They have all been great minus one mediocre experience, but other than that they've all been 4.5\/5 out of 5 in my book. This past one has haunted me in my sleep.    \n\nI hate hate hate sounding like one of these \"complainy\" bratty customers but it's my honest opinion and I hope it's taken as constructive critique rather than moaning. I would've given 5 stars if I didn't have that experience with Delilah, and because Kennedy isn't here anymore and isn't effected by it, putting one star is fitting, but even that's too much. I wish I knew where Kennedy went because as I can't stop saying I loved her and her work--SHE is 5-stars! \n\nThe woman who fixed, mended, and healed my soul after the monstrous experience from Delilah was Bertha at Bertha's Las Vegas Spa. So in case you had a similar experience, I DEFINITELY recommend her. Take a look at my review on her page!
