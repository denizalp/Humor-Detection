I visited Pho 88 on a recommendation from my sister-in-law.  Upon entering, my senses were flooded with the scent of mothballs.  Luckily, the adaptive processes of the brain helped me to acclimate.\n\nI had a Vietnamese soup and mango bubble tea.  Both were delicious, and the bubble tea was extremely smooth and creamy.\n\nUnfortunately, I visited again the next day for a bubble tea, and I had a very different experience.  It had fairly large ice chunks, which led me to chew it more than I drank it.\n\nI would still go back, but would make a point of needing the bubble tea well-blended (if I want ice chunks in a drink, I'll get a frap at Starbucks).
