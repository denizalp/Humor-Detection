OK, seriously WTF did I spend $20 on?? I can't believe I gave this place 4 stars last time purely on reputation. With my own reputation on the line, I have to take out 2 stars from before as I was truly unsatisfied from the meal.\n\nSince we did the lunch buffet last time and afterwards we read it's best to actually order off the menu at Lotus of Siam, my buddies and I ended up doing just that at dinner this past weekend.  None of us were wowed with the dinner and would just give it 3 stars at most for the dinner. After thinking about it even more, this place to me don't even deserve 3 stars.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n1) Thai Iced Tea: Something that really can't be F-ed up, and it's pretty good here.  Nothing to complain about.\n\n2) Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice: The fried rice had a strong curry taste, but lacked ingredients.  The portion was small, and had yes, the plate had 2 friggin shrimps and pineapples out of a can.  For $8, I expected more.\n\n3) Pad Thai: As the menu said \"It could have been one of the most popular Thai dishes of all time.\" Clearly a mistake since they probably meant to say \"It could be one of the most.....\" Anyways, usually I like pad thai at any Thai restaurant and the one done here is eh...so-so.  My friend was looking for the bean sprouts, it's like WTF happened to it?? Again, the portion was pretty dang small for something that cost $8\n\n4) Spicy Catfish: Very bland and not that spicy. The fish didn't taste that fresh and I was probably the biggest fan of the dish amongst us at the table. Definitely a bad choice on our part, but hey, could that be the case with all the stuff we got?\n\n5) Chicken curry w\/o coconut milk: It wasn't something we got off the curry menu, as this dish was on one of \"Siam's favorites.\"  Definitely, it was not a favorite of our's. The curry was watery, lacked in flavor and ingredients. Seriously, another epic fail in my eyes.\n\n6) Mango with sweet coconut milk sticky rice: Probably the best item we got that night. At $7.95, it wasn't cheap, but hey, nothing was really \"cheap\" here other than the fact we got a lot of bad food. I'll give credit when it's due. The mango was fresh and I liked the toasted rice on the sweet coconut milk flavored rice. Too bad we had to get 2 orders of this item since again, very skimping on the portions for the price.\n\nSeriously, over the course of the meal, I had this WTF look as I was eating. For what we paid and all the reviews of the place, I expected a lot more. Definitely more than what I had at the buffet a few months back. Maybe I'm used to LA's Thai Town or Siam I Am in Redondo's prices, but seriously, nothing was of any good value here. I know it's Vegas, but come on, it's located in this ghetto Asian strip mall. Pfft... Will I come back here again? Hell no. I could find better food eating at the Bellagio Buffet w\/o leaving the strip. This meal taught me one lesson. I will truly appreciate what I have in Thai Town and the various Thai restaurants I frequent in the South Bay.\n\nLotus of Siam = Epic Fail\n\n*Note* We were hungry enough that we hit up Echiza for the 2nd time in 2 nights. My favorite place to eat in Vegas, by far.
