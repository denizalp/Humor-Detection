This is \"fast food \"  Los Angeles style. I say L.A. because you see places like this\nall over... but what sets this apart from most is the food. Nothing mediocre\nabout it. The sandwiches are huge (enough for 2) and very tasty. The Italian was\nexcellent and would have done A -1 Imports in Long Beach,Ca. Proud. You can\nget \"bananas foster\". Deep fried string beans. I got this stuff home and opened the\nbags -- my sweeties ' eyes damn near popped out - the food is great looking but\ntastes even better than it looks -- that sandwich made me cry, for God's sake. I\nhonestly wiped tears from my eyes.
