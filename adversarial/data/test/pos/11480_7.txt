We will never use this Company again or the crook Justin Lich !\nHe intentionally took advantage of a trusting relationship- he is a thief. We trusted him because he had come well recommended from a dear friend, and  a couple of years ago he did a good job with a fair price cleaning carpet for us. This time around he was caught lying and charging excessively, but not until after he was paid. Don't do business with Justin Lich because he has clearly demonstrated a serious lack of integrity and will tell you whatever in order to charge more money and get your commitment. There are many good people and companies out there, but Az Quality Homecare and Justin Lich is not one of them.
