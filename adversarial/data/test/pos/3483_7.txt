I have made a reservation for 43 of my lady friends. I talked to the owner of the restaurant in person, several times and on the phone and planned the event to fine details. Everything was perfect.  Morning of, not afternoon, first thing in the morning I called the restaurant to let them know that 4 of my guests were not going to make it back in town and as a result will not attend my event. I was assured that it will not be a problem and that the server will relate the message to the owner. Owner was not available at the time.\n\nHere are my honest complains that I even wanted to tell the owner know but she refused to listen:\n\nI was told, without even asking that for a reservation of 40 guests \n1.The restaurant will be reserved and available for us  from 3pm to 5:30pm \n2. I have called to give a final number of guests to avoid being overcharged\n3. The attitude of the owner was NOT  acceptable!\nHere is what happened: \n1.The restaurant was NOT ready for us at 3pm. It was more like 3:30 pm.  I did not say anything at the time\n2. The restaurant was NOT closed for the public which resulted me personally and others to sit on a patio chair, very uncomfortable, ....my reservation was not for outside but inside!!!  \n3. I was still charged for the maximum guest which means that pretty much the fact that I called with a final number of guest attending did not make a difference for the owner, of course it meant less money in her packet!! I was told that she did the shopping for the restaurant and that was it!!! what is that supposed to mean?\n4.I was also told that she was there  to wash her dishes late and therefore there is not a refund for the overcharge !! what is that suppose to mean?\nI asked, am I supposed to cover out of my pocket the  charge, after bringing her business and great business in her restaurant !?! .....and that was pretty much it! The owner only cared for her profit, pocket and NO COSTUMER SERVICE! Hello, we are in the USA here:) \n5.The hats are gross and a mess and I asked if she plans to have more or in better condition for the event and I was told that they are donated and that she is open for more donations! lol my guests all had their own hats!!! If health department will look at the hats, they may have something to say about their condition and weather they are safe for the public use...\n\nThe place is small but nicely decorated, food great, and staff great but having this experience left me in a position that I told the owner, I will make sure all my guest, and more know of  her restaurant, she does not deserve our money, we pay her bills!!! and her employees by being there! Her response was : IT IS YOUR CHOICE .
