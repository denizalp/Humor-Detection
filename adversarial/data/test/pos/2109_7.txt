I was there on the 4th, to get my screen phone fix. But before I went in, I called and checked to see how much they will charge my phone, bcuz its cracked really bad (it's HTC Vivid), and they said its $49, and I was like REALLY!! THAT'S IT!? So I brought it in, but then the guy said it's  $65, $49 is for Iphone, I was shocked at the time, but eh! I rather get it fix, than complain like a bitch. i was feeling sad at first cuz my phone in the front is black, but all they have is white, but the guy was like if you want to be a lil different then get the white one, so I give it a try, after they done, it does look different, and I know I like it!, thanks guy
