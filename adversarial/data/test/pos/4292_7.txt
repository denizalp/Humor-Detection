After an evening of drinking in excess, greasy food is always a priority! Luckily for us, this Smashburger is open late and within a brief walking distance from Omnia Night Club inside of The Caesars Palace Hotel & Casino. They are actually in the Forum Food Court - near the entrance to the Forum Shops, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, and the Colosseum.\n\nThis would be my first time dining at a Smashburger and I was really impressed. We were served quickly, our food was cooked to order and to perfection; pretty awesome for a fast food joint. I really liked the sweet potato fries option as well. There are plenty of clean tables in the food court during the late night hours - so take your pick. There are also other food options open close by too, so your friend can grab a pizza if they're not down for smashing some burgers.\n\nThis is a great place to post up and people watch with just enough drunk traffic coming through to keep it interesting.\n\nKeep it classy Las Vegas! Not like you needed a reminder. :D
