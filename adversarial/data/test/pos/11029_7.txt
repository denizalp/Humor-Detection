This place is awesome to da Max!\n\nI started noticing this place in construction next door to my acupuncture for a few months. I checked for it's progress so many times that I finally gave up. Of course....until I saw other yelpers writing review on this place. BAM! I was here lightening fast. \n\nThe seating area is a bit small but doable for small party. Most of their drinks have coconut in it. If you aren't a fan of the coconut flavor, they also have other smoothies and drinks to choose from. At this point, they do not serve any food or snacks (which is fine by me). They have photos of their signature drinks posted on the wall. It took me a long time to decide which one to get. When my bestie,  Karen W, arrived, I decided to order drink #6. Oh boy was it good. It has plenty of coconut juice, huge chuck of coconut meat, 3 different types of jello, lychee and red Boba. I feel like I was having a party in my mouth.\n\nAfter drinking the whole thing, I was pretty much full at that point. I cannot be any happier to see that Chandler, Arizona is slowly becoming like my town Rowland heights in CA. With Boba place around the corner, Glazier snow across the street and now this delicious store for drinks, I'm so happy that they are all in here. \n\nI will most definitely come back here again.
