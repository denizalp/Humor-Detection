First of all: the customer service is absolutely fantastic here. As soon as you walk into the building you are greeted by more than one employee offering assistance. I was with my 12yo daughter and we arrived midweek around 3:30. The store was busy but well-staffed. Our immediate business was an appointment we made at Red Rock Eye Care located within Eyeglass World (I'll write a separate review for that). After we obtained our new Rx's we were ready to shop (please note they accept outside, current Rx's as well). There is a sign-in list so that customers can be served in an orderly fashion, but while you wait, you are encouraged to start trying on frames! The store is well-lit, clean, organized, and easy to navigate. They have frames ranging from $78-$200+, including high-end designer frames and sunglasses. At the end of every endcap is a full mirror so you can see how awesome you'd look in a new frame, which brings me to the best part. All glasses are Buy 1, Get 1 FREE (at equal or lesser value). This is not only a great deal but a relief as they have so many different styles and colors it'd be impossible to pick just one. \n\nAfter we picked out our frames, our optician - General Manager Tim - was ready and waiting for us to finish the process of selecting lens type, etc. If you wear glasses you know there's a lot of options when it comes to anti-glare, polarized and Transition lenses, and anti-scratch coatings to boot. These are all available and can be helpfully explained by any optometrist here. \n\nTim helped my daughter with her fitting first and was so great talking to her. It was her first time getting glasses and he could tell she was a combination of excited and nervous. They throw in polycarbonate lenses for free for kids - which is awesome - and I added 1 year of scratch protection for both pairs for $40. Even though it was a little after 5pm Tim promised to have her glasses finished for her by closing so she'd have them to wear to school the next day, which was greatly appreciated. Did I mention the customer service is amazing here? \n\nNext it was time for my fitting\/ordering\/etc. As a longtime glasses wearer I knew exactly what lenses and\/or features I wanted and Tim didn't pressure me to upgrade needlessly for higher priced materials or coatings like some other places do. He listened to my needs & wants as a glasses wearer and agreed with my selection. Further, he helped me feel more confident about selecting a different style than I'm used to, assuring me it wasn't too small for my face. I also made sure to add the 1 year scratch protection for just $40 - basically any scratch you get, for any reason, they'll take care of it free in that year. It's like insurance for your glasses. You hope you won't need it, but you know you probably will use it at least once. And don't forget - your second pair is free! \n\nAfter paying we still had about 30 minutes to kill while waiting for Lili's glasses to be done so we went shopping across the street and sure enough, by the time we came back, they were ready for us. With just a quick adjustment of the arms, we were off with her new glasses. She looked great as I dropped her off at school this morning (and I feel great she'll be able to see the board, haha!). I'll be picking up my finished glasses this morning, but I can assure you, I'll be back to buy more styles of frames. Not just because the prices are incredible, but because the staff - especially Tim - make wearing glasses fun! \n\nThank you for such a great experience!
