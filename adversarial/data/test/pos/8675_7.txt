The only thing sweeter than a Victorian Cupcake is sharing it with the perfect company!\n\nI frantically searched to surprise a guest who had a bigger sweet tooth than me and thanks to Yelp, I found the family owned Victoria Cake Company in Phoenix. Located in a mini-mall, this place was filled with an impressive variety of desserts and cupcakes which was their forte. \n\nFrom vanilla to chocolate based cupcakes to more gourmet flavors, I specifically came for their best seller \"The Pink Champagne\" ($2.75). The dainty pink cake was light, airy and topped with a pink buttercream frosting. The mild champagne flavor played in the background and was sweet but not over the top. After a few bites, I agreed why this cupcake is their must order. \n\nMy guest was a big chocolate fan so it was a no brainer to buy one of the \"Turtle Cupcake\" ($2.75) which was the top selling chocolate flavor. This cupcake was more dense compared to it's counterpart with chocolate screaming in every direction. Topped with chocolate chips and walnuts with a drizzle of caramel had this ranked more heavy to taste.\n\nWe definitely preferred The Pink Champagne Cupcake and highly recommend buying an extra one to savor the unique flavor. As I checked out, I noticed the customer after me selected the same cupcakes as me. Two for two equals a sure thing.\n\nThey also bake personalized cakes and desserts. The staff was very friendly and ample parking is located in front. The inside seating is very limited.\n\nI can't wait to cheers to the Pink Champagne Cupcake again!
