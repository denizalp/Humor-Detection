The food was disappointing - burnt toast, cold eggs-- the service was subpar, and the server was rude. I asked for milk and she said that the creamer \"milker\" was milk. Yeah, okay. I don't do creamer. I wanted milk and was going to pay for it. Also, she was not happy when I asked her if she spoke English. Her response was \"Well, what choice are you giving me?\"  sourpuss face included. I keep forgetting that in Montreal you don't ask that, you just speak English. My French is mediocre, and when I try to use it, Montrealers always tell me to \"say it in English\", so you just can't win. I don't think I'll speak fluent French overnight, but I also won't stop coming to Montreal because I just love it.  What I can do though, is not give my business to rude people. There are  plenty of gracious Francophones who understand  they live in a cosmopolitan city that attracts people from all over the world --  and are welcoming to those who did not grow up speaking Proust's tongue.
