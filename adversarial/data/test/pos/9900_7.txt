Location Location Location!! Right at Yonge and Bloor Subway Station underground PATH! \n\nOne of the busiest Starbucks location I been too... Not a place for one to chill or take a nap. Always a line up of people dropping in to pick up their coffee before their subway ride.\n\nWifi is awesome! Especially when you are at Yonge and Bloor and not sure where to go or what to do? Just log in here and you can plan your whole day with the Yelp App! \n\nWhere should I go for dessert after having my coffee?
