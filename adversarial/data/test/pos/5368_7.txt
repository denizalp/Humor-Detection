5\/30\n\nI have the worst time finding jeans. WORST. I've got hips for days that don't go away no matter how much yoga or 30 Day Shred I do. My waist to ass ratio is over a foot. My torso is longer than my legs. Ergo, I'm doomed to forever getting jeans tailored to fit me no matter where I go, unless I want a 2\" gap between my jeans and my backside every time I bend over and muddy hems. First world problems, ahoy.\n\nBootlegger has found the cure for what ails me. With their slightly stretchy jeans, I don't have to resort to buying a pair 2 sizes up that gaps when I bend or do the Asian Squatâ„¢. They'll last you until you bail down a mountain after climbing to the top, and you shred your jeans from crotch to ankle in front of all your friends (hey, I was hungover from wine tasting and I went HIKING UP A MOUNTAIN THE NEXT DAY). And best of all... Bootlegger hems any regular priced jeans you purchase there, free of charge! All you have to do is wash them inside out first. Reasonably priced, too. I generally find jeans here for around $50.\n\nThe staff here is really nice, and don't make fun of me when I subject one and all to my jeans-testing stretching and squatting exercises. Although, I'd probably make fun of me. But, hey, if you can't do those things when trying them on in the store, what makes you think you'll be able to do them in the privacy of your home?
