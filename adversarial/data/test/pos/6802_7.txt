(Lyrics - Deee-Lite - Groove Is In The Heart)\n\nThe meals that you fill in my mouth\nKeep me filled with satisfaction when we're done\nSatisfaction of what's to come\n\nI couldn't ask for another\nNo, I couldn't ask for another\n\nYour food, I do deeply dig\nBo Bites, only the best, my supper dish\nMy palates wish\n\nI couldn't ask for another\nNo, I couldn't ask for another\n\nGrassroots in the heart, Grassroots in the heart\nGrassroots in the heart, Grassroots in the heart\n\n\nGrassroots is a fancy pants southern twang kind of place.  Definitely a popular spot for locals and definitely a spot for foodies to explore.  \n\nMy group and I started with some Ahi Tuna Poke and the Pork Belly Pancetta.  I didn't care for the poke since it was fishy and the chips seemed somewhat stale.  The pork belly was quite fatty, but I like it like that; plus the thick bits of bacon gave it some texture.  The spicy tomato jam that came along with it made this dish pop!  For the entree I went for the Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna sandwich since I wanting some fries.  Lightly grilled ahi with condiments of butter leaf, onions, avocado, and a Siracha mayo.   Hands down the Siracha mayo made this sandwich a delight.  Overall, the sandwich was okay in my books.  I really didn't care for the shoe string fries; thought I'd be getting thick fat fries from the looks of the place.  For dessert we ordered the Key Lime Pie and Banana Split.  Both were pretty darn good, but nothing too special.  \n\nService overall was pretty good and on top of things.  Ambiance was borderline posh and some southern twang!  In the end, food was pretty good if you wanted to venture out a tad bit, but nothing to over the top! - Enjoy!
