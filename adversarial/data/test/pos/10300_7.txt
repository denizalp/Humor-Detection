I tried Panago for the first time a couple weeks ago when I bought pizza for my co-workers and I have to say it was a big hit. Normally we're pizza hut fans owing to the males in the group who mistake grease for flavour but this time around I'm glad we tried something different. The pizza at Panago is not ground breaking or uberly gourmet but for delivery\/take out fare it's pretty tasty. Better than bland Pizza Pizza or grease soaked Pizza Hut. \n\nThe pizza itself is remarkable in that it is not greasy or too doughy. Fresh ingredients and the sauce is decent and applied sufficiently. You also get a nice selection of dippers (ranch, cheese, hot sauce, tomato) with each small and above sized order. Prices are about the same as Pizza Hut.\n\nIt's also a BC chain too, gotta respect my roots you know!
