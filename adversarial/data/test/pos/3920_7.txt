Came today to simply use the putting green and chipping green and was told that I have to pay $25. \n\nThere were a total of 5 people there. I wasn't bothering anyone nor was I costing them any extra money. I play this course all the time but after today I will no longer give my money to this course. \n\nIt's not nice enough to pay money to use the putting and chipping greens.\n\nAfter this experience I drove down the street and used the facilities at the 500 club instead.
