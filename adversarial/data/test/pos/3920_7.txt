I can't imagine the town's actually talking about this place.  Actually funny story: when I was there it was raining and water was coming through the roof, the power went out, and they closed the place early, and the disappointed clientele got nothing, not even a free pass for the next day (after I asked). Now their dances are cheap: $10, but even at that I didn't get one.  The girls were always unavailable, usually hiding in the back room wrapped in blankets cause the air conditioning was too low.  The club just isn't run correctly.
