Just returned from Las Vegas and decided to check out Carnaval Court after we walked by it one afternoon. We were so glad we did! I have read the review about this being a hangout for \"trailer park, assembly lineworker trash\" and  I couldn't disagree more. Perhaps it was because we were there on a Wednesday evening, but I saw nothing of the sort. \n\nI sat at the blackjack tables for almost three hours in the rear area of the bar. I had a BLAST! The dealers (with the exception of Danielle) were phenomenal. They made the evening quite memorable. So much so that you really didn't even care if you lost money. The tables were quite lively and free-spirited which you don't seem to see further down on the south end of the strip.\n\nI highly recommend this bar! It was so much fun. The music was great, but I agree it was loud. But who cares about the whistles and the volume of the music after a couple of beers. If you want quiet, go and hang out at the Bellagio--you won't hear AC\/DC, Bon Jovi and Metallica that is for sure. You also won't find the entertainment value of this place. There was no cover charge the night we were there. The waitress service (including Elvis) did a great job. They came around before you were even done with your drink.  We will definitely be returning here during our November trip to Las Vegas.
