Don't bring your car here for work. Canadian Tire's service department is legendary for dishonesty:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canadian-tire-store-sells-questionable-repairs-1.879107\nhttp:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/w5-an-undercover-probe-of-canadian-garages-1.629214\n\nBut I figured, how could they botch a simple oil change and emission's test? I brought my car in on a Thursday for a LOF and my bi annual emissions test. Their emission testing machine was out of order and they were unable to do the test. I said no problem I can leave the car and pick it up Friday 5 pm. They suggested the machine would be repaired around noon.\n\nI called Friday 2 pm to inquire about the status. I was told the work was done. Great. I told them I'd be in after 5 pm to get the car. \n\nI arrived on time. They started to ring me out. I asked about the emission's test form. The person behind the counter looked a bit like I was asking her what blue sounds like. \"Oh, they didn't do the test.\" \"But I called at 2 pm and asked and you guys told me it had been done. Can I speak with a manager?\"\n\nThe night manager, a woman who should not lay claim to that title as she has no authority, said they'd get the car in right away (and waste my time). When it came time to pay the bill I suggested I thought the test or the LOF should be on them. $30 is fair compensation for wasting half hour of my time. The \"manager\" claimed she had no authority but offered me a $10 Canadian Tire gift card. I explained that wasn't acceptable. I asked for a $30 gift card. \"You'll have to talk to the day manager Joe.\" Uh huh. \"Okay, can I have the $10 gift card in good faith?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWait. I was offered it and now she was telling me I couldn't have it. She seemed confused why I was even dissatisfied. I started to work her through the process and she started to walk away. \"Ummm, you asked what the problem was, I'm trying to explain it to you, and you don't seem interested in the actual answer?\"\n\nJoe contacted me later and I explained the situation. He seemed unable to grasp my issue, even after explaining it three times to him. Like his night \"manager\" he simply walked away form the problem and refused to take ownership.\n\nCanadian Tire's auto service still has a long way to go in earning back the trust of customers after the CBC exposed their corruption. \n\nSeriously, find an honest independent mechanic and avoid this corporate cluster fuck. They simply don't care.
