Ok, Earl's is kind of whatever. The only reason I think it's thriving is because it's open 24\/7 for those Vegas club rats( Guilty as charged...). Honestly, when you're in Vegas you're either not eating or need a quick meal. That's where Earl's comes in. \n\nThe sandwiches I dig most:\nTUNA MELT W\/ TABASCO OHAYYY!!!!\nHOLIDAY TURKEY ( I don't think this is on the menu)\n\nAlso, it might be a quick meal, but be prepared to wait in line for that sandwich. Them breezies be crazy on the Earl's Sandwich hype!
