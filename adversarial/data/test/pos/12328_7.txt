Wow what a disappointment. Let me try to make this short and descriptive.\n\nFood: \nMediocre, items are hit and miss. Generic things like chicken fingers, poutine are okay. I came here last night and ordered corn beef hash it wasn't that great but it wasn't horrible. I've had better. Everyone felt as if there food wasn't hot and was more like room temperature. \n\nService:\nAtrocious! The diner had two servers for the night which honestly in my opinion isn't that bad as it was 4 in the morning. I've covered an entire patio and I'm an amateur. It took them ten minutes to take our order. Our food took 30 minutes to come there was no apology. We didn't have enough utensils and we had to ask the other waiter that wasn't. our to bring us some. My friend was served waffles with no syrup and our waiter never checked on us so we had to go to the front to get some. My friend ordered scrambled eggs well done and they came runny. When our waiter finally came back about 15-20 minutes into our meal. I asked if her eggs could be replaced and explained that we had to go all the way to the front to find someone for syrup and he rolled his eyes and walked away. He didn't come back to our table for the rest of the night. Another waiter brought her new eggs they were very well done and not scrambles they were actually sliced eggs (yes weird). We asked the other waiter if we could have our bill and our waiter came put the bill on the table and walked away didn't ask if we need the machine or anything. We waited 5 min to se if he would come back but he didn't. So we all got up to look for him so we could close our tab. None of us tipped him and we gave our extra money to the homeless man at the front door. \n\nP.s our server had an English accent for future reference. And tip: when you are understaffed or overwhelmed just apologize in advance and let your table know your name and to just call if they need anything. Also, make the effort to do checks so we don't have to get up out our seat and look for u.
