\"Second time I tried them, second time disappointed. The wait is long with no seating but more importantly work mediocre. Had them embroider military labels. Despite being specific and spelling name out it was misspelled! After the clerk argued, he realized and said he'd fix within 15 minutes. 45 minutes later I left as I had an appointment. When I returned the job was shoddy and it was clear they simply removed the transposed letters and the new ones didn't line up evenly with the existing text. Never will I return. The owner didn't even apologize.
