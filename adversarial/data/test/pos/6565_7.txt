Had to leave after seeing the bathrooms. \n\nFirst, sat down and gave my orders. Like the other people said, English is a challenge, but being a foreigner myself, I try to be more tolerant. But if you've been here for years and are somewhat young, learn the language. \n\nGot my appetizer: fresh shrimp spring rolls, like other said, with iceberg lettuce. Ok. Go to wash my hands, and the women's bathroom is disgusting. I mean, my shoes are sticking to the floor. No soap. Go to men's bathroom looking for soap (the restaurant is almost empty, and I needed to wash my hands), even dirtier and mo soap. \nGo to serving station where there is a sink for employees and then wash my hands. \n\nAfter all this, I had to cancel my pho, paid for my quarter eaten spring rolls, and took off to a brand new Asian fusion restaurant recently opened in the same business plaza. \n\nBeing pregnant, I can't afford to get sick. And I'm the one who goes to East Vegas to eat a tongue torta at a Hispanic supermarket, so don't call me picky. But clean is clean in ANY language\/culture.
