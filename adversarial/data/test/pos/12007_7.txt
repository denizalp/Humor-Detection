This Future Shop is located in the 10 Dundas Plaza and is one of the flagship stores. It has multiple entrances, one from the street and one from the main lobby of the plaza (up the escalators to the second floor).\n\nI usually dislike Future Shop when it comes to purchasing electronics. No points system for purchases, the prices are almost always higher than their main competitor and the staff is usually less than helpful (read: not around OR overbearing). I had reserved a few items online and when I walked through the store trying to figure out where to pick my stuff up, I stopped the FS rep that was at the main door and asked. She pointed me just outside the main entrance to a pickups area they've recently added.\n\nThere was a bit of a wait to pick up my stuff but seeing as how it's the holidays, that's to be expected. Once one of the reps asked what I had ordered, he was back in less than 2 minutes with my items, I paid and was out the door. Unfortunately for me, I reserved the wrong item so I had to go back about 15 minutes later and return it. Super super easy return. This counter wasn't busy at all and the guy even went so far as to look for the right product. He found it, but it was more than I wanted to spend, so he easily and quickly refunded my purchase. Whoever this guy was (he had an accent, perhaps Irish or something) was very pleasant and made the experience painless.\n\nOverall, this has turned into one of the better Future Shop's that I've shopped at and I won't hesitate as much to come here for my electronics purchases.
