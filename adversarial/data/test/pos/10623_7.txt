Wow. The annihilator is INCREDIBLE. It's like drinking caffeine flavored bliss with all the sugar you can handle. It makes the caramel macchiato at Starbucks taste like dirty mush. For real. \n\nThe service is lightning fast and the hopped up, happy baristas are really friendly, without seeming overbearing. If you haven't checked it out, you definitely need to. Delicious drops of heaven await you, just around the drive thru.\n\nSeriously, who the heck is Starbucks???
