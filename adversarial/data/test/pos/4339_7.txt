Quite possibly the worst service in the entire town of Mesa. Our server was young with braces and the one of the most air headed persons I've ever met. After confirming that I wanted my eggs sunny side up 2 different times she still brought them out scrambled like I wouldn't notice. The food also took 40+ minutes to get out of the kitchen. I'll never be back. Fudge this place.
