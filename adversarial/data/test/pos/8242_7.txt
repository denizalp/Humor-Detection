The atmosphere is a BLAST. It's like you have a friend with a rooftop bar. Just really chill & a big mix of people. We tried the nachos & sincerely it could feed a small fam of 4. The prices are Vegas prices & the portions are ginormous. I can't wait to go back to try a burger & watch a sporting event & just chill in the sun.
