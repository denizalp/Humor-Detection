Mount Washington also has areas that don't face downtown Pittsburgh. I didn't go that way, sticking to the railing and the lookout points that offered some incredible views of the city. It was a mostly clear day so I got some terrific pictures of the skyline and enjoyed my time up here.\n\nRide the Incline!
