MMM! Can you say delicious? You actually won't be saying anything because your mouth will be full of Pad Thai and the Coconut Milk Curry soup! This place was introduced to me by a friend who threw her anniversary party here and it was the best place for service!\n\nI absolutely love the Thai Tea and Thai Coffee they serve. It is a definite on the menu of items to try. \n\nI absolutely love the decor. Very ornate and very clean!
