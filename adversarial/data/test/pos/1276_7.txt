Took Megabus from Toronto (Central Bus Terminal) to Niagara Falls (Fallsview) \nBus left on time, driver was quite nice.  \nWifi looked connected but could never connect to anything on the entire trip, ended up using my cell phone data plan.  Others on bus said same. \nPower outlets did not work either. \nOn return trip (10:0PM) bus was 20 minutes late arriving and 25 minutes late leaving.  Called Megabus and they had no information.  When bus arrived it was not a Megabus bus, it was a single decker Coach Canada bus.  No wifi at all and seat power outlets not working.  \nCalled Megabus Monday. They said I would have to talk to customer service which did  not open until 9:00AM. Called after 9 off and on all day and got busy signal all day. When i finally got through I got voice mail.  I left my name and number and reason for my call. As of Wednesday morning still no return call. Called again, got customer service.  First thing they said is I had to contact Coach Canada..  I told them i bought my tickets from them not Coach Canada. Then they said they could nothing and that I had to email a special email address and file a complaint.  I ask what that would do.  They said they would send it to operations and investigate.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told a supervisor would tell me the same thing.\n\nHere is the thing: I could have gone on the GO Train connecting to a GO bus.  They do not have wifi or power outlets but they are $15 less.  \n\nSo Megabus advertises service they don't provide and cover them selves on their web page stating no refunds if wifi does not work.  \nWE DON'T CARE... WE DON'T HAVE TO\n\nI will not be taking Megabus again.
