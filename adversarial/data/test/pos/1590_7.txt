Wowza. At the crack of dawn I exercise. After that I'm famished. Thank goodness for a joint like Bertha's Cafe. (Which, by the way, is dangerously located across the street from my gym.)\n\nI Yelped for something that would be open, super close and offer food at 7:35am. This adorable place is located on the far west corner of a shopping strip. After quickly ordering the Turkey Jalapeno Egg sandwich ($5.95!) and customizing it without charge I enjoyed the indoor seating area. (Outdoor seating exists and is quite quaint.) \n\nSo out comes a beast of a sammie. The eggs are perfectly made for me. I love an easy over egg. (Check.) The cheese isn't out of control on this, just enough to give me tingles. (I like cheese, just not associated guilt.) A balanced amount of avocado with just a touch of jalapeno mayo. (I would eat avocado in my sleep.)\n\nDid I save half for later?\nUm, no.\n\nIt was divine.\n\nI came during an off peak weekday. Traffic was robust even at this early time. I suspect it can be tight to find a seat. However! Sandwiches can be quickly made to go, perfect for that office bite. Yummy stuff here!
