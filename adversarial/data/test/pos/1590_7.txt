China A SlowSlow.  If they were busy I would certainly cut them some slack, but the \"chef\" was busy messing with his iPhone, the woman behind the counter has zero people skills, and the food was bland.  The prices?  decent if the food had taste and came within an hour.  My advice?  Go in for lunch, order dinner, leave, come back.  I will not be back.
