I think I've been in the door at my place for 3 minutes. Came straight back from Farm.\nCorrection; Farm and CHRISTA.\nOK, let's set the scene: It's April 16\/2011 another stupefying, mid winter's day... yah, you read that right.\nAn additional slap in the chops from Winter. The last two years we've had two seasons. Winter and the last week of August.\nNow, I've been to Farm on a number of occasions, and was always pleasantly surprised. EVERYTHING is so, beautifully presented, and it tastes like nobody's business.\nToday they just launched a new Brunch Menu.\nTragically, they've decided to have someone well versed in Creative Writing  detail everything on the Menu.\nIt reads like a New York Times Art Review.\nOK? So try to decide.\nJust try.\n\nEnter: CHRISTA.\nImagine Julia Roberts giving it 400% while working your table like U2 does Wembley Stadium..\nIncredibly engaging, involving, attentive and friend-ly, friendly... friendly.\nShe's a master at the art of l-i-s-t-e-n-i-n-g.\nYou can get a meal anywhere you go, a meal like you get at FARM is a one in ten, but you load that with French Press Coffee and the single finest service I've ever had in my entire life, (*my lady-pal completely concurred), and they had to pull me out of there with a heavy lifter.\n\nThe food was superb and so enjoyable on such a dog-fornication day, we said no way, this just ain't gonna; end....\nSo?\nWith a Rebel Yell? We cried Mo', Mo, MO-O-O!\nOn to the Cheeses.\nDon't even ATTEMPT to navigate these.\nJust indicate some interest and allow Cap'n Christa to navigate you safely to shore.\nChrista?\nORDER for us.\nChrista?\nPick a wine!\nKeener than an Army Sharpshooter she kept knocking them down, one by one. All with pinpoint accuracy.\n2 Hours later?\nWe had NO choice but to head home in our two separate directions.\nHow the Hell can you top that?\nWe both tipped like fiends, walked out the door and started thinking, Geebuz.... what just happened in there?\n\nFood: Exceptional\nService: Always been a cut above until today.\nChrista elevated it from a meal into an EVENT. An EXPERIENCE.\nGawd luv ya' girl.\nWe're humbled.
