I absolutely DO NOT recommend this company. \n\nWe had troubles with them from the very beginning. \n\nFirst issue: I get a call from Jim regarding the location of the washer & dryer in our property. He tried to imply that there was a safety concern and it needed to be moved to a different location. We were of course very concerned for the tenant's safety and also for the property. After speaking with him for just a few minutes, I could tell that he was avoiding something ... when I finally pulled it out of him, there in fact wasn't a safety concern at all, it was the tenant wanting the washer & dryer relocated for their convenience. Now, I have no problem with a tenant asking for something and then the management company asking us for approval (even though they clearly saw the location of the washer & dryer before signing the lease and seemed to have no problem with it at that time.), but when you flat out lie to us, we have a problem.\n\nAfter that phone call, he told the other owner of the property that I was \"scary\". I never once raised my voice, or used any sort of inappropriate language... I simply got to the bottom of his lie. If that makes me a scary person, well then I guess I'm scary.... but not a very professional way of handling the situation, Jim. \n\nOur next and biggest concern happened just a few weeks ago when the lease was up. The lease ended on 02\/28\/2015, and the walk through between CR & the renter was scheduled for 03\/03\/2015. On 03\/02\/2015, I went to the property to make sure that there wasn't any major damage to the property that I wanted CR to address with the tenant. When I showed up to the house the tenant was still there. I received a phone call from Jim the next day stating that he went to the property to have the final walk through, but the tenant was getting his last few things, so he would return the following day for the inspection. I asked him what the tenant was going to get charged since he wasn't out on time ... Jim came up with some ridiculous excuse as to why he didn't think the tenant should be charged, stating that \"I wasn't able to do the walk through until Tuesday, so I was just going to give him those few extra days.\" Umm, I'm sorry, but that's not how this works. I don't care if you weren't able to get to the property for a month after the tenant moved out, that doesn't give them permission to stay there rent free until you make it out there!! We went around and around this issue, and he continued to come up with every excuse under the sun as to why the tenant shouldn't be charged for not being out on time. \n\nLastly, we were told that the house had been cleaned after the tenant finally left. Upon inspection of this, the floors were black if you ran a towel across them, the counters had a film on them, and all of the fans and high corners were covered in dust and cobwebs.  We called and spoke with the manager and she asked to give her a couple of days to get a cleaner out to the house. After several days had passed with no word from anyone, we called back just to be told that they weren't going to do anything about it. We explained that it wasn't done the first time, so they need to take care of it right away. We were then told that they would have the cleaner be in touch sometime that day ........ 2 weeks later and haven't heard a word. \n\nHow this \"company\" has stayed in business this long is beyond me. They are worthless.
