My steak mofongo was so flippin' delish that I almost smacked myself. It was packed with deliciously seasoned tender steak. The plantains were seasoned with garlic and were semi smashed to make a moist, but dry, crust. Not the bad kind of dry, by any means. He threw in a garnish of tomato lettuce and avocado with a dressing. The dressing was similar to thousand island without the relish and a bit sweet. Everything together was a hit! I tried the chicken mofongo also, and it was just as good. A friend ordered the tostones plate with chicken and the tostones were crunchy and flavorful. I hear that the college students come for the cubano sandwiches. I may have to stop back for one myself! I definitely will be back for another mofongo plate. Yum!
