I come back here for the third time and Tom, oh Tom. He's such a great help when you can't find certain KPop posters. As he's ringing my items through, he shared a lot of really funny stories with me and it really put me in a really good mood. I respect store owners that have a vibrant personality and always has a smile. I can't blame him though...there wasn't a lot of customers yesterday. Definitely coming back to buy more gifts for my friends =]
