Delicious coffee and it was my first cat cafe! The concept hasn't come to Buffalo yet, so I have to visit Pitt to see the glory.\n\nI came here later in the evening when it was too late to play with a cat (sorry whiskers!), but I did enjoy a cup of coffee and a delicious coffee! The coffee was delicious and smooth and they do pour overs. The cookie was super gooey and delicious too.\n\nLoved Colony Cafe! Hope to come back and play with an actual cat :).
