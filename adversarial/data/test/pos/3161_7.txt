This was such a disappointment! The service was so slow and you couldn't always understand the wait staff. When you asked them to repeat what they said, you now had it repeated to you with an attitude. The food didn't have much flavor. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and it tasted like a blob of white bread was stuck in the middle. I had the broiled pork chops and they were so overcooked you could hardly cut them with a meat knife let alone chew them. The \"Spanish potatoes\" are nothing more than kettle chips. The rice had no flavor what so ever. The wine selections are quite pricey. I will say that the dressing on the salad was tasty and the after dinner shot was probably the tastiest thing we had. We were extremely disappointed and felt like we should have just taken a match to the stack of money this cost us.
