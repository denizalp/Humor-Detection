I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this place before. I'm shocked and disappointed in myself. \n\nGelato Dolce Vita has been a favorite of mine since long ago (okay, like five or six years). I lived in Queen Creek and whenever I went to Mesa to visit my friends, we would inevitably end up here. Every flavor is amazing and the owners are super friendly. It really is the best gelato I've tasted outside of Italy. And, you know, even some places in Italy didn't quite measure up. Maybe I'm biased. Who knows.\n\nJust trust me. Check this place out. That's my advice. The end.
