This place is swell!\n\nTruly decent lattes, and reasonably priced sandwiches. Their simple grilled cheese is a College St. staple of mine, and I love eating it at their tiny wooden tables. If you're a sweets lover, this place will soon be your paradise. \n\nThey have free wifi and it's a real pleasure to spend the afternoon sitting somewhere that consistently smells like baking bread. \n\nPEPPER PLEADS TO THE PEOPLE don't give up on gluten or wheat unless you actually must. Get a grip, people! Carbs are divine, and your bad moods aren't worth the three pounds you lost.
