I ordered delivery from here.  My fault.  I should have as always done it through tasteaway.com and gotten the extra 20% they were offering but mainly because when i was given sh.t food I had some recourse.  Min delivery $30 AND a $4 delivery charge.   Don't expect too much and you might be fine.  Prices are pretty good for a lot of items but some are ridiculous like chaat papdi was a rip off price-wise but to top it up the dish itself was horriiiibbbbllleee and not even papdi as it is supposed to be.  I found this place to be very unprofessional and would go there under desperate conditions only.  Mithai was pretty good.  Parathas were awful.  Naan- awful (again not what is is supposed to be at all).  The overall taste is authentic which is a good thing, so when desperate for cheap Indian food I might still order here.  I think once you figure out some of their good items, you might be okay.
