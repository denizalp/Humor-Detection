\"I would rather have a cup of tea than sex.\" â€• Boy George\n\nI was super excited to try this place out.  I went over the river and through the woods [or maybe just past all this concrete jungle we call Phoenix] to come here and I was kind of disappointed. Some drinks were too syrupy (AZ Sunset... even after I mixed it. My boba also made it too murky for Instagram lol), others were too sweet and artificial (Taro Milk Tea), and then some had no flavor at all (Matcha Milk Tea). I didn't get a chance to try the Taro Float but it looked great. I imagine it would be hard not to get Thai tea right. This place is fine if you want sugar and artificial flavor but I'm an old lady that actually likes tea. With so many tea shops in the east valley, I don't think I wanna settle for the powder stuff anymore. \n\nI do want to give them another chance. The Mangonada caught my eye! The split cup is also a great idea for you indecisive people!
