Reviewer # 809\n\nWhere do I start?!? Well, first off, this place is so terrible its AMAZING and where else other than Vegas?  It's right on Freemont St in old town Vegas. This was my second time visiting HAG, but first at this location. I posted lots of photos for you to view. Walk in and get your hospital gown on.\n\n****CAUTION**** There is nothing healthy here. You will not find any veggies, diet soda, or meat alternatives. It is an unhealthy place to eat and caters to that. For that reason, I didn't eat anything when I was here this time, but I did in the past and it was very flavorful. I've been watching my health and wasn't going to let Vegas take that and my money from me! However, it was important that I take my friends there because it is oh-so-fun! \n\nIf you're over 350 pounds you eat for free. You must get up on the stage, have all eyes on you as your nurse says something like \"attention... we have a challenge to eat for free\" then people 350+ get on the scale. If you're over the 350 you are treated like royalty... kinda neat... kinda morbid... kinda not cool... kinda cool! What do you think?\n\nThey are in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most caloric burger. They have doubled that since then but the first record stands so they haven't needed to reclaim their place. Get yourself an IV wine bag, a juicy burger, and a near butter thick shake! You better plan to either walk or sleep it off, cause you're gonna be sleepy! \n\nBe sure to check out my many photos. Oh and make sure you eat all your food. Unless you want to be SPANKED!
