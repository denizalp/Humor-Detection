I've been a customer of Memory Express since 2003, when I first started buying from their Macleod Trail store. The Dalhousie store is walking distance from my home; staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful; prices are competitive with other stores even on www.shopbot.ca; and return policies are generous.
