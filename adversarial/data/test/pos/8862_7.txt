I'd been looking forward to coming to this spot since seeing it on Triple D and to also support my fellow New Orleanian.  The site was so cute & decorated with New Orleans fare throughout.  Tables were secure and it was clean.  There is also a grill in the front.  It is small but intimate. Servers were very nice.  Hence one star.\n\nIf you enjoy cayenne pepper & a runny nose, this is your spot.  I am from New Orleans, born & raised & I was insulted.  This food had absolutely no flavor.  Not only did it not have flavor the gumbo was uneditable it had so much cayenne.  It tasted as if the only spice was cayenne and no base in any smoked meat or flavor enhancers like bay leaf, smoked necks as the base, and garlic powder, onion powder, granulated garlic or anything.  Nothing I had was from home.  I also had the crawfish.  Sadly cayenne was the star.  The potatoes that they added to the boil were not boiled with any kind of salt. Ever had a boiled or baked potatoe without salt?  Horrible.\n\nMy table mate had the crawfish étouffée.  Cayenne abounded and no flavor.  She said the rice was fluffy.  Another table mate had the green beans & I'd ordered the greens.  Greens lacked anything & tasted like they came from a can.  Bacon pieces were obvious.  The green beans had a good crunch & a little flavor.  We also ordered the grilled oysters for our table.  They were seasoned with Italian dressing.  Different and average.\n\nI do not understand all the four & five stars here.  Palates are different but good food never changes and is consistent.  Lola's is a wanna be Louisiana kitchen.  We have a Lola's in New Orleans & I encourage every Yelper to eat there if ever in town.  This Las Vegas Lola is an imposter in the highest order.
