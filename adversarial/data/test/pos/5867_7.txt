Flashy Style over Substance... It is a shame.  We have been wanting to try Steak 44 for a while, we heard great things - REALLY  great things so were excited when the opportunity presented itself to finally go.  We arrived and were greeted by Lamborghini's, Audi R8s and a few S550's.  Walking in the place is LOUD, the kind of loud that makes you yell at your party to talk and leaves you with a sore throat the next day loud. \n\nThe staff - FANTASTIC!  From the greeter\/hostess to the waiters and waitresses - they were excellent, from start to finish excellent.  Professional, accommodating, friendly and very helpful.\n\nThe space - Very Vegas - not necessarily in the best way.  Some beautiful woods, high-end finishes, but Vegas nun the less.\n\nThe atmosphere - Lots, and lots of working girls - I love skin but YIKES - being gay I do not want to be someones gynecologist while dining at a fine restaurant.  \"Russian Talent\" was slurred from the table behind us.  Hot pants, tube tops and KMDFMP's are\/should not be acceptable dining attire for a restaurant of this perceived quality. There were quite a few professional football players with some coaches and agents.  Lots and lots of plastic surgery - enough that any of the Real House Wives of Beverly Hills would have said \"Wow, she is WAY over done... I need to go there.\" \n\nFood - Meh... I had an unmemorable salad, the prawns were way overcooked and rubbery.  The oysters were really nice and fresh with freshly grated horseradish and nice sauces.  Then... a horrible bone in tenderloin filet.  Supposedly this was a prime cut of beef, but it was neither prime nor tender - I really should have said something then but was so disappointed and starving I just ate it.  No salt and pepper on the steak, the baked potatoes (yes two, assuming they only got small potatoes in so had to make due) looked like they had been sitting out for a week or two and half-heartedly reheated. To be fair all of the other steaks were good to excellent.  But the lobster mash was greasy (not butter greasy) and didn't have salt and pepper.  The highlight was the butter cake with hot strawberry sauce.\n\nDrinks - Really nice wine selection if a bit to heavy on the overrated flashy wines.   The martinis were excellent and good beer choices.\n\nIf I could rate the staff they would get 5 stars - unfortunately the food was so hit and miss that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.
