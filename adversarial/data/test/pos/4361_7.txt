I often frequent this store as it is on my way home from work.  Petsmart has consistently good prices and excellent service. This one is no exception. The nice thing about Petsmart (PM) is that they have a range of products that vary from budget( although i dont recommend EVER buying budget food for your babies)up to more expensive foods like Royal Canin, Science Diet and Eukanuba. \nI go here to get my food for my two cats Henry and Boo and like that quite often they have deals if you have a petsmart card. You should definitely sign up for one, they represent great savings. \nThey have stuff here for dogs, cats, fish, birds, small rodents, and a great dog grooming salon ( I loved that I used the word salon).  \nThe girls and guys who work here are always quick to assist and will do a carry out to your car if necessary. Because I am a big strong strapping dude... ( well, sort of lol) I dont need it, but recommend you take advantage of it if you need to. \nLots of free parking out front. \nI'm a fan of this place. \nGive your pet a cuddle and pat from me!
