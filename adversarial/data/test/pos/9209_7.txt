It's hard to find a truly good Mexican food restaurant in Vegas, being Mexican and having tasted true Mexican food might set my standards a bit too high but I believe this is another example of a restaurant that just can't get Mexican food right. I've been here twice and the food ranged from extremely disappointing to mediocre. I tried the fajitas and the shrimp burrito the first visit there. The fajitas were nothing special and the shrimp burrito, which was very large, only had four shrimp in it. Four shrimp in what looked like a pound and a half sized burrito! I shouldn't have to start an expedition into the burrito to find the illusive shrimp. This just won't cut it, I was basically eating a bad salad wrapped in a tortilla trying to pass off as a burrito. \n\nMy second visit I had learned my lesson and stayed away from the food. My friend, not heeding my words, decided to order some tacos. And of course the end result was...... bland tacos. The tacos at Del Taco are more flavorful.\n\nNot all is bad at Agave though. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good drinks. They also have the largest selection of tequila I've seen and surprisingly good chips and salsa. At least they got something right. All this doesn't make the food taste better though so I can only recommend this as a place to get some drinks and eat some chips for the tequila enthusiast.
