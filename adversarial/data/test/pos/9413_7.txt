Yes, they're cheap - yes, they're roomy -yes, the room service is prompt and quick - yes, it's a nice change from being on the strip\n\nBut I would never pay to stay here again and this is why:\n\n1) I know room service is typically kind of expensive, but if an order of chicken wings is 8 bucks and a pizza is 4 bucks, my bill shouldn't be 20 bucks. I examined my receipt and there was a mandatory gratuity included. really though?\n\n2) They offer video checkout, and after you do it, the screen says, \"If you require a copy of your bill, stop by the front desk.\" So that's what I did, only to come face to face with an extremely rude man who sighed at me as if I'd paid my room bill in penny rolls, and said  to his co-worker, without even trying to be discreet about his irritation - \"This is what happens, when they check out in the room, and come down for their bill, we're the ones that have a hard time pulling it up.\" OK,  if it's so troublesome and requires that much of a Herculaneum effort on your part, how about not including it as an option in the first place, dick?\n\nIt was really embarrassing too because the dude was Filipino (like me) and I felt like I was getting chided by someone's irritating, old, cantankerous father-in-law. You know how when even relatives you don't know come down on you and you feel about an inch tall? I thought him saying that in my presence was unnecessarily bitchy. \n\nYeah, decent place to get a good night's sleep, but that's pretty much it. Peace out forever!
