I think I'm a bit too spoiled by Phoenix's coffee culture. I really wanted to love this place, it's quiet and has a pretty good sized menu.\n\nI ordered a Large Iced Vanilla Latte and found it to be just okay. Definitely caffeine filled as I got a large size, but did not taste any Vanilla. I also wanted to try a pastry so I got an Apple Turnover which was heated up and served to me on a paper plate. The pastry tasted like it came from Costco. My coffee and pastry came out to be almost $10, kind of pricey IMO.\n\nThe shop itself is small and very quiet the time I was there- considering it was just me and two other customers sitting in silence. There was faint music playing from what I recall. The parking situation is also not the best here, it's difficult to find parking right out front of the cafe so be prepared to walk. Unfortunately, I won't be returning to this small town coffeehouse :*(
