When all I need is a great cup of coffee\n\nLifeboat Coffeeis a great local coffee shop. They have great coffee and breakfast items. I just tried their Iced Americano and muffin  for the first time and both were amazing. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful. Meet your friends here and enjoy some of the best local coffee. You won't regret it.
