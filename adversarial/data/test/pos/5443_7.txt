if you want an pompous, rude know it all, that waits on you in between other customers ,than i suggest this is the perfect store for you. You cannot try the vaccums, just listen to him tell you what you should buy. We bought a riccar vacuum from him a few years back ,because of his suggestion and hated it .everytime we told him how bad it was he told us it was the best, and nothing is better. to make a long story short we paid around $550 and when we went to trade it in he said it was worth $50 which was bad enough, but when we were stupid enough to try to  buy a new one for $500 again he would not even through in a set of bags. we purchased a new vac from another store and love it .  buyer beware by the way i saved oved a hunded dollars at bed bath and beyond for the same vac.
