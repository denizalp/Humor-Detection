Had lunch here the first time with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon. I've heard about this place and wanted to try it out. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Eyes and I ordered the More Cow Bowl. \n\nMy More Cow Bowl consisted of Teriyaki Filet Mignon, Cauliflower, Portobello Mushrooms and Green Onions over Rice with Egg. The Filet Mignon was very tender and tasted delicious. The big chunks of Portobello and Cauliflower that they give you are delicious. They also don't serve too much but after you don't feel like you're stuffed. \n\nMy boyfriends Steak Eyes had country fried Filet Mignon medallions over biscuits with 2 over medium eggs and gravy. The gravy is delicious paired with the biscuits. The eggs were perfectly cooked and so was the filet mignon. \n\nThere are so many things you can try here, they also have fresh pressed juices that I also want to try. \n\nThe atmosphere is fun and energetic. Space is a little bit small for seating but luckily we were able to snag to 2 persons table.
