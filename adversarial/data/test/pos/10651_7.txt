Fabulous pool scene (at least to me when I was 18), with 3 pools.  One was generally relegated to the families who were dumb enough to live in basically campus apartments, the other 2 were for the keg parties and drunk pool orgies.\n\nDon't let the 2-star review mislead you. I didn't have any particular bad experiences here..I lived on the bottom floor and never got my apartment broken into.  There was always ample covered parking and my car was never messed with either.  The apartments are just kinda old.  I also never had any bug issues but then again, I am not adverse to cleaning.\n\nHowever, the negative points are for the leafblowers with their goddamned jetpacks that begin at approximately 5am.  Yeah, I know it's hot anytime after 5am, but why couldn't they do it later in the AM or even the evening?  Or never??!  I don't recall any of my neighbors and I EVER discussing how much of a problem we had with all the leaves everywhere.
