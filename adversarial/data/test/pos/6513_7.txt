Yes. I go to SouthPark Mall just to get cupcakes.\n\nNo, you will not judge me for this. \nYou will read this review and enjoy these cupcakes.\n\nThey're all natural and that's great and everything,but we all know it's about more than that.\n\nI have never had a cupcake here that I didn't fall in love with. \n(there was a cake pop that I'm on the fence about, but that's neither here nor there) \n\nThey're always moist and the icing is never too sweet. They rotate flavors every day it seems like so you can try something new every time you stop by.\n\nMy fave is the strawberry, it changed my life. They also have an espresso inspired one with a chocolate covered espresso bean on top and it's AMAZING.
