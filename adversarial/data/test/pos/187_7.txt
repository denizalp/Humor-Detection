Let me preface this by saying I'm a shy person and tattoo shops intimidate me greatly, this being said, my experience with BST almost left me in tears. I had heard good things about them and did my research and decided to go with one of their artists that specializes in text. I have a rough idea of what I want, but I am the least creative person ever and I need an artist's touch to be able to make my ideas come to life. I called ahead to make sure the artist I wanted was available and was assured that they were. When I got there, they were already busy with someone else (walk-ins happen, I know). I had to do my 'consultation' while they were tattooing someone else with 3 other people in the room. By this time I'm completely rattled and I'm sure I came off like a total idiot, but I felt like I was judged and completely dismissed. I was told to just email the quote I wanted in the text I wanted and that was the end of the story. I could've gone to any artist and done that! I have an existing tattoo and really wanted an artist to sit down with me and figure out an elegant way to work this quote into what I already have and give me input and help visualize the thing that will be on my body FOREVER.   \n\nI understand that time is money and they can't sit down and chat with you for an hour about a 'silly quote' you want on your body forever, but at least try to act like you're not just trying to take my money. Extremely disappointed in BST and now I have no idea where to go from here.
