When I walked into this CVS I was greeted by one of the workers! Nice! Usually that doesn't happen. I was, however, unable to find what I was looking for easily so they lose one star. Also, the water I got was not too cold - nor were the rest of the bottles of the brand I chose - so I just settled for the not so cold bottle since all were the same temperature:(.
