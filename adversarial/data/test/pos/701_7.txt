I've lived in this complex for 2 years now and have nothing but good things to say, I have never experienced any issues like the lady below me with the staff. In fact i have found all the girls in the office and the maintenance people to be extremely friendly and fast to dealing with any issues I have had. I would recommend this community to any of my friends or family.
