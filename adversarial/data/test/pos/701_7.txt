I've stayed at most of the nicer properties on the Las Vegas strip.  Averaging 3 trips a year to Sin City,  for the past 5 years, definitely makes me well versed in all things Vegas.  So when my friend decided to have his bachelor party in Vegas, I was stoked.  I'm always looking for an excuse to go... and when I found out we were going to be staying at Planet Hollywood... they didn't need to ask if I was going, just tell me when and I'm there.  \n\nStayed from Wednesday to Sunday.  I know I know... that's an eternity for Vegas. Typically, two days and three nights is more then enough; any longer, and you'll be burnt out.  By Friday I was pretty much fried... mainly from all the drinking sunup to sundown.  Anyways, I'm getting off the topic.  \n\nHere are it's Good Points:\n\n** Planet Hollywood is a decent size casino by Vegas standards. Even though they have only two mini-baccarat  tables, a table minimum of $25 for a weekend was fairly priced.   If mini-bacc is not your game, all your usual table games are there for as low as $5 min.\n\n** After taking over the former Aladdin, they've really given this place a face lift .  I love the crystal chandelier from the lobby escalator.  Catered definitely to the younger crowd, this place exudes a lot of energy.  A good amount of traffic inside the casino.\n\n** Positioned centrally on the \"Strip\".  A definite plus, saves you on cab fare.\n\n** There's a mall... provides plenty of shopping and cheap food court eateries.  Trust me, after 5 days here... I needed it.\n\nNow here's the Bad:\n\n** The standard rooms are over 450 sgft (good size for Vegas).  Linens are nice but I'm not a big fan of purple (yuck!).  That's the theme color at this place.  Each room has an article of clothing from an actual movie that's encased and displayed.  Mine happen to be the dress from the Exorcist... not good, not good all.  Creeped me out.  We also booked a suite.  It had an air hockey table... big plus.  Problem was the low ceilings and again, the purple decor.  What made this a negative for me was the price (average daily rate: little over $200).  During that time-frame, I could've stayed on a nicer property like Palazzo or The Hotel @ Mandalay for the less.  Oh well, ultimately we all wanted to stay in the same Hotel.  All-in-all, the accommodations has more good points then bad, it's more of personal reasons for me... \n\n** Their Pleasure Pit, a designated table game area with scantily clad girls dancing on stripper poles, is a uglier version of the Pussy Cat Doll lounge @ Caesars.  The girls are really not that ugly, just not as attractive compared to PCD lounge or Playboy Club.  If you're going to rip-off an idea... you gotta make it nicer.\n\n** Since they do have a night club (Prive) here, you get the drunks and obnoxious folks after 1:30 roaming the casino floor.\n\n** Don't have any fine dining restaurants, except for the Strip House.\n\n** Outside of the mall, there's no real attraction or landmark.  For example: Bellagio has the Fountains and the Conservatory, Mirage has the Volcano, Wynn has the light show, etc. \n\n** Their comping system is very slow and lacking.  When someone plays a minimum of $100 a hand and average about $300.  One would think you can get things right away especially when times are hard and you're starving for big players.  Granted we're no whales, but when I ask for something simple as having my cigarettes comped.  It took the pit boss over 30 minutes later to approve.  Took the the cocktail waitress another 20 minutes to get it.  BAD, VERY VERY BAD!  Also the pit boss was rarely rating the players.  Played for 3 hours at the table, the dealer had to apologize after she saw our disgust.  I never have this problem at Bellagio or MGM, I get it w\/in two minutes.  They definitely need to improve their customer service or they'll never have any committed gamblers.  \n\nAll-in-all, it's a good property.  More then likely I won't ever stay here again, especially after dropping a couple of g's here w\/o reaping anything.  Decided to spend the rest of my gambling money at Bellagio.  Planet is on par with properties that cater to young folks like the Palms and Hard Rock.  Modern and contemporary everything.  So if you want something centrally located with plenty of cheap eateries then Planet Hollywood is a safe bet.   Just don't gamble here.
