So after reading reviews I decided to go see what they offered.  I decided on the 75 minute\/$38 deal so many others have mentioned.  \n\nOmg was it worth it.  I was taken to a private room in the back rather than the big room up front.  They left to go get the supplies and just in the time I was sitting there waiting I started to relax - very dim lighting, dark purple furniture, and soft music playing - very zen.  Started with me soaking my feet while receiving a shoulder\/back rub.  Then I moved to another chair where I laid down.  She basically gave me a full body massage (clothes on) and a scalp massage.  They also included hot stones which are exactly that - HOT.\n\nShe did use a lot of pressure and it made me wince quite a few times but I kind of feel like that might have been what I needed.  Its 6 hours later and I don't hurt from anything she did but I have been totally useless since I left there.  I had to stop at Walmart after and it took me an hour to buy one thing because I was so mellow I just sort of wandered slowly through the store (and I'm normally a walking ball of anxiety).  It also made me nap for 2 hours and I've done fu** all since I woke up so I'm going to call this a win.\n\nI don't really get people complaining about the tip.  You got a 75 minute massage for $38 - and a good massage at that - why wouldn't you tip?  I paid 1\/2 of what Massage Envy charges even with the tip, and it was 25 minutes longer than ME.  \n\nI will definitely be back, and I will definitely recommend to friends.\n\nOh, and she gave me a card for something like Buy 10 get 1 Free but I'm too lazy to get up and go see exactly what it says.
