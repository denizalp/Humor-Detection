I am not one of those girly guys who goes to salons to get their hair done up, but those Serbian's guys at A&D Barber's know how to properly pamper a man! This is a man's shop owned by men. Would I like a beer while watching sports or a movie on their flat screen TV...hell yes I would! They follow the old fashion code of the barber; hair cut, straight edge shave, hot towel, and shoulder massage during every visit. I've been going here for roughly 5 years and will until they close up shop. Its nice knowing that no matter how busy Boris' day is, he will get me in. Even if he has to stay a little longer then normal. Thats true service! This place could only be better if one of those chick from the nail place next door came after I was done to really 'finish' me off. If your a MAN, not a girly man, you need to tell your current barber to F-off and go to A&D.
