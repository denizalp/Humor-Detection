Just like I like it, cheap and DIRTY!\n\nJAY KAY. Ok so Im a little thrift store junkie! Savers is pretty ok, not poop your pants awesome, but pretty ok! TIP! GET A SAVERS CARD! Here you can get extra little perks with a FREE Savers card! \n\nNow onto the junk!\n\nOk, so Im not a person who would wear someone elses yucky clothes. Nor would I dress my son in them. You know, second hand store clothes always have that smell no matter how often you wash them. Here I come for: Purses, shoes(kids sometimes BRAND NEW and the only time Ill buy them), random little crap.\n\nI HATE how you go to a thrift store and they price their crap SKY HIGH! Its like, you get this stuff FREE and you wanna charge me 8$ for some yoga capris that are worn? Get the eff outta here! I did find some brand new Chucks for my son for 2.50$!! They also have a great bag selection!\n\nIts all pretty organized by size and gender. They have TONS of clothing, shorts, skirts, dresses, capris, shirts, blouses, and THONGS! JK!\n\nThe kitchenware here is WAY OVER PRICED! You wanna sell me a dirty pan for 11$? Oh hells no! Come on! \n\nIn addition they have a crap ton of book, which a lot are new and cheap!\n\nIll continue coming here to fart around, theres sometimes hidden treasures!!
