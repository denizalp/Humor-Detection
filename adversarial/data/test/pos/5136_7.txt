Korean-style coffee shops are not common in this town and I love non-chain coffee shops. This is reminiscent of caf√©s I've been to in Seoul so I was pretty excited to try it. Nice modern interior. They have free wifi and multiple wall outlets for laptops and other devices.\n\nI wanted to try their macarons but they're not available. They don't make them here and they order macarons elsewhere and would take a few days. Since I live quite far from here and don't have the patience to wait 10 days, I got honey toast and what most people have been raving about - pistachio latte. Honestly, I was not that impressed by the pistachio latte and I should have had the green tea latte instead. All Korean coffee shops I've been to have latte art but I didn't see it on mine but no biggie. I haven't heard of anyone who died due to the lack of coffee art. But I did not taste pistachio in my latte. However, I did enjoy their honey toast. The toast was nice and buttery, lightly drizzled with honey and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Yup, better than Ichiza's version.\n\nSo the next time I'm in the area or if I get so bored and want to drive 20 miles, I'll come back here. Oh, let's not forget those nights of drinking and I need a pick-me-upper, this place is open til 2am! Yay!
