My husband had an appointment with Dr. Kwiatkowski (ENT) at this office for a follow up. The appointment was for 11:00 am. We walked in and the waiting room was packed. There weren't any seats available and there were 8 other people ahead of us. We sat there for 1 hour and 25 minutes and there were still three people ahead of us. My husband told them he was leaving and would not return. \nI do not understand why they give out appointments to everyone at around the same time and pack us in like sardines and make us wait. We were respectful and showed up on time, why can't they respect us? Our time is worth just as much as the doctor's. I am aware that there is always a wait when visiting a doctor's office but to expect a patient to wait an hour and twenty five minutes is unacceptable.
