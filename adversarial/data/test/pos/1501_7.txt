Where to start. I guess the beginning is as good a place as any, and so it begins...\n\nWe (my coworkers and I) just finished up a 16 hour day of work and were ready to check into our room for the night. We had booked and PAID for the room about 4 weeks in advanced. Which come to find out doesn't mean a thing. I guess reservations to them are only things that native Americans live on because they said they were booked for the night and could not honor our reservation.... Wait what?! Yes that was said, we had reservations but they didn't have a room for us. I will say it again, WE HAD RESERVATIONS BUT THEY DID NOT HOLD THE ROOM FOR US. I really don't understand the logic behind this. If you do please help me understand. But I digress. An hour later they advised us that they would put us up in a sister property that was (in my opinion) a downgrade to say the least. They also advised us they would refund the first room but would not provide anything saying that had or were going to. To say the customer service was terrible would be another understatement. The nazi guards at Auschwitz probably gave better service to the prisoners there than we got at this place. Prisoners who get their last meals receive better service than we did. They were as visually frustrated as we were. But it's frustrating to know this is a common occurrence and common practice with this hotel. It seemed to be run by a bunch of people who don't care about what service they give as long as they get their lunch in on time. Their manager was this fictitious being who I can only liken to Oz the great and powerful, who's only other role was that of the banker in deal or no deal. I'm beyond displeased, unsatisfied, and frankly disappointed. The staff at the Rio (which was the sister property) was helpful friendly and prompt with their service. \nIf you fancy an out of body experience where you feel you're on a 20\/20 downtown what would you do experiment on customer service that you only hope John Quinones will jump out afterward, then this is the place for you. If you want a seamless hotel check in\/out then go somewhere else.
