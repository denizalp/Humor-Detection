I saw a groupon I was interested in so went to the website to learn more.  I couldn't.  the web site had a number of errors and I couldn't get to the list of services.  I tried to send \"contact\" through the web site and it didn't work either so my only contact option was e-mail.\n\nI wrote the person and told them their web site wasn't working and what I tried and my perception of a business that is trying to promote itself but doesn't have a functioning web site (basically \"rookie\").  I pointed out the error and what I was trying to learn from the web site and why I decided against the groupon based on information I couldn't get.\n\nI received a rude e-mail back basically saying she was not a web site expert and she is reconsidering Groupon because of rude people.\n\nLast time I checked, customer feedback wasn't rude, it was a kindness to help a business understand how they can be perceived and how they might be able to improve.\n\nIf a business person that could be using lasers on your face or injecting botox or fillers or something doesn't want to listen to simple web site problems... why would they listen to anything else a customer had to say?\n\nI wouldn't trust my face to someone who apparently doesn't care.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate: 4-10-14  Today I receive another nasty e-mail from Kimberly Klepatz among her complaints was \"I don't even do injectibles\".  \n\nOK.... but because the web site wasn't working and had a huge phone number over the navigation bar, I couldn't find out what services were actually offered.\n\nAmong her complaints were that I was \"rude\" by telling her that her web site did not work properly, what it was doing, and what my perception was based on what I saw.   Now she's mad about the negative Yelp review.\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine someone so resistant to feedback in a service business.  It's even harder for me to imagine letting someone who won't accept responsibility for a simple error on web development at my face with a laser.  What if something went wrong?  Would she accept responsibility or just blame it on the customer?\n\nI am still amazed that rather than getting a \"Thank you.  I'm not sure what's wrong but I'll look into it\" on my feedback on the website I got \"I am going to reconsider Groupon because of rude people\"\n\nI need to check Yelp review policies but if I am allowed to publish a threaded e-mail, you would all die laughing!\n\nIt's kind of like \"Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares\" where the horrible cook is blaming the food sent back to the kitchen on the customers.\n\nReally?  \n\nAnyone ever see the episode of that show where he brought in the Yelpers he blamed for his demise?  They were all interested in giving the business owner honest feedback to *help* yet he wouldn't listen.  (I think he did when Ramsey nearly beat the snot out of him verbally... but I'm not Gordon Ramsey... just someone who know the power of active consumers.)\n\nI scream at the top of my lungs and applaud and promote businesses who do a really good job, deliver great service, have great food, etc.  \n\n  I also think that those who behave horribly earn their reviews.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4-10-14  10:24PM  I just downloaded 2 other browsers and sent 3 screen shots to this business owner to demonstrate the problem and isolated it to one browser.  She actually sent me an e-mail before I completed downloading chrome and testing it saying the web site was developed by someone else and she would give me plenty of contacts.\n\nWow.  Try to be helpful and point out a problem and suddenly you are being repeatedly called rude AND then try to be extra helpful and send visual representation of the problem.. and.... ???   I'm not actually sure of the intent.\nAm I supposed to be personal technical support for a business person that  kind of shredded me a new one?\n\nTruly one of the weirdest Yelp experiences of my life.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------
