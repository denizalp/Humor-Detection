I'm sorry. I feel guilty writing this review.  The people were nice, friendly, accommodating. But I have never been so let down after finding good reviews on Yelp.\n\nI don't mind that the location is a touch sketchy or that the interior needs some love.\n\nI did mind that the food varied from good to not very good and I paid 55 bucks for it.\n\nI did mind that there were ants...in several places.  On tables.  In the bathroom.  Deal with your pest problem please.\n\nI see why some reviewers say it feels like you are at someone's house.  That's probably why I feel guilty dropping a 2 star review on them.  \n\nFor the money, skip the buffet and go somewhere else like Palee's Crown, Thai Lahna or even Thai Rama.
