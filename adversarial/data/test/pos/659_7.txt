After two bad previous visits  & last night cheese crisp was burnt with no cheese, changed their salsa & not for the better, & hot sauce is now ridiculous hot, beans & rice dry & no flavor & shredded beef was like shoe leather with a burnt crust. Margs were still good so guess they have that going for them at least but something has definitely gone wrong here.  New owners? New management?  Or new cook, as we're often told if you complain?   Time to move on.
