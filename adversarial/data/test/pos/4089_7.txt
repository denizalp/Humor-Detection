Based on high Yelp reviews and recommendations  from others finally decided to try this place. After waiting in line 15 minutes I ordered the Italian Combo to go.  Waited another 15 min for them to prepare and off I went.\n\nOmg this thing was the same horrible sub you'd get at a Subway or Jersey Mikes franchise! \n \nTo start, what they call \"toasted\" is just warmed up.  The sub roll had the same yellow grains on the bottom that cheap pizza chains use to prevent their genius cooks from burning the crust. It's actually corn meal and should never be used on bread since it's disgusting. \n\nThe puny amount of meat used on their sub was laughable. I asked for Italian dressing and they must have barely put on a teaspoon.\n\nOk I know I should've just tossed this thing out the window but hated the idea of wasting 10 bucks. Took my first bite and it was so dry I nearly choked on it. That was enough for me, into the trash it went along with the zero-flavor, dried out  brownie I ordered.\n\nNo way I can recommend this place for sub sandwiches or deserts.  Perhaps the pasta is good but not taking my chances.\n\nThe only reason I can give 1 star is that their to-go napkins are nice and high quality (thank goodness too, I needed something strong and absorbent to hold the sub and brownie that I spewed  out).\n\nCiao DeFalco's!
