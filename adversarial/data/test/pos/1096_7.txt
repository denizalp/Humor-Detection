The teachers are great, the front desk personnel pretty good. But the school is almost a victim of its own success. It's nice, in theory, to offer make-up classes, but if all classes at your child's level (except for ones near bedtime) are full you can't schedule it. Additionally, you have only 30 days to schedule the make-up. So, buyer beware.
