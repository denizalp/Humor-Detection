Seriously, wth???\nThe \"Wal-Mart\" of Pho establishments, in my opinion.  (And that's being generous.)  \n\nCame in tonight (Sunday) around 8:30pm; less than half empty.  Took over ten minutes just to get greeted.  We ordered:\n\nAppetizer:  Egg Rolls.  Which came out extremely overcooked.  I asked the server if they had soy sauce since most places already have it on the table, and she said \"yes\", and just stared at me blankly.  I said \"well, can I have some please?\".  She left and eventually came back with it about 5 minutes later.\n\nBoyfriend:  Steak Pho, which he said tasted pretty bland.\n\nMe:  Vegetable Pho with extra veggies.  Broth was very sweet, and pretty gross.  I tried adding soy sauce, jalepenos, pepper, anything and everything to make it edible; which didn't help.  The only veggies that were in the soup were baby corn, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms.  Cauliflower? Really?  No bok choy, no cabbage.. Needless to say was VERY disappointed.  Being a vegetarian and having eaten at countless pho places, I was sorry I even ordered it.\n\nDaughter:  Kid's Meal chicken nuggets and fries.  She had no complaints, but then again, she eats my cooking.  Not very easy to mess that up.\n\nService:  Polite at first.  Gentleman that took our order and delivered our entrees was nice.  Orders were correct.  Then, he disappeared and we had no service whatsoever throughout our entire meal.  We were finished eating and were waiting to ask for a container and the check for over 15 minutes.  A young lady appeared and asked the table next to us (that came in after us) if they needed anything, as they were just finishing up.  They asked for a container, and the lady took her soup to box it up, and didn't even look our way.  Not sure how she missed us, because we were basically sitting right on top of them.  5 minutes later she brings them their box and check and walks away.  My boyfriend literally had to yell \"excuse me\" to get her to even acknowledge our existence.  We asked for a container and the check, which she brought relatively promptly.  AND THEN... we get to the cashier and she THEN informs us that it's \"cash only\".  I thought my boyfriend's head was going to spin around at that point.  SERIOUSLY??!  Who, in this day and age, doesn't accept cards of any kind?? While my boyfriend was at the ATM, I, at least, looked around for any signs stating that it is cash only.  ONE. One tiny, single sign stuck at the bottom of the window to the kitchen.  That's it.  So, you know, just in case the kitchen workers forget they can't use their card..  Fortunately, my boyfriend doesn't have to pay any ATM fees, due to his military debit card.  Had we had to pay a fee, though, there would have been a problem.  That is it for the rating part, but just in case you are enjoying my rant, below I will tell you about the farm animals sitting all around us...\n\nTables are very close together, and a couple was seated at the table next to us at a table for 4, and the server purposely put the menus on the opposite end of their table, so as to give us room.  Nope.  They move over right next to us, pretty much sitting in our laps.  As we wait for our food, chick next me starts playing videos on her phone at FULL VOLUME, so loud that we can't carry on a conversation.  Didn't help that the music was blaring in the restaurant, also.  Then, a group of 5 adults, one child, probably 4 years old, get seated behind us.  They all start hugging in the aisle like they've not seen each other in decades, and just continue to stand there talking while the kid runs all over the place.  Keep in mind, the restaurant is very small.  They finally sit down and are talking so loud and making so much noise, you would have thought they were at home in their own dining room.  All the while, they are completely ignoring the kid as she takes out ALL of the chopsticks (not wrapped, they were plastic) and plays with them, before putting them back again.  Gross.  Table next to us gets their food, and the chick next to me is slurping her soup louder than any CHILD EVER would.  It was ridiculous.  I seriously began to think that I was On a hidden camera show, or Punk'd, or something.  All around, a very painful visit from beginning to end. Rant over.
