I'm not entirely sure how I feel about Vic's. The restaurant is nestled deep in the heart of Anthem, and could prove hard to find if you are not a SCA resident. It is in the club house type building across the street from Walgreens. When we arrived it was eerily quiet outside -- my boyfriend said he felt as if he had just arrived to a Scientology compound. I concurred.\n\nAfter slight wandering around inside of the building we found the restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and led to a table in the corner of the restaurant with a beautiful view of the city. Our server was great. He was attentive and friendly without being overbearing. I ordered a glass of red wine and they served us a bread basket with three fairly plain rolls and plain ol' butter. I would take out the bread basket altogether if unable to either spice up the rolls, or the butter. Or perhaps offer port wine cheese in addition to the butter.\n\nAs our appetizer we opted for the Black and Blue Sliders ($10). They were two sliders with beef tenderloin, bleu cheese, onion, arugula, tomato and garlic aioli. The taste was fine, but the meat was pretty tough. I wouldn't order these again.\n\nThe entree prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The entrees range from $16 (Veggie Lasagna) all the way to $38 (rack of lamb). I was in a mood for a salad, so I selected the Warm Spinach salad ($11), boyfriend went with the Salmon ($22). The salad was fine and very rich. The portion did justify the price. I felt the vinaigrette was a little overpowering. The salmon was pretty straight forward. It was a generous portion and it was cooked just right. \n\nThe food was fine, but as a non SCA resident I wouldn't rush back here. I would have preferred to see a smaller, more refined menu and bigger taste. The items were just a-ok.
