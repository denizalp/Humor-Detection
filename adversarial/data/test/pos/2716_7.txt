Walked in to an empty restaurant, that should have been my first sign. \n\nWorst sushi I have ever had and they server was so rude, I actually left 0 tip! They counted our shrimp and complained because there was two left.\n\nThe waitress stood in the empty restaurant staring at you table the whole time ( see photo )
