Look, bad experiences happen to everybody sooner or later. Sometimes customers are rude and won't acknowledge it. Other times, employees have a bad day and don't handle situations appropriately.\n\nBut I have to say, after having flown United on the last four trips I took - three of them multi-leg international trips and one of them a direct flight coast-to-coast - I gotta say that United is just an awful airline.\n\nPlanes - decrepit and worn-out. Old. Every last one of them that I was on, was from the 1980s. In-flight entertainment which was primitive; playing a single movie for everyone from a Hi-8 videotape. That's just sad. Fortunately, it's the 21st century (everywhere but on United flights) so I can bring an iPod and watch a movie with my earbuds (but I can't plug it in to keep it charged!!! Because this is United - christ, the AC outlets in the lavatories don't even work. Psych!)\n\nFlight attendants - CLEARLY hate their jobs and the customers, ALL of them. Well, except of course if they think you are a rich sugardaddy who can rescue them from their shitty jobs. I am painfully polite at all times to people who have to deal with the general public, I know it can be hard and you often can't tell people what they really deserve to hear. \n\nIt must be said that United flight crew are equal opportunity, they are rude to EVERYONE whether passengers are polite and as undemanding as possible, or whether they act like rude, clueless jerks.\n\nI saw one flight attendant pick up a newspaper someone had put under his seat (in flight, it had slid into the aisle) and THROW IT into the lap of the passenger, as if he had purposely put it there to annoy her and ruin her day.\n\nOn several occasions, I've tried to make a little small talk with a United attendant - not to hit on them or flirt with them, just friendly banter. Each and every time, I got treated like I'd offered them a handful of shit. The attitude was very clear, 'don't fucking bother me; I hate you, I hate my job, I hate every fucking person on this plane.'\n\nWell guess what you dumb twat: I'm sorry they've slashed your pay and increased your workload, but I don't like flying your piece of shit airline either. None of us want to be here, but I'm trying to make the best of it. Is it too much to ask you to do the same? I mean, if you are going to treat me like this, I might as well treat you like shit too. Maybe I'll go back to my seat and needlessly ring you over. At least that way I will have EARNED your hateful, imperious attitude.\n\nSeating- UNCOMFORTABLE. Barely enough room for my legs, and while I am slightly on the tall side, I am thin not fat. Should not have had an issue with this!\n\nDuring a couple of these international flights, I had legs which were NOT United. BIG difference. Modern, clean airplanes with modern in-flight entertainment systems. Friendly flight attendants. Adequate leg room.\n\nThe only good things I can say about United is that they did get me to my destination safely and my bags did show up, undamaged. I guess I should count my blessings. Nevertheless, I'm avoiding United whenever possible.
