This used to be one of favorite places so after a while of not having lunch there I decided to go for my birthday. I was more than disappointed. The concept that u so much loved had changed completely. They no longer brought out and made the sauce at your table. When I asked I was told that corporate changed it to by request only. Despite requesting it I never got it. No sugar for my ice t and the food was not the same. Needless to say I will not be returning to this chain anymore. Corporate strikes again. So long PF Changs.  It was a good run while it lasted.
