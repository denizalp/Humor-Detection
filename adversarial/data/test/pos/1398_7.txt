I'm not hard to please. And I rarely post reviews. This place however, is NOT Italian food. This is southern food trying to be Italian. The atmosphere is inviting, the service was a little to be desired, that is if you could find your waitress, I will give you a hint, when you hand off the check don't disappear for 15 mins. I had chicken parm and it was like someone poured chef boyarde sauce on top of country fried chicken. I was first enticed because of how the place was packed full of people every weekend, and when I finally left I was mostly confused. On a scale of 1-10 with just the food I make at home being a 10. This stuff is a 2. Would not recommend. Would enthusiastically caution anyone from going. Stay at home and eat a hot pocket, better bang for your buck.
