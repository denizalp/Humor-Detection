For an hour of tour, Neon Museum gives you the history of Las Vegas pretty much. How it started, why is started, and where the city is at now today. \n\nThey're all not lit. But it's okay, hence the name boneyard. All signs are majority dead. Well, a few were lit. \n\n$18 for NV residents, $25 for others (this is for the night tour, which I highly recommend doing the sunset one - 4 pm in the winter).\n\nBook online, print and head over. 5\/5!
