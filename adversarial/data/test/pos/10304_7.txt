The wife and I were in town for a trade show and my boss got us a suite at the Cosmo. I had never been there before but it was really nice. \n\n\nS t r i p  L o c a t i o n\nI like the location of the hotel. It was pretty close to the Plant Hollywood, Aria, Belliago which makes things easy, no buses, monorails or taxi's. Stoked.\n\nP a r k i n g \ngarage takes you right to the main lobby.\n\nR o o m  \/  S u i t e \nMy suite was beautiful it has wet bar, living room\/office. 2 flat screen tv's. Pretty large bathroom with big square tub. It really was too much for me but i shouldn't complaint because it was free.\n\nR e s t a u r a n t s\nI liked the fact that the hotel has 14 restaurants. There would be no reason to go anywhere else if everything is right where your staying. It was very convenient. We ate a Hoilstiens & Blue Ribbon Sushi. Both really good and I will leave my reviews for each on there page. \n\nC a s i n o\nThe casino was huge. I didn't really have any time to play any of the games but the place was always packed. \n\nOverall the hotel was really nice and i think next year when we are in town i am going to request we stay at the Cosmo again. We just loved every bit of this hotel. No complaints. \n\nThanks for Reading\nMatthew Y.
