*sniff* I can't believe I was made to cry (on the inside) no less on New Year's Eve. My hubby and I came here thinking we would split a burrito since I know how big the burritos can be at Chipotle.  \n\nWe waited in line. I watched the two guys in front of me each get 2 tortillas each for their burrito and the girl behind the line really piled on the rice, beans, and their choice of meat. I was thinking, wow, these burritos are even bigger than what I remembered. \n\nThen when it came my turn for my burrito, the girl behind the counter took one look at petite me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpy serving of rice, beans, and seriously like 5 pieces of meat. I felt so crest fallen.  I looked at the measly portion that was going to be my burrito, I looked at the girl behind the counter and asked why the two guys in front of me got such massive burritos but not me. She just rolled her eyes at me and went on to the next costumer. \n\nBoy, was I disappointed. And I checked too with those two young guys in case they paid extra for their mega massive burritos. Nope, same price as what I paid. \n\nI seriously wanted to take a photo of my burrito next to theirs cause mine would look like the runt of the litter. It was so pathetically so much smaller in size. \n\nI thought maybe it was an off night but from reading the other reviews, many other customers have received the same uneven service. \n\nChipotle corporate, you should take note since as corporate you take such pride in providing a good product and service- that is the Chipotle brand and signature. \n\nWell, this particular location is not making the grade. \n\nAnd *sniff* now I know what being an unwanted stepchild feels like. *sniff*.
