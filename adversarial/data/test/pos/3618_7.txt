The guy behind the counter was super friendly.  Dare I say flirty?  Hopefully so, since I was flirting.  And it's an embarrassment when you are flirting alone.  Ahem!  Errr....awkward situation aside....\n\nPetite Thuet is not bad, but it's not perfect either.  I give it a wholehearted \"meh\".  I purchased four macarons at $1.95 each in pistachio, strawberries & cream, lemon, and coffee.  No wait, hazelnut.  Caramel?  Well it's brown coloured....something?  Yeah, dude had no idea what the brown was.  It tasted like Tiramisu, so I'll stick with that.  The lemon was crusted with yellow sugar, which was totally uncalled for.  A macaron is sweet enough!  And one out of the four macarons wasn't too fresh. A-okay, but I won't be making a trip back anytime soon.  Not even for the dude's phone number.
