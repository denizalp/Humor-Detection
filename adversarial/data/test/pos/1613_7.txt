The locals scene in Vegas has been going through a \"renaissance\" as of late. There are more business' that are being created to appeal to the foodies, as well as the uniqueness that this city has to offer, with its diverse clientele. This has to be the most unique pastry shop in all of Vegas. They specialize in Asian (particularly Japanese) style pastries. I've been here many times, having tried almost all the sweets here, and most of the items I have tried have been fantastic. This time, I came here with a bunch of yelpers at  Nelson's UYE event.\n\nSuzuya is located behind the Jiffy Lube in a strip mall, off of the 215 and Durango, heading west. You'll see the sign \"pastries and crepes\" off the road, and turn in there.  (if you went past the Sonic Drive Thru, you've gone too far). The parking lot is shared with the other business', but I have never had trouble finding a spot to park.\n\nOnce going in, I was immediately greeted by Chef Misuzu and her staff. The pastry chef Misuzu has had an impressive career, working in some of the best 5 Star 5 Diamond establishments including Alex at the Wynn, and the Aria Resort. And if her green tea cake looks familiar to you all, before opening up her own shop, she was also the pastry chef of the Mon restaurant group (Kabuto, Goyemon, Sushi Mon).\n\nThere are tables set up with chairs and wooden benches. This store is kept immaculate. On the service counter there are crepe machines, pastry display cases, a drink station, and a register. Over near the crepe machines, there is a list of crepes that you can order. Don't forget to look above the pastry display case, there are apple pies and tarts available. Order from the display case. Next to the pastries is a refrigerated case, where they keep cold drinks, many of them Japanese made, available. After ordering, I sat down and let them deliver my goods too me, since there was a big line. \n\n(Note: While Misuzu keeps a lot of customer favorites in stock, she also changes up her desserts, showcasing the seasonality of her pastries, her creativity and the team)\n\nAnmitsu - This popular japanese dessert is one we don't see very often in America. Suzuya's version uses an agar jelly, red beans, fresh fruits, and tofu mochi which gives it a nice chew. I liked the caramel syrup you can pour on top, and it goes well with green tea ice cream. \n\nApple Pie - Wow, what a great take on a classic. This one uses a puff pastry-like crust, giving it a extremely flaky texture. The fuji apples used hold their shape well, and the entire dessert is well balanced. Make sure to ask for it warmed, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\n\nTofu Cheesecake - This was probably my least favorite item. While the cheesecake was light and properly made, for my personal preference, it was hard for my palette to get this one, from the tofu. But, others' liked it, so who am I to say?\n\nRum Raisin Shortbread Sandwich - These little treats were quite delectable. Crumbly, buttery, sabl√© biscuit sandwiches with rum raisins. The filling was sort of a buttercream, but denser and less buttery, I couldn't figure out what it was, but it was terrific.\n\nB.A.T. (Bourbon Bacon, Arugula, and Sun Dried Tomatoes) Crepe - Even If you're not a big fan of desserts, I urge you to come and try the crepe's at Suzuya, whether sweet or savory ones. These are phenomenal. It is safe to say that the crepe shells themselves.. the best in Vegas. They are sturdy enough to hold the fillings, but once you eat them, they melt in your mouth, letting the fillings shine. This savory crepe is made with bourbon bacon, arugula, avacado, and sun dried tomatoes. All the flavors go extremely well together, and balance out each other. It kept me interested, and wanting more. I could eat 12!!!\n\nI like good pastries... and I LOVE great pastries. Suzuya is a great pastry shop, with a fantastic staff, wonderful food, and a comfortable setting. They are open 10am - 6, every day except Tues. Come try this place out, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have.
