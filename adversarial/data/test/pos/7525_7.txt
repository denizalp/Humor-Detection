I like this place because of all the old signage and memorabilia. Real coke signs and machines, it's a museum then a jean store to me. It feels so well done, almost like it's not authentic. But it is, and it all belongs to the owner - who must be making a killing because the jeans are expensive as fuck. I got an awesome hat that says Only New York on it; no PGHers were buying it so it was really cheap.
