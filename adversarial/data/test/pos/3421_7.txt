We went to their $35\/ person brunch on Sunday. \n\nSo, ok, it's a 3 1\/2 stars. #1 because of the service... This is the second buffet we went this weekend that we were like... \"What the heck?!?\" [on the service]! \n\nThe Wicked Spoon doesn't have self service drinks (aside from a juice in the buffet area) so waiting through an entire plate just to be greeted for a drink, let alone RECEIVING it well into our second plates was more than disappointing. My boyfriend and I are religious water drinkers and to have paid almost $80 bucks for brunch with no drinks for that amount of time was disappointing to say the least. And then she just brought the one carafe of water which we went through immediately and was never refilled!!! Even after several requests! Not to mention that we literally had to push the used plates to the side for the entire meal! (That was pretty gross)\n\nBut onto the food... It was good. And inventive. I loved the small plates so you could try multiple items. That was something we particularly enjoyed at this Vegas buffet. \n\nHe\/ I enjoyed the vanilla infused beets, the shiracha wings, saffron salmon, and the carved meat. My bf liked the eggs benedict, fruit\/yogurt parfait, carved meat, pesto gnocchi. \n\nThe deserts were also by far better than any place we have been.... We don't really like sweets so it's just an observation on our part. \n\nNo real seafood here. There was sushi which looked okay. I didn't try it when we went. And then they also had steamed clams. \n\nAll in all ok. The service was the deal breaker for us. We would rather go to any sit down restaurant and have an attentive server (for the same price or less) than be ignored after paying that amount. \n\nWe were super excited after reading the reviews and then we were very deflated by our actual experience this weekend.  \n\nAnd if you want all you can drink champagne (for two hours) it's an additional $15\/person.
