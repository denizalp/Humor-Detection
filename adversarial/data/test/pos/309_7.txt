We love this mall! We would definitely make the half an hour drive from Summerlin, even though there's a Meadows Mall not too far from us. The mall (even the immediate surrounding area) can entertain us for an entire day. I love that there is a Costco right next door, so we can gas-up and shop-up there as well. \n\nThe inside of the mall is bright, huge, and it's also clean. It looks like it's been newly remodeled and still going through some minor renovations on the outside. It doesn't seem like it gets to too crowded here, we typically snag ideal parking spots in the front, near the entrances. I enjoy that it's quieter here, I relish in privacy and personal space when I shop.\n\nThis mall has a great selection of large department stores that we frequent. My boyfriend and I easily spent over 5 hours shopping here. Not to mention, all of the employees that we have interacted with here so far are all so warm and helpful. These stores were all surprisingly clean and well stocked:\n- Dillard's\n- Macy's\n- JC Penny\n- Khol's\n\nTheir Food Court isn't that huge, but it has a few goodies:\n- Dairy Queen \/Orange Julius \n- Sbarro\n- Hot dog on a stick\n- Panda Express \n- Chevy's\n- Red Robin\nThey also have my personal favorites Starbucks and Auntie Anne's for the mid-shopping-spree-snack-attack. \n\n(There's a few more restaurants\/eateries  (Japanese, Greek, Mexican, subway, etc) but I only detailed the ones I would eat at...lol) \n\nWe haven't spent too much time walking inside of the mall, except for the department stores, but we would still quickly recommend this mall for anyone trying to kill time or actually looking to spend some dough.
