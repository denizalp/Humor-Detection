Recently I went into this establishment to have my brakes checked, because I had read an ad that said their mechanics are  paid by the hour and not by commission, so they won't sell you stuff you don't need.  So I went in and and had a brake inspection done and was told that my front calipers on my truck were sticking and that I would need to replace them and I would also need new pads and it would all cost about $580.00.  As I didn't have that kind of money, I decided to get a 2nd opinion.  I went to ATAC on the corner of Recker and Baseline and had them do an inspection and was told I needed 2 new brake pads on the front of my vehicle, and it would cost about $150.00.  I asked if there was anything wrong with the calipers and their mechanic told me they were fine.  They did the repair and my brakes work great.\n\nI just want to warn everyone that is is always good to get a 2nd opinion.  In my case it saved me $430.00.    Also, don't believe Brake Masters ads...
