For the record.... I order my burgers with meat & bun only... (I'm a weirdo) so I can't speak about the toppings even though there were many and the people I was with loved them all. \n\nI ordered a small burger, plain, and my bf and I split a small fry - which was more than enough for the both of us. The burger was very juicy and well-flavored. The fries were absolutely delicious! I loved the free peanuts and I thought the decor was pretty cool. It reminded me of a barn or a farmhouse. Everything was pretty reasonably priced and I was impressed overall. I would be willing to say it was every bit as good as In N Out although In N Out is far cheaper. My boyfriend said it was second best to The Habit - which Vegas doesn't have, so it looks like we'll be coming to Five Guys often.
