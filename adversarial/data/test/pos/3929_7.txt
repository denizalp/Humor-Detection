9\/29\n\nOh yeah, I'll be back!  \n\nSo what if this place was practically dead when I arrived at 4:30pm?  And so what if it took me two times to ask for some table bread, which didn't arrive till after I'd placed my 2nd appetizer order?  Or that the glass of Primitivo Mediterranean red was a bit disappointing?  Oh, no.  I was captivated after my first bite of the Asparagus bruschetta!  By the second bite, I was knee-deep in quicksand and succumbing to sweet surrender.  Sweet, roasted red pepper surrender.  On a bed of creamy, luscious, and lust-provoking goat cheese.  I was so transported by this dish that I wasn't satisfied with just one... No, no.  I had to have another!  And yes, if you must know, I ate it all =)\n\nOh, and the table bread?  I sampled a thumb-twist of the honey-whole wheat, and it, too, was delicious.  I took the rest home, and I'm unhappy to say that not a crumb of it was present 24 hours later (no thanks to my roomie).
