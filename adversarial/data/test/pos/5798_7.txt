Mommy\/daughter day. Went for haircuts nearby and my 10 year old decided to give Jewish deli a try. While we loved the food, the service was awful. Got the early bird special of a corned beef ruben (they split it in the kitchen for us) and I asked to add a bowl of soup (the early bird menu states it is $1.95 to add soup or salad). I asked if the matzo ball soup was available for that. Ended up being charged full price ($4.50) because the server didn't \"understand\" me. Shared the blintzes for dessert. Yum!\nAll the savory items needed seasoning, but in our area (many seniors) most places under salt. This was no exception. No problem, there is salt on the table. My 10 year old is now a covert to Matzo ball soup!\nOur server ignored us most of the time. We sat with our menus closed in front of us for over 10 minutes. Our server only had 1 other table. I paid $2.50 for an iced tea that was never refilled. When our bill turned up wrong, it took me almost 10 minutes to get her attention as she never looked over to our table. Then she ARGUED with me about it. It was my first time there and I knew more about the menu than she did! Finally she said she would pay the difference out of her own pocket. That's a nice way of saying she didn't want to get caught making a mistake. I asked for the manager.\nI am generally a really good tipper. I've been a server and\/or server trainer for most of my life. When I got the bill, under tip I wrote, \"get a different job\".\nI would eat there again, but not with that server or I'd get my food to go.
