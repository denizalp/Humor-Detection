6 yelp stars!\n\nRussian \/ Eastern European Candy Specialist ! ! ! !\n\nIf I combined all 7 of the Russian Markets I have visited. this place still has more Candy Variety!  I had never had Vodka in Chocolate and it was Delicious!!!\n\nIce Cream!  Very sorry I did not take a photo of this IceCream it tasted like ButterCream!  So Many I have never seen before!\n\nMeat Case looked Fantastik!\n\nWhen I lived in Charlotte (2003-2013) Union County had a Large Population of Ukrainians and Russians so it would make sense to have some Russian Markets here!
