This Cinnabon was calling my name miles away. I'm sensitive to gluten and try to stay away but as soon as I got off the tram into the Terminal D, I was done for. The smell of Cinnabons filled the air and my heart was set before I even made it up the escalator. The original is deadly enough. No thanks on the extra caramel, pecans and caramel frosting. That must be the diet version. Way to sweet for me! Funny enough, the original doesn't seem as small as I used to think. They have these awesome little Cinnabon mini's now- 6 in a pack. I don't know... I like the big outside piece of the Cinnabon. That's the best. I'll fight you for it. The inside is just too gooey. And they're coffee isn't the greatest but I didn't want to stand in another line for Starbucks so it'll do.
