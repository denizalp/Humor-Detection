Okay food, strange serving staff. I usually go to the location on Atwood so I figured I'd try something different with my date. Menu is similar to Atwood so no worries there. Our server, however, was exceptionally chatty and fairly inappropriate with us and other tables in our vicinity.\n\nWe specifically asked for vegan options, and was told their eggrolls were vegan EXCEPT for the wrapper, which has egg. Huh? Why not just say it isn't vegan? Were you just going to serve us the raw, uncooked innards of an eggroll? Do you know what vegan means? We got the spring rolls instead.\n\nAfter telling her about our dietary choice she told us she was a pescetarian, and that she needed her fish. Good for you champ, thankfully you're not ordering food here, we are.\n\nWe then later overheard her talking to another table about the kind of men she likes to date. In case you're curious, that's over 5'9\", strong, and capable of lifting her up. \n\nIt should be mentioned this person was likely a co owner or owner or family member of the owners. There were a couple younger servers there that were giving patrons an acceptable amount of space and they were not at all a problem.\n\nOh yeah. Food. For entrees we got the mango curry with no added proteins and the mock duck curry. My partner and I didn't like the mock duck (seitan) so we picked it out and ate the veggies. The mango curry was great - mango was more ripe and better tasting than at the Atwood location. This is perhaps the only thing the WIlly St location did better.\n\nVery strange. Very, very strange. My recommendation is to go to the Atwood location if you intend to sit in.
