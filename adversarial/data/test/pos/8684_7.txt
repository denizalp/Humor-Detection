If you forget your toiletry essentials, you can get them here.  The staff is really helpful and friendly.  The \"shop\" is well stocked with the basic essentials and other gift items.  It's a great place to grab toiletries and snacks for your first evening at The Red Rock.  If you can wait, you  can go north (off Red Rock campus) across West Charleston Boulevard and visit many of the retail outlets along the boulevard for your essentials.
