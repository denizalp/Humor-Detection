This is a brand new Target in a new suburban area of North Las Vegas. They started building this just as the  recession started.  The immediate area has miles of beautiful and unoccupied homes.  As majestic as this store is, it's less occupied than most Targets.  In my three previous trips to this store, they hadn't skimped on cashiers or service.  The store is very clean, very neat, and well stocked-though this isn't a good descriptor during the holidays. Prior to Black Friday, they just were not very busy. I was concerned that their low sales volumes might result in a closure.  But thankfully, so far, so good.\n\nDuring Black Friday 2009, it was great  that it was super busy for the first time since it opened. Parking is usually easy, but 2\/3 of the close to the entry spots were taken around noon.  The employees do a great job of keeping the carts in front, and you can usually find an employee if you have a question. On this visit, I was just looking around to see the Black Friday specials, i.e. the large screen TV's. There were the usual picked over, messy displays by customers. There were some crowds as expected but they were civil. No trampling allowed. Snack bars and bathrooms are super clean. Though I came away empty handed, it was nice they were ready for the holiday rush. \n\nBut the previous time I wast there during Labor Day, one of my relatives wanted to buy the display model of a BBQ.  The employee working that area said he didn't think they could sell it, but he called the store manager, anyway.  The manager couldn't leave his post, so the employee walked us over to him, and explained our request.  The manager said the corporate policy is no sales of display items.  But the teen employee called the next closest store and found out they had them.  I had to look around and make sure I wasn't at Nordstrom. Wow, well spoken, service minded teen employees do exist! Checkout was 4 minutes tops. Overall a decent shopping trip.
