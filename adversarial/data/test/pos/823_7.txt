LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  \n\nWe buy our pre-made holiday dinner here every year.  It's perfect.....Turkey, Spiral Honey Ham, Stuffing, Cranberries, Mashed Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes, Gravy...it's all there for under $100!  We order it in advance and pick it up the day before the holiday and then heat it up....within 2 hrs we're all set.  Less time cooking\/preparing = more time with Family. :)\n\nOther than that, it's also a decent grocery store and in our neighborhood.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
