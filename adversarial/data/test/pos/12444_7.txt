Having worked at the San Tan Village mall for almost a year, I am a frequent visitor of Blue Wasabi. I always liked their different take on common sushi rolls and the unique rolls they offered that you can't get anywhere else.\n\nBecause of this, I asked a girlfriend of mine to meet me for drinks and sushi at Blue Wasabi last week. She had never been there before and I was talking up how awesome the place was. \n\nThe minute we walked in, the manager (a gentleman I am familiar with, real Rico Suave looking kind of guy) asked us if we'd like to sit inside or outside. We said we'd take a spot outside. He turned to a hostess and said \"will you check if any tables are available outside?\" She walked to the door and looked through the glass to check. He practically shouted at her \"I meant you need to physically walk your body outside, look around and see if a table is open.\" Then he smiled at my friend and I as if this was a normal way to interact with your employees. \n\nIt got worse from there. Our server, a guy whose name I didn't even bother to remember, looked dirty and unkempt. He referred to my friend and I as \"dude\" and \"bro\" from the very beginning. He also finished each sentence with \"yo\". For example, \"Bro, you want some water, dude, yo?\" (I swear, I can't make this up.) \n\nWe decided to laugh about it. Anyway, we put in a sushi order. After an hour, we did not receive our sushi. We asked our server where the sushi was. He said \"Dude, I don't think it got made, yo.\" Well, no kidding. \"Yeah, bro. Yo, I'll put in that order now, dude.\" \n\nWe eventually got our sushi. We were having girl time. It was not really that big of a deal. Eventually, another girl joined us and we ended up ordering more drinks. By the time we had been there for two hours, our server believed we were his friends and started to curse at us in addition to using \"bro\", \"dude\" and \"yo\" as his go to's. We started hearing, \"Yo, that f***ing sushi roll is dope, bro.\" \n\nThe highlight of the night came at 11 pm when the restaurant closed. We had paid our tabs ($200 between the three of us, by the way) and were finishing our last rounds of Sake. At 11:03, they shut the lights outside off and the music. At 11:10, our server came out and handed us 3 styrofoam cups, poured our alcoholic drinks in the cups and said \"Here. Take your drinks to go, yo. No rush, bro. But you gotta go, dude.\" \n\nMost unprofessional, horrifying experience at any restaurant I've ever had. We were not valued, we were treated like an inconvenience and booted off the patio of the restaurant with alcohol in styrofoam cups. \n\nWill not be returning.
