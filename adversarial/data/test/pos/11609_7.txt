A funny thing happened on the way to the bathroom.  We were dining at Latitude 8 with some other yelpers.  I excused myself and headed to the restroom.  It is in a shared hall in the back of the building, so when I entered the hall from the restaurant I was facing a door labeled \"Urban Tea Loft.\"\n\nI poked my head in and decided we should pay a visit as we were wrapping up our meal at latitude.\n\nWhat a gem!  We met the owners Eric and Glynis and they were charming!  Service was outstanding and Eric took the time to explain all about the teas - flavors, health benefits, etc.  He also explained how to operate the tea pot which is good because we would have had a mess otherwise.\n\nWe shared a large pot of jasmine tea.  It was good but a little flowery for my taste.  The strawberry lemonade was excellent.  \n\nThe atmosphere is both warm and hip.  They have two private rooms as well as outdoor seating.  They offer wine, beer and bar drinks.  I'm not sure how extensive the drink selection is but they looked to have a fairly complete if basic bar selection.\n\nAll in all an excellent addition to any neighborhood dining area and a great place to come after meals to hang and have a drink.  I'll be back to try the food and update later.
