Well here's an update everyone got back into town with friends so decided to do a little gambling we played some roulette and a little Dynasty Baccarat and again We see a staff member chewing gum and dealing I don't know why management allow them to do this ?? We don't see this at the Venetian...It's not good for the LVSC Brand...
