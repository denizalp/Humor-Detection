This bakery is phenomenal! I've been getting macarons, cupcakes, cookie sandwiches, and even my birthday cake from here for the past year now and I've never been let down when I try something new. I highly recommend the macarons (birthday cake is my favorite!). Most recently, my family got cupcakes for Father's Day- my grandpa said that they were the best he had ever had! I'm sure I'll be back soon, especially with the convenience of their cart at Crocker Park during the summer months!
