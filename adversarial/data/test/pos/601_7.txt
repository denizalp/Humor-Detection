I rarely write scathing yelp reviews unless the situation was absolutely awful - this lack of dining experience deserved zero stars. \n\nMy boyfriend and I walked into Japango on Sunday night around 8:15pm, two tables of 2 were open. There were 2 chefs behind the counter, 1 server chatting\/laughing with the chefs speaking Japanese, 1 server putting dishes away behind the chefs - NO ONE GREETED US AT THE DOOR OR ACKNOWLEDGED OUR ARRIVAL \n\nThey all stood around as if no new customers had just stepped into the restaurant. The place is tiny, it's very easy to detect when a new person has walked inside. Two empty two-person tables were also open!!\n\nTwo uber eats drivers walked in shortly after our arrival and the server spoke to them about their pick up's and continued to ignore the two dining customers standing beside the door. \n\nAfter standing around for nearly 10 minutes we decided to leave. Typical Japanese restaurants will say goodbye to customers, needless to say Japango staff ignored us as we stepped outside.
