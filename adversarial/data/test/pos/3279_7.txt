I am not sure how to best rate Ezekiel's!  I had one cat fish, one dark meat, one collard green and one cheese & macaroni. Cat fish was on point, dark meat was very crispy but had no flavor. Collard green was meh, kind of salty, mac'n cheese was good, corn meal bread was dry. Price was very fair at $12.99.  I had been wanting to try this place for a while.  Now that l checked marked it off my list l am in no hurry to return.  Bottom line is, food is fine for the money.
