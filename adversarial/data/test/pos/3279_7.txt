Not on the top of my list of places to go. Here's why:\n\nI've been here a handful of times. Ownership has changed a couple different times. Once I came here after a browns game, and didn't feel like drinking beer, so I asked the bartender if they had any wine. Instead of a simple, \"No, I'm sorry, we don't,\" the bartender decided to get smart with me and, which quite an attitude, said that if I wanted wine, \"you can go across the street where there's a wine bar. Why would we have wine here?\" Really dude? Why would you have customers here? Or should I say how and not why.\n\nThe patio is ok, some parts of it seem like it needs some weeding. The only reason I would go here if for taco night, or if I wanted to sit outside and\/or taco night. This place is really hit or miss. Service sucks. Rude rude rude.
