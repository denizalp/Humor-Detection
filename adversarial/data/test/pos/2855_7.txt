I've been here both for the free opening and I've paid for dinner. This place is not as good as their CA locations, but is much better and WAY cleaner than any other AYCE kbbq in Vegas. \n\nThe biggest problem is the service. The wait staff seems to be all over the place. Nobody seems to have tables - every person services every table - which means nobody takes responsibility for each table. Asking about missing orders is futile.\n\nKarage is hit and miss. It's been raw, rock hard and good - very inconsistent. In general, the portions are small, which is good, so that you can try lots of items without having leftovers.\n\nThis location has the potential to be great because the food is good. They just have to give their staff some serious direction.
