I am still in amazement about the concept and location of this place.  Never hearing or knowing anything about Big Jim's certainly made my first visit here extra special.  I felt as if I was going on a mini adventure as I traveled down the slope to get there.  My first impression and thoughts upon seeing it was that this place is Pittsburgh through and through! I mean there is a gigantic bridge hovering over it!  It looks like a scene right out of The Deer Hunter.\nEntering the place was another experience.  It was a warm April evening so there were a couple of locals hanging out on the corner to complete the scene.\n\nOnce inside I couldn't believe the number of people who were dining, and the levels of activity taking place here on a Friday.  I was almost getting dizzy from all of the various motions swarming around me.\n\nThis place is not for amateurs or for anyone who is claustrophobic.  You must enjoy outdated d√©cor, wood paneling and eclectic collections. On one side of the room is a statue of the Virgin Mary and on the other wall has a hanging beer promo sign. Did I mention that Guy Fieri featured Big Jim's on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives?  His picture is on the wall as well.\n\nThe menu is something to study carefully since according to those who were dining with me everything is served in huge portions and tastes excellent.  I tend to be a little more skeptical with such advice so I usually try to order something I cannot order anywhere else. However, the more I looked the more I realized that the easiest thing to do was to order a draft beer and a steak hoagie and just simply plan multiple trips here in order to try a little bit of everything!\n\nThe food, service, and atmosphere is certainly a treasure to be repeated.
