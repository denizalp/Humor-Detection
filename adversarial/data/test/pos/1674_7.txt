Fiddlesticks is a great place to go with a date, as a group, or with the kids. The arcade area has the latest games (including several of DDR), the food is decent, and the miniature golf fun if nothing special. They have a slew of attraction choices, such as batting cages, a driving range, and a go-cart track. We especially like the bumper cars--in WATER! Don't go if you don't want to get wet. \n\nOne edge Fiddlesticks has over other Valley amusement-park-type choices is their Kiddie Land, including the Dragon Ride and Miner Mike Roller Coaster.
