WILL TRAVEL FOR THE GOOD STUFF. MAKE THE TRIP.\n\nSeeing that all of my closest Yelp buddies were going on a daily basis and there was nothing but 5 star ratings and amazing pics being posted I was down to making the Henderson trip.  I can say it's well worth the trip. Just look at all the pictures and tell me if you can say no to them.  Here are some of mine.\n\nA large bowl of black sesame shaved snow topped with pieces of pineapple and strawberry condensed milk. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/frost-bites-shavery-henderson?select=he61-y1oIFDjq-urlMA--A#QhW04HUrzEeDgczSuMLrBg Sorry I took a few bites out of the bowl before I realized that I should really take a pic.  I've never heard of anyone doing a black sesame snow flavor before.  It was so amazing.  I could've ate it on it's own, just a large bowl of black sesame but adding the toppings drool. \n\nBest part of it other then the taste was it was 110 degrees outside, or near that temp, and my bowl didn't seem soupy or runny, I even took my time enjoying it, that is crazy. The consistency of the snow was so smooth and perfect, it is definitely the best here.\n\nI was good with one large but because I really wanted to try another one went back for 2nds. A large bowl of half mucho mango shaved snow and half coconut delight shaved snow topped with pieces of strawberries and caramel sauce. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/frost-bites-shavery-henderson?select=he61-y1oIFDjq-urlMA--A#VdiGyk6TOeNEfPwNudFelQ \n\nLocated in a parking lot shared with a Smith's and Del Taco you'll find the Frost Bites trailer. They use natural ingredients. They have 4 various sizes from a kid size to the Monster size that are inexpensive. And various delicious flavors of shaved snow from Vanilla Dream to a Smooth Green Tea, toppings from mango to sprinkles, and drizzles from sweet condense milk to a chocolate sauce. Eating the shaved snow naked, without any toppings or drizzle works out too. If you order the large or monster they'll allow 2 flavors of shaved snow, don't know if they'll do 3 but I'm happy with 2. They have their own stamp cards. But they'll honor those Kuma stamp cards, you know the ones you were going to toss out. The two owners are very cool and friendly people. Look out for newer flavors.\n\nIf there was a place that deserves a 6th star this is one of them. I'm very jealous of Henderson, VERY.
