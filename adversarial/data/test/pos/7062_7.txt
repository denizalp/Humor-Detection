Oh baby... oh, baby baby...\n\nThe Original Burrito Co is 100% amazing. #12 breakfast burrito. The Veggie Mixito. The cheese quesedilla. The tostada.\n\nOh, and how can you go wrong with a salsa bar?!? YUMMMM!\n\nI have an affinity for pay-at-the-counter mexican restaurants, and this one takes the cake.
