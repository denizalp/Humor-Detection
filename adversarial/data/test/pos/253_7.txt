Fantastic experience and delicious food.\n\nCame here with Lauren and Tony for their 7 course beef menu, which was incredible. \n\nThe restaurant is unassuming, and the only other table in the place was a multi-generational Cantonese family. Already, I knew this was going to be good. \n\nFor the meal, you basically get beef served 7 ways, served with rice paper rolls, rice noodles, basil, mint, sprouts and nuoc cham. You roll it yourself, which was a little challenging at first, but we all did better once we figured out that you can't over stuff it (except for Tony, who's skills degenerated with every course somehow)\n\nIt was a ton of fun, and delicious. I'm planning on returning with my friends and my own multi-generational Cantonese family. Also, the price was under $20 with tax and tip!
