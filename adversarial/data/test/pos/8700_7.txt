My experience at the Albertsons was pretty awesome tonight.  I needed to take my father there for some pre Thanksgiving shopping and I was planning on getting some bacon.  I stopped by the magazine section which is right by the entrance and checked out some magazines for about 15 minutes.  In store security and a few employees actually said hi and were friendly.  I was expecting them to tell me to move on.  Didn't happen.  \n\nI hooked up with my dad and daughter and started to shop and the staff helped me find a few items I couldn't find.  The only thing I didn't like about tonight was that the store was kinda busy and they had maybe three lanes open at 7 at night.  That seems to be a problem with a lot of grocery stores now a days.  I guess they are trying to save money.  \n\nI go here during the day a lot to pay bills when I forget to mail them in.  Like the previous review....you don't need a card anymore.  Give it a try.  Yelp on!
