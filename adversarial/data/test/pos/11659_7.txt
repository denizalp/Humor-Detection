Eveylyn hosted the latest iteration of Cheap Pours and Sticky Floors which is a recurring CMYE theme that I have been attending for the past while.\n\nOK so this place is a bar rather a beer bar and they have what can only be conveyed as a really really really long list of beers to choose from.  So long that you and pretty much almost every human being wouldn't be able to consume the entire list in one sitting and live to tell about it.  \n\nIf you like choices, this place has them.  I'm talking special beers, not Molson Canadian, Coors Light or Budweiser here... I'm talking different kinds of craft beers, special treats for the beer lovers that want to have a taste of something not so everyday and not so common.  No ladies and gents this place has the kind of canned delights that you wish were as widely available as water from a tap after you sample what could be and what should be.  \n\nFor somebody like me that happens to like new, different and special every once in a while or at least more often than not to change things up this is the place where I can live and die.  OK maybe that is a little too dramatic... let's just say I would love to visit this place more than once and more often if possible.  \n\nTo start things off we had some pitchers of Steam Whistle.  Now Steam Whistle is just a common everybody Toronto beer which isn't bad and in my opinion a lot better than much else out there as far as common beers go.  \n\nAs far as the menu went I decided to go for the Nicklebrook Immodest which was a double IPA.  It was a little pricey (almost 11 dollars) but let me just say that this beer was like what espresso is to watered down weak coffee.  This had a bouquet of hops when you brought it near your nose and the taste... well it tasted how it smelled and it was stronger (9%).  This was a special brew indeed.  It took me a while to finish it as I was savoring it for quite some time as it's not a chugging type of drink.  No, you want to enjoy this one and make it last if you can.\n \nWhile it may seem I've gone off the deep end and in total infatuation with the the products served at Tallboys (namely the drinks) I won't neglect speaking of the food.  The menu for food is a pretty simple one, between a variety of sandwiches it seems that half the menu is dedicated to burgers or what you can have on them.  There is a special where you can have a single burger and a Steam Whistle for 12 dollars I believe OR you can order from the menu from the variety of specialty burgers as I did.  \n\nI went with the Smokey Blue Burger which included blue cheese, bacon on a double burger.  The choice of sides are fries, nachos, a salad or poutine for an extra 3 dollars.  I just went with the fries but the fries I have to say were really good.  They were the furthest thing from just plain dial in type fries.  The burger was amazing.  They were top grill mashed patties and they tasted great with the toppings I had it was probably the best burger I've had in a place that is known to specialize in something else.\n\nOK so I mentioned the sexy beer and great food but I won't forget to mention our server who was our host and the owner.  Phil was welcoming right upon my walking in the door.  Phil as the night went on I learned wasn't just our server or our personal host but he was the owner Tallboys and treated us like he wanted us there.  To me that's what is important.  You can have good food and good drinks but if you are the type of personable fun to be around and great to speak with kind of personality than absolutely your business deserves to have that 5th star in my books.  \n\nThis experience was an all around great night and really if I have to think there's nothing I could possibly say could have been better.  Phil is a guy that I want to hear speak and I want to ask him questions.  He is very involved in his business and his community and is very happy with the neighborhood and his neighbors.  \n\nTallboys is the kind of place I would love to make my regular place.  It's just kind of unfortunate that I'm going to have to instead make it my special place because I don't live close enough to make it a regular stop.  \n\nGreat things are being done here and the only problem I have is not being able to come here as often as I would like to.  Besides that this place is fun, good food, good times, good drinks and amazing service.  Kudos.
