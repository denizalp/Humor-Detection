I think I have bad luck when it comes to Italian dining.  Prosecco fits the bill.  \n\nLooking forward to a nice dinner with friends, we were all anxious to experience a new place.  An experience it was.  The service wasn't quite what I expected.  We didn't have a definitive waiter.  Many gentlemen stopped at our table during the evening.  It was unsettling when we had to repeat our order at the end of the evening because he didn't know who ordered which entree.  It was also unsettling when I ask one waiter if they offer Moscato and he says yes.  A different gentlemen comes back with Riesling telling me it's the same and they don't have Moscato.  I reluctantly took the Riesling but the magic act was unnecessary.  \n\nFor my meal I started with the Caesar Salad.  It was a very large portion I which I could share with my husband.  Great flavor with freshly shaved Parmesan was delicious.  \n\nI also opted for the Stuffed Salmon.  Well, you could probably just name it salmon because there was very very little crab stuffing.  The fish was also over cooked. It was not a dish I would recommend.  \n\nWith a competitive restaurant town, I would've hoped for a better presentation.  A three hour overpriced meal left me underwhelmed.
