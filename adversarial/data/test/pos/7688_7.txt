Call me childish, but I just can't get enough of Discovery Place! Usually I'm here with work, but don't let me fool you -- I love to play at this children's museum! They have so many fun, interactive exhibits from a bed of nails to virtual reality goggles and the aquariums and rainforest... I could spend an entire day playing here, with or without kids. \n\nIf you're lucky enough to have children as an excuse to visit, plan a day out here and be ready to have just as much if not maybe a little more fun than your kiddos. If you don't have children, check out their Discovery After Dark events. These fundraisers are 21+ (hooray, beer!) and are a great chance to explore the museum sans kids. \n\nHmmm... What else do you need to know to have a successful visit? Parking is validated in their deck off 6th. The cafe is actually pretty decent if you need a bite to eat. The IMAX theatre is a little outdated -- still worth seeing the movie if it's an interesting one though. Staff are super knowledgeable and friendly! Gift shop has lots of fun, science-y trinkets to take home. \n\nNow, go forth and have fun!
