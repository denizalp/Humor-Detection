I probably should've read the reviews prior to coming to this sorry ass subway. I really don't even eat subway all like that but I was on a time crunch and this was the only thing that seemed appealing at the time and with the limited amount of places to eat in the area! I thought the whole $5 footlong thing was still happening but apparently that's been done for a while! Just goes to show how much o eat at subway right? Anyways I walk in no employees visible except for in the back there was a teenage girl sitting on the counter and another boy in the back with her? Hmm.. Anyways so they waited about 1 minute to come out and greet me the proceeded to ask for my order! I inquired about the $5 footlong and she pointed up and the menu and said no but we do have the lunch deal for $5 which included a 6 inch sub, a drink and a cookie! Whoohoo **rolls eyes** I opted for the tuna sandwich and boy oh boy they are super stingy on the amount they decide to put on your sandwich because those measly little scoops of tuna and all that bread was a disaster! I just thought to myself whatever it's $5 I'm hungry no time to complain I gotta get going! When I went to get the ice tea there was none and I proceeded to ask \" you guys don't have anymore ice tea\" she responded nope but if you want some then I can make you some? Are you kidding so that lets me know that the entire time it was sitting there empty they knew about it and decided to not make any more until a customer asked? No thanks! I can't see them staying in business too much long with these kids they have working who act like they hate their jobs! I won't return...
