Great breakfast if you're looking for a bunch of food!  We got pineapple upside-down pancakes and a linguica\/scrambled eggs\/hash browns\/biscuits and gravy combo - bam - everything was awesome. Linguica (spicy Portuguese sausage) is a personal fave, and most places don't have it - props for that! HUGE, fluffy biscuit, OK gravy, that oddly, the biscuit made up for (never thought I'd say that)\n\nThe hash browns were savory and a great crunch:soft ratio, and the eggs great as well - perfectly cooked. The pancakes, thick, filled with warm pineapple chunks, topped with syrup and whipped cream, a perfect counter to all the savory stuff.  Washed down with a huge mug of diner coffee, and a waiter who made a joke about smoking pot once every 5 minutes, a great breakfast.  Thanks, BB!
