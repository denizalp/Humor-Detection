If you are expecting a small traditional Japanese sushi house ... this is not that.  Which is fine.  It's a large bar-oriented place that is Asian themed.  I started with Hamachi sashimi and Tuna Tataki.  It started fine ... usually a good sign when the ginger is not dyed pink.  The Hamachi delivered! Nicely cut and presented, very tasty and nice texture.  However, the tuna tataki was the worst I've ever had. While I realize that there is room for creative interpretation .... my general expectation is some type of raw diced or thinly sliced tuna ... sometimes with a creative garnish like radish or jalepeno, and then served in some type of ponzu sauce.  This was not that.  It was cold seared ahi tuna (cooked) served in a very bland sauce ... and it cost $16 and was featured as one of their \"specialties\".\n\nThe rolls that followed were ok.  Rice did not stand out in any way ... cool and moist, no great texture or ambiance.  \n\nService was good.\n\nBottom line is a 2.5.
