I went here for lunch and wow was I impressed.  Seafood this good and we are not even near the ocean - awesome.  I had treated a fellow Elite to lunch at Yonaka's and he returned the favor by taking my out to lunch at  King's.  We truly had one of the best lunches I have had in years.  We ordered so much Seafood I was worried they might run out.  It is fun to eat out with someone who truly enjoys food!  We started out with a dozen of their oyters which were all delicious.  We had Thorndyke Bay - Hood Cancel, Washington, Hama Hama - Hood Canal, Washington, Kumamoto - Laguna Bay, Mexico,  James River - Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, Naked Cowboy - Long Island Sound, New York and Island Creek - Duxbury, Massachusetts.  They went down so good that we ordered another dozen.  We also had a 1\/2 pound of Wild Texas Brown Shrimp which were chilled and very tasty.  To add to the appetizer round we also had a 1\/2 pound of Farmed Price Edward Island Blue Mussels.  Although not a huge fan of mussels I actually enjoyed these.  \n   For the main course i had the Indian Ocean Ahi which was cooked perfectly - Chef Style.  It same crusted with Sesame seeds and was accompanied with mac and cheese and spinach.  I had a very tasty dipping sauce which added to the flavor but did not overpower the great taste of the Ahi.  The mac and cheese and spinach were both really good and were a prefect partner for the delicious Ahi.    \n   King's has a very inviting decor which reminds me of an East Coast Seafood restaurant.  Since it was cooler and cloudy outside we sat outside in their covered patio section which was really nice.  Once the heat goes away would love to sit there again and enjoy a great meal and take it the atmosphere.  The service was outstanding as our Waitress was fun and ensured we were well taken care of.  It was a great lunch at a fantastic place.  I was truly Living the Dream at King's Fish House!!!  I need to take my wife and daughter here soon as they will love King's as much as I do.
