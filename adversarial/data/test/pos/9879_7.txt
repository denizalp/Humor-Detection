Where have I been ? Before pho t this was the closest to me yet I would still drive to Chinatown when I wanted some pho. I have no idea why because this place is pretty damn good. I came by myself on a Friday after trying to decide what I wanted to eat in the UNLV area and ultimately ended trying to figure out where to go and just said eff it. I love pho why not ?! \n\nThey greet you upon entering and tell You to seat yourself then bring water and menus immediately. Thanks for the fast service ! \n\nI went for rare steak pho and a Bahn mi with charbroiled pork. \n \n\nThe pho was piping hot and flavorful. Initially after tasting I told myself the broth was missing something. Maybe it could be a little more flavorful. Then it hit me duh it's missing lime ! After that it was A Ok ! Not my favorite broth I've tried but the fact that they gave a huge amount of noodles and meat made up for it. They definitely are not stingy with Portion at $8.50 a bowl. The Bahn mi came out with the pho. Crusty baguette bread loaded with meat and vegetable. I did enjoy the Bahn mi but I'd have to say I would have enjoyed more vegetables on it. \n\nAfter eating that delicious pho I only took a few bites of the Bahn mi and took it to go and enjoyed it later. Still good it's just better to eat it fresh when the bread it's till warm and toasty. \n\nDefinitely worth trying. Next time I'll try a bubble drink ;) and have my pho fix !
