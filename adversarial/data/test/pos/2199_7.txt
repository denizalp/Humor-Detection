As you will notice you will see a lot of reviews from Yogurtland this is quickly becoming one of my favorite pastimes. When you enter this location there's plenty of parking out front however the parking stalls are smaller than normal. When you enter the facilities was very clean well-maintained and you were greeted with a friendly smile. There are sample cups available for you to try the different flavors I had a time or if you're like me you're already have your favorites and you know exactly where to go. The prices are very comparable to other locations and other yogurt shops.  Upon pain and issue in my frequent Yogurtland card which is always a good thing because you get free 4 ounce yogurt. I was which the way to a nice table and enjoy my yummy yogurt. If you are in the area and looking for a sweet treat this would be the place to come to you I highly recommend it.
