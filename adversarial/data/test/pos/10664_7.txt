Let me start with, I am a cosmetologist and I typically do my own waxing. But, I decided I really didn't feel like making a mess at home, so I hit up TPK in Summerlin as a walk-in and Brenda was able to take me back within a few mins. I was in and out within 10 mins, actually more like 8 mins, anyways, while certain spots are more painful than others, she did a great job and she was very friendly and made me feel super relaxed. For the record, I prefer soft wax over hard wax and was happy that TPK uses soft wax. It's quick, clean and faster than hard wax. Get me in and out as quick as possible when it comes to waxing. I am happy with TPK, I'll be back.
