It had been awhile since we have been here. I guess Samstown bought them out last year. We were surprised at how many people were there. It was like a ghost town.\nI thought I'd try some machines and they were not hitting at all.\nThe buffet closed which didn't surprise us, it was pretty bad Everytime we ever ate there.\nWe went for some offers and I guess unless I get more in the mail we probably won't go back.
