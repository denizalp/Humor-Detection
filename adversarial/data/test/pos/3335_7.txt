Wow, Vegas, what an original concept. A nightclub. In a casino. That looks like every other nightclub in Vegas. How did you do it? \n\nMy best friend and I were approached at the Bellagio by someone asking if wanted to get in. They offered no cover and free drinks. We love free, but especially free vodka. \n\nYou go in and go through this ridiculous process of getting a card, handing that card over and getting a piece of paper, handing that piece of paper to someone who directs you upstairs. You get two free drink tickets and then head to the bar. Thank goodness the paper swapping is over, that was monotonous. \n\nWe walk in and automatically realize we're in a nightclub with a bunch of guys from Saturday Night Live bobbing their heads sideways to the music. Sorry, it was all I could think of. \n\nWe head downstairs and we happen to be on the edge of 'VIP.' Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry that I have better things to do with hundreds (or thousands) of dollars than hand it over to your douche-y nightclub for the privilege of dancing on your sacred dance floor for a night. So, with that attitude, we actually get pushed (literally) back while some pseudo-body guard holds his arms out like he's protecting the POTUS and lets people who actually fell for the scam sit down. It was so offensive that I almost dumped my vodka on him, but I could never waste perfectly good liquor on something like that. I push back and feel a little give, but he obviously considers me less than because I didn't pay $250 for a $20 bottle of Skye vodka (I have better taste than that anyway) so we walk away and consider ourselves fortunate that we didn't get caught up in the illusion. \n\nThe music is okay, the club is okay. They have half naked chicks 'dancing,' they give away free drinks, you get treated like a pariah. What more could you ask for.\n\nIf you go to this club you are such a sucker. Hated it.
