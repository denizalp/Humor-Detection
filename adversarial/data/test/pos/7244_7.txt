Not impressed. My party stopped by to try their Taco Tuesday special which ran at $24 for an all you can eat tacos and margarita. Sounds appealing, right? \n\nWell, we got there and the hostess told us that since we didn't have a reservation, the wait would be about an hour long. Mind you, there were empty seats throughout that hour-long wait which ticked me off in the first place. So we waited nearby and we were ravenous. So we hoped that this food would satisfy the hunger despite the wait. \n\nWhen we were called, the nachos were served immediately and waters were serve all around the table. Then a few minutes later cues our waitress who explained that Taco Tuesday was only $29. Uhm, did we miss something? We agreed on a family style dinner and she left shortly after. Addressing our confusion about the sudden $5 jump, a few in my party decided to save the confrontation while someone else decided to question it. When the waitress came back, she said that this was the last night they were running the \"smooth\" tequila and thought it would be a better experience for us. Sure, if we were there solely for the tequila. But we're responsible adults with day jobs and the last thing we want is to get hammered on a Tuesday night. My friend who asked was kind enough to dismiss the issue and resumed the night. Still, I would've much appreciated to have had the option of not paying an extra $5 per person for drinks. We're not much of a drinker to fully maximize the promotion. \n\nNow, let's address the subpar food. God! For more than an hour long wait, you'd hope the food would deliver quality, but it didn't. They doubled the tortilla to prevent it from getting too soggy and to my theory, to make you full faster. Honestly, I've had better tacos than this. It felt as though their tacos were made as an afterthought. Nothing too special about their quality with no notable flavors to heighten the experience. I probably could've made the same disappointing tacos myself.\n\nMy regret for the night, waiting for mediocre food and automatically upgraded for it. As if I needed more reason to pay for a less-satisfying meal. \n\nWould I go back? No. I'd rather take my business somewhere else like Me Gusta Tacos which is just down the street in the promenade-- their tacos are so much better.
