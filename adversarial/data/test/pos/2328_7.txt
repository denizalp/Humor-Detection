I went to CASA with a friend on Friday to get a couple drinks. We had tried to go here a few weeks back, but the place was way too packed. On this night, we were able to sit up at the bar under a heater, which was perfect. This place has a surprisingly nice cocktail menu, with many imaginative options. I had their take on a Moscow mule, the light and stormy. It was fairly tasty, but not fantastic. My friend had their take on a white Russian... and this thing was fabulous! It was a white Russian with rumchata in it and cinnamon on the top.... so good! They also have a wide variety of beers on tap. My friend was talking about one of the beers and before I could tell her to ask for a taster, she had one... now that's good service. I'd like to come back to try some of their interesting food options (mac and cheese burrito... oh ya!).
