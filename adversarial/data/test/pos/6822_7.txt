I actually had planned on never visiting this place based on Yelp reviews but my cousin was in town and she wanted me to meet her and her son there.  Upon entering this place smells amazing and everything is beautifully decorated.  The night I was there one of the employees was just chatting away with a group of her friends who had come to visit basically blocking one of the display cases.  I was young once so I get it, but take it outside cause I can guaranty your employer would not appreciate that, and as a customer I don't either because the store is not that big in the first place.    \n\nAs far as the desserts go I chose the lemon bar because there were only a couple left in the display case so I thought maybe that was a popular item and hoped for the best.  No flavor, no real taste.  The frozen lemon bars you can get from Trader Joe's taste 100 percent better.
