I don't ever write reviews, but after my experience with Animart, I had to let everyone know. I recently went there to learn about fish and set up my own tank. The day I went in, I was talking with an employee. I told her that I had never had a fish tank before, that I knew nothing about it and had no supplies for it. I told her the kind of fish that I wanted and asked what all I needed to know. She got me my fish, showed me a ten gallon tank, and grabbed me a filter and some food. She told me that I did not need anything else to set up my tank and that I was good to go. \nI got home to find out that it was DEFINITELY not everything I needed to set up my tank, not to mention the fact that you are supposed to have your tank set up AT LEAST three days before you put your fish in the tank, so she shouldn't have even sold me the fish and the tank in the same day. \nAlso, the fish she sold me were tropical fish. They have to have a heater in the water to make it warmer, which she never mentioned to me. My dad went back to Animart with me. We talked with a manager that worked in the fish department. It turned out I needed another fifty dollars of supplies to ready my fish tank, and it turns out that they had a starter pack for fifty dollars that had everything I needed in it that she never even bothered to show me. \nLuckily, the manager let me exchange my stuff for the starter pack and refunded my fish. I set up my new tank. After about a week, I went back to Animart and got my fish. All but one died the next day. Animart says that they have a two day guarantee on fish. Rather than refunding my fish, they gave me a fish credit that can only be used on fish. So now, I have this little piece of paper that I can't lose track of or I'm out my money. Then, my last fish died just outside of the 48 hour guarantee, so there's \"nothing\" they could do about it. I asked an employee if I should clean my tank before putting new fish in. They told me to do a fifty percent water change. \nBefore doing this, because of my displeasure with Animart, I decided to call Petsmart. I talked to a very helpful employee at Petsmart that told me NOT to do the water change because all water has to go through its nitrogen cycle. He told me to bring in my water to get PH tested before touching my tank. It turns out that my tank water was find and that I was able to put new fish in it. I talked to him about the kind of fish that I had before. I found out that they are actually part salt water fish and part freshwater fish. They live right where the water meets. He told me that it was likely that my fish died because the employee at Animart sold me no salt for them. I was able to get some new fish that day luckily. It's about three weeks later and my fish from Petsmart are doing great. I go in every once in a while my water tested to make sure the cycle is going properly. The associate I worked with the first day remembers me every time I go in and he is always super helpful and answers any questions I have. \nI pretty much heard very different information from the Petsmart employee than I heard from the Animart employees (plural, I had troubles with MULTIPLE people). I have had nothing but problems working with Animart and they couldn't even refund my fish so I still have this stupid fish credit that I don't even want to use because of my bad experience. \nBasically, I would highly recommend NOT going to Animart for any of your pet needs. And I'm not just saying that. I have shopped at Animart for years. I got all of my previous pets from there, but it seems they must have changed over the years because I got absolutely no help and a bunch of misinformation. GO TO PETSMART, PEOPLE.
