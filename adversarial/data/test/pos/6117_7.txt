As good as everyone has said.   And I got lucky enough to have had a buddy who showed up to get in line 30 minutes before our agreed upon meet up time, while I ran 45 minutes late.  So I showed up at 10:50, he was #8 in line, and we got our delicious BBQ 10 minutes later (THANKS ERIC!).  Tried a single pork rib, the smoked sausage and the fatty brisket.   Um.   Yeah, that fatty brisket is the best I have ever had, ever.  Yum Yum get me sum!   Also grabbed a takeout box of pork ribs, sausage and brisket to take home to my wife.  \n\nFurther, for those wanting PICKUP ONLY, there is a separate area that serves pre-ordered food for pickup.   You must order a minimum of 5 lbs of meat, 7 days in advance, and pickup is from 10:00am-10:30am only Tues-Sat.
