This place used to be my favorite yogurt shop in town before I discovered Yogurtland, Uswirl and Pinkberry. \n\nI'm a fan of not serving myself, although that might be a deterrent for some. I've seen too many finger lickers in line at the other yogurt chains for my comfort level. Their flavors are awesome and as I've stated before, tart is a way of life, and they offer an abundance of tart flavors and toppings.\n\nCe Fiore also has a lot of other edibles on their menu to choose from. They have boba, smoothies, iced coffees, crepes and waffles. All really good and the location is very conveniently nestled on Rainbow near my favorite Albertson's.\n\nI'm a fan, you should be too.
