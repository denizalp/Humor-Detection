Note: This used to be called Happy Family Chinese Restaurant (look up my review). Located right across the street from Altar Bar for many years, it has changed hands and is now called Little Shanghai. \n\nAnother concert night was upon me. UFO, the main act and one of my favorite bands ever, wasn't due on at Altar Bar until 10:15 PM, leaving me with a good 2 hours to find grub. I had been wanting to darken this joint's doorstep for a while since I've been past it so many times. Now I had a chance and an excuse.\n\nMiniscule and modest, only a few tables and chairs are available, and the decor is sparse. I gather that most of their business comes from takeout since no one else sat down to eat but me.\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea what I wanted, so I randomly went with the Mongolian Chicken and was left with 'nary a regret. The chicken was as tender as it was tasty, getting along famously with the chopped white onions and scallions, all of it coated in a zesty sauce. The adeptly steamed white rice came in a separate bowl. \n\nWith my hunger pangs quelled by that single dish, I settled up and mentioned to the server who I was going to watch perform.\n\n\"UFO? Who are they?\" He asked me.\n\nYou probably asked yourself the same thing at the start of my review, didn't ya?
