Okay I came back again...... and I just want to say that places like this are hard to find in this world..... not only did I come back for my appointment but I made one for my cousin at the same start time as mine and he got himself a super duper awesome package also and he LOVED IT BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII when we walked out of there he was like looking in the mirror seeing how fresh and funky they left him, K dawg did my hair all nice and stuff also like always of course, but my cousin had this tattoo lady who had some bomb art work on her and like I said she done did him up real good you hear. YOU HAVE TO COME HERE I MEAN NECK RUBS, coca cola, hot oils, THEY CAN EVEN SHAVE YOUR FACE WITH A STRAIGHT RAZOR I mean personally that seem scary to me and i dont know if I would do that but THEY GOT IT BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
