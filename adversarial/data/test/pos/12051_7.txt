Teharu Sushi?  Iloveyou Sushi.\n\nI absolutely love conveyor belt sushi, and this is one of the best I've seen.  There's a variety of rolls, the staff members are friendly, and prices are excellent.  Some conveyor belt sushi places have got it into their heads that they can increase the price for the experience, but this place stays true to serving the reason why conveyor belt sushi joints exist - allowing Americans to stuff themselves until they have to be literally rolled out the door.  And Teharu Sushi did exactly that.  When our waitress came over to count up our plate totals, she made a little \"oh!\" noise and her eyes got really big before she politely smiled and brought us our (tiny) check.  We ate that much, and it was that good.
