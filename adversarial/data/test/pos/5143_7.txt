Really enjoyed the items I purchased here. I recently ordered fir delivery which was prompt & quite easy to register here also. If you can, speak with Karen- she's very informative. Personal choice was the O.pen Vape 2.0 (Karen is a product expert with this brand!) I absolutely love it. Along with it I chose a cartridge also sold by O.pen from their Reserve series. It's a little more money but the oil is ultra - refined as opposed to only triple - refined. Ultimately I went with Girl Scout Cookies (THC: 81.50%) but was torn between that & the Blue Dream \n(THC: 87.74%) I'll be trying the Blue Dream next for sure.  Also if you're 1st time patient they will waive the $100 minimum & since mine was $100 anyway, Karen was sweet enough to send me a free pre-roll of Blue Dream along with some WM's goodies.\nThank you Releaf! You'll hear from me soon!
