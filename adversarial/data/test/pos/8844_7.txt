Review is for Restaurant Week 2017 menu.\n\nI have heard from many friends how much they like this restaurant and how nice it is to get a patio table lakeside and enjoy the food and scenery.  Coming for lunch when it was 100+ degrees, I decided to stay inside despite misters and fans on the patio.  The three items I ordered along with their menu descriptions.\n\nSmoked salmon tartine - Avocado, Red Onion, Capers, Creme Fraiche, Country Bread\nChicken picatta - Lemon Capers, White Wine, King Trumpet Mushrooms, Fingerling Potatoes\nCrème brûlée\n\nI didn't realize the restaurant was so small but at 1 PM, there were several tab;es available and a few people went outside.  Walking along rows of boxes of wine for sale, I was seated at the end of the booth closest to the store part of the building with a view of the patio and the lake beyond.\n\nThe tartine was good and had plenty of smoked salmon.  The menu in the restaurant had picatta in quotes.  I think that's because they didn't serve a traditional piccata with the breast pounded thin but rather it was a regular half chicken breast that was sliced and placed on the accompanying items.  The sauce had a mild lemon flavor and it was rich and flavorful.  The pieces of potato and the mushrooms added to the dish.\n\nThe crème brûlée--something I generally skip because if you've had one you've had them all--doesn't apply in this case.  It was some of the best vanilla bean custard I've tasted and the top was thicker and crunchier than I've had before.  It is really good!\n\nService was good.  I was brought a fresh glass of iced tea without needing to ask and the meal was coursed with just the right amount of time between each course.\n\nThis is a return place for dinner on the patio when it cools down.
