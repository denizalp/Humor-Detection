You should expect half naked to 90% naked men when you're going to a \"show\" that's called \"Thunder From Down Under.\"\n\nA majority of these guys look around the ages of early 30s and mid 30s who are in quite great shape. FOR ME, I felt like these men were not as good looking as I thought. Its their accent and their bodies that made it great. Oh, by the way, this is more of a show than a male strip club although they could easily be strippers (which I thought they were initially). \n\nOverall experience was fun. Lots of women in their late 30s and 40s here. Loads of bridesmaid parties and plenty of screaming women who seemed like they were in heat.\n\nAlso... just to get some women alll RILED up. I was one of the few women chosen to be up there with the \"sexy\" Australian. Unlike every other women that came up and freaked out. I simply played along. haha \n\nOh, to save yourself some money and fill your day with joy I HIGHLY recommend to get the package deal that comes with a pole dancing class. I believe it was called \"A girl's night out\" or something of that sort.
