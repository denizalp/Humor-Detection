Follow the yellow brick road, wait, wrong adventure. In Ikea just follow the arrows or signs as they guide you through this massive store.\n\nThis was my first trip to an Ikea and it was pretty neat. I like how they guide you through each \"department\", adding items to your cart or bag or you can grab a cart at the end to pick your larger items in the warehouse. They have room setups in each area that serve as showrooms to show you what your house could look like. \n\nI definitely will be back for my home needs. I like the layout and the fact you can helpyoruself along the way and pick your order out of the warehouse at the end. The have an area to leave the kids while you shop, a cafeteria for your pre or post shopping experience and another food area with anything from Swedish candy, salmon and condiments. This place is fun for sure.
