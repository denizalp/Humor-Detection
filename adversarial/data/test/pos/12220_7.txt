Came here at the recommendation of my niece Michelle :)\n\nChocolate is my weakness. I give it up every year for Lent & every year I fail. This year will be no exception.\n\nEnter Max Brenner. The chocolate possibilities are only limited to your imagination in this modern day version of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Since we already had dinner, dessert was in order. What we had:\n\nEighties Milkshake: milk chocolate ganache, vanilla ice cream and crunchy chocolate shell. Delicious!\nhttps:\/\/s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com\/photo\/9EOtBR8UGypynBGfV4t5Yw\/l.jpg\n\n\nItalian Hot Chocolate: thick hot chocolate with vanilla cream. Best hot chocolate I've had hands down.\nhttps:\/\/s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\/photo\/ZpDYtsaXYrLg3xE1slVigQ\/l.jpg\n\nBoth were divine. The Italian hot chocolate is served in a \"hug mug\" and the milkshake in an \"Alice\". Loved the aesthetics of these mugs and ended up buying an Alice to take home with me. Service was gracious even though we came in an hour before closing time after our drive in from San Diego. I absolutely love the decor and the staircase that looked like it could've been carved out of a block of chocolate.\n\nI'll definitely return for my chocolate fix the next time I'm in Vegas!
