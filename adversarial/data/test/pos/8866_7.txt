Came here with co-workers for lunch and I had the beef tips with a side of rice and onion rings.  Food was uninspiring, service was average, and the place was eclectic.  That said, the prices were pretty good considering the portion.  It definitely has that \"home\" feel, but not my home, maybe your home.\n\nThe place doesn't really stand out and I would find it hard to come back to this place because nothing is really spectacular or idiosyncratic about it.  The best part is that its like a 5 block walk from where I work so I get to get in a nice brisk walk over here because the food comes out a little on the slow side.\n\ndmo out.
