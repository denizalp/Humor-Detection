Bought two new tires for my RV. Paid for mounting and balancing only to find out they DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO BALANCE RV TIRES. Did not tell us and charged us anyway. As soon as we got up to 50 miles per hour then we knew. FRAUDULENT! \nManagement offers to make things right in words only. Refused to compensate us in any way.
