Yikes a business trip with a 3 day class and two exams.  NO FUN!  We should be out checking out the city but NO we were stuck inside.  So for my first lunch on my business trip and I wanted something different.  My co-workers was game for anything so I picked this place after I put the bug in there ear that we should eat somewhere NOT in SoCal.\n\nWe were lucky and there was a HUGE shopping center across from the resort so we drove over because across the street in AZ is not all that close and it was 90 plus degrees out with 100% humidity.  Not good walking conditions.  \n\nWhen we walked in the place had a nice size lunch crowd. There were only a couple people in front of us so that gave of a little time to peruse the menu.  We came at the right time because about 5 mins later the line grew long.  Apparently this is a hot place to go for lunch.\n\nWe all decided to do a soup and sand or soup and salad.  Each mean came with a chocolate covered strawberry which I gave away because I don't do chocolate.  I wish they had other options instead of the chocolate covered strawberry.  Not everyone like or eats chocolate.  A couple of my co-eaters got the dessert of chocolate cake or cheese cake which they loved.\n\nSo when you so the 2-fer meal deal you save money and you get a drink.  I got the half salad half sand.  It was quite filling and they don't skimp on the food. You cane choose any salad you want and they prepare it right in front of you.  This is the point where you can add extra this or that or have they take off something.  \n\nWe all paid and found a seat.  There is plenty both inside and out.  We choose inside to avoid the heat.  The service was really quite god as well as the food.  FRESH and FLAVORFUL for a fast foodie type place.  It sort of reminded me of a Corner bakery or Panera but you can see them preparing your food and get it before you go take a seat.  They have lots of options for all eating types which is a plus when you're a group of people that have different eat habits.  It was a good place to come for lunch but the food is pretty standard.\n\nI would definitely come here again when in town.
