I guess I prefer false food. After three visits, the juices are the only items that impress me. The edamame dumplings are bland; so is the soup - I cannot even remember which soup I had, which is not a good commentary on its memorability. The ravioli - OK, The fish - OK. I haven't had anything at TF that deviated from \"OK\", but for the mid-level prices I expect something a little higher on the tasty meter. \n\nService has been fine all three times I've visited, but nothing above what I expect for pleasant and expedient service. I always find myself distracted by the women servers' uniforms...I know it's supposed to be some organic cotton or something, but could they have come up with anything less flattering? I really feel for those poor ladies. \n\nI've also noticed that every time I've visited the crowd is about 75% women, with probably 50% of the parties women-only. Not sure what to make of that, but maybe you can have fun playing sociologist and come up with an explanation.
