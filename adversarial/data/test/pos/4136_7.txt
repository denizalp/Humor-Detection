If I was just reviewing the dark hot chocolate I would have given this place five stars.  It was amazing.  Creamy, rich and beyond good.  It was probably the best hot chocolate I have ever had.  It had thick whipped cream and a delicious chocolatey froth on top.  I wish I had some right now. \nHowever, everything else kinda canceled it out.  I had the southwestern spicy chicken salad with the light and spicy vinaigrette.  From the menu description it sounded rich and well spicy.  The chicken was well cooked but the whole dish was boring and basically had no taste.  The spicy vinaigrette tasted like olive oil.  There were no roasted poblano peppers on it and the corn tasted like it had just been thawed from a bag.  There was nothing that wrong with it but I could have easily made it at home and probably have it have more taste.  Just boring.  \nFor dessert my friend and I shared a \"classic sugar crepe\" with nutella.  I realize we may have gone the cheap route with ordering something so simple and may be not as expensive as the other options but the crepe was stone cold and very rubbery and hard to eat.  The nutella was great though and delicious with the half of strawberry that was used as a garnish.\nAlso, I really needed a knife but our server wasn't around enough to ask for for one.\nThe topping to the whole event though was being seated next to the mini store offering edible bras and underwear and different types of body frosting (I will admit I asked for the seat because it was not as cramped and a little more private but still if you have kids that might be a little uneasy for them and I had no idea that's what was being sold)
