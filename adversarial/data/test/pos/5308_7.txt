Worst theme park ever. Where do I even start? Slides that you have to climb up?! What the fu**? Not to mention the only concessions they had was smart water and weird hipster protein bars. No corn dogs. No cotton candy. And everyone was sticking their hands is bags of cocaine. Music reminded me why I'm single. BevMo punks, honestly you should check this place out.
