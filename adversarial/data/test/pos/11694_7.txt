It's a ritual to eat here if you visit the West Coast, but I'm not quite sure about this one.\n\nI had the double-double with fries. The burger was good, but not great. I got everything I'd want out of a burger, but it didn't really hit the spot like a shack stack would to be honest. Much better than McDonalds or Burger King that's for sure. The fries is what really got me. It was the absolute worst fries I've ever had. No exaggeration, it tasted like cardboard. Now I see why people order it \"animal style\" to mask how absolutely tasteless their fries are. My friend assured me that it's much better in California (probably true). I made the big mistake of having my first In n Out experience in Vegas apparently.\n\nIn conclusion, In n Out isn't that great in Vegas. You should try Carl's Jr. instead which was my favorite. Fat Burger is decent too.
