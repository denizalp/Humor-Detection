I wish I could give this place a -0. Their is no hospitality or welcoming feeling as you step in through the doors it's as if you somehow ended up at a hospital for a split second! It's the first review I have to say that I was not impressed at all from being greeted from the 2 hostess standing around pretending to be busy and not even once cracking a real smile! \nWell, onto our seats we were seated towards the back of the restaurant closest to the sushi bar. Nice ambiance with the decor I was happy to be here because I saw some of there photos with what I thought \"Yes, real Japanese food!\" I'm super hungry for some steak, baked mussels, and calamari! Boy, were we in for a rude awakening... Our waitress did not come to give us water, say hello for a good 10minutes. Within 10 minutes I knew exactly what we wanted before she came. When she did finally arrive to our table there was no introducing of her name \"hi my name is ____ I'll be your waitress tonight would you like some water?!\" Lol... Nope non of that tonight... It was \"you ready foa yoa order what you like?\" Lol and I of course had to stop her, look at her name tag and say \"well, hello Cate how are you tonight? We're very excited you stopped by FINALLY & she totally dismissed my introduction of \"hey breathe n greet us better!\" \nWe normally would put our appetizers in first, then our salads, and last our main entree. But, because I knew the service was already slow I told my husband put in all the order that way it won't take as long! Sure enough even with placing everything in we still waited almost an hour to receive our food! \nTheir calamari is a sad looking joke! I know $4.00 what was we thinking totally not worth getting, then the baked mussels it looked like it was overcooked, shriveled, and no mayo sauce on it! On top of that our water service was pretty bad we had to literally wave her down to have her full our glasses of water every time and one time we asked for both glasses to be filled she only took one! SMH... Lol! The water also was not great I could taste the chlorine in it... Blllaahhh! I just asked for a glass of wine just to be safer!\nThe only thing we liked was the teriyaki box with steak.... \nThis was a one time only visit and never again!!!
