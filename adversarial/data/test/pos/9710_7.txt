I had no real expectations prior to seeing this show as I had no idea what it was about... However, I did expect the quality to be a little higher. I'd say the show is good and overall I enjoyed it - but wouldn't really go out of my way to see it again.  \n\nThe show is campy, silly and fun, and performers really seem to give it there all, but there still seems to be a little something missing. Drinks are pricey $18 for small or $25 for large, but having a few alcoholic beverages will definitely make this experience better. The theatre is very small - maybe 200 people, so all the seats are pretty good. The performance is very interactive and they definitely pull a few people on stage throughout the performance. The seats are not that comfortable but the show isn't so long that it is too big of an issue. \nThe whole show is overtly sexual and there are a lot of inappropriate moments so if you are easily offended - this is definitely not the show for you.\nStop now if you don't want any spoilers: \nRoller skating singer - I wasn't a fan. Singing could have been better, and the roller skating was average. \nBalloon girl - I didn't really get this act. The girl was attractive and has a great body, but what was the point? \nContortionist - His 1st performance was entertaining. He is pretty funny, but the 2nd performance with stacking buckets seemed a little basic to me. \nSword swallower - had a lot of personality and was good with the crowd, but I felt there could have been more to his act. \nSecurity guard performance was probably the highlight - as it gave me a laugh and a surprise. He was great with the audience.\nHula hoop performance -  I liked this character and he definitely had impressive hula moves. You can tell he is giving 100%, but how exciting can you make hula hoops? \nThe balancing guy. His intro had me interested but the moves are pretty basic balancing... but he does bring out a cute dog - so I enjoyed that. \nDiablo performance - I don't really get this either. I had never seen this type of act before and thought it was kind of boring.
