So i have been here b4 and this place attracts lots of transients and they hang out on the outside patio alot n the buisness does not seen to throw them out or control who sits in they're patio area. Its hard for paying customers to get a seat outside because transients seem to occupy the area. This morning i got a coffee n was going to sit outside n i saw a needle under a table SMH this is so unexceptable!! I will not be lounging here ever. Drive thru for me from now on..and note this, i go inside to let an employee know but she notifies another employee n that employee comes outside about half the way to the patio looks around does not see it because it is under a table at the end of patio and instead of walking to the end of the patio she goes half the way n then goes bak inside thus leaving an exposed needle under the table. Mind u this is arizona people use flip flops alot so i hope no one get hurt by this.
