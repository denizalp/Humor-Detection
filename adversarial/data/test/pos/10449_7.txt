I'm not sure how I feel about this place...\n\nIt's the closest Asian market to me so obviously I go often..but they lack several things I look for in a market.\n\nNow, I'm no lush, but I like to wind down with a beer or two and soju on occasion. Soju is no where to be found here -1*, they carry legit Japanese brewed Asahi, +1*.\n\nI get they are catering to many nationalities, +1*,but sometimes you really just need to focus on a couple and do them right. Their Hawaiian section is laughable and highly overpriced (amazon will deliver to my door cheaper) -1*, and they have similar items scattered around to serve the different nationalities. Does soy sauce really need to be on 4 different aisles?\n\nThey carry some hard to find items and carry a decent Japanese rice brand which was their saving grace for me +1 big*...\n\nSo they meet the mark, but I prefer their West valley location.
