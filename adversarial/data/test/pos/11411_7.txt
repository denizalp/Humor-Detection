My brother wanted to check this place out since it recently opened, as he had been to the Tempe location. I'd never been so this was new for me, and I noticed it had cool neighbors like Baked Bear, Pita Jungle, and Coconuts Fish cafe, 2\/3 which are bookmarked for me to try. We came in on a weekday afternoon and there was only one customer waiting for their order. We decided to get drinks from their coffee and tea menu: 16 oz Thai milk tea with coconut lychee jelly and a 16 oz coffee horchata with regular boba. Our toppings were free with our Yelp checkins. I also ordered their garlic noodles with fried shrimp in conjunction with my drink since they have $10 lunch special from 11-3. I paid for our items and we waited for our drinks and entree.\n\nI realized my total seemed high for what we ordered, so I checked my email receipt and saw that I was charged $3.50 for the shrimp when the lunch special clearly says \"garlic noodles with shrimp\" in the title. I let an employee know and he refunded me that amount. Gotta be careful! Glad I got an email receipt so I could double check. The dish was fine, lots of garlic flavor but I would've preferred uncut noodles and the shrimp were messy and hard to peel. I will probably order one of their Hot Cheetos food items next time. I did like my drink and my brother enjoyed his as well.
