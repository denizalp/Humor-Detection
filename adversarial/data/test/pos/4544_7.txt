I come in here to hang while the fiance plays hockey and I must say, they're ALWAYS super friendly and welcoming! I love being able to have a beer or cocktail while watching the guys on the ice! It is also much warmer in the tavern than on the bleachers! ;) They recently hired a new addition to the team (I totally forget his name, darn!) and he is willing to whip up anything that your heart desires; homemade salad dressings, loaded fries--which are amazing might I add!, wings, etc. He even offered to muddle some cucumber into my gin and tonic for a light and refreshing twist! I will absolutely be back soon to hang! Thank you for always putting a smile on my face!
