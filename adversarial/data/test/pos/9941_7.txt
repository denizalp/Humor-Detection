I came here to try their hot pot with my friends because I heard it was good here. I ordered the beef combination hot pot for $17.99. It came with a good amount of beef, some cabbage, fish ball, enoki mushroom,  tomato, tofu, corn, imitation crab, thin small noodles, and a bunch of lettuce which I didn't eat any of the lettuce because I don't think lettuce is good with hot pot and they just put lettuce in there because it's cheap and fills the plate. I definitely think they should remove the lettuce from the hot pot plate because it doesn't go with hot pot. I got the spicy broth and it was delicious. Broth was good and the level of spice was just right. I also liked the dipping sauce they give you. I dipped everything in the sauce. The hot pot can be shared but I did finish it all by myself. The service was quick and good when we sat down but after we got our food they never came back to check on us and it took them forever to come give us our check. They were short staff and it was busy for a Friday night. Pretty sure everyone comes here to eat the hot pot special. I don't think I would try the other dishes here.
