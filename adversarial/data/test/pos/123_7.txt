This place is great!\n\nI may go 5-Stars, but I've only been there once. I'll be back, so I may reassess. \n\nWhat I like:\n- FOOD was great. More below. \n- Service was friendly. Warm even. \n- Setting is cool. Very clean and fresh inside what must be an old building. \n\nTHE FOOD:\nMine was great. I got a Raymond Burger, which is a pretty standard, large cheeseburger, with shredded lettuce, tomato, and \"special sauce.\"  \n\nIt was served with a hand full of wavy chips and a huge dill pickle (that was excellent, I might add).  It was served very hot (my preference), on a pretty basic bun, but the bun was warm and very soft, obviously fresh. While there is no \"secret ingredient\" to this fairly standard burger, the execution was top notch. The beef was cooked medium well (trace of pink), and was very juicy. Excellent. \n\nMy side salad was surprisingly large and also very fresh and crisp. Comprised mostly of field greens, it did have some nice olives, cucumber slices, and other food stuff I can't remember.  It came with a house vinaigrette that worked well. \n\nI see lots of all-day breakfast items on the menu, as well as lots of other sandwiches and burgers, so I need to go back and try more. \n\nI definitely can recommend this place quite highly.
