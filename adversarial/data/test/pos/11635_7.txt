This is another one of my \"4 with a Warning\" reviews.  The Eton House is a nice old divey bar that has been around for ages and has become known for being a Newfie bar for the Danforth area.  It's far from classy, it's pretty rough, it has colourful regulars, and I completely adore this place.\n\nOne of the telling signs that this place has been around for ages, is the separate tavern-entrance for ladies, and the floor-length urinals that grace the Gents.  The tap list is fairly simple with the pint of the place being Cool on tap for something like four bucks in all.  The kitchen and menu provide basic fare.  I've no idea what the actual kitchen itself is like, but they've got a green sticker displayed so it must be doing something right.  Pool tables are found in a separate room that supported the tavern's smoking area but is now without windows so you are able to see and here all that happens in the bar.  Tuesday's are the comedy nights that often have more people shouting at the stage than from it.  It can be crazy, but it is never boring for sure.\n\nNot first-date friendly.  That is of course unless you are looking to impress your date who's from The Rock...and I'm not referring to a Sean Connery film here.
