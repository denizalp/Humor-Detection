Finally made my way over to this place around the corner since I was craving some french toast. The pictures always looked good, so that's what always attracted me. \n\nThe place is awesome. The service, the food, the building...loved everything.\n\nWe had the - \nTartine: Open-faced Sandwich, Eggs, Potatoes, Canadian Bacon, Hollandaise, and Asparagus. \nThis dish was very very good. It honestly doesn't look very appetizing, but it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. \nStuffed French Toast with Raspberries and Peaches. \nIt was a little different than I expected, but it was still very good. It's pretty much like bread pudding sprinkled with powdered sugar and syrup. \nChocolate Croissant.\nIt was a lot better than it looks as well. We were trying to decide between that and the Cheese Danish and the server recommended the chocolate. I will try the Cheese Danish next time. \n\nOverall, everything was excellent. I loved the lady that was there, we thought she was Lulu, but to our disappointment, she was not. She is so friendly and warm, you just want to give her a big hug.\n\nI recommend this place to anyone looking for some good breakfast or pastries. I can't wait to go back and try more things!!
