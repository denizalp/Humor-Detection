I came here for lunch on Mother's Day and was very pleased with food and service.\n\nThey had a special menu on Mother's Day and let me tell you their blood orange mimosa tasted sooooooo gooooood. I think they used freshly squeezed orange juice. (Or that's how I tasted...)\n\nI ordered pizza from the mother's day special menu.  Roma Tomato, Spinach, Arugula & Feta Cheese Pizza. Oh the cheese on this pizza was so good, and quite filling. After eating about 2\/3 of it, I was full.\n\nFriendly service, our server was just pleasant. Nice surprise was a complimentary appetizer gift card and a piece of chocolate for mother's day. I thought it was such a nice gesture.  Now I have this coupon, I need to come back here again.
