I'm at the restaurant right now, I had a little bit of about three items one piece of BBQ , couple  Tbs spoon of noodles and one green shell. Everything was okay until after I asked for Salmon Sushi to be made. They made me five is the sushi salmon. Out of the five I ate the rice only on one of the Sushi. Can't eat all the rice that they packed under a small piece of salmon .\n\nThe psycho owner came to me and practically scolded me for not eating the rice. To top it all, he ordered the chef to not make another sushi. \n\nThis was supposed to be a buffet restaurant. He said the food came from up above ??? WTF !\n\nI was pissed off, he reprimanded the chef. Couple of the worker came to me and apogized for the owner !\nThey said the owner has a problem !!!\n I said I'll make sure I write a review on line about how you treat your customer.\nThe arrogant owner said \" do whatever you want\"\nI'll still have the business.\n\n\nI will not come back at this place. The psycho owner\nneeds to take some kind of medication!
