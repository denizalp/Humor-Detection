Umami: \nnoun\na category of taste in food (besides sweet, sour, salt, and bitter), corresponding to the flavor of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate. ???\n\nI wasn't sure what Umami meant, so my assumption was that this was going to be an Asian fusion burger. Nope, this is just a straight up burger with truffle oil randomly thrown in the mix. C'mon, you were thinking the same thing when you heard the name, \"Umami Burger\". \n\nI came here with some friends and we started this meal off with a cornucopia of deep fried, carb loaded appetizers, Mmm Mmm my favorite. First up, the \"Smushed Potatoes\" these were ok, but a tad flavorless. They look like a mini-baked potato and be careful when eating, I tried putting a whole one in my mouth and nearly lit my tongue on fire. These little pockets of heat are best cut in half and dipped in Umami house ketchup, which I liked a lot. It's ketchup, but with a mix of truffle oil and something spicy. We also ordered sweet potato fries and tempura fried onion rings. The sweet potato fries were cooked perfect, crispy and soft and the tempura coating on the onions was light, flaky and not too heavy. Overall, deep fried goodness. \n\nOn to the star of the show. I ordered the Truffle Burger, the hat trick of truffle oil infused beefy eats. This burger has; truffle aioli, truffle cheese, and coated in a truffle glaze. This burger was super juicy and full of flavor and honestly didn't need any sauce assistance, but I still dipped it once or twice in a mixture called, \"Diablo Sauce\"? Plus the bun was super soft, like dissolving in your mouth soft. Cute side note, they adorn each bum with the letter, \"U\" which in the words of Ralph Wiggum stands for, \"Umm-believable\". After the burger entered the equation I completely forgot about the side dishes and went full carnivore. \n\nTo finalize the meal, like any good eater, we ordered and shared a dessert. This was an Ice Cream Sandwich. A snicker-doodle cookie with caramel ice cream filing. Sooooo good, a must order! \n\n- Was this the best burger I ever had? Nope. \n- Was it tasty and satisfied me? Yes\n- Would I come back? Maybe. Every once in a while. \n\nUmami is good, but the prices are a little high for a burger place, but If you haven't been here yet it's definitely worth a try if you're any kind of burger loving American. \n\nCheers.
