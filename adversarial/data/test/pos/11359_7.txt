They called me several times. Told them I don't't believe that a Las Vegas based company can complete successfully a local SEO project for Anchorage, AK! Nevada - 3,4K miles off Alaska? Please, excuse me! 411 Locals ensured me they are google partner which is a warranty for a job well done. Decided to check the google partner list and.... found they are google certified partner. That turned my point of view and I handed over to them an online task. So far, the figures are rising and it seems I am happy with the results. Even decided to check their office out and to meet my cust rep f\/f during my stay in LV.
