Well I was a loyal customer until today 5.9.14. After paying off my pawn tickets $425.00 after they had been renewed several times over the past year I inquired about my layaway that I did back in November of 2013. \n\nThe assistant manager Art told me that the lawaway was cancelled back in January. I advised Art that I was given no time limit in which to pay the layaway and get this he said he knows and that's why they had to write staff up because they were telling customers there was no time limit.\n\nI then said well can I at least use the money I already paid ($45.00) and use that towards the lawaway and just pay it off today?\n\nHe said NO because there is a 90 day layaway time limit. I advised him there was no time limit given to me. He said he couldn't prove that. I said you just mentioned that you had to write staff up because of them telling customers there was no time limit.\n\nHe then starting talking about policy this and that.\n\nKeep in mind, they cancelled my layaway in January of this year and put the two items back on the floor. \n\nWe are now in May (5 Months Later) and the two items are now on the floor for sale. \n\nStill!!!!\n\nSo instead of making the sale, clearing inventory and keeping a 3 year customer happy and coming back Art wants to hide behind \"policy\", keep my $45 and lose a customer.\n\nWho promoted Art? My God why are people in authority so afraid to make decisions that promotes your business and keeps your customers happy.\n\nIts not like I got mad and said I want my money back.\n\nI asked to use it towards the purchase and I pay it off today!\n\nI will take my business elsewhere Art and I hope your boss Edwin is very proud of you.
