Sorry but this club is amazing. We didn't wait in those several miles-long lines. Just paid the reasonable entrance fee up front with our group and had an amazing time. Saw Calvin Harris spinning on the main floor, but what I enjoyed and LOVED the most was the hip hop floor. That mist steam machine is amazing, whoever the DJ was for Friday June 6 really knew how to rock the dance floor. He played all the right songs, my husband and I had the best time at this place and have considered this place as our favorite night club. \n\nHakkasan, we will be back for you. \n\nBtw the drinks here suck. You will get diabetes from the amount of sugar and syrup they put in there.
