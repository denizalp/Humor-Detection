This place was the definition of sub-par. Boring food, generic selection, packed and noisy, with pop music(American) playing over the speakers.\n\nFirst of all, the omissions: no dumplings, no dumpling sauce, no gyoza sauce, no sweet-and-sour sauce\/sweet-and-sour chicken, no sesame balls filled with red bean paste, etc\n\nAs for what they *did* have? The sesame chicken was tough and overcooked, the egg rolls were disgusting and inedible, and the Kung pao chicken was no where near spicy.\n\nThe best that can be said of them was that their cream cheese wontons were good and the service was wonderfully attentive.\n\nDefinitely never returning.
