I love this daycare more and more each day. My daughter is 22 months and can already count and read to 10...I'm totally floored! I'm not one of those parents who thinks their kid is a genius, but I know she is getting a good education at Mountain View Preschool when she can come home and can point to the clock and read the numbers back to me.\n\nSeriously folks, bring your kids here. It's the next best place to having them at home. My daughters been here almost 2 years now and there has been minimal staff turnover and they love her like their own.
