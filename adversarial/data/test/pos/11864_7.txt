I have been here for a few events over the years and a few personal get togethers. However ever since a make over... a few years ago, the place looks pretty sharp. An eloquent decor with dark tones gives it a bit more refined demeanor.  \n\nIt used to be a bit more expensive then, now it feels less expensive, however they do have some good choices of wine, which I am fine with. \n\nYou still pay what you would pay at a lounge in a downtown hotel but this location is pretty worth it. Also with a very nice patio out back, let's not forget about that. \n\nGreat place for dates, mingling and low-key business meetings as the music is non-intrusive. I definitely recommend it. \n\nWhen it gets busy, it gets busy but unless you are hosting your own event, from a night to night basis, it will never be a problem.\n\nHighly recommend.
