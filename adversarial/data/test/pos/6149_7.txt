We came to Hotel Indigo for a YELP Makers and Bakers event and decided to have dinner here afterwards. We ordered the Cheese Board, the Meat Board, and the Black and Gold Burger with fries. Their menu shows who the local vendors are that they get their food from. I really liked that. We ordered the Cheese Board, the Meat Board, and the Black and Gold Burger with fries. \nThe Black and Gold burger was a hit with our group. It was cooked perfectly. It has a horseradish sauce that gives the burger a tangy zing. The fries were fresh cut and fresh cooked. You don't get fries like that very often. I would have liked a side of the horseradish sauce to dip the fries in. YES!  It's THAT good. \nThe Meat Board had 3 types of meat-a kielbasa, prosciutto, and a type of salami. It had a small dish of stoneground mustard. Plus it had a side of crisps. The salami was my favorite. It was the most flavorful. The board was made up with nice portion sizes. \nThe Cheese Board had a Double Blue, a white cheddar, and a 3rd choice that I can't remember the name of. Sorry. It had a nice offering of fig jam and a small bowl of honey. Like the Meat Board, it came with crisps. By ordering both boards we were able to mix and match all kinds of bites. The honey brought sweet while the mustard brought savory. \nOur server Samantha was very friendly. She told us about how great their Happy Hours (5-7pm) were great. They offer half off of their appetizers and $2 off of cocktails. She told us on Thursday nights during Happy Hour that they have live music. We definitely want to bring some friends and check that out. \nWe will definitely be coming back.
