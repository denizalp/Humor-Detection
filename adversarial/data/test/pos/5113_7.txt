We came here for dinner because we got a complimentary meal for two guests. We decided to eat here because it was closer to Excalibur and we were over there looking around. \n\nIt was the worst meal ever. Everything was way too salty and some of us ended up going to the restroom RIGHT AFTER. Doesn't that tell you something?\n\nWhat I really appreciated was they didn't have any french fries and my brother LOVES french fries so our server went to tell the chef to make us some french fries. She brought this big bowl of french fries and I really appreciate this kind gesture. The amount of fries was enormous and the fries were pretty salty but the gesture was hands down out of this world. I could not believe the kindess we got from the server. \n\nThe stars were judged solely on their food, customer service is 10 stars!
