Although I didn't purchase a timeshare from this company, I would like to share my experience in hopes that people learn exactly what they are getting into. (FYI, people are giving these timeshares away on eBay).\n\nWe where approached by a person in a suit when I entered the Luxor hotel with my wife. BTW, MGM, Mandalay Bay and other expensive casinos do not have these people in their lobbies. I've only seen them in the Luxor, Excalibur, Tropicana, and New York New York (all budget casinos compared to MGM). I would always ignore their \"free tickets\" offer because I got a bad vibes and nobody gives anything for free! But this time I just decided to play the game and score some free swag.\n\nWe were offered free tickets for a show, when we said we came with another couple they offered us 4 free tickets, plus our $50 deposit would be returned in the form of a Dinning, or Gambling voucher. They also gave us a \"free\" cruise to theCaribbean (I have the voucher for the cruise but who is going to fly all the way to Florida just for a 2 day cruise? I still haven't redeemed it and I don't plan to. You have 30 days to redeem it.). \n\nAt the beginning we where told we where just going to tour a new hotel called the Grandview, we would get a free lunch buffet (it was actually, all you can eat ham and cheesesandwiches), and they where doing it to promote the hotel and to get the word out; later on he tells us we would have to attend a timeshare presentation that would last 2-3 hours, we actually spent almost 4 hours doing the whole thing. \n\nWe picked a show but the guy said the show for tonight was already booked, so we had to pick a show for tomorrow (possibly a tactic to get you to go on the \"tour\"). We told the guy we had to ask our friends if they would be OK with attending the show. While my wife was calling, the guy told me that I should give him my driver's license so that he could hold the seats because they sell out fast (again another tactic used to manipulate us because we didn't reserve our seats until we got the voucher the next day after the \"tour\" and at the time of reservation we could pick any date and time, not the just one that was \"reserved\" the day before by the guy in suit). \n\nOur friends said yes, and we signed up for the Grandview tour for noon the next day. The guy also told us to make sure we brought a credit card with us (again a tactic to make sure they could get at least a deposit from you for the timeshare). After we left, I immediately called up my best friend Google for some advice and found out all out the timesharing tactics. I became informed and made a pact with my wife that we would not purchase anything, just get the swag and run. \n\nThe next day after the presentation and the tour of the Resort: First we where offered about 80K points for about $25000, we declined that right away. Then the manager came over, said he talked to upper management and was able to lower the price to $20000, we declined yet again. He then lowered the maintenance fee from $700 a year to $350, but we still declined. He then asked if my wife was a student, she said yes and he came back and said that he would take another $5k off as a student discount, again we declined. He gave us his final offer at $10k for 49K points and a \"free week\" if we agreed to not use the timeshare before May. We also declined this offer.\n\nDeclining wasn't very straight forward: After a while we ran out of excuses to make for not buying the timeshare. For every reason we had, they had a comeback, they where pretty good, i'll give them that. So after running out of excuses we just said NO, we ignored their questions and repeatedly said NO. They let us go to the final test. \n\nWe came to a darkened room where a lady just gave us a survey about how we where treated, we said everything was OK and she then popped out the final offer which was $5000 for 49K points and the free week. We declined without giving it a second look and we where led out to the waiting room to wait for our swag.\n\nI was expecting them to offer us a timeshare again but this time we just got out vouchers and were led to the bus waiting outside to take us back to the Luxor. The van was in pretty bad shape (the check engine like was on) and the driver drove like a maniac but we made it back in one piece.\n\nOverall, I would not do this again. It takes way too long just for some $25 tickets, I rather spend the time puking in the comfort of my hotel room as I recover from the crazy night in vegas and get ready for more.\n\nI have no respect for businesses and sales people that make a living out of scamming people. I don't feel bad at all. To the timeshare sales people: please find a real and respectable job.
