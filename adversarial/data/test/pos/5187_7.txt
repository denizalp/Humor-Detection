Catawba is one of those places I wanna tell everyone about but also keep it on the DL because I don't want it becoming something akin to Old Meck. No shade.\n\nSince this brewery originated in Asheville, they clearly take their beer very seriously. They have a long list of ales, lagers, ciders, and so on that will satiate just about any taste. It is a spacious brewery that greatly utilizes its indoor and outdoor spaces. I don't think there's a bad seat to be found on the premises.\n\nI decided to go for a flight that included the Ted light lime, CLT IPA, White Zombie and another that I forget. I was able to take a sip of the hopness monster (two thumbs up!) and split half of the peanut butter & jelly. The PB&J is available only by the can but they throw in a free koozie with purchase as an added bonus.\n\nAnother plus? They have multiple stalls in the ladies bathroom! I've noticed in a few breweries (that shall remain nameless), there are at most three stalls in the ladies room. Sorry that's just unacceptable and thankfully that's not an issue at Catawba.\n\nCatawba does have its own private parking lot but it will fill up quickly on the weekend. Just to add to the charm, they have a couple of hammocks that you can choose to lay (swing?) as well as corn hole boards. Again, this is a solid brewery spot with lots to offer including a nice view of the skyline.
