I've just recently begun to explore some of the new additions to the Junction neighbourhood and was excited to try Avec Panache.  I met a friend for dinner on a Wednesday.\n\nHaving just received their liquor license, there were only two red wines and one white available by the glass.  My companion ordered the merlot and I had the cab sauv - both were good.  The menu is very reasonable - with entrees from about $10-25 and apps and desserts from $6. (The menu is available online - these prices are just from memory.)  We ordered lamb chops and moussaka, then for dessert - all were very good.  The only disappointment was that the espresso machine was not installed and I could not have an Americano with the rich, creamy trifle.  I settled for brewed coffee (which could have been fresher, but since the meal was so good and for such good value - I couldn't complain).\n\nI have reserved my comments about the service because it was so curious to me that an established restaurant owner (the folks who own Panache have a long history in Toronto) would hire the server we had.    He was not only inexperienced (which is forgivable), he was so obtrusive it became almost comedic.  In fact, it was like being served by Basil Fawlty on a bad day (minus the actual laughs).   The rudest thing he did was a doozy; we arrived at 8pm and he did not mention they were closing at 9pm.  Instead, when we got our bill at about 9:05 - he made a big show of yawning and stretching and saying it was his bedtime!  Then, he forced us to split the bill down the middle - halving it and entering the amount into the hand-held credit card machine without asking.  He also stood over us while we sorted out a tip.  For me, it was a no-brainer ($0!).  For my friend, who gets flustered a little easier - it was really upsetting. \n\nAnyways - I'm sure this guy has gone on to find his true calling, whatever that may be.  Don't let it deter you from trying the restaurant - it really was good and I will be back.  During the day.  (Hint: Not on a Wednesday).
