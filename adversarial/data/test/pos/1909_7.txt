The Ikea of crap!\n\nI had read a few interesting reviews of this place so I thought of dropping by to see what all the fuss was about. First impression was that of a dollar store.Then it kept getting worse...its a maze filled with crapy stuff , very few exits and no clear signs. The smell of cheap plastic fills the air . Soon I was hyperventilating and running towards an exit.
