This is by far my favorite tiki bar! Its bigger than most of the other tiki bars I've been to, and has such a great vibe! All the servers are SO nice and friendly, which makes a huge difference. Everyone just seems really happy to be there. They have all the usual tiki drinks, which are amazing of course. However, they also have a Dole Whip & Rum float! SO GOOD! This might be my favorite drink ever. I cannot wait to go back!
