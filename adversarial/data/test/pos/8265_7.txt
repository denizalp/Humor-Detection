The convience of taking my dog, in the middle of the night, is a FOUR star, however dealing with the lack of compassion from Dr. James O'Dea is worth giving this place a ONE star.  We took our older dog in because she was restless throughout the night and she was not able to walk due to her hind legs giving out.  We didn't know what to expect.  He wants to run all these tests to find out exactly what is wrong but with the dogs age and going through the options he made the comment that \"hydrating(with an IV) and antibiotics is provided just to humor people but he does think that works.\"  This is the method that we chose-again due to the dogs age-and it worked.\n\nOverall, the main issue is that we didn't feel any compassion from him and we left feeling antagonistic toward him.\n\nYou are better off going to the following location.  -\/vecc24.com\/vecc-east\/-  I have used them on the other side of town Trop\/Durango for my two dogs but didn't realize they had a sister location on this side of town, if I only knew.
