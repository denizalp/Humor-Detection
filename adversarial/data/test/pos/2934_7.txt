Thinking about writing this review now (we saw the show in March on a business trip to Vegas) exudes feelings of raw anger and awe. \n\nHow could a show elicit such a polarized set of emotions you ask? Let me explain...\n\nWe decide late in the afternoon to check with the hotel concierge on available shows for the evening. Pickings were slim...I am a huge fan of ballet, opera, and Cirque shows so I was excited when we could get great seats at La Reve. My husband...not so much, but he was open to it based on the reviews.\n\nI will say this...we had seats that were in the \"splash zone\" described to us as accidental based on how the actors enter the water. Fine...I'm sure it will be fine.\n\nRight? Oh so wrong.\n\nThe show starts out with a bang and we are immediately immersed in the production...I mean...these seats are great and I am totally thrilled!\n\nThen it happens. At one point the actors are standing on a ring with fire and they are slapping the water and yelling.\n\nAnd then I see it happening like a slow motion car accident...this douchebag actor SCOOPS up water aiming it straight at us...looking straight at us...AND WE'RE SOAKED. I mean hair wet, makeup running down my face soaked. Not splash zone but full on Shamu soak zone.\n\nYou know when something crazy happens you look around like...did that really just happen or am I crazy? Everyone's face said it...that really just f*ing happened.\n\nI am literally in shock. Do I jump over the rail and punch him? Do I complain? Do we leave? Ahhhh\n\nWe ended up moving seats...up...waaaay out of the splash zone. The experience was far less enjoyable...partially because we were soaking wet, partially because the show had a very strange ending and partially because sitting so high up was not as interactive (pre Shamu soak zone).\n\nWould I recommend it...probably not because of our experience. I think the production value is great although the ending was like a strange CeLo Green music video. \n\nIF you do opt to try it out, I recommend sitting 4 rows up from the front...close to the action but out of Shamu's wake.
