I admittedly picked this restaurant solely on the numerous, positive Yelp reviews, but went with a skeptical eye -- good steak in Vegas?\n\nJust outside an indoor fountain at Caesar's Palace that houses a Gelato shop, the restaurant looked great and elegant on the outside. We were seated immediately outside and ordered many appetizers, Single Malts (alcoholic drink), and main dishes.\n\nThe waitress was cheery and recommended a seafood appetizer sampler that contained oysters, King Crab legs, and Rock Crab legs. The oysters were very tiny, but the King Crab legs were absolutely delicious!\n\nFor the main courses, most of us tried the waitress-recommended Bone-in Rib Eye. Comparing it to the steaks we had at Mesa Grill (Caesar's Palace) and Bouchon (Venetian), this was our absolute favorite steak of the week-long trip! Bouchon, by the way, isn't recommended by us for steak.\n\nThis restaurant was on my mind all week-long despite other good places we went to, such as SambaSushi (Palazzo) and Pho Kim Loan (Chinatown).\n\nCome here for the Bone-in Rib Eye steak and the King Crab legs!
