I have so many fond memories of this (Biltmore) and the Kierland Cheesecake Factory locations from many years ago... Back in the day, I didn't mind eating at chains, but now when I dine out, I prefer to eat at more locally owned establishments.  That being said, there's always a time and place for a visit to a chain.  One of those times was last week, when my husband and I were gifted a Cheesecake Factory gift card from my parents (thanks Mom and Dad) in honor of our anniversary!\n\nWe took the kids and headed over and I was admittedly excited.  I told my kids about the large menu, the fabulous food, the tasty lemonade, and the delicious desserts... \n\nWe were seated on the side patio upon request, which was great, and we had a decent experience.  The reason it was decent (3 stars) and not all that (5 stars)?  \n\nWell... the service wasn't as friendly as I remembered it being.  It was also on the slow side.  My omelette came out wrong, so by the time they corrected it, my family was almost done with their food.  It also needed salt, which was missing from our table, but I figured it may take awhile to get, so I did without it.  \n\nEveryone else enjoyed their food, and once mine arrived, it was good, albeit it could have used some salt ;).  The lemonade was as good as I remember... go for an Arnold Palmer!  And of course the cheesecake won't disappoint.  We went for the original on our visit.  I am also a fan of their carrot cake, which I plan to get if\/when we return.\n\nThere is something for everyone here, which is the big reason to go... just keep your expectations in check and you'll be fine!
