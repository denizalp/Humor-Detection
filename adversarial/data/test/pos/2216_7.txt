Not very good at all. Went there with a friend, waited about 15 minutes for our food. It was cooked in front of us, but when we picked it up it was cold! Not to mention some tables are directly across from the rest room. A little off putting. My friend got a chicken egg roll that had a weird smell to it. She didn't risk it and threw it away. It was soggy too.\n\nI would rather go to teriyaki madness.
