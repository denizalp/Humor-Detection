Huge speed bumps! But hey, I hate speed bumps anywhere. \n\nI dig this shopping center, but dodging the soccer moms in their tank-sized SUVs gets a little old. I know it's important for you to go shopping AND go buy new yoga pants at Target, but come on. You can at least PRETEND like you were going to stop at a stop sign....and not take a 90ยบ turn at 45mph.\n\nSome good things here:\n\nTarget\nHT\nRegal 22\nKabob Grill\nFlying Biscuit\nLatest Discovery: TRUE Crafted Pizza. That place freaking rules.
