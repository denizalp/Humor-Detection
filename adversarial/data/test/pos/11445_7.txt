I dont understand what the hype is all about. We waited an hour Saturday around 10:30am. It was packed. We sat outside (after waiting for an hour outside) in the sun. Its too hot to have tables outside in the sun with no misters. We were able to sit half way in the shade after a while, but still didnt help with the heat. Service was mediocre, ran out of water a few times and had to flag people down for re-fills, ordered the omelette..... nothing but grease. Hash browns had no taste to them at all....... just really not worth the hype or the wait. I think its just busy because its a newer place in old town Gilbert. Dont let it fool you, honestly if you are going to wait an hour, it should be worth it!
