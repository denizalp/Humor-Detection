We get take out from here.  Huge well-done wings, great big juicy burgers (try it with a pretzel bun) done a perfect medium-rare or whatever temperature you want instead of your usual over-cooked hockey puck, and healthy portions.  You can tell they cook fresh ground meat that hasn't been frozen.  Never been disappointed here.  I usually get the chili verde and a bunch of other stuff but am usually too full after the chili verde to eat anything else.  By far the best fries all over town.  They stay crispy even after we get them home.  Love this place.
