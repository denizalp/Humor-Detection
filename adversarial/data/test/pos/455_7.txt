Hard working and always making sure the bar is clean and dust free, Stephen needs a promotion.  He is fantastic and even when I see him around the District, he's says hi and is so friendly.  Here he is cleaning an area that I rarely see at other restaurants.  \n\nFood is great also and I love the avocado rolls mmm!  Quick service and friendly food runners.  Perfect location.
