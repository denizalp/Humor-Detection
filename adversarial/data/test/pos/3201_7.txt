This place is a shit hole especially for international travel. The custom people are rude. Floor staffs have no fucking clue how to manage the crowd. Its chaotic like a third world country. If you stop here for a transit, you do go through Canadian custom or US custom for apparently no reason.\n\nThe airline are cool though, especially Canada Air. They got the most beautiful flight attendance I have ever seen. ;-)
