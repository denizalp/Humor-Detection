Shopping for a child's toy for my friend's two year old brought me to Toys R Us. I can't say I would ever find myself in this store for anything aside from looking for a child's birthday gift, and with good reason. \n\nThe store is organized by genre of toy as well as age group, making it much easier for people like myself to get in and out in a tolerable amount of time. The selection seemed pretty good in just about every type of toy imaginable, except the particular toys I was looking for. Go figure. I ended up walking out the door with a few items. They weren't cheap, but they weren't much more expensive than I found at other name brand stores, so I didn't feel too cheated.
