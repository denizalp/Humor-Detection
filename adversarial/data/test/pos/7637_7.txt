Sad day for me.  I've been going to Cheers since about 1989ish?  Wayyyy back.  Burgers and wings were always consistent.  Excellent.\nToday's visit, sadly, sucked.  I ordered a short Titos and cranberry, all the short glasses were broke, so I got a tall.  The cranberry is outta of gun and is super sweet so she has to water it down a little to be tolerable.  \nThere are doing something new with their kitchen and leasing it out so the food and drinks are separate. So I have to pay twice. Super inconvenient.\nNext, the food.  We ordered a new item, the street tacos. He puts this really sweet pickled purple onion on them, had to pick those off.  I was not expecting that on a street taco and I've ate tons of em.  Then we ordered regular wings, mild, extra crispy.  I've been eating buffalo wings the same way forever, that's,the way I like em.  These had a slightly sweet flavor to the hot wing sauce. Again, not expecting that.  And did not care for it. My husband thought they were good. You can go and form your own opinion.\n\nThis is just my opinion but I have been going there for their burgers and wings forever. I did not try the burger so I can't speak on that.  But I didn't like the wings or the drinks.\n\nAlso, staff needs to check their language.  I'm not a prude, but staff shouldn't be swearing out loud in front of customers.
