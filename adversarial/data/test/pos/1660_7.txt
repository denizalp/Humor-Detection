I haven't been to this Best Buy in this location in a long time but I can honestly say their customer service was SUPER helpful and actually listened to what customer needs and wants were. Compared to the Best Buy in Henderson, I felt like the staff was doing all they could to make everyone's shopping experience a pleasant and less stress with no pressure to buy anything. Deals change on a pretty much daily basis, the salesman did mention that the best deals usually come at the end of the year. All-in-all it was cool and I will be planning trips to this Best Buy in the future.
