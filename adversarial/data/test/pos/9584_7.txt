Beware!  I took my 7 yr old golden there 3 TIMES stating that my golden was achey and had a stiff neck...keep in mind that this is a dog who has accummulated many, many medals from numerous 1\/2 marthons and has never had so much as a limp.  \n\nAll 3 TIMES Dr. Howard never took a blood test!  After the 3rd visit, I was called home as my dog had 8 cluster seizures!  What from?  Valley Fever!   Half of ALL dogs in the valley will come down with Valley Fever and MOST vets, I have taked to since, would have checkd for this before anythiing else as the symptoms are so blatant.\n\nIf Howard had done a blood test and found the valley fever at the one of the first two vists, John could've been prescribed the proper meds and avoided the seizures NOT to mentoon the THOUSANDS of dollars spent at the Veterinary Neurologice Center of Phoenix (thank God for Dr. Knowles).\n\nGrayhawk never returned any of my calls, my dog went thru pure hell and the vet bills have cost us thousands!  And why?  We just heard that Dr. Howard wasn't \"on  his game\" as he was going thru a divorce.\n\nWay to go Dr. Howard..you should've relegated John to another vet if you \"weren't on your game\"!
