Definitely not my favorite buffet, but worth a visit!  You should come here for the following:\n\n- Crab Legs\n- Thai Chicken Curry\n- Fettuccine Penne Pasta\n- PRIME RIB!!!!!!!!! Yes, PRIME RIB is soooo soft and yummy. \n- bottomless beer\/wine\/coffee\n\nIt's a bit expensive for a buffet that's not even on the strip, but it's definitely spacious and clean! Oh, and it comes with great service!
