Wow. I should've known but who really cares that much about how much you are paying for a tall and long margarita. Well, I did because it was a) recommended by the bartender and b) expected more alcohol. I literally drank a whole thing of margarita mix with \"zero\" alcohol content. \n\nI really was not in the mood to argue with the seemingly busy bartender with only couple of patrons at the bar so I'll have to suck it up for not being outspoken about my unfulfilled needs. However, I could've used some loving when it came down to alcohol content.\n\nEhh ~ Senor Frog ~ con permiso mi amigo pero mucho mucho mucho margarita por favor?
