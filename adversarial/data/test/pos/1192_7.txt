Not just Franks is very near and dear to my heart. Located in the heart of downtown Concord, this location not only serves up some of the best hot dogs around, but they have a hot pretzel that melts in your mouth. For those that have a urge for a hot pretzel either amply garnished in salt, or other toppings such as cinnamon sugar, this is the place to come while experiencing the historic Center of Concord living.\nThey also have a feature that is unique to them call paying it forward, which is patrons donating hot pretzels to those who otherwise can't afford it. Hats off to not just Franks, and I'll continue to be a willing contributed to your paying it forward program.
