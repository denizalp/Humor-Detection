After working late on a Wednesday night and feeling guilty that I was part of the reason that Sophie M missed an evening workout elsewhere, I called this OTF studio to schedule us both for a 6am class the next morning.  Sophie hadn't been to any Orangetheory studios before, and while I had, this was my first visit to this specific studio.\n\nWe showed up early the next morning to fill out our paperwork and get ready for our workout.  We were warmly greeted by Katie, who was very thorough with informing us about the upcoming class, the studio, etc...  We got set up with loaner heart rate monitors and were ready to go!  It's worth noting that this studio is more spacious than some of the others I've been to and very clean as well.  \n\nWe also lucked out and scored treadmills next to each other to start, thanks to another attendee giving up her's so we could be together.  (At other studios I've visited, the other clients are not always so generous).\n\nThe class we took was hard core, and we both enjoyed it.  Taylore is an excellent instructor.  She took time to make sure we understood the instructions for every exercise and checked in with us throughout the class.\n\nI learned afterwards that OTF now offers class packages that are good at any studio for a year.  I'll likely purchase one of these to diversify my other workouts.  Thanks again Taylore, for a kick-ass first workout at this location... I'm sold!
