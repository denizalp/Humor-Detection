After spending two days in Montreal and realizing that Canadian food is not my favorite, I was ecstatic to find Chinatown and this amazing little bakery. I felt like I was in a sweet shop out of a Harry Potter book; my eyes just couldn't focus on one thing because there was just too much to look at.  \n\nNot only do they have sweets that melt in your mouth, they have a more \"practical\" hot food section, with pastries full of meats and veggies. This was the cheapest and best lunch I have yet had in Montreal. I also suggest getting some of the refrigerated treats; my favorite were the tiramisu and the mango mousse.
