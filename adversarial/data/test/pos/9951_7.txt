The service at this rather Expansive 'n  Posh Eat 'n Park near South Hills Village has shown a marked improvement since my last visit. Our server was light on her feet and missed not a single beat. \n\nLet me introduce you to BAAGB, the Black Angus American American Grill Burger. \n\nHe's got a weighty patty between two cuts of Texas Toast. Onions for days, green peppers for miles, mushrooms, 'Murikan cheese, and mustard to keep him from being too soft on the palate. He's mean. He's a patriot. He's juicy. He's Sargent Slaughter reincarnated as a sandwich, and he gets on well with EnP's fresh, crispy cole slaw, and those newfangled potato chips 'n ranch I can't get enough of.\n\nWinding down lunch after our matinee munch-fest was a classic hot fudge sundae. There's something about EnP's whipped cream and vanilla ice cream; it's thicker and richer than most. And that hot fudge just seeps to the bottom of the glass, begging to be lifted out with that long crane of a spoon. \n\nEat 'n Park: American as apple crisp, dissent, and rock 'n roll...\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=--N4ISYI-4c
