My date introduced me to the world of chewy rice noodles and boy, was it different! As I shakily walked through the door on a chilly night, I was immediately bathed in a steamy warmth filled with the scent of savoury spices. Glancing to my right, I was instantly mystified by the iPad. I turned to my date, \"Technology? In a Chinese restaurant? Whoa!\" \n\n\"It's to get into queue for seats,\" he says.\n\nLike a fat kid in a candy store, I excitedly started pushing the buttons in hopes of burning a few extra calories before the big meal. Using the machine was completely unnecessary as there really wasn't a line. But I imagine during those busy nights, this queuing system would be very efficient.\n\nWe were quickly sat down and given the menu: soup base, unlimited noodles, 10 small side dishes, meat. Cool. I closed my eyes and let fate decide what I will eat that night. Tomato soup base and lamb it is!\n\nThe waitress brought over our food with the side dishes. I poured everything into one bowl as elegantly as I could. As my hunger took over, I forgo my ladylike persona and threw on my eating cap. The first chomp of noodles sent me into a heavenly daze. My eyes glazed over. Mmmm, so much flavour. I looked over at my date's bowl and he offered up his food too - the man knows how to impress a girl. Mmmm beef. Happily, I continued slurping up the food until my stomach sent the stop signal. As my brain began to function again, each bite got more and more salty and less and less satisfying. Dang, I let myself go. I looked down - oil spots covered my shirt.\n\nSlightly embarrassed, I glanced up to see whether my date was still there. \"Wanna split a second helping of noodles? It's free,\" he says. \n\n\"Heck yeah!\" I replied thinking what luck that there was comfort food AND a great guy. \n\nThough the food is a bit pricey for what you get and you'll come out extremely dehydrated from the massive amount of salt you'll happily ingest, this is a decent place for some casual comfort food on a cold night - especially if you have someone to pig out with! I say, give it a try but don't expect mind blowing food.
