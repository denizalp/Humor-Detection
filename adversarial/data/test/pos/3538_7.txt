This is where I get most of my Asian supples. It's much larger now since they expanded about a year or two ago. Their selection is much better too and I love their ready-to-eat food and pastries. They'll have sales of popular items all the time so it helps to shop there often. I recommend checking all expiration dates before purchase because sometimes the expired food gets forgotten to get pulled off the shelf. I'm not sure if this is intensional though.
