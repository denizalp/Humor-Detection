If your truly craving some true Vietnamese food then this is the place to go!! They offer such colossal portions and the service is wonderful too. \n   However, it honestly wasn't for me, not my kind of taste. But trust me if your a true Vietnamese food lover, then this is your place of food.\n It's also conveniently located in a plaza that has other small restaurants and a grocery store!!! \n***** Have fun!!!******
