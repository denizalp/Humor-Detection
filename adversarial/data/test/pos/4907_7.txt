I USED to love it here! We spend at minimum of $60 every time we come here (we love to get a ton of food). Today was the last day I will ever buy their food. last time we ordered they messed it up, today we thought \"hmm... maybe that was a one time thing\" nope they just don't care. \n\nWe got our order, messed up the pizza, only got half the amount of wings, and no extra sauce. We called, wanted something to be done (we normally spend a lot of our money) the woman who was on the phone then put a man, who I am to assume is the manager, who questioned us. Then proceeded to yell at the woman (very professional...) then FINALLY brought us the rest of our wings.  \n\nBut don't worry... we got 5 extra wings, saved us like $1. Thank you. I was super hard up for 5 wings.
