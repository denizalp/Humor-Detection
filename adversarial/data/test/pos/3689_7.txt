This place is great for lunch, good for kids, and service is pretty fast. Their pita is served warm and it's nice and soft and chewy. My mom ordered the gyro pita with a side of the lemon chicken soup. The gyro meat was soft and very flavorful, just a little spicy. The soup was also good. My sister ordered the chicken feta salad, which she liked. I ordered the saganaki salad with chicken. My salad and my sister's salad looked exactly alike, except hers had feta and mine had saganaki cheese. Not exactly sure what saganaki is supposed to be like, this one was warm and chewy, slightly crispy on the outside, kind of like a fried mozzarella stick that's cooled down a bit so it's more chewy than stringy. It's a touch pricey for what you get, but the food is pretty good. Would come back again if ever in the area.
