Nguyen Huong always brings me on a trip down memory lane.  Back in the early 90's when the Chinese population was not invading all the various townships of Toronto - we all had to take that weekly trip down to either East or West Chinatown for all our Chinese grocery needs.  This was before TNT, Foody Mart, etc came and robbed the downtown Chinatowns for their business.  It was also before we started urban sprawling out into Markham, Richmond Hill... okay, we're everywhere!  You can run from us, but you can't hide!\n\nNguyen Huong is THE original bánh mì (Vietnamese sub) shop of Toronto.  I always thought to myself that if I were ever unfortunate enough to have to become homeless *knocks on wood* that I would for sure get my ass to a bánh mì shop.  Where else can you get full for $1?  Its a perfectly-balanced meal too... Carbs, veggies AND protein.  Can't get any better than that.\n\nWell fast forward 10 years now, and due to inflation, unfortunately, you can no longer find a $1 bánh mì.  But it is still a reasonable price to pay.  To put it into perspective a $2 bánh mì or a $4 sub from Subway?  I'll let you do the math!\n\nOther than bánh mì, they sell other Vietnamese goodies ranging from rice noodle rolls, to Vietnamese sweets such as chè dau  (sweet soup made with beans, glutinous rice and coconut milk).  \n\nI ended up picking up a tray of goi cuon(Vietnamese summer rolls).  I got a tray of 4 (2 grilled pork, 2 shrimp) which came with a hoisin-peanut dipping sauce for $3.50.  At first glance you'd think this was more of an appetizer... but they are unbelievably filling, not to mention tasty and healthy!  Of Asian cuisines, I always found Vietnamese food to be one of the healthier alternatives as they use a lot of bean sprouts, and vegetables in their dishes.\n\nIt is establishments like Nguyen Huong that make me wish I worked in closer proximity to Chinatown, so that I could have access to yummy foods for a fraction of the cost!
