Stopped in to use the bathroom and it was filthy! Inside the bathroom and out. Also the staff was too busy standing around chatting then to help me when I approached the counter to order a drink. \n\nI hadn't been into one of these places in years, they might have changed my mind about it, but they didn't. \n\nGross.
