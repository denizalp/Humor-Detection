In town for the weekend so as usual searched for a local coffee spot rather than going to the corporate giants who often give me drinks I don't love anyway.\n\nAs everyone else has said, the space itself it sleek and aesthetic. Parking was a bit difficult because there seems to be a few churches in the area and it was a Sunday. From the reviews and website I did not realize this shop was connected to a church, which I have no problem with but walked in and they were blaring the church sermons (if that's the right word). Also no problem there but it was unexpected and so loud that everyone was talking super loud to compensate. From other reviews it sounds like they usually play music so this may just be a Sunday thing?\n\nOrdered a chai latte from under the \"espresso bar\" part of the menu but seem to have just been given a chai flavored milk with no espresso so I unfortunately spent almost $5 for a drink I did not finish. Maybe a miscommunication but still a bummer since I just grabbed it and had to run and could not get it fixed.\n\nThe barista was super sweet. I would probably give it another chance but I unfortunately don't live here so it seems it'll be a one and done for me.
