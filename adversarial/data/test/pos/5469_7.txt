I stopped here Sunday about 1 PM for their lunch buffet.  It's $`10.99 and it's a good price and well worth it.\n\nI was told to sit anywhere I wanted--all the tables are for four people so I had a large table to myself.  Rani came and cleared the extra place settings and asked me for my preference of naan.  In addition, he asked me about drink other than water and I ordered and iced tea.\n\nMy first plate was a small plate with one large samosa, palak paneer, and some chana masala.  The palak paneer and chana masala had a nice zing to them but it wasn't too spicy that someone would not enjoy them.  The samosa was filled with potato and some peas.  It was very tasty and the crust was flaky.\n\nFor my second plate, I got some chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and basmati rice.  You'll notice no photo for this dish.  I enjoyed the first one so much that I just started eating and no photo.  The chicken was good.  I especially liked the chicken korma so when I went back for a third, smaller plate, I got more chicken korma along with goat curry and some saut√©ed cabbage because that seemed so different for an Indian restaurant.  All was good.  I made a final trip to have some gulab jamun to end on a sweet note.  \n\nThe restaurant is not very large but it's very pleasant.  The food is good.  I'm glad we have another option for Indian food on this side of town.  Service was very good.  I'll be back.
