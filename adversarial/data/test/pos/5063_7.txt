Fun place to hang out and unwind in Vegas. Great milk tea and large variety of selections.  It's a little farther out of the strip, so I think it's mostly locals who go here.  You have to pass the Chinatown shopping center and go down aways to that shady 24 hour massage parlor is located in that mall area.  It's a really small place though, they've got 5 tables that fit 2 each.  But they do play short kung fu movie clips on tv and some pretty nice variety of tunes from the 70's - 2000's.  The milk tea is creamy and good, so if you're in the area looking for a good boba milk tea place check it out!
