I guess you could say my first experience with Blaze was brief... which would make since given their namesake (Fast-Fire'd Pizza). The pies themselves we're great given their price-point, but the service was a bit lacking.\n\nAfter giving their neighbor, City BBQ, a try a couple of days ago, the large crowd at this new pizza joint intrigued me. I decided to skip the line and order online. Their online interface, by the way, actually works well! There are many take-out places around that have ordering apps or websites that make you believe they don't even want you ordering from them, so good on you Blaze for actually making it usable.\n\n15 minutes after placing my order, I skip the massive line (love doing that anywhere I can!) and straight to the \"Pick-Up\" register. 2 employees we're working the register and 1 appeared to be cutting pizzas specifically for pick-up orders. After repeating my name 3 times, one to each employee who each sequentially looked at the next person like they didn't belong on that register, the guy cutting pizzas said he had my order and was cutting it.\n\nI had 4 pizzas and he pointed to 2 boxes and said he was working on the other 2. Once my stack has accumulated to 4 I thought he would call me, after a minute or so I asked if they were ready. He said Yes, and nothing else. Grabbed my pizzas and walked out.\n\nThe whole \"customer-interaction\" part of the restaurant... it needs some fine-tuning here. I think if I hadn't said anything to anyone they wouldn't have batted an eye and I might still be there waiting on those pizzas! I'll dine in next time and see if things change. Who knows, it might have been a rough night?\n\nSo on to the pizzas. Their ingredient list is extensive, I bet you could make trillions of different combinations. The pizzas are 11\", a little bit bigger than your average \"personal\" pan, and hover around the $6-7 price range. They're going to make a killing off the college kids looking for value.\n\nWhen comparing them to other budget pizza offerings around, it was outstanding! Great red sauce with that had nice spicy tang at the end. Meats (I got the meatball, salami, and pepperoni on mine) were all individually distinguishable and flavorful. Cheese was generous on my pie and great as well.\n\nIf the service is better next time, I'll be the best long-term customer they have. This is now likely the closest pizza place to the house, and while I like it, I want to LOVE it! Update Pending!
