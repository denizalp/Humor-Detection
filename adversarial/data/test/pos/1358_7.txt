I don't believe this! It is 11:25 I am meeting some people for lunch. Waiters comes to me and says \"we don't open until 11:30 you can wait outside\" WTF!!!! I said it almost 11:30 they aren't cleaning anything. I had to give one star otherwise I would have gave NONE! \n\nF this place I will not come back! \n\nSomeone needs customer service training big time!
