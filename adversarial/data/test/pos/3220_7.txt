This place is ummmmmm...Are you kidding me? Missy of it's her or not or some other girl completely ignored a group of women for 10 minutes. And guess what, she was on her phone texting. Like come on. \n\nI yelled hello 5 times because the music was loud, then she has the audacity to ask me if I'm ok. And I'm like yes I'm ok and she gave me this look of absolute death. I was completely sober and I'm sorry but you sit behind a busy bar ignoring your patrons texting people. And then you sure as hell don't respond with dirty looks to paying customers.\n\nI'm not impressed with this place and there are plenty of other bars to go to where you at least get a friendly response. I'm just annoyed and the drink I ended up getting was awful. I won't be going back, the music and the scene wasn't fun. \n\nIn addition to that, they had some space theme with items from party city with blow up spaceships and cheap streamers. The people looking at this review won't even care. But I had to write it since I have a few minutes to waste on this review.
