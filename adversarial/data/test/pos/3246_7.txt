It's my second visit here in as little over 2 weeks.  The employees are very friendly and the store is very clean.  My last visit here I got my lady an awesome purse and this time we are here for some sunglasses.  One interesting thing I like about this coach store is there is a section for men.  I got an awesome coach belt for Christmas.  You know how you get a gift and just marvel over it and not want to wear it.  That's how I feel about my coach belt.\n\nThe store is pretty busy tonight seeing that it's a few days after Christmas.  You definitely have to check it out....even the fellas
