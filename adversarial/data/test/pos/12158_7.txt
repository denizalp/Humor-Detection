Food is decent but I'm not sure I ever had such bad service. The man behind the counter, who I assume is the owner, had the worst attention span I've ever seen in anyone over the age of 5. \n\nHis wife, who sat in the \"restaurant,\" continued to distract him by coming up to the desk asking for more food for herself. He would stop whatever he was working on to make it for her. It then took him an additional 10 minutes to ring us up from the time our food was finished! Absolutely ridiculous!
