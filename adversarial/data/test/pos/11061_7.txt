Once upon a time, what seemed like many moons ago, I volunteered to be a hair model for a nice salon. I was excited to get what typically costs me $$$ done for free! Except that 3 hours later, I walked out with blunt orange steps and unstyled hair. For a week, I affectionately referred to it as the stairmaster on my head. I couldn't wear my hair down because it was so bad. \n\nLuckily, I was able to find Jen at The Hair Standard! She got me in within that week and did some magic. It took 3 processes over 2 trips because I figured we might as well go super blonde while fixing the horrible blend lines and she took me blonder than ever before! She fixed some serious issues with my hair yet it doesn't feel damaged and the hours I spent in her chair flew by. She is super nice, sweet, a great conversationalist, and most importantly, she's good at what she does. There is never a dull, awkward moment. I'll definitely be back to see Jen!
