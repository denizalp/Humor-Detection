Is there anything more wrong their drinking beer at church? Yeah my pure enjoyment of the debauchery, why did my beer taste so much better in a church? Wine never does. And not only was my brew delicious it was priced right, my 2 fantastic pints were between $2.50 and $4.50 and both on point. \n\nSo as far as grub... It was way overpriced. We had Pierogies, which from my understanding are unique to the Burgh, they were delicious for four $3.25 for potato and cheese and $7.00 for Sausage and sauerkraut which was amazing. I had the Jambalaya which was pretty good, but not $18.00 good. So while the food and drink was good the price needs help, at least on the food. \n\nBeautiful Church by they way I hope you heathens enjoy drinking your wicked brew in it as much as I did.
