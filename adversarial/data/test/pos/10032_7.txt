Wow what an experience. I do give one star for ambiance. I mean this was so bad. If you saw you like it you are fooling yourself or getting paid by the owners. I went with my girlfriend and she had her ID held by Sammy for over 30 minutes when she ordered wine. We had to ask for it back with the check. The pizza was burnt on the top and bottom and raw in the middle. We both almost spit it out. When we asked for a to go box Sammy got aggressive and proceeded to ask over and over why we didn't want to eat. Since we were the only people in the restaurant on a Friday night at prime dinner hour. I avoided conflict and said I needed to get to the airport for a business trip. He continued to push until we left with our pizza to go (we left it on the patio). Thank god there is a great pita place next door we went to for dinner. If I had eaten anymore I would have been sick.
