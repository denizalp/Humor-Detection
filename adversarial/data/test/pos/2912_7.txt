59th and Bell is a bit of a food desert.  The area has the usual suspects, Mickey D's, Mexican phone company, Wendy's, Subway, etc.  Even with my high tolerance for the aforementioned slices of Americana fast food, I needed something unique on a Phoenix Saturday afternoon with the top of the Z down and the P looking cute with her red hair tucked up under a \"Got Wine?\" baseball cap.\n\nOut comes the Iphone and similar in color to the big red S on my chest, I punched the Yelp icon on my home screen.  Nearby, tucked between a Subway and Island Teriyaki is Al's Gyro's.  The P was game and so was I.\n\nDespite a very impressive menu, we both opted to go with the Gyro plate which comes with, surprise, a Gyro, a Greek salad, and a drink.  The Gyro was pure comfort food for each of us. Truly one of the best Gyros each of us have had in the Valley. The pita was terrific, the portion size is huge, and the tzatziki sauce is excellent, thick and flavorful.  The salad was tasty and authentic.  A small word of warning, the Kalamata olives are NOT pitted so don't just bite down on them, you might lose a tooth.  \n\nThe service was pleasant, food came out quickly, fun photos of old Chicago on the wall-I'll definitely return. Next time, I'm going for the Chicago dog, it might just be the ticket to up my rating to a solid five stars.  Well done, Al!
