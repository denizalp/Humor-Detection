It's been awhile since we have been here.\nI was craving some chicken wings and some fried pickles.\n\nWhat happened to this place?\n It's not the same.\n\nThe pickles we're good the few times we have had them or when they first started making them. These we're very thin and seemed to be over cooked or maybe the grease was no good.. they were not my favorite anymore. Just no good taste and over cooked.\n\nThe chicken wings? We we're impressed with the size when they came out but but but.. HOOTERS WHAT DID YOU DO?????\nCHANGING THE SAUCE!! SERIOUSLY?\nSo very disappointed. They were actually pretty gross. To me tasted like cigarettes or ashes. I am not joking.\n\nWe asked the waitress what Happened. She said they changed the sauce because people complained it wasn't saucey enough it was thick. So they changed it to a SOY based sauce instead of butter. Seriously? They are NASTY. \n\nNOTHING LIKE THEY USE TO BE.\nand they went up on the prices no wonder I read somewhere they are not doing as good as they use to do,  you don't change what worked for years!!\n\nWe loved the butter based taste. I still buy the medium sauce in the jar when I can find it. I love the original medium SAUCE. They haven't changed that yet. Hopefully they will never change it to the gross stuff they serve.\n\nBut sad to say we won't ever go back. \n10 wings, fries and pickles for about $27.00!\nNot worth that kind of money at all.\nIf the food was the way it use to be you wouldn't mind.\nOh well we did order 20 wings and it would have been more but we only ate 10 and asked to talk to manager and told her how bad it was. She did charge us only for 10 not 20. We would have left them there neither of us would have ate them.\nThat was a good thing plus the waitress we had was good otherwise it would have been one  star. \nVery dissatisfied and disappointed.
