People often say to never judge a book by its cover and this place is definitely one of those cases. The pictures, design, and the mention of \"Izakaya,\" makes H20 seem likes something new and exciting. A fresh take on AYCE sushi if you will. Upon entering it seems like everything checks out. The place is nice and clean, and the interior design is great. This place reminded me alot of Gen with it's design choices. The service was good being that it was a soft opening, there were a couple mixups by the food runners. But it's to be expected especially since they did Bogo on ayce sushi. You order through a checklist and you get 3 rounds, we decided to order a lot the first round getting whatever looked good. There were already warning signs on the menu when I realized nothing really stood out, and the \"Izakyaka\" was basic appetizers you can get from any ayce sushi place. When the food came out, my lowest expectations were shattered. \n\n Every roll and nigiri tasted liked nothing. The basic hallmarks of sushi is One. How fresh your fish is and Two. The quality of your sushi rice. When you miss on both, how does one find the audacity to even serve something like this? Salmon, Yellowtail, and Tuna. They all have distinctive tastes and yet all I tasted was dry meat while some were chewy when they had no reason to be. The fish to rice portion is great, big fish small rice. But when I tasted the rice I realized it was a means to distract someone on how terrible their rice is! It tasted nothing and the rice was choppy and falling apart. Not from sauce or anything mind you. 3 rolls, 12 pieces of nigiri, and all their special \"Carpaccio.\" ask me about the difference and I wouldn't be able to tell you. It was the first time where I was still hungry and my mouth didn't want to swallow the food, yet I had to force myself to finish so I wouldn't lost any more money to this place. \n\nThe \"izakaya.\" I know izakaya simply means small dishes and stuff but when most Japanese spots around here throw out the word Izakaya it usually means something. The takoyaki was literally a fried donut with an octopus smaller then a dime.  The jalepeno poppers were shrunken pieces of jalepeno with a little spicy mayo on top, and the tuna crispy rice was basically tempura batter.  Places like Go, Kyara, Hachi, Raku, and Ichiza are definitions of what real izakaya is or aspires to be, the fact that they even went out of their way to add Izakaya to their name is a disgrace. \n\nThis is the type of place people bring first time sushi goers and leave with them never wanting to ever try sushi again. It's a blatant million dollar cash grab with it's nice designs attempting to trick you into thinking the food here has to be good and maybe it's just you. Yet the putrid mediocrity of everything made here quickly brings ones to their senses. Upon walking out we witnessed multiple tables with hands over their mouths holding the food back, or couples looking in horror at a table full of trash that they somehow have to find a way to finish. And of course this place ends everything off with a home run by giving my girlfriend and I food poisoning. Curled up next to a toilet. What a way, to end a lovely night.
