NO MEAT HERE!! Didn't know that because they trick you coming in. The line started in the sale portion of the buffet. Then you stop to pay. Then you venture around finding out there is no protein. Did not know I would be paying 25.00 for me and my daughter to eat a vegetarian dinner. I came in starving thinking I was going to fill up!!.. well that didn't happen!! When I asked the manager he said they have been meat free for six years??? What a disappointment. Ended up at chipotle with a mostly chicken bowl.
