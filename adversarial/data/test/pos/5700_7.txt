Big enough to have several options for services and different ministries, but small enough to still have folks say hello because they recognize you're not a regular.  I grew up in this church, and while I've moved to a different part of town, and a whole different church, my mom still goes here and I still visit from time to time for different events.  \n\nThey have an interesting cross section of folks based on their location.  Some apartment and barely holding it down folks with some \"I live in a fancy house and drive a fancy car\" folks.  While they have a pre-school program, I can't really speak to it from experience but based on my history with the church I would certainly expect that it's done well.  \n\nIf you're not a big attendee, but just want a place to go for those church-y times of year - it's not a bad spot to go.  Some services are more traditional, and some are \"contemporary\".  At least as close as you can get in a Lutheran church...
