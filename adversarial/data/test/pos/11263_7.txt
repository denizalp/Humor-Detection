I'm probably one of the few people (if any) who don't like their macarons (I think their macarons are the worst in town). What I came here in search for was kouign amann. I was dying to try this and I was so excited that they had it. So, I bought two. Who wouldn't love a crusty, doughy cake containing layers of butter and sugar folded in? Also had them throw in a couple beignets, raspberry filled. Delicious! Yes this place is overpriced, but it's a strip venue, the name Thomas Keller attached. What do you expect? I didn't complain, it was worth the 10,000 calories.
