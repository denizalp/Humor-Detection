Bummed came from Maui to bring back gifts.  Store is extremely limited out of sizes. Was hoping to buy shirts w\/the Tiki not the limited items they had. Sales girls were very nice and helpful but if you are wearing a hat and it does not get released til Wednesday.  U shouldn't be sporting it if a customer  can't buy it.  Won't be back to the store. - so not worth it.
