What a nice little hidden place this is.\n\nMany do not know this but once upon a time, I used to really love sweets. Big on cheesecakes, pies, cakes, small pastries... although never about cookies. They are soulless, buttered treats that are meant to kill you. :-P\n\nAnyway, I stopped eating sweets a few years ago, in fact I just recently had a chocolate bar after... Wow, almost 5 years. Damn you Halloween induced peer pressure! \n\nI digress, this little spot in Korean town is fairly unique as nowhere else in town can you get these tasty little pastries filled delicious walnut, red bean or potato filling.  \n\nPersonally I have tried them all and the red bean, is not my favourite as I rather prefer the other flavours, the walnut is my favourite and the potato is alright. When I go I mostly get the walnut filled ones. \n\nThey also sell Korean flat pancakes which is not anything like its savory Japanese cousin but if you do get it, eat them warm. Just like pastries, they really do shine when fresh and loose a little bit of their luster as they cool. I have noticed they make the snacks throughout the day and late afternoon, the pancakes seems like they make them constantly.   \n\nThey do not have a lot of space so if you want to snack in, well, just be aware they are short on space, and tables and chairs. Personally I pick to go.\n\nThe owner is very friendly and during my first time there, I mentioned that I would be back and asked at what time they close, at which point she gave me her card and said: \"We close at 10:00pm but if you are coming, just call in and I will keep the store open.\" I am sure she meant within reason but that is insanely good customer service to have even offered. The type I have seen in other parts of the world but hardly ever here. You can feel that she enjoys what she does. \n\nOn that alone she has a new customer in me, not to mention they are great snacks.\nCheck them out.
