It's a smaller venue, really fun & entertaining show!  My only complaint is please do a friggin better sound check.  Way to loud.  Look I'm not old I've been to concerts with 120 DB.  I wish I would of used an app to record how loud.  \n\nWhen it's so loud you can't understand what the guy is saying it's frustrating to watch!  \n \nI almost walked out \n\n Please work on that
