Why did the chicken cross the road? Every table at Chicken Shack was full so I took out my chicken and crossed Mountain Vista Road with it to the Ethal M. Cactus Gardens picnic table. So much for my joke, here is my review of Chicken Shack. It is based on my two recent lunch time visits that were on July 9 and today. \n\n   Chicken Shack is a small restaurant in the Smith's and Barley's Casino-anchored Shopping center that has masses of people shocking to the southeast corner of Sunset and Mountain Vista. The two times that I have shocked here in the mid afternoon, the place was packed. Today, I barely landed a table when a couple left. I came close to having to take it out to Ethal. M Cactus Gardens for an impromptu picnic. The reason that Chicken Shack is so popular is that they serve quality food at prices that won't burden the wallet in an upbeat environment. \n\n  It is funny that many of the hole in the  places that I have dined in are the most fun places to dine in. Chicken Shack is a quintessential example. Adorning the walls are humorous quotes related to chicken jokes, the Chicken Shack mascot that reminds me of a yellow version of Foghorn Leghorn, and license plates from all over. Supposedly every state licence plate is represented on these walls. Here is an example of one of the humorous quotes on the walls of Chicken Shack: \n\n   \"In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road and that was good enough.\"  Grandpa\n\n  What is not a joke is the food. And plenty of food! On both of my visits I'd order a combo. The combo includes shoestring fries and a Pepsi fountain beverage. In response to the previous Yelpers stating that the shoestring fries were good, I say \"Ditto.\" \n\n  On Friday, July 9; I ordered six chicken wings dipped in a hot garlic honey sauce. The price of the meal was $9.95. If I opted for one of the sundry dipping sauces, I'd pay an additional 50 cents. After taking my $ and name, they brought the food to my table a few minutes later. Sharing the table with the chicken wings combo was a roll of paper towels. They were necessary. These chicken wings were the stickiest finger food that I remember eating in a long time. This might go down as the stickiest finger food or thing that I reviewed on Yelp. I got extraordinary use out of the paper towels. With that said, Chicken Shack chicken wings and texting is a bad combination. When I got past the consistent reaching back and forth to the paper towels, the chicken wings were all right. They were loaded with  white meat and flavor. \n\n  Today, I ordered the chicken sandwich combo for $6.99. They gave me a choice between crispy and grilled. I chose grilled. It was worth the long wait. This leads into me recommending passing over Chicken Shack if your in a hurry. This isn't a fast food joint where the chicken is sitting under a lamp. When the chicken sandwich arrived, I was like, \"Wow.\" The sandwich was stuffed with three mutant chicken fingers, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes next to a large portion of shoestring fries. Two of the pictures below show the giant sandwich. It is safe to say that I did not leave hungry. \n\n   In the future I conceive visiting Chicken Shack to put their chicken fingers to the test. Ideally this will be at their Boulder City location after hiking. In the present I give Chicken Shack my 4 star stamp of approval.
