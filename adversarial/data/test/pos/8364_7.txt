Sorry, Phoenix location...after all was weighed out and a huge discussion...Glendale puts the boot on and knows what to do with it. I think this one converted most of that boot into real estate for Mother Goose. UGH...the parking is terr-id, the food is above phenomenal and the service sucks....what to do. Geez, I mean I HATE to do this to such a quality food place but everything was so frustrating about this morning. We pull up, no parking...end up putting my boyfriends MLC car on the street...gasp, its next to a homeless pretty sure 2 brain celled and sucking on Tide Pods dilapidated shirtless, shoeless walk of life. No good. The service, seriously I can't say much because  it did not exist. I actually got up and went to bar to locate how we were going to wet our whistle...the salsa is beyond the best, the meat, the marinades and the quality is above and beyond the absolute best! Best pibil I have ever enjoyed and the tinga is amazing...seriously GLENDALE, GO.  I just hate the parking, lack of service and the cramped restaurant with a bar that has no bar stools and ...oh wait I got it!!! the server and the parking spaces are the same...they don't exist....damn.
