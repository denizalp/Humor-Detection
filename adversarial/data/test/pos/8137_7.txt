One word - unexpected. On the surface a place that tags itself as an \"ultra-dive bar\" with a hot dog and taco menu, a mechanical bull, beer pong and a pool table has little appeal to me.  But it's also in the Venetian which usually means a snooty bartender will take 9 minutes to make a 13 ingredient, $21 martini. Expensive \"celebrity\" chef snoots-ville is a Venetian specialty.  However this down to earth little gem is in the Venetian and nothing is infused, crushed or foamed and that suits me just fine.  \n  \nIt was really fun, the music was great, the food was scrumptious and because it is in the Venetian I didn't have to get a hep-c vaccine or up my hobo-stab insurance to brave some sketchy parking lot to get there.  \n      \nFood wise what I would expect from a bar is some crappy frozen, reheated garbage on a plastic plate.  It was on a plastic plate but it was fricking delicious.  Under protest I tried the mini chili cheese hotdogs.  Chili and cheese usually gives me heartburn and because I don't really like chili cheese hotdogs it's not worth it so I avoid them.  But I tried these and they were so good I went back a couple days later and ordered them again, this time armed with a handful of Tums to maximize enjoyment.  And they have soft-serve ice-cream - yum.   \n\nWhat was also unexpected is that admittedly on the surface I appear to be a \"corporate type\" and I thought this place would be full of \"dirt-bag types.\"  It wasn't.  The crowd ranges the socioeconomic spectrum which makes for a great atmosphere.  There were a few more English dudes there than I would have liked, but I also think there was some weird convention that week. \n   \nThere are a couple of things to be aware of.  There was prolific use of a smoke machine by the DJ - a little The Beach circa 1999.  If you have a couple drinks and then become tempted to get on the mechanical bull, think twice.  I saw a couple of ladies scamper on that thing and it was not hot.  More like awkward dry-humping.  But in those ladies defenses they did appear to think they looked pretty sexy.  Also some of the cocktail waitresses' outfits were not the most becoming (i.e. pudgy stripper).  Maybe someone should have an uncomfortable conversation with a couple of them, but I was told by my male companions they were all hot and I was crazy. \n\nHighly recommend.
