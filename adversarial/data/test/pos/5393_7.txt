'It's got a thin candy shell. I'm surprised you didn't know that.'  If you get my tommy boy reference, you passed the test! \n\nI'm pretty sure we've all enjoyed a bag or two of M&M's.  They created a store around the fun loving characters with 4 floors of merchandise.  I think kids go crazy for this store.  Parents go crazy but in a different way. Ha!  Just about any type of gift, houseware or clothing item can be found M&M style within this store.  You also can't miss the rainbow wall of candy to pick and choose which color and which style of M&M you want.  The price per pound on these are jacked way up so beware.  \n\nService here is pretty helpful.  There are plenty of people on each floor and they all asked us if we needed any assistance.  There are also registers on each floor which makes it easy to check out.  \n\nVisitors always enjoy coming here but it is a wild child zone. You've been warned!
