We are restoring a 1962 Shasta Travel Trailer, and I took it here to have the bearings in the axle repacked and sealed, for long excursions, and just because it's so old. Extremely friendly & knowledgeable service people, very trustworthy and thorough. My bearing have an older type seal, and rather than putting the old one back on they searched around town for the new, old style, to do the job correctly. Seems they work on anything as well, from giant, 300-thousand dollar motorhomes to travel trailers, campers, pop-ups, etc.
