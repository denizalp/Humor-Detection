On the days when I pick up my daughter from North Phoenix, we typically go for ice cream of some sort. More often than not, we end up at Desert Ridge Mall, where we encounter Puro Gelato.\n\nThe selection is good, having at least 20 different flavors of gelato\/sorbet. The portions are nice, as well. We never get more than a small (one scoop), though they do have four different sizes.\n\nCompared to other gelatos I've sampled, Puro's is decent. It is definitely delicious. It's extremely light and fluffy...though, it's not as thick as some of the confections at other places we've sampled.\n\nIf you're at Desert Ridge and you're looking for a decent frozen treat, you should try Puro Gelato. It's by far the best option from which to choose at the mall.
