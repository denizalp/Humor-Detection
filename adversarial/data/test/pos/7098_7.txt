Thanks to Annie M. we stumbled across The Q&B for a little post-class drink. What a cool space! Head upstairs when you walk in, and choose either a comfy couch, arm chair or what feels like gathering around a kitchen table. This was just the right atmosphere to catch up with friends over some very unique beers. Quiet crowd but a good vibe!\n\nAmongst our group we ordered some German wheat beer and a few types of cider. I had the Ontario Spirit Tree cider, which was delicious. A little pricey at $11 (taxes included), but a decent size at least. The menu was also fairly expensive, burger and fries for $17, and they didn't have a HUGE selection, but the food is supposed to be delish.\n\nNext time I'd love to try the Canadian cheese platter (1 for $6 or 3 for $16), the frits OR their homemade icecream. Some of the flavours were Baileys-praline, raspberry ripple, and other delicious (and alcohol infused) frozen flavours!
