Hi had awful service at this place. The first guy Ben was very kind. When I walked in I showed them a picture of what I wanted and asked them if they could do it they said sure sure sit down. After an hour and 45 minutes and three different people working on my nails to just do one design on each and it looks terrible and I made it clear that it look terrible. After three people tried multiple different times to get the design right I had to go I could not waste any more time so I asked her just to make the nail a solid color and she painted directly over another color with a different color. Then she gave me attitude because I told her I would not pay full price for piece of crap nails. Do not go here they are very rude and disrespectful it is so not worth it. I now have to pay somewhere else to do the job right.
