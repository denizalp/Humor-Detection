I want to start by saying the golf course is a 4 star rating, and the restaurant staff was very friendly. The service failure by Tom in the pro shop was to much for me to overlook however. As I walked into the pro shop, Tom was dealing with a customer that was complaining about being overcharged on his credit card for a belt he had purchased the week prior. At the time, Bear's Best was running a special for $59 which included a free drink and a coupon for a play at the $59 rate in January 2012. I paid him for my round with three twenty dollar bills. He gave me my receipt and I asked him for my dollar change. He began getting defensive and told me he thought he already gave it to me. I told him, no he didn't - so he begrudgingly gave me a dollar. I went out to my golf partner and told him of the bizarre behavior I had just witnessed. My partner then asked me if I had received my free drink card and replay certificate. I said no I hadn't and headed back into the pro shop. When I politely asked for the free drink card and replay certificate, he said he had already given me one. I told him he hadn't and he became really belligerent towards me. I was really shocked. I did note the security cameras in the shop and asked him to go check his security footage. Tom then stated he didn't have access to the footage, but he would \"give me another one\". I was getting upset at this point, and I pointed out to him, he wasn't \"giving me another one\" but rather the one he failed to give me the first time. I then told him he could read about my encounter with him on Yelp. Tom stated he had no idea what I was talking about. Unless you are getting a great deal you can't pass up to play Bear's Best, I would suggest going to Siena Golf Club or Arroyo Golf Club right next door, or Angel Park a few miles away.
