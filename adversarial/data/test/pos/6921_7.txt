As a fan of Cirque shows, I was very pleased with Mystere.\nThe fat baby, the homo-erotic balancing act, and those pole-climbers were the show stealers for me.\noh, and that guy who was doing the cube twirling (he'd be awesome at a rave! haha!!).\n\nWhat i did NOT like was that pre-show jerk who was throwing pop-corn on people. While the majority of the audience was laughing in hysterics, I thought it was pretty rude and it got old after the first 5 minutes.\n\nThis is my only complaint about the show. Other than that, I would definitely see it again. \n I am always left in wonder and amazement after Cirque du Soliel. And how cute were those teeny-sized dancers? \n\nxo-\nandrea
