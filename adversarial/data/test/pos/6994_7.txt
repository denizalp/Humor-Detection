Had a wonderful foot massage which included a back\/neck\/scalp\/arm massage as well for 1 hour.  All for around $36.  Save your money - don't bother going to the massage places in the expensive Strip resorts - drive a little off the strip and save some big money.  In terms of bang for the buck, this massage has it all over the really expensive massage that we had at the Canyon Ranch spa a few days ago
