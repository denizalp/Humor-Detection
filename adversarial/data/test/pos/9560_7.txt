Went in to try to trade in my truck on a lower priced vehicle. The sleazy little finance man in the Mr. Ed shirt came out to tell me what he could do. He basically told me that he gets my vehicle at auction all day long for far less than I owe on it, I could tell by the abundance of them he had on his lot. He said between what he could give me and his STICKER price, he couldn't work with me. I got up to leave and the manager had my keys in the back. I asked him to go get them and then he tried to stall me, after he and his manager talked for a few minutes and then came back to try to hike up the payment I was willing to make as high as he could, I gave him my top payment amount and 10 minutes later came back to hand me my keys. These people are so shady. I needed a shower after leaving that place. \n\nIf they can't screw ya, they don't want your business. And that ain't no bull!!
