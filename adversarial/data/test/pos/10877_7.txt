Wish my city had a 24 hour specialized poutine joint. Had to check out La Banquise having heard it is #1 in Montreal. Not bad, not bad at all.\n\nHad their La Fred Caillou poutine, that came topped with four different meats, and the regular portion was more than enough for one (mind you, I had just eaten dinner elsewhere).\n\nWas it special? No. Was it tasty? Heck yeah. Beware of the line ups, it was already a packed restaurant on a cold snowy day, although we were lucky we only had to wait a little while.
