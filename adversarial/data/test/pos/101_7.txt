Wait, what? The best poke shop in Vegas is now on Stephanie in Henderson?! Poke Express is the same amazing poke shop you've probably already had inside Island Grill on Eastern. With the change in location and (finally!) their own place the Poke spot is more convenient and will finally get the attention they deserve. \nIf you haven't had poke before, it is all raw fish. Order it by the pound and order a side of rice (you can even get furikake on the rice on request!) I find a 1\/2 pound order with one order of rice to be a pretty filling portion for lunch. At just over $8, it's a great deal. I've had the shoyu poke, oyster sauce poke and the spicy tuna combo. Don't let the word spicy turn you away- I'm a weakling when it comes to spiciness, but I was more than okay with it! The restaurant also sells your usual Hawaiian shop frozen foods (bao, gyoza), drinks (Hawaiian Sun, Arizona teas) and Asian sauces (Yoshida sauce!!!!!!) There are no seats inside the restaurant so take it to go! But don't worry, poke doesn't have a strong fishy scent so you'll still be able to eat it at work ;)
