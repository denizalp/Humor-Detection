The food was excellent and the atmosphere was second to none.  It is certainly classier than the Casino hotels - no smoky bars, loud people, or lurking hookers. The service was super-attentive, well groomed, and well mannered.\n\nI stayed at the Cosmopolitan and wish that I had opted for Trump Tower. I didn't see the rooms but I saw enough to get an idea of what I was missing. \n\nOh, yeah...  I almost forgot:\n\nTRUMP 2016!!!!!!!!!!!!!
