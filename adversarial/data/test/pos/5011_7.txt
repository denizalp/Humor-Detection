I LOVE LOVE LOVE Mood Swings!  I've been going here for years and I've never had a bad experience.\n\nAnd I can not say enough about my current \"stylist\" Abrelle (sp) ... she's F'n GREAT!  And get this!  You'll never believe it, but when I get my hair cut ... she puts 100% of her concentration into cutting my fucking hair!  Novel I know!  \n\nI mean, I never have understood why people think that their hairstylist should be interested in their mundane personal lives, and I absolutely hate small talk.  Abrelle fuckin' rawks.  She says \"Hi, what are we doing today\" and then cuts my hair and gives me the most wickedly great massages (scalp and hand, she used to start with a neck massage to but some how that's been lost, but you know what?  That's not her job so, so be it.), but I'd pay the $40 just for the awesome scalp and hand massages she gives.\n\nOh yeah ... she also cuts hair like a champ!  Abrelle FTW!
