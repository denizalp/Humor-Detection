When my boyfriend and I were trying to find a Mexican place for dinner, we stumbled into this place in a strip mall. I mean we stumbled in because the roads are tyical of Shaker, goes it 14 directions simultaneously. But boy am I glad we got here!\n\nThe food portions are not just big, they're epic! We ordered fajitas and the Los Haberneros sample platter. OMG. We had leftovers for three days. The re-fried beans were extra tasty and they did not cheat us at all with the amount of meat and shrimp we had in our fajitas. Everything was sizzling and delicious.\n\nAnother thing that will keep us coming back for more and more is definitely the margaritas. A 16 oz. margarita that is not at all watered down that tastes SO good is hard to find. I don't even typically like Tequila that much, but this place does it right! \n\nI really really adore the atmosphere and authenticity of the restaurant. They're friendly and serve up a delicious meal. There's no fuss about the place, just delicious food. Just be careful driving in because the roads are crazy!
