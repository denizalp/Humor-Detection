I had to come here, especially since after my scathing review of \"Golden Tiki,\" its owner called me a \"woman who hasn't been laid,\" and told me I was an idiot, and told me I was a paid reviewer paid for by Frankie's Tiki Room. I'm not paid to write anything, although I should be. \n\nRegardless, Frankie's puts Golden Tiki to shame. Here's why:\n\n- The drinks actually taste good, AND they get you totally shitty. I had one drink and was hammered. At Golden Tiki they told me that cocktails are supposed to taste like booze. They're not. That means you suck at making a cocktail.\n- The bartender, Mike, made the drink while quad pouring (!!!) within seconds. At Golden Tiki you wait a long time for your drinks.\n- The bar is dark as hell, which is great. You'd have to be a total weirdo to prefer a well lit bar. Everyone's ugly as hell, why would you want to see them?\n- The music is louder.\n- The decor is cooler. Golden Tiki has Christmas lights on the ceiling, though.\n\nThe only thing I would warn you about is that you will smell like a smoked cigarette when you leave here. \n\nI'll be back, Frankie's!
