I find it funny people are reviewing this mall and saying 1) they can't afford things in it and 2) they didn't like clothes or items they saw in specific stores. Instead, I am going to review it based on what I find important in a mall which is: variety, cleanliness, food options, and ease of navigation. While high end stores such as Louis Vuitton, Tiffany and Co, Nordstrom and Burberry (and more) are here, there are plenty of other options like Express, J. Crew, Victoria's Secret and lots of specialty stores like LL Bean, Godiva, Brookstone and Teavana. I loved when Cheesecake Factory opened, even though the wait for dinner is usually absurdly long. There's a Five Guys in the food court now, as well as a Chik-fil-A... two of my favorites! The mall is extremely clean and beautiful and it is fairly easy to find the store you want. There are two wings with a central food court area that overlooks the lower level. They keep it modern looking and classy, which is a nice change from the run-down 80s look of most malls I've been to. Overall, this is a great mall. I actually enjoy going there to walk around, even if I'm not buying anything!\n\nSomething that irks me: those of the reviewers saying they don't like \"uppity\" people... are they uppity because they are shopping in Louis Vuitton or Nordstrom? As someone who shops at both of those stores, as well as stores like JC Penney, Sears and hell.. even the dollar store, get over yourselves. People like what they like, including you. If they can afford designer things, don't hold it against them.\n\nOne last tip\/ending on a happy note... check out the Nordstrom Cafe... their food is so good! Nice little treat that is tucked away on the top floor of the store! The Nicoise Salad is one of my favorite dishes.
