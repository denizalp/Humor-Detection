Waited almost an hour to sit down and waited. I asked the waiter if the wait would be much longer. The waiter began to yell at me to go somewhere else if I can't wait, \"there's a lot of people and we're busy\". I asked him not to yell and at me & walked away. I told my family, let's go. We've been here many many times before and I can promise you, this was our last.
