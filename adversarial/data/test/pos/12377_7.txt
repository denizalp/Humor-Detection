I HAD SO MUCH FUN! And I meet a new friend that sat across from me. This place is very fun and the teacher is AWESOME!!!  The class was like two hours and its easy to follow directions and if you ever need help or to slow down the teacher does so. She also comes around to check out your work \n\nWhile painting she plays music that is fun to listen to and keeps you happy. When you go in they give you your brushes and a yellow card for a free drink (they give refils like twice-three times) It was funny as I was getting close to being finished the teacher asked if she can see my art work I  said yes, she switched our paintings claiming mine was hers and said how it didn't have inituals so it was hers, shes silly! haha. \n\nThings I liked; Nice relaxing place, nice teacher, they have a pizza bar, free drinks, she actually explains what to do, easy for anyone to do.\n\nThings I think they could work on : I feel that they should try and get pay pal as a meathed of paying them for the classes,it just seems like it would be easier; $45 dollars is a bit expensive for one painting maybe they could lower it a tad or give discounts for locals things of that nature; one more sugestion is they have it set up where if they aren't having a class you can go in for $25 and paint or make what ever you want. I think it would be a cool idea if they had a \"class\" where you could just go in once a month or something and everyone paints what they want. So there would be more then one person, i could see that being very lonly :(. \n\nOver all great fun and I think more people should do it!!! :)
