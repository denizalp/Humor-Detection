I would HIGHLY caution against Westmount Square Medical and their lab partner CDL laboratories. Went there for STD\/HIV test, tested positive for chlamydia... Or so I thought. CDL laboratories called me back over the phone and told me the tests were actually NEGATIVE, to add insult they told me they would have to rerun the HIV test by outsourcing it. At this point I had taken the one dose antibiotic for chlamydia and had already informed other partners who took the medication too due to high risk factor.\n\nWestmount Square Medical then called me to tell me even the HIV test had been botched and fought with me over my request for a refund (I was out $230.00 at this point). They did not return my phone calls, had to leave several nasty voicemails before a supervisor called me back only to play more phone tag. \n\nI still have no idea what happened, no answers have been given yet (almost 3 weeks later), no clue if I'm HIV positive or not and only a partial refund has been rewarded. Had to go to CLSC to be completely retested. No one was overly apologetic (I seemed to be annoying them, they kept passing blame) and my cell phone bill\/work time lost\/embarrassment has been exponential. \n\nDo yourself a favor AVOID THIS NIGHTMARE, avoid Westmount Square Medical and CDL Labs.
