I had been to Lakewood Park prior to now, but I don't think I truly appreciated it until I brought a gaggle of elementary school children this past summer. You figure, a park is a park, right? There isn't THAT much you can really add to a park to make it exciting. Wrong folks. Lakewood Park is all that and a bag of chips. You have dogs? No problem-o. There's a great trail where you can walk your dog. You have a get-together and need a public space? Lakewood Park has got you covered, from a pavilion, to an indoor community space. Your kids are bored with the same old playground equipment at the local park? Impress them by taking them to Lakewood Park, where they have equipment that could only have been tested and approved by kids. (huge points for originality AND durability). In addition, it amazes me that Lakewood Park has a pool AND public seating AND group meeting areas AND an amazing view of the skyline, yet somehow it doesn't feel too claustrophobic or too far-reaching to make it convenient to experience all of it in a couple hours. I cannot recommend this park enough, and I would suggest a visit to anyone who enjoys the outdoors, wants to see a great view of Cleveland, or wants to bring their kids somewhere they can enjoy for free.
