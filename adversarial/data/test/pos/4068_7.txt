I bought a newer car from a dealership and both bumpers needed to be painted because of scratches. The dealership called in a mobile guy from DentPro. The job he did was horrible. The paint didnt match and there were run marks.He didnt clearcoat around the license plate.  I was mortified. After reading reviews i decided to take it to Family Autobody. They gave me a estimate and a week later I brought it in.\n\nI have never been so happy. They colormatched the paint and the metallic perfectly. they did it the right way. You cant even tell that the bumpers were repainted. I couldnt be happier. The staff is so friendly and their waiting room is cozy. ( My husband loved the popcorn machine and candy). I would highly recommend them.
