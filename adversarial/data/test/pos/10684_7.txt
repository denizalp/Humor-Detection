I hate to give such a low rating but I can't lie when i say i really have experienced better. This place almost reminds me off knock off fast food type Greek food. They messed up our to go order(first strike), the staff did not even eat their own food( i asked the opinion of one of the employees and he stated i never have\/will eat this food) whaaaa??? coulda at least lied, would have sounded better geezz..\n\nthe food was just mediocre in my opinion... just a good place for convenience late at night and yes the alcohol is probably a good idea since it probably does in fact help the food taste better. \n\nmeh :\/
