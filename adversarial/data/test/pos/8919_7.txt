Dragon Nails is a bit dirty seeming, but their tools are sterile, and if you're looking for a decent cheap and cheerful manicure on the East Side then look no further. \n\nI love me some Ten Spot and some NailSense, but sometimes a lady just can't afford it. \n\nI got a shellac *mani for $25. What?! That's right $30 for a magnificent mani that lasts, like, 3 weeks including tip. They have just as many shellac colour options as any place in town, and they really take care in applying it. I've heard others complain about polish from this joint chipping too fast. If it isn't shellacked on there, it's gonna come off. Spring for the extra $5, grrrrls (and boy). \n\nWhile I was getting my nails done a lot of people came in to get their eyebrows waxed. I didn't know they did waxing, but they must rock at eyebrows because more people were there for that than to get their nails done.\n\nPEPPER POINTS: For the ladies who work there. They are catty in the best possible way. They also let me choose what channel I want to watch and have full cable. Score.\n\n*Their pedis cost the same, and I believe there is a discount if you do both, but I really hate having my feet touched. I'm very ticklish and I don't like it. Don't even look at my hobbit feet. I will kick you.
