We leased a Beetle here. The older salesman was nice and had a thick European accent. We suspected he might have been a war criminal. We got approved at a very young age with no auto credit, so that was nice. The service department (the catch 22 of leasing- you have to go there) was run by a complete butthole. And we had to go there tons of times, because they kept putting in faulty oxygen sensors. This is ultimately why we didn't buy out the lease. I miss my bug.
