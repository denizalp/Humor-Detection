What makes a weekend get away amazing? Relaxing environment, fun vibrant energy around; a great hotel with good service and finally the area being a nice place to stay that you forget your on vacation. \n\nThis hotel is nice hotel with great service; as long as you don't stay on the Luna side, which is on the opposite end of the lake. The area you walk through to get there will literally drain your energy; but not from it being a half mile walk but because the entire ceiling is filled with cob webs and black looking mold spores. A weekend get away of two nights 3 days cost us $250 from booking.com and your $250 could have been better spent on a nicer better room on the strip. The service of the staff is nice though. Also the lake was only partially dried out, which isn't bad for a drought during summer.\n\nThe bridge of depression you take to the Luna side is bad but not as bad as the village with 75% of the shops empty. Hey even have a casino there that's abandoned. This place hasn't recovered from the crash of the bubble years ago. Hell it looks like this place wasn't even updated since then. The environment and the fun vibe around here is dead along with the glory of this place, but is relaxing since no one is around; like being stranded in the desert searching for your animal guide. \n\nLastly the restaurants here are a bit over priced but being so dead, the three restaurants that were open were pretty expensive for being in the middle of no where. Thankfully the strip is only 40 minutes away to enjoy a nice meal for the same price. \n\nAll in all do not come here there are better ways to throw away money! This place has been neglected and is run down. The lake was mostly dried out so its not a very nature pose to come, I don't even know why it's called lake Las Vegas when this in Henderson, a very desolate and old part of Henderson. Same your money and sleep in the park up the road from here it's cheaper and your closer to amenities!
