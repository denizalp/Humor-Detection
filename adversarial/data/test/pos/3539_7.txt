We had such a great time at this show last night. It was the perfect kick off to a girls weekend in Vegas. I would recommend it to anyone for a bachelorette party, divorce party, birthday, or a regular girls night out. The theater was intimate so there really was not a bad seat. The guys were a lot of fun and everyone in that theater got attention. Such a fun experience!
