Ambiance: located outside the Caesars Palace, and you won't miss it when you see a giant fork, reservation ahead of time is very necessary, considering it's just open last month and so popular, so walk-in is not a very great idea, super spacious inside, forks decorations everywhere, from top high ceiling to table napkin, red and blue colors themed kitchen, fire and ice style \n\nService: servers were friendly and very knowledgeable about their menu and food selections, provided useful information, though a bit slow, especially in the end it took quite a long wait for desserts to come\n\nFood: overall great presentation and delicious taste\n  pan seared scallops - ***** celery root, braised bacon lardons, pickled granny smith apples, so tender and juice, highly recommend \n  pumpkin soup - **** spicy chorizo, creme fraiche, toasted pepitas, creamy and unique flavor, recommend\n  hell's kitchen burger - **** bacon, avocado, fresno pepper jam, crispy onion, ghost pepper jack cheese, seasoned fries, sweet, spicy and rich in flavors, recommend\n  beef wellington - *** potato puree, glazed root vegetables, red wine demi-glace, not as good as expected, was a bit too dry\n  sticky toffee pudding - *** speculoos ice cream, over sweet pudding\n\nPrice: medium portions and premium quality, on average about $65 each
