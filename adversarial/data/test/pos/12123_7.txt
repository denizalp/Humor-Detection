The best non-sleazy hotel value on the strip.\n\nI think people miss the point about the Monte Carlo.  Sure there's no attractions and it's kind of boring.  But, because of that, no one wants to stay there, it's rarely sold out, and they are forced to keep rates low.  It is right in the middle of the action on the strip, and the next step down in hotel is a pretty steep drop off.\n\nThe Monte Carlo is clean, modern, safe, centrally located, and has a decent array of dining options, just like its better-known siblings.  It is more of an adult hotel due to the lack of attractions for kids.  It has no interesting gimmicks like surrounding hotels but that's why you go visit them--you don't have to pay $400+\/night to the Bellagio to enjoy the grounds.  \n\nIf rates are the same, I would pick another more interesting hotel, but the Monte Carlo is usually a better value and the last hotel available before you start getting into casinos that have 60-year-old chain-smoking cocktail waitresses named Trudy waddling around providing visuals you could have done without.
