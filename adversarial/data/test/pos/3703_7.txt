Thanks Yelp for luring me to donuts!  I got a ham and cheese croissant plus 4 donuts (buttermilk, vanilla cake, glazed, and bavarian filled).  The young lady in the front was so sweet and helpful.  All the donuts were so good, light, and fluffy.  The croissant was very good too!  I need to go back to try the boboa drinks.  I can only handle so much sweetness at once!
