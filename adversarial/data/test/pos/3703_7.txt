This bus system is unlike anything that I have ever seen. Not even Miami-Dade buses are this wretched and they have sky high crime. Riding on board feels like the Twilight Zone meets musical chairs in broad daylight. Some bus routes are mobile war zones (e.g. 206 and 105) while others offer a more diverse assortment of M&M's (e.g. would-be murderers, dirty vagrants, substance abusers, people engaging in trash and flash and etc.) for one's riding pleasure. Not even riding the 6 train to the Bronx nor taking the PATH at night was ever this bonkers. Oh yes, here's looking at you, Vegas.    \n\nI am not even going to fully detail RTC's lack of punctuality and disdain for paying passengers such as not informing people of detours. The bus drivers and administrative staff could care less; they are in their air conditioned offices looking important from their cubicles. Las Vegas (including RTC) makes the fallacy to presume that all people who ride the bus are poor trash. That mentality only attracts the same people they deride. Maybe the concept that some bus passengers ride to be green, have the passenger view and chill is too abstract for them to comprehend at this time. \n\nThe markup prices that RTC charges tourists are so not worth the sh.. service that is rendered. If you do decided to board the bus for some odd reason (driving here's dangerous, I know), always purchase your bus passes at an RTC bus terminal. This way, you can obtain the locals price. If you're gonna blow $20 on the Deuce for a few days, why not spend $35 on a residential two week bus pass? When you leave Vegas, you can always pay it forward and give the bus pass to a needy person. There is a lot of poverty in this shiny entertainment mecca. \n\nMy advice for tourists who actually decide to visit Sin City: drive and stay away from most residential neighborhoods. In the span of a decade (maybe longer, if I am right), this town has transformed into an open air zoo. You never know what kind of animals you will encounter be it gorillas, chimpanzees, feral hogs, bison and snakes (constrictors and venomous). \n\nThink of being on the Strip like having a chaperoned date that tells you, \"If you have sex, you die and go to hell.\" The sad truth in this parable is that your conservative chaperone is right and actually means well. Stay in the better part of the Strip indoors or only venture outside to specific locales (e.g. Red Rock, Las Vegas Springs Preserve and Valley of Fire) and you'll tend to be okay if you check your lunar calendar. However, I can't issue any guarantees for anyone's safety in Las Vegas. I hate to sound superstitious, but observe the cycles of the moon and the people, and see what you come up with.  \n\nRiding the cab is at your own risk. This isn't NYC where you can flag a cab and set a negotiable price. From the moment that you hop on in, your life's being billed away. That, and cabbies get into a lot of accidents here over unsafe driving and the results for the parties involved are often fatal.
