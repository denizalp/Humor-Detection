The Deuce is great way to get around Vegas, but like the LV Monorail, it does have a set of positives and negatives.\n\nPositives\n- More stops on the Strip than the Monorail.  There's almost one outside every major resort.\n\n-  $20 for 3 days unlimited rides is a great deal if you want to go up and down the Strip (and you probably will).  One quick note is that not all Ticket Dispensers on the Strip offer the 3-day pass.  I can't name the exact locations, but based off my last trip, I know the machines at The Wynn bus stop offer it.  There's also a stop outside the Fashion Show Mall on Spring Mountain Road in front of Macy's that has a locals rate of $5 for a 24 hour pass, which in actuality is the best deal when you break it down.\n\n-  It also gives you access to venture to Downtown Vegas, and also travel out to the off-strip areas like Summerlin and Chinatown.  This is probably the best perk, especially if you want to eat at a lot of the popular off-strip restaurants like Bachi Burger, Raku, Lotus of Siam, etc.\n\n- Buses are Air Conditioned!!\n\n\nNegatives\n- Traveling by bus on the Strip during peak hours is slow, I mean \"tortoise and the hare\" slow.  You actually benefit more by just walking.\n\n- Missing a bus means you'll have to wait another 15-20 minutes for the next one to arrive.  Sometimes this has let me option for a taxi or walk over the Monorail since their trains arrive more often.\n\nOverall I think the pros still outweigh the cons and whenever I visit Vegas, I always get a 3-day pass immediately when I get there.  Plus it's just nice to ride and take a load off after walking in the hot summer days.
