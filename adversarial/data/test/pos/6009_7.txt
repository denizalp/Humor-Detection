GENERAL NOTES\nI've heard a lot about Katz's over the years but never had the chance to sample until last week. What can I say? I was disappointed. \n\nMENU RECOMMENDATIONS\nSeeing as it's a \"Corned Beef Emporium\" I figured I'd get the corned beef. Wow was it bland and dry. I'll say this about the sandwich - it's big (see pics). I just found the meat itself to be bland. Like Steven Harper bland. At least it doesn't cheer for the Senators. Easily the most disappointing corned beef in Toronto, but surely not the worst. I just have high expectations when it comes to deli meat.\n\nSERVICE NOTES\nI got my sandwich to go and the wait was pretty much the exact amount of time I'd like to wait for a sandwich. Long enough to figure they're making the sandwich properly and fresh but not so long as to annoy me. \n\nLOCATION NOTES\nIf it wasn't for the massive signs you'd surely miss this joint. On the west side of Dufferin at Orfus. Inside it's a cafeteria-style setup. \n\nHUMOUROUS STORY\nI got nothing. That dry, bland piece of shit sandwich zapped all the funny out of me.
