I'd have to say -- off the strip is the way to go!\n\nJust one block off the strip (which in Vegas is a much longer distance, still), you are close to the action but far enough away to enjoy some quiet time if that is what you are looking for.  The Platinum is also a non-casino hotel -- so again quieter, less sad drunks, less problems!\n\nLarge rooms with all the amenities - full kitchen, giant jacuzzi tub, a super posh rain-fall shower, comfortable beds with plenty of pillows, free wi-fi, blow dryer, iron, tv, and a balcony if you bother to upgrade. Really, this room is super well appointed and I was never anything but comfortable and at home here. Plus the ac worked fabulously -- I was never hot when the outside temps were 100 degrees or more!\n\nThe pool area was lovely -- they don't even check your room keys to get in. There is waiter service outside so you can enjoy a pina coloda and nibbles while sunning on one of the many beach beds out there. Towels are provided for you so you don't need to worry about bringing one back to your room, and it is both indoor and outdoors! Despite getting a wee bit pink while sun bathing out there, I really loved the pool area.\n\nRoom service was quick when we called for more towels, tp, and cooking supplies! They tidied our room very well too -- which was something to do since we pretty much had an explosion of clothing in that place.\n\nCheck-in was painfully slow however, and the valet only parking was a bit annoying. Plus their bar\/cocktail lounge was pretty abysmal. I never got to check out the gym or attend the complimentary yoga session since it was closed for a wedding (whose party members were some of the most ANNOYING hotel patrons I have ever come across. Hey random dude who asked me for blow -- really?! Did you ask everyone on the 6th floor for a fix?)\n\nAll in all though, the Plat is a great place to stay -- and totally worth the $77 a night deal we had for Yelp's Spring Break! If\/when I make it back to Vegas I would definitely stay here again.
