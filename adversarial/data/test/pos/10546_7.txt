Located in the heart of Little Italy on Mayfield Road, Corbo's is a fourth generation Italian bakery specializing in cassata cakes, cannolis, tiramisu, lemon ice and other Italian pastries. \n\nOn a recent trip, I had the chocolate cannoli. The tube shaped fried pastry was perfectly crisp. The ends dipped in chocolate & upon ordering, filled with a fresh, sweet, creamy ricotta cheese mixture. The divine combination sent my pallet on a wild journey through flavortown. Madone!
