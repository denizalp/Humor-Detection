i do love blossom.  i don't go to the big shows very often anymore, but if i have my choice, i much prefer the blossom experience.\n\nin the summers, you can bring your hunnybunches of oats, sit on the lawn, and listen to the orchestra play romantic interludes as you feed 'em cheese with his wine.\n\nyou can bring a big ol' blanket and rock out to a hair band of yesteryear with all your friends, laughing at the irony of acid washed jeans and the big open spaces echoing pour some sugar on me.  \n\nor, if you're lucky, you can sit in the pavilion and enjoy any, all, or something else.\n\ni recently headed back to blossom this week to catch the radiohead show.  i really love this space.  we didn't have to deal with all the walking and parking miles away since we had the vip passes (awww snap is right) but even if we had, i wouldn't have been complaining. \n\nthe set up of blossom is great.  surrounded by trees, strategically placed bars, booths, and merch stands, and enough space for a bunch of people.  i mean, even with a sold out crowd at the radiohead show, i was still impressed with the joint.  great acoustics.  \n\nit's your summer cleveland concert experience.\n\nlove.this.place.\n\nactually, my first concert ever was here.  back when i was eight.  lawn seats.  the beach boys with the 'rents\n\nhell yeah.
