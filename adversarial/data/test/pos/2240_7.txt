Fune is like visiting a familiar and comfy old home. Err - or maybe that's just on account of my being here at least 1-3 times per week for lunch.  I love watching the hypnotizing miniature wooden boats float by on the \"sushi-go-round\" moat.  It somehow makes it a lot less awkward in dining alone, like staring at a TV screen with only one channel\/the fireplace channel. Aww yeaaaah, I would totally subscribe to that one. \n\nThe sushi quality is a bit higher than AYCE.  Here, the glistening slabs of fish are cut a little thicker, the sashimi is served atop a shiso leaf, and pieces aren't like a car tire of rice the way AYCE places roll them out (pun intended, oh thilly, thilly Rando). But a certain other sushi joint close by has ruined all other sushi joints in Toronto for me, and I now expect no less than to be given a piece-by-piece served straight from the chef's cutting board to a plate in front of me.  I mean, all the sushi sitting on one singular plate at once? What am I, a peasant?! Pfft. \n\nBratty kidding aside, the pricing here is reasonable for the area. For example, an order of ika sashimi is $10 as opposed to a much stingier portion for about $15 at a neighbouring sushi place. I recommend to skip the greasy, heavy-battered tempura and try the nabeyaki udon instead. Broth sweetened by the nappa cabbage, my tip is to eat the scallop before it turns rubbery...
