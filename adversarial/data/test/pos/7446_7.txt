I am a regular, (in fact I am the four square Mayor :-)  at this Starbucks - so why do I give a 1? In general the service is average but yesterday I went there and their debit and credit machine was not working which is a regular occurrence, they informed me of this after I made my order, I said I did not have cash but would be happy to stop back latter to pay, (any other Starbucks would have comped the latte in an instant) they said sorry and looked at me like I had a hole in my head, (also of note to add some color I had just walk their from my house and had baby Harper strapped to the front of me). So this morning my wife does the Starbucks run, she straps on Baby Harper and walks the five blocks, (up Hill both ways) to Starbucks, as she is leaving I tell her to be sure to take cash. She gets to Starbucks makes her order, they tell here that the Debit and Credit is not working, she says fine and hands them cash, they then say \"we don't take cash over $20 bills! She just ordered two coffees which cost about $10 and they won't  take larger than $20? Again the staff look at her like she is the one who does not get how the  world works.
