Disclaimer: this was my first exposure to Korean food. If I could recommend some more expert reviews to read on this, i would say check out Dan C, Ellen O, Peggy C and Christi K's posts. \n\nI have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Dan C. took myself and some friends here on Monday night. We put him in charge of recommendations and ordering. We got a round of appetizers for our group of five and all different entrees. I don't know what anything is called... so bear with me. App wise kimchi pancake, steamed bun and the wonton-potsticker like goodness. I went with the bbq pork with steamed rice. \n\nBottom line: it was all good. The seafood noodle type soup was LOADED with seafood. And best part... it's all a ton of food. We all had leftovers for the next day. Split 5 ways we each spent only $16. What a deal.\n\nSome things to know (for those not familiar with PePeRo or Korean cuisine)\n\n-There's a bell at your table for service.\n\n-Try all the sides that come out with your food.\n\n-If you're coming from Charlotte on Monroe Rd, turn before the restaurant. I drove past it and turned into the driveway on the other side which is actually for another business.\n\n-Go explore the grocery store. \n\n-Both the store and the restaurant take credit cards. However, please note the grocery store does have a $20 minimum.\n\n-They do have plastic forks for the chopstick-challenged. And by chopstick challenged, I am talking about myself. This is the girl who eats sushi with her hands.\n\n-Don't be afraid to ask questions. Someone can point you in the right direction.\n\nI will definitely be back. I loved the vibe here. It was comforting and kind of felt like getting a homecooked meal at a relative's house.
