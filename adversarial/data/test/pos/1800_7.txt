SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STINKIN DELICIOUS!!!!!\n\nWe ordered a fried shrimp po boy, order of catfish, chicken tenders, and kids burger.\n\nAll the food here is simply amazing! The catfish here is FAT. They give Mario's a run for their money for sure! The breading is perfect and it's cooked really well! \n\nThe po boy is seriously the best one I've had, EVER. The shrimp were HUGE! The breading was perfect, they were juicy and the sandwich itself is large! The side of fries were also delicious and not all soggy and funky. The chicken tenders were soooo juicy and tender and not overly breaded and HUGE as well! Would def purchase them again! The stand out of this meal was the coleslaw! It's a mayo base and I swear I could just eat it all day!\n\nThey also serve a franks red hot sauce (idk if its the real franks) hot sauce, not this Louisiana hot sauce crap! The real deal!\n\nFood is simply delicious and we will be going back for sure!\n\nYay!
