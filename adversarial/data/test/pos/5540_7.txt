I was craving gnocchi and came here with a friend. They had a lovely menu that offered a variety of options for both of us. \n\nWe were seated right away in a quiet spot. It was pouring rain and we were happy to have a place to seek shelter from the storm. I ordered a lavender lemonade and my friend had a glass of wine. The lavender lemonade came with red puree. When I asked the server why it was red, he simply responded that was the puree they used. There were hints of lavender but the lemonade was overpowering and definitely the star of the show. The server also brought 3 pieces of bread (for 2 of us) and some butter. We had to fight over that last piece. :-(\n\nThe ricotta gnocchi comes with braised beef short ribs, wild mushrooms, spinach, and gorgonzola cream sauce. The beef short ribs were cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was tender and fell apart when I touched it with my fork. The wild mushrooms were a nice blend and offered good balance to the dish. The cream sauce wasn't too strong and the spinach offered a bit of color and different flavor. The gnocchi was the most disappointing part of this dish. Ricotta is often added to gnocchi to lighten them up. I'm accustomed to gnocchi that are light, scored on the sides with a fork, and melt in your mouth. These were heavy, dense, doughy rocks. \n\nMy friend and I shared an order of beignets. It was a large portion for $7 and a good value. However, these were not beignets. I would describe them as drop donuts. They were in approximate circular-ish shapes. After being fried, they were covered in cinnamon and sugar. Powdered sugar was only sparingly sprinkled on the top few donuts. They came with a caramel, chocolate, and berry coulis sauce.\n\nMy friend had the salmon burger and it tasted good. Her portion of fries was rather large but they were seasoned well, warm, and an overall good side dish. \n\nThe space is very warm and inviting. During warmer months, there's plenty of opportunities to sit outside. It looks like a great gathering place for groups. The food leaves a bit to be desired.
