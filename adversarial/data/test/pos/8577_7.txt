This is a really nice gym!\nI won a free 30 day membership at a fundraiser for my friend's nephew, so I decided to check it out with fellow Yelper, Dan S and his wife, Kristin S. \nLocated on the south end of Crocker Park, LA Fitness consists of three floors.  The first floor has the cafe\/smoothie bar, locker rooms, sauna, and a lap pool.  The second floor is the main workout area with cardio equipment, a cardio theater, weight machines, free weights, a group fitness room, a spin class room, and a personal training area. The third floor has a indoor track along with more cardio equipment.\n\nThe layout is pretty nice, with plenty of windows for natural light which makes for a very modern and clean place to work on your fitness.   The locker rooms are clean and spacious, although reeking of B.O. at times. Lockers are plentiful and the paper towel dispensers stay stocked, which is definitely an issue at the other gym I frequent.\n\nThe equipment on the gym floor seems to be clean and well maintained...I have yet to experience any issues.  The free weight area is nice, but I wish it were a little bigger.\nThe one group exercise class I did take was pretty tough, but the instructor was great!  The room is a good size, well lit, and with good ventilation as well. I was sore all over for days after that class!\n\nThe track on the 3rd floor is nice, and is usually pretty empty when I go after work. \n\nThis is a pretty popular gym, yet it doesn't seem to be too crowded whenever I go! I love that!
