\"I vote steak for dinner\" I say to three fellow poker buds.\n \n\"Cow, I'm down\" says one.\n\n\"Mooooooo\" says Midwest poker bud.\n\n\"Uh guys, I became a vegetarian a month ago\" says SoCal poker dude.\n\n\"Oh cool, if my dog gets sick, I'll call you.  Steak it is\", Midwest poker dude with a laugh.  And we're off (Not that we don't care but Vegetarian for a month?  Cheat Day!)\n\nFrom the pedigree that brought us Morton's Steakhouse comes MB Steak.  The brothers, self proclaimed pioneers of the next \"classic\" steakhouse,  and why not, N9NE at the Palms is one of their ventures.  So?\n\nA contemporary steakhouse with a true Vegas vibe whose food is clearly centered around millennial's, all the right hot ingredients seasoned and prepared just a touch different to make them seem apart from daddy's steakhouse.  Jokes on them, as the old becomes retro chic.  Sauces, crusts, and the heavy herb seasoning's of the 1970s are back.\n\nStarters include an excellent charred Spanish octopus. Tender chunks of grilled octopus atop a stewed tomato port wine reduction.  Sweet, acidic, bitter all work to bring out the oceanic flavor..  The foie, solid.  Seared, its fat dripping over a gently sweeten brioche French toast and soaking into macerated strawberries. A Sherry reduction adds the classic nuttiness that rounds out the dish.  The \"bacon and eggs\" thick cut grilled maple bacon, its dripping fat, a pile of fris√©e, topped off by a soft poached egg. Break the egg, mix it all up, a rich, satisfying warm salad.\n\nThe main attractions, the steaks. Offered both wet and dry aged USDA prime, or American, Australian, and Japanese wagyu.  This being a first try, we stuck to the American classics.  In general, the steaks are well trimmed, relatively evenly cooked with a good sear.  One level over temp through the center though the steaks maintained their tenderness and juiciness.  Seasoning is aggressive and peppery.  It works for the thick Tomahawk, flavoring it to its core and complimenting the gentle dry aged funk.  The dry aging is not overpowering.  In comparison, the porterhouse showcases classic American beef flavor.\n\nNote:  will update this review after sampling the signature bone in short rib.\n\nStandard steakhouse sides. Solid Yukon mash, very good maitakes that went well with the dry aged tomahawk.  The standout, the lobster mac & cheese.  Though slightly overcooked, a pile of lobster tail meat atop a very rich mac & cheese.  Heaven.  It works well with the beef, enhancing its natural sweetness.\n\nCorrect service but the performance still needs work, opening jitters that should go away with time.\n\nGood wine list.  Typical Vegas resort markup.\n\nA worthy upper mid tier steakhouse.  Solid but IMHO does not break into the Vegas top five.
