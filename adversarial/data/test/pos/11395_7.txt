The Hush Puppy is a pretty neat little gem. We had our pup with us, visiting the area, and since there is no outdoor dining area, we opted to take the drive through. Note - the dine in menu offers more variety than the drive through menu offerings.\n\nOrdering was fast and easy and prices are quite reasonable for the quailty of the food. We ordered the fried green tomatoes, alligator tail, hushpuppies, sweet tea, pecan pie, collard greens and the #8 (catfish fillets, shrimp and fries). Everything was great and my husband who grew up in the South (Georgia\/Alabama) said that the fried catfish in particular was spot on and VERY GOOD! The collards greens were also perhaps the best ones we have ever had and the fried shrimp were equally as great.\n\nIf you're in the area and looking for a good fill of Southern fried catfish and other \"Southern\" hints of food, we certainly recommend giving the Hush Puppy a try.
