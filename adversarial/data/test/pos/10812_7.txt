My wife and I stayed at the Hard Rock this past weekend because they were cheap. We reserved the room on Travelocity but the problems started as soon as we rolled up at the Valet. I own a limousine business (LA LimoScene if you wanna look me up.) and we drove to Vegas in a Limo with a friend. We tried to valet the Limo and they first told me I needed to go over to the South Valet on Harmon and they could valet the Limo over there so I drove around to the South Valet and they also refused, accusing me of being some guy that tried this last week. I told them I wasn't that guy but they still gave me attitude. I asked them for oversized parking and they told me to park in self park. I drove up to the self park area and there were NO spaces big enough to accomodate the Limo so I had to park in a non-space at the end of the parking structure. I wasn't blocking anyone so I figured it would be okay. When I came out at the end of my stay, I had a parking citation on my car for parking in a non-space. I was pissed since I asked and they sent me to park there.\n\nThen, once we got inside, the girl at the Reservation Desk couldn't find our Reservation. We were in a hurry to check in because we had tickets to a concert so the added time it took for her to figure out where our reservation was didn't help. It took about 20 minutes to check in. Once she found it and we got up to our room, it took them another half hour to get our bags up to our room from the valet.\n\nThe room was fairly nice. The bed was really comfortable and the black out curtains would have made it possible for us to sleep in had it not been for the planes flying over and landing every 20 minutes. HRH proximity to the airport is a definite downside. The bathtub was really high so when you get in and out of the bathtub, you trip over the edge and either fall in or out of the bathtub, depending on which direction you're going.\n\nThe prices were ridiculous throughout the hotel. It was like renting a room at the airport. $10.50 for a pack of cigarettes.\n\nChecking out was equally poor. We couldn't get the Bel desk to answer the phone so we had to go down to the front desk to request someone to go up and get our bags. When we finally got them, several things were missing including my Gucci Sunglasses and that $10.50 pack of cigarettes.\n\nWhen we got home and checked our statement, we found that they had charged $400 to our card even though we prepaid for the room and then credited back $166. When we called to find out what happened, they were rude and said the charges were $15 per person for a resort fee and then hung up on us.\n\nAll in all, the Hard Rock sucks. I definitely do not recommend them.
