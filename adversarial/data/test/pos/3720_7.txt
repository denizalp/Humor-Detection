I find myself unusually nervous about reviewing Sokolowski's University Inn.  It just seems to be so venerated and beloved by so many.  But I'll be honest as my experience wasn't the best.  My husband and I visited recently on a cross country trip and we were excited to try a Polish restaurant while in Cleveland.  We did read some reviews beforehand, so we understood it was cafeteria style and there might be a long line and other minor eccentricities.  No problem, we thought.  When we arrived, there was no line at all, but we were confused by the dessert section coming first, so we attempted to enter from the other direction and were met by a confused and somewhat angry dishwasher who had difficulty communicating to us that we were heading in the wrong direction.  While that was certainly not his fault, it was disconcerting as a first impression.  We went back the original way and fell into line with our trays.  \n\nThe food items were not marked and there was no posted menu.  There were a few sheets of copy paper taped in various sections, either printed out from a Word program or written on with pen, to indicate pricing and menu items available.  My husband was most excited to try the scrod and they told us they hadn't had it in months.  By that time, there was a line forming and we made some quick picks and had to ask what everything was, so we tried to just go with whatever looked good.  We got kielbasa, chicken paprikash, pierogies, and green beans.  Overall, the taste was okay but not mind blowing.  My chicken seemed undercooked (pink center I could not eat), which was the worst offense here, but it was too busy by then to make any changes and to be honest I felt a little intimidated.  The sauce was good, at least.  \n\nWhen I used the ladies restroom, an employee of Sokolowski's was on her way out and she screamed that I'd scared her.  I apologized twice and she kept repeating \"you scared me\" very angrily.  It was crazy, especially from an employee who was coming out as I was about to enter? I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome here. \n\nWe were shocked to find that these authentic pierogies tasted, to both of us anyway, exactly like Mrs. T's from the supermarket freezer.  I'm sure they are far better quality but I expected to taste a marked difference.  Also, the green beans were 2\/3 bright green and 1\/3 brown. I don't even know what else to say.  Two stars for my experience here, and hoping it was just an off day all around for this restaurant.
