Previous experiences with TGI Fridays were so blah that I have not come back in five years. My friends and I nicknamed TGIF as \"That Glop is Food?\". And then I remembered this place has karaoke.  I didn't want to hear some drunk dude screaming \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\".  Well, not when I didn't have an ear infection or wasn't drunk. But my nephew decided, \"TGI Fridays!\" as we pondered the restaurant choices at Aliante Casino. And no karaoke that night! \n\nWe got seated right away. This new beautiful casino has several new restaurants. This TGIF is one of the best looking in their chain.  It's got some dark woods and bright colors inside. It was super clean with less than half the tables filled. The bar is a very classy looking place, and the bartenders were energetic as they heard tales from gamblers who just lost their shirts. We gave our drink orders and our waitress came back quickly with our drinks and took our food order.\n\nI chose the Mac and Cheese with grilled chicken breast. My nephew had the full rack of ribs. My brother had the pork chop with mashed potatoes. Our food came out in about 20 minutes. My dish was excellent. Al dente pasta was tossed with light creamy white cheeses, and topped with grated cheese.  There was a smallish grilled chicken breast. It was a winner and a great deal for $6.00. It was easily the best value on the menu. The pork chop ($13) was nicely  grilled with a creamy side of mashed potatoes.  It was small portion-wise that I wished had two pork chops even at a slightly higher price. My nephew's full rack of ribs ($16) came with crispy fries, not  greasy at all.   The cole slaw taste-wise was flat as a a bad karaoke singer's pitch. But overall, each one of us gave this place a thumbs up.\n\nSince we have a lively time whenever we're together, the waitress was around to check on us, but not intrusive. She was prompt with refills. clearing off plates, bringing the check and running it through the machine.  We had a very nice time.  This time I could honestly say \"TGIF -Thank God It was Fine\".
