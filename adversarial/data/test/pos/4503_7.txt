The cinnamon rolls are just as good as I remember from my last visit to another location. It's hard to believe these sweet treats are vegan. Vegan is a four letter word to my husband and he raved over the cinnamon rolls and cookie dough. \n\nThere are so many possibilities for how many customized rolls can be made from all of the frostings and toppings. For those that get overwhelmed by too many options there are also suggested creations in the display. \n\nI created my own roll with amaretto frosting, caramel sauce, and pie crumble. My roll was amazing. The texture and taste of the roll was perfection. The frosting and sauce were delicious. The pie crumble topping was a brown sugar oat kind of topping and it worked so well with the roll. My husband went with a Birthday Cake roll which also had an amazing flavor. \n\nTo enjoy later we both ordered a Cookie Dough as well. My S'more Cookie Dough was amazing, buttery and full of flavor. It tasted just like the real thing. My husband's Cookies-N-Cream Cookie Dough was also delicious.\n\nOur orders didn't take too long to prepare. Fresh batches of rolls are made regularly so sometimes it can take a minute. It's totally worth it for the hot from the oven roll. Pricing is reasonable for the portions and amazing quality.
