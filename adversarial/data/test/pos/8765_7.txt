Great Gluten-Free Pizza and Dessert Menu!\n\nPicazzo's is the only true pizza resturant I've found in the valley (and Sedona and Flagstaff for that matter) that has a full Gluten-Free menu including drinks and desserts. It's nice to be able to go out to dinner with friends and have a whole gf menu ready for me so I don't have to feel like the weird kid out. \n\nIt's a bit expensive for the gf pizza...somthing like $18 when I get all the goodies on top, but to me it's worth it and the pizza itself is fabulous. I usually get the veggie pizza and then toss some pepperoni or sausage on it to spice it up a bit. The medium is a good size for 2 people and will leave 1 person enough to take leftovers home.
