There's no other word to describe this place other than \"elegant\". Sheer elegance. With the almighty Sinatra's awards displayed for all patrons to see, golden curtains draping across the windows to the beautifully lit outdoor patio, and a cozy, intimate feel in the dining room, there's no wonder Encore guests deem this to be one of the most alluring restaurants to dine at.\n\nSwoon to Frank's biggest hits as you sip on a glass of wine or one of their specialty cocktails. The bellini was peachy sweet and smooth. A bit heavy on the peach puree, but just the right amount of bubbly. Everything about this venue is classy, including the menus. A soft glossy binder with a very simple selection of pastas, meat, and seafood - I've never admired such immense detail in a restaurant.\n\nBeing forewarned by previous diners, I decided to split an order of the chicken parmigiana and a side of penne pasta with my gal pal. Originally, the side was supposed to be spaghetti, but I asked our waiter if we could substitute it to any other pasta and penne was on the list. \n\nThe chicken was superb! Moist and tender, but not overly drenched in tomato sauce. The mozzarella was baked to a browned ooey gooey perfection and just melted in my mouth. I tried a taste of my friend's chicken saltimbocca (prosciutto wrapped chicken breast w\/ asiago & sage) which was rich in flavor, but the prosciutto was overcooked and didn't melt onto the chicken. The capesante (seared Maine diver scallops) was my favorite dish of the evening. 4 plump scallops crispy on the outside, firm and chewy on the inside. The chef did a wonderful job searing each piece perfectly. \n\nThe only factor that caused Sinatra to fall short of a 5-star review was that the prices were waaay overpriced for what you're getting. But I suppose it's true when they say you're paying for the ambiance. For Italian influenced cuisine, I don't believe 2 slices of chicken parmigiana should cost $30...no matter how delicious they were. \n\nRegardless, I'd come back. I'll just have to work extra hard at the tables before walking through the front door though.
