Not authentic in the least. \nVery disappointed in the quality of the food. They dont offer a lot of the basics I'm used to back in Michigan: meat options, mixing meats with combos. Not to mention they offer hard tacos. The enchiladas were just okay. The beans were definitely from a can and the rice tastes more Chinese than Mexican.\n\nThe wait isn't worth it unless you don't know Mexican food.\n\nYep, this gringa is saying this isn't authentic Mexican food.\nI should've run when I saw cheddar on everything (not Oaxaca), chicken nuggets for kids, and they offer flour tortillas.
