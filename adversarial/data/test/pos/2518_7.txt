Summary\nHashtag The Rave was better. \n\nIt has been two years -- (time flies) -- and this theatre has gotten drastically worse in those two years. AMC: Making everything worse, since incorporation. I love that. \n\nThey don't give a damn about this location -- or any location -- because people keep buying tickets and watching moving pictures at their theatres. \n\nBy the way: they maintain prices as if they were a premium theatre. Tourist trap. \"I've experienced better.\"
