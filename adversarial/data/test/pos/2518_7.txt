Monday night! Where do I start! My husband and I wanted to sit down and enjoy a nice meal! We walk up to the front desk and we're seated immediately. We get to the table and I ask the hostess where the restroom was located. They don't have one in the restaurant so my husband walked with me to the nearest restroom. We returned to find our table has been given away. I immediately asked for the manager. Amber Crain rudely says \"I am the manager\" I asked her why they gave away our table when we clearly told them we would be back and we were going to the restroom. She began to give me attitude so I asked for her GM and her name. She picked up the phone and just as I though she was calling her GM she actually called security and embarrassed  me and my husband (I can only hope this would happen to a Caucasian patron). All of this was unnecessary! As a Manger she should have apologized and offered us a solution. Maybe a new table. Anything besides attitude and embarrassment. The security officers were very nice and understood my frustration. They told me Amber is pregnant and probably hormonal. As a server at an upscale restaurant who had been in the industry for 15 years and I have had 3 children while being a server. My professionalism would never allow me to treat a guest like that and if I did my managers would not tolerate it at all! We care about our guests experiences where I work (no matter what race or gender.) Amber either needs a reality check, new profession, or to go on maternity leave if she can't control herself. \n\nI hope management does the right this here and I pray this never happens to anyone else. After I left I had an amazing Dinner and overall experience at Giada's best $300 I spent. I am happy Amber drove me away to have a great dinner with my husband and put money I  someone else's pocket. Good Job Amber! You ma'am are doing your restaurant such a great service. Also after Amber refused to give me her name. One of the waiters went to my husband and gave us her name. Thanks to you  I was able to expose her for what she did to us! Oh and thanks for smirking at me when security was speaking to me. Complete lack of professionalism.
