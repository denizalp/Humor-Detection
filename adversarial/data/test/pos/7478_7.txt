Always such an amazing experience every time my daughter and I come. We didn't have an appointment today and they were able to get us both in right away. Good thing we came right when they opened because they filled up very quickly. My daughter got her usual coffin nails and I did the mani pedi combo, but upgraded to get the organic coconut pedicure which includes  Coconut Sugar Scrub, Coconut mask, Coconut lotion, Coconut massage oil, Callus treatment, CND cucumber heel treatment, 10 minute hot stone massage w\/botanical dip skin candle oil lotion. It felt so amazing, and the best part is they just lowered the price to $37. I'm not to into acrylics and typically get a basic manicure which is only $15. Service is always wonderful, very friendly, clean, and detail oriented. They do not rush and my nails always come out so beautiful.
