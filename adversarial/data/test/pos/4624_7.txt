We came in 15 minutes before the restaurant closed and they treated us like royalty. My wife ordered a small salad to start and it was huge. My pizza came and they nailed it. The crust was crisp. The sauce was just right. They were generous with the cheese. Good music. We sat outside. I left stuffed and happy.
