I read...Voraciously. Five books a week\/reread favorites always have a book or four in my car read. My name is Christie O. and I can't stop reading. But, I don't read from Nooks or Kindles: I read books. This is my local library and I can be found here weekly (at least) picking out, sniffing (yes, I sniff them, too) and ordering wait listed or choices from other locations. \n\nAside from being the most beautiful person I know, Mom instilled a love of books and libraries at a very young age and is reason #9,996574363 why she is the best.person.ever. Story time at the NYC Library (where Carrie & Big's ill fated wedding was to be in SATC) is a magical childhood memory. \n\nThis particular library also houses NV Ballet Co HQ and although small in comparison to say W Sahara branch as far as Art Collection, is not at all shabby in that department. The Librarians and workers are so kind and knowledgeable, even suggesting titles to us. At various times, orgs I've worked with have been generously allowed to use some of the display cases in the exhibit area to illustrate history, awareness etc of a cause\/mission. \n\nNBT puts on some great productions here and there are also some great, very reasonably priced Community Theatre Productions, too. The study rooms are very conducive to just that: quiet pursuit of knowledge. \n\nSo thankful for the impressive Library system here, and enjoy getting my sniffing\/reading fix as often as I can. \n\nOnly a few scenarios trump this in my mind: the aforementioned NYC library; a Belle\/Beauty and the Beast style library of my own; my beloved Telegraph Ave Berkeley used book haunts...and pristine first editions of all the classics. \n\nTill any of the above comes to pass, I'll continue reading, sniffing and loving every minute of it!
