I hate this place. It's just completely crappy Mexican food and everything I despise about the preponderance of people who honestly think they know how to run a restaurant and make authentic cuisine. It's uninspired, bland, and perfect for anyone from out of town who thinks Taco Bell is indigenous. Please. Go elsewhere. It's also dingy, the waitstaff is bored, and the margaritas are weak.
