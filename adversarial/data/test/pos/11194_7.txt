This is my first time in the office with my kids.  The staff was very polite, nice, and reassuring about what they were about to do.  They explained everything that was needed for my treatment and made sure I understood everything.  The waiting room was not crowded like my previous office.  Definitely a joy to come and less nerve wrecking.
