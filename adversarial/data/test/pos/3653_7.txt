Like kaiseki cuisine which originates from Kyoto, at Neo Coffee Bar there is an emphasis on quality over quantity and meticulous attention to detail and seasonality posing as deceptive simplicity.  Sometimes I wonder if our taste buds have been run over by the syrupy sweet concoctions at Starbucks or Tim Horton's where we are handicapped to appreciate the inherent taste of natural ingredients buried under an avalanche of sugar, butter, and cream and when one comes across a well crafted product, it is dismissed as being bland or lacking flavor.\n\nSingle origin coffee beans, imported matcha from Kyoto, organic milk, free range eggs, the owners take great pride in crafting excellent beverages and baked goods in a serene environment and fostering conversation on the weekends by being laptop\/tablet free from 12-4pm.\n\nDrinks are not too sweet in order to highlight the natural flavors of the well-sourced ingredients as are the desserts which rotate on a seasonal basis depending on the freshest fruits available.   Their cake rolls are probably the most popular but the exceptional standout for me are their muffins, which combine the two best elements with a crispy caramelized exterior countervailed with a moist feathery interior allowing the fruits to have a distinct note of freshness with each bite.  Gourmet cakes and pies may get all the attention in the baking world, but there's something to be said in crafting a world class muffin.\n\nA welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the urban lifestyle in the St. Lawrence neighborhood offering a snapshot of Kyoto in terms of food, drink, community, and aesthetic.
