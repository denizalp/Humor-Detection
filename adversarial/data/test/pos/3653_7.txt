My wife wanted something done and we got a recommendation from friends about Modena laser center.  As always I think my wife is beautiful as she is but some times she dose not believe me.  So she got some Botox done and it was administerd by a board certified doctor.  I was impressed with the work and was really happy it was done by a real doctor, not some nurse or assistant.  When I think of a professional thoughtful clinic to get beauty enhancements done for my wife, it will be Modena Laser Center
