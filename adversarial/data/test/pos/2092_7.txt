Everything that is wrong with chain restaurants. First clue: robotically cheerful drones wearing baseball hats and headsets to greet you. Next: table buried under menus, special offer flyers, rewards card app, etc.  Then: food choices. I have nothing against red meat. Love burgers. But if you want to know why America has become the most obese country look no further. Unlimited fries with every sandwich? Really?  Bottomless rootbeer float. Oink oink. There is enough sodium in this food to melt the January ice on Lake Monona.
