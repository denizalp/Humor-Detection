This is my second favorite place in Streetsville for a shawarma.  My major complaint here is that the guy has no menu available, and when you ask him what he has he just says \"shawarma\" as if thats all they sell.  If you ask for rice, he does have it in the back.  If you ask for falafel, he will make it.  So why does he only try to sell shawarma and nothing else?  I just don't get it..  It's more like walking into somebody's living room rather than a shawarma place because there's no menus and no mentions of food anywhere!  Very confusing choice by the guy here, I don't get that at all..  \n\nbut aside from that, the shawarma is very tasty and I have always enjoyed my food from here.  Go liberal on the hot sauce because it's pretty mild, and there's always bottles available for every table which is nice as well for sauce-a-holics\n\nVery affordable, but beware the hours, seems to always be closed as soon as it gets dark out, definitely the shortest hours of all 5 shawarma places in Streetsville
