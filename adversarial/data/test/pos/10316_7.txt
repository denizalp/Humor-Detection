One word to describe my dinner experience here is...\n\nMeh.\n\nIt was nothing worth repeating a visit. Nothing blew me away and nothing was nasty or anything like that, but nothing was memorable either.\n\nI'm often baffled when I discover American cuisine restaurants have added \"Asian Inspired\" items to their menu. I had the wonton shrimps accompanied with chow mein. The wonton shrimps were pretty good, but the chow mein was not-so-good. \n\nCasey's I suggest you do some research. Try a couple mom and pop Chinese restaurants or go to a mall food court to consume some Manchu Wok. Yes, Manchu Wok's chow mein is nothing close to the chow mein served at authentic Chinese restaurants. But news flash Caseys: you don't serve either version of chow mein. And for that, I think you should NOT call yours chow mein. Ya hear me!\n\nAs for dessert, I don't consider store bought cakes and calling it your own considered quality dessert unless you're bringing it to a potluck. Ladies and gents I know it sounds good, but take my advice when I say pass on the mini peanut butter brownie sundae.
