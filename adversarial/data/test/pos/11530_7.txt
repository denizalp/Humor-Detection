My expectations for this place wasn't so high but it was so good compared what I thought it would be. The place itself is really cute looking. Parking lot shared with other business' next to it. It's huge inside and really clean! I tried the Cuban and the clam chowder. I haven't had chowder that good since I was in San Diego! The Cuban is so good. That was the first time I've ever had a cuban sandwich and it was amazing. I feel like the pickles made it a little weird, but in a good way. When we walked in, everyone was so busy but the line died down so quickly. It's so weird because as soon as someone walked in, 7 more would follow out of no where! So don't let the lines scare you off, because within 2 minutes you'll be in the front! Their chocolate covered strawberries are amazing too! Can't wait to come back here.
