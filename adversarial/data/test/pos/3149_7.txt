Been using this company for OVER a year. They finally ruined my opinion of them by using the \"bait and switch\" technique that so many carpet cleaning businesses are infamous for. Charged me an extra fee for something which they have always included as part of the service (steaming the area rug in my one bedroom apartment). The technicians flat out said they don't clean rugs, when I called Brent to find out what on earth was happening he claimed they \"never do it without an extra charge and noting in on the paperwork.\" Well that is funny, seeing as how they have always done it with the regular carpet cleaning without any extra charge or issue, and why is it my problem that they haven't included it in the paperwork? How on earth would I be privy to what should and should not be included? Brent said it always has to be noted in their service and it has never been noted in mine... At this point he was basically implying that I was lying about the fact that they have always included cleaning the rug at no extra fee, when in truth I was completely unaware of this \"policy\". \n\nIdk what the guy wanted me to say, every team has ALWAYS cleaned it, without question, so this entire time I have been under the impression that it was simply part of their service (which was great up until the last two visits where things have really gone downhill.) This is an example of yet another company trying to make an extra buck by surprising their clients with new charges that simply did not exist before, at least not to the client's knowledge. Surprise! \n\nUnfortunate, because I have been a client for so long and everything started off so well. Brent wasn't even the least bit concerned over my situation or surprised by it, instead he told me it would be $10 dollars. That is where the customer service started and ended, not even a canned apology or \"our mistake,\" just an attitude of \"it is what it is, get over it and pay us.\" Thanks guys, really fantastic service you're doing.
