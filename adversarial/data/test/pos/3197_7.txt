I must be the real oddball here, cause I don't find Kensington Market so amazing.  Can I blame it on me going on a Saturday instead of a Sunday?  Or maybe I am too old, so I vividly remember how the Toronto Chinatown looked like in the early 90's, or how the San Francisco street market looked like in the 80's.  Well, Kensington brings back old memories for me for sure.  There is nothing hip for me here, other than vivid resembling of San Francisco and east LA in the 80's, being hippies or yuppies as you wish to describe it.  The streets are dirty just like Toronto Chinatown in the early 90's (kid you not).   The City can really do some asphalt resurfacing here as well.\n\nThere is a concentration of Mexican food eateries\/restaurants here, which are why I trolled Kensington Market one Saturday.  They are basically pubs that serve Mexican foods.  The key word here is pub first and Mexican later.\n\nKensington Market is over-hyped; it has to be a poster child of certain spin doctors.  I can see that the only way I can comprehend the charm of Kensington Market is to play a local tourist, and to walk down the memory lanes.  At least there is a green P parking nearby, and beer is everywhere for one to buy.
