If I had more money, I would probably spend most of it on Merchant. I love Merchant. Merchant reminds me of those higher-scale Chicago craft-cocktail bars, so if you've ever been to one of those (think Violet Hour, Big Star, Small Bar, etc.), give Merchant a try.\n\nPrices make this a once-in-a-while, special-treat kind of place for me, but the drinks are some of the best on the Square, the atmosphere is relaxed but still cool, and the food is delicious. Although, full disclosure, anywhere that serves aioli with their fries is already at least a solid B+ in my book. (Another plus: I have yet to see a bartender at Merchant that is NOT super-attractive. So.)\n\nI really liked the service here, too - our waitress seemed very knowledgeable about what went into everything on the menu, but she also kept things very down-to-earth and less formal than I would've expected, which was nice. She was also very attentive and upfront about their gluten-free options.
