One of my favorite buffets in Vegas! (Besides Bacchanal, of course) \n\nThe weekend I came was Father's Day weekend so they had holiday pricing at $52\/person, but after tax it came out to be $56. There was a line, but it moved rather quickly and my party of four was seated in about half an hour. \n\nWicked Spoon has a large variety of different dishes you would expect at a buffet - various meats, seafood, sushi, salad, etc. They even have a seafood soup station, where you choose the kind of seafood you want and the chef will make the soup for you with the option of spicy or non-spicy. I always indulge in the king crab legs whenever I go to a buffet and luckily here, they have plenty. They even have this grapefruit, crab, and avocado \"salad\" served in a cute little jar that I absolutely fell in love with. Who knew crab and avocado could taste so good together?! (Actually, maybe everything tastes good with avocado if you're a fan like me). \n\nThe meat at buffets is usually a hit or miss, so I don't really judge too hard on that since it will probably come out tasting different each time. The lamb was a bit too chewy, but the brisket was perfect. Paired with the BONE MARROW that they have, mmmm! This was the first buffet I've been to that had bone marrow. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the food was rather salty. They have pho with oxtail broth, but the broth was extremely, extremely salty. In addition to that, our server kept forgetting to bring utensils and drinks that we asked for and at one point gave us sodas that we didn't order. *shrugs* The food was also constantly low and they were slow at refilling the items. I don't know if it was just because it was a busy night, or if they're always like that but that's a no-no at a buffet! \n\nBut still, the food that I did have was very good and I enjoyed every moment of Wicked Spoon. (I went back for more food even after I had dessert hehe) This is my second choice buffet when I don't want to spend the $$$ at Bacchanal, and it's well worth it!
