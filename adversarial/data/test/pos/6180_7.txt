Stay Away!!! We ordered from this place and we ALL got super sick with diarrhea, upset stomach, you name it!! The crispy ginger beef had NO BEEF; it was just fried doe with sauce. I don't even want to describe the other food we ate because the thought of it makes me want to vomit!\n\nFIRST & LAST FOR US!\n\nI wish they had a zero star rating!
