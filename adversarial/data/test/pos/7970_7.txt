I just moved to the Vegas and needed to find a place that offers sugaring instead of waxing. I found this place through Groupon - I figured I might as well try it for a reduced rate before picking my regular spot. \n\nDanielle is the only person there who does sugaring I believe. And she was great! I appreciated that she worked in large, long strokes so she could accomplish a lot with each pull. It was less painful and went by very quickly. She was efficient, friendly and nice to chat with.
