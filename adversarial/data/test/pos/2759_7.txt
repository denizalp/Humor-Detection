This was my first time visiting this salon, based on the recommendation of a friend and close proximity to my place.  The ambiance\/environment was impressive, and it did not take long to get serviced (even on a Saturday as a walk-in).  Now that those 2 highlights are out of the way...\n\nProblem #1:  The young lady who helped me failed to remove the clear polish from my previous pedicure prior to completing the pedicure and doing a buff.  I didn't realize at the time, otherwise I would have said something.  But imagine not getting your actual nail buffed - and then being charged $10 for the buffing.\n\nProblem #2a: While getting my pedicure, as the aesthetician was snipping my lateral nail fold (the tissue surrounding the border of the nail) she cut me.  At first it was no big deal - I flinched a little and didn't think too much of it.  Until it started bleeding profusely!  I'm not sure what she did wrong, but she must have cut me pretty deep, because my toe literally bled throughout the entire pedicure and manicure (not exaggerating at all).  The worst part of it all was that she never stopped to address me to say \"Sorry, I cut you. I'm going to make this right.\"  She just kind of kept working as if things were normal and blood wasn't dripping down my toe.  Once the pedicure was done she put a Band Aid on it and proceeded to do my manicure (not sure why I let her even finish but it was my birthday and I felt nice).  Even after the manicure, they took me to a room off to the side where it took 3 of them to finally get the bleeding to stop.  It wasn't until then that she apologized, or even acknowledged that she had cut me.\n\nProblem #2b:  You'd think with all of the blood, and attention being drawn, at the very least the pedicure itself would be free.  Right?  Wrong... They gave me $10 off - which equaled the the nail buff add on - which was halfway executed to begin with.  All in all, I left the nail shop in pain and with a Band Aid on my unbuffed toe.  But I got to keep $10!\n\nProblem #3: They had ridiculous surcharges for using credit and debit cards.\n\nI was supremely disappointed by this place and I will never return again.  Even my friend that recommended it has since had issues since their last visit and is no longer a customer.  I guess I'l have to keep driving out to Elaine's Nails to get the service I'm used to - too bad.
