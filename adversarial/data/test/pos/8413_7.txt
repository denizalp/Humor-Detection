OMG, you guys, I think I'm in love.  Maybe I've been stuck in the suburbs for too long, but I was so impressed with Citizen.  I finally had a chance to check it out, and during \"social hour\" no less.  I had been hearing about those barrel aged cocktails, so I had to give one a try.  I don't normally go for the bourbon and whiskey cocktails, so the waiter recommended the Pacific Coast Cocktail, and described it as \"sort of their version of sangria\".  It was really good, really strong and $5 to boot (during social hour).  I had to switch to wine after that because I didn't want to get completely wasted in front of a bunch of strangers.  I also took the liberty of ordering the bacon fat popcorn for the table because Holy Jesus.  Bacon.  Popcorn.  How could you go wrong?  You can't, and this was truly sent from heaven.  Or hell, maybe.  Either way, it was freaking amazing and I would eat it every day if I could.  \n\nI ordered the Short Rib, much to my boyfriend's chagrin.  I always seem to order what he wants, and then he has to order something else (sorrynotsorry).  Oh Lord, not to be a yelp stereotype here, but it was TO DIE for.  Short Rib?  Amazing.  Parsnip Mash?  Why didn't I think of this?  Swiss Chard?  Yes.  And it is gluten free, for those of you on that food trip.\n\nOur waiter was totally on top of things, made great suggestions, and was super sweet.  Basically, everything I ask for in a waiter.  And the atmosphere?  Yes, it has that \"cool, hipster vibe\" described by other reviewers, but I like it, and I didn't find it pretentious or snobby at all.  \n\nOverall, I want to go to CPH like EVERYDAY, but alas, I cannot.  I will settle for going as often as I can to enjoy their delicious food and libations.  And I encourage you to do the same.
