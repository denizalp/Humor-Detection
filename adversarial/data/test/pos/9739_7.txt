Still the best soondubu in the business. There was a brief lull in flavor due to a different pepper powder, but rest assured Mr. Tofu is still king! An extremely special soondubu flavor here, haven't found any other recipe that even comes close. Banchan are always made fresh daily and are consistently well-balanced salty, sweet and hot. \n\nMr. Tofu is boss! I would stack their flavors up against the best of Korean in LA, NYC, SF, SEA and YVR.
