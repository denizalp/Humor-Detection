After lunch one day, a friend of mine suggested to get something for dessert ... and that was how I was introduced to this delightful shop. I am very thankful for there was no way I would have found this corner ... (P\/S: It is in the corridor that links the Bay Adelaide center and Scotia Plaza - a few stores down the Second Cup).\n\nI am lactose intolerant and can't handle ice cream well. Also, I don't eat anything too sweet or creamy. deKEFIR fit the bill perfectly - it was sweet yet tart (good contrast and balance), frozen yet soft, clean and fresh (not too creamy) and best of all, HEALTHY! All the ingredients were fresh and can be customized .... granola, fruit etc. \n\nYou can choose from smoothie \/ parfait \/ waffle \/ soft serve. I sampled the soft serve without any trimmings and quite frankly, it tasted delicious all on its own. You can't say that for plain yogurt (or at least, I can't). I ate the waffle and it has spoiled me - I don't think I can eat the ones at Pacific Mall again. :)  \n\nThe ladies are super friendly and will spend the time to give you advice on what ingredients will go well together as well as a brief description on how each product differs. I really should go back for a granola parfait for breakfast soon ... and then a smoothie for the afternoon walk ... and then a soft serve for the trip home. Hehehehe.
