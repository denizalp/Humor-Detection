Wow!  What a great traditional Japanese restaurant this place is!\n\nEvery time I go to a highly rated sushi \/ Japanese restaurant, I find that often the review is based on amazing rolls like Rainbow, Spider and the other 39-50 names of rolls that are all gastronomic creations of edible goodness.  Lets face it, all those rolls are darn tasty and fun to order and eat for sure.\n\nHowever, when it comes to finding quality traditional Japanese food, it is much harder to find due to the explosion in LV of all these sushi restaurants as well as the AYCE style pricing. We have some of the best sushi restaurants for sure.\n\nTraditional food is also so awesome and Yuzu was exceptional in every aspect:\n\nSmall - Yes this place is small. And meant to be small. But it is very cozy and you automatically feel like you are going to be part of a wonderful intimate experience.\n\nService - You are immediately greeted by staff that are very pleasant and you know that they know their stuff.  They will seat you and get you ready.  You get this lovely scroll that is tied up which is your drink menu.  Tons of different sake to try!  You are not greeted by a loud and raucous \"Irrashaiimasu\" coming from all the chefs. More of a quiet and refined welcome.  Classy.\n\nThe Menu - Wow,  what about those choices?\n\na. Homemade Zaru Tofu - how many places can you go to in Las Vegas to experience this wonderful dish?  Tofu that is silky and soft with a wonderful creamy taste?  Served in a dish that you scoop out the tofu which has a thick yogurt like consistency.  Served with shaved green onion, minced ginger and a bit of Yuzukoshō .  I have had Yuzukoshō before, just never really knew what it was, but the waitress explained that it was a seasoning paste made of the citrus fruit yuzu, and peppers.  A very simple yet complex taste that added nicely to the Zaru Tofu.  You blend the green onion, ginger and Yuzukoshō on the tofu with a bit of bonita flavored soy sauce and what a great flavorful appetizer that is!  My first experience and I was impressed.\n\nb.  Homemade Yuba - I came here specifically to order this dish.  Tofu Skin!  yep, who would imagine that! This is a very delicate dish skimmed from the hot soy as it is being prepared. Previously, I have had this only dried and used it in cooking for Chinese style soups. Never fresh and of course, never home made. I was deeply impressed with it's mild subtle flavor. I also loved the texture. Most people that would order a Spider Roll may not eat this dish or care for it. However, to me, this was a fantastic order and I would do so again.\n\nc.  Poki Salad - I have never known great poki before until I came here. I would those those large cubed chunks of Poki at other places and thought that those were the bomb.  However, here, the Poki is again so slight and delicate. Thinly sliced, lightly flavored with a dash of sesame seed, Kaiware or radish sprouts, sittting on a bed of I am going to guess it was  Wakame, or cut dried seaweed reconstituted, and thinly sliced onion and avocado!  What?  Avocado?  Very nice, I loved this dish and its flavor.\n\nd.  Hamachi Sashimi - This was some seriously thickly sliced hamachi that i was not expecting.  After everything else was so thinly sliced, having this come out was different.  Served on some kind of quartz or rock crystal, it was so good and tasty. I have always had Sashimi very thin and this was surprisingly thick and very good. \n\ne. Cold Green Tea Zaru Soba -  I have had Zaru Soba many times and love it for those hot days.  Having the Green Tea flavored Zaru Soba was a new experience for me and also very good. I totally enjoy preparing the Soba sauce and mixing up all the spices to dip the soba into. That sauce itself is tasty.  The flavor of the Green Tea is very interesting. It is crazy to have that taste but also very different and good. I would order this again.\n\nf.  Amai Ebi and Uni Nigiri Sushi - OK, had to have my favorite Amai Ebi and Uni.  I had to ask them if they would fry the shrimp heads and they said yes they could do that. So I am not sure if they actually do this automatically.  Some places don't... Both of these are very good and enjoyed these. I would say it was the best, but certainly very good.\n\nOverall, I have to say that this place was a great experience for me and I would rank this as one of my best experiences in quality traditional Japanese Cuisine.\n\nThis is not going to be your best place if you like AYCE Sushi, Chicken or beef teriyaki, combination dinner dishes, or all those big sushi rolls and other goodies.\n\nHere, the foods and flavors are very unique.  I am coming back as I only explored the tip of their menu and there are so many things here that i want to try out.  The Salmon Aburi and their Hot Pots sound great too.  \n\nMost importantly, I cannot wait to make a reservation for their Kaiseki, specially prepared and unique haute Japanese menu that you need a three day reservation.  I am excited for that!
