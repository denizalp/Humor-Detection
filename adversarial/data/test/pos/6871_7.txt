Walking in to WinCo, I felt like I had just come to the U.S. from Soviet Russia and was seeing my first supermarket.  The place is massively huge, probably 150 x 300 yards.  Get some exercise before attempting, or get your exercise here.\n\nLots of retail employees have asked me the question, \"Did you find everything OK?\"  I generally find this to be an inane question because if I didn't find everything I wanted to purchase, what is the person going to do for me?  Special order it?  Yeah, right.  \n\nAt WinCo this is not a dumb question because if you didn't find something, it's because you didn't look hard enough, or because it doesn't exist.  They have -everything-.  Every grocery product that was ever issued a UPC bar code, they have.  Examples of what they have:  Hundreds of bulk items (poured from a dispenser or shoveled from a barrel into your plastic bag, you write the product number on the twist tie) including candies, grains, spices, nuts, cereals, trail mixes, pasta, spices, soup mixes, Tang, fruit punch mix, nacho cheese sauce mix, flax seed, wheat germ, cocoa powder, anything that is powdered or otherwise fungible is in one of maybe 100 lineal yards of barrels.  Yards after endless yards of shelves display endless products.  10 yards just for pickles and pickle relish.  Another 10 yards of Campbell's soup, same for beans, rice, canned fruits, canned veggies, on and on as far as the eye can see and then some.  They also have more varieties of produce, meat, and fresh dairy products than any competitor.  They even have a self-service peanut butter grinding machine.\n\nAnd everything they have is cheaper than at other grocers in Las Vegas (for example Wal-Mart & Smith's (Kroger)).  Some products are slightly cheaper, but most products are a LOT cheaper, and often there will be a sign indicating what the same product sells for at Wal-Mart and at Smith's.  Now that we have discovered the place, our bill tends to be about 2\/3 of what it was shopping at Wal-Mart.  You have to bag the groceries yourself, kind of like \"Food 4 Less,\" except the groceries actually cost less.\n\nAlso, WinCo claims to be \"employee owned\" which means they have an employee stock ownership plan that is 100% company funded, and from all appearances their employees enjoy good benefits.  While I'm sure the mileage of individual WinCo employees may vary, you can sleep better knowing that your purchases won't be supporting an allegedly sketchy company like Wal-Mart.\n\nThey take cash, checks and debit cards, but not credit cards.  Money orders are 30c and they charge reasonable fees for cashing payroll checks.  Store is open 24H; if you like to shop late at night like I do, you'll have no worries with crowds or lines as mentioned in some of the other reviews.\n\nAt the exit there are soda machines selling Shasta beverages for 35c\/can, Coke and Pepsi products and LaCroix flavored seltzers are 50c\/can.  Talk about not getting nickled and dimed to death!
