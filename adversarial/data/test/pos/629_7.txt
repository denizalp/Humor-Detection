There's better service to be had at Dennys. As the face of Total Rewards, I would have expected better. Having heard they serve top shelf liquor I was surprised to find out their best vodka is kettle one. I'm addition their orange juice has more pulp than juice. Generally when I have a screwdriver, I mean to drink it, not eat it.
