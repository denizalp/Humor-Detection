Fantastic food made to order, but tricky to find, and not a fast lunch.  Plan on getting the peach cobbler to go.\n\nThe focus here is on the food.  Mell's fried chicken is incredible, with or without waffles.  Her biscuits and gravy is amazing.  I've not had better catfish in Madison.  Her cobblers are out of this world when fresh, and well worth picking up even once they're in the fridge.\n\nThe food can be somewhat inconsistent, depending on who is working in the kitchen.  Sometimes the black eyed peas are better than I've ever had elsewhere; sometimes they're unremarkable.\n\nBeverage choices are limited to water and canned soda.\n\nYou'd do well to call your order in if you're looking for a lunch in under an hour, especially if you're going with a group of more than four.
