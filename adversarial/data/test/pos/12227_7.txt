This is the kind of bar that alcoholics go to. I mean, not that there's anything wrong with that, I just don't typically like to end my night by spilling beers in my lap like I saw some patrons doing here. There's always nice cars parked in the lot, but I don't know who's driving them.\n\nThe food is pretty gnarly, but I mean, it's bar food. It was really salty.\n\nIf you want drinks with any haste, I'd recommend going to the bar to order them. We sat in a booth and the bartender was making a point to ignore and otherwise tick off our waiter.\n\nIt's a small place, and one in a million crappy sports bars in Vegas.\n\nAlso, they were inexplicably playing \"Dancer in the Dark\" on three of their TVs. WTF? That's like one of the saddest movies of all time. It stars Bjork. Really? At a sports bar?
