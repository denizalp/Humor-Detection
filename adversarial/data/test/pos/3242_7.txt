When you find out that you're going to be locked in a room with 5 of your co-workers for an hour in the name of team building, it's natural to feel a little apprehensive. What if someone forgot the deodorant that morning? What if I need to pee?!?\n\nThe good news is that this place has good ventilation and an emergency button in case you need to visit the bathroom.\n\nThe even better news is that this was BY FAR the most interesting and fun team builder I've ever done. Forget about going bowling (those jokes about giant balls never get old) but being trapped in a room and working together to get out really made me appreciate the different skills of each person I was trapped with.\n\nEach room is themed differently (pirate, wine, video game) with a whole bunch of different puzzles or challenges that you need to solve to find the key and unlock the room. There's also only 60 minutes to solve the entire thing so you have the added pressure of the clock ticking down.\n\nBottom line - if you need a fun group activity that's different from the norm, this is a no-brainer. But thinking is involved, so bring your brain.
