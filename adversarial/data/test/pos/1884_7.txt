It might still smell like smoke... (when was that banned)\nThe tunes might be aggressive... (with TouchTunes on mobile you can play All I want for Christmas and nobody will know)\nThe pizza might be cooked in the same counter-top oven from the 80s (I bet they clean it)\nBut this place is a-ok by me. \nQuite the cast of characters, a slim tap line-up, plenty of spirits, and a couple of wines. \nAnd I can start a tab and throw a tip on there in one handy transaction. I like your style CC.
