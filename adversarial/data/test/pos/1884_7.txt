Went here on a Sunday night cause some short Viet promoter chick gave us free passes.  Heard this place used to be called Tangerine.  Was literally in here for only like 15-20 minutes or like 3-4 songs or something like that.  Got in for free in like 2 minutes since there was no line at all.  Mexican bouncer called me and my friend gangsters from San Jose and Garlic Town cause he was from the bay too.  Har har har...Funny guy, but yeah.\n\nThey had the Filipino DJs over here, so it was all ass bumpin hip-hop music getting bumped over here.  Too bad the place was small and the crowd wasn't as crackin.  Liked the music, not the venue or the crowd on a Sunday night.  I'm sure it's better on a Friday or Saturday night, but I'd probably rather spend a Friday or Saturday night in Vegas elsewhere like XS.  But good bump-n-grind hip-hop music over here if you're looking to party somewhere small and not as big in Vegas.\n\nMinus 2 stars for the Ed Farty gear!  Esta no bueno!!!
