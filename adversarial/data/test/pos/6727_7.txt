This is such a cute little coffee shop. It reminded me of Sambalatte except 294738% better coffee and the environment is the right amount of relaxing and interesting. \n\nDon't quote me on this but apparently Darak means attic in some sort of language so the place is decorated with things you'd find in an attic: suitcases, glass trinkets, and old-fashioned furniture. I found myself constantly looking around, discovering some new cute little detail to this place. Even the way the drinks and food are served to you is different. Mismatched mugs delivered on a wooden platter, accompanied by some little toy figurine. \n\nThe coffee is BEYOND anything I could've asked for. I had the White Mocha and it was perfection. I finally had my real life \"take a sip from coffee and get cream on your nose\" moment LOL. It was the perfect taste, perfect amount of whipped cream, and I prefer this over any other coffee shop any day. In fact, I'm going back tonight. My GF got the Pistachio drink...think pistachio ice cream in a cup, except hot and not too sweet. Honestly the best drinks I've had from a coffee shop. And OMG the honey toast was perfect. The bread has just the right amount of toastiness to it and the ice cream\/whipped cream\/almonds complimented it very well.\n\nMy only suggestion is for the staff to make sure they clean up the tables within a certain time of someone leaving. It was our first time there and out of the three areas that weren't occupied, two had dirty silverware and dishes on them. We had to move some stuff ourselves. Other than that, don't change a thing.
