i had a coupon that i purchased online. i brought it into long wongs which was for an extra large pepperoni or cheese pizza and 2 dozen wings. i gave the coupon to the bartender and she said she didnt know how to process that and the owner would have to do that.  i asked her if there were free refills on the sodas and she said yes. i said ok and the owner put the info into the computer and then said what do you want to drink. i said one diet coke and 2 regular cokes. he said ok i will give these to you. they were in paper cups w\/lids and straws and said coke on the outside.  there were 3 of us in there eating. my friend and her bf and myself. i told him i wanted light on the sauce for 1\/2 of it and he said i have to put some sauce on it. i said yes light is some sauce. i told him to do light on sauce for the cheeese andpepperoni for the regular 1\/2. the bartender brought us out the 2 dozen garlic\/parmesan wings that we ordered. then she brought out the pizza approx 10 mins later. she asked if we were ok and needed anything and i said some more napkins. my friend went up to get myself and her a refill. then she asked later if everything was ok and my friend asked her for to -go containers. she brought out a couple and my friend put the rest of the wings in there. we left and then a few mins later my friend realized she left her cell phn there and she went back and she said the bartender told her sm1 turned it in. anyways the next day the owner called me 6 times on my cell phone from a # i didnt recognize. it wasnt the business phn #. i finally answered it wondering who kept calling and didnt leave msgs. then the owner accused me of not paying a bill. i told him i gave him my coupon for the wings and pizza and he said i didnt pay the bill. i said we didnt receive a bill and then he said i had to pay him for the 4 drinks we received. i said there were only 3 of us in there. then he kept changing the amount he said i owed. and was harrasing me telling me he was going to call the police on me and press charges for the sodas. i said if i would've gotten a bill for the sodas i would've paid it but i didnt. i told him that he told me he was giving me the sodas. he kept changing his story around and i will never ever go back there bcuz i was treated like i was some kind of criminal. i dont need to be harrased and aggravated  from sm1 that is very unprofessional and rude like he was. i give this place 2 thumbs down!!!
