(Lyrics - Elvis Presley - Good Luck Charm)\n\nI want a 5 star restaurant\nI want some old Thai food\nWant your food cause I just can't miss\nWith a place called Charm like you\n\nCome on and join me a little bite at Charm\nUh-huh huh, you spicy delight\nI want a place like Charm\na-hungry man like me\nTo have, to have, to try, to try tonight\n\n\nCharm is in the prime real estate in the heart of downtown Chandler.  I love coming down to this part of the town during the weekends, and rather prefer it over Scottsdale.\n\nI came to Charm for a quick bite with a buddy of mines.  The place is still the same from the original Thai restaurant from what I remembered; modern furnishings with traditional Thai decors.  \n\nThey start you off with serving a vegetable broth here which I didn't really care for.  I thought it was tad bit too salty but my buddy drank all of his and mines!  I ordered the Drunken Noodles for my entree while my buddy shot for the traditional Pad Thai.  Overall, my noodles were good, but I wish they used more of the glass noodles which I'm accustomed to, but instead I got the large flat noodles like Pad See Ew.  The noodles were still good and I did order a medium spice; but boy did it kick my in the booty.  I guess my weak ass should have ordered mild haha!  I had a taste of my buddies Pad Thai and it was pretty solid and not spiced as he ordered haha!\n\nIn the end, Charm is a delight and welcoming atmosphere.  My expectations can be high at times, but Charm will do just fine for a quick bite and drink! - Enjoy!
