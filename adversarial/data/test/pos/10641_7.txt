Came here during lunch. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would. I thought the food options were limited. \n\nThey also need to do a better job at keeping their food warmer. \n\nWe came in around 2pm so we waited until 3pm so the dinner food would come out. I thought there would be more but it was the same amount as lunch food. \n\nI heard good things about this buffet but I was disappointed. I thought the food was mediocre.
