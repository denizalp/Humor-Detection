Grand opening was this morning, with a line all the way down the plaza three stores down. Apparently, west side Vegas is excited about fresh produce and Double Ad Wednesday.\n\nEnthusiastically friendly staff and a few camera guys from the news were present to open a clean and organized new store, with the same layout as others in town so you already know where to look for your favorite items.\n\nThere were a few opening-specific sales prices but mostly it was a new location going right to work with the usual business of Sprouts: fresh produce at low prices, with organic options available, and lots of eco-friendly health and beauty brands.
