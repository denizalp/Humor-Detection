Right off the bat, I want to let everyone know that I enjoy their food. However, as with most of the other Yelpers, I have to agree that the service is lackluster at best. \n\nAs for the food, I really enjoy their Turkey BLT sandwich and their cheese fries- soo good! And by the way- they have buy one get one free regular sized sandwiches after 4PM on Tuesdays, meaning that two sandwiches, two drinks, and two bags of chips are only around $10. Slammin' deal. \n\nHowever, each and every single time my boyfriend and I come here there is ALWAYS an issue with the service. \n\nFor example, one Tuesday we came here and ordered the BOGO sandwiches. Mine was the Turkey BLT with everything on it and his was the Turkey BLT minus the lettuce and tomato. We waited nearly 50 minutes to get our food which was absolutely outrageous considering that there were maybe 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant. Not to mention when the food came out, my boyfriend's sandwich had lettuce scraps on it (the lettuce is shredded). No, they didn't put lettuce on by mistake and leave it there, they put it on the sandwich, must have realized that it was incorrect and then haphazardly picked it off. This is what really bothered me. If you make something incorrectly, make it again. For all they know, he could have had an allergy to the lettuce (which he doesn't, but still the same principle applies) and he could have gone into anaphylactic shock. Not cool. Whatsoever. But since he's not allergic to lettuce, he just spent a good five minutes picking the remnants away. \n\nAnother Tuesday we came here, and it was a night where the Flyers (Philadelphia's NHL team) were playing in the first round of the playoffs. The place was at about 1\/4 capacity. Being a Philadelphia-oriented restaurant, we were shocked to see telenovelas playing on TV. So, after we ordered, I got back in line and waited my turn to get to the front counter. Once I got there, I politely asked the guy working there if when he had a chance if he could turn on the Flyers game. He looked me dead in the face and said \"Yeeeeeah, that's probably not going to happen...\" Shocked, I said ok and walked back to our booth. One of the patrons behind me must have said something to the guy because he walked over to our table and mentioned something about how he told him what channel the game was on. So rude and belittling. Not to mention we waited another 30 minutes for our food. \n\nThe third time we came here, my boyfriend ordered cheese fries to go and THAT'S IT! He waited 25 minutes for french fries and a cup of cheese wiz. Really? And not to mention, they must have sat the to-go bag down on a wet counter because as we were carrying the fries into our house from the car, the soaked bottom of the bag tore and our fries ended up on the floor. Really not cool. At all. \n\nOverall the service sucks, but the food is good. Oh, and just a tip for you guys, if you feel like you're going to want Corleone's for lunch, order it at 9:30 AM for it to be ready on time.
