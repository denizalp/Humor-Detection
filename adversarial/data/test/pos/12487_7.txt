Simply the best place for a homeowner to buy citrus trees in the valley.\n\nTrees are locally grown. Arizona soil. Arizona climate. Makes a huge difference. Speaking of huge, the root balls are larger than those of trees sold at most non-specialty retailers. The larger ball adds to the challenge of transporting and planting, but it helps the tree get established much faster. The trees pictured in the photograph posted range roughly in price from $65 to $85, very fair for a superior product. You'll also be able to select from multiple varieties of lemons, oranges and grapefruit, not just from one or two. The staff, you may be talking to an owner, are very knowledgeable, and will talk you through specific advantages and disadvantages of each variety. There are significant differences not just in fruit, but tolerance to sun, speed of growth, and so on. \n\nGreenfield Citrus Nursery is locally owned. There are live peacocks and chickens wandering about the property. This day, we just dropped in just to see the birds. The kids loved it. The staff was not at all annoyed and seemed pleased when we told them the three trees we had purchased from them were thriving. \n\nOne more thing. You don't have to buy a tree. If you aren't able to buy all the fruit you want at the Orange Patch next door, there are often lemons, oranges and grapefruit for sale very cheaply at Greenfield's.
