Beautiful place and a great atmosphere, a large group of us go  to the Cascade about 3 to 4 times a week for years, met dozens of loving waitresses  in that place until our last trip where we dealt with  a waitress (want to be) name some ( flora .......) that gangster attitude  did not belong around people whatsoever, her main answer was (haaaaaaaaaaaaa) and that comes with a look...............\n She had no idea about the menu except for how awful everything was, how a lot of people do not like this or that on the menu. \nSaw her twice in our 2 hours visit,(haaaaaaaaaaaaaa)\nVery very bad attitude no experience and extremely rude. (*haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa).\nWe will be calling ahead from now on to be sure she won't be working on the days we decide to go.\nOtherwise, never never never again.
