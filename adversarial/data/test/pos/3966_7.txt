This a little whole in the wall. I was debating the 5 star with this place because its not like its the taj mahal....however the food is solid and the prices are very fair. They are also open 24\/7. I like the convenience and the close proximity to my house. so far i havent gotten a bad meal...its also a nice choice from whatever is open at 2 am....in fact i dont think there is much else open at that time
