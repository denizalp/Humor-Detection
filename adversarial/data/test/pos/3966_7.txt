Even though I live in Chicago I've been to the High Noon a few times. The sound is excellent, and I enjoyed the video screen for my recent visit during the Carnivale show featuring the incredible Handphibians. \n\nBeer prices aren't bad, and service is pretty quick. It's great that they have the two bars to serve the rowdy masses. Door people are polite and allow frequent exits\/entrances for smokers to enjoy a grit on their nice enclosed patio. \n\nI had visited the old O'Cayz many times, and it's a great service to the community that the owner decided to invest, rebuild and actually IMPROVE upon that venue. If you're going to quibble about paying a few extra bucks for a show, just be thankful you're not standing in a pool of musty beer or urine somewhere else. It's money well spent!
