The best show on the Strip hands down!  It blows away all other Cirque shows including 'O'.  I have seen it multiple times and would still pay to see it again.  This is the only show I can recommend to friends visiting town and be positive that they will leave pleased and impressed with such a memorable experience.  \n\nThe multimillion dollar spinning\/flying\/transforming stage is a technological wonder in itself.  Incredible choreography and athleticism displayed by the performers.  I'm baffled as to how they aren't injured or killed on a nightly basis...no live lions in the show helps I guess?  \n\nIf you're going to shell out the big bucks to see a Vegas show, this is one that is worth every penny!\n\n*Insider tip*\n\nSee if they have any specials running for local residents (if you are or know a Vegas local that is.)  Sometimes they offer up to 50% off tickets with local Nevada ID.
