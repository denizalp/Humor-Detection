This evening was long and strange...\n\nWe came in on Saturday night before heading over to see Chelsea Handler at Time Warner, apparently not just our idea! This place got very busy very quick! Our reservation was for 5:45 we checked in and then just stood there no one made any moves! I finally walked to the side and we waited about 5 mins and then were brought to the worst table in the place...the booth right by the door, with the crowds of people and the chill from outside, not gonna happen! I asked to be moved they had a whole restaurant full of tables that were empty, they put us right behind the 1st booth they tried to give us...\n\nFree Guacamole compliments to my sister for printing this coupon up!! Guacamole was HUGE and very tasty my sister hates cilantro so we had it without...she ruins everything!!  They make it table side and while putting on his latex gloves asked \"who would like and exam\" sooooo creepy! Now don't get me wrong I am not that stuck up and do have a sense of humor, but it was totally out of left field!! CREEPY!\n\nMoving on to dinner I had the Shrimp taco's the shrimp were cold unfortunately but we had no time to waste since we had a show to catch, I ate them. It had come with Sweet Plantains and Grilled Corn, the Plantains were good and the Grilled corn was served cold just like my shrimp, but had the potential of being good.\n\nI Like to drink, like A lot!! So we tried a number of the drinks they offered. Starting with the Skinny Girl Margarita- only served Up which to me is weird because its much easier to do it over ice, but fine! Then I had the Sangria-red I hadn't read the description before ordering it thinking that it would be like every other Sangria I've ever drank, WRONG this is served with Tequila in it!! It was gross why put Tequila with wine? why??? I Chugged that down because our server was no where to be found and I was gonna have to pay for it! * Pinch Nose and Chug* then moved on to the Prickly Pear Margarita no salt or sugar please....or not! Not my favorite either it was a different kind of sour it was just ok. Moved on to a regular Margarita NO SALT please...or not! It was fine can't really re-invent it so I had two!! \n\nService was awkward all through the night! Never mind the \"Guacamole Guy\", but it was everyone that approached our table. It was like it was everyones first night serving EVER! I know our server wasn't young probably 30's and it was as if he has never done this before. I know they just opened, but not yesterday and it seemed from the minute we got there it was a Cluster F*!@ (sorry but it was). I may come back but I'm in no rush to do so.
