You're probably not coming here by choice. You're probably coming here because your favourite band is playing here and you would go to anywhere your favourite band is playing, right?\n\nBut this really is a place that makes an effort to bring you back (and I have!). From the polite bouncers to the engaging ticket collector, from the servers to the bartenders, everyone is nice here. it's a refreshing change.\n\nFood is good but not great. It's Mexican food and there is no shortage of that around here. Drinks are cold, service is quick, acoustics are good for the bands.\n\nI'd recommend.
