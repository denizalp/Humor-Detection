Not bad. It's a discount \"dollar\" theater- regular prices are $2\/flick with Tuesday getting you half off. It's not in the best part of town and it's predictably run down. But the picture and sound quality are decent, and with movies leaving theaters so quickly, it isn't long til you see the blockbusters show up here. Ticket line can be long, especially on Tuesdays, but they do offer online ticket purchase. Note that there is a 50-cent card charge to do so, but that still comes to 1\/5 what you'd spend elsewhere on the ticket alone. Other reviews state that this place is cash-only but I didn't see signage indicating so. I'm not a concessions gal so I can't tell you anything about that situation, but the usher\/security guard was friendly when checking my bag and letting me in. The most important thing I'd impart is getting here early- some of the seats can be uncomfortable, so the sooner you arrive, you can move around if needed.
