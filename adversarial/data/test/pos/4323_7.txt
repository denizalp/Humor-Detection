Big fatty breakfast. This is what my review is about. My favorite Madison girls and I hit this place up every weekend that I'm around town. Refill my bottomless coffee mug one more time- This is where we hit reset in the morning.\nPrices are cheap, food is hearty and filling, and its a German pub..\nWhen you order breakfast, the following drinks are only $1 extra (unreal!) : Coffee, mimosas, bloody marys, beer (no joke- who the f orders a beer with breakfast outside of Wisconsin? or in Wisconsin for that matter??), juices, milk, or tea..\nThe food isn't a culinary art, but this place feels like home.
