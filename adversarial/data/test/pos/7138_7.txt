Just had dinner there tonight with wife and child.  We were seated right away.  Our food took over an hour to come. Upon asking the waitress why, she promptly said - \"cook is very busy\" looking around the inside of the place and it was pretty empty.    Once it arrived the food was average quality, salads were decent size, I got a taco and for as much as it cost was an appetizer size.   I left hungry.  Even hostess said tacos are more like appetizers.    Sirena is extremely over priced and if hungry for Mexican go across the street to Chipotle to get your money's worth.    \n\nI will not be back - sorry Peters Twp people that think it is a great place, it is not.
