Simply the tops. Black Dog presents to you the best BBQ in a 50-state area. Its welcoming and knowledgeable staff will serve you a rotating cast of beers and a stable of meats and sauces that rivals anywhere you've ever been. The burnt ends are probably considered to be the specialty here, and they're typically out of them by 1 or 2 due to the popularity, but the true specialty is just outstanding, mouthwatering food. Aside from the everyday options of pulled pork, brisket, ribs and catfish, they also have great daily specials, such as pork tacos on Tuesday and an incredible cuban sandwich on Wednesday. And not to be forgotten, the sides and appetizers are killer as well.\n\nThe long wait at usual dinner and lunch hours is well documented, but there is a wait because everyone who's heard of the place dreams of eating all of their meals there, all of the time.\n\nIf you're stopping in for the first time, you'll never go wrong with a cornbread appetizer, sides of pit beans and twice baked potato casserole, and pulled pork with the georgia peach sauce.
