There are not enough black holes (you know, those things that suck in stars?) in the universe to rate this insanely bad airline.\n\nOh, would that I have read these other reviews before I subjected myself to their excessive fees, lousy customer service, long lines, long waits, ancient airplanes, nickel-and-diming ($3 for water? Really?), and complete lack of anything resembling leg room.\n\nAdd to that the 45-minute wait for my single 20# bag (that cost me $70 to check - since it would have cost me $80 to carry on) - and the little tirade from the check-in counter girl about how we are \"privileged\" to fly with Spirit (she might just want to look that word up. I think she got it crossed with the word \"screwed\").\n\nI cannot say this strong enough: AVOID SPIRIT AIRLINES AT ALL COSTS. 2,500+ complaints to the BBB can't be a good sign. Sure, they are all \"closed\" (which, I'm sure, has nothing to do with the fact that a business has to PAY to be listed with the BBB), but - hello? How many more before this stinkpit of an airline goes out of business, and deservedly so?\n\nHopefully soon.\n\nBy the way, after  you pay all their fees, you actually would have paid less to fly a real airline like Southwest or Alaskan. Just sayin'.
