This Village Pub & Poker is located near the Valley Automall in Henderson. It's location is also near a neighborhood and Touro University, it's a pretty busy area but good for business. I like to drop in to this Village Pub every so often to always get great customer service and good food. \n\nSome of the food I've had here included but limited to, their Fish & Chips, chicken fried chicken, dinner salad, onion rings, and steak fries. I gotta say one of my fav's is their Fish & Chips. I've been to other places where it's been just OK but this Village Pub cooks it very delicious in taste, flaky and crisp just right. \n\nTheir Fish & Chips are made with Icelandic Cod, this  might be the reason why it's so good and I tend to find myself going back for more. But all-in-all I've haven't received nothing but really good customer service here and the wait, if there is any, has always been short on their pretty busy days. I'll be back for more food, maybe trying something different for a slight change. I like this place!
