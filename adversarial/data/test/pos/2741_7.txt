Reading all the reviews about this place, I was cautiously optimistic about our meal here. I purchased the Groupon for this location. I came with my fella and our friends for a nice evening out and thought it would be a great opportunity to share the bottle of wine. \n\nI made reservations and we arrived at 7 on the dot on Saturday evening for our dinner reservation. The table layouts weren't my favorite. Large bench seating where we ended up sharing a table with another couple. I would expect this at a lower end restaurant but when you're paying $30 for a burger, I was kind of hoping for a table on our own. Every move the couple next to us made or word they spoke, I heard or felt it and it became a little annoying as the evening wore on. \n\nThat being said, I did enjoy our meal quite a bit, despite the same problems everyone else seems to have had with getting a medium or medium-rare burger. Both my friend and myself ordered the kobe and he specifically asked for medium-rare while I asked for medium and they both came out looking exactly the same. Cooked all the way through with no pink in the middle. I can't complain too much since the burger was still extremely moist and flavorful. My other friend ordered the angus and it accidentally came out with cheese on it even though she didn't order it that way. We told the waiter and he apologized and took it back. He brought back her burger with no cheese on it but she noticed that they had just scraped the cheese off instead of making her a new burger. She wasn't too annoyed but it didn't sit well with any of us. The fries and onion rings we ordered were nothing special. They lacked flavor and texture. They definitely could use more seasoning. For dessert my fella and I shared the mango cheesecake which was served in a glass. The flavor was great. The brownie dessert my friends shared didn't impress them too much, but I didn't get to taste that so can't comment on it.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. On a few occasions, the waiter forgot to get us some extra napkins and refills on water, but overall the service was good. I don't see myself going out of my way to come back, but we did have a good meal and would love to come back if they offered another coupon. If I had not had the Groupon our meal would have been well over $160 for three burgers, a side of fries, a side of onion rings, an order of buffalo wings, a bottle of wine and two desserts. \n\nOverall, we had a nice meal with a few minor blips.
