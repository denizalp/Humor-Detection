Oh my goodness, I've found a new favorite place! \n\nHubby was in the mood for Mexican and suggested the usual suspects. But I wanted something new and exciting! I also wanted something casual and affordable. Based on their website, this place fit the bill. And they didn't disappoint!\n\nWe visited around 6p on a Wednesday evening. There was only one other full table when we arrived and it didn't get any busier throughout our stay. \n\nThe front of the menu listed their specials and the loaded Tots immediately caught my eye. They also do a loaded nacho\/fry which comes in small or large. But that only comes with one meat. These Tots came in one size and was loaded with THREE meats - bulgogi, bacon and pork Belly! Woah!! Need I say more? It was fantastic! Hubby and I are pigs, so we definitely could've used a bigger size portion. But it ended helping us save room so we could try a few more items. \n\nHubby couldn't resist some tacos, so we went with one calamari and one pork Belly. He was pretty crazy about the former. It was definitely bigger and packed full of more food than most of these Gourmet tacos that are so popular nowadays.\n\nNext we went for the Bulgogi Tortas. They take a patty of white rice, deep fry it and cover it with meat and vegetable goodness! The outside of the rice patty was crispy, while the inside was soft and perfectly soaked up all the juices from the meat. Apparently this dish was featured on a Food Network show. And I can see why - it is unique and delicious!\n\nWe were nearing the point of being full, but everything was so good that we just had to try one more! Because I love cheese, we chose the Bulgogi Empanadas. The cheese was melted to perfect ooey Gooey-ness. And the tortilla it was wrapped it was one of the most amazing things I've ever had! It had a very light crisp on the outside and the inside was fluffy - not over-fried and dried. \n\nWhen our waitress brought the bill, she also brought a complimentary dessert of half an orange! How refreshing. \n\nMy one and only complaint - they advertise that if you pay with cash you get 5% off. But for some reason we didn't get it....\n\nWe can't wait to go back to this place! Those oases Tots and the empanadas need to happen again. And maybe something new like the bacon fried rice?
