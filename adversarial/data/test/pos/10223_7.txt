This is my new hang out for me and coco...i like that its enclosed and i can let her roam free. She is still getting over the fact that she is not human and its a bit of an adjustment getting used to to the other dogs but day by day she is improving. The people are mostly friendly...i will say the worst part is that people don't pick up after their dogs and i have the occasional run in with a nice steaming pile.Other then that its nearby home and is a nice change for us both.
