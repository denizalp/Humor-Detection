My search for pho nirvana in the GTA has found a new winner in Vietnam Noodle Star. THIS IS IT! Thanks to Neil and Katrina for introducing this place to me, they really know their stuff. Mind you it's far in the burbs' where all the good ethnic food haunts typically are but it's worth it if you can find transportation. So I was lucky enough to be brought here this past weekend with fellow yelpers Neil and Susan. Our trip was a rewarding experience 'cuz the pho here is sublime! In other words, I could stick my head in a vat of it and inhale happily. \n\nTo start with, the broth is gorgeous, enticing and complex. It's so good and it's a main reason why the pho here is outstanding. Slightly salty too but the strong tones of star anise balance it out. The noodles are fresh and they give you a healthy portion in every serving for your slurping pleasure. There is also a lot of meat in each bowl as well and it's thinly sliced and does not shrivel up into curly bits unlike other pho joints. It was the also the first time I tried tendon in pho, a tasty addition with it's gooey, jello like texture! The herb plate had the standard bean sprouts, basil and lime, no saw but when you have a pho this good, I can do without. \n\nThis place meets the holy trinity of requirements on my list for a phenomenal bowl of pho: fresh noodles, thinly sliced beef and richly flavoured stock. If only they could expand downtown damnit! Until then, I'm left pestering friends with cars for trips out here.
