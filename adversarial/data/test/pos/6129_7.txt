I come here once a year to see the Cactus Garden at night with the Christmas lights.  It is such a treat to see.  I also enjoy watching the chocolatiers at work if the factory is running.  Last night, it wasn't.  Last year when I stopped in, I saw them making some Valentine's Day boxes and it was quite interesting.  This is also a good place to take out of town visitors to see the gardens in the daytime even when not decorated. \n\nI am not a fan of the price of the chocolate.  I think it's way overpriced.  \n\nTip #1:  If you go to see the lights and you don't have children, go about 9 PM.  The gardens are open until 10.  At that time, most if not all the little ones have gone home, and you almost have the gardens to yourself.  It's heaven.\n\nTip #2:  On the way, point out Wayne Newton's house and look at the fin of his jet parked on the other side of the wall.  It looks like something out of a bad Jaws movie.
