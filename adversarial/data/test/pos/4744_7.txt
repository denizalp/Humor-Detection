Oh man this place is awesome!! I walked out with a very heavy box of booze for $85.\n\nBleu cheese stuffed olives, Gibson onions, Stoli, giant bottle of Bombay Sapphire, Vermouth, six-pack of Stella, Three Philosophers beer, cheap shiraz. \n\nWal-Mart is to white-trash as Bevmo is to Nathan \"Bear Hands\" S.\n\nThe staff was super helpful-friendly. The girl at the counter even gave me an extra $10 discount. Jesi thinks it is because I signed up for their discount card; I think it is because I am super cute. Either way, if anyone wants to know where to Christmas shop for me...
