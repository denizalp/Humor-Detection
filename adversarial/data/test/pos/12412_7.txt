I have been in here several times since it is just up the street from where I work and also in the same shopping center as my hubby's favorite restaurant, Fogo de Chao.  Almost every time I go in, I come out empty handed.  I am not really a thrift-store shopper, but I love the idea of being able to get designer\/couture items that are gently used for less.  I just can't seem to ever find anything that I actually think is a good deal.\n\nThrift store lovers I am sure will love this place since after their expansion several months ago, it really is a beautiful store with lots of space, nice displays and a bunch of dressing rooms.  Their selection of plus-sized clothes is very lacking so I don't usually do much shopping for clothes but they also have a really nice selection of jewelery that changes quickly.  They have a wide variety of upscale purses and shoes which is what I spend most of my time looking at but anything that is less than $100 is more than gently used.  I can't bring myselft to buy something that is dirty and seriously worn or even ripped no matter what brand it is.  Their \"almost new\" designer pieces are usually behind glass and so you have to get someone to unlock the case for you.  The other reviewers have already discussed the level of service you get at this store so this can be a hassle.  I was very close to paying $300 for a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes there recently until I realized that it is crazy to pay that much for shoes that someone else has worn.  I mean, yes, it was much cheaper than retail.  But I think you would do better on the price to wait for a sale at Neiman Marcus, or visit the Sak's outlet in AZ Mills, or just hunt online at a site like Blue Fly.  Why pay that much and still run the risk that they are fakes or were owned by someone with a foot fungus?
