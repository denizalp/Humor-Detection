Ordered Brisket sandwich Fri evening. We inquired about the prime rib. They seemed to think they would have a run on it so they suggested we make a reservation.We came in on Sunday and ordered the prime rib. It comes with NO Sides. My husband ordered corn on the cob (1\/4 of an ear for $2.00 and no butter) and we both had cole slaw. $32.00 They served the meat on a metal tray covered with brown wrapping paper which tore when we tried to cut the.meat. The meat was under cooked and luke-warm, and they only have plastic utensils. The plastic knife would not cut the meat. So we packed up the food to go, took it home, reheated the meat, ate it on plate with silverware, like human beings. It seems like the owner spent a lot on decor and cheaped out on everything else. \nThe place was being run by teenagers who could not care less. The cole slaw is in a refrigerator in syrofoam cups behind the ordering line. They don't have a dish to save their lives, and they admitted to not having any silverware at all.\nStick with the sandwiches. My husband says it was the worst prime rib he ever had. They gave me the end piece, hiding the end underneath. The meat was half fat and disgusting. We were very disappointed. Two stars is us being generous.
