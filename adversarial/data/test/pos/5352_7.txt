If you've had Bacchanals at Caesar Palace, this place is MEH. Nothing special and you have to have SLEEVES to get in.. to a buffet???!! It is 100 degrees out and my friend was wearing a tank either had to leave or buy a 12$ t shirt from the cashier.\n\nLmao I walked into bacchanals wearing jean shorts and a plain shirt before - no complaints.\n\nMaybe it's the wynn. Shrug.
