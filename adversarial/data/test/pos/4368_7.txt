One of the illegals they have working there broke my driver's seat (the upper back part) and when I brought it to the manager's attention they of course said they weren't liable. I don't know if the guy did it on purpose or not, but it definitely was not broken before I took the car to them, and to break it at that point in the seat I imagine you would have to put a lot of pressure on it.
