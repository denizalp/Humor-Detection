I was on the verge of giving DelFriscos a 4 star review (really, it was closer to 4.5 stars), but the banana bread pudding at the end (spoiler alert!), pushed me over the edge to 5 star status! I'm sorry for starting at the end of the meal, but that was one of the best desserts I've ever had! It was like sex on a plate. I'm not even a big banana fan (hee hee), but I love bread pudding, so I thought I'd give it a shot. WOW! It was amazing, like banana bread and bread pudding went out on a few dates and decided to have a baby. And the ice cream paired with it- omg.. I may return and just order dessert!\n\nOk, let's get to the meat of the review (see what I did there?). Dining with the self proclaimed \"King of DelFrisco (DC)\", was mildly amusing, because many of the servers came to speak with him and compare restaurant locations. I started with the VIP cocktail, which was perfect. Pineapple taste, but not overwhelmingly sweet, very smooth, really lovely. We got the shrimp cocktail (with all the sauces), and the crab cake for appetizers. I enjoyed them both, the crab cake was light, very little filler, but could have used a touch more seasoning. I still ate almost all of it, though! \n\nI ordered the prime ribeye as my entree, medium rare. This was one of the first times I wished I had ordered it medium. It was just a smidge under for my taste. To be fair to DelFrisco, the server did ask me to cut it in the middle to see if it was prepared to my liking. I just didn't want to be rude and send it back. It was seasoned really well and had great flavor, but a couple more seconds on the flame would have been perfect for me.\n\nWe ordered the lobster Mac and cheese for our side dish, and it was very creamy, cheesy, with some lobster chunks, although not a lot. Like the crab cake, I did think it could have used more seasoning, though. \n\nBtw, the bread was soft and warm, and the server gave us a fresh loaf when she boxed our leftovers. Speaking of service, it was attentive and friendly throughout. We had a few people waiting on our table, and the manager came by to check on us as well.\n\nOf course, DelFriscos isn't a cheap meal, so do prepare to spend. I believe that our meal, which included 2 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 1 side dish, and 1 dessert, was about $230. Pricey, but well worth it!
