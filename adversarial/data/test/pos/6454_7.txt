Cool little place.  Horrible area.  And I say that because I have been told I lived in one of the worst parts of town.  But if possible, this might even top it.  To make matters even more challenging, you almost can't map your way to their front door, so you may get lost in the manufacturing wasteland that surrounds this little gem.  Or end up at Bojangles.  Work through the pain.  It's worth it.\n\nWe actually went for the Dining in the Dark event, to benefit a charity for the visually challenged.  As such, we didn't get to see much of the place.  At least, not once the blindfolds came down.\n\nHowever, the experience was cool.  It's different than what you see on television through the nightvision cameras.  Those generally don't seem to have you blindfolded for one, or skanky hos doing nasty things when they think no one is watching.  But as we were actually there with other diners, the blindfolds were required.  It also gave the \"normals\" something to laugh at.  Sort of a built-in entertainment if you will.\n\nI can't really say much about the service, as I didn't drink much of my water, not wanting to spill it on myself, the people I dined with, the table or the floor.  So the glass may very well have been empty the entire time.  The whole process did seem to go a bit slow - though that could have been because they were trying to serve twenty blindfolded people and talk them through their meal while keeping up with regular diners as well.\n\nAs to the food, it was really good.  I just wish there was more of it.  When you're dining and concentrating only on the food, it's so much better.  It may have not looked like much - or it may even have looked outstanding - but it tasted phenomenal.  I am sure that I ate things that I may not even have ordered in a normal setting, and I probably looked ridiculous doing so, but I enjoyed the process immensely.\n\nFinally found the menu, and it consisted of oxtail-stuffed ravioli, veal strip loin with ostrich pate, purple peruvian potatoes and a lemoncello pancetta on almond shortdough.  For those that were wondering.  I have no idea if this is a typical meal or if it was special for us.
