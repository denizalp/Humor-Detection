Some reviews have claimed Loop to have the best iced latte. I agree! But I have also discovered that they have the best iced chai latte too. A good chai is hard to find...and they've done it!\n\nAlthough, I've been feeling kinda weird walking in there lately, because one of the baristas has been wearing an eye patch, and I'm not sure whether it's 'cause he hurt his eye, or because he's doing an ironic-pirate thing. Not gonna ask.
