Met up with an SPJ group for networking event. The outdoor ambience was relaxing and just set apart enough for our group. Mini deli sandwiches were prepared for us, and we all ordered drinks from the supremely affable bartender. There's probably 100 different types of beers\/wines here...I didn't have time to browse all the gourmet groceries...it was an ideal marriage of tasty food and atmosphere this last day of April. I guess I'll go inside next time I'm here; it's about to get so hot! Edit: they tell me they have misters too, and not just the masculine variety. ;)
