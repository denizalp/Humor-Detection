We ate here for lunch.  The only option is the pre-fixe lunch for approximately $26 per person.  It's 3 courses with about three to four choices per course.  It's a fantastic deal. \n\nFor appetizers, I had the Maryland crab cake which was scrumptious.  I also sampled the grilled octopus and the salad from my companions all of which tasted outstanding.\n\nFor entrees, I had the Mediterranean sea bream which was perfectly seasoned.  It had a light butter sauce to the side and was quite a large portion for me.  Others had the lobster pasta and the salmon.  All were terrific.  What I liked about the the dishes was that the fish were either wild or farmed with no hormones and no antibiotics.  Food safety is important and the quality of the ingredients where you dine should be just as important as how the meal tastes.\n\nFor dessert, there was cake with ice cream but I had the Greek yogurt.  I didn't have much because I was already so full from the rest of the meal.  \n\nThere is ample seating in the main dining room but if you can, opt for the patio area.  It's covered but you get fresh air and a little bit of sun not to mention a fantastic view of the strip.  Wow!
