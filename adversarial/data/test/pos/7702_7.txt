I have been dying to check out Creamistry for over a year, but have not been around this side of town until today. It was easy to find and plenty of parking with quite a few cute stores to shop in before or after our treat. When my daughter and I stopped in it was pretty empty with only one couple in front of us, but it quickly got busy.  The store was very clean, and had some great music playing.  We were greeted right away with a hello and our order was taken right away. Then it started to go down hill from there. We ordered a basic waffle cone with a  scoop of black cherry ice cream,  a Captains Breakfast, and a bottle of water.  It was a little less than $20.  As we waited for our ice cream, we looked around and took a few pictures. After 15 minutes we still had no ice cream and the only two employees working were both at the register trying to help the same customer. It looked like a computer issue. Those people ended up leaving and one girl started to make the ice cream while the other employee helped get the line down. I will say the concept is so cool, the nitrogen making the gusts looks awesome and I can see my kids getting s kick out of that, I liked that I was able to watch the entire process including her making my waffle cone in the waffle iron. After 20 minutes we finally had our ice cream and the girl was very apologetic for the time it took. Which I really appreciated. The ice cream was very good. The flavor was great. The downside it was already dripping down my hands before I even got out the door. By the time I got to my car which was super close it was all over me. I couldn't eat it fast enough. I ended up having to stop and get more napkins and had to throw it away. I was bummed. My daughters Captains Breakfast melted just as fast, but was in a cup. She said it was good, but very sweet, and turned out to be more of a soggy cereal mixture, and again had to throw it away. Basically we paid $20 for water. I can't see myself going again unless it was to sit inside and see if that helps, but as I said it was already dripping down my hand before we got out the door into the summer heat. We drove all the way from Surprise to check it out and left feeling meh. Throwing away ice cream felt like a punishment. Bummer.
