I was expecting a lot less based on these reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. The meal itself definitely stemmed from a vision of fusion cuisine - a twist on classic dishes to keep things interesting. And overall, as a group of 4 girls who visited on a Tuesday evening, it worked for us, and we didn't find the food too bad at all.\n\nLocated right by Spadina Road and Dundas Street West (and not too far away from Kensington Market), we opted for the \"Go All In\" menu package (good for 4 guests), which includes 3 snacks and 3 large plates (which also came with rice, eggs, and soup) for $115. We had the soy sauce eggs, crispy chicken skins, kaffir broccoli tempura, jackpot chicken, fire-roasted chicken, schmaltzy rice, among other dishes (yes... we were hungry lol).\n\nOverall, we actually quite enjoyed the schmaltzy rice and the snacks that came with our meal. The rice seems to be cooked in a chicken stock or something similar because it was super flavourful without being soggy. The actual chicken itself was fine but wasn't my favourite - it was a little too moist for me to enjoy. However, while the chicken wasn't the best, everything else was quite tasty (although, for a restaurant called Jackpot CHICKEN, you'd think the chicken would be the highlight - but it wasn't).\n\nNot a bad spot for a group dinner or casual date - atmosphere is colourful and quirky, and the music was 90's hip hop in the best way possible. We would come back here again!
