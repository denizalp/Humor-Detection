Dear Bobby Flay , \nI want to meet you and every time I gone to Mesa, I always ask your staff if you're in back of the kitchen! I had a dream that you and I were barbecuing for our friends and family. One day Bobby we will bbq together! I bet my bbq is bettter than yous!!\n\nYou'll always be my #1 chef!\n\nMelody\n\nSo as for the restaurant! I super love their food, the flavor, it's well cooked, and it has a Nice ambiance..  I tried different entree, Love all of them Salmon, Shrimp tamale (sounds weird right) but its so good, rib-eye, has a good flavor. Love their chorizo tamale and salmon\/tuna fish tartar  with banana chips so good, wish they put more on the plate.\n\nWill I go again? Of course, every chance that I get!!\nMUST try it, promise you wont get disappointed!!
