As with the other negative review, we have multiple problems with management or the lack of basic real property management activities. I'll provide a list of the issues and the final one today and on Black Friday that have tipped the scales.\n\n1) we had to correct the quoted amounts on the lease 2 times for the agent. \n2) they left off one of our two dogs on the lease and acted surprised when they realized we had two. Someone didn't do their paperwork right... again\n3) false claims of dog park additions (discounted by Brooke the area manager ) lies !\n4)had to resign the lease 3-4 times for their errors.\n5)dog park never cleaned \n6)dog park always flooded and then sending nasty grams to residents about using the lawn as directed by Erica.\n7) property telling us it was our responsibility to clean up other dog owners mess and \/ or hold them accountable. Isn't that what they're being paid $2100 a month for and the pet rent \n8) refusal to supply poop bags in the dog park \n9) forgot to put our extra parking space in the leasing system. Double rented it and proceeded to put multiple stickers on our car resulting in additional cleaning expenses they eventually took care of after gripping for months. Not to mention waking us up on a Sunday because our car was about to be towed for their mistake.\n10) Erica refusing to meet with me over the car spot mess\n11) Erica finally meets to go over the deficiencies\n12) Erica and Assistant community manager refusing on 4 occasions to provide their supervisors contact info as an escalation ( violation of Arizona law) \n13) missing mail and had told us to go ahead and forward our mail before move in only to find out they didn't remove the mailbox card saying the place was vacant so all our mail was returned. Still catching up with bills we were missing from this\n14) assistant community manager threatening us with legal action over an AUM bill that was 13 days late for $50 bucks that was paid to the utility company via bill pay but was kicked back. \n15)hot tub always broke, Erica says it's the residents fault. Actually it's a complex \/ design problem if you really want a root cause analysis.\n16) management failure to communicate and close the loop.\n17) late in paying our referral. \n18) started retaliation for the complaints and escalations \n19) attempted to perform scare tactics and essentially a constructive eviction which was illegal and wouldn't hold water in court to which the area manager quickly rescinded. Photo attached.\n20) they filed a report with the police station and sent officers to my house while my partner and I were away from the apartment supposedly because an \"anonymous resident \" reported Marijuana smell at my unit. They didn't report it in the vicinity, they reported our apartment in a hall of 12 units. Called the cops and they closed the case as an unsubstantiated claim and advised me to file a complaint against the complex for filing a false police report. Public record. Look it up. Black Friday 2017, unit 3076 at the complex address. Cops responded and report says \"no smell evident in the hallway or vicinity of my apartment\". We don't smoke and the complex doesn't allow medical marijuana. Don't smoke if you come here. They'll try to put you out for irrevocable repair and breach of the lease. They tried to circumvent the 48 hour notice for maintenance \/ inspection by sending the cops to our door for this unsubstantiated claim and we're trying to \"catch us\" but they got dirt in their face because the cops couldn't substantiate it and we were away when the smell was reported.\n21) attempting to back peddle again from the police incident and put notices on the doors in our hall with claims that don't match the police report . Attached photo. \n\n23)my favorite, today I went to give her 3 verbal notices to cease and desist for breach of the lease, harassment and a personal cease and desist to Erica for her continued retaliation. She erupted at me in front of her staff,  completely flew off the handle. Was screaming and yelling at me playing like she was the victim called me a \"bully.\" She rapidly approached me from behind her desk, exited her office and violated my personal space while pointing her finger a foot from my face and was screaming at the top of her lungs that I was no longer welcome and no longer welcome in the office ?  Mind you this is all on camera and two of her staff members were present for this. What a shining example of how to put that required training to work!  A waste of time for shutting the place down to retrain everyone.\n\nGood luck and happy home finding.
