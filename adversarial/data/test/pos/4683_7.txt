I just had the worst customer service experience of my life at this store, from the manager himself. First of all, I am disappointed every time I go into the store because they never have the nutrition I'm looking for. The selection is really minimal for GUs, shot blocks and the like. However, I look past that and continue to shop there for apparel needs. On my last visit I purchased a running singlet that was on sale for my husband. Since it looked a little big I made it a point to ask the sales associate if I could return it. I figured she would say no since the item was on sale, but she said I could in fact bring it back, no problem, if it didn't fit my husband right. So today I stopped by to return it and was told something completely different by another associate. At first she told me I couldn't return it, then she told me I could exchange it for another tank. I went over to look and there weren't many options to choose from, so I asked for clarification. I asked if I could exchange it for any other tank top. She said no, that it needed to be a men's tank top similar to the original one I purchased. So I went back and tried to look again. Still unhappy with my choices, I returned to the counter to see if there was anyway I could exchange it for anything else, happily willing to spend more money in order to get something I actually wanted. This time the manager rushed over to me to say in a very stern manner that the only thing I could exchange it for was again, a men's tank top that was just like the one I purchased. So this time, since it was the manager, I asked why the previous associate specifically told me I could bring it back yet he was telling me something totally different. He raised his voice and started talking over me to tell me that the associate would not have said I could return it and that he didn't understand why he had to keep explaining that to me. I didn't need any further explanation on the matter, I simply hoped that since I was unhappy with this purchase he would allow me to exchange it for something better in the store. Instead all he wanted to do was talk down to me in a very rude, condescending manner. As a former retail manager, I was overwhelmingly dissatisfied with this experience so I walked over to him before I left to let him know that that is not the way you should treat a customer. I understand that stores have policies in place for returns & exchanges. I was not loud or angry in any manner so there was no reason for him to get such an attitude with me over the exchange of a sale tank top. He flat out did not care that I was upset by his customer service and continued to be rude, never once showing any kind of empathy. \n\nThis is simply not the way you run a business. This store needs a manager that cares about good customer service and treats the customers right. I wasn't asking him to return the item. I simply wanted to exchange this brand new tank top with tags still on it and all for something that fit right. Given that the options were so limited it should not have been an issue for me to get something better, and spend more money as a result!  But apparently this store manager is more concerned with standing his ground than making the situation right for a customer. \n\nI hate it for this business because the store has so much potential. On my last visit I walked in to buy a few GUs and left spending over $100 because of the nice, helpful sales associate. I run a ton of miles and spend an awful lot on running shoes and clothes but I will never return to this store because of this rude store manager. I will take my business to another running store that values their business and treats customers the way they deserve to be treated. I will encourage all of my running friends to do the same.
