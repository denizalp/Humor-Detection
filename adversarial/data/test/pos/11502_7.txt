We walked in and were seated right away. I wanted to order reshmi kabob but the waiter insisted (very strongly) that we should order the fried fish. So we ordered the fish, chicken karhai, and lamb karhai. My husband, who eats only boneless chicken, ordered the chicken karhai because they didn't have the chicken tikka n masala. The waiter said that the chicken karhai is boneless, so we ordered that instead. The fish was good when the rest of the food arrived, we realized the chicken wasn't boneless. Since no one was around, except a child sitting at the register, we decided to just eat it. A bit later, we asked the waiter\/cook fora 4th naan...which never came. So I decided not to eat the rest of my lamb karhai, which had a very stale strong smell. Then we wanted to order the shahi tukrey, which I was very excited about, but they only had kheer. He got us an order of kheer ( with his finger dipping into the plate when he put it on the table). Kheer was good. We go to the register where he asked us what we ordered. We mentioned 3 naans and he said oh you ordered 4 naans but ill charge for only 3. I was so upset by then I didn't even want to argue. If there were other desi halal restaurant open at that hour I would have left. Horrible experience. I understand that this is an inexpensive restaurant but you should get what you order in a clean manner.
