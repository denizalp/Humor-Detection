So I will upgrade my review of the store just because the store itself is kinda cool and fun to browse through. I still havent broke down and bought an iPhone or iPad, but maybe, just maybe sometime soon. Although I'm still waiting for the big announcement of the iPlug 5g cerebral cortex implant with internal cornea heads up display. Come on Steve, get on it, I really hate having to use my hands when I talk or text.
