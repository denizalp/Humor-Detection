Came in on a weekday and was seated asap BC it wasn't that busy. The interior is nicely decorated and my waiter suggested the Linguine Pescatore since I was craving seafood.\n\nMy entree included salad which was fresh and chilled. When my Linguine  Pescatore arrived I was shocked at the size and all the scallops, shrimps, clams, mussels and calamari the entree included. The red sauce was not overpowering and I could really taste the melody of seafood ingredients.\n\nMy waiters was friendly and knowable with his menu offerings. Only negative was I was I was full and couldn't order any dessert!
