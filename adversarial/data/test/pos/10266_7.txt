I should start by saying that this is where I did my undergrad....\n\nRyerson was a great school.  I love that it's literally smack in the middle of downtown Toronto.  You don't get that campus life you see on Hallmark movies, but you do get an incredible variety of people -  cultures, ages and departments.\n\nThe school provides the students with real life learning and prepares them for what the working world will be like in their industry.  From the professors to the curriculum, they have a great team.\n\nGo Rams
