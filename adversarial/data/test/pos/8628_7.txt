I have been meaning to try this place for a while. Today I got that chance and this was so mediocre and blah I would have been better off going to McDonald's for a better value and not have to tip a waitress who reminded me of a robot. First off there was enough salt in this food to start my own Salton sea. My measure of how the rest of food is at a new restaurant is the Eggs Benedict so I always try that first...big pet peeve alert....why do restaurants insist on serving crappy powder mix hollandaise ..IT SUCKS.....is it so hard to put in some extra effort to make homemade sauce?..the seasoned potatoes tasted like they were put on a conveyor belt of salt and run thru like 20 times...i paid 2.45 for coffee..and 3.75 for an oj...total rip off..im tired of mediocre crap being pawned off on the public in order to keep the owners of these places from losing money. the waitress was going thru the motions dropped my check before i was even finished,did not ask if i wanted a warm up on my coffee nor a to go cup for my Starbucks costing java...The verdict is more crap service and food for 21 dollars..at least McDonald's is consistent....after i ate this garbage i had to find a bathroom quickly as I got an instant irritable bowel reaction...such a pleasant way to start the day....me thinks not!!
