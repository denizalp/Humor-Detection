This was once my favorite AYCE sushi place.  The always packed and long waiting times for a seat was proof that I was not alone with my experience.   It pains me to say though that for the last 3-4 times we've dined here it has been disappointing.  There seems to be a big turnaround with staff, so maybe there is a training issue?    But having Sushi here is just not the same.  The pieces are so inconsistent the cuts are small the cuts are big the nigiri and rolls are sloppy, the rice is hard, the rice is over and so on.  This sounds like a goldilocks story lately, except there is no \"just right\" to follow, sorry.  \n\nAnother concern and somewhat uncomfortable issue here is the conversations taking place from the staff behind the sushi bar.  They don't have time to engage with the customer, but they can comment on every person mainly girls coming through the door.  I have heard so many unnecessary comments and extra talk that just has no place in the workplace and worse, does nothing to add to a positive dining experience.   \n\nAlso I thought the electronic waitlist system controlled by the host was pretty clever at first, until a couple of times the host apologize for accidently calling us or forgetting us all together.  This system needs to be improved also.\n\nSome things are surly lacking here and I really hope they revisit some of the things that made coming here, an enjoyable and worth the wait experience; otherwise all the steady competition out there and plenty of AYCE choices will continue to irasshaimase me.
