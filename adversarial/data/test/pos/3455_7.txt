This place is a typical airport Mexican place.  The food is Meh and they mainly serve drinks.  The server was very friendly and that was one of the things I liked about it most.  I was thinking about giving this place a two star due to the good server, however there is one thing that stuck out in a significant way.  There are no plugs in this place.  They have a whole bar area and bar top area along the perimeter and not a single plug to plug any device in.  I take that back.  I saw one plug.  I would not be surprised by thing five years ago, however it todays time you need to have power in an airport.  People can't travel without it and most places are at the minimum retrofitting power strips into the high bar tops areas.  Get with today and install some power so people can be productive during their multiple hour flight delays.  That is all I have to say.  Get plugs.
