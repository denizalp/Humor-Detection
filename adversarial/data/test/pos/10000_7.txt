Came to Bistro 990 under my friend's recommendation. Restaurant to the stars apparently....\n\nThe ambiance is very intimate. We ordered the Foie Gras de Canard and the Bistro Cesar salad to start....\n\nI ordered a Lychee Martini as a beverage. The orange slice that came with it was unimpressive as it wasn't sweet but then again perhaps oranges are not in season. The martini itself was perfectly balanced, full flavored, not too dry, not too sweet - just right.  \n\nOn to the bread. It's made in-house but it loses points because it was not warm. The bread was nice and crusty on the outside and soft in the centre. I'm sure it would've been wonderful if it was warm. The butter was creamy and perfectly spreadable.  There was a French baguette as well as olive bread. The baguette was not salted evenly as I got a big salt overdose from the fleur de sel on one part of the bread. The olive bread was divine.\n\nOn to the foie gras. It was served atop apples and a canap√© with a pear jus. The foie gras was seared on the outside and very creamy in the centre. Melt in your mouth goodness!  The apples were a little tart for my liking and the bread was too crunchy. I would've enjoyed a sweeter fruit accompaniment such as a currant or berry.\n\nThe salad came with crisp romaine leaves.... Loved the crunch! The dressing was just creamy goodness. I found the pancetta a little dry and too salty for my liking.\n\nWe ordered the wild game of the day which was Wild Boar. It was served with a celeriac remoulade, beets and a beet jus. I think wild boar, being a leaner cut of meat, resulted in a not-so-tender pork, but it was definitely not lacking in flavor.  The celeriac remoulade was velvety smooth with a hint of licorice flavor to it. I couldn't get enough!\n\nI would also like to add that we got all these dishes to share. Save for dessert and the foie gras, they brought it to us in separate plates which was nice as it felt like we got our own individual servings! \n\nTo finish off for dessert we got the carrot cake which came with raisins and pecan ice cream. I think the dish could've done without the pecan ice cream as it was bland and didn't really do anything to enhance the dish. The raisins were a great accompaniment and complemented the cake well. The carrot cake itself was well-executed and moist. We also got the Baked Alaska and the meringue was to die for! Very smooth and creamy! I also ordered a cappuccino which I wish was less foam and more coffee because it was really good!  My DC got a coffee but it was nothing special.\n\nAll in all a good dining experience. Our bill came up to $130 for 2 people but it was money well-spent. The service was satisfactory but not spectacular. The waitress was very sweet. My DC was curious if the foie was goose or duck and the waitress said they actually serve goose liver that comes from a local farm from Northern Ontario. So either their menu is misprinted or the waitress is just bluffing as the last time I checked foie gras de CANARD means DUCK liver and foie d'OIE means goose liver.\n\nNB. The washrooms are on the second floor, and if you have had one too many drinks, you may want someone to accompany you to the bathroom (more so for the trip back down the stairs than anything else).  The lighting is very dim, and the stairs are pretty steep.  When we walked into the restaurant, the bar is the first thing you see, and a girl screamed \"OMG, Joachim?\" to my dining companion.  It was quite hilarious.  My DC said \"Joachim, Tom Cruise, I get that a lot...\" We got a good laugh.  SHE would've been someone who would've been wise to get a bathroom pal because my DC was Chinese, and the last time I checked Joachim wasn't :P
