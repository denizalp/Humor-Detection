Uhhhhh, I once spent 6 hours on a Saturday afternoon here and I have no regrets. I ate food, drank out of a fancy glass bowl, sang karaoke (Shoop is my jam, if you're interested), and bowled my heart out, until it was time to have more drinks at the bar before suddenly realizing, \"damn, have I really been here for six hours?\" YEAH I HAD. \n\nPBS is so fun! I wouldn't stroll in on a Saturday evening expecting to do all the things I mentioned above without a long wait, but Saturday afternoon? You got it. The cost for each activity really isn't too high (I don't think, at least) and they have so much to do. Bowl, karaoke, billiards, darts, other games that I don't really care about... they have those too. The servers were all awesome, checked on us often, and were polite given the drunkenness of our group. I did dock a star because overall, I wasn't a huge fan of their food and we tried a lot. The wing marinade was a bit much and forgettable - too sweet. The pimiento cheese was tasty, but the amount of bread triangles didn't fit the ratio so we had to ask for more twice. The french fries were good, but how often do you meet a fried potato that doesn't taste delicious slathered in ketchup? Rarely. \n\nAnyways, Saturday or Sunday afternoons are where it's at. So much fun and can't wait to find an excuse to waste another 6 hours of my weekend here!
