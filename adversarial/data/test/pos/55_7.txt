Worst customer service experience I have ever had. I had a driver shaft replaced and after using it for the first time at the driving range, the shaft cracked where they had connected the new shaft to the driver head.  They refused to acknowledge that they had done poor work, refused to help replace it without buying a whole new shaft and then ignored me while I asked for alternative ideas.  The women at the front counter was also very rude and accused me of stealing the broken club that she saw me bring in.
