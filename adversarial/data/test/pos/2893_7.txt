This place used to be our regular haunt but now we find ourselves going to other of the many burger options in the area instead. \n\nWhy?  On our recent visits the burgers arrived lukewarm and dry while the fries were greasy and soggy.  Their milkshakes have remained constantly good though. \n\nWe do appreciate the interesting twist to your typical hamburger but the meat pattie could use a little revamping.
