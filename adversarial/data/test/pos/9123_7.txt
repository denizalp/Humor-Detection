The Las Vegas skyline is populated with mega-structures designed to dazzle the eye.  The Paris Resort is no exception.  To enter, you drive under a fifty foot Arc de Triomphe.  The valets are dressed in stereotypical Parisian stripes, and you must cross under the humongous foot of La Tour Eiffel inside the casino to get to Gordon Ramsay Steak.\n\nIn keeping with the subtle details of Las Vegas design, you must pass through the Chunnel designed to transport guests from Paris to the United Kingdom.  This metaphorical journey is subtle but the massive fifty foot Union Jack on the ceiling is anything but.  There can be no doubt that you have arrived at Ramsay's place.  The hustle and bustle of smoothly functioning kitchen and wait staff permeates the room while guests seems quietly in awe of the house built by America's hottest TV chef.\n\nThe booths in the upstairs balcony provide a sense of privacy, but the myriad of servers quickly keep you from feeling neglected.  A server's assistant places an interactive iPad on the table and teaches us how to navigate through the digital menu.  There is also, some interesting background data on Chef Gordon.  Our waiter, Yaron, was explaining the menu and its multitude of options, when he drops the ultimate bomb on our table; \"we also have an exclusive chef's tasting menu for a limited time\".  Done, we are now treated to five courses of culinary bliss complete with wine pairings and dessert.\n\nThere were moments when you could see Chef Gordon's classical training, there were moments when you could see the quasi-arrogant TV personality showing off and there were times when you felt like the Scot from Stratford England was just a bloke looking to feed his mates from down the pub.\n\nChef's mastery of the preparation of beets with pumpernickel soil was a lesson in culinary flavor and texture teamwork.  The world famous Wellington beef was prepared to perfection; of course.  However, when we read that fish and chips were next on our pairing meal we couldn't quite wrap our minds around it.  I made the snide comment \"it better come with a pint\" while quietly trying to figure out what wine would accompany fish and chips.  When the aesthetically appealing plates hit the table the sommelier was right around the corner with glasses and a bottle of Fin du Monde Ale.  Chef Ramsay was dazzling our minds and our mouths while remaining true to his roots.  \n\nThis chef's menu was not cheap, coming in at $170 per person (with wine pairings).  However, if having a culinary experience with a mastermind as your guide isn't enough to give you the celebrity experience, you also get an autographed photo of the TV star himself.\n\nThe experience is one that you should not miss out on during your trip to Vegas.  As for locals like myself, we now have a new restaurant to call home for every visitor that comes to Vegas.
