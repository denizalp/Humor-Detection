Shake Shack is nearly unrivaled in taste and quality at its price point and the east coast's answer to my beloved In N Out. Yes, I said it - In N Out.\n\nI adore a properly made cheeseburger. It is one of the things that makes life so cherished and beautifulâ€‹. Being from SoCal, I have been spoiled as both In N Out and The Habit is readily available and now I have an east coast equivalent in Shake Shack. Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Inland Empire please be advised that the Double Shackburger is the TRUTH. The dual 100% Angus beef topped with melting cheese, crisp lettuce, tomato slices and \"ShackSauce\" made me emotional with every bite. I loved this burger. \n\nThe hand cut fries were no laughing matter either, a perfect shade of golden brown with a mouthfeel that would make angels weep. I like mine with yellow mustard and they delivered in spades. The chocolate custard was thick, smooth and packed more chocolate-y funk than a 360 dunk. I usually dislike sweets, not the case that fateful day.\n\nShake Shack is the business people. The hot dog is also very good - if not entirely exceptional - but to even mention the hot dog after the burger is akin to asking a hooker for a hug. The only caveat emptor is that the lines can be outrageous, but an In N Out fanatic wouldn't bat an eye and they move the crowds pretty efficiently.\n\nI would love to have a Double Shackburger right about... now.
