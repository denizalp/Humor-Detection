This is a happy hour review! Prices listed below are happy hour prices as of 4\/29\/15.\n\nThe Skinny: excited to try their happy hour menu items and they are all pretty good albeit not without flaws(3.75) service is prompt and efficient at the bar(4) value: portion sizes are very generous for a happy hour menu and the food is solid for the most part. Service was good at the bar. (3.75 bump up to 4 starred review) \n\nFYI -  signage is poor in Caesar's Palace so it is hard to find.  Searsucker is tucked away close to the sportsbook and next to the Omnia dance club. \n\nWe were totally jived to try out Searsucker's happy hour menu. We got duck fat fries ($4), the farm bird lollipops, the Caesar salad, the Strawberry\/goat cheese\/walnut salad ($6 each),  the tuna tartare,  the squid ($8 each), the crab cake and the short rib ($10 each). We were slightly disappointed that the burger on the online happy hour menu was gone but with their sizable menu,  this was easily overlooked. We were surprised but the serving size was very generous for each of these dishes especially the aforementioned $10 items and the two salads. We probably won't order that much again knowing how big the servings are. \n\nHere is the run down:\n\nDuck fat fries with tomato jam ($4): satisfying with a nice smokey flavor from the tomato jam. The hubs would have preferred a slightly crisper texture but I found them to be pretty good in that regard. Would order again. \n\nFarmbird lollipops + hot sauce + Bleu ($6): these were more like chicken meatballs on a skewer. The flavor wasn't really hot per se. It tasted more like sweet and sour rather than hot sauce like -  kind of like Swedish meatballs. The Bleu cheese flavor was rather muted. Overall, this dish was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Pass on this. \n\nStrawberry + champagne + goat cheese + walnuts ($6): get this! Delicious and lightly dressed,  the flavors married beautifully together. Protip: the goat cheese is adhered to on the bottom of the plate so make sure you give a good scrape before you dig in. Portion size is generous and could easily make 2 side salads. \n\n\"Caesar\" romaine + kale + egg + parm ($6): okay Caesar. Honestly, the dressing did not have that  garlicky, fishy (from anchovies) punch and missed that hit of acidity in the end. The dressing was a bit too salty as well. Serving size again was very generous and could easily stand in as a light meal on its own. Would pass and get an extra strawberry\/goat cheese salad instead. \n\nTuna + radish + taro + spice ($8): pretty good but it is still tuna tartare. The spice is very mild. The tuna was pretty tasty and good quality and worked well with the taro chips. Would order this again depending on the mood.\n\nSquid \"sweet heat\" ($8): the good -  exquisitely tender squid that melts in your mouth, delicious sauces; the bad - dressed too heavily with the Thai chili sweet sauce so we lost the crispness of the fried batter. Overall would be better if both sauces served on the side to maintain the crisp exterior layer. Good dish but needs some refinement -  maybe order again with the sweet chili sauce on the side to see if that changes the dish. \n\nShort rib \"the harlot\" + horseradish + fried onions ($10): very good portion size and easily could be a main entree sized meat portion. Fork tender short rib with a hit of horseradish near the end.  Served over mashed potatoes,  this is a very comforting dish. Personally I thought the gravy could use a little more acidity but that I think is more personal taste. The hubs wolfed this dish down. Would recommend. \n\nCrab cake jumbo lump + fennel + airlines ($10): if you like crab,  you will like this. Lots of crab meat in chunks with minimal filler. A tinge too salty,  it worked well when mixed with the aioli and a good squeeze of lemon. Would order again. \n\nOverall,  our dishes were very good in general and portion sizes for a happy hour menu are very generous. There is enough variety to satisfy most people,  sample some good eats for a reasonable price (for the Strip).  Service was excellent at the bar -  our water glasses were promptly filled and check taken care of quickly. Food arrived swiftly to the table as well. A solid 4 star experience.
