Man, I wanted to be able to say this place doesn't deserve five stars. The waitress really pissed me off. So I'm going to vent about their bullshit and then tell you how they still got five stars.\n\nSo we showed up about thirty minutes before opening and there was still a line of about 6 parties ahead of us. Now We were a group of six and there was one big party ahead of us. The rest were broken up into smaller groups. It was a Saturday so one would figure they'd have enough staffing for the rush.\n\nFast forward to getting seated. The host had seated the large group in their one seating area. A portion of the restaurant was blocked off because apparently they couldn't handle it due to limitations on staff. Pairs were seated in areas that could have easily turned into 4, 6, and 8 tops but because of the odd distribution of parties, there were no tables to combine without moving folks. They split us into a party of four and two. We did say that was okay.\n\nWhen we sat, asked the folks at the table next to us if it would be a big deal if we switched our two for the two of them. They were very quick to oblige. It wasn't that long after we sat down that this happened, we hadn't even ordered.\n\nSo we called the waitress over who proceeded to chew us out and say that it would be \"too complicated\" for the kitchen and that they wouldn't allow it. \n\nLook, I get it. It doesn't make life easy when people like us do that. We could have just said we would wait longer for a large table (it would have been an additional 20-30 minutes based off of how long the big table moved out). What pissed me off was the rudeness and the fact that they could have avoided this situation with proper staffing. At a Japanese restaurant no less. I expect more from them.\n\nI think I could just stop my review here. I mean, they pissed me off and I'm still giving FIVE stars. The ramen is that good. It's a hearty, rich tonkotsu broth. The noodles are a little thicker (not Hakata style) and have a nice chewiness to them. Great job on the eggs, the chashu is amazing. Gyoza and fried rice both complimented the ramen. Trust me, it's good.\n\nHere's an insider tip though. As a man who loves miso ramen... order it with butter. It goes really well. But this is my trick. Instead of completely mixing it into the broth, I wrap the butter with the hot noodles. This allows you to have the broth plain to start and then you can pull from the noodles when you want the buttery flavor. As you get further in, it becomes richer.\n\nIt may sound crazy but believe me, it's flippin' delicious.\n\nCheers!
