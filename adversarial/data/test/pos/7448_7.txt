Place was crowded with Chinese people when I visited on Saturday nights.   A good indicator of a good Chinese restaurant.  \n\nFood (8.5\/10) = Dishes I've tried (all from the Sichuan Specialty section of the menu):\n\nAppetizer Section:\n1) Dan Dan Noodles = A dish found on most Sichuan menus.  Classic \"street food\" fare.  A noodle dish with minced meat, with a spicy sesame paste based sauce, topped with chopped green onions +\/- cilantro, and ground Sichuan peppercorns.  This dish is good, but certainly not the best I've had.  \n2) Fu Qi Fei Pian = the English translation of this dish doesn't sound appetizing.  But it's certainly a Sichuan specialty, and one of the dishes I use to judge a Sichuan restaurant.  The dish is served cold and composed of thin slices of various parts of the cow (beef, tripe, tongue, etc.).  The meat is marinated with a spicy oil based sauce, topped with ground Sichuan peppercorns and chopped cilantro.  A great appetizer to try.  Again, the dish is good, but not the best 'fu qi fei pian' I've had in North America.\n\nVegetable Section:\n1) Tu Dou Si = Essentially stir-fried julienned potato.  The dish is done well by the How Lee chefs.  Potatoes are cooked, but still slightly crisp and not soggy.\n2) Yu Xiang Qie Zi = look at the picture I posted.  Look how beautiful the eggplant looks.  The glistening purple skin of this fine vegetable.  The sauce is slightly sweet and slightly spicy.  The eggplant is not overdone to the soggy mush texture that sometimes happens at some Chinese restaurants.\n3) Kong Xin Cai = Chinese water spinach, or literally 'hollow heart vegetable.'  One of my favorite vegetable dishes to eat.  Lightly stir-fried with green onions and garlic.  Maybe a little ginger?  A clean crisp dish.  It's the vegetable's texture that is unique.  The crunch of biting into a vegetable straw.\n\nSeafood Section:\n1) Shui Zhu Yu Pian = This dish is done very well by the chefs of How Lee.  The fish slices are incredibly tender.  The spicy broth that these fish slices swim in is spicy...the level of spiciness where you start sweating.  The glorious physiologic reaction to Sichuan food, while your tongue is numbed out by the Sichuan peppercorns.  Again, the fish slices are big and impressively tender.  At the bottom of the shallow bowl, sits a bed of Napa cabbage.  Sprigs of cilantro sit on top of the dish.  Warning, don't drink the broth, unless you strangely enjoy extracurricular activities such as dropping fireball bombs into porcelain the next morning.\n\nMeat Section:\n1) ChongQing La Zi Ji = Chongqing style spicy diced chicken.  Little pieces of diced fried chicken.  It's crispy.  Finished in the wok with red chili peppers, garlic, and sesame seeds.  I can't decide if this is my favorite How Lee dish or the Shui Zu Yu Pian.  Despite how approx 35% of the dish is composed of red chili peppers, the spiciness is not overwhelming.  It' just enough to give each morsel of fried chicken a kick of heat.    \n\nAmbiance (7.5\/10) = Cozy and clean.  Situated at the corner of Shady Ave and Forbes.  The decor is what I expect of most Chinese restaurants.\n\nService (7.5\/10) = service is fast.  food comes out fast.  \n\nOverall opinion = Haven't decided if this is the best Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their menu includes the typical \"American\" Chinese food, but the real gem is the Sichuan menu in the back.  While some of the dishes I've tried were not the best in North America, overall the food is very delicious.  As I've mentioned in other reviews of Pittsburgh Asian restaurants, the prices are higher than what you would find in other cities with a Chinatown or a huge Asian population.  If you've never been to How Lee, I highly recommend trying the Chongqing La Zi Ji and Shui Zhu Yu Pian.
