The workers here are paid to just wear the IKEA uniform and to tell your kids not jump on the beds.\n\nIt's ALL self service. From start to end. \n\nIKEA is the Volkswagen of furniture. Certain folks are attracted by the European allure and low prices but eventually they find out it's all cheaply made, Chinese manufactured with a kinky Euro name, particle board, disposable college furniture. \n\nShit, I liked IKEA when it was new back in the day. I was in my 20's, making less than 20 grand a year and loved the chic Euro styles to adorn my college apartment. Today, I know a little better, make a little more... but there are always new suckers who will buy into this stuff. \n\nGo check your Craigslist. There's bound to be some old IKEA furniture someone's trying to get rid of.\n\nTry not to hurt your back when you load that 300 lb cardboard box into the back of your SUV. \n\nDon't bother, there's nobody here to help you. Even at check out, you do it all yourself.\n\nAt the cafeteria, you might was well roll your own Swedish meatballs. \n\nAt IKEA, you're left alone.
