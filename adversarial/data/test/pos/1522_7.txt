Vacationing in Arizona and just stopped in to ABC for a quick dessert & coffee after a long day on the road.  Of course,  we had seen the KN episode, and were anxious to see the place.  What a pleasant surprise!  Sammy was truly gracious and helpful, and Amy came out of the kitchen to chat.  It was afternoon between meal services and they couldn't have been nicer.  We had excellent coffee, delicious desserts, and a great experience.  Only gave it 4 stars because we didn't have a meal....but I would definitely be back to try it again!
