This place gets some bad reviews, and I don't understand why. Obviously, they are successful or they wouldn't be opening up a SECOND and NEW location nearby on McDowell Road!! \n\nI have been going to Manny's for many years. I love their chicken enchiladas with the cream sauce, their cheese enchiladas with red sauce, their tacos, rice and beans and fajitas! They serve good chips and salsa!\n\nSo, my advice is to ignore the negative complainers and give it a try!!
