They really went beyond my expecations this time. I had a package to return via UPS, and had already printed out and attached my return label. All that I needed to do was to drop it off at a UPS store. \n\nI ran in to the store, thinking that I would just hand the package to the clerk and be on my way. Not at all. The clerk took the package, checked it in and then printed out a receipt with the tracking number so that I would have a record of it. This was a nice touch.\n\nI had come to this location a while back to ship an item, but did not have a box. I was able to choose a box, and they then packed and shipped my item right away.
