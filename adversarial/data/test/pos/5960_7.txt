We just had a very nice stay at Trump, thanks to Priceline.  I confess we got this hotel due to an error in bidding on my part.  I accidentally added in the North Condo zone, and had an absolute hissy fit when I realized what I had done.   That being said there are some real pluses to staying here, and the price for a 5-star was pretty darn good, especially since it included a Saturday night. \n\n   Plus 1:  Much easier for a cab driver to get there and drop you off than a strip hotel.  We arrived on a very busy Saturday and the cab line looked like a popular Disney World ride queue.  Traffic was busy, yet we arrived quickly.\n   Plus 2:  Fast fast fast check-in.  NO wait at a prime afternoon check-in time. Friendly too, with no snooty attitude that one can sometimes encounter when checking in prepaid via Priceline.\n   Plus 3:  EASY, SHORT walk to your room.  A rarity in Vegas.  Save the miles for strip-walking.  (we sure did plenty of that, so being able to quickly get to our room when we got back each day was nice!)\n   Plus 4:  Rooms are two per suite area, so you have the added security of an extra door.\n  Plus  5:  JACUZZI.  Not just a boring big tub.  (let bubble bath search commence...but remember to only use a TEENY bit). \n  Plus 6:   Fridge (and other kitchen things that would only be a plus imho if we were staying longer than 3 nights).  \n  Plus7:  Buttons by door that you can use to indicate privacy or housekeeping.  Very classy and worked like a charm.\n  Plus 8:  Room service.  Top-notch.  Friendly.  Quick.  And surprisingly less expensive than I've seen in hotels in Vegas and other cities. We ordered a burger one night and it was good, with waffle fries, came with cute little bottles of mustard, ketchup and a teeny tiny Tabasco!  We had them bring up a corkscrew also, which we were surprised wasn't already in the room. \n  Plus 9:  Courtesy Shuttle.  We NEVER had to wait more than 2 minutes for it.  Drivers were very friendly.  Took us to either the Encore or a very convenient location at the Forum Shoppes.  (underground, with an escalator that comes out right in front of Spago). Never ever had such quick, friendly shuttle service at a hotel anywhere before!\n  Plus 10:  Location isn't bad anyway.  Cross the street (be careful) and you are in the Fashion Mall  and on your way to wherever you want to go.  Note that there is an ABC store in the mall that has wine, munchies, sparkling water...pretty much anything you might need. Also note that when you come out of the mall on Las Vegas Blvd, that is where the Tix 4 Tonite booth is so you can see if you want any discount tix or meal discounts.  We bought Absinthe tix there, saved money on it, and the show was very entertaining!\n   Plus 11:  Housekeeping...excellent!  Bless their hearts (see minuses 2-10 below)\n  \n  Minus 1:  No robes in room.  (easily rectified by a call to the front desk, also had extra towels brought up in anticipation of jacuzzi usage).\n  Minus 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:  The TOILET.  We HATED this toilet.  You can't tell me that Donald Trump or anyone in his family have ever used this toilet or one like it.  Heck our old ones here at home are considerably better.  It was the WORST toilet we have EVER had to deal with.  Now even though it was supposed to be Trump opulence, we didn't expect a golden throne or anything, but this porcelain puny had a plastic lid (no big deal, but unexpected in a 5-star).... the PROBLEM was that it would barely flush.  I realize the idea is to save energy, water, etc., but how much of a savings is it when you have to flush 3 times (waiting in between each time for the tank to fill up)?  Not only was the suckage power non-existent, but there was no water that would go around the basin, making flushing fairly useless, beyond frustrating and flat-out embarrassing at times.  God help Housekeeping here!  (Hope everyone believes in tipping Housekeeping like we do). \n  Minus 11:  The view. If you get \"city view\" like we did, it means a view of the Erotic Heritage Museum (which doesn't seem to get any traffic), and other such lovely landmarks.  Not a biggie to us as we didn't spend much time in the room, but if it's important to you ask for a different view.  \n  Minus 12:  The train.  I'm only putting this as a minus because I know it would bother a lot of folks.  To us having spent a year and a half dealing with downtown DC noises, it was no big deal.  But yes it would wake us up several times each night.\n\n   Overall impressions...this hotel feels more like 4 stars than 5. Whereas service was definitely 5-star in all regards (front desk, housekeeping, shuttle drivers, room service, security guard in lobby)... furniture, bedding, etc. was more 4-star than 5.  Toilet alone makes it impossible to rate it a 5.  It feels like a 4-star hotel that could be in any city anywhere.  There's nothing that cries out VEGAS RESORT.  And THAT is a plus or minus depending on how you look at it.
