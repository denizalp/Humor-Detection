Gorgeous casino, d√©cor scheme seems to be taken from the Bellagio gardens- good mix of stores, restaurants, and gaming. Really appreciate how spacious this casino is, lots of space to walk around without cramming slot machines into every available nook.\n\nService is typically very top notch, and restaurants on site are known for being able to accommodate any dietary restriction and have several vegan, vegetarian, and vegetable-laden options at each.\n\nParking garage is smaller than most but easily accessible, casino itself is on the smaller side but more intimate and upscale rather than crowded and gaudy.
