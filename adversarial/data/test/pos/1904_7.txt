I didn't know this little Japanese store was in my neighborhood, but finally noticed the sign when I was driving by one day.  I stopped in looking for green tea Kit Kats for a birthday gift, but the nice lady working there said they were out until the end of the month.  I did find a few Hello Kitty items and got to look around.  In addition to items like ramen, curry sauces, slippers, Pocky, mochi, sake, soy sauces, nori, etc., they have a section of the store with Japanese DVDs for rent.  I don't do a lot of Japanese cooking, but if you're in the market for items like these, or green tea Kit Kats, go to Nakata.
