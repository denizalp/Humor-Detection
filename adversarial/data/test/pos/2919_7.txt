A friend of mine booked an all age event here weeks in advance. The moment we arrived  anyone under the age of 21 was refused entry. I just can't figure out why there were so many children running around??!!!! The owner\/ manager at the time couldn't even come to the door herself to let us know why all of a sudden there was an age requirement. Very unprofessional!!!! It is clear we were being discriminated! If your neck is not red, you don't belong here.
