Are You Obese? Do you want to be obese? Do you like getting monstrous portions of slop to eat while looking at other obese people gorge themselves with giant portions of unhealthy food?\n\nWell then Slop House a GoGo is for you. \n\nI read the reviews.\n\nI got personal recommendations. \n\nI have driven by numerous times and have seen all the cars in the parking lot. \n\nAnd now, I have experienced it first hand.\n\nThis place is not for anyone who cares about their health.\n\nWe went there today as I had a hangover and heard this was a place to go to sooth my aching body.\nWell,we got there and were greeted with LOUD music blaring and some not too friendly barstaff that seemed to behave as thought they were doing me a favor getting me a drink.(to bite the dog that bit me)\n\nWe were told the wait would be thirty minutes (which the hostess said was not too bad, often you had to wait for an hour or more for a table), so we sat down after I got my drink. My husband was surfing all of the reviews on Yelp. He asked me two or three times if this is what I wanted because most of the reviews mention the huge portions and the \"Man Vs. Food\" show that this was on. By the way, the wait was not that long.\n\nWell, for those of you who are not acquainted with the show, it is a scourge on America, IMHO. The idea it seems, and I have watched it more than once, is for the host of the show to eat enormous portions of challenging food. I wonder why his liver has not enlarged the way Morgan Spurlock's (of the movie \"SuperSize Me\") did. Probably because he must wait and detoxify between shows. I recommend watching it sometime, it is truly disgusting and an example of Gluttony in the worst way.\nWell, my husband kept giving me hints that the experience may not be what I wanted, since I am interested in quality not quantity, but I was hungover and needed to eat.\n\nWe sat down at a table and noticed that almost every fourth person eating at the tables around us was HUGE. Not just a bit overweight, but hearattack just around the corner fat. I mean people approaching or in fact morbidly obese.\n\nAnd what were they eating? GIANT PILES of DEEP FRIED saucy slop.\n\nMy husband stated once again, that this resturant was on the show \"Man Versus Food\". That is it's claim to fame folks. The show that is suggesting that people should try and eat this HUGE portion of food, when really your stomach is only about the size of your fist.\nWell, onto the meal. \nFirst, I have to say the waitperson was very nice, and that is about all I liked about this place.\nThe food came. We ordered the fried chicken breast benedict and a spinach salad. The spinach salad must have had a half a pound of well cooked, rather tasty bacon on it, but wow, toooo much bacon. And I LOVE bacon. I must say that the salad was tasty.\n\nThe other order was also tasty, but it was ENORMOUS and a giant pile of sadness.\n\nMashed Potatoes, with bacon on top, covered by three deep fried breaded chicken breasts with scrambled eggs and fried cheese on top covered in what must have been a pint of, once again, tasty sauce. Oh, and there were some biscuits strewn about the plate that were the size of two stacked hockey pucks. They were also good.\nBut what they have done, is taken this to an extreme that is just awful. Tone it down a bit, smaller portions, like maybe 10-20% of the size would be fine.\nThe experience was very disheartening, and pretty disgusting. I will only go there as a goof, if I ever go again.\nLose weight America. We have an OBESITY and DIABETES EPIDEMIC.\n\nYou want QUANTITY. Eat here with all the other Fatties.\n\nOh and if you want to just order one thing and share it, they charge you $2.50 for the plate. Sheesh.\n\nYuck.
