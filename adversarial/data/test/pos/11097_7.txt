I don't know why it took so long for Vegas to get creative... I enjoy every bit of the container park more often than not. It's artsy, hip and fun. Deegan has a blast on the playground centered in the middle of the park and there is seating around for parents. I do wish there would be a bit more seating especially on the busier days, but nothing too serious. \n\nThe businesses are a mix of food and some pricey boutiques. Some of my favorites are jinju chocolates, cheffinis, Disney art, the new toy store and new Betty store. We also enjoy the grassy area in front of the stage and the fire shooting mantis that greats you in the front. Some of the store and shops do change because we were told they want to keep things new for people to keep coming back.\n\nThe container Park is something you must enjoy both during the day and at night. At night you get a different feel for things and you can enjoy the park as an adult because they won't let kids in after a certain time. Certified adult time! \n\nThis is a spot we thoroughly enjoy and looking forward to them hopefully one day expanding.
