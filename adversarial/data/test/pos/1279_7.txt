Why would you even bother going to Babu's when Silverspoon is just across the way?\n\nGood quality Pakistani food. Their Biryani is cooked to perfection, each grain of rice separate and al dente.\n\nThe curries, particularly the lamb, are delicious. The only gross thing, is the pool of oil floating over the top. Make it a once in a while treat, and you'll feel okay.\n\nIt's too bad that their Naan isn't made fresh to order. If they worked on that part of their game, they would reign this part of the hood.\n\nService is super, super SLLLLOOOWWW. They definitely need to work on that.\n\nFar better quality and taste than Babu's. Do yourself a service, and cross the plaza!
