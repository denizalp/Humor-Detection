Humiliated, disgusted, and amazed at the lack of professionalism!\nI have stayed at this hotel many times.\nI have always enjoyed the atmosphere and hospitality that I have received in the past. \"In The Past\"\nHyatt has definitely seen a change in its customer satisfaction\nI had an unfortunate incident, and when I requested to speak with the General manager to resolve the issue of several specific charge disputes I was refused. \nOnly after my own research was I able to leave a message for the General Managers assistant. \nI have yet to receive an explanation for charges, an accurate charge, or communication from anyone from this restaurant and Hyatt Hotel. The incident was that there was \"1\" bottle of wine that was misrepresented to myself and guest who unintentionally ordered a bottle of wine for the amount of $545.00 \nNow I can appreciate a good wine, but I was not prepared for this purchase nor was I expecting this charge. To my surprise when I received the bill for $595.00 I requested to speak to the manager. I requested from manager to review the menu with me and to discuss an option for payment as I did not have the immediate means to$595.00 on me at that moment and that I would gladly leave my card and drivers licence with home till morning when I would return with payment. He inexcusably humiliated my guest and I in front of other guest, staff, and each other by making us sit there for an hour and a half before calling the police to have me arrested for theft. I over and over again explained that I was able and willing to pay for the wine I just had to wait for bank to open or for credit card to release funds. \nI showed the manager my checking account which had a balance of $547,563.21\nand that I would gladly pay for the wine that I disputed purchasing in the first place to avoid getting incarcerated by the local police department.\nThe police were very kind and compassionate to the situation while they escorted us from the Hotel.\nThe next morning I reviewed my credit card charges only to find that the Hotel had charged me 14 times in the amount of $1200.00!!!\nNot one charge attempt for $545.00!\nWhen I called and emailed the manager with bank statements and requested his review and to give me a explanation for the charges... Did he respond  No!!\nI travel very frequently, as well as being a member and employee of AAA I would not recommend this establishment.
