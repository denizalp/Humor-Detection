I don't know what I expected, but I was quite underwhelmed by the experience. I came here with my girlfriend and her nieces, and perhaps if her nieces were 7 instead of 13, this would have been a better destination of choice.\nI think one of the surprising things was how expensive it was. Sure, there is no admission fee into the park, but each ticket is just under a dollar and the average ride takes 5 or 6 tickets. So think about that for a second... 6 dollars to ride a log flume down a small ramp once. 6 dollars to drive a bumper boat around for 4 or 5 minutes. 5 dollars for 4 minutes of bumper cars. It adds up faster than the overpriced food selections available.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was the poor excuse of a mini golf course they had. The thing was tiny, dated and run down, and clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while (there were little sticks, leaves, dirt all over the course making it impossible to hit the ball straight). $5 for 9 holes, $9 for 18 holes. After 9 holes we had enough and just said screw it. Most overpriced mini golf I've ever played.\n\nI guess I can say that while it was worth a try, but not a revisit. The highlight was the ferry ride to and from the island, nothing accredited to Centreville Amusement Park.
