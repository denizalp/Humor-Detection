Think twice before you bring your car to this place.  I brought my 2008 Q7 to service a hard starting problem and a check engine light.  They service it a day later and said it just had some carbon build up in the cylinder head and it just needed to be cleaned out.  They poured 2 bottles of cleaning solution in the gas tank and told me it was okay and it just needed to be driven.  They charged me $ 300 for two $5 fuel injector cleaning solution bottles and $ 180 for spark plugs that I provided to be replaced and said its all fixed.  Same day when I picked the car up the check engine light goes back on.  A day later,  I get stranded because the car won't start and missed my trip to Zion. So after the Labor Day weekend I took the car back in.  Now they tell me that the valve head cover and gasket needed to be replace for $ 1200. I'm no mechanic but I know cars.  A brand new valve head cover on EBay is only $ 64,  Any real mechanic will tell you that this is not usually a cause for hard starting unless the leak was intense.  Not even the stealership will charge me that for replacing a valve head cover??? Maybe they can fool me once but twice?  Good luck on getting your car fixed at this European Car of Horrors.  I immediately pulled it out.  Watch out for Josh... I can tell he's not all there upstairs especially with his eyes all jaded and glassy.  Arrogant and can't even listen to what you have to say.  They will rail road you all the way.
