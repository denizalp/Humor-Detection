Anyone who knows me knows that I'm not one for strip clubs. However, if more were like my night here, than I might change my mind.\n\nNo pressure, relaxed atmosphere, in a very nice looking (and clean) venue!\n\nBest part of the night? A 400 lb. (at least) man being brought on stage by a bunch of dancers and they slowly took all his clothes off down to his underwear. Probably the best night of that guys life next to his wedding (he was the bachelor).\n\nThe guy was a real champ! It made for an awesome show!
