Had to update my review just 'coz it just keeps getting better. \n\n\nGreat portion for great price!! I go here for lunch, and I swear I get the best deals. Had to order five-spiced chicken ($ 6.49? Or $6.99 I believe) includes already a fried rice! \n\nTo top it off, I also order CRAB RAGOON. Which is pretty much a cheese wonton with crab & shrimp in it. 5pcs for $4.99, and they were massive and flavourful!!!
