What a relief! After going to PIEOLOGY and finding out that their crust is NOT vegan, I drove all the way over to this place because I seriously wanted some pizza. \n\nYou know when you just have a craving and the day isn't complete without satisfying that craving? Well that was me today after getting shut down at PIEOLOGY. Kind of happy that happened because if it didn't I probably would have prolonged coming here. Sometimes unfortunate circumstances can lead you to tasty pizza.\n\nAtmosphere is chill here. Laid back music, simple modern decor and dining area. Even though it was super busy when I came in, it didn't take long for me to get to the ordering counter. \n\nThe girl who started off my pizza creating experience was very sweet and even asked if I wanted employees to change their gloves for my order upon telling her that I'm vegan! Hell yeah. I feel needy when I have to ask for the glove change but for real I don't like the thought of animal juices touching my pizza.\n\nSpeaking of toppings, they have everything I want on a vegan pizza: spinach, basil, mushrooms, roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts, zucchini, red onion and of course the obligatory oregano just to name a few. \n\nI don't care if it's further from my house, if I want a delicious and QUALITY vegan pizza I'm coming here from now on.
