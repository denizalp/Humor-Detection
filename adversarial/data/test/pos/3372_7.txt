Located in the deer valley location in north Phoenix . Lunchtime out and about and this was close enough to give it a try! I do like how they have a special of the day for $5, today I went with the two enchiladas, beans and rice. Unfortunately they gave me two sides of beans and not my two sides of rice that I had asked for. Even with the order being incorrect there was nothing amazing with the food. Very plain for my taste, but if you live closeby and have that craving then it's your choice.
