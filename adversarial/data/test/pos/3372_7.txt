Being a HUGE Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef fan I had to make a trip here last time I was in Las Vegas.  BurGR is the more affordable of his three restaurants in Las Vegas but still a Gordon Ramsay experience.\n\nWhen we arrived for lunch we were told there would be a 20 minute wait.  They took my cell phone number and said they would text us when our table was ready.  I thought this was great, because I hate it when restaurants give you those big vibrating devices for you to carry around looking like an idiot.  That way you don't have to hold something that a million other people have had their filthy hands on.  We ended up playing slot machines in the casino until our table was ready.\n\nWe received prompt service and all the staff we dealt with were very friendly.  We ordered the Farm Burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger and split an order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Both were cooked exactly the way we ordered them.  Both burgers were amazing.   At first we thought they might be a little on the small side but ended up being very filling.  One order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries is enough for two people to share.  These were some of the best french fries I've ever had.  For dessert, we tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops. One order comes with two, so it's perfect to share with someone.  They were a bit gimmicky but fun at the same time.  We enjoyed our little frozen treats, but probably will not order them again in the future.\n\nWe really enjoyed our overall experience here and guarantee we will be back to explore more of the menu.  It baffles me to read the bad reviews on BurGR, unless we just happened to come on a good day.  People complaining about paying $12 to $15 dollars for a burger need to remember you are eating at a restaurant located in a large hotel\/casino on the strip in Las Vegas with the name of one of the most well known chefs in the world right now.  If you're concerned about saving a little money then join the Total Rewards program and it will get you $1 off each item you order on the menu.  I recommend you try it at least once and see for yourself and if you don't like it then in the words of Gordon Ramsay, \"Pi$$ Off!!\" Just kidding.
