My girlfriend and I went there for the first time the sushi is excellent ordered the  chicken teriyaki and It was very disappointing very small portion compared to many other places I've been too, \nThe other thing is the ambience is very uncomfortable you have employees just standing there watching you eat it seems, wont be going back!!
