This place gets five stars for the bakery and the freshness of the food.  I have to disagree with the comment on the breakfast burrito, it's no Filibertos's or Ranch Market, but it's definitely upper-crust white Arcadia people friendly.  They have black-and-white photographs on the wall, play harmless acoustic music and you don't have to worry about how to say things in Spanish.\n\nThe people here are always nice and the baked goods are simply amazing.  All of the sandwiches or wraps I have had here have been delicious, and since I am a veggie, I appreciate that.  \n\nThe only thing I am disappointed in is that they close at 3 p.m.  I live within walking distance of this place and wish I could get a late-afternoon snack.  But, I know how the area is, and wouldn't expect the business to survive if they tried to compete with Wal-Mart's hours.  \n\nJust visit the place.  You will be happy you did.
