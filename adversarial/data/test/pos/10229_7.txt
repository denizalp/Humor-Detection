Seersucker is a case of \"just fine\" food in a great location. They're in a prime Caesar's location and offer (for Ceasars) pretty reasonable prices. \n\nWe made a reservation and I'd advise you to do that, since Searsucker seems rather popular. It's a good sized space with modern furniture and a menu that encourages sharing. We started with corn muffins ($5) and hot damn!!! these are some tasty bites - a bit spicy, full of bacon and served with sweet butter. Yum! \n\nFor dinner, I had a Cobb salad ($16?) which was ok - I asked for dressing in the side and never revived any at all. See: service, below.\n\nMy dining companions opted for more meaty choices and seemed happy. Our side of mac''cheese ($16) was overly salty but used wagon wheel pasta which made me happy.\n\n\nService...yeah, not the best. Our server was honestly kind of bitchy for no reason. I didn't get a side of salad dressing and didn't want to ask because she was attitude-y Judy & I didn't want spit infused ranch. I'm guessing with a different server this place would be 4 for me.
