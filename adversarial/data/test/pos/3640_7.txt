Ok, here's the deal with Actinolite (in my estimation, anyway, and I eat out a lot). It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes: everyone is wildly raving about something that just isn't there, namely tasty food. I don't give a hoot if you've foraged on all fours for those berries; they had better taste excellent for the price you're charging.\n\nI dined there about a year and half ago and I had the tasting menu with a friend. The server was lovely and the chef was friendly, but that doth not make the food good. Sorry, folks. Let's start with the lowest point: dessert. I spit it out into my napkin. It was chocolate mixed with cepe (a mushroom). Imagine dousing delicious chocolate ice cream with a sauce that tastes like mushrooms? No, really, think of that combination. It was honestly revolting. Nearly liverish. My friend had the same reaction. There's a reason fungus-y shroom isn't a flavour at Baskin-Robbins, ya know? \n\nThe squid on the twig made me laugh. While the texture of said celphalopod was nice, being forced to eat it pretentiously off a tiny branch instead of with cutlery means that your fingers smell fishy for the next course -- great! Fishy fingers to go with weirdo mushroom dessert. And unlike other reviewers, I did not find the famed carrot dish all that. It's essentially carrot lopped off into different shapes on a plate. Ok-tasting, but pretentious to the max. I was glad I wasn't paying because it was expensive and not good at all. I've heard that not ordering prix fixe is the way to go. Maybe one day, but for now, no thanks.
