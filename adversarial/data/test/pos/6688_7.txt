This bank branch is right off of busy Blue Diamond, the speed is 55mph. It can be a pain entering and exiting traffic due to the speed. This location is real convenient for me because of the car drive through ATM. It is perfect for when Mother Nature has PMS and it's 115 degrees in the shade or when it is so cold and windy you think icicles a gonna grow from your nose. It also seems that there isn't ever a line of cars which makes going here fast.
