UMMMMMM......\n\nYea.... I have been to a lot of KHOL'S in Cali area like Irvine.... this place has given me a different perspective....it just reminded me of another ROSS or something... everything was SUPER cluttered & the shoes were all disorganized  & all over the place. My very bad OCD was about to have a heart attack. \n\nThe lines were long & unorganized....\n\nCustomer service area was a HUGE pile of stuff everywhere.\n\nBATHROOMS were SUPER CLEAN & fresh though hahahaaha
