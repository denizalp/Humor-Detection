i always see cici commercials on tv and am instantly sold-- pizza buffet? down :] \n\nwell, i finally found a cici's in las vegas-- since ive never been to one in california. its definitely not a fancy place, but its pretty good for the price you pay. i think the lunch buffet was around four bucks a person-- and you cannot beat that! the pizza was so so, but you get what you pay for! there is definitely no real complaints here! however the only thing i wish was that they had something for dessert-- because their sugary breadstick things were not crackin. so if youre hungry and in this area give this place a try :]
