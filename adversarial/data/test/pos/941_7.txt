You should do your best to avoid this Wal-Mart. When I moved here 7 years ago, I was told I should never go there. I thought he was over-exaggerating. He wasn't. You really should go here.\n\nThe store itself is the dirtiest I've seen any Wal-Mart. Its age really shines through once you're able to compare it to a different location. This must have a detrimental affect on the employees, whose attitudes range from rude to complacent. Their personal appearance looks like they haven't showered in at least 2 days, or even own an iron. I'm really not nitpicky at all when it comes to mine or others' appearances, but when it looks like everyone just doesn't care at all, then the overall vibe becomes negative.\n\nThis trait isn't unique to just the employees. I work late and used to frequent this Wal-Mart on my way home from work to pick up some groceries. I come there some time after 11 p.m. and there are always some odd looking individuals walking around there. I was told this was normal and that \"the freaks come out at night.\" I really didn't care. They didn't bother me. I didn't bother them. It was \"all good in the hood.\"(Literally, my co-workers always tell me I live in the hood.) \n\nAnyway, I had gone there recently at what most would consider \"normal hours.\" I was scared. The parking lot was dark and I thought I was going to be robbed. Every person I saw in the store looked like they were about to come up to me and asked me for a dollar. \n\nI now avoid this place entirely. There is a much nicer Wal-Mart on the Loop 101 and Camelback. It's nice and clean and very much worth the drive(no matter how much a gallon of gas costs.)
