This dive joint is okay, nothing too noteworthy or anything, but it's average. Drinks are cheap and STRONG! I do tip well, because of this. :)\n\nOne male bartender (don't know name) is a roided-out douche-lord donning an Ass-liction shirt which is 3 sizes too small, and seems to be texting his little lover on his cell rather than assisting his thirsty patrons! Once I got his attention, he let out a sigh\/grunt that he had to \"do his job\". LOL. Booo!\n\nOverall, very comfortable and aggressively unpretentious!
