For those Vegas tourists who need to escape from the gaudy frivolity of the casinos and buffets, it's worth it to drive just a few minutes away from the city.  Breathe in, stare at wonder at the beautiful reddish hues of the dramatic scenery and  wander around a bit.  It's just about the closest thing to what most people envision as the Wild West that you can get when you're in Las Vegas.  Don't forget to bring lots of water.  Read the signs describing the geography and history of the area. Bring a camera.
