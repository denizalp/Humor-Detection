Ever since I moved to the Lakewood area, I have passed Earth Bistro Café about a million times. Each time I thought to myself \"I should probably check this place out.\" Well, almost fourth months later: I finally stopped in. \n\nThis place is super unsuspecting. You would barely notice it walking by. The only reason I really did was because I once totally ate it outside and the people sitting on the patio got a good laugh (I use the word patio loosely here, because it's really just some chairs and tables on the sidewalk.) Anyways, once you're inside though it feels like a homey, hole-in-the-wall. Definitely a hidden gem.\n\nMy friend Jill and I started our meal in shock of just how many vegan options they have. I am so used to going to restaurants that boast a \"vegan\" menu only to find they have only a small handful of vegan entrées. Earth Bistro Café has an entire menu of vegan and gluten-free meals. We were so torn on what to get we ended up going with what other Yelpers had recommended in their reviews. To start, we got their guacamole that came topped with pineapple and tomatoes and a side of pita and plantain chips. It. Was. Incredible (later that night I went to Giant Eagle to buy more guacamole because this stuff was good I found myself needing more. Needless to say the store-bought wasn't nearly as enjoyable.) \n\nNext came the entrees. I ordered the vegan tacos and Jill got the black bean burger. Both of which were absolutely incredible. I don't think I have ever tried vegan food this good. It was fresh, flavorful, filling, and most importantly: local. And to think it was a 5-minute walk from my house this whole time. I'm so mad I didn't start going sooner (though I'm sure my wallet is happy.)\n\nI honestly don't think anything that comes out of their kitchen could not be anything less than delicious. Every time the waiters\/waitresses would carry another meal out, every table would stare and simultaneously whisper to their friends \"oh that looks so good!\" I'm not kidding, this happened every single time.\n\nDo yourself a favor and try Earth Bistro Café, vegan or not. The food is absolutely phenomenal.
