I come here often since it's close to my parents' house, but this isn't my fave SB location. Let me explain why. \n\n1. I don't even attempt going into the drive-thru because it is forever full of cars. \n2. Since it's near Summerlin, you have all your snooty Summerlin females who think they are better than everyone with their Lululemon yoga pants and full face of makeup. \n3. The little area where you add sugar or milk to your coffee is always a mess and the trash is full. \n4. It's a small location so there is hardly any place to sit. \n5. The employees aren't the friendliest of people. \n\nGood thing about this location is that they always make my drink right (although my drinks are never that complicated). They don't put a lot of ice in your drink either, so you can actually take more than 3 sips and still have more left. That is all.
