For what I got, this place was not worth my hard earned dough. (Okay, not really hard earned, but earned at the very least...) \n\nThe space is attractive; the patio is impressive; the crowd is not my scene at all. Better pizza could be had in many places, some for less money. My dining companions seemed to like their dishes (chicken burger, gluten-free seafood pasta) but no-one seemed overly impressed. I had the Soma ice cream and it tasted like Breyer's chocolate ice cream that grandma pulled from its two-year hiding place in the back of the freezer. I hope the stuff straight from the store that I've heard so much about is more impressive...\n\nThis place is probably decent for an after-work drink with your douchey banker friends (sorry, I don't mean to give bankers a bad rap. Diff'rent strokes...).\n\nService was good--hosteses and waiter were friendly\/attentive. Maybe if I had more money to throw around, this place wouldn't feel like such a rip.
