My wife and I were in town for my Bday and we ended up here. We were getting back from a show and we walked pass the Cosmo and we ran into a guy advising us there was free limo rides and 2 free drinks. We thought about it for like 1 min and decided to go for it, since it was my Bday. We walked maybe 10 steps and we got into their limo. We meet a family in town for a wedding who were really cool and they ended up inviting us to the wedding the next day. \n\nThe ride was nice, and the company was cool. I think it would be a little weird if there was not a party going on in a limo on the way to a strip club. So, we got in and my wife talked to a manager mentioning it was by Bday and he escorted us up to the top floor. This was a Friday night and it was packed. There were no seats available, but the person my wife spoke to was able to get us a nice seat that over looked the down stairs area too and it was right in front of the bar. I really don't remember how much the drinks were or how long we were there, but it was an amazing time. \n\nThere was a steady stream of girls coming over and asking if we wanted a dance, then it turned into my wife interviewing the girls to see if they were any good at couples dance. I ave to say, it is good to have a wife that not only would come to a strip club with you, but filter through the \"weeds\" as well. I would say after about 5-7 girls we decided on one and we went to the back room. There was a 2 drink min., but since there was 2 of us...it was not too shabby. We did have to buy a drink for the entertainer, but it was well worth it. It ended up being 3 songs for a bill. I had a good time and even better my wife had a great time. She could not stop talking about it the rest of the trip and that was just our first night in town. \n\nWe were getting ready to leave and we ran into the same people we were in the limo with on the way there. Funny how things work out. So we got the free ride back as well and everyone got dropped of at Cosmo. I mean that is where they picked us up at so it seemed fitting. Everyone in the limo tipped the driver so I think he ended up with well over $150.00. I am sure he had a good time listening to everyone's conversation on the way there and back. This was a great stop on our trip and I have a feeling when we are back in town next year, we may have to make another couples stop there. \n\nThe place is huge and amazing. The people were super nice and we always asking if we were comfortable. We
