Suzuya was one of the first dessert cafes that I bookmarked when I first moved to Las Vegas and finally got the chance to try it when my sisters were in town. We made the trek over there before their flight back home because they wanted to bring some goodies back as souvenirs. There is ample parking in the lot in front of Suzuya. The dessert cafe is very cute and comfortable, just as it would belong in a cute-sy cafe in Japan. My sister asked for two pieces of the cheesecake to go. The lady at the register offered to-go ice packs for the cakes when she found out my sister was taking it onto the place. I thought that was very thoughtful and considerate. Each ice pack costs 50 cents. We ordered the strawberry milli cake to eat there. The milli cake came with a syringe filled with strawberry jam along a set of gold plated utensils. My sister asked for an extra set of utensils for her to-go order, but the lady denied us. I found this to be fairly strange as the utensils were plastic. They weren't real gold or anything close it. As we stuck our fork into the crepe cake, the fork would not let go. The cake was very thick and chewy--an odd consistency for cake. We needed a knife to free up the cake from the fork. Would I come here again, definitely not! Unbookmarked this place as we were leaving the cafe.
