I randomly ended up at Hooligans on a Saturday night when I was starving and some of my girlfriends checked-in here. My friend said the food was actually really good here, and this is a friend with exceptionally good taste. Whatever, bar food + good people, sign me the effe up.\n\nHooligans is a brand new bar tucked in the corner of the complex. Once inside the the bar was lit blue and has black & white collages of old school Vegas. It's a locals spot, for sure; or a place off the strip, you can come for a drink and one of the best burgers you'll find in Vegas. \n\nThe bar is the center piece and has quarter poker machines. They have players cards here, y'all, so rack up points. My friends gambled all night and their bar tab was null at the end of the night. Also, the bartenders here were beautiful. Hi Nicole and Sky. \n\nAnyway, on to the truly important thing... This burger! I ordered the Jalapeño Popper Burger. Sweet mother of Pete and all damn things holy; this was one of the best burgers I've ever encountered. 2\/3 lb of grass-feed beef, lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, cooked to medium, topped with cheddar cheese, fresh jalapeño peppers, freshly cut, and tempura-ed (is that a word?), with a bun that's grilled so it's nice and crunchy toasty... I love you, JPB. I got it prepared medium. It came with fries a la in-n-out: freshly cooked and fried. This is the KEY here, all food is cooked freshly. My burger took a little longer to get, but it was worth the wait. This bad boy only cost $11.00 too. It was so big, I got to enjoy it at home a second time. The chef here is the same guy that lent his talents to Bruddahs. You can taste the love in the food and it is of such great quality. I feel like I hit the jackpot Saturday.\n\nHooligans also has TVs for sports games, pool tables, ample space, hi-top tables, attentive staff, a vending machine with snacks and smokes, reasonable prices, a chill, local vibe, rewards system, and amazingly fresh food!! Definitely a fan. Can't wait to go back!
