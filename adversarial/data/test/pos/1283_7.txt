The Skinny: lower than average food (2) with sh^&tty service (0) and stay away! stay far far away! (1).\n\nOkay - confession. My hubs and I totally look for new places to try out in town on Eater Vegas. One of the more anticipated openings this month was Seafood Shack which replaced Isla, the Mexican restaurant in TI. So we checked out there website which advertised the BOGO entree promotion. SOLD! (I can't help it, I'm Asian and I can't help a good deal). We were going the first Tuesday of the grand opening.\n\nSo we were getting a table of 3 and I was the first to arrive. I got seated around 6:15 and waited for the rest of the party to arrive. The bus girl comes by, fills the water and leaves me alone. Fine. \n\nAs my party trickles in, I still had no idea who my server was. By this time, it's around 6:50 before she decides to saunter to our table and even acknowledge our presence. Dead serious. No asking if I wanted a drink, no wondering if I wanted to order an appy or anything. Yeah. It was that bad.\n\nI was watching her like a hawk too - she literally disappeared for a significant portion of the time unlike the other servers around the restaurant. We literally saw her once to take our order, once when our entrees came (she asked us how they were when we didn't even get a chance to take a bite), once to take the dessert order (which I had to flag her down -- she mumbled under her breath \"in a minute\") and three times finally to get our bill right.\n\nYeah, you guys heard me. Three fr$%king times to get the bill right. (She lost our BOGO coupon, neglected to take off a discounted item, gave us another person's bill -- I could've taken off with another dude's credit card --- yeah... that bad). That added another 30 minutes of playtime at the Seafood Shack.I was beginning to think it should be renamed Seafood Inn because at the rate we were going, I thought we might have to sleep in our chairs. We were stranded there for 2 hours. God forbid if you actually had show or something to catch.\n\nAlready the service (or lack thereof) would be enough to detract most people. Add to the fact that the food was subpar at best made the insult even more pronounced.\n\nI ordered a crab louie salad which is not difficult to do well as long as the ingredients are good. The crab meat was severely below expectations. The crab was all macerated, and lacked the sweetness good quality meat. Added to the fact that there were bits of the clear shell and outer shell pieces mixed in, it was no es bueno. Throw in a few meally tomatoes and some rather generic thousand island dressing, you have yourself a sh*(ty experience for $16.95.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of the fish and chips ($17.95) which were put apparently on the same plate for reasons unknown. That was annoying because we were out with a friend and he obviously didn't want to eat off of our plates. Plus, they only provided half of the serving of chips but double the fries. Not that the fries were that great to begin with but come on! The fish itself was greasy, overly battered and quite frankly nothing I would order again. Again, the tartar sauce was some generic stuff you could get at any grocery market.\n\nOur pal ordered a clam chowder (comes in a bread bowl -$8.95) and the linguine with clams ($16.95) but neither was anything special according to him.\n\nBy now, I should have known better and quit while I was ahead. However, I am a sucker for key lime pie and noticed it was on the menu. So thinking that there had to be some sort of redeeming quality about this establishment, I ordered that to share with the hubs while our pal got an apple pie a la mode ($6.95 each).\n\nOkay - let me get this straight - if your key lime pie is f%^king lime green, you know it came out of a box and that there's no freaking way there's any sort of real lime in there let alone, key limes. The oh-so soggy crust accompanied by the rather solid bright green filling from a generic Jello box was a full on textural assault and violation. Would not do this again. I noticed as well, our friend's apple pie - he left most of his pie crust on his plate and it looked like a limp doughy mass.\n\nIn general, I do not have a lot of one star reviews and I really hate writing one unless it is really really bad on all fronts. However, Seafood Shack - you've just +1'ed yourself in my 1 star club. (1 star review).
