\"No. I don't want 5 guys. 5 guys are the guys who can't get no love from me. Servin' up some ok fries, but the price sky high.. ya won't hear no hollerin' from me!\" \nBetween the sloppy staff, the hard to swallow prices, and the OMITTANCE OF CHEESE, which made my bacon burger even HARDER to swallow, this Five Guys location gets a whopping 2 stars. That being said, I think I would have been happier with a Whopper. The only redemption to this meal, which was had on really ugly tables, and super uncomfortable seats, was the glut of french fries. I allegedly had a hot dog too, but it was obviously quite forgettable, because the only detail I really remember from the hot dog was explaining to the broad who took my order that \"everything on a hot dog *doesn't mean lettuce...\" \nI'll go satisfy my appetite with something spectacular....... elsewhere.
