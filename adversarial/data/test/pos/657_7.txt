I had an amazing Yogurt parfait here that was huge so I split with my friend. They also had this huge smoked salmon sandwich I never got a chance to try out, tons of pastries and tons of ice cream!  They also had the cutest shop in the back of cupcake platters, plates, timers, etc.  So adorable!! I wish I had more time to get something but was only in Vegas for 2 1\/2 days.  The place was so cute and I hope they open one in California soon maybe in Santana Row :-)
