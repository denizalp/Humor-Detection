If I ever want to remember the feeling of how the devil almost got me, I think back about the time I attended this timeshare presentation. \n\nI will not go into detail about my experience since it has already been spelt out by many of the negative reviews. \n\nOne thing I will say is, their sales rep kept saying '5 star accommodation.' Common, get a hold of yourselves, Grandview is really not that nice to begin with.
