This restaurant continues to be my go to spot for Korean BBQ since my review a couple of years ago. Every time we go, the restaurant is steadily full with a wide variety of patrons. \n\nYou can choose to cook at the table or have them cook for you. Usually we opt to cook at the table but a few nights ago, we decided to have them cook it for us. Same price. Usually, we opt for the $30 combo that has the daegi bulgogi, dalk gui, and the Kalbi. If I said it right, it is the spicy pork, chicken, and short ribs. That is more than plenty for the 3 of us...leftovers are the best! This last time, we each ordered a spicy pork plate at $13 each (my favorite and I don't really eat spicy food). I felt like we looked like gluttons when the food came out. Very good portions. \n\nI also love the panckak (sp?) they bring out with various items to enjoy with your meal. My 5 year old demolished the white radishes and I had to fight her over the bean sprouts. So good. As always the service is friendly and attentive. I have been to other Korean BBQs where if you aren't in the same culture, you aren't treated the same. Not so with CGJ. I always enjoy my meal here. Inexpensive and delicious food.
