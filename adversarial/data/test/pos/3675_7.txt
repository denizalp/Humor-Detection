This particular location is filled with happy people both diners and workers. You can eat as clean or as dirty as you want at a Sweet Tomatoes.  I have a plan about how I want eat when I roll into vegetable chute, but whatever healthy options I choose are instantly ruined by the copious amounts of ranch dressing and cheese.  When paying do a little research before had an find an online coupon.  Show them you phone and they apply whatever the discount would be. Once you find your table, it's off to the soup, bread\/muffin, and pasta bars.  After partaking in the human version of grazing, if so inclined you can hit the soft serve and other sweet treats.  Better yet, nurse the upcoming food coma with a cookie brought by the table by a smiley employee.
