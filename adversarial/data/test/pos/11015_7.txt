My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.  \n\nWe had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view.
