Terrible RV Resort. Some very strange characters living there. Not a safe park to be in. \"Resort\" is no longer. Not peaceful and \"resort\" has not been taken care of. Grounds are worn and pool is in disrepair. Spa and pool should not even be used. Beware of people taking photos of people in pool from upstairs window with foil on window. Very strange!!!! Used to be a nice resort...no longer.
