The Space Las Vegas is an epic little venue.\n\nTucked away in warehouse land and a bit of challenge to find (thank god for google maps).\n\nWhat is the space? Well, it's a multipurpose venue that you can set pretty much anything up in. A concert, a play, comedy, a wedding, a rehearsal space, you name it.\n\nThere is a bar where drinks can be purchased and they're reasonably priced.\n\nThe Space is probably best known for hosting Monday's Dark (2x a month) which chooses a charity, and various performers and entertainment from the Strips assortment of talented folks come and do their damn thang for charity! At $20 a ticket, it's a total steal.\n\nSupport local awesomeness here!!
