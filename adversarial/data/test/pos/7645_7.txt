Just an average stop on College Street, with better-than-average beers on tap at this 14th stop on the epic birthday bender.\n\nOn entry, we immediately noticed a bar made out of poured concrete in such a way as to look like a giant slab of rough-quarried stone.  Nice idea, but I was careful not to trip and plow into it, for sure.  Seating is exactly what you'd expect at Ted's Collision if it were a real body shop; beat up old barstools that barely balanced on their three good legs and a shaky fourth.  Less likely in a body shop were the candles stuffed into wine bottles (and empty wine bottles covered in wax) that littered the room.  Interesting.\n\nMusic was the next thing we noticed.  It appeared that we were listening to a playlist in alphabetical order of artists' first names.  Among other things, we heard David Bowie, Depeche Mode and Dire Straits.  While this was amusing at first, it got repetitive as we heard a few tracks from each artist and the trend was getting predictable.  It would have been nice to have the rest of the alphabet represented too.\n\nThe last thing I noticed, regrettably, was the washroom.  I only wish this was forgettable, and caution the more germophobic reader to hold it until you reach the next stop.  They were small, ratty and filthy; exactly what you'd find in a body shop, I suppose, but in this yelper's humble opinion the loo is not the place to implement your body-shop shtick.
