SHOULD BE 0. \nIts just sad how a company, and maybe, just a certain store can have so many faults. I havent yelped in years, but this calls for every review on every site possible!!!! \n\nNo heads up for delivery, no email, nothing. Must do your own due diligence and be proactive to even have a shot about delivery times and where trucks might be. Have to call in to talk to customer service just to get a block, and then no call back or message in regards to the matter. COMPLETE AND UTTER DISREGARD FOR THE CUSTOMER AND CUSTOMER NEEDS. \n\nHave to call to speak to a manager, get told, that a sales associate is the manager, only to find out that associate has no power or klout in the team and youre talking to the wrong guy the whole time!! WOW THANKS FOR WASTING MORE TIME!!!\n\nHonestly, good products inside but THROWN DOWN THE TRASH with customer service and lack of business ethics and execution. \n\nWILL NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. \n\nSORRY, ken, I was told by two sources, you were the manager, still waiting on his call BTW so i can stuff his ears with some (F)unny (U)seful (C)ool criticism
