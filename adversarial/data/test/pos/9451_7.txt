I liked Sweet Addiction but I loved CREAM. So it's not the best ice cream place in town but when you combine great ice cream with warm, yummy cookies, you got yourself a winner. The staff was nice and friendly. The establishment was clean and inviting. Prices reasonable  (under $5 a person). The place was busy since it was the afternoon on a warm Sunday but the line went fast.\nI got French Vanilla Ice Cream with a Chocolate Turtle Cookie and Sugar Butter Cookie. My husband got a Cookie Sundae with a Chocolate Chip cookie and French Vanilla ice cream topped with Chocolate Sauce and Whipped Cream.\nWe had our dog with us so we snagged a table out on the side walk (Yay! Dog friendliness!) in the shade and ate our desserts. Everything was delicious.\nI will definitely go again when in the area.
