Went here with a restaurant.com certificate for my daughters 12th bday.... A wedding reception was going on at same time.. We witnessed an extremely drunk girl, who DID NOT look old enough to be served, stagger thru restaurant to the bathroom.. Said bathroom was then closed due to vomit, we had to go outside to use bar bathroom. Went back in and while finishing our mediocre (at best) meals, witnessed the ems being called and the drunk girl being taken out on a stretcher. Horrible experience, service, food and my young kids had to witness the incident with an overserved guest.
