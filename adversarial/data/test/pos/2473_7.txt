Ive been here twice and cant believe Ive forgotten to review it until now. My first visit was a commendation from my sister. I went in after getting my hair done around the corner at Cutting Room Floor and the place was empty. The specialty at Kol3 is Bahn Xeo, vietnamese crepe. Who doesnt love crepes? Its not your typical crepe as its made with rice flour and coconut milk, plus it has more of a deep fried taste, but who doesnt love deep fried? I had a vietnamese coffee and a traditional crepe with chicken to go. The funny part was, the young lady at the front asked me if I had been in before. I hadnt, but my twin sister had, and I thought it was really sweet she \"remembered\" me. The crepe I ate when I got home, and even cold it was delicious. The thing was huge, plus it came with a salad, so definately satitsfying and dare I say, more filling sometimes than your standard Vietnamese fare. \nI will say that going in, the decor is not what I consider traditional Vietnamese. Its all white walls and furniture accented with bright pops of colour. Its also maybe a little more pricey than the average restaurant, but so worth it as Ive never seen these offered anywhere else.\n\nThe second visit was with my mom, sister, aunt and friend Mike. Again, awesome service, so friendly and everyone had a smile on their face. I had the Athena, and the others at the table had the traditional, or the Bacon Cheeseburger (!) crepe. All were delicous, but mine was the best. Just the right amount of spinach, chicken, onion and feta inside. I didnt catch the name of the hot sauce the young lady handed our table, but it was amazing. I dont like spicy anything really, but this complimented everyones crepe nicely. I forgot to mention that the Vietnamese Coffee is well done. Its strong, and not too sweet. They serve it premixed (other places Ive been let you do it yourself)\nSo, if you're looking for something a little different, Kol3 is definately it.
