In the age of Amazon, you have to wonder what keeps these little guys in business. It sure isn't the charm of the people running this place, but there is something to be said for having all this cool stuff right in front of you in reality, and not \"3D\" on a LCD screen.\nThe place is just jammed to the rafters with interesting products. It's definitely marked up, but if you don't mind paying a little for the privilege of having it in your sweaty little hands NOW, then this is the place for you.\nI wanted a yo-yo and they had two right there as I walked in. Pondering the colours, reading the descriptions, and admiring the look of the wood yo-yo vs. the classic plastic one available in different colours, is just something that can't be replaced by going online.\nIncredible store that should be on your Christmas list.
