I came here and ordered a half of an Italian sub ($8.35).  The staff was friendly, but the sandwich was just passable. I really liked that they sliced the deli meat as they made the sandwich, but I found the bread to only be passable.  This definitely does not match Uncle Sam's or Peppi's in the city, but it is a step above Jimmy Johns.
