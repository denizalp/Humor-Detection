When you come to Las Vegas what are you expecting from your hotel? For me, I like great service, a clean room and easy access to the strip or other casinos we may want to visit.\n\nOn this excursion all the important boxes were marked. First, we arrived too early to check in so we were instructed to leave our bags with the bell hop outside. We did, and he attended to us nicely even though the day was approaching SWELTERING status.\n\nSo, off we went in search of the pool. Our company rented cabana # 15 and we were immediately introduced to our server Christine\/Christina. This girl was LEGIT. She was working her tail off making sure all of us had what was required. This started at noon all the way to about 4:30. Seriously, I had to tell her how AWESOME she was.\n\nAfter our escapades at the pool with frolicking adults and a full blown DJ, I decided a small nap was in order prior to our dinner across the street. When I called the bell hop for my bag I expected it to take a nice block of time since I was on the 32nd floor. INCORRECT-a-mundo. It seemed like the bag and the bellman were transported Star Trek style. Yes, I had a plethora of alcohol but I was not THAT tipsy. The bellman was polite & courteous. \n\nOkay, now I was able to investigate the King Size bed. The sheets and the mattress were divine. Yes, the pillows were a bit mushy but everything else was above the bar. The bathroom was HUGE and plenty of items were provided for my use as well as some pilfering. SSHHH!!\n\nThe iron was also weak but hey, let's not be so critical. I would stay at Treasure Island again....in a heartbeat.
