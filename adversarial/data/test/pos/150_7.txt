Third time there and the service gets a bit better every time . The bad thing about this place is the workers bullie eash other if one employee looking something up on a computer for a customer another  employee will come and push him out  of the way to help his customer. \nThey do have a lot of stock .\nThey all don't know what they are talking about.\nThey also don't bargin with there prices.\nThey do have a website that's not that bad.\nIt's not my favorite hobby store.
