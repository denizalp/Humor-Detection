Thankfully Max wrote up a review for this.  I was writing reviews for the Sig Derb in the MGM Grand reviews.\n\nBest game in Vegas....EVER.  Even better than spot the hooker.\n\nTwo rolls of quarters can last you an hour and a half on a bad streak ($20).  I've hit the 200-1 here twice.  In July 2010, February 2011.  Each was a $1 bet.  $200 profit?  Thanks, I'll go blow it all on Craftsteak or head to Mandalay Bay and grab a Surf-N-Turf Burger @ Burger Bar (LOBSTAH BUGAHHH!)\n\nI have gotten drunk at this game for minimum amounts, I've stayed sober at this game, I've played it with 20+ people surrounding it waiting for a seat on a holiday weekend, and I've played it with 1 other person at the table.\n\nBest game in Vegas.......no lie. \n\nNote: Last Sigma Derby machine in Vegas.  Thanks MGM Grand for keeping the dream alive.
