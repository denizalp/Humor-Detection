Hubs had to get another new phone for his work line and needed one right meow!!!\n\nI called and the ladies had one black 8 Plus left. ($799) She said that she would hold it and I explained we could be there within a few minutes.\n\nI tagged along and glad I did! Beautiful new bright pink neon store next to the new Pizza Rev. \n\nThe young ladies were sooooo nice, helpful and prompt!\nHe also was due for a new case and they actually had the Otter style he was supposed to order off amazon a few days prior. ($59)\n\nThe young lady helping us was nice and offered to put the phone on payment plan but since he needed to pay full price and get a receipt she did just that with a smile.\nSomething about he needs to turn it in to reimbursement.\n\nWe were in and out within less than 15? minutes and I will definitely be back whenever I need a new phone...well maybe because I plan to order our iphone 10's online via preorder :D\n\nCall before if you need a specific phone...you might get lucky and they have it...just like our luck ;)
