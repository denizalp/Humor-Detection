Wow what a disgrace.. \nMy husband and I picked this hotel for our wedding night because he proposed inside the restaurant and thought it would be romantic. \nWorst idea we have ever had. \nMy soon to be husband picked the most premium room, and requested roses candles and what not. \nWhen we got in the room after our wedding, after such a long day we were just looking forward to relaxing, that never happened. \nWe checked in  and we got our ride to the room. First of all, it didn't look like the resort that it advertise sit to be. It looked like a motel. \nWhen we got our room, we never got the roses and candles that we requested, but we did get a bathroom infested with ants and above the bed on ceiling, big nasty cob webs. I was not comfortable sleeping like that so we called and we were put in another room. \nIt seemed fine, I didn't notice any ants or cob webs but in the morning my husband found a cockroach(!!) on the floor! A cockroach ladies and gentlemen! \nAwful way to start our honeymoon worst mistake of our lives.
