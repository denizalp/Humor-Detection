I just love this place. And have I told you how much I love their eggplant parmesan?! I truly appreciate that they leave it unbreaded, so you can truly enjoy the flavor without all the over abundance of breading. Monday is half price pizza night, yum!! And this is what keeps me coming back time after time after time.
