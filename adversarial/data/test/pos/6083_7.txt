We visited Griddlecakes for brunch and were greeted as soon as we walked through the door, and seated in an open booth.  The place was otherwise full inside and outside, so we must have timed it just right.\n\nOur drink order was taken right away while we perused the breakfast selections and our server was back shortly to take our food order.\n\nI decided on the Short Stack Combo for $8.98.  It included 2 hotcakes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and home fries.  The hotcakes were good; fluffy and light. The bacon was very crispy, as I like it.  The eggs were standard fare.  The potatoes, well, I usually leave home fries or hash browns on my plate, but these were little cubes of deliciousness that were partially crispy and partially soft.  I really enjoyed them. \n\nThe BF ordered the Meatlovers Scramble $10.99, which was eggs scrambled with bacon, sausage, ham, homes fries, and cheese.  Served with biscuits & gravy.  The scramble was good, but the biscuit seemed stale and the gravy was pasty instead of tasty.\n\nWe would probably visit again, but it would not make the top of our brunch list.
