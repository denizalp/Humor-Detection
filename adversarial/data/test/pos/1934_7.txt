Always good memories coming here for the UW Badgers Basketball games.\n\nI have nothing but fond memories, no matter who the opponents they're playing against.\n\nThey have metal detectors now at the door, which is a plus since you don't have to unzip your jackets anymore and feel like a flasher. No more flashlight searches in ladies' purses either!\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nHope you're still watching and falling asleep at the games, Marty. Even up there.
