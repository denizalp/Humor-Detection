My sister and I stopped by Olive Garden for dinner and it was super crowded on a Thursday night!  We waited about 20 minutes for our buzzer to light up to tell us our table was ready! \n\nWe were taken to a booth and the fun began! \nWe Perused the menu only to find the wonderful selections to create your own never ending pasta bowl! Never ending and boy did it keep coming! \nI had to tap out after one bowl and two two fork fulls of the second (I know, I'm a lightweight)...\n\nOur servers name was Esrin and she was great! Very knowledgeable of the menu and the preparation of each dish!  She checked on us numerous times, the beverages restocked, the pasta coming and he bread plenty! \n\nOh yes, Esrin offered us a sample of a Moscato wine and it was very good! I suggest ordering a glass if you order chicken, fish or something with a white sauce! \n\nNow I see why there was such a crowd on a Thursday night!
