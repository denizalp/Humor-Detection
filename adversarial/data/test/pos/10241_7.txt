*THIS PLACE IS STILL OPEN*\n\n[Service]\nIt's all-you-can-eat so there is no service lols. Anyways this place is a joke but I paid $10.99 for lunch...I don't mind running the whole place by myself. I'm warning you right now, you need to go up to the waiters and tell them what you want. No one will care about you. The only good thing is, they will collect your dishes and give napkins out faster than other restaurants. Anyways, go on Tuesdays or Fridays so you get the special discount!\n\n[Food]\nHonestly it sucks, it sucks balls but it was better than some of the buffets in Las Vegas (like the ones you do under the buffet of buffets deal). I'm going to recommend some dishes because they were legit okay:\n- Mushrooms (teriyaki\/grilled)\n- Soup (lots of MSG but to the tongue it was fabulous)\n- Veggies (thank god they didn't mess this up)\n- Dessert (I'm talking about the soup-based ones)\n- Fried chicken wings (super crunchy skin, I like lols)\n\nAlthough it was not a good buffet I also think for this price, you can't beat it. I haven't had diarrhea after eating it (positive!) and my stomach was filled to the top. I thought the soup weren't bad, but I'm a soup person.
