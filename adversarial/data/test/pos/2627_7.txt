-An overwhelming smell of FEET when you walk in the door.\n\n-A little expensive. $12 bucks for a used blouse.\n\n-Friendly service.\n\n-I think this place caters to the Chico's crowd.\n\n-Clean restroom.\n\n-Convenient parking.\n\n-UGH! The smell of feet and smelly used shoes stayed with me all day.
