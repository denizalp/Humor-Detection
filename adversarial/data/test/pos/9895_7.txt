This place used to be the place to be. Recent few years they have gone downhill. Service is non-existent on a busy day. Food wise it is nothing to write home about. Their dusty cajun flavour wings were really good once upon a time. I think the kitchen changed thats why. I posted a picture of a feather stuck to my wing. Totally\nUnacceptable.
