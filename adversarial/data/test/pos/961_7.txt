I don't know why I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory. Maybe it's the atmosphere, the lighting, the service or the 9 hour wait, but something always keeps me craving it. \n\nThe food here, as has been my experience at most other Cheesecake Factory locations, is right around mediocre. I can't quite put my finger on it; it's pretty good, never bad or not fresh, but it almost ALWAYS has me running home right after to take care of some, er, business. I heard once that they don't change their cooking oil very frequently. Whatever it is, it always gets my stomach, and the same holds true for everyone I go with. We actually coined a name for it, you usually get the \"6 o'clock sweats\" - you go to bed okay but then wake up around 5 or 6 am with your stomach turning. \n\nThe service at this location was great and we dined outside, which was nice (large seating area out there). Skip the sangria and stick with the martinis or margaritas, or just plain beer or wine.
