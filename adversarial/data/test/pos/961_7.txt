Poor customer service! If I come in at 11:05 o should still b able to get food. I'm the customer...i went back on sunday and  i was served well so 4 stars because i ate but they need to let ppl know they dont serve food after 10:59pm when they close at 12...\n\nTHE REST OF THIS MONTH THE ENTIRE MEUN IS $5 THATS RIGHT ALL MEANS ARE $5!!
