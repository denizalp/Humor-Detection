Final evaluation ASAP but to date they have been completely efficient and courteous. I shattered the glass on my Nexus 6 and Motorola had me send it to Futuretel. I just got off the phone with them and was very pleased with the service and price. I will amend this when the repaired phone is received.\n\nFour business days and the repaired Nexus 6 arrived ready to use. I found the price fair given the phone's original cost and from what my techie friends tell me, the complexity of replacing the screen without damaging the phone.\n\nI would recommend this company without hesitation.
