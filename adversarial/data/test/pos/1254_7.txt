My new favorite place in Las Vegas. I cant believe I haven't been here sooner!\n\nIve been to Hyde in L.A. a number of times and it was always awesome but this venue is absolutely breathtaking. From the unique chandeliers to the water show view this is a must visit. \nWe had a table right on the dance floor. I love the vibe here because its more of a upscale lounge then nightclub, there is a small dance floor but mainly there are tables and couches. The ambiance is intimate and very appealing. I had their white peach Bellini, it was perfect. I recommend trying that specific drink. Our cocktail server was very pleasant. I will def come back every chance i get!
