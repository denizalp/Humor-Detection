The Veggie Sliders are baaaack!! (They are vegan with the Sweet Thai sauce, or ketchup, of course.) \n\nI'm from the midwest, where White Castles are part of the urban culture and everyone has a story or two to tell about a WC experience.  When I gave up beef in high school, I would eat the chicken rings and fish sandwiches\/nibblers. After giving up all meat, I was left with french fries. However, I moved to AZ a few years ago and I swear, as soon as I moved, they introduced the veggie sliders. Unfortunately, there were no White Castles west of my hometown at the time. Then came the opening of this Vegas location in 2015. I was ecstatic! \n\nI drove to Vegas, went straight to this White Castle, and glazed in amazement as I saw that they sold the Veggie Sliders. Once I reached the cashier to order the Veggie Sliders I was advised that they stopped selling them.  I cannot express the levels of 1st world sadness that came over me. I sulked into the background as the rest of my family joyously ordered cheese fries and chicken rings with extra honey mustard.   We returned a few months later so family and friends could get their fix and lo and behold, the veggie sliders were back!! Security cameras may or may not show me dancing around in front of the register. \n\nThe veggie sliders are a Dr. Praeger creation, made with veggies (carrots, broccoli, spinach, etc.) instead of soy.  Do not compare them to the original sliders (although, if they teamed up with Beyond Meat or Gardein, they could replicate those); you will only be disappointed.  These sliders are vegan (including the bun), and the Sweet Thai sauce option is also vegan. Some veg*ns do not like them; I love them!  I love being able to eat a full meal at the same place that my non-veg family eats. And I don't care if they are \"healthy\" or not (they may be). You don't go to White Castle for healthy meals; you go for the junk food!\n\n\nThis Vegas location stays packed, particularly later in the evenings.  I've had success in beating the crowds by going earlier in the day, before noon.  The employees are constantly cleaning the dining area, so it tends to stay clean and well stocked.  The drinks are self-serve here, unlike other WCs, which took away my joy of asking for a \"mix\" (which only White Castle OGs will understand).  \n\n\nThe prices at this location are jacked up, up to 50% or more on some items (e.g. The Veggie Sliders cost .99 back home; they cost $1.79 here! Milkshakes are nearly $6!!).  Also, this may very well be the only White Castle in existence that doesn't have a drive-thru, so come prepared to go inside. And definitely walk, not drive, as parking is almost non-existent along the strip.\n\nAside from my complaints, the fact that after nearly a century there is finally a White Castle west of the Mississippi, it's open 24\/7, and they have the veggie sliders, AND it's a short road trip for me, is a win-win.
