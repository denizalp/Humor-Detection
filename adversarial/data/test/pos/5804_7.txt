Uber eats did it again it struck gold.\n\nWhat a great resto first time hearing about it and we really enjoyed it. Food came pretty quickly a little cold but it's Saturday night I get it. \n\nButter chicken was really good, a little kick to it but not to spicy. The chicken was shredded which was cool I've only had cubes before. \n\nWill for sure be ordering with them again.
