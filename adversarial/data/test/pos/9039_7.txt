Many have hyped up this place has Toronto's version of a Joe Beef or Au Pied De Cochon; but Antler is a grower and not a shower. Fairly new, Antler shows potential, but is still far from the hype. \n\nDrinks are below average (the worst Moscow Mule I've ever had). The portions are rather small, especially for the entr√©es. Price wise, it's a bit pricey considering you might have to swing by McDonald's for a few double cheese burgers to fill you up.
