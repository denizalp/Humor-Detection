So this was my birthday dinner, and I was so ecstatic to dine here for my lovely getting closer to 30 birthday. The service was not bad at all, but I thought the progression of my food was taking forever. I have done prefixe before so I know how long it's suppose to take to enjoy the food, and I didn't expect to be full off the secondi course. Anways,  I didn't do prefixe but did my own type of prefixe with a twist of Nina :) I ordered in the style of a prefixe but chose the food I wanted. appetizer of calamari was a bit salty, and for a person like myself that loves salt; I felt like it was a tad bit salty..eekkkk as for the lobster and the fish I thought were decent. Not out of this world good,, and not worth the price good. As for the last course LAMB CHOPS!! it was pretty delicious, but it wasn't mind blowing like I would have loved it to be :( (if it were at the keg it would have blown my socks off but not at mario batali's restaurant ) all in all I wished I had gone to aureole or guy savoy like I intended, but the reservations that accommodated my party didn't accommodate my time :( whatever, over and done with.... \n\nNOT RECOMMENDED FOR FOODIES, AND GREAT FOR TOURISTS!
