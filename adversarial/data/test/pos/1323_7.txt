The gas areas and the store were clean, but the men's room needed some help due two urinals out of service. A great selection of snacks and candies.\n\nI ordered a hot dog using their \"Made-To-Order\" touchscreen and other than quite a lot of upsell opportunities (extra cheese? want two?) it was simple enough, My number was called and I ate it outside. One major problem - the diced tomatoes included several pieces of tomato core. Ick!
