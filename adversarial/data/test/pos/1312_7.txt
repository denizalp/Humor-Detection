Where do I start?  If you know anything about music and what a DJ should actually sound like, stay far far away.\n\nI went here to see Craze and never thought I could be so disappointed.  The opening DJ was painful to listen to.  Even with a serato, he couldn't beat match to save his life.  He also couldn't get his levels right, come up with a decent track selection, or scratch (um, you're opening for Craze... stop embarrassing yourself).  The crowd still ate it up.  I'm not normally very judgmental, but this crowd was the lowest of the low and not what you would expect in a Vegas club.  The go-go dancers were ok with the exception of one - she had no clue what she was doing.  The dancers are supposed to set the tone for the crowd, so I guess she fit in perfectly.  When Craze went on, he totally played for this crappy crowd.  I had to book it out of there.  It was a very disheartening experience.\n\nI wish I could give this place zero stars.  The staff was nice, so I guess that's how they earned their star.
