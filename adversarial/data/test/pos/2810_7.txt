A totally decent diner\/café right by awesome West Side Market.  In fact, there's a door that connects the café to the market.\n\nMy friend brought me here a couple Fridays ago before she and I headed to West Side Market--a totally unnecessary food stop given how much irresistible food is sold within the market!  Nevertheless, our café breakfast was good.  I ordered the tomato and cheese frittata, which was quite nice, and the hash browns that came with the dish were possibly the best I've ever had.  \n\nFriend and I sat at the bar where we watched coverage of the Casey Anthony trial--I've been following the case since July 2008 and am absolutely disgusted and appalled that the jury managed to find Anthony NOT GUILTY--and received casual friendly service.
