I have an on again off again relationship with Trader Joe's... I love it one day and hate it the next... mostly, I've hated it only a couple of times when I bought a bunch of fresh produce and then waited a day or two too long to eat the stuff and by then, it was bad.  \n\nBut, Jared's been getting amazing salmon at this location over the last few months, so I am back on with TJ's at the moment...\n\nWe went in to this location today to stock up the fridge, and $83 later, we came out with 5 bags (eco-friendly Yelp bags no less) filled with healthy grub for the week.  Well, most of it was healthy!  There is always interesting unique foods at TJ's which keeps shopping fun - we went for a few new products from the frozen section on this trip including a curried rice dish called Biryani, frozen grilled eggplant and zucchini, and vegetable shu mai.  I also saw that they have mochi which I love and will likely purchase on a future visit.\n\nWe made the pecan-crusted salmon for dinner tonight, along with some fresh veggies and rice, and it was delicious!  \n\nSo, thanks Trader Joe's for all of the goodness that will be fueling me this week... as long as I find no mold or rotten bananas, I'll be back again to see you soon!
