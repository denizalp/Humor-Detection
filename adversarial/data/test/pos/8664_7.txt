Just opened on Tuesday, much needed lounge at The Mirage\n\nthe hotel itself is starting to look a bit dated, glad to see they are taking steps to try and modernize it\n\nI think this used to be the high limit slots area and the accompanying Center Bar was the casino cage\/host offices\n\nIn any case, the Center Bar was a bit crowded, so went to meet few friends at the newly opened Parlor Lounge.  Made a nice choice to smoke a few cigars from the Big Smoke Show we attended at that hotel.\n\nThey have a decent piano player there to add to the ambiance with lounge music, it was a nice touch, different from some of the other bars on the strip.  Not too loud or boisterous like the pianos at Harrahs, similar to the lounge at Paris\n\nOur server was a gal named Gaby, attractive, nice, but a bit overwhelmed.  We noticed she was one of the only servers in here, and her manager actually stepped in to help her in serving drinks. Not sure if it was a scheduling issue or maybe a no-show, but the poor thing really had her hands full this night with a pretty good crowd here.\n\nA lot of the Big Smoke attendees stopped off here as well to relax and light up with a few drinks.\nIt did get kind of smoky after some time, so maybe they will make note of that and increase the ventilation system in here to counter that.  It made for a nice getaway lounge in the middle of the casino though, somewhere where we could actually have a drink, smoke and conversation.\n\nThey had a cocktail drink menu with the typical mixology creations, but since we were smoking a few stogies, we opted to stick with scotch straight up.\n\nDon't come to the Mirage too often, but when I do, I will make sure to keep this place in mind as a nice place to meet and have a drink.
