We found the perfect recreational vehicle for us at the RV show. We locked the doors behind us and started talking numbers with our sales guy and a numbers guy. We did the back and forth thing and after an hour and all kinds of different options WRITTEN down, we agreed on a price. \n\nThe numbers guy left and returned with the final paperwork. I immediately realized the final paperwork was $800 MORE than our agreed upon price. I asked to see the handwritten paperwork. He didn't have it. And he wasn't willing to produce it. He claimed the numbers he had on the contract were what we agreed on and I called BS! \n\nI had a big problem with this situation. The guy claimed the paperwork wasn't available??? Sounds like a Hilary move to me!! Because of my persistence, he finally left and brought the paperwork back and then said \"it was a mistake\" and that he couldn't sell it for the agreed upon price!!\n\nAnyhow, while we were inside the RV with the doors locked, several people were back to take another look, knocking on the doors and windows. Maybe THAT was another one of their tricks!!! I have to admit it worked because we felt a bit pressured that if we walked away someone else was going to grab it!!\n\nWe decided to sign on the dotted line because we wanted it, even at the higher price!! I figured I'd contact the corporate office, prove my case (which I did) get a credit, right?? HELL NO!! The manager at corporate simply admitted that it happens all the time and basically, too bad. We signed a contract, agreeing to the price. \n\nIf you shop there, RECORD your experience talking numbers and, if they play tricks on you too, blast it on social media so they put a stop to their crooked practices!!!\n\nSo, although we love our RV, we don't like La Mesa, nor do we trust them!!!
