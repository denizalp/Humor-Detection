Ah, Gigi. My favourite take-out\/delivery 'za of all time.\n\nThis could be a 5 star review, but it's 4 because... well... it was infamously closed for... yeah, you read the news story.\n\nThey take their ingredients seriously and will deliver until 4am. For $22 with tip you can get a large pie with all of your favorite toppings. \n\nI'm a fangirl for their large, extra cheese, 'shrooms and green olives. Try my toppings and thank me later. Their sauce is a salty mistress you will wish came as a dipping side, too. Awooga. \n\nGOTTA MENTION: They also have fresh-as-eff toppings on their slices, and serve them up for $4. That's amore.
