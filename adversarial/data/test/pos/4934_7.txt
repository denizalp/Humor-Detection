**SCROLL TO BOTTOM FOR SUMMARY**\n\nLet me first say I may come to update this review later if I can, or if not maybe just write a new one all together. I've only recently moved into the area and have only had the chance to go three times this week to EOS thus far. \n\nAt any rate this review is mostly just a first impression. I know nobody likes a long story so I'll try to be brief. First I come from a gym that is much much smaller so I will say that the equipment variety was nothing short of spectacular, not to mention it is clean and well kept. If you're into bodybuilding, or any strength training then the gym is your oyster. They also have a Crossfit looking room with big tires n such that I haven't ventured into, but it looks nice, too.\n\nThe employees for the most part give me a \"IDGAF\" attitude and asking where equipment is, or my God even smiling when I walk through the door and saying hello seems to them seems be a stab in the face.\n\n Most of the patrons there seem very, very fit. I'm 6' and 180lbs. I'm not a giant, but I'm not small, either. These people are mostly jacked. So if you're intimidated by such things and can't work well in that environment, then it may not be the place for you. They also give the same vibe of the employees, but maybe in this case it's all in my head from being new and simply feeling like all eyes are on me (They aren't, but you know the feeling). \n\nIn summary, for $25 dollars a month I can deal with employees that want to throat punch me for existing and a very possible presence of steroid abuse in the gym. I don't say that because I'm envious, but because I know what it looks like from past experience. \n\nOh! And for the $25 you get all access to all their saunas, classes, etc. You can also bring a guest however many times you want, and they're open 24\/7. So if you're unafraid of being a little fish in a large, quite possibly juiced up pond, then go for it n I'll probably see you there!
