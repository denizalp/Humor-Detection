My friend and I drove to Utah to go to Cracker Barrel and it was so delicious! When I heard they were coming out here, I go so excited we don't have to drive so far. I was sadly let down when I came here to eat.\n\nI'm not sure if it's the hype in the valley or what, but it does not have the same feel as the one I went to. It seemed very rushed in there, and we barely saw our waitress. Almost as if they don't have enough staff working.  I ordered catfish with with greens, mac & cheese, and broccoli.  I had asked for hot sauce right when the food came out and it took a good while for it to get to me.She seemed overwhelmed. My mom liked her food, although I don't remember what she ordered. I know we both had a side of cornbread, which was the driest cornbread I had ever eaten. No exaggeration. Literally crumbled when you went to pick it up.  The hush puppies were tasty, and those were gone in no time.  \n\nI do love the store with all the candies from childhood, games and trinkets. If you are looking for special gifts for a special someone, you are bound to find something here. To find good food on the other hand, I'm not too sure.  Maybe I'll go back and try another day.
