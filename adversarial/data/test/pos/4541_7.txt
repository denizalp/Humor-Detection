Plaka is a little off the beaten path. -- deep south Calgary, in a Shawnessy strip mall near Zellers and Cdn. Tire . . .   \n\nIt isn't hugely visible, even standing right in front of it., but this tiny restaurant serves up fantastic Greek food, and has for years.  \n\nI assume it's a family business, as it has that comfortable relaxed vibe. \n\nThey've always treated me like family, even if I'm just there for takeout.  Heck, one time they plunked a shot of ouzo in front of me while I was waiting to pick up my order.  Just because.  \n\nThe menu is what you'd expect from any Greek establishment, but Plaka just seems to do it better.  \n\nOn a personal note -- I visited Greece a number of years ago, and I have to say:  sitting in Plaka, and eating their food, brings back the restaurants I tried in Greece like no other in town.
