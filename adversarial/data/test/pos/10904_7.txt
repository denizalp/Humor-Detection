The barista seemed nice but came in for tea....didnt like their teas as much as Jarrods down the street. I might come back to try their coffee but not sure.\n\nBad vibe....Had 2 filthy couches ( I felt if I sat on them I might get bit or something, mind you I am not boojie or anything...It was just gross ), a pool table, and several high top tables. Felt more of a bar that served food than a little coffee shop. The bathroom is dingy and smelled like urine (again reminded me of a bar ). \n\nHowever they make some baked goods and tried their zucchini bread....not too bad. I also bought some other goodies to bring home....\n\nThey also sold ice cream, I believe Thrifties.\n\nBut honestly not sure if I would come back there...been there, tried that type of thing !
