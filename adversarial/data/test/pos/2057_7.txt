Conveniently located immediately at the bottom escalator entering the casino from the parking garage & valet.  I always get the same thing, nothing fancy either a triple espresso w\/ Splenda or a doppio con panna lol.  \n\nIt's tough to give Starbucks less than 5 stars cause I've really never had a bad experience & how do you mess up plain Jane espresso.  They were quick as I waited on my parents friends & friendly.  I rarely go to Stratosphere unless I'm going to Top Of the World or someone is vacationing there.  Overall, excellent Starbucks.
