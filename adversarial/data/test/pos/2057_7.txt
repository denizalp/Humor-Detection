How I LOVE little quaint cafes where I can sit in a comfy chair and people watch, while sipping on a hot cup of chocolate\/tea\/coffee.\n\nTsaa is pronounced \"Cha\" or \"Cha-ah\"; it's how Filipinos say tea. This lovely tea shop (which also serves hot chocolate, coffee and other drinks) is run by the hard working Ramos family. Hospitality is first and foremost in their business: you can tell by the way they greet you with a genuine smile, bring your drinks to your table, bake their scones in house (not hard and crumbly but light with the texture of a biscuit), and lovingly create their delicious and fresh food in their small kitchen. \n\nThere are tempting displays of organic vegan desserts from The Earth Organic and Dufflet Pasteries. Behind the desserts are over 100 different kinds of tea (they can special order a tea for you). Along the opposite wall is a colorful collection of tea pots and coffee presses. There's even an electric fireplace to add to the charm. \n\nI had the smoked salmon bagel which turned out to be a full blown sandwich: smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, cucumber, avocado, havarti cheese on a toasted bagel. The sandwich was so flavorful and very satisfying. I also had a small butternut squash soup which was thick and savoury. My husband enjoyed his chai tea along with a cheese and chive scone and a tiny bowl of lentil soup; both soups were made in house.\n\nI'll have to come back to try their tempting halo halo dessert where they add ube ice cream, pinipig (similar to rice crispies), and leche flan (custard).\n\nFull disclaimer - I fell in love with this place before I realized I went to the same church the owners do.
