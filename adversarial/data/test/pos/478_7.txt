While there is no ambiance to speak of except eating outdoors in the heat, a mister is present, and the food is really tasty.  Changing it up a bit, instead of my usual Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich, this time I opted for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich instead, and was not disappointed.  While not heaping with meat, the roll was filled enough; smeared yellow mustard on the roll gave off just enough tang to the moist, lean pastrami embedded along with it; and the overall effect with a side of Fries was quite satisfying.  I will most certainly be back!
