The Crack Pie Ice cream is TO DIE FOR!!!! Crack pie is also very delicious as well. I've been a longtime IG follower and was pumped to hear that there was a MILK in Vegas back in April. Had a local take me to the money and spent a shit ton of $ on desserts for the 5 hours drive back to California. \n\nBest cookies to order in my opinion are the compost and cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookie. I honest feel like the cornflake is the best. If you have a craving for corn, grab the cornbread cookie. First time I had it, it hit the spot... Second time around it kind of tasted different. Hoping that that was just the heat and alcohol causing the difference. \n\nWhen ordering the soft serve, do yourself a got damn favor and get the crack pie with cornflakes... That shit is FIRE!\n\nOVERALL - love this damn spot & they need to come to SoCal!!
