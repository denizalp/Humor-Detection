If they run out of one of the pokes they will make it to order for you! they make a small batch at a time so the food doesn't sit out. bare bones kind of place so just swing by to pick some up. most everything is $15\/lb - pricey if you're coming from LA (bc poke is trendy and everywhere there) but worth it once in a while bc there aren't many legit poke places in Vegas - and none near me.
