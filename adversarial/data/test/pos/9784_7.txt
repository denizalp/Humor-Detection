This is what dog heaven must be like.......according to my dog at least. \n\nI was happy to see that the former Pineville Puppy Cafe has since moved on and up to the big city. In my previous time in the Queen City, I was literally dragged here by my little pup for the first few weeks to teach him how to socialize with other dogs and some humans too. It was a great experience for the both of us. \n\nWhile checking out places to live this past week, I stumbled across the Canine Cafe once again. I was impressed with the new location. It is a dog emporium colorfully decorated which is funny since dogs are color blind but the sense of smell is a different story which is the main reason to come here, TREATS!\n\nI know every pooch, no matter the size, loves food or good game of tug of war. I brought the Hobbes in to check out the items in the freezer. He decided to go with the Peanut Butter cake. Peanut Butter is his biggest weakness. He can't say no to it. \n\nHobbes approved of the new location and PB cake with 5 PAWS!
