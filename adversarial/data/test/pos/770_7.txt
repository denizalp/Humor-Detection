I have come to this cute little beer and wine bar a couple of times.  Last weekend I decided to take my friend there since she is new to town and enjoys drinking wine. The bartender we had was horrible.  \n\nWe sat down and he was nice to us when we got there and got our drinks right away.  Then he never checked on us, never asked how are drinks were or asked how are day was.   All he was during was talking to a girl at the other side of the bar.  When we asked for water he just throw it at us. Since the bartender was so rude to us, decided to pay for our drinks and leave.   \n\nHopefully next time we will have a better experience.
