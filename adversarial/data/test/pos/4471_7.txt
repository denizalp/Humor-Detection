This is the real deal.  Patisserie Notre-Dame Du Rosaire is just like the bakeries in \"the old country,\" in this case Portugal.  Their goods are made on the premises, fresh, reasonably priced, and the store is conveniently located ... for some.\n\nThe piece de resistance is their pasteis (plural) de nata.  Even if I'm being a pedant about correct grammar, this info will be useful since you won't be able to eat just one - because of the reasonable prices and because of how good they are.\n\nPortuguese bakeries can be funny places. You might see some elaborate, eye catching pastries and start salivating, and then find them to be just ok.   Conversely, you might see some blander looking ones, and then find that they are quite good.  Not so with the pasteis de nata ... they are as reliable as the sunrise.\n\nThe service at Patisserie Notre-Dame Du Rosaire can start out slightly aloof, but if a person demonstrates an interest in their offerings, their culture, and their country, then they definitely warm up.  Since I see such an observation\/complaint in other reviews, please try that, sullen hipsters of the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood.  That said, they are in a great spot, within view of beautiful Parc Mont-Royal, and close to other Portuguese establishments, which are located on either side of Blvd. St.-Laurent, with Rue Rachel as sort of the implied southern border and St.-Joseph as sort of the implied northern border.\n\nBe sure to stop by if in this beautiful city and (literally) bag some pasteis de nata and other decadent, caloric, tasty goodies.  Also, as you might guess, if you are using the Metro, the stop is (Plateau) Mont-Royal.
