I walked into Model Land today ready to drop $2000 on a new 4 rotor heli. While I was waiting in line I overheard the owner's conversation with an RC single rotor heli enthusiast. \n\nThe part of the conversation that stuck out to me was:\n\nOwner: \"What do you think of these guys buying drones?\" \n\nClient that just spent $500: \"They're gay.\"\n\nOwner: \"Yep, I only stock them because they make me money.\"\n\nThe owner then went on to rant about how most people who bought the drones were idiots and how it was only going to take one drone flying into a jet liner to make the whole business of RC heli's illegal. He said \"I dare transport Canada to fine me and confiscate my equipment. Tell them to come and do it.\"\n\nShame on you sirs. Shame on you. You lost my business, and that of a friend who sent me to see you. Shop local? Somewhere else maybe.
