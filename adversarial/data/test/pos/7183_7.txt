The Forum Shops at Caesars are all overpriced high-end label stores. If you aren't looking to spend big bucks, the GAP, H&M, Bath & Body Works and Nike Town are your only real options. The stores are really geared toward your highrollers and guests who wish to blow the money they just won gambling.\n\nI still recommend visiting the Forum Shops b\/c they are fun to window shop and the theme within the mall mirrors some of the streets of Rome with its fountains. Additionally, two of the fountains are animated. At the end of the strip of shops, there is a large circular aquarium with beautiful marine life within.\n\nMy advice, visit the Forum shops to view the scenery, but save your money and buy any luxury items at your local high end boutiques. The LasVegas Coach store, etc. carries the same exact items as my local south coast store does. \n\nThe forum shops feel grand with marbles and high ceilings every where. The most impressive sight is the entrance where there are spiral escalators with gigantic marbled statues beside and interior walls with large statues. I think there are 3 shopping floors. The first 2 floors are brand name stores: Burberry, Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Gianni Versace, Gucci, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, Salvatore Ferragamo, Tiffany & Co., and Valentino. To see the moving statues, you need to reach the highest floor and go deep inside just to see them. I think every hour, there is a show but I missed it when I was there.\n\nThere are more boutiques toward and pass the moving statues. No food court on sight. By the time I reached the top floor, there was only Cheesecake Factory restaurant. There are many booths for gelatos and coffees but nothing to really fill up my belly. Very disappointed. So I walked back for almost an hour to find a restaurant elsewhere.\n\nTip: Wear comfy shoes as the floors feel very hard. Also, dine somewhere else before getting here.
