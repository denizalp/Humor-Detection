This little mom and pop shop is the -premiere- date spot for Pittsburgh's growing ghetto community. Seriously though, what can be said about it? Well the location is great, which merits a star, if you are coming from or going to work and need a bite to eat, Pittsburgh's integral T and bus stations are just across the street. The food here isn't bad, and the restaurant has plenty of seating. Now for all the down sides.. The service here has never been great, I know it's McDonald's and it's in a busy city center, but you can always count on many lines and a lot of young employees joking around and goofing off here. Not only this, while you are waiting in said lines you can observe one of the following: someone trying to sell you stolen items; a homeless person accosting you for change; someone making a huge scene about how long their food is taking; teenagers just hanging around with no intention of even eating there. I mean this is one of the biggest companies in the world, you think they could at least afford one security guard! Similar scenes can be found at the restaurant's tables. I remember they had clearly posted detailed \"no loitering signs\" and literally there were homeless people napping at the tables under them. I used to dread coming in here. Dos estrellas.
