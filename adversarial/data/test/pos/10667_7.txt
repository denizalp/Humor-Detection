I take responsibility for paying too much for the gun I bought from them but they have to take responsibility for price gouging and other unscrupulous practices.  I paid $1,749.00 for an AR-15 that lists for $1,249.00.  The salesman told me that the display model was the only one they had left (they have a lot on their wall now), that I would probably not find one anywhere in town, and that they couldn't even get any more. Further, he said that the sales price reflected their normal markup.  I was not familiar with the M&P or its cost.  So I agreed to pay the high price if I could return it if I decided I didn't want it.  I found another one in town that the store had not inflated the price on and bought it.  So, I took the first one back to Black Rifle Armory but the owner refused to take it back.  He said he had a no-return policy even though it's not posted and his salesman told me I could bring it back.  When I pressed him he said he would have taken it back the day after I bought it. What difference would a few days make? I will never buy another gun from this store and recommend that you don't either!
