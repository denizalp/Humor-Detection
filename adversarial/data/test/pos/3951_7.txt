I was really expecting to fall in love with this place. When I called them and asked what types of feta cheese they had, the woman who answered the phone corrected me and said, \"It's pronounced fay-duh.\" I'm Greek - I know how to pronounce feta correctly! But not only that, it's a little rude to correct someone's pronunciation...\n\nI got feta cheese and kalamata olives, thinking that this would be a fantastic way to save a trip to World Harvest in Urbana. The cheese was very low quality - it tasted like it hadn't been in brine for a long time, which is really important for feta! The olives were \"meh.\" We decided the trip to World Harvest is worth it, but we'll keep Cheese & Crackers in mind for the future.
