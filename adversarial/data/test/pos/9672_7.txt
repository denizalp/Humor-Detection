I don't really like meat. In fact, I eat meat so rarely that I'm practically a vegetarian. And on the rare occasion that I do go carnivorous, I tend to prefer chicken. Well, I am here to inform you that I tried Fuego's pork dish, their signature pernil asado, and it was so very delicious. I'm talking moist, tender, pork with some seriously heavenly flavor. \n\nSo yeah, Fuego has that going for them. They also have good service and a cute little patio. But this restaurant is in the weirdest location and I've never seen it busy. In fact, on all three of my visits, the place was practically empty. I also am not super interested in the majority of their menu options. They do have some tasty drinks, but their menu is lacking basic options for those of us that aren't quite up to par in the foodie world. \n\nAnyway, if you're looking for something a little different with a delicious pork option, then this is your spot. Try a mojito and have some fun.
