40 years ago this was probably a nice theater. Now it would have to improve to be considered a dump. I took the kids here on our last\ntrip to Vegas. I got the impression that the place had been closed since 1972 and just reopened without any cleaning or maintenance.\nThe urinals in the mens room were all marked out of order. I went directly into the drain in the floor (I guess you didn't need to know that). The snack bar did have sodas and popcorn,and the popcorn wasn't bad. We went here because I wanted the kids to know what a drive-in movie was like,since all the drive-ins in NO Calif are long gone. If we ever go to a drive-in again it won't be this one.
