for such a hippie, animal-loving town, madison really doesn't have a good selection of kennel-free boarding, so we decided to give waggin' tails a shot. i really wanted to like this place because the facilities are nice and their rates are reasonable, however...\n\nwe took our 14-month-old rottweiler in for a personality test of sorts, which is standard. i'll admit my dog is a little jittery, but she's a rescue and she's been through some serious shit... considering that she would go all cujo on strangers when we first got her, she's come a long way! she loves other dogs, but is a little tentative around strangers.\n\nANYWAY, apparently she was not fit for the kennel-free boarding. ok, fine. we decided to kennel her at night and put her in daycare during the days over the weekend. before her stay, the lady at the desk suggested that we bring her in for a few days of doggie daycare so that she could get used to the place. when we picked her up those days she was always super thirsty, like they didn't give the dogs any water. red flag number one. \n\ni had a hard enough time agreeing to kennel her this weekend, but when we came to pick her up yesterday, the woman at the desk didn't charge us for the daycare we had scheduled. when i asked about it, she made some remark about how whoever checked us in didn't put it on the bill and she didn't want to run our card again. ok, maybe i'm just too jaded, maybe she was really just being nice by not charging us for it... but i smell bullshit. if it wasn't on the bill, that probably means that my dog was sitting in a kennel all weekend. NOT. OK. \n\nmy suspicions were confirmed when they brought frannie out to the reception area from the kennel area (instead of the doggie daycare area). on top of that, she was hyper as hell when we got home - which does not happen when she's actually been at doggie daycare. \n\nbasically, this place is a scam and if you care about your pets, don't take them here. SHADY. end of story.
