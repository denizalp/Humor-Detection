Okay... so I'd definitely consider myself 'a local girl'... comin from Oahu... BUT roller coasters I la la looooove!!!... and sadly... we don't have ANYTHING cool in Hawaii. (EPIC FAIL for that!)\n\nSooooo of course I had to hit up the New York New York in LV to ride the roller coaster... and for those of you hatin on the $14 (one ride) tab... you're in VEGAS remember?! EVERYTHING is expensive... that's why it's a tourist trap!.... I mean you'll prolly pay $12 in Hawaii for a alcoholic beverage in a pineapple... that would prolly cost you $5 back home... same principle! In any event, they also have an all day pass for almost $30 and you can get yer thrills as many times as you can stomach!\n\nI LOVE ROLLERCOASTERS. LOVE LOVE LOVE em. This one is AWESOME! Lots of twists, turns, loops, speed, etc! As the rating states... woohoo! As good as it gets!
