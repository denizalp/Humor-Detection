Came to this place based off recommendations from coworkers and creeping on a local (Phoenix) friends yelp page. I was lookin' for sushi! But in the Wild West? Doubtful I'll find any worth writing about... \n\nWRONG! \n\nWalked in and it's packed! Good sign, as there's another all you can eat sushi place within walking distance. So obviously this place is worth it. But what's this? A minimum of 40 minute wait? Dude, I'm hungry and again, expectations are low. Fresh fish prepared properly in the middle of the desert? Yea right.... again: WRONG!\n\nSit down at the bar, and a delightful woman attends to me.... speaks Japanese, is Japanese. But what's this? Get to talking and come to find out, she's from Okinawa!!! Itoman to be exact. Those of y'all that know me know I lived in Okinawa for 6 yrs. And I'm very familiar with her hometown. Then she turns to the gentlemen that is referred to as 対処, the main and obviously head sushi chef, and tells him hey this guys from Okinawa! Well go figure, he's her husband, and guess where she's from? Yea. So not only does this Japanese restaurant have actual Japanese people preparing the dishes, but they are fellow islanders, what a cool surprise. And I'm not being prejudice or anything, but don't you get excited when you walk into an Italian joint and find that it's actually owned and operated (and the cooks) by actual Italians?!? Yea, well I like sushi places to have sushi chefs that are actually from Japan! Anyways... \n\nThe menu is full of everything from rolls to nigiri and sashimi! But there's hidden gems there, mainly, OKINAWA SOBA! Yuuuup! I ordered it, and it's REAL! Just like Hamaya Soba in sunabe! Go figure, with actual Okinawans working the joint. And, for those of you that drink (I do NOT and did not) they have Orion! Yup, the only Japanese beer exclusively made and owned and operated on the tiny island of Okinawa. What a rare find that was. \n\nThe lady and the man talked the entire night and you could tell they were thrilled to have someone come in that knows there homeland. They were both so friendly and so delightful. Very much like the people of itoman, the area they are from. \n\nThe sushi was AMAZING! I ordered 4 pieces of nigiri and 2 rolls along with my soba. Before I was done I had to order another 6 pieces of nigiri. It was that good. But be warned, if you come to eat like I did, bring your wallet. Now I'm not saying it's overly expensive, in fact I found it relatively fair priced. But as you already know, good sushi, real sushi, isn't a fast food cheap meal. Please understand that. Your paying for quality, freshness, presentation and all that, and that's what you'll get here, along with good conversation. \n\nIf you're with a group, grab the tables. But if you're in a party of 3 or less, sit at the bar and talk and interact with the expert gentlemen that are preparing your dishes right in front of you. \n\nThis place is a for real 5 star joint. I will absolutely go back anytime I'm in the Phoenix area. And if you are in the Phoenix area, make a reservation and go check this place out. You will not be disappointed. \n\nDat sushi mayne!
