This is the second time we have been to this library and BOTH times my daughter has tried to get the required Book for School & they are \"out of stock\".\nWhen going to the computer to look up the book details-Given these options: It list \"other\" location(s) that have it, the \"on holds\" (wait list) for this particular location & offers another option for YOU to reserve it. We had requested this prior and were never contacted?\nToday, when we were in we dealt with the same issues- put this book on hold & are hoping to receive an email letting us know when the book will be in.\nThis place always seems to be busy, maybe that's WHY they never have enough volume available. Supply & Demand: with ALL the schools here in Gilbert this place needs more to offer students within the district!
