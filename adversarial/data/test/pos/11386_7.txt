This place is pretty high class. Definitely not my usual choice for dinner because I'm poor, but my friend had a food voucher so we got a pretty good discount. The restaurant looked kind of small from the front, but there are multiple rooms and levels inside. The service was exceptional. I feel like there were more waiters than tables. We were waited on by like 5 different waiters. The one waiter recited the whole menu to us and made sure to roll his r's...rrrrrrrrroasted. \n  \nWe started with bread and butter. The bread was fluffy and fresh. For a high-class restaurant, I expected high-class butter, but instead they used packaged butter. A small plate of salad with honey mustard dressing preceded our main course. I ordered the Pollo Mallorca, which is chicken breast stuffed with spinach, raisins and pinenuts in this gravy-like sauce. My order came with a side of Spanish rice. The sweetness of the raisins really added a unique kick. The chicken was a little tough and overcooked though. The sauce tasted like gravy. I think I enjoyed the rice the most--perfect texture and spices. \n \nOverall Mallorca was pretty good, but the food wasn't really worth it for the high prices. The service was excellent though...they even clean up your breadcrumbs and scoop your food for you. It was kind of excessive, but if you want to be treated like royals...Mallorca will pamper you.
