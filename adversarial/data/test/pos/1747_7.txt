Excellent Food & Friendly Services!! Beware the place is small and doesn't take reservation. There is only maybe 10 tables, and they are small & efficient. Thus, if you have a large group and\/or with small children, be sure you go earlier because you maybe waiting for a while. By the way, there is no so-called \"waiting area\". Just a small vestibule or wait outside...(meaning it's going to be cold when you're there during the winter season.)\nRegardless, the food is wonderful & fresh, and the service is also wonderful. One other point to mention is that the menu is small, not a large selections. However, everything is great and come with love.
