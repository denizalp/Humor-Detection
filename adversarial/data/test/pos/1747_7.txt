Wow, um food was disgusting. When you take a bite of the burger 70% of the taste is grease. The strawberry milkshake w\/butter not good at all. The decor of the place looks like you've walked into a Troma movie from the 90's. Very creepy. Theres a large screen above the kitchen playing corny music from the 80's and next to it is a fox news or CNN news report about the people who have died at the heart attack grill. Thats very cold and wrong. Avoid this disaster.
