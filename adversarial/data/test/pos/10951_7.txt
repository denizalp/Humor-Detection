I feel silly even having to review Primanti Brothers.  Come on - this legendary landmark (even though it has several locations, each are a landmark in my opinion) speaks for itself.  \n\nI almost always order the Capicola and cheese.  If I've had a few drinks, and it is past midnight and I find my way to Primanti Brothers I usually will order it with an egg on it.  But the older I get I find myself there at much more reasonable times!\n\nThey claim that they are \"Almost Famous\".  I'm here to say that Primanti Brothers IS FAMOUS.  I mean, come on, Sophia Vegara just tweeted a photo of her Primanti's sandwich to her million + followers.  Primanti's has been on the Food Network God knows how many times.  Drop the \"Almost\", Primanti's, because you Are Famous.\n\nThe original location is in the Strip District but you can find one almost everywhere now.  Oakland and the South Side are probably closest to the \"authentic Primanti's\" atmosphere other than the original location, while the newer franchised Primanti's in locations like Monroeville or Harmar are much more of a restaurant type experience.  I like my floors greasy and my sandwich with fries and slaw.
