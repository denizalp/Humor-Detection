This place was started by the former CEO of Hooters which is not at all surprising. I guess he figured that scantily clad servers with enhanced boobs is a concept that can't fail as long as there are men in this world. And maybe he'd be right, if it was located in an area that didn't have so many other places that offer equally attractive servers, better atmosphere, and better food. \n\nUnfortunately, it just feels like Twin Peaks is trying too hard. While the waitresses are attractive, I didn't see any real effort being made by them to interact with the clients. The food, while better than Hooters, is nothing special, and my order of fish tacos came out of the kitchen far too fast to have been made from scratch which leads me to believe that the food is prepared elsewhere and likely just warmed up or microwaved at the restaurant. \n\nFinally, the atmosphere is supposed to be like a hunting \/ fishing lodge, but with such a giant building, it really felt more like a warehouse with some outdoors memorabilia stuck to the wall. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong and the chain will be a huge success, but I just wasn't impressed. With all the competition in the market, Twin Peaks really doesn't differentiate itself in any meaningful way.
