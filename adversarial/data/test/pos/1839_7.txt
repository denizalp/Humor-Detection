Came in here not knowing what to expect! But what can I say, very excellent customer service. Had Shawama and it was amazing! Nizan the Manager great guy and makes you feel like you are the best customer. \n\nNice and dim with alot of seating so great for groups. Lots of flavors and familiar names. So if you wanna eat and relax i suggest to come here.
