Kudos first: Great beer and wine. Super fun, energetic and cozy scene. Mega plus for allowing puppy dogs on the patio! I love enjoying happy hour or a late night chat here with a drink in hand and fellow urbanite at my side.\n\nOn the edible side, I haven't been enthralled with the food. I can't say I've had anything that tasted awful, wasn't cooked all the way thru, or had some kind of body part mixed in that didn't belong. But for a vegan, there aren't that many options. That's no surpise for Phoenix, but what options I do have aren't impressive. The fact that the portabella buger was NOT included on $5 burger night is discouraging. Is that some kind of subtle hint that meatless crew are not welcome here?\n\nI'll come again, but I probably won't plan on eating unless it's a side of fries. If you've read any of my other reviews, you know that no matter what, I'll always eat the fries.
