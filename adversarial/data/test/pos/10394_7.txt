Oh, that spaghetti. It's the most unassuming thing on the menu--nothing fancy, just house made noodles with tomato sauce and basil. Completely simple, and totally delicious. It's worth coming to Scarpetta just for this one dish ($24). If you're sharing it, they'll split into two perfect servings that are big enough to enjoy and small enough that you can still order other stuff. \n\nI'm getting ahead of myself, though. Before you get to the spaghetti, enjoy the dark, modern, understated ambience. If you're lucky enough to be seated by the window, you'll be able to catch the Bellagio fountain water shows. \n\nThe bread basket they being is not your run-of-the-mill sort of deal. There's a serious assortment of delicious options (the rosemary focaccia is amazing!) served with mascarpone butter, eggplant caponata, and citrus-infused olive oil. \n\nThey have a nice selection of wine, including maybe a dozen options by the glass. Didn't have much experience with their cocktails, but the old fashioned that my husband ordered was way too sweet. \n\nBesides the spaghetti, other menu highlights were the asparagus, which was cooked perfectly, with an egg yolk vinaigrette (hollandaise-esque, but not too heavy) and capers, and the creamy polenta with truffled mushroom fricasee--so flavorful and umami. The polenta was so loose it was a little difficult to eat without dripping all over, but the buttery mushroom goodness happening way more than made up for that shortcoming.
