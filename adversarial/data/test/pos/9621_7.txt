We stayed here for seven nights in March 2014 in a luxury suite on the 30th floor overlooking the strip.\n\nThis hotel has luxury and efficiency off to a tee, suite was excellent with 3 flat screen TV's, desk in the corner allowing direct access to the suite wi-fi and has a printer with paper and ink to print your tickets to shows and attractions which you can get cheaper by completing the bookings on-line rather than using all the \"outlets\" throughout the shopping areas.\n\nThere are over thirty places to eat in this resort with the Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian open twenty fours a day. You will not starve as the portions are huge and the prices cheaper than I expected, the Grand Lux Cafe was good for all meals throughout the day. Every restaurant we ate in I consider outstanding.\n\nWith over 160 shops & boutiques nobody misses out on the shopping front. The casino will never disappoint whether you are a gambler or a novice with bets from 1 cent upwards.\n\nIf you want 5 star luxury, convenience, safety, professionalism and a once in a lifetime experience then stay here, it truly is in a class of its own and we visited every hotel on the strip to compare it. Second would be the Bellagio and third the MGM Grand. Do not believe the people who say three days in Vegas is enough, we were there for nine days and saw about half if we were lucky. An adult playground that is only as expensive as you make it.\n\nThe Venetian is definitely my favourite and is highly recommended!
