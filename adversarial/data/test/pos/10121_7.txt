This is a quick break from the regular Las Vegas hubbub on the strip. Bellagio takes the time to craft wonderful, seasonal exhibits for all hotel visitors and I'm impressed each time. From a winter wonderland with moving penguins and artfully crafted Christmas trees with so many different flowers \/ colors - it's a perfect photo moment. Definitely recommend checking this out each time you're in Vegas!
