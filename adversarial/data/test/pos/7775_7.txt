BLD has impeccable decor, excellent food and top notch coffee. I was the only patron on a sleepy Tuesday mid-morning, and had an excellent experience. Polite and friendly staff quickly served me, and weren't overbearing. Dishes aren't overflowing with extras as you might find at other places, but were perfectly filling without making me overstuffed. Love the clean, black and white decor. Will definitely return on my next trip to Toronto.
