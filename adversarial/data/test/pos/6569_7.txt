A few of us decided on having my birthday dinner at the Prime on July 3rd since we all had a hankering for a really good steak and lobster.  Scotch 80 Prime was conveniently located in our hotel at the Palms.  With no reservations we were able to get a table immediately.  The restaurant decor has dim lighting...very romantic!  Not only did this restaurant become our new favorite but to top it off we saw a few celebrity sightings!  We were served the complimentary bread that was warm and had a nice cheesy taste.  A round of old fashions to start the birthday toast!  I ordered the asparagus, and mashed potatoes to share along with my main course being the lobster.  Also ordered was the rib eye with a side of \"special sauce\".  The entire dinner was oh so tasty and very special, I'm so glad that I had my friends with me to share the experience.  The manager sent over a \"Happy Birthday chocolate\" which I thought was a nice touch!
