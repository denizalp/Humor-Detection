Decided to try this place out for brunch and was incredibly disappointed. The bench of the table we were seated at was covered in food crumbs which I had to brush off myself--mild annoyance, but okay, not too big a deal. Then they brought out waters with cucumber wedges in them, which normally is a nice touch, but the water was so terrible that the cucumber couldn't save it. Thankfully though, I had my own water, so I could overlook that too. \n\nLooking over the menu we decided to try the brunch special which includes a meal and a beer or mimosa for $10. We waited a while for the waitress to come by, and when she finally did, she wasn't very personable at all (didn't even give us her name). We put our orders in, and when the drinks came out, I noticed the rim of my mimosa glass was covered in lipstick smudges. Gross! We got the waitress's attention and she went to take care of it, but the second one she brought out was also dirty, not only with lipstick, but also some weird brown crumbs stuck to the glass. We asked if they had just wiped the glass out, and she said that they had made a whole new drink, but that it's really dark where they do the dishes so sometimes you will get lipstick on your glass, as if that's somehow okay or to be expected? No thank you!\n\nAt this point I was so grossed out that I couldn't make myself drink it, and was weary of eating anything there at all, but since our order was already in, I decided to soldier through it. \n\nThe food when it came out was mediocre at best (OHSO Classic and Quiche Lorraine); the only part I could say I actually enjoyed was the potatoes. \n\nAfter the meal, we had to wait a while before the waitress brought the bill, and when she finally showed up, we asked to talk to the manager. We told him about the dirty glasses, and all he could muster was a pretty insincere \"oh, sorry about that.\"  No offer to take the untouched mimosa off the meal or anything. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back again and will stick to the Big City Bagel place next door. I hope for these guys sake that they learn how to properly wash their dishes and handle customer complaints, or else I don't see them being around very long.
