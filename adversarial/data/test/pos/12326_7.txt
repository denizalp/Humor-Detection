I remember wanting to come to Green Garden for lunch one day last summer only to find out that takeout and delivery were their only options at the time. The other night, Kay didn't feel like cooking again, and luckily, GG delivered to Beechview. \n\nI'll credit them for a speedy delivery. The food came in less time than the operator stated. \n\nThe story of the meal lies in the octet of gigantic and graciously filling fried dumplings. How the cooks wrap these pot stickers around so much ground pork remains a mystery, but their delightfully doughy composition and deep gusto is unquestionable. If I'd only had the dumplings, GG would easily garner a grade of 4 from me. \n\nI did not sample Kay's Shrimp and Scallop with Garlic Sauce, but the Happy Family was as dysfunctional as the Bluth clan...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v7oBAnEmklk\n\nThe advertised lobster was non-existent,  the crab was merely flavorless,dyed whitefish, the chicken was dry, and the roast pork was scant as were the scallops. The veggies were in abundance, however, and the fat prawns popped in my mouth. So yeah, this gathering was a little awkward. \n\nThe Beef-On-A Stick could have been a joy...if it was properly tender. I hadn't gnawed on meat this tough in years! I almost spit it out since my jaws were sore from chewing it and had half a mind to de-skewer the other slab and feed it to the dogs! It's a shame since the meat itself was marinated beautifully and pungently in what I assume was soy sauce, but the marinade failed to break down the meat. \n\nThis Garden is browned-out rather than Green.  I won't be ordering from them again.
