I was thinking about renting at this place later this year. I liked the floor plan and price.\n\n I called the management office many times for the past week but no one ever answers the phone. So i emailed them using apartment guide website that i was going to be there at a specific time on Monday.  \n\nI arrived on time and observed the neighborhood is very ghetto. A liquor store across the street and a shady hotel next door. The only thing missing is a group of wife beater wearing thugs hanging outside the liquor store. lol i guess it's too hot for that. \n\n I went to the locked door and no one was there in the office to let me in. I pressed the call button and no one answered. I called the phone number again but surprise, surprise... no one answered the phone.  I bet the manager is in the back closet of the office banging his mistress. lol\n\nI would avoid this place if you like good customer service and a management office that actually answers their phone. \nPlus, avoid this place if you don't want to get mugged just walking down the street. But if you do get stabbed, maricopa medical center is just down the street. lol
