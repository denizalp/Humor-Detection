Wow! All I can say if wow. I had this for the first time on Friday and it was the best soul food I've ever had.\n\nThe chicken was amazing, the sweet potatos were great, the mac and cheese was perfect and the red velvet cake was the best I've had.\n\nThe only complaint I have is it's too close to my home in Phoenix. That's like putting a crack addict next to a crack house! \n\nAll kidding aside, the portions were huge so remember that one meal could actually feed two adults. You won't be sorry.
