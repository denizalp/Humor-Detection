I've been torn about my review of Giada for a couple weeks now.  There were some HUGE highs and some MAJOR lows of my experience there.  I will appologize for the length of this review, in advance. If someone from management reads this, I will be glad to discuss further.\n\nI was traveling for work and having dinner by myself.  I stopped into Giada (2 weeks after opening) and asked how long the wait will be and if i could just find a spot at the bar.  The manager at the front of the house said that the bar was being used for overflow, and that the wait would be about 45 minutes to sit.  I agreed and went to play some blackjack at the Cromwell.\n\nAfter about an hour, nobody called, so i went to check.  Upon arriving, the hostess said that I could be seated.  On my way to the seat (which ended up being at the bar), she offered to give me a tour of the restaurant.  She showed me the house made pasta, the kitchen, the bread, and other areas,  I was very excited to feast.\n\nAs I sat at the bar, i ordered a McClellan scotch.  The bartender then gave me an iPad menu.  As I was looking through the menu, i only saw Antipasto dishes.  I asked if I could see the complete menu, and was then told that only antipasto is available at the bar.  This was not explained to me, and I was even led to believe (due to the tour and conversation with the hostess) that the entire menu was available.\n\nAfter looking at the menu for 15 minutes, I decided I would not eat there because I did not just want antipasto.  I asked for the check, but the bartender, Katie (who was amazing) asked me to please stay and said the would find the manager for me.  She also said that she would bring me out some antipasto dishes while I was waiting.\n\nThey brought out some big antipasto dishes, and I will admit that they were quite good.  There exceeded my expectations, and I was happy I stayed.  Finally as I was eating, the manager did come out.  He then went to the couple next to me, and asked them if everything was OK.  They said things were fine.  I knew he was supposed to ask me, but because I look young and was dressed in a T-shirt, I think he decided to ignore me.  The bartender then gesture to him that he was supposed to be talking to ME,  He then asked me if everything was OK.\n\nI explained the situation to him, and told him I really wanted to try the food from the full menu.  I know that he has made this exception for people in the past from talking to the bartender (and that is why she called him), but he decided not to budge for me.  He gave me some BS excuse and I could tell he was just not being very genuine.  It honestly would have been better for the restaurant to just not even had him come see me.  He basically offered nothing and then left.  He said he would get me a free drink, that never game\n\nSo, why 3 stars?  The bartender, Katie, is AMAZING,  She made a terrible experience great. If not for her, this would have been a 1 star review.  She is an asset to Giada.  She only charged me for the drinks I had and didn't charge for the food (since I didn't even want to order it).  Obviously, she got a large tip.  If the manager didn't come out, this would be a 4-5 star review.\n\nThe manager that came out was terrible.  He treated me with little respect and deserved to make this a 1 star review.  The management is a liability to Giada, and she should rethink who is running the customer facing team.  In addition, they should explain the the full menu is not offered at the bar.\n\nI will go back to Giada, sit at a table, and try the full menu.  For now, this experience left me in the middle.
