I've stayed away from this place like the plague because of the not-so-flattering Yelp photo of the under-cooked chicken displayed prominently on their yelp page. When Shake Shack finally opened up and I saw the infamous restaurant right across the street, the smell of fried chicken and happy patrons lured me over. My husband and I finally went in (I never told him about the raw chicken so he could go in unbiased), and we were greeted warmly by the cashier. I didn't catch his name, but this guy was on top of his stuff - greeting, taking orders, serving orders, cleaning up tables, checking in on customers, all without a hitch IMO. He gave us great recommendations - he said get the wings and get the creme soda, and that's exactly what I'm going to do now every time I come here (I've been dying to come back since my first visit). The BBQ chicken sandwich we got was just okay and kind of soggy, so I really do think the wings are the best way to enjoy the chicken here. I loved the chipotle honey sauce and the wildflower honey. It reminds me of the chicken and honey at Brooklyn Bowl, without having to drive down to the Strip. Their thin cut fries are addicting and I liked dipping them in the chipotle honey sauce as well. My husband opted for the gravy fries - which I thought were good, but soggy, but he loved them. I don't even like creme soda, but the brand they use here is a must-have! They also have TVs if you'd like to catch a game here. Not the ideal set-up for game watching, but it does the job. \n\nMy advice - give this place a chance, you might be pleasantly surprised.
