Genuinely confused how this place has received such stellar reviews. \n\nI'll be frank: service is good, the food is MEDIOCRE. Very very mediocre. The short rib and pork belly are the highlights of their entree and everything else is simply not worth the money (I've tried 5 entrees). \n\nMy opinion: way better food for way better prices at OTHER establishments. The Black Sheep is definitely a disappointing place.
