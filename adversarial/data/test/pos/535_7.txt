I have a better experience with Yuva so far. I bought their Laser coupons for my underarms. On my Ist treatment i took my little daughter with me. She couldn't go inside the treatment room so i left her in the waiting area. One of the staff lady actually played with her while i was in plus dd's bag of toys got ripped so this lady gave her Yuva's own recyclable bag.\n\nAs for treatment it went fine but after 3 weeks i saw not much shedding. A lot more hair than expected grew and never fall off. So i called them for re-touch n even though they don't encourage touch ups they still accommodated me. i'm happy so far. Thanks.\nI do have one complain though. All other places i buy coupons from (and i buy a lot of coupons) charge GST  only on discounted price but Yuva is the first one charging GST on original price. this thing really bothered me and i'm not sure if its right.
