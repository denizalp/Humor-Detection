Originally, I wanted to go to my FAV ramen place (raku ramen and izakaya). Little did I know, THEY'RE FOCKING CLOSED. GONE. IM SO UPSET LIKE WHY MUST ALL NY FAV RESTAUrANTS LEAVE ME WHYYY. COme back Come back!!!!!!! ! \n\nAnyways, enough of that. I went here instead to satisfy my ramen craving. For the most part, it was a relatively good experience eating here. I liked the fact that you can choose from 3 different soup bases (fish soup, hokkaido pork bone soup, and vietnamese style beef soup), whatever type of noodle you want, and whatever toppings you want. It's fun to customize food AYYYYY So yeah. I decided to get:\n\n1. Pork Bone Soup with Red Miso Ramen\n2. Japanese ramen noodle \n3. Japanese Style Chashu and their Chef Papa Fresh made Fish Puff\n\nPretty good. Soup was flavourful. Not too salty and not too bland. Ramen noodles were pretty good (a little hard though). Chashu could have been a lil better though. And the fish puffs, meh I didn't really like it. It was too squishy? Mushy? \n\nI came here with my mom and she chose to get some pho noodles. LEMME TELL YALL . THEY WERE VERY GENEROUS WITH DEM NOODLES. HER BOWL WAS EVEN BIGGER THAN MINE. I WISH THEY WERE JUST AS GENEROUS WITH THE RAMEN NOODLES D;\n\nOH YEAH you can get a drink from Preso-tea for just an extra $2.5 with your meal which is pretty cool although I must admit I'm not a huge fan of Preso-tea. I am still very much in love with Coco and NOTHING WILL MAKE MY LOVE FOR COCO GO AWAY NOTHINNGGDJSIANS \n\nBUT YEAH!\nOverall good place and it's definitely worth a try. Gotta mention though, I'm not too happy with their service. The workers were all so quiet and indifferent when they were with me and then when they were away from me (and other customers ofc) they were talking up a storm. So loud too like dang. Not that I want them to do small talk with me or anything, but I kinda wished they would've spoke up a lil more (go from volume 3 to at least volume 6 mate) YALL FEEL ME ?!
