Been waiting for a spot that does excellent yakitori, serves quality sake and opens late for when a steaming bowl of ramen would hit the spot.\n\nShokunin is a welcome addition to the Calgary food scene. Led by Darren Maclean, formerly of downtownfood, the scene is pretty inviting with an open kitchen and bar up front to watch the techniques used in cooking up your food.\n\nHighlights on a soft opening night included octopus fritters, succulent chicken thigh and heart skewers and a \"unagi\" style pickerel don which was a surprisingly delicious adaptation in support of the sustainable approach to the menu.\n\nLooking forward to slurping on the ramen in the future. Will be coming back many times for drinks and skewers of meat.
