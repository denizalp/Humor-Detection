Don't want to take no for an answer. \nLike the previous review. This is for the one in the Whitby\/ Oshawa area.\nA lady rang our doorbell, we were busy and not interested so didn't answer. She again rang, didn't take note of our lack of interest and so started banging on the window, indicating she expected us to answer her. An action that scared my young son.\n\nI am not impressed at all.
