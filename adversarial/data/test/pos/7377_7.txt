I went to Cafe Mix today with my mother and friend for the first time. WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK. The male manager at the ordering station was arrogant and unaccomodating. We asked for a \"to go\" cup for our iced\n tea and he said \"they don't do that\". However, during my meal I noticed 2 other customers walk out with a \"to go\" cup. When my gyro was served to me by the overly tanned female server, I kindly showed her my receipt that I had paid for a side of the cucumber sauce and didn't receive it. Her exact reply was \"you'll get it\"! The gyro sandwich was very greasy. Sandwiches do not come with a side. Next time we crave greek food, we will go across the parking lot to Bellagio's next door.
