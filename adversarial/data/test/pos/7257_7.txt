There are sushi snobs everywhere. Sushi in Phoenix? Ha. At least that's what I used to think. Sure it's easy to look down on everyone who thinks they've had good sushi after eating at Ra, or Zen 32 - but forgive them, this is Phoenix and they're still learning about sushi and that's okay.\n\nWhen they're done having bad california rolls and a happy hour menu full of pieces that fall apart, take them to Sakana in Scottsdale. I know, I said Scottsdale but don't let that turn you away. Sakana is away from the cheesy old town and located in a non-descript strip mall on Hayden just east of Scottsdale Rd. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be surprised at how awesomely fresh, clean and flat out delicious your food will be.\n\nIf it's just you and a friend, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar and not only watch the sushi chefs work, but actually talk with them. While there are a few who would prefer not to say anything, there is usually at least one who's up for anything and definitely up for you buying them a cup of saki.\n\nThe lunch and happy hour specials are excellent here. Order lots and try everything eventually. It's all good.\n\nWe used to live deep in Phoenix at 36th st & McDowell and we'd make the trek to Sakana simply because anything else was bound to be sub-par. Sure Zen32 was practically in our front yard, but we'd simply keep driving.\n\nThe ambiance is everything you'd expect for being in Scottsdale except you'll notice that families come here. You'll see groups of friends both old and young eating and drinking - all without the pretense you'll find down in Old Town. This isn't the sushi restaurant to be seen, this is where you go if you want the best sushi you can find in all of Phoenix.\n\nIf you grew up and Phoenix and the first time you had sushi was during a Zen32 happy hour, graduate and get over to Sakana in Scottsdale.
