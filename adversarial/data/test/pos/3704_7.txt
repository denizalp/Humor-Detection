I went here with a friend who was looking for some cabinets to put into an out building.  My jaw dropped when we walked in the front door.  It's packed with kitchen cabinets, vanities, some home entertainment systems, bathtubs, counter tops, doors, windows, office furniture, etc.\n\nMost, but not all, of the inventory is used.  Some of the wood products had scratches but none of them had any serious damage so I suspect they're picky about what they take in.\n\nMy friend was able to buy two kitchen's worth of cabinets that matched.  He plans on painting them.  They sell kitchens in full sets but they also have individual cabinets for sale in another part of the store so if you just need a base cabinet for an island you'l probably be able to find it.\n\nOf course their inventory will change frequently because they rely on donations but it's worth checking out if you're looking for something.
