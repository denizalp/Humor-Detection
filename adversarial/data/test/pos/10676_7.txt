seeing that my buddy-soon-to-be-married is completely devoted to his fiance and made me promise him no strip clubs in vegas (good church boy), i had to pull out a different trick when planning his bachelor party. this was definitely my first PG rated bachelor sendoff. \n\nmy boy, the bachelor, being the big geek (but good guy) that he is, was always ranting and raving about how much he wanted a segway. well, after first thinking of buying him one, i did my research and found those bad boys selling at $4,500 used and $6,500 new. sorry to my friend, but i'm a \"baller on a budget\" (woot woot, shout out to Trung N for use of his coined phrase). \n\nquickly, i modified my research on segway purchasing to a segway tour in vegas. i easily found \"Segway Bob\" through a simple google search. it was really easy booking with him as i contacted him about a month before the bachelor weekend and confirmed again the week of. he graciously provided a couple more segways than we had originally reserved and met us at our hotel on the strip. we had 10 total guys in our group. \n\nbob first let us test out our rented segways in the parking lot of our hotel. probably after 15 minutes, most of us were all comfortable maneuvering these fun machines. very intuitive and none of us fell with the exception of one dude who was trying to do 360 degree spins too fast. \n\nonce we were acclimated to our new cyborg legs\/wheels, we zipped out onto the crowded strip with our dorky helmets and machines. the amount of attention we got was kinda embarrassing at first as we would hear comments like: \"what is that, an asian scooter club?\" but generally, the countless comments were like, \"look at them. that looks fun.\" i may have blocked out the more negative comments though as a result of the practice i had in doing the same in high school. ha!\n\nwe rode the segways on the sidewalks and back alleys of the vegas strip. even when on crowded sidewalks with pedestrians, we were able to easily maneuver our machines and go at very manageable speeds. like i said, using segways are very intuitive, and people actually give you more space because of the wheels and they don't want their toes run over. \n\nalong the way, we had a race or two, and segway bob, took us to little known vegas spots on the strip such as the MGM mansion where the casino lets its highest roller stay. something crazy like 50 rooms, wait staff, as well as its own chef, cellphone tower, and an indoor pool shot in a lot of movies. never would've noticed. \n\nall in all, the bachelor and the rest of his buddies had a great time even though we all looked like total geeks. \n\ni very much recommend segway bob's las vegas tour. you can also choose to tour old town vegas instead of the strip. \n\nrates start at $85 per two hour tour (still worth it), but if you have a big group like ours, bob will work with you to put together a discounted group rate. \n\nvroom vroom!!
