The cocktails at Rose.Rabbit.Lie are superb. The entertainment is superb. The food...well, it's overpriced and mediocre at best. \n\nAfter seeing the menu online, I knew immediately that I'd be ordering the Short Rib Stroganoff. I spent all day dreaming of this dish, only to find that once the dish arrived, there was hardly any food on the plate. I rubbed my eyes, and still, there were 3 little specks of food. I realize they serve small plates, but even Barbie could've eaten this dish and still been hungry afterward. $24 and still hungry after I ate? Not okay. The overall dish itself was \"meh\". I'm quite confident that I could've made this at home and given it some flavors to make it pop, and I'm a crappy cook.  Just a bit bland, and again, mediocre.\nFor dessert we had the Cookie Jar and S'mores. Save your money. I've had better desserts at IHOP. \n\nNow, the highlight of RRL are the entertainers and the live band. They were excellent!! From a jazzy lounge singer, a tap dancer, an R&B singer, and a hip hop dancer; you will be dazzled by the talent. Luckily, the great entertainment will help keep your mind off the fact that you already ate and are still hungry. \n\nI came. I tried it. Not impressed (aside from the entertainers).
