For the record, I only remember bits and pieces about my visits to the Palo, but I can say for a matter of fact that I love this bar. \n\nSure, it smells a little like pee. And yeah, there isn't a patio. And, nobody is in there. But when a group of drunk friends meanders in there at midnight, it is an oasis. Rarely have we run into other groups there and when we do, instant friends! Except for the guy that just wanted to buy weed. He didn't like me much after I told him he was barking up the wrong tree. \n\nPool table. Jukebox. Cheap drinks. Off the beaten path. \n\nThis place may have started as a joke love, but just like so many other great romances, it has blossomed into a real and true one.
