Look I want to give this more stars because the experience itself was really great but by far it is the Most EXPENSIVE place I've ever been in my life.  After seeing some friends perform at the South Point showroom last evening, we hit Michaels.  With its 15 tables it is normally impossible to get in but we roll in at 9:30 2 of us and we are only ones there.  \n\nSeated and presented wine list and Relish Bowl and breads.. You realize you're not in Kansas anymore Toto... Holy Crap... we settle on two house wines $20.00 and 22.00 only options respectfully. \n\nMenu mix of Italian & Steak... but having steak night before we go with \n\nShrimp Fra Diablo Appetizer $30.00 for 5 large shrimp in a balanced not spicy tomato sauce.  Fresh yes, tasty yes, and worth the price... thumbs down. \n\nFrench Onion Soup.. $22.00 large Touraine with covered cheese which is your standard Onion soup.  For this price point you would expect the greatest onion soup ever delivered..  Ummm hot yes, tasty yes soup at this price fails. \n\nLemon Sorbet now while he pours Dom Perignon over it nice touch. \n\nTwo Veal Dishes served table side with stuffed Tomato..\n\nVeal Francais $76.00  Veal  Saltambocca $76.00\n\nBoth Excellent no doubt on that but the price points simply don't justify the meal. \n\nComplimentary fruit plate piled high to the sky with various chocolate covered fruits also complimentary was excellent. \n\nService outstanding and Russ   and waiter were complete Gentlemen and excellent host. \n\nI know persons will pound me and say if you can't afford to eat there don't knock it for price etc...  Well I can afford it, and I simply don't see how paying $76.00 for a simply prepared dish of Veal is validated.  \n\nExcellent experience, good top quality food, service, ambiance untouchable. But I personally can't get around the price tag of\n1 Soup 1 Shrimp Appetizer Dish - two dishes of Veal, two sides and two glasses of wine with tax & Tip $360.00  Donald Trump I'm not... you want to pay these prices be my guest, I've experienced it once but simply can't justify the value.
