Wow!! Worst service ever!\nWell first off our waiter Shawn went out and smoked pot about half way through our meal. He came back and reeked of weed!! Then he forgot to get our drinks. Again, he was high. Then we had to go to the bar to get our waters refilled. Do you see a pattern here? Food was fantastic. Service was the worst!! Probably won't be back! At least at Olive Garden you get good service.
