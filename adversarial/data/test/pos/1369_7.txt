Great place to get your CCW permit. Class is about eight hours long depending on the size of the class. Many hours of instructional and informative information. A half an hour to go get some food and bring it back. Bringing a lunch will make it easier for yourself. Be prepared to sit in an uncomfortable seat for eight hours. Then a common sense and Nevada laws test is given. Last part is the shooting qualification. All and all this was a great experience. The teacher Geza was entertaining and engaging. Time seemed to go quick. Love the selection of guns available for purchase. Shooting range is nice, but the electronic target range selector should have instructions next to it. Not that easy to use if you never used it before. Glad a friend recommended this place!
