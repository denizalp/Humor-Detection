I'd never been to a Granite City before this visit. Apparently they are a regional restaurant & brewery chain.\n\nI came in for dinner one evening - and to try out a flight of brews.\n\nI sat at the bar and ordered the meatloaf - which was actually very good. If I was ranking Granite City only on my food experience - I'd give them 4 stars. But...\n\nI also ordered two flights of brews:\n\nThe Northern (American Lager) (4.4% ABV)\nPeel Off (Witbier) (5.5% ABV)\nPrairie Vixen (Hefeweizen) (4.8% ABV)\nThe Admiral (Pale Lager) (4.7% ABV)\nThe Duke (Pale Ale) (5.4% ABV)\nBatch 1000 (DIPA) (7.2% ABV)\nNemesis (Black IPA) (5.5% ABV)\nOktoberfest (6.1% ABV)\n\nI found all of the brews to be very vanilla - very average. Nothing about any of them got my taste bud excited. None of them were bad, just, well, average.\n\nThe service at the bar was pretty good.
