Really good food.  I had the Strawberry Chicken Salad.  It looked so fresh and delicious! I should have taken a picture.  The poppy dressing was light and there wasn't too much of it either. I tried their apricot iced tea.  It was okay, nothing special in my opinion. \n\nThe menu was really great and I was impressed with the wine selection. I am really excited to come back and try all the other tasty food! \n\nWhy did I dock them a star? A couple of reasons:\n1. NO art on the walls!  We are in the frickin Phoenix Art Museum people.  This should be a place to constantly exhibit art.  I've been in the store rooms, there is a ton of art that could be shown here.  Even better, allow local artists to display.\n2. It took 20 minutes to get our orders taken, 30 minutes to recieve our food and another 15 to get the bill.  Although our server was polite, the entire experience took much too long.  This is a place for a leisurely meal. keep that in mind.
