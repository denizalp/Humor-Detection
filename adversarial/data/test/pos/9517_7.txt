Super disappointed in this location of Kim Po. \n\nI came here today with a friend for lunch. Considering the fact that I saw this Kim Po was related to the one at Times Square (Richmond Hill) I was expecting the same service and similar food but this was super disappointing. I ordered the sour chicken soup without any noodles. By the time I was almost finished, there was a huge piece of plastic in my soup. \n\nI called the waiter over, he saw the plastic and told the female waitress to come over as she was the one who initially took my order. I asked her why is that in there?\n\nShe said: \"Oh! its just a piece of plastic...then goes on explaining how it got in there\"....seriously..I don't need to know that how it got in there...I just need to know if you're gonna do anything about it...No apology\/ No 10% discount \/ and just walked away was what I got...I was quite shocked...and disappointed at the same time...\n\nI asked for hot tea\/ I get cold tea....\n\nThis place was just wrong from beginning to end...
