Bartender here was RUDE!!!!  I asked the bartender for something simple; to make me a Shirley Temple with a shot of vodka in it.  He told me that he had never heard of that drink before so he would not make it.  I asked him if he heard of a Shirley Temple, he said yes.  I asked if he's heard of vodka, he said yes.  So I said, fantastic, then please put those 2 things together for my cocktail.  He flat out said no, he would not make it for me.  I took my group of 12 and left.  Will never go back with that type of service.
