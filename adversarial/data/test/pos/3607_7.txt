This review is for the casino only.  I find the Fremont to be one of the places that I generally avoid on Fremont Street.  It's loud, the machines are close together making the aisles a bit of a pain to navigate.\n\nThe other problem I have with the Fremont is there is no parking other than valet.\nDon't make the mistake of driving in off Casino Center Boulevard because you'll have to back out and go somewhere else unless you opt for valet.\n\nI was here to meet a friend for dinner and then I left.
