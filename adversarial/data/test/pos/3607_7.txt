I needed some tools and they have sales going on all the time so I dropped by. It was a good experience coming in here for the first time. While many think when they need tools they head on over to Home Depot you shouldn't overlook this place especially considering they are more focused on tools and the employees are ready to assist you at any time.\n\nI had a question on sink disposals and the older gentlemen there had 16 years of experience installing them and had great advice and described everything in great detail.
