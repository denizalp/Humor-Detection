I frequent their Phoenix location, and I love their food. Today, I was in the area of their scottsdale location so I thought I give them another try. I had takeouts here once and found the food at their Phoenix location little better. \nToday we ordered our usual beef chow fun and Tres Amigos. It was good but was little on the salty side. Also tried their seafood pocket appetizer. It was nice and crunchy on the outside and moist in the middle with ton of shrimp and scallops. It wasn't what I expected but it was tasty. \nOverall, I still prefer their Phoenix location. The staff was attentive and the restaurant had very nice and clean atmosphere.
