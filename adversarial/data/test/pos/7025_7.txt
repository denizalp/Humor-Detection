Every year I visit the mighty 216 to catch up w\/ old friends and attend the home opener of the Cleveland Browns' season.  My friends and I would usually meet at a friend's house but since his kids are getting older, we've found it best to move the party to a different location.\n\nThis year we partied at The Highlander.  You may have passed this place a million times and never paid any attention.  It's located on one end of a strip mall and seemed to be overshadowed by the brightly lit ice cream place a few doors down.  \n\nOn the outside, it looks small and dark but it's really not.  Once you go inside, you'll realize it's quite spacious (it's long, dummy) and nicely lit.  There are 4 flat screen TVs (viewable from any corner in the place, thank you very much), a smattering of gaming machines and a jukebox.  All your entertainment needs are satisfied.\n\nThe drinks are cheap and nicely poured.  Michelle the bartender is very nice and friendly.  The management immediately clocked us as newcomers and welcomed the entire party w\/ a round of shots which led to more shots and um... more shots after that.  Don't expect any fancy beers on tap or any of those highfalutin liquor brands.  This is not THAT kind of place.  You gotta problem w\/ that?\n\nMy buddy ordered mozzarella sticks and I had chicken tenders.  They were both tasty.  I guess their burgers are very good but no one in our party was that hungry to order one.  Maybe next time.\n\nEveryone in the place seemed to know each other but we (being the non-local crew) never felt shunned or left out.  As a matter of fact, we were quickly assimilated into the group and everyone had a great time.  Before I left, I gave Michelle a hug and kiss for being so awesome.  It was a beautiful night w\/ old friends, great people, cheap drinks and Ratt on the jukebox.
