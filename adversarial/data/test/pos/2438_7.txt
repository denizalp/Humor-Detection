I only went in to take care of a traffic ticket. They gave me a uniform and kept me for 2 days. The food is not the best and there's no coffee. With the food they give you it's no wonder the other patrons are passing some raunchy gas all day and night.   The servers wear police uniforms and they're really tough on visitors. So strange. Avoid this place if you can. At least they gave me a payment plan to take care of my ticket when I finally got out.
