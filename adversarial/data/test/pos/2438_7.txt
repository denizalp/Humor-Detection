Visited on a Saturday morning and was immediately greeted with sweet, friendly service and a smile (always a good way to start off your weekend!). Various pastries were available for sale by the counter. Drinks menu had good variety (they had your standard espresso based drinks, plus various tea lattes available), listed on a board behind the cashier. Seating is very limited (a couple of tables and some counter space) so not ideal for bigger groups who want to sit in and enjoy a drink. \n\nIf you walk down the stairs located at the back of the cafe, it leads you to boxes of records for sale to browse through downstairs. Very funky, unique shop that you should certainly check out if you're in the area. It's unconventional, and a welcome addition to an area serviced by mostly chain coffee shops.\n\nIn terms of its actual products, this ended up being pretty average to us. We ordered a) a hot chocolate and, b) a latte - both were just okay. I actually found my latte to be a bit burnt-tasting. Couldn't really appreciate the taste of the beans - I ended up dumping a whack of sugar in it to really enjoy it. The hot chocolate was also just okay. So as of our first visit, environment exceeded product quality. Perhaps we visited on an off day. \n\nOverall, and despite this, I really enjoyed the environment. It's very casual and I love the community, small-town vibe it brings to the heart of Port Credit, so I'll definitely be back to try out something else on their drinks menu.
