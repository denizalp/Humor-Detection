WORST OWNER EXPERIENCE EVER!!! KENNY IS A JERK!!! Called to ask him why, two days in a row, we had what I thought were bad experiences. Immediately, he starts screaming at me trying to justify his EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES and the fact that the bread that he puts his sandwiches on, should be served at a tea party, they are soooo tiny!! The guy will be out of business in a year GUARANTEED!!! Bye-Bye!!!
