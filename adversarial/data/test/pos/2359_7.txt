Nothing quite kills the holiday spirit for me like a trip to the post office in December. I hate dealing with the crowds of impatient people. And let's face it, impatient customers tend to be rude and that can make the post office employees less then stoked about dealing with you. \n\nYesterday I had to go to the post office to mail out some Christmas gifts. It was the day before the cut-off date to ship Christmas presents so I expected it to be a madhouse, and I pretty much spent the whole day dreading what was in store for me later. \n\nWow, was I in for a surprise when I got to the post office. The parking lot is small and if was pretty packed but I managed to get a spot someone else was pulling out of... I piled my boxes up and used my chin to keep the stack from falling as a made my way to the door... This is where a post office employee came to my rescue. Not only did he open the door for me, he then ushered me over to a machine where I was able to weigh and measure my boxes, print out the postage and pay (by credit\/debit card only). I was done in less then 15 minutes. As I walked out there was still a good dozen people in line, perhaps more. \n\nYou can use that handy machine til 8, even though the post office closes at either 5 or 6 pm, depending on the day. Major thanks to that post office employee for saving me so much time and ensuring I didn't lose my holiday spirit!
