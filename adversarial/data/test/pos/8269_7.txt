I know this review is probably not helpful but I need to get this off my chest:  If I see one more person walking around Yorkville with a TIFF badge hanging from his\/her neck, I'm going to Throw myself onto Bloor St., get flattened out by a car, stick a string through my ear hole and hang myself like one of those bloody ID tags off the top of Silver City Cinema.   \n\nWhen did movie watching become such a self-congratulatory event?  I know the festival does have a slight purpose for the industry but why do regular people suddenly line-up half-way across the city to see movies that are going to be released (and inevitably get panned) 1 week later?  There is no point, save for the slight spine-tingle one might receive by telling one's friends that they got into a film at the fest.
