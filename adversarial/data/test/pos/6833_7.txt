5 star customer service? No way! I'm sorry it takes me a couple minutes to look over your menu, but there is no one else in the restaurant... so am I really that much of a hindrance? I still tipped you, and you really want to give me that much of an attitude bagel man? Not even a \"have a nice day.\" Your sandwiches aren't even that good.
