I don't care what anyone says. This show was rad. The drinks were expensive (but in line with the rest of Vegas drink prices)and sure I could have used a full frontal flash or two, but one of the best things about Thunder from Down Under is the perfect walking the line of taste.\n\nThe guys were all ripped beyond belief and most actually had rather attractive faces as well. The host was the hottest and pretty funny to boot. The entire show was high energy good fun and at a little over an hour the show wasn't overdrawn or too short.\n \nA lot of horny women screaming in delight at the sight of some bare male-flesh really is my kind of Las Vegas.\n\n*yeah the 20 dollar fee to take a picture with all the guys was a bit steep but I got away with paying 15 bucks without getting attitude and the picture is worth a thousand words.
