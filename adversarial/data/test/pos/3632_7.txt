!!! I love sprouts and their produce but I will not be shopping here for anything else. I purchased soy milk and within 3 days of purchase, it had spoiled. The expiration date wasn't for another week. Wth??!!! Also I bought a ranch dressing and was disgusted when I opened it up to use on my salad and it was already opened!!! Ewwww!!! Gross
