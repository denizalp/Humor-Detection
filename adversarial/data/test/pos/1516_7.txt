A little on the top... a little on the bottom. Hop In Brew continues to be a steady fave when I'm in need of a brew with some buds.\n\nFrom Festivus with the yelpers in December to meetups and just popping in for a pint and some pizza, it has its own charm that just seems to keep growing on me.\n\nIf you're headed in, go early. Tables fill up quickly. Or, hang around the pool table upstairs. If you're lucky, you'll spot one freeing up soon enough.
