*Thumbs up*\nIf you're craving for moderately-priced BBQ in and around the Strip, then Rollin Smoke should do the trick. It's a hole-in-the-wall, underneath the highway, tucked in a tiny strip mall near Spearmint Rhino -- uh, yeah so you should have no trouble finding the place. \n\nI had the 2-item combo, with the brisket and spare ribs. I also ordered an extra beef short rib. The only thing memorable was that giant beef rib. Tender, juicy, succulent and slightly sweet meat that came cleanly off the bone.\n\n*Thumbs down*\nThe brisket was slightly dry, and the spare ribs were bland. It desperately needed some of their house made BBQ sauce, which is super peppery.
