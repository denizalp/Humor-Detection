Usually people from Ottawa go to Montreal and rave about the food.  However, if this is on your list of places you visit I bet that won't happen.\n\nI enjoy a few Mexican restaurants in Ottawa and none of them compare to this joint.  I don't say that as a compliment to this restaurant I say that because I've not had Mexican food this bland.\n\nI wasn't allowed to mix and match enchiladas which I found to be a bit strange.  I wanted a cheese one and a chicken one but was told I can only get two of the same so I ordered two chicken.   The dish came with a large serving of Mexican rice which was OK and also a garden type salad which was not very good.\n\nThe enchiladas themselves were very, very dry and the cheese was burnt.\n\nThe service was fast but the staff didn't seem to be all that attentive after they brought the food and instead I had to flag one down for more beverages.  \n\nThe patio is just the sidewalk with chairs and tables on it and nothing separates you from some of the more colourful characters who can be found on Saint Denis street so be prepared for interruptions!
