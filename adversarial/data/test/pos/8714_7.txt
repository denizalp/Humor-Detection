It was one of those nights when I crave for Tacos. So I finally decided to try Jefe's out based on fellow Yelpers and had it bookmarked for awhile. I even passed on having Filipino Chicken Adobo last night, even through my mom's adobo is \"the Bomb.\" \n \nAs I arrived at the Sinclair gas station based on the directions provided by Yelpers. I was able to locate the shop in reasonable time. There were a few cars in the parking lot that had occupants eating tacos or burritos. I knew that this place had to be worth visiting cause a good portion of the customer were heading or leaving Jefe's inside. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and immediately ask me if I found this place through Yelp. I responded with, \"Yes\" with my hungry looking eyes. I ended up getting combo #5 shredded beef tacos with 4 corn tortillas. Every bite was delicious and the beef was seasoned just right with pieces of bell pepper. The corn tortillas were simply delicious and doesn't have that aftertaste of preservatives. Overall a great place to grab delicious Mexican food with great customer service!
