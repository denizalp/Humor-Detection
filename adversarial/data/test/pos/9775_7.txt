I moved to the LA area and I miss this place so much. I just drove out there to visit friends and family the other weekend for the first time since Dec and this was one of the first stops I made. I had to stock up on my favorite Whey protein (Nature's Research in Banana aka Gains Manna of the Heavens). I am super excited to see that this place has DOUBLED in size since my last visit and they are opening another location on the west side soon. Good to see a great business doing well. Prices still slay the competition, online and offline- plus no waiting for shipping! I love you Discount. I miss you.
