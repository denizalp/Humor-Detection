I came here on a Friday night around 11pm. There was some pretty awful karaoke happening, & EVERYONE in the room was 4+shots over served. I'm not exaggerating, everyone was either drooling in themselves or falling over their own feet. It looked like an AA meeting gone wrong. \n\nMind you, this is coming from someone who works in the alcohol industry & knows how to drink & have a good time. This place is a shit show, & the bartenders need a lesson on how not to over serve people, because that's how car accidents & bad things happen. I won't be back.
