I booked a truck online at uhaul.com and after an email, a text and a phone call reminder, I arrived on time to pick it up. The person who helped me with the forms had a badge that said manager and he made it appear that this is something he's done a truckload of times before.\n\nEasy, pleasy. From the time I walked in until the time I drove off the lot with my rental truck was maybe 15 minutes.\n\nNow, if the trucks could be better, that would be awesome but I can't ding these folks for that. Maybe cruise control? Or a CD player? Or even a ventilated seat? When you're driving 1000 miles in two days, all of these things would be helpful. But at least the truck was clean and it was as comfortable as it can be, I suppose.\n\nYay! I'm a fan!
