I have been coming to Sushi Factory since a friend and I discovered it a couple months back. We love coming here for what is offered for the price as an A.Y.C.E. \n\nSushi Factory is a great  A.Y.C.E in my opinion due to the Daily Specials. There is a board next to the Sushi Bar with handwritten items of delicious deals that are not on the menu. These Daily Specials can be part of the A.Y.C.E. deal but one per customer, not table! A few Daily Specials that were offered were octopus, special rolls and salmon collar bone which was delicious!\n\nYou can order anything off the menu which is great. If you are not really into Sushi there are other items like fried rice, fried things, lettuce wraps and skewers. Everyone can partake really! Ordering a half roll is also perfectly acceptable here because sometimes all you want is a half roll to share with your table mates. Sometimes you just want to try and not devour a whole roll!\n\nThe sashimi and rolls are pretty fresh and very tasty. Now there are a  few items that I seem to re-order every time I come in. They are the raw oysters (2 per customer) and the salmon skin hand rolls- both delicious! Now there are a few items are not my thing like the baked rolls or the Monkey brain.  I was not to fond of the Salmon or Tuna Tartar but both are actually a good option for those wanting a non-carb (rice) option.\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful AYCE! And don't forget to get a stamp card for a free AYCE!
