I was forced to stay here because of a crappy American Airlines flight that got cancelled last minute when I landed at Phoenix Airport, which is usually a good experience, however not this time. The geniuses at the airport has the bright idea to resurface all the runways of all times now and backed up all the flights coming in that evening. I had to use a crappy voucher to the cheapest fleabag hotel they could give me. \n\nTheir shuttle was the latest of all the other hotels and had duct tape all over the seats. They don't even care enough to make a good first impression and that tells you all you need to know. \n\nWhen I finally got to the hotel the front desk manager who looked like Brian Cranston from breaking bad made me wait forever, was rude, surly and clearly didn't want to be there anymore than we did. The room was dated, shabby and falling apart with the drying hotel soap from the seventies. \n\nThe only good thing is I didn't have to be there that long and left early the next morning to get home. Won't ever stay here again and I don't recommend you do, unless your only other option is to sleep on the street!
