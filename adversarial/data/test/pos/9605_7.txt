Came here to get drinks and watch the game with my boyfriend. Upon arrival, no one was to be found. However, we walked over to the bar and we were able to sit anywhere we wanted to.\n\nThis place is really nice for a pub. Definitely much cleaner than other pubs in the area.\n\nOur waitress was kind, however the service was slow! The pub was pretty empty, only like 3 tables were occupied but she hardly checked up on us. Probably only once, because she went to give food to a table near us.\n\nI probably would be back if I'm in the area for drinks and possibly try their food!
