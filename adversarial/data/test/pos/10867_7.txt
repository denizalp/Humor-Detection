So Att: All vacationers, if you are golfer or ball player and you want to spend $150 for lunch beware! You cannot sit down and eat peacefully without the \"Hat\" cops asking you 20 times to take off your hat. It's one thing for your personal server which is fine, but people who are just  'y to ask was annoying! Prob last time eating here after 20 year's of being a loyal customer. If it was such a big deal, then they should have enforced this policy when greeted or before we drove 45min to get here.  Our server Liz R and Demetri were professional.. sounds like a COORP issue!!
