this place sucked!  dont eat here.  although ill say the name \"more buffet\" is appropriate as when u go to thier breakfast\/brunch buffet.....u want that--exactly more.  more food, more variety, more warmer foods.  what a waste of $20 bucks.  if u enjoy eating cat food and dog food, hell even lama food this is the place to be....not to mention if ur in the market for a lady (er...65+)...this is the hot spot.
