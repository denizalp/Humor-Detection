Came here for weekend brunch and it came out to a little less than 40 bucks. I stuffed my belly with crab legs and ate some other offerings they had but the crab is there best bang for your buck. They had a pumpkin panna cotta which was really good. The friend chicken wing was ok. Pass on this and eat something else. The dim sum is not great, very doughy. \n\nParking is only free for the first hour and they do not validate.
