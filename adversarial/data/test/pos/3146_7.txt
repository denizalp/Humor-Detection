i'm kinda surprised i am writing this. i know i wrote this review before but it says \"write a review\" so i'm going on memory. the food was great, we sat outside, table of 4, it was a beautiful day. i ordered the plantain spring rolls and the main dish escapes me. but it was fantastic. i was super happy with my food. i raved about it to friends. which leaves me perplexed why i am sitting here now 3 months later writing this review. lol. desert is amazing..so is the coffee. i'm not even sure why i have not been back since my last visit. :-\/ i need to get my shit together.
