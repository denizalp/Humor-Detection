In a nutshell, the biggest dining disappointment of our trip. I'll make this brief: The service was horrible, the selections from the menu were appallingly small, and the silverware was filthy. \n\nIn the Paris Hotel of all places! I asked for Beschemel and the server looked at me quizzically and stated, \"Uh, I don't think so, but we have Cholula and Tapatio if you want.\"  Why the f@#k would I want hot sauce in stead of Beschemel? That's like asking for gravy and being offered hot wing sauce. WTF?\n\nI ordered up an omelette that had to be sent back twice because it looked like it was made of burlap. The manager said they had a new cook, but you'd think a cook in Vegas could handle an omelette. \n\nThey had no French Vanilla creamer for coffee (mind you, this is in the Paris.)\n\nThey're lucky I can't give them no stars.
