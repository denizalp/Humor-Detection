Love Little Spice for great Pakistani food. This is a small restaurant with a place to order at Front and then eat there if you wish. There are a few tables. Maybe seven or eight?\n\nWe came for lunch and ordered one lunch special and one lamb biryani. To drink, a cold salty lassi.\n\nThe food was fresh, tasted delicious and I enjoyed every single bite. The meet was marinated with a delicate blend of Indian or Pakistani spices. Whoever is cooking here knows what he or she is doing.\n\nBetter yet, this is not a classy restaurant. You go here for good food. So it's a real treat. Also I like that it is on McLeod Trail just off of Southland Drive. \n\nThe staff was also friendly. The food came quickly, came hot and delicious, and the waiter brought us extra chutneys or spices because we asked.
