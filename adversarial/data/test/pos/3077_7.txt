Much like the other review, I had the same issue. Chris Griffin says he personally wanted to respond, yet I get a form email telling me I'm not spending enough money for him to even bother giving me an estimate. Great way to run a business, and I find it hilarious that he has the gall to assume any budget is set in stone.  Fantastic business model. I will be taking my business to someone who knows how to run a company and believes in customer service.
