A friend of mine from Europe came to visit me and stayed with me for the past several weeks. After visiting the Grand Canyon, Sedona and all of the other touristy things one does when you have an out of town guest, I decided to take him to Scottsdale Fashion Square for some stylings of the fashion and the crowd.\n\nWe spend some money on some clothes and he decided to get a new pair of shoes for a night in Scottsdale later on that evening. That is when we walked into this store. As we were already carrying plastic bags of clothes, it would appear that were there to spend some money and not loiter (I will add that he also had a Tiffany's bag, with a gift for his gf, which means nothing to men but the blue bag wets most women like a shower knowing that its contents is expensive).\n\nAt this point, the person working there looked us over and judged us as though we were not fit to not only spend money in the store, but shine any of the shoes. We wore jeans and collared shirts and not the kind with eagles and rhinestones or Tommy Bahama written on them. Dry cleaned, pressed well-fitted shirts. Somehow, our clothes were offensive. Maybe it was our looks, as he has very blonde hair and blue eyes. Maybe, her dog died. She was of Middle Eastern persuasion or maybe an overdone Hispanic escort, and maybe his blond locks were too Aryan for her taste, he is Danish, not German, but we were not fit to try on the shoes. Either way, she decided that her time was not worth our money to spend. We did try them on and after the second pair, my friend remarked, \"Do we smell? Why is she so pissed at us?\" He asked to see a third pair of shoes and he was told, \"We don't have that size.\" \"Are you sure? You know the whole inventory?\" She said, \"Look, I know what we have and what we don't have and you have wasted enough of my time,\" and asked us to leave. I said you must be joking and she said that if we did not leave she would call security. We left but not after my friend decided to float an air biscuit in the store.\n\nTake your business elsewhere. This place will surely be closed down sooner rather than later. I hope that the \"worker\" finds some therapy. In a manner other than gin and juice.
