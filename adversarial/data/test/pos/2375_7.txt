Good value for money and its location  (King West : where everything - including egos - is usually inflated!) . Fish and chips. This one had a good taste to it not bland, which was my biggest fear. Fish was meaty not greasy. \n\nThe coleslaw was real, not of the plastique astroturf type (I'm looking at you, Col. Sanders of my youth).\n\nThe takeout bag was chock full with condiments, napkins and kit. \nFor $10 + tax you are left completely full.\n\nAny plans for a liquor licence? I was thinking an ale would go well with it.
