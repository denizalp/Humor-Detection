A brand new Tim Horton custom built to be more modern and chic to fit into the newer image they tries to market.\n\nThe deco and seating options are good: single bar stools, moveable tables and chairs, booth seating and even 4 armchairs right by a fireplace in front of a tv showing CP 24.\n\nServices though lacking with staff acting like they haven't drink their morning coffee as yet....and I was here during afternoon break time.\n\nThere are though quite a few electric outlets available though if you need to charge up.\n\nParking can be tight as there are still new construction in the plaza.
