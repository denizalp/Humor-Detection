So let's just keep it real, it's Scottsdale what do you expect.?\n It is just like a reality show here, and I love it lol. At first I had an attitude as a self defense mechanism because I expected certain things to occur here at this gym for me being black etc. Me being a member here at Lifetime Athletic is like a grizzly bear being in Antarctica. I will admit it took me a while to become acclimated to the ways of the Scottsdallion. Just like a lot of you say, alot of women trying to hold on to the past, lot's of sexy workout attire attached with attitudes and look at me but don't look at me unless I think you are hot syndrome lol.\nBecause I'm black and I'm tall and I dress crazy I get alot of unwanted attention with dumb questions like what are you training for? What team do I play for? Am I in the NFL, MLB, or NBA. Kids come to me while I'm trying to shoot because they think I'm somebody. I can't even talk to any females here because other people will assume somethings going on because there is alot of scandalous things going on like people having affairs people sneaking kissing by the stairs over here over there. It's pretty much like High School here at Lifetime Gym but I still love it. If you join here you really need to be focused. I joined 4 years ago and only a few people even know my name because although I dress loud, I stay quiet. Sat mornings is great to come in for 5on5 hoops or 4 on4 half court. If you are single looking for a fit mate this is the best gym to join. And also past 11 at night is great to be here not alot of people and no distractions. If you love your kids know that the childcare should just be called baby sitting. They are just keeping your kids in a fancy holding cell until you come back to free them. Overall it's worth the money if you really want to workout and change your life oh and I love the cafe and the staff there as well. Can't forget my main man Craig at the front desk, he most def brightens up the place with his vibe, it's all about the vibes yo. Until Craig showed up I didn't have anyone to talk to. Everybody loves Craig even the children. He is like the cool principal at Lifetime High.
