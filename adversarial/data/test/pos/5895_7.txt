I have a love\/hate relationship with this market. If you survive the parking lot, and the millions of people trying to get the goods, then you walk away with great deals. Most of the veggies are fresh and amazing prices. There were some things that are a little more like the breads. They have a good selection of local honey at good prices. It is worth checking out if you are local and are willing to eat whatever they have that is good that week. I got a great deal on red peppers (5 for $1) and they were perfect to roast for my marinara sauce. The zucchini and squash were great as well. However, the yellow and orange peppers were no good.
