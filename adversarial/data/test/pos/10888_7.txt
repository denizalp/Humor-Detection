In reference to the GOODYEAR Location, this place doesn't even deserve 1 star!  Total rip off!  I went in to check out the facility and prices and told ANDREW at the front counter that I was in a hurry and I just wanted prices.  He said we have a special if you give me $10 I can lock the rate in until Friday....I said ok but I will be back by Friday if I decide to move forward.  He didn't give me a copy of a contract or go over any kind of contract with me.  He gave me a schedule and told me to pick out hand raps and gave me a keychain.\n\nAfter going home and doing some research I didn't like the reviews so I decided not to join.  I never stepped another foot in the place to initiate any kind of membership.  I figured I would just lose my $10 and that was that.  \n\nI decided to call to make sure that was the case and ANDREW happened to answer the phone.  He said he remembers me signing up and I was committed to 6 months!!! I said I will be right there and I was on my way. \n\nWhen I got there, I gave him the unopened hand wraps and keychain back and told him to cancel my contract.  He insisted that I signed the contract willingly and he emailed it to me.  I asked to see the email and it wasn't my email so again I had no idea I was under contract.  \n\nHe knew my intentions and tried to take advantage of me.  I told him he's a piece of sh** and he knows he's lying through his teeth.  I asked to speak to his manager and he said he is in charge.   If this place is willing to hold people to a 6 month contract over $65 per month they must be desperate.  I can't believe the arrogance of this clown.  Do NOT TRUST THIS PLACE TOTAL SCAM!!!
