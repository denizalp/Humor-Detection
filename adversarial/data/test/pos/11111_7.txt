Dog friendly patio, great happy hour, walking distance from our house, great service, and delicious eats + drinks? Yes, please! Kitchen 56 is a major winner in my book! The service is always very friendly and attentive! From 3-6 PM on weekdays they have a variety of $5.56 eats and drinks! \n\nI ordered their kale + quinoa salad for lunch {add chicken} and it was incredible! It was a VERY hearty salad and I was super full by the end of it! It is hard to find a good, hunger satisfying salad these days and Kitchen 56 definitely does not disappoint!\n\nThe fiance had the green chili burger and loved it, but I loved the hand-cut fries even more!!! They were so yum {sorry Ben P. for stealing most of them!}. ;) He secretly orders fries because he knows I love them {insert awwwwwww here}. \n\nWe'll be back to this fab restaurant in the 'hood very soon! Thanks for always being so great! Harvey {our sheepdog} loves the treats and cozy patio as well!
