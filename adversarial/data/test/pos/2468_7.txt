I had been wanting to try this place for a long time. I saw so many of my friends checking in, looked at the reviews and photos and thought the food looked pretty good. Big disappointment! This place was not very appealing to me at all. I had the bangers and mash. This is what most people talked about in their reviews so I had to try. You can't go wrong with sausage, mashed potatoes, onions, and gravy all wrapped tight in a crispy pastry right? Wrong...I was expecting something way better. It was gooey and mushy and it just didn't have the taste I was expecting. My husband had the Cajun chicken and he wasn't too pleased either. He ate all of his but he never likes wasting food so that's why his was gone before I could even finish my first half. He really liked the sauce that came on the side so I think that was the only plus for him. The only reason I face this place 2 stars instead of 1 was because the pastry was still pretty good. It was nice and crispy and fresh. I wonder if the will just sell me the pastry, that is the only reason I will ever go back.
