Horrible customer service from the Service Department! \n\n My vehicle has been in and out of the shop with nothing resolved. They never called to give me a status, I always had to call to check up on my  vehicle. There also was a time I had to go down to the dealership my self and point out the problem to a technician.\n\nAlso, beware of the \"AFTERMARKET WARRANTY\", it never seems to actually cover anything. \n\nThis will be my last vehicle purchased at Towbin.
