This is an actual conversation that took place in lane 11 one dreary Tuesday in October. \n\nBONNIE\n(Looks at six 8 1\/2 X11 certificate frames with paper inside that reads \"Certificate Of Excellence\") Alright, alright, alright... looks like someone has some congratulating to do, am I right?!\n\nCOREY\nActually I'm using them at an event next week, I'm printing menus and signage for this event and putting them in these frames then propping them up on tables for guests to read.\n\nBONNIE\nOh shoot! That's incredible, just incredible. You see that on Pinterest or something? \n\nCOREY\nNope. I just sort of thought of it. \n\nBONNIE\nWell you are something, really something. Who thinks I'm going to take this frame and it's going to be a menu. That's... that's just really wild! \n\nBonnie makes Kristen Wiig's Target Lady look lame. She's a friggin' hoot! I hope she's not seasonal because I'm at Target two to seven days a week and I hope her cheery demeanor and inquisitive nature continue well past the holiday season. The only thing that would have made my visit better, is if Bonnie busted out from behind her register and hoofed it to the home section to pick up a stack of frames for herself. I can almost hear her...\n\nBONNIE\nI'm having my friend Betsy over for brunch Saturday and I'm going flatten leaves and put them in these frames with our afternoon menu that I'm going to write out in cinnamon stick!
