Went here for Lunch, restaurant was also empty at the time. We went for the so called executive buffet. Service was extremely slow, took about 2 hours for lunch as they are that slow. Don't bother going if you are going as a lunch break during work. They claim its a buffet but you have to ORDER from the menu, so its more of a cook to order buffet. Portions are so small. We had a group of 10, ordered enough food for 10 but they just brought out 1 bowl of each item, ridiculous if you as kme.  It's about 30mins between reorders, Never enough bread or rice, kept having to ask for refills, water was always empty, wait time between food refills was ridiculous. To the point we just gave up. First time leaving a buffet HUNGRY still. Then another stupid thing is that you are limited to 1 desert, specifically 1 choice and no refill either, theres only 2 desert choices and you can only choose 1. Doesn't sound like a buffet to me. Also ordered a few items, server kept saying she'd bring it, but never did. I would never come back here nor would I recommend ANYONE to go here. They changed owners or name's recently as it use to be something else which had a full buffet line (much better IMO). Customer service is EXTREMELY POOR and the whole half ass buffet style they have going on is just a complete waste of peoples time.
