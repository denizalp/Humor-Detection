When my man and I are in the mood for Chinese take-out, we call up Food Express and drive over since they don't do take out. It's so worth it, more than the luxury of delivery. Movie nights would be complete if they would.\n\nI urge you to try the jellyfish appetizer! spiced and slightly pickled, its REAL GOOD.\nOur other favorite is the Honey Shrimp. It's like candy.\nThe only thing we didn't like so far was the Duck tongue in xo sauce. The bone inside made it really awkward to eat.\n\nSo glad to find knockout Chinese in vegas. SCORE.
