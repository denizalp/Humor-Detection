It's time for an update! I truly love ASU Gammage because they bring shows to the Valley that I love and the venue itself is a beautiful one to enjoy a show. ASU Gammage brings in a variety of shows, including Broadway Across America which are my favorite. I recently purchased tickets to see Dirty Dancing and Cinderella. Cinderella was by far my favorite and my seats ended up being really good! We were able to get in and out of the theater in no time and it's all because we arrived in a timely manner and left right after the show ended. I always look forward to a fun show at Gammage and can't wait for the to announce their next season!
