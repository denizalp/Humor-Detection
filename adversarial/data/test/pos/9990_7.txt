I despise everything about this place pretty much. Half of my experiences here have involved having to meet 1-2 of my friends here, and then getting there, waiting outside for 20 minutes before being let in, finding out my friends are on the third floor, trying to get up to the third floor, finding out I have to wait in line AGAIN to get to the third floor, getting up there after 15-20 minutes, and all of that just to be bombarded by bros, tackily dressed women and sticky floors. I apologize for that run on of a sentence\/story, but it perfectly describes my frustration with Wando's.  When I leave after all this, I feel drained from standing around for so long, and frustrated because that was about an hour of my weekend night wasted.\n\nConsidering that it's a bro bar, the drink selection obviously isn't too great.  It's bottom shelf liquor and mostly domestics, but with a few decent taps (i.e Blue Moon, Spotted Cow). The fish bowl is one of the main attractions for some patrons, but it just tastes like kool-aid, which is not what I want a drink to taste like.\n\nI don't have much else to say about the place. I will admit that Wando's likely does fill some niches.  For instance, it's probably a good place to hang out if you're looking for a one night stand with a college student. It's also fine if you want to dance to pop\/edm at a nightclub-esque setting without paying ridiculous drink prices, AND if you're possibly too homophobic to go to Sotto or Plan B. But that isn't me, nor is that the kind of person I want to associate with. So yeah, Wando's is a 1 for me, and I'd recommend most level-headed people to avoid being near there.
