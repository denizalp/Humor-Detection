First with the positves...The cheesesteak & fries from room service are very good, and room service seems to be quite prompt.  Good on ya kitchen & staff. La Village was decent, albeit really busy (30+min wait). I stayed in a Red Room...which I prefer to their suites, which tend to be dated and tacky.  The Red Room was as expected: very comfortable king mattress,  soft linens, 42\"-46\" flatscreen, and functional love seat and coffee table. The Red Rooms are on the top floors, so it is pretty quiet, minus the housekeeping carts and chatter. I wish I could comment on the gambling, but I took my action elsewhere because they kept screwing the pooch at every opportunity...please see below.\n\nNow with the other 95% of my stay...the staff don't listen nor care. \"Do Not Disturb\" signs are meaningless to the housekeeping staff, as they'll bang on your door at various hours of the day and night even if you have a DND sign hung. If they can't reach you after banging on your door they call you room. I asked if they saw the DND sign, and they said yes... but it is company policy to call. I had a migraine the size of China, and they weren't helping.\n\nA little while later I called down to the front desk and asked the manager (Eric) to please put a note on my account that I do not want to be disturbed, for any reason. He said he would \"take care of it,\" but housekeeping banged on my door and then called me again the next day. Today I decided to be proactive so I called to schedule housekeeping and make sure there was a note on my account saying \"DND\". They said yes...we will not call. Guess who got a phone call about 3 hours later, while dead asleep....?  I explained again that I did not want to be disturbed as I had a migraine and I just needed some peace and quiet.  That has to be the end, right? Less than 5 minutes later there is a BANGING on my door. I stumble out of bed and it is a guy cleaning my door. I point to the sign and he said, \"yes sir, yes sir. I am just cleaning your door.\" BANG BANG BANG the door rebounds off of the door jam. I stopped him and asked him to leave. \"I am just cleaning your door.\" BANG BANG BANG. I wish I was making this up. He just kept going, mumbling something I couldn't understand.\n\nThere was no hope of getting back to sleep, so migraine and all I walk down to the front desk to speak with the manager (Eric), again.  I waited 15 minutes for him to get there, and I swear it seems to get brighter and louder as each minute ticks by. He finally appears with a, \"What can I do for you sir?\" fake smile. He remembered me from the prior day, and he said that he made a note on the account, so he didn't know why I kept getting bothered. He said he would \"get this fixed.\" again. He reassured me that he left a note, so if they didn't do it, he did not know why. He channeled his best Don Quixote and said he would \"get to the bottom of this\", and he asked for my phone # so he could triumphantly tell me how he would save the day. I left my cell phone # and he said he'd call me back after talking to the head of housekeeping.\n\nFifteen minutes later I get a call, but Don Quixote was not triumphant and the windmill still stood; color me shocked. Even he couldn't claim victory, so he started listing reasons why he couldn't slay the housekeeping dragon. The list included: \"I tried to reach the Head of Housekeeping, but (s)he is at the other property, so I don't know what happened.\"  \"It is a different cleaning group, so they didn't know.\" \"It is company policy to call the room if the guest cannot be reached about house cleaning.\"  And on and on and on and on. \n\nI don't want excuses. I want you to fix it. I want you to be sincere. I want to try and enjoy what time I have left here. I do not want to hear what you would have done if the Head of Housekeeping was here. He finally said he was sorry about the hassle (carefully not accepting any blame himself, even though he failed to fix the problem the first time or the second time). As his grand gesture he offered a $100 dining credit.   Ruin my weekend for a $100 credit. I cannot leave here fast enough. Keep fighting windmill guys, as it is obvious you have no clue how to provide actual service right the first time. I am going to go to a real hotel like The Cosmo, Wynn, Etc.
