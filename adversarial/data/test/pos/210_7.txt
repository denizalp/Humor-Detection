Insanely expensive. Dinner for 5, without alcohol, was $320, and all we ordered were rolls, sashimi, rice, edamame, and soup, in reasonable quantities.\n\nI didn't realize until after we sat down that fried rice was over $30, and each roll (i'm talking your standard tuna avocado, not one of the crazy rolls) was pushing $20+. \n\nGiven the price point, I had pretty high expectations. Nope. The fish was fresh (but not like \"wow this was flown in this morning\" fresh), but the rice was overly mushy and too cold, so the consistency was far too sticky; it reminded me a little of rolls that a grocery store puts out after it sits there getting far too cold for hours on end.\n\nThe apps (soup and sashimi) were nice, the rice was good, but not worth anywhere near what they were charging. When we got home, we had sushi at our spot in Hoboken, $45 total for two, and it was significantly better than this.\n\nThe atmosphere was gorgeous and the staff was amazing, but the prices were nowhere near justifiable for what we ate.
