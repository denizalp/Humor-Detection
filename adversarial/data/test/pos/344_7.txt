I've actually never been inside Saffron, but since my sister-in-law is seriously addicted to their food, I've had take-out from Saffron about 10 times. If anyone has the number for an Indian food addiction hotline, please fwd it my way - I'm kinda worried about her...\n\nShout out to the samosas, the naan, the chicken tikka masala, and the saag with paneer cheese - those 4 things frequently put me in a food coma after church on Sunday. For an extra punch, order the entrees spicy for a quick sweat before your nap!
