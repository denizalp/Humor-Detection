I am way, way too excited that a Pinkberry opened up in Vegas.  Now all the desert dwellers can get that California stripmall experience.  Mani\/pedis and fro-yo, ya'll!\n\nBut, DAMN THEM, they don't serve salted caramel, my favorite flavor.  Of all the places to pour salt on ice cream, Las Vegas should be number one! But, noooooo.  \n\nHowever, in a pinch, the pomegranate flavor works.   Add some pineapple, mochi and granola, and you'll be in heaven.  Prices are pretty good too, considering it's right on the strip.  About $5 a pop.\n\nP.S. - It's in front of the Mandarin Oriental, not inside.
