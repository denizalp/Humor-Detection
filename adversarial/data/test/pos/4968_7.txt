You Take Your Chances Here...GREAT BASIC BREAKFAST, Otherwise So-So Cafeteria Quality Food.\n\nI have been eating at Randy's off and on for several years now. I just want to temper the reviews with some reality about what to expect...\n\nInitially I ate breakfast only, and generally the same item, #8 (2 eggs, two bacon or sausage, hash brown or country potatoes, and toast). They learned to cook my eggs perfectly, my bacon crispy, and my country potatoes crisp and with onions (the hash browns are tasteless and not crisp at all). I also occasionally enjoyed Randy's Breakfast, substituting a waffle for the short stack of pancakes. I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs, but the chicken fried steak was soggy (not crisp) and pretty tasteless, and I tried their corned beef hash, which was very salty and tasted canned. That was easily solved by sticking to my favorites, which have been consistently excellent.\n\nMorning service was always GREAT! They have wonderful staff, ALWAYS make you feel welcome, and work to ensure that your order comes out correctly and QUICKLY. They are super fast and super attentive!  \n\nThat said, as long as I stuck to my familiar breakfast items, I was on very safe and tasty terrain. \n\nFast forward to my more recent experiences since older (much) friends of mine have encouraged me to venture beyond breakfast at Randy's. \n\nI haven't had anything from their lunch or dinner menu that was better than average - at best - but often sub par. I'll give them props on their mashed potatoes, but the commercial gravy is awful, and I can't speak well of anything else except that their seasonal daily specials are only $5.50, and that buys a great deal of forgiveness for so-so cafeteria quality food.\n\nIf you are not that picky, you will be fine, but there is nothing remarkable for which to be here after breakfast unless you just want to fill up. \n\nI don't object to the lack of ambiance - the staff more than makes up for it - service trumps all. I also have no quarrel at all with their cash policy. It isn't as if Randy's is pretentious. I wouldn't compare lunch and dinner here to home cooked food, unless you expect food overcooked, and a great deal of the home pantry to be filled with processed ingredients.\n\nAfter such great breakfasts, I was seriously let down by the rest of the menu.  I'll continue to return for the things that I love, and leave it at breakfast.
