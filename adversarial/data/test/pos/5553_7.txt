I haven,t eaten at Pei Wei in a while because I didn,t really care for it the first couple of times but I decided to give it another try. \n\nOur luncheon visit was not inspiring but adequate.  We ordered the Honey Seared Chicken and Mongolian Beef, both entr√©e's were good. Both our  portions were ample and  had a good flavor.  The Honey Seared Chicken was all white meat and included rice sticks, scallions, and red peppers. The Mongolian beef had scallions and mushrooms. The entrees were okay for a fast food establishment. However, the brown rice was not cooked thoroughly and lacked any flavor\n\nPei Wei is a fast\/casual concept with moderate prices. It is not a destination venue but if you are pressed for time, you could do much worse.
