This place does not honor the 50% off offer for ordering online. I was trying to order online but since I live in a new community (less than 1 mile from their restaurant) our address doesn't show up on their system. What a bad service...I'm sure there is a way to honor the 50%off on their register but Manager said they can't! Amazing how they'd rather loose business. SMH.
