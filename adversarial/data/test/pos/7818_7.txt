I've been to Dillion's a couple of times and will keep on coming back for more. The first time I was there I ate on one of the high top tables in the bar area and ordered a Brisket Sandwich with fries and a soda. I think I spent about $16 with the tip. The Brisket sandwich was ginormous and delicious. The fries were excellent along with the service from the bartenderess (okay I just made up a word that should be added to the dictionary).\n\nThe second time I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was meaty and tasty as well. I came in with some out of town family members and they ordered the fish tacos and ribs if I remember correctly. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Sorry Dillion's - my picky wife was hard to please. But the guy driving the car chooses the restaurant.\n\nAlso. sign up with your phone number for some discounts on your next visits.
