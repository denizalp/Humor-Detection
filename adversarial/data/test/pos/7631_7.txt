***This place is a thrift shop***\n\nMe: (Picks up cute charmingly tacky martini-emblazoned flannel pajama sleep set and takes it to register) \"Excuse me, ma'am - how much is this?\"\n\nEmployee: \"Fifteen dollars\"\n\nMe: (Picks jaw up from floor) \"I'm sorry, WHAT?!?!\"\n\nEmployee: \"Fifteen dollars\"\n\nMe: (Incredulously) \"I'm sorry, did you say fifteen dollars?!?!\"\n\nEmployee: \"Yes. It's a great deal because they are brand new.\"\n\n\nI can get cheaper nightwear in retail shops by simply utilizing my super-excellent bargain hunting instincts. Or by freaking cruising a Target on the weekend. So I left. I didn't stay more than 5 minutes. \n\nFrom what I saw, they were well-organized though small, but the woman attempting to convince me to pay retail for crappy jammies whilst in a thrift store was too much. But I can't give one star to a thrift store run by a religious non-profit. I'd probably burn extra hot in hell per God's request. Yeah, she'd be pissed.
