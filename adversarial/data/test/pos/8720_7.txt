I've always loved this place because it doesn't feel like you're in #LasVegas exactly! Yet, a quick #Lyft of #Uber to #TheStrip and back so you can drink, safely! #Bars\n\nThe large pool is fantastic for laps or free play! Lifeguards and there's a beach area that kids play in all day! The lazy river really is chill. #Bars Perfect temperature most times, yummy drinks in the pool if you want and lifeguards.\n\nTwo hot tubs; 24\/7\n1 for adults (way down past the lazy river area.) And the 2nd is next to the beach-sand section of the large pool. \nBora-Bora: By far the best room situation for our family (because it's spacious) a beautiful tropical condo feel, with a full kitchen, laundry machines (don't always work, check before hand). A nice large living room area & couch (couch bed) & soft chair. There's also a table for 4 in living room. Countertop bar with barstools. Placemats, silverware, pots & pans, grilling tools, plates, sm. Plates, bowls (cereal size), cups, glasses, wine glasses, a coffee machine, microwave, toaster, sink & dishwasher! Laundry closet in kitchen area. \n\nWe just bring some items from the local grocery store (don't forget condiments!) Such as milk, rolls, burgers, hot dogs, butter, bread, drinks, coffee (your coffee), meals to cook (don't forget there's 2 huge grilling area's that are very well kept & maintained. Sundays Luau! They have tons of activities for you and your kids! Send the kids off to make a cool art project with other kids! Yay! #Wine4MommyTime There's a Denny's in the same parking lot. There's also a restaurant\/bar on property. There's a small gift shop that is very pricey for dumb things like cigarettes or ketchup. A pack of cigarettes is over $10.00 and you won't get your brand. \nWe have had people complain about us being \"too loud\" and we were not being loud. That's called sex. If you expect to never hear anything through hotel walls, surprise! Security got that dumb complaint and came to bother us to \"try to keep it down\". Shout out to that guy for NOT getting anything but jealous. Boom! People have sex in hotel rooms, you guys! Bringing curious children? Ask your reservation agent to put you next to other families with kids. It'll decrease your odds of sex noises making you...angry. \n\nI love the deck outside to smoke cigarettes or just chill. I use something that's garbage for an ashtray until I leave so there aren't cigarette-butts all over the property! Be polite, put them in ashtrays or garbage! Just sayin.\nOverall this is my very favorite place to stay, so far out of every place I've traveled! That's a huge compliment! It's like being in Tahiti or Hawaii at times. The airplanes going overhead don't bother me. Staff have always been friendly to me and my family. Never really had any big problems here (I've stayed there at least 20 times now). #Definitely CheckitOut
