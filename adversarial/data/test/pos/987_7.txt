Honestly, I think this place is way over-hyped just because it is the newer of the clubs in Vegas. I do give the place props for having an amazing outside area though. The lights, pool, and overall atmosphere really reminded me of a smaller version of XS. They did a really good job of keeping the girl to guy ratio high. Flocks of girls would be strolling into the club in the beginning. \n\nBut seriously, is it REALLY necessary to have girls in 4-inch heels walk up 5 flights of stairs before being able to get into the club?? The design of the entrance was definitely not optimal, they could have had an elevator at least, and the stairs were the janky aluminum looking kinds they have in emergency stairways. My feet were killing me by the time I reached the first level of the club. Then of course you want to explore the rest of the club, so we ended up walking up 2 more flights of stairs to reach the top, so you could only imagine how much pain we were in.\n\nAlso, I think we came on a really bad night. ATB was playing, so the club was especially packed, not to mention that it was 97 degrees the entire night. The combination of people bumping into me left and right and being all sticky and sweaty due to the weather left me with a pretty bad experience and memory of my Saturday night at Marquee. Maybe I'll come again on a night that won't be as packed.
