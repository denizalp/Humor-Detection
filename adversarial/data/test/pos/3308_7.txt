I can't figure out which is more sensationalistic: WPXI or WTAE. \n\nI'll say WPXI. WTAE isn't as much like Fox News as WPXI is, but they've still got the overhyped local stories, and the bimbo\/airhead anchors. \n\nI think men watch just to stare at Shannon Perrine. \n\nOh, on an elementary school field trip, I got to sit in weatherman Joe DeNardo's empty chair. \n\n\"Joe Said It Would!\"\n\nUs kids would add, \"But It Didn't\" since he was way off half the time.
