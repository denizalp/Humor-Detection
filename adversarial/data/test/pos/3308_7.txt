I'm a fan because I'm a sucker for good food and good beer.\n\nMy friends from China came into town (former Las Vegans) and we were on a mission to squeeze in as many new bars, clubs, and restaurants as humanly possible into the few days they had in Vegas. Carson Kitchen was an immediate destination. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Simon the restaurant. But Simon the person is a pretty cool guy (met him once) and he's following me on Instagram and Twitter. Just saying. ;D\n\nThe plates are small-ish and the menu is designed w\/ a social aspect as its intended to be shared. This is great for us because we believe in sharing and want to try a little of everything. Not a lot of one thing. One of my friends is Jewish so we didn't try anything bacon. There are a lot of kosher items on the menu--in case its worth mentioning. We went with the following:\n\n-Tempura Green Beans ($8): Delicious. Fresh green beans battered then deep fried. How could this possibly be a bad choice. Cream cheese dip was tasty however it could have been served softer\/room-temp. It was a little difficult to dip the beans w\/o breaking. \n-Broccoli Crunch: ($10): Crunchy (but not too crunchy) broccoli in a green goddess sauce. This is delicious and done really well. Refreshing and the perfect pair w\/ the rest of the heavy menu.\n-Baked Mac & Cheese ($12): Again, a classic that can't go wrong. Noodles aren't mushy. Cheese is rich and has the perfect texture. \n-Short Rib Sliders ($14): The only thing we didn't like! The bun is good; I have to give them that. But the short rib root beer glaze is so sweet it kind of spoiled the slider for us. It's TOO SWEET and rather unpleasant. We ate it but wouldn't order it again.\n-Wild Mushroom Flat Bread ($10): Another delicious option. Lots of mushrooms, carmelized onions, and crumbled bleu cheese. These are perfect for sharing. Next time I want to try the spicy sausage one. \n\n3 people + all that food + 3 beers was plenty for us. I think I spent around $90 + tip. Not bad and definitely a place worthy of entertaining guests. This is the perfect spot for a GNO or FNO. Get a few people together, kick back and chill while you get small bites + a few beers\/cocktails (full bar). I'll be back!
