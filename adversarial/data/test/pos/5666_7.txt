Happy birthday to me - \n\nI think that I have died, and reincarnated into a sweet toothed person. Seriously, it's that amazing. two of my favorite things to eat - ice cream and hot chocolate. If you knew me, you'd know that I like cold coffee on cold days, and hot coffee on hot days. I know I am a walking oxymoron, It's just wrong. \n\nDefintely order the frozen hot chocolate, but DO NOT ORDER THE DEEP FRIED OREOS, THAT IS FOR THE MINUS STAR.. You have to make everything good, and it was DISGUSTING! \n\nBest of all, this was my birthday cake without the cake! YEAH FOR ME, I hate cake!!!!
