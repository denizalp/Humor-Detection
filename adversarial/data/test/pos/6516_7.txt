I would give zero stars if possible. Four mix-ups before we could even make it to the table. Staff was rude, unhelpful and uninformed. We flew in from Detroit and made reservations over a week in advance to ensure a memorable evening. It was memorable, but definitely not a positive one. We will not be back. I recommend going to Top of the Rock instead.
