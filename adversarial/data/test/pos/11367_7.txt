Okay... As a vegan I will never feel comfortable eating here again. My mom and I were in downtown Summerlin yesterday and we were excited to grab dinner here. They had vegan options on the menu... And having tried the tree hugger at the downtown location last summer... I felt compelled to order it again... But lo and behold... A VEGAN falafel started calling my name. I was totally torn. I asked her if they had any nutritional Info for their food. They didn't. I then asked if the treehugger was vegan... I was told it was but they use mayo in the aioli. Good to know because the downtown location told me the sauce was vegan and safe, it clearly isn't if they are using mayo. She then went on to inform me that they fry the vegan falafel in the same oil that they fry their chicken in. Um... Wait what? I had to ask her how this was even possible... And why on earth they would have the nerve to use the word vegan in anything on the menu that was being cross contaminated with animal products. In all fairness... The ingredients uncooked are vegan... But the second they hit that fryer... They are contaminated with fat and oil and enzymes from chicken. It's vegetarian at best... And using the word vegan is a lawsuit waiting to happen (anyone remember the Mcdonalds French fry catastrophe?) I had a salad from here at the beer fest that was most definitely vegan... And it was sooo good. Unfortunately... I will never be eating here again, at least not until they learn proper vocabulary or create a separate fryer.
