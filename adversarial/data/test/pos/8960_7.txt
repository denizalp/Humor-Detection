Move over cupcakes! There's a new nut in town... a doughy one at that.\n\nJelly Modern Doughnuts is a new take on an old treat in C-town. Gourmet doughnuts that you just aren't going to find elsewhere. S'more, carrot cake, red velvet, raspberry, peanut butter, banana chocolate... I came home with a box of real lookers. You can bet I tried I bite of each one. The chocolate banana is where it's at for me. Like a deep-fried ring of banana bready goodness, it'll have you slipping away into doughnut delight.\n\nPrice-wise, these big bites come in at $2.25 apiece. \n\nAnother treat by the counter, an array of a dozen doughnuts, all themed for Easter. Custom orders! They even come with a clear tray on which to display them. My oh my, you've just raised the doughnut bar. Good thing-too many more of these and I won't fit under it anyway ;).
