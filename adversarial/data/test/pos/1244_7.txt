I would give this theater five stars if I didn't have to walk through the Suncoast Casino's smoke to get there.  Other than that, I frequent this cineplex because it's conveniently located in my neighborhood, shows independent films, and sells kettle korn--my favorite, and not available at the Regal theaters.  I am definitely a cinephile, usually seeing a film every weekend, so this place is like a second home and I recommend it if you like any of the factors I just mentioned, especially the indie film part.  For this side of town, it's either this theater or Village Square that shows indies.  Now that you know, pass the popcorn and turn off your cellphone ;)
