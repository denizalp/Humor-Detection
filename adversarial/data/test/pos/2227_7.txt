This place is a great option when given the choice of the food court nearby. Usually shop at Arrowhead Mall for clothes since they have a better selection than PV. This is the last Chevys in town since they closed the rest of them.\n\nI love the Sizzling Fajitas at this place and that is what I always order. It is really good and comes out on a smoking hot plate making all sorts of fun noises. The meat is always tender with a lot of flavor. The wife usually gets the Fajita Salad with the Sizzling Chicken.\n\nReally like their homemade tortillas that used to come out of a niffy machine off to the side. Not sure if that machine is still functioning any more. Looked like they could have been made by hand this visit. OK with me.\n\nThe menu is rather large with lots of choices. The Chips and Salsa are definitely a score. I would recommend staying away from the standard items such as tacos, burritos, etc. There are too many great hole in the wall places around town with the authentic stuff for cheap.\n\nOur server did a great job although he seemed to be overworked with too many tables. Saw several other servers just standing around. The manger even seemed a bit out of sorts as he paced the floor back and forth. Even saw a bit of the Seinfeld nose episode. Was it a scratch or the pick? Good thing that sizzling fajita plate is hot. Â¡LO SIENTO!\n\n3.25 STARS
