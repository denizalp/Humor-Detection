Very rude sales person on the floor very rudely told my three year old child that riding the child's bike that was on display was not allowed and physically stopped her from doing so while myself and my husband were standing right there. She did not offer any assistance and rolled her eyes when I displayed my disapproval of her talking down to my child. Will not be returning to this location and possibly REI entirely.
