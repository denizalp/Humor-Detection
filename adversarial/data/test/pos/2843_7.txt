More like 3.5 stars.  It's better than your average Vegas buffet, but not as good as the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, and The Orleans (YUP!).  It also got bumped up half a star because they had good crab legs.  In fact, my friend injured a finger and squirted crab juice across the table as she devoured those meaty legs.  We all went primal.  I was cracking em with my teeth and smelled of crab for the next 12 hours. The choices were abundant, but I suggest staying away from the pasta section.  Made to order dessert crepes were available, but I was hoping for a savory selection as well.  Lots of rich sauces covered chicken, beef, pork, turkey, and seafood.  Not bad.\n\nIt's $25 for dinner and the wait was over an hour.  Not worth the wait, but we had vouchers, so of course, we waited.
