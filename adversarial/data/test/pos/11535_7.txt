Spoon House is a great place for lunch. I love the Mex-Asian fusion bugolgi burritos as well as the the traditional options on the menu. The food isn't the best Korean food I've eaten, but it sure hits the spot when I'm craving some bi bim bop. \n\nIf you have never tried Korean food, Spoon House it's a great place to start. The menu is full of popular Korean dishes, and if you're not feeling adventurous, the burritos and tacos are a great alternative.
