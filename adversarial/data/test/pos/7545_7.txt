So many bowling centers, so little strikes. Having numerous bowling alleys which are open 24-hours is one of the under appreciated advantages of living in Las Vegas, and I have bowled at several of them. I am not too picky, nor am I a bowling expert. I am thrilled if I break 100, and I will probably wet myself if I ever get a turkey!\n\nThe Suncoast alley is one of the 24-hour options in Vegas. It has more of a homey feel thanks to minimal intrusive fluorescent lighting and lanes divided between two sides versus one super long room with all of the lanes in one line. They have a total of 64 lanes. The balls are in decent condition, and despite being a league night, we were able to get a lane isolated from the heart of the action. I can't comment on the shoes because we are nerdy enough to own our own. The scoring system is up to date with the ability to turn on bumpers for certain players. (No, I don't bowl with bumpers!) Each lane had a clearly visible TV.\n\nWe had a little confusion with payment, but the cashier straightened everything out. We didn't sample the snack bar selections. \n\nOverall, a fairly modern bowling center where the only thing you really have to worry about are obnoxious bowling neighbors. Aren't they the worst?
