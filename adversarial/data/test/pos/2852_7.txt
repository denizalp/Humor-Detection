Hate to do this to you Aunt Chilada, but my one and only visit to your establishment kinda sucked!\n\nThe long story short goes like this:\n\n- Dinner was  maybe 2.5 stars. The Taco De Jeebus just wasn't amazing. Have had much better pork tacos in Phoenix.\n\n- Service at dinner was 1. The guy actually said to our friend \"wow, you're a clean plate club member!\" C'mon Spiffy, you don't say that to a lady, regardless. \n\n- Beer was a 4. But it was over priced.\n\n- Too many damn families with babies with what appeared to be \"baby SARS.\" If a kid is yacking up straight clear goo, ask the family to take them out of the dining room. By the time we got done eating we were surrounded in Mormon family hell. Maybe they think that Chilada's is Kolab, but sweet little baby jeebus, keep on your patrons so they're not spreading disease.\n\nWhere it really went to hell in a hand basket was when we went into the bar...\n\nMaybe it was because we were with our bald Mexican friend Mario. Maybe it was me with my tattoos hanging out of my Brooks Brothers shirt. Maybe it was my pretty girlfriend. Maybe it was Mario's wonderful wife.\n\nBut they never came to serve us at our table. Everyone else got table service, but it ended up with Mario and I having to sherpa back and forth from the bar with our drinks. The service really, really sucks in the bar. They weren't busy, the bar wasn't slammed, the 12 pieces of jail bait bar maids were just too lazy to attend to everything.\n\nWon't be going back.
