Sick kids! I have two kiddos with bad sore throats. I haven't had the time to make them noodle soup, so we drove to Pholicious and picked up 2 orders of Pho Kong (pho broth with bean sprouts, basil and lime, sans meat). It took chef 7 minutes to assemble the noodles and vegetables. The soup was packed in a separate container to be combined at home. One bowl fed two kids. They ate heartily and went early to bed. Each order was $5.50. For under $12, our family of 5 ate comfort food. Thank you, Pholicious!
