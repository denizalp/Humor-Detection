I bought my car here a few months ago. The salesman was super nice and knowledgeable and he got the deal done really quickly. I typically do not go to the dealership for car care\/maintenance but I was given \"5 free oil changes\" at the time I purchased the car. \nI recently went in for my free oil change and was told there were a few minor issues that needed to be taken care of (cleaning battery terminals, tire rotation, new wiper blades, etc). Upon picking up my car (I will say the shuttle service to CWRU is very nice for me, and the driver was very friendly), I paid and went on my way. When I got home, I opened the hood just to see what \"clean\" battery terminals looked like (since I paid $27 to have them cleaned), and noticed that they were just as corroded as when I dropped the car off. My boyfriend (a mechanic himself) verified that this service was in fact not performed. He took the car up the next day and they also agreed it was not done, and proceeded to clean them...\nI know it is something small, but had I not checked (like most people), I would have been ripped off...which is part of why people don't trust their automotive care technicians. Made me wonder how often they charge people for small things that don't get done. My car was there allll day long, not like they didn't have enough time. \nSo, from now on, they are literally only allowed to do the FREE oil change, everything else goes elsewhere.\n\nAnd upon reading other reviews...this seems to happen fairly often.
