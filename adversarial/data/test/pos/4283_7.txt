On the very rare... extremely rare occasions that I venture into Yorkville I am always very hard-up to find a bar.\n\nI don't need much, just a good bar, nothing swanky, preferably doucheless and minus over-priced beer.\n\nA place that I can saunter into and not be given the kind of once-over where pricetags are being assigned to the particulars of my ensemble and smirks are shared bc I'm rocking Payless shoes.\n\nNot an easy feat in Yorkville, but then a friend suggested The Pilot Tavern after a movie at the Varsity.\n\nI liked the \"flight deck\" decor and half expected to hear the theme song to Top Gun playing in the background... I just hummed it instead. The beer selection was def on par with a pretty substantial list of options. They serve 50 on tap. Be still my heart. \n\nServers were friendly and the atmosphere was comfy casual. I dug it, I drank... I found my Yorkville watering hole.\n\nI didn't eat there, nor did I get to scope out the patio so a return visit may be required in the near future.\n\nHowever I am sorely tempted to show up with everyone wearing a flightsuit and only calling eachother by our call signs. I would be \"Goose\".
