We love Mexican food. In a bad way. Why does a place with amazing food (espinaca queso, crispy potato tacos, steak tacos) less than 10 minutes away from our house with a beautiful (albeit overlooking Gold's Gym) patio get 2 stars?\n\nNo water. Requested multiple times from both server and food runner. Server clearly remembered I had asked for water about 10 minutes before and got really weird. Just apologize and bring water! Don't stay silent and awkward and avoid us!\n\nI'm a habitual 20% tipper to a fault...not this time. This place lost me as a potential regular.
