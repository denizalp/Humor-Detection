You pay $10 general admission - but after you get in, you pay much more in everything else for little return;\n\n(If  you're 21+ older - first WRISTBAND)\n\nWith whatever you DO\/EAT\/DRINK at the festival, you have to buy a money card. ALL food and beverage is deducted from the card, but even so, you only get 1-3 bites\/swigs of anything that you buy - the cost is so disproportionate to what you get that I'm pretty sure that you're just paying for everything at regular prices if not more.\n\nFor example, let's say you wanna get into the beer tasting are. We lined up to get into the beer area without having purchased the card yet, and they turned us away to yet another line (to get the card); \n\nWe were a party of three, and the volunteer didn't know how to give us three separate cards.\n\nThen we throw $40 bucks onto the card, and it costs you $20 to get into the beer tasting area. Half the amount on the card was gone within a few minutes!\n\nFor the beer tasting area (second WRISTBAND), there are two lines (kind of blending together), with a different person manning each line at the entrance. Nobody who works at the festival seemed to know how to organize, or what to tell people. We were told one thing at one line, but the guy who was manning our line had to double check with the guy manning the secondary line as to whether or not we were in the right line!\n\nOnce you get into the area, you get this little 4oz cup that they fill for every beer tasting- which costs $1 ea. ON TOP of the $20 beer admission; \n\nI asked for tequila shots from the tequila area and were only about 1oz - for $1.\n\nOut of all the food tents that I went to - \n1. the pizza was the most worth the money at $2 (Grimaldi's);\n2. they had super-dinky-mini-tacos, smaller than the palm of my hand, at $1 ea, \n3. three little mini-buffalo chicken balls, about the size of ping pong balls, for $2;\n4. ONE braised short rib for $6 + three bites of calamari\/greens for $4 (Tanzy's)\n\nWe kept  adding money to our cards.\n\nLast but not least, I fell asleep on the lawn while sittin with my buddy in the shade; a non-uniformed cop came by and asked me to stand up; I was kind of wobbly and tired from having a few drinks, and he asked us to leave! \n\nOther than falling asleep, I was NOT doing anything disruptive to draw any attention whatsoever. They escorted us out...I was respectful. \n\nBeen there, done that; once here was enough. \n\nThe great thing though about coming here, was that I was able to spend some time with my peeps.
