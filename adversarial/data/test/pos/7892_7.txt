What a bunch of chowder heads ! Really scrapping the barrel of the quality of employees they have here !\nBought a pair of smart wool socks that had a run in them went right back in store to swap them  , \nThere was a huge line two employees working then telling me to wait back in line to return and re buy another pair WHAT A JOKE !!\nBuy from Amazon !!! Cheaper and you won't have to deal with stupidity !!
