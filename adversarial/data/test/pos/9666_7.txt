I have been going here on a regular basis since my job change.  From the beginning it has been good and had maintained the goodness.  It is not China Town goodness but close.  \n\nFor catering to an all types Cuisine in the neighborhood they can cater to the strong Asian Cuisine, because it is owned and run by Asians but also cater to the neighborhood which is not as much.  In my opinion that is impressive.\n\nThe prices are a bit hard to maneuver until you become a regular.  I ordered a soup and was told there was only one size.  About 15 minutes after I ordered and was eating my food my coworker came in with a half size.  Uggh, well he told me how to order but seriously if I'm asking it means I am looking!  Blahhh...\n\nThe food is good, filling and makes me want to take out instead of cooking in after a long day...
