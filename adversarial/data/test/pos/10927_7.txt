I wrote my original review just a few days ago, so go check it out for more basic info about the place.\n\nI've been back a couple of times since then and am more and more impressed every time I go.  Even though the server lineup has been different every time, they are very fast and attentive.  Absolute top notch customer service, perhaps surpassed only by Jin and his crew at BFG.\n\nThe fried chicken on fried rice is easily one of the top 5 dishes I've had in Las Vegas.  It's exactly what it sounds like, served with a small cup of sweet & sour sauce on the side.  I've uploaded a pic of it and you can see how massive it is.  Probably a good 3-4 cups of fried rice and 2 large pieces of excellent quality chicken, and just for $7.  It's also really good reheated, provided you throw the chicken in a pan to get the right level of crispiness.  \n\nI've also had a pork panang, and once again asked for it as hot as possible and even said \"way above 10\".  After the meal I asked the server and she said she had actually given me an 8 or 9, which I felt was more like a 5 or 6.  Meh, we'll get there one of these days.\n\nI had my first Thai iced tea here and it was awesome.  Can't really compare it to any other place, but as someone who pretty much only likes sickeningly sweet southern iced tea, that should give you an idea where I'm coming from.  Even as picky of an eater as I am, there's so much I want to try on the menu and I plan on probably going back a dozen or more times in the next month for sure.
