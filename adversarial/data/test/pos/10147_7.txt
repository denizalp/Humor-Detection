This place is sooooo good. I'm really picky about my ramen and you can tell they make everything from scratch. The rice and salmon in the salmon bowl  was also seasoned and cooked perfectly. The service is great, the chef even came out and asked how everything was. It's very clean and decorated with cute art. I'll be back.
