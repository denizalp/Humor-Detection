Word is starting to spread about I Love Arepas and boy oh boy does it live up to all the buzz it's receiving. At a little less than $4 a pop, you're going to end up walking away from this food stand with a mouth full of smiles and belly full of happy.\n\nIf you asked me what an arepa was a few hours ago, I'd reply back with a blank stare and a scratch of the head. Ask me this in the present, and you'll find me blindingly reciting the Wikipedia description word-for-word, while dual-wielding an arepa in each hand.\n\nThe arepa is basically a fried flat cornmeal based sandwich filled generously with a meat of choice. Here, at I Love Arepas,  they have all of the usual meats that you'd find at a taco shop (beef, carne asada, shredded chicken\/beef, tripe, lengua, etc.), along with their own unique concoctions. \n\nSince it was my first visit I was recommended these two items:\n*#1 Carne Mechada - Shredded beef, bell pepper, onions, tomato, garlic\n*#7 Reina Pepiada - Shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise, \ncilantro, green peas\n\nI'd say that the #7 came out the winner in this one, but the carne mechada was at a close second due to how meaty it was (shredded beef lovers rejoice!). My mouth is flooding with drool now that I'm recalling what I ordered just a few minutes ago. I'm going to make it a mission to try every item on their menu. Before you know it, I'll be a stuffed, wobbling arepa machine by the time I'm through with it.\n\nOne downside about I Love Arepas is that it's located in Stabbytown, USA. The area isn't the greatest. If you've been to Luv It Frozen Custard (across the street), you'd know what I mean. If hobos don't scare you, give I Love Arepas a shot without hesitation. If the common-day bearded hobo does give you the willies, bring a friend along with you and share the love.
