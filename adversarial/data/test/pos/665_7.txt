Casual atmosphere, less than insane prices, a formidable collection of beer, beer pong and darts, and finally nickel PBR Tuesdays... I think all of this easily adds up to a place worth checking out especially if you happen to find yourself at Crystals, City Center or within walking distance. If you are a beer lover, then it is worth a cab ride for sure.\n\nI have eaten here on 3 occasions, and each time has been a pleasant experience. This last time service may have been a little slow, but I rarely get too worked up about service, as I was a crappy waitress in a past life. \n\nI have sampled several of their appetizers, but honestly, I think the real value and real tastiness lies smack dab in the middle of the menu. This is where they showcase their carvery. You pick some meats, some bread and some sauces, and then you go to town making sandwiches. They roast all of their meats, and it shows. The turkey is so tender that it would fall apart if you stared at it hard enough. The pineapple chutney could be eaten straight like a little sweet salad, but I usually go ahead and throw it on my sandwich. I get the challah bread, another winner. My husband went with the salmon last night. Yes, they have salmon! I am pretty sure I heard him mumble \"delicious\" in between stuffing his mouth. With the 1\/2 lb option you get enough meat and bread to make a very nice 6 inch sub equivalent. My turkey was $12. Once when staying at Aria my husband grabbed a 1\/2 lb turkey to go, and it was enough for a light lunch for the two of us!\n\nIf you are looking for fine dining, probably not the place, but if you want a more casual place to throw back some beers and sandwiches, this is the magic spot.
