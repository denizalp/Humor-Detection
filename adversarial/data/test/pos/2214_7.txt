The staff are very friendly. Immediately when we entered, we were greeted by 3 different people. They offer great service too.\n\nEach restaurant has different versions of Pho so we like to compare. We got the veggie pho and it had celery in it which is a different twist. We also wanted to try a bun dish as well. I didn't expect it to come out cold. It was tasty, but not satisfying (mainly due to me wanting something hot). Although I have to say that the grilled shrimp were very delicious! Their chili and oil condiment was very spicy and a very dark red.\n\nThe space size is medium; I'm sure it can fill up fast on a busy night. The heat system was broken so they had a little space heater in one section. I wish they would have set us next to it.
