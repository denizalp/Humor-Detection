I didn't even know gourmet ramen existed in Las Vegas. This was a small spot hidden on Spring Mountain Rd. It's really hot and ramen may not be the ideal food but it tasted great here. The chashu meat was really soft. The noodles were thin and the tonkatsu broth was very flavorful. Glad to have tried a place like this. It looks like they take pride and appreciate the craft of ramen here. It just makes the meal that much more satisfying. \n\nRecommendation: Tonkatsu Ramen with extra chasu and hard boiled egg.
