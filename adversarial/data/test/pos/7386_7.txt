So I went online and I booked a Venetian room for me and my girls for a weekend trip to Vegas. I specifically wanted 2 queen beds because there was 6 of us; the more beds the better, right? Well, when we checked in the hotel really late like at 11pm, all the double queen bed rooms were taken. How does this make sense to anyone? I booked 2 queen beds months in advance before our vacation day, and I come to the Venetian to find out that what I asked for is all gone?? Why do hotels do this? They shouldn't sell a crapload of queen bed rooms if they don't have enough for everyone!!! At least save the rooms for the people who actually booked it months in advance. They should prioritize reservations before anything else, not first come first serve who checks in the hotel sooner. \n\nThe lady said she will upgrade us to the Venezia towers for free.... The Venezia tower sucks! It's the exact same thing as their regular rooms -_- upgrade my *ss! Definitely won't be coming back!
