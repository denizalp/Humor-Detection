This Mimi's is the worst. The vibe is as if they are a restaurant in training. My server was nice but slightly flustered.\n\nI ordered the benedict with bacon and tomatoes. When you look at the picture on how it was served it was sloppy and made with no care. Mimi's has always given some presentation but this was food on a plate.\n\nIt looked a mess and then I put my fork in it had egg shells inside. I said to my family I knew this dish looked off when it arrived and now egg shells.\n\nI told my server and she was great about getting me something else and apologizing. So I ordered my next usual the Quiche Lorraine taste great but once again thrown on a plate. Typically its served on lettuce with fruit on a plate. This was not the case.\n\nLow Fat Blueberry muffin was great as always..\n\nThis location just didn't feel welcoming and the experience was subpar, management they need help.
