NEVER AGAIN! Not only have I formally filed a  complaint against this location, I have even gone as far as requesting that my bank reverse all charges to my card!\n\nBottom line, do not patronize this establishment unless you want to be scammed out of your money & left without the responsibility of customer service! I stopped back in, just 15min after leaving from getting a mani & pedi there, because my gel color started to turn colors & become splotchy! Not only was I told that the nail color became splotchy because I am African American--so my nail-beds must be dark underneath (completely false & ignorant); I was also spoken to very disrespectfully by the \"owner\" and told not to come back. When I got home & called to inform him that his customer service was less than stellar & my nails still looked incorrect, he hung up on me and refused to answer the phone---twice! Mind you, this marked my FIRST visit...EVER! Unbelievable! \n\nIt's quite unfortunate, but it seems that this location fulfills all the stereotypes you run into with these particular settings:They use off-brand polishes in name-brand bottles, polish-thinners, conveniently speak or don't speak English, and only want to see you when there's a money exchange in the near future! \n\nJust consider yourself warned...some things are a hard lesson learned.
