Finally mgt got rid of the guy with the noisy,vicious,dog.But wait..I had to contact the owner of the property to get anything done.After speaking with the owner by phone and informing him about the issues at Oakview apts the mgt company scrambled to fix all the issues.Thanks to Tami Linklatter who by chance visited the property personally and found that after a year I was not lying about the guy with the nasty dog.To her credit she did appologize for my \"inconvenience\".However the president of the company Jeffry Hanrath and the manager David Kratz are still to full of themselves to pick up the phone and acknowledge that they were derilect in there responsibilities and do not deserve to be in a buisness that requires dealing with people in a fair and decent manner.My suggestion to the ownership is to at least demote Hanrath and to fire Kratz.And as a precursor to all this Mr Hanrath claims to be a former U S Marine.Horsemanure.I am a former marine and would have never let a former marine brother go through this mess.You showed no class dignity or pride.You are a phony and claiming to be a former military member is a crime.As long as these two losers are part of this Valley income property staff more mistakes are sure to emerge.Mcdonalds is hiring you two.
