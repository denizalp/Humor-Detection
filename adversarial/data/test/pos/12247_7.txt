The concept and restaurants of Downtown Summerlin have good intentions. Unfortunately, like every other restaurant I've tried in DTS, Public School is a bust. My friends and I arrived at 9pm on a Thursday. We walk in and two people are talking at the doorway. Oh wait, they're not just two people who are hanging out lounging on the doorway with horrible posture, they work here apparently despite their nonchalance toward any potential customers. \n\nWe were seated in a HUGE booth for the 3 of us that was unbussed with crumbs and sticky crap all over. Lovely. When asking for directions to the restrooms, same rude service. So we get our table cleaned, find the bathroom, and eventually order some very mediocre food. Fried cauliflower is NOT amazing like everyone describes. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's just fried cauliflower for $9 or something. I think their mark-up on this is 999981625536% as a head of cauliflower is $.89 at the store.\n\nWe ordered the chicken & waffles that everyone raved of and was shown on our menu. We were given tandoori brick chicken instead? I guess our waitress didn't hear us, but the mystery gets thicker... apparently chicken & waffles is no longer on the menu, despite what we saw infront of our eyes! So the host who was lounging at the door is handing out old menus and the server who assumed we said one thing didn't ask again to clarify. So when she brings out the wrong item, she said \"is that okay? Do you want to keep it?\" Ha!!! If someone ordered chicken and waffles, do you think tandoori brick chicken with middle eastern spices will fill that craving? No. Of course we don't want the brick chief and want chicken and waffles which despite being off the menu, they made for us? \n\nSo we finally get the chicken and waffles. Waffles were good hitting every one of my taste buds - sweet, savory, luscious, crispy. The chicken was disgusting. They were fried chicken tenders, but the tenders were HUGE and cut poorly. Think about a 3 inch chicken tender... The only good thing we ate was the kale Caesar salad which I would order again if someone dragged me to public school 702. If I wasn't bound and dragged, you would never find me here again. \n\nMy review is confusing, but so was our experience. Everything about the night contradicted another. Hosts, servers, and chefs had no idea what was going on and were not working as a team. The restaurant has been open long enough to fix these issues so there are no excuses for our disappointing night.
