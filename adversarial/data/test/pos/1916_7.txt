Michael is the best server ever! He worked our table every few minutes and was very attentive to our needs. We had the mac and cheese and ahi tuna and finished it off with the s'mores and deconstructed carrot cake. It was all amazing!\n\nThe atmosphere is real chill and relaxing. We will definitely be back!
