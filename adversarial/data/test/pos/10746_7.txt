Well to start... \n\n\nThe BEER:\nThe selection is the best I have ever seen. The beer menu is actually a novel. I have been very impressed with their ability to keep such a diverse number of beers stocked and cold. And if you are feeling daring they even offer a number of Beer-Cocktails. (An interesting idea I never thought of.\n\nThe FOOD:\nCheck out the menu for yourself before you go. I however would say while the food is bad, it is too expensive and the selection is very lacking.  If I go to the Bier Markt it is not for the food.\n\nThe ATMOSPHERE:\nWell, the music is usually very good, however it always seems to be too loud. I usually don't mind loud, but I have thought of wearing earplugs there. \nApparently there is a dress-code in effect. And what a ridiculous one it is.  T-Shirts OK, Shorts not-OK. Honestly I don't get it. Also if you are going to enforce a dress code don't let your bouncer wear nylon cargo pants. (They aren't tactical uniform and its not fooling anyone)\n\nOverall--- Not a bad place to go if you eat first, don't mind spending some extra money, and risking permanent hearing loss from the 700-800 Hz range.
