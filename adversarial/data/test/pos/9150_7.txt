11\/30\n\nIf I review the self-car wash... is it like, reviewing: myself? \"Tiffany did a half-assed job of cleaning the car! Can't even reach the roof!\" \n\nThis is a nice enough place. It's strange to me that places like this exist. In Cali, you either take your car to Shell to the automatic car wash, while you freak out the kids in the back seat about how if they won't stop whining, you'll tie them to the roof the next time you visit; or you use your garden hose in your own driveway. \n\nTo me, this is like paying to use someone else's garden hose and vacuum cleaner. But it's cool, because I don't have a garden hose or a shop vac. I wish they had eco-friendly soap available. If you ask, they'll say it is, but it doesn't smell like something you could accidentally ingest and not wind up in the emergency room for. \n\nThis is a great place to go if you want it to rain or snow. Because guaranteed: once you finish up, you'll feel the first few drops of a brewing storm on your face.
