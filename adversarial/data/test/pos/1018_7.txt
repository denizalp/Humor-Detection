Holly's review is right on!  This was my second year doing this event.  Last year, I did the bicycle ride.  That was such a cluster, it wasn't offered this year.\n\nI don't run, but I walk the 5K.  I always have my beard with me so that's never a problem.  I also park in the north lot and make a quick exit on Sunset.\n\nI really dislike the growth in the numbers of dogs that are here every year.  At least they had the good sense to crap at home before they came here, because I saw no doggy do anywhere.\n\nIt's fun doing the walk because the entertainment beforehand--Jabbawockeez from the Monte Carlo, some dancers from the topless show Fantasy at the Luxor, and five flying Santas that parachuted to the parking lot from a helicopter high above the boulevard, and others--make this a fun event. Also, the chance to walk over the freeway on Sunset, something you don't do everyday is worth the walking.\n\nIt's also the main fundraiser for Opportunity Village, a very needy charity in Southern nevada.  I'll be back next year for another go, suit and all!
