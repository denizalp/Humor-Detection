I like to drink.  With such territory comes the eternal crossroads of either needing a solid libation, or something to soak up my now twisted and spinning reality.  With this being said, Clever Koi offers the best solutions to both of these predicaments.  Actually, I'll take that a step further - they offer both, at the same time.  I'm not talking cheap and satisfying \"you call it's\" and 2AM breakfast burritos that you hope the microwave killed off any and all of the handlers bacteria...let alone the syphilis growing in those ripened eggs.  \n\nNo sir, this place is the bees knees.  My girlfriend's favorite date night spot.  Their cocktails are a symphony of flavors.  Kind of like Method Man's album \"Tical.\"  Their food?  Just stop.  Stop, Chef...I think Jared, I don't know, I'm usually drunk there.  You're too much.  It ain't right.  It ain't fair.  It ain't holy.  The Pork Ramen?  It's so good I think it ghost writes for Drake.  If anyone else tried to sell me a black bean & celery root pancake, I'd call in bomb threats from their mamas phone to the nearest Wal-Mart - no, AJ's (appeals to a broader elite) - until the cops circled the house of that breeder of such a limp-wristed individual.  But not this one.  Chef...we're sticking with Jared, has concocted something delicious in that dish.  I recommend it to the most savagely meat-headed of 'roided out individuals just to watch their reality crumble.\n\nA lot of places try to rest on the laurels of hip décor and staff with nice beards.  Clever Koi takes both of these and says, hey man, we're pretty AND smart.  Know what I mean?  Roman is a dope bartender too.  Props on his Diamondbacks loyalty, cuz' they suck.  Know what doesn't suck though?  That guy.  I witnessed him a while back deal with two drunkards (more than myself, wow) at the bar top flashing all shades of unnecessary rudeness, like people tend to do when they're being served.  Handled it like the suave pro that he is.  They'll be back, I guarantee it.  Every week.  And it'll kill the staff slowly.  But hey, dolla dolla bills yo.\n\nPlus, they're right next to George and Dragon.  Which offers really cheap rum and cokes, and jager bombs.  So when you're trying to drunkenly look for Pokémon with your girlfriend in Indian Steele park, you can walk right over from ze Koi, load up on cheap booze, and proceed to dodge the homeless denizens of the park.  If I had one knock on Clever Koi, now that I think about it, it'd be that they don't have jager.  Props to them for keeping it classy.\n\nTheir bathrooms are also more artistic than that hole you call a home.\n\nGood brunch too.
