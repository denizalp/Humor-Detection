On our last day at Mandalay Bay Convention Center, we hadn't eaten since breakfast and needed a little bite to eat so I found the food court outside the convention hall near the Shark Reef attraction. \n\nI ordered two burgers and learned that they do not just sell burgers. You have to get a burger with fries. Everything is so overpriced! The burgers sadly, were quite undercooked. I ate some parts of the perimeter of the burger but couldn't eat anywhere near the center. It was gross. It was such a long walk to go back to the food court from where our booth was, so we just said screw it and threw it away.  $29 and change for two undercooked burgers, fries and one sprite. Yucka!
