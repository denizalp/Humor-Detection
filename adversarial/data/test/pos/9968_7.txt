This store has an extensive collection of things I do not want, and none of the things I was hoping for when I came here. What I did end up buying turned out to be the worst version of said item I have ever tasted. There are no freshly made deli foods of any kind. Quite a bummer of a place unless you are looking for something canned, or from a box. Then they have you covered. They also have a pretty good selection of candies.
