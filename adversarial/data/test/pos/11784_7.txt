The food was ok.  Honestly, the prime rib wasn't seasoned at all, the soup (shrimp bisque) was out of this world salty, and the sides I tried - rice pilaf, garlic mashed potatoes, crab mac and cheese, and sauteed mushrooms weren't that special.  I don't get the bread at all, its soaked in olive oil and there's cooked green peppers and onion bits on top.  The juiciest dry bread I've ever had if that makes any sense.\n\nBut I will probably go back because:  A) the atmosphere and decor is unique, B) its a fancy restaurant but not overly stuffy, and C) for a fancy restaurant the prices were reasonable for the portions.  Not a value meal by any means, but I was particularly impressed with the 5 dollar add a plate deal.  My boyfriend and I decided to split the largest prime rib dinner and the waiter offered this option - for 5 dollars we get separate soup\/salad, potato side choices and our own cut of meat.  Great deal.  \n\nAll in all, A-ok but I would've given 3.5 stars if that was an option.
