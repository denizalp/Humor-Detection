I been to Yogurt Mountain few time now and I just love it. I love their decor, customer service and and I love the fact that they keep changing the flavors to keep it interesting for their customers. \n\nI was here last weekend and the whole store was packed. They were handing out the taste cups for people to taste them and some kids were just tasting one after another so I asked her, is that OK? she said ya we have it under control for the most part, we do get couple of folk like them but it's OK. So I asked, can I try one? she is like you already been here couple of times right? so I was like Yesss, and she said, relax I am just kidding. So she gave me couple taste cups to try them. I tried the one I never had before so decided to go with the new flavors. \n\nThey even have a cool iPad type of unit at the checkout counter where you can enter your cell # to get couple code every week. \n\nOverall, I love all the flavors they offer, I love their taste, really dig their customer service.
