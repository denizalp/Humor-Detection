After  my regular doctor's office closed down, I was forced to try and find someone else to go to.  Based solely on Yelp reviews, I chose to go to Trails Family Medical and I was not disappointed.  The doctor is lovely and very thorough without being over the top by sending me for all kinds of unnecessary tests.  I'm very happy with my choice to change to this doctor.
