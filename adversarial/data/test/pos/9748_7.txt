F*cking douchebag hosts and bouncers. Pretentious as sh*t.  Really?  Power trips are ridiculous!\n\nA call from a friend landed us at Haze with a table and a bottle.  This of course was after we waited for easily and hour despite being \"on the list\" which is such bullshit in Vegas anyway.  Much appreciated, but completely regretted after we were kicked out of our spot within an hour of arriving.  Try asking us if we'd buy another bottle ass!  We would've bought one and you might have made a bit more money.  You could've even tried being a little nice.  Instead, you were complete dick and to you sir, I only wish you endless nights of equalled douchebaggery!\n\nWhat saved the evening?  The fantastic company I was with, and the bar opposite the entrance.  There we found a friendly female bartender with a strong pour that made up for the first guy that sold my friend $15 Redbulls with a splash of vodka.  \n\nFreaking Vegas!
