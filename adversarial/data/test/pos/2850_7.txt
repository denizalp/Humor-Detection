This place was okay. Sad this place didn't live up to the hype. Came in at 530 on a Tuesday and it was ghost town. I was starving but they have no real food, only pastries... My only option was a muffin. I asked for an apple malt and the guy told me to hold on and check if they have it... Then I ordered a muffin and the guy was like oh idk what kind these are so I just picked a random one LMAO even though they were all marked... I asked for a almond one and he was like oh wait that's banana. So after three attempts I was like okay fine. I sat down and he's like oh so it's for here then... Yeah???? They also put a table in front of the menu how awkward\n\nIt was really confusing how to order. There's no signs and wasn't even sure where the line formed. They also don't have their WIFI posted in plain view, a girl next to me had to tell me it when I got up to ask, they should put it on their menu board. The prices are okay at most, cheaper than Starbucks. Their pastries are fairly priced too. \n\nThe interior is really cute except for the cheap sterilmate Walmart trash can in the front... Yikes! Also it's SOOOO cold in here like wtf. And such slow internet... Nothing would load or took 5 minutes. We eventually gave up after waiting 10 min for a webpage to load.
