I came in with a discount through a text promo- I highly recommend signing up online, as you get a free race for your birthday as well as various discounts throughout the year. It's a fun experience for something different, but I wouldn't pay full price. We were in and out in under half an hour from start to finish, for $10\/pp. The same experience, at full price, ~$30\/pp.\n\nYou'll fill out a waiver, watch a short safety video, then get in your cart and get going. The race is 12 laps, as completed by the fastest person. I'd suggest coordinating your own group for the best experience. They do have a few arcade games to play if there is a wait.
