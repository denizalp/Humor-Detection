Formerly K Sushi, I tried Seido tonight and enjoyed the service and the meal.\n\nI ordered the 8 piece sushi combo and the 6 piece veggie tempura. \n\nThe veggie tempura is a great deal ($3.25). They said 6 pieces, but the portions are large: 2 broccoli florets, a large slice of carrot, acorn squash, asparagus and onion ring. They were battered and fried to perfection. The tempura sauce was a little too sweet for my palette, and it was not served with grated radish.\n\nThe sushi was decent. They gave me 2 pieces of snapper, 1 piece of yellowtail (hamachi), 2 pieces of fatty salmon, unagi or grilled eel with sauce, white tuna and tuna (maguro). The nigiri sushi was sliced well with little to no gristle. The California roll I chose instead of the spicy tuna was made with rice cooked well, but a little unevenly rolled. It still tasted good and held up to my son's standards when I brought him leftovers.\n\nOn my way out, the chef\/owner (Mr. Lee) was so nice and gave me a 10% off my next visit. \n\nCheck out their Happy Hour prices. The tempura was on their HH appetizer menu!
