I love this place.  I'd love it even more if it was in Plaza Midwood, but what can ya do!  \n\nTheir fries are this insane potato chip-had-sex-with-a-french-fry concoction and they are AMAAAAAAAAAAZING.  they apparently bake them & then fry them.   I have yet to have anything on the menu that I haven't liked & the same has gone for everyone i've taken there.  they've all raved about the food & one friend after finishing off her burger & fries ordered a 2nd basket of fries she thought they were so good!\n\nthey have a killer beer selection, which rotates near constantly (so their beer menu is never up to date, my only gripe) but who cares when on a tuesday you can get a Big Boss Big Operator for half price??\n\nI really need to check this place out for breakfast though, it sounds yummy & cheap.
