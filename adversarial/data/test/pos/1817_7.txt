This place kinda creeps me out. It's rundown and...well...a little on the scary side. Staff are not exactly unpleasant, but they sure aren't friendly either. And frankly, they really just don't seem to give a damn. Don't ask any questions. It seems like patients are treated like a revolving door here. A staffer checks your blood pressure and weight. Then a nurse or doctor hands out prescriptions. And that's it.
