I love this place!\n\nI buy ladybugs here a few times a year. I keep dumping them on our rosebushes out front and they seem to hang out eating aphids? for a little while and then move on to our neighbors house. It's funny that one of our neighbors was saying they have a ton of ladybugs...I always tell her to send them back to my house. She had no idea that I was buying them and unleashing them at my house :)\n\nI'm not a fan of the caged birds everywhere. When I asked about the birds the employees said they are rescues and I seriously hope that they are. \nThere are a few kitty faces that hang around and I was totally startled the first time I went here a kitty brushed up against my leg when I was at the checkout podium. Wow what a sweet little kitty :) \n\nThey sell most fruit trees...but not yuzu :( but they sell those beautiful yummy Ponderosa lemon trees! Those trees are amazing! They sell almond trees, blueberry bushes (don't forget to get a male and a female!), avocado trees....they sell a lot of yummy items to make your own sanctuary. \n\nAs far as plants they have a decent selection of organic vegetables and a huge variety of plants. I like to buy organic when possible because us and our landscapers have never used chemicals nor fertilizers on our almost half acre lot. I would like to keep it that way always. A few weeds here and there can be pulled but chemicals are bad and people should always avoid them. Especially having fur kids, the chemicals concern me. \n\nAs far as customer service, wow, sometimes these guys talk my ears off! I can call and ask about a certain item and they seriously give out their own personal cell numbers. Let's just say they are SUPER friendly or just simply work on commission.\n\nI am a fan of this place and will continue to drive past Star and directly to Moon any day.
