Great tour, featuring a very passionate guide named Manny. I don't think I've ever met anyone as inspired by neon signs, art, or Las Vegas history as Manny--which made for an even better tour with plenty of fun facts and interesting looks into Vegas history. \n\nWhen you need a break from getting #turntup, The Neon Museum is a must see!
