Finding a Ramen place that serves broth that's not pork based is challenging in the valley. Hachi Ramen offers a chicken based broth so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We were welcomed as we walked in and seated immediately. \n\nWhile browsing through the menu, we noticed that all the options had a piece of pork and pork fat in it. The waiter came to our table to ask us if we had any questions after he had served us our drinks. We asked about pork free options and he said they had the chicken broth and that they could skip the pork piece and pork fat. So we decided to go with that. The dish is served with an egg so I asked for mine to be without the egg. Since the dish now became just ramen, broth, green onions, bamboo-shoots and a piece of Nori, my husband was ok with that (with the egg). I decided to add corn and mushrooms to mine and I ordered a combo which is served with plain white rice, 3 fried boneless chicken pieces and pickles. We also ordered edamame and Takoyaki.\n\nWhile we waited for our food, I checked in on Yelp. As a thank you for checking in, they offer sesame balls for dessert if you order food worth $30+.\n\nThe appetizers came out almost immediately. The Takoyaki was served with fish skin on top which I swear kept moving! Lol \n\nThe dish had a distinctive and delicious taste. It's basically a rice ball stuffed with octopus. It was very foreign to us but tasty. I didn't try the edamame but my husband enjoyed it. \n\nOur bowls of Ramen came out shortly after that. They looked pretty good. I added some soy sauce to mine and tried it. It tasted good. We enjoyed the fried chicken. It had lots of flavor. \n\nWhile we were eating, the waiter asked us to let him know when we are ready for dessert and we marked the offer as used.\n\nWhen we finished eating, we asked for the dessert. 2 sesame balls were served. They looked perfect. When I looked up sesame ball recipes, I realized that the red paste that was in the balls was actually red bean paste. It tasted great. \n\nOur bill was a little over $30 which is not bad. It was a good experience and the service was excellent. I just wish they had more non pork Ramen options so that they don't end up being meatless.
