I remember when Roberto's was still somewhat of a novelty when I was growing up here in Vegas. Now, I feel like there is a Roberto's around every damn corner. They just keep poppin up like babies in a Mormon family (No offense to Mormons or the Mormon religion). Can't complain I guess :\/\n\nNot much has changed. Some are still open 24 hrs if you wanna get your late night taco fix on. \nTheir shredded beef hard tacos are still dank asf, dripping with grease after every crunchy bite. I recently ordered their chips and guac here (this was actually my first time ordering chips and guac from Roberto's), and it was some green guac sauce, not actual guacamole. That was disappointing. Besides that, I still love my oily hard shell beef tacos drizzled with their green and red salsa.
