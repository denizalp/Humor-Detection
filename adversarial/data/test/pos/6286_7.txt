This was the first time I'd visited Drai's AfterHours since it moved from Bill's Casino. The set up was pretty much the same, minus the dark stairwell to enter. It still has that dark, sultry feel to it, which is part of the appeal. The front room is EDM\/house music, and the back room was hip hop. I don't even know what time this place closes- my friends said that they stayed till about 8am! \n\nAt the time we visited, the EDM room was pretty empty, but the hip hop room was definitely full and jumping! The DJ was great and kept everyone dancing. The line was crazy when we arrived at 3, and when I left at 5:00 (I couldn't keep going with my friends), it was even crazier! I had made a promise to myself that I was going to beat the sun home, and even though it was light outside when I pulled into the garage, the sun wasn't out- so I win!
