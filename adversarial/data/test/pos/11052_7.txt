I was in the area and took to Yelp to find me a new spot (that I haven't tried yet) that offered Hawaiian food. Do you ever have that random craving of Hawaiian food? Well for me, it was today. \n\nWhen I arrived to pace my take out order, I walked in and it was packed. I thought to myself this must be a good sign; almost all the dining tables were full. I tried to creep on those sitting and eating to see how big their portions were and to just see what they were eating. From what I saw the portions looked quite large.\n\nI ordered one of \"the specials of the day,\" called the Aloha Bento. This included hellllllla rice, a piece of spicy Korean teriyaki chicken, a couple thin slices of teriyaki beef, 1 redonda hot dog and a small sauce cup filled with cold Mac salad. Seriously, I was excited to try this place but to my disappointment- it's not that great. The meat and rice ratio was just off for me; there was SO much more rice compared to the meat. The chicken was okay, and the beef was slightly rubbery. The Mac salad had a weird sour taste to it, I hope I don't get sick tomorrow. Ugh, yikes! \n\nI'm going to stick to my Island Flavor for any and all Hawaiian food cravings!
