Apparently South Point is one of the casinos that a lot of Hawaii residents who moved to Vegas go to so here we were, going to South Point.\n\nWe had just got off the plane and this particular casino was going to be the place I would lose my gambling virginity to.\n\nI played craps, didn't know what I was doing but apparently I lost. Weeee I love it!\n\nHere's one of my favorite parts about this casino. They comp your drinks if you play. Get drunk off free drinks and lose money? Yeeee! Just don't forget to tip.\n\nWe waited till 12AM to hit up the restaurant inside since apparently there was this awesome $3 steak and eggs deal which I will probably write a review for after this.
