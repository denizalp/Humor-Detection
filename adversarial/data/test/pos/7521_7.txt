My guy pal and I were looking forward to a nice pedicure (his first time!) and liked the fact that Luxy was open late. We made an appt at 845. Nice on the phone, not nice in person. When we got there, the male nail tech said \"I don't do guy's feet, we'll call someone in for that.\" I didn't realize I needed to specify gender when I made the reservation. Unfortunately my poor friend had to wait until Jenny arrived (but that was 35min later?!?) \n\nHe spent 10min for the entire pedicure, which was $28! Seemed a bit steep and I'm coming from the Bay Area. Plus, unfortunately my heels still could have used some work. Jenny was nice enough to fix it - but charged me an extra $5 for it! Just wished she would have mentioned it before she started grating away. \n\nIn a nutshell, I felt bamboozled and was shocked by the discrimination. To top it off, the polish on my big toe was chipped this morning. Go to another nail salon!
