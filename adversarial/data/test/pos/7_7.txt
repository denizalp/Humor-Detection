Dang guys, why such low stars? \n\nI've been here a couple times and had no issue. Granted, I did my research online, printed and filled out all the paperwork prior to arrival. Plus I came midweek and almost as soon as they opened up. The employees I've encountered were pleasant and helped me out to the best of their ability. The timeline is pretty good too. I was told my wait was thirty minutes for my passport and was almost spot on. \n\nNot too shabby!
