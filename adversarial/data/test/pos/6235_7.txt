I love what trashy people who aren't actual customers of the business are writing about this place. Really? You don't like the mascot? Well, too bad. Don't write a review if you're not an actual customer.\n\nThat being said, Grind is still fabulous. The food is great, and often when I get pizza from next door, I still stop into Grind and pick up some sweet potato fries. If I want a non fast food burger, though, this is the place to go. Better than Fatburger, MUCH better than that In-n-Out garbage, and the service is always great. \n\nKeep up the good work, guys!
