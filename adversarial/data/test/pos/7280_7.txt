Do NOT rent here! I came home at 10:30pm and EVERY spot was taken. I parked in the maintenance spot. Mind you , I've been a resident here for 3yrs! They did not call me in the morning, they towed my car! I had absolutely no where else to park, in my own residence at 10:30pm. A courtesy call would have been appreciated. Also, they claim to be pet friendly, yet there are no areas with garbages to take your dog. I do not recommend this place.
