I've been to a few of these steam kettle cooked joints. Ritter's in Costa Mesa, The Boiler in Chino Hills, Texas Star in Texas Station, but Oyster Bar in Palace Station is THE BEST.\n\nThe clam chowder is the creamiest, with the most big pieces of clam; the least amount of sand.\n\nThe pan roast has the most shrimp, crab and lobster.\n\nThe bread is hot and not stale.\n\nPlus if you go at the right time, you get Ricardo (the Filipino chef). He is the BEST. Pro tip: go on New Year's Day morning and for sure you will never encounter a line.\n\nYes it's pricey (for me) but you can bring leftovers home and add more shrimp in there for another meal. \n\nThe minus is 99% of the time there is a huge line, and people don't give a shit they are holding other people up; like they are done but just sit there and gab. It's just the trade off I guess.
