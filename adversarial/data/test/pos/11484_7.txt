I must apologize to Norm , Daren and Iain for not listening to my favorite \nNo Pho friends sooner.. Because I made a BIG mistake waiting to go here!! I will promptly make up for it by going as many times as possible this week!! \n\nI love this place , yup local owned with a sense of mom and pop goodness. Reminds you of back east...The soda selection is phenomenal and looks great on display as you eat. \n\nThe Ruben is my new favorite , rye bread , juicy well seasoned pastrami, sauerkraut and light toasty goodness. \nPlus one had the Cheese steak that was really good except he opted for extra heat and I couldn't handle it .. but still great. \nFries are fresh and plentiful ....one basket will serve 2-3 people . \n\nGo here Go here now ....and take a friend , let's not waste another moment.
