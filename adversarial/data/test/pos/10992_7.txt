Don't let the location fool you (located in an older strip mall in S. Scottsdale) this place is an oasis of relaxation.  I have been twice now and I will be back as often as my budget allows!\n\nHere are a few of the highlights:\n\n*This is a true reflexology experience that includes head-toe massage along with your foot treatment.  The therapists I have had were great, lots of pressure (which I like).\n\n*Price is competitive and worth the experience.  They also just started offering packages for better pricing options if you decide to become a regular. \n\n*Very clean, professional service.\n\n*Rooms are good sized, semi-private, and quiet (I hate the places where you are right next to another person and can hear everything), this feels much more like a spa experience. \n \n*As in many foot-spa places, not everyone is 100% versed in English but I had no issues communicating with my therapist and the front desk staff certainly speaks English well.  \n\nSo glad to have this right in my back-yard.  I almost didn't want to let the secret out but I certainly want them to stick around so I had to recommend!
