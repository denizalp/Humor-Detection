So before we get into the food, let's talk about the setting. Although it's in a sorta sketchy part of town, this place is bright, has lots of Windows and more modern decor. I would go as far as to say that it feels clean! Yes! Clean! \n\nThe service is pretty fast and generally friendly- not too friendly, mind you. \n\nFull disclosure- I've only been here for lunch... And the menu is pretty big. How to choose what you want?! Fortunately I go with close friends, so we share dishes. (I'd highly recommend this plan of attack). \n\nI've sampled the drunken noodles (amazingggg), the country pad Thai (yummy) and the yellow curry with brown rice (quite delicious). Every entree we have gotten costs around $8; not too shabby. The portion sizes, unlike many Asian restaurants, are reasonably sized. In fact; when I got my curry, I thought, \"darn! I won't have leftovers!\" Sure enough... No leftovers... But I left feeling quite satisfied. \n\nMap of Thailand- I will not need a map to find my way back to you again!!!
