[UPDATE 9\/23\/17: After visiting other local shops offering similar but superior ice cream, I have to drop the rating to 2 stars and slightly edit my intro. It's just not worth the time to go here.]\n\nIf you like ice cream and you're looking for a great visit-it-once-then-forget-it place, and you don't want to stand in huge lines, then come here ASAP. If you just want decent ice cream, then forget it.\n\nRolled Ice Cream is a soon-to-be-chain (5 existing or planned stores) that offers an interpretation of a relatively new Thai street food, and it's exactly as it says on the label. It's kinda like Coldstone, but they actually make the ice cream instead of just mixing in some ingredients to existing ice cream. Their first location was too far and therefore too time-consuming for a Henderson resident such as yours truly, and that notion was compounded after I heard about the eternally long lines. They did bring a booth to the most recent Great American Foodie Fest (Henderson location), but I had other priorities at that time.\n\nThat's why I had to jump when I heard about the soft opening of their second location, in the gargantuan Sansone Park Place plaza on Eastern near the Richmar traffic signal. It's flanked by Paul Mitchell and Budget on the left and The Joint and GlutenZero on the right. It's pretty spacious inside, and I was surprised that they had just bar seating and no indoor tables at all (two outdoor tables with benches). Unless they still haven't received all of their furniture, that looks like either a huge waste of space or perhaps smart planning for the lines which will surely grow as word spreads. I guess it hasn't yet because it didn't take long at all during any part of my visit.\n\nThe cash register for placing orders is deep inside, while the five prep stations are all increasingly closer to the door. You can see all the toppings in plain sight, including a cereal station between the two stations nearest to the register. You can also see the TV-screen menus, which are all entirely preset combinations of cream bases and add-ons\/toppings. Stand in line to order, choose whichever item you want and in the large size (small is only 50 cents cheaper), and wait for one of the employees to call out your name and order so that you can step up to the station and watch the show.\n\nThat show is really the main reason to come here. You get to see them work on super-cold flat surfaces. They may start by chopping up part of your order's ingredients (definitely the case for fruit), then they'll measure out and pour refrigerated cream base onto the surface and start\/continue to scrape\/mix the product. About a minute later, they'll spread it all thinly in a flat rectangle then cut out and roll the ice cream up into the cylindrical spirals that comprise your final order. Whipped cream and other garnishes aside, that's about it.\n\nI got the large \"Banana Split\" ($6.49) and requested that the cherry (maraschino) be placed on top. Somehow, roller dude got the idea to put a slice of banana and strawberry each on top as well, so I had a trio of fresh fruit garnishes above the whipped cream which I also accepted. The star is supposed to be the ice cream, but part of that is having the right utensil for the job. They have only freaking soup spoons here? WTF? At least give me a normally-shaped spoon with a decent tip, or a fork, or anything that can cut.\n\nAfter the ice cream started to soften enough and I got deep enough into my bowl that I wasn't afraid of spilling ice cream bits, I start really getting into my dessert. It did take a while to thaw, which means it might survive a short car trip in hot weather. Maybe a small plus for locals? Even with the large size, I didn't leave feeling that satisfied with the portion, so I guess that's a plus if you're watching your waistline.\n\nTexture and flavor were both fine, but nothing special. Texture-wise, you do get the impression of a lot of layers of frozen stuff, but it's not comparable to something like shaved snow. I didn't detect many ice crystals, so the consistency was fine, but the creaminess just wasn't there until you let it melt quite a bit. Flavor-wise... well, it was largely dominated by the chocolate syrup, so it was a little hard to distinguish the cream base and the fruit flavors aside from the garnishes. The whipped cream is generic spray can stuff, so it's nothing to write home about either. The execution seemed fine, so it's more likely that something about the cream base or the process doesn't result in a delicious dessert.\n\nRolled Ice Cream is a unique visual experience. Unfortunately, it's tied to an eating experience that falls about as flat as the dessert does in that pre-rolling step. Aside from the novelty and the visual appeal, it doesn't measure up to other ice cream renditions, including the frozen custard spot a short walk away and various places around the city that are truly drive-worthy.
