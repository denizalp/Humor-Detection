Not worth the price!!!\nWe were here after we left the Adult Entertainment Expo in January and i have to say this is the most over rated gentleman's club in Vegas! When something is promoted as the worlds largest strip club with the highest stripper to customer ratio, your natural urge is to go experience it. Don't do it! \n\nIt really hurts to give a strip club only two stars but having to continue ordering $10 well drinks and get half ass lap dances to keep your table and or chair is ridiculous. After ordering two rounds of drinks and no dances, the manager told us we had to get up and give the table to people who wanted lap dances. If they are forcing people to pay these girls I would prefer some attractive natural ones not the ugly plastic. But hell it is Vegas!
