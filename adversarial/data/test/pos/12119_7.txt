i've gone here numerous times since my initial review, and only one time could've redeemed the initial low rating.  was here again and gave the woman 2.22 for my 2.17 bill and after she left and did something else for about 2 minutes despite the fact that i was otherwise all set, I finally got 3 pennies back.  2 cents isn't a huge deal, but it just is indicative of this BK's service
