Maybe 3.5 stars would be a better representation of my lunchtime visit to Cherry Blossom. I came in for lunch after discussing a friends recent trip to Tokyo I was just dying for some Ramen. The restaurant was surprisingly slow for noon on a Friday but it quickly filled up by the end of my visit. I ordered the Cha-shu ramen with a boiled egg. The pork was good but not great, and was missing that rich fatty texture that I love so much. The noodles were fine, nothing to write home about. And the boiled egg was just a plain hard boiled egg. I was expecting the Ajitsuke Tamago but that may have just been my mistake. Either way it didn't add anything to the dish. I must say though the broth was killer. I know Ramen is highly dependent on the broth but I feel like it shouldn't be the only great part of the meal. Service was good, you definitely don't come here for a show but they do the job efficiently and with a smile.
