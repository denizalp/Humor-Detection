Came to Pho 72 on a regular weekday for lunch. It's in the same plaza from Sunny Foodmart, so if you're on the way to grab groceries, might as well stop in Pho 72 for a bowl of pho.\n\nThere's parking on the outside, it's rarely ever completely full, but you might have to park a little further back. Pho 72 has a very small store front, but when you walk inside, it's actually quite long and impressive for it's size. There are tables on both sides offering very comfortable seating.\n\nThe menus were already all set on the tables, and we were seated immediately. For this restaurant, you have to write down the number and quantity of what you order (standard pho restaurants). Service was really fast and food came out fairly fast.\n\nThe Pho Beef noodle soups came in two sizes (medium for $8.75 and large for $9.85) for whichever bowl you ordered. We decided to get the medium. It was a standard medium compared to other pho places, it might even be compared to a small in a few places. The pho itself was okay. In my opinion, the broth wasn't hot enough, and the beef was a little rough (very lean instead of fatty).\n\nWe ordered one of the broken rice dishes too (they were roughly $10 for a plate). We got the broken rice with chicken and fresh non-cooked egg on top. The broken rice tasted really good and the chicken was really tasty too. I would have thought this was one of the better dishes, with the exception of the egg. For some reason, the egg tasted a little funny to me (my mom thought the egg was a little old and it had a funny odour to it). Maybe a cooked egg option would be ideal if I get it another time?\n\nThe spring rolls were standard, I was amazed that there was the option of 4 spring rolls, though it also made sense because these spring rolls were smaller than typical Vietnamese pho places.\n\nOverall, the food was okay for me. I really enjoy pho places with hot broth and good meat. The egg also smelt a little odd to us, but maybe it's just this particular time that we went? It was an okay experience.
