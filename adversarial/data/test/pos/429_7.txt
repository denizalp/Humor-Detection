This Sonic is the WORST I've ever been to. My HUGE ISSUE with this location is, they lie and expect the public to believe their nonsense. I enjoy Sonic Ice and have made the decision, as of last evening, to buy my own ice maker that makes the small chewable ice I enjoy so much. \n\nFor the last TWO YEARS, this Sonic location has been telling customers during the summer that \"We can't sell you ice, our ice maker is broken and we won't have enough for customers drinks if we sell it to you!\" Wow, TWO YEARS AND YOU HAVEN'T FIXED YOUR ICE MAKER!? \n\nLet's get the facts laid bare here. Sonic, including this location advertises \"We Sell Ice, Grab A Bag!\" They even have a stupid little sign they finally took down around the drive through speaker that states \"Get Your Bag Of Ice!\" \n\nI went to this location at 10:45pm yesterday and they close at midnight. I asked for just one bag of ice and received the stupid line yet again. The most annoying part of this stupid lie they tell is, when it's winter or breakfast time, no problem, you can buy ice! What I end up having to do, if I want Sonic ice, is drive three miles to the next location where they NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM selling me Ice!!! I can ask for Six Bags and have, NO PROBLEM!!! \n\nTo this Sonic Franchise Owner (Imbecile)...\nStop instructing your employees to lie to customers and simply take down the bag of ice off the menu, scrape the window advertisement for ice and then place a giant sign including a message on your window \"We Don't Sell Ice At This Location, Don't Ask For It, We Hate Our Customers Asking For Something Every Other Sonic Location Sells!\" \n\nOption #2 (If the ice maker is broken,) FIX YOUR ICE MAKER, IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS!\" \n\nOption #3 BUY A SECOND ICE MACHINE THAT'S SMALLER, BUT ALLOWS THOSE WHO WANT TO BUY ICE, TO DO SO!!! \n\nOption #4 Since you don't mind lying to your customers, you shouldn't have a problem lying to your insurance company. Wait until 3:00am and burn your store down! You're obviously a horrible business owner or a liar, either way, you shouldn't be conducting business this way. \n\nWho hasn't seen the giant Sonic Marketing Campaign with the two idiots that always go to Sonic and one of them does or says something stupid to make you think Sonic is a great place to grab food and treats! \n\nYou the Franchisee should understand that the portion of your profits that go back to corporate, pay for this marketing and you're blowing it! \n\nAs you can see, I'm frustrated and angry. I can't stand liars, cheats and thieves.
