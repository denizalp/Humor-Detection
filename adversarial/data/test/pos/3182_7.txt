This REI has enough space to display everything they sell. They also have enough clerks so that you can find someone quickly if you have a question about the merchandise.\n\nIf you are in downtown Phoenix, it is quite a drive as it is not very close to any convenient freeway, the 51 being the closest. However, if you are in the neighborhood, this is a great store to find everything you need for camping, hiking, climbing and biking. It is not designed as a runners' store. \n\nParking is easy with a good-sized parking lot.
