Hello Centry Link, before you go on to a neighbors house and think you can run a cable from my house to there's and I won't cut that shit! ASK FIRST...How would you feel if you came home and saw a wire going across your yard then into the neighbors house.\nNeedless to say you already put a bad taste in my mouth about the new neighbor cause that tool came to my door like I was supposed to be cool with it, I would never run any type of cables to a neighbors house with out explaining why and getting permission first. I guess that's why I have never had you as a provider and never will, I have never heard anything good about your service, and now I also know you have no common sense, people etiquette or respect for other people property!
