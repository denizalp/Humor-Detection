Ah, Groupon. The things you'll make us do. \n\nSo, yes. The hotel Isabella is an interesting place. It gets the two stars awarded for convenience and comfort.  By convenience, I mean it is located just off of the subway route.  By comfort, I mean that the bed I was in was firm an afforded a good night's sleep. \n\nIt fails to get any more stars because of the rest of the room. \n\nThe closet, for example. It doesn't have one. It has a crossbar with a set of clothes hangers on it (the theft proof kind). I never realized that a good closet was important to me. It is. \n\nThe bathroom is the cakeiest part to take a cake. It has a standard door. When you open this door, you can wash your hands and step into the shower.\n\nHey, what other task do people usually want to do in the bathroom? Did you say \"use the toilet?\"  I hope so, because otherwise we have opposing biological imperatives. \n\nIf you want to use the toilet, you have to step into the shower, close the door, and then walk towards the toilet. Now, I'm no architect.  I've never designed a building. But I think that the option of, say, using a sliding door in the wall instead would have been a much better idea.\n\nThe continental breakfast is very continental.  There was fruit, coffee, cereal and juice.\n\nI can't see myself returning to the Isabella, especially at their base room rates.  Another well-timed Groupon (I needed to crash after watching Wrestlemania at a friend's place) might do it,  but I'm pretty ambivalent about that.
