Okay, so I\"m craving an Italian sandwich.  You know.  The kind with ham, salami, capocollo, mortadella, pepperoni, and\/or other meats and cheeses?  It is about my favorite sub.  It's also hard to find one in this neighborhood.  Enter My Slice.  Well, I've had their pizza and I was not really impressed, but maybe they do sandwiches better?  Sadly, I don't think so.\n\nSo anyway, the Italian sandwich came on a bolilllo roll.  Ham, salami and pepperoni with red onion, roasted red pepper, pepperoncini and provolone cheese.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.  On a bright note, it was accompanied with a quite large salad of fresh greens, crouton and shaved Parmesan.\n\nFinally, huge banner over the front and painted on the window, #1 Pizzaria on Yelp!.  I'm thinking you can do a search for a pizzaria and find ten with higher ratings and many more reviews.  PIzzaria Bianco comes to mind, a place that has won several awards including a James Beard, a 29 Zagat rating and has been proclaimed the number one pizza in America.  1773 reviews with an average 4 stars, is not something to spit on.\n\nNote:  the owner wrote me and claims that if you put \"pizza\" in the search, his restaurant comes up first. Yes, but do search results determine popularity, or is it number of reviews\/stars?  Regardless, while it may be true, I think it is a bit disingenuous and misleading, but that is his call.  Subtract 1 star.
