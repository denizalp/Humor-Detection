We'll I was interested in trying a new burger and after driving by this place a few times figured I'd give it a shot.  Ordered a single chili cheeseburger got a regular cheeseburger.  The bun was soggy from the tomatoes and possibly the pickle as well.  So I took those off and it went down, pickles were the most memorable thing about the burger, pretty sad.  Also got the chili cheese fries or so I thought I got a Shyte colored paste resembling well diarrhea but thicker and pastier if that is a word.
