My last doctor was great and I loved her but I moved to the East Valley and had to establish a new doc closer to home.  I came to see Dr. Czerkes for a checkup and I couldn't have picked a better doctor.  He has a great bedside manner and his nurse, Maria, was friendly and makes a great first impression as far as the medical staff is concerned.   \n\nNothing bad to report with this office, everything was clean, everyone was friendly, I'll be back next year!
