Great outdoor seating, but that's it. \nService is terrible. We ordered several different items. Everything came at the same time. Sandwich, salads and few appetizers and of course the apps were cold. \nWe ordered a ginger soda. The sever didn't tell they don't offer it and went and poorer it from \"the bar area\" and came in 6oz glass. \nAfter one refill we had to pay $12.45 for it. Her explanation was that they don't have a\nBartender for the servers today and she had to go to the bar and get it from there.\nDidn't bring all this the to the management. They looked very careless about everything anyway.  One lady came out of no where and ask as how was everything without presentation of who she is etc. just send her away with quick ok.  Her clothes were covered with bunch of anal hair and i even didn't want to talk to her. \nWe live in Vegas and we go out at least few\nTimes a week and for Vegas standards this place its a disappointment. Sorry
