So...I had been to a couple of different Freddy's throughout the Phoenix area, but had never been to this one.  This one is the closest one to my house, and I decided to come here for lunch.  I saw an advertisement for a green chile burger, and also that they had fried pickles as a side.  Sign me up!  Drove down to the drive thru and placed my order of a green chile burger combo with fried pickles as my side and a Mountain Dew to drink.  Here is how everything was...........\n\nGreen Chile Burger-  Freddy's uses the \"smush\" technique for their burgers.  They squash them down really flat with the spatula so the edges get nice and crispy and hang over the edge of the bun.  My burger came with two 2oz patties, some nice grilled onions, some mustard, cheese and a fair amount of green chiles.  The taste was very good.  The cheese was melted perfectly, the onions and green chiles were nice and pliable\/soft and the patties tasted fine.  Maybe not the best green chile burger I have ever had, but for a fast food type place, it was pretty solid.\n\nFried Pickles-  These things were great!  They were little pickle chips, breaded and deep fried.  They had a great crunchy batter on them and were delicious!  I would definitely get them again!\n\nService in the drive thru was great!  The lady who took my order was extremely chipper and happy, and the guy that handed me my food was all smiles and thanked me for coming in (it was sincere, too...I can spot a bullshit reaction from miles away).  It was a good change of pace compared to other burger type spots, and I'm sure I will be back at some point in the future.
