Dined here for breakfast with an out of town guest, wanting specifically to have a nice Sunday breakfast downtown.\n\nImpressions:\n\nPros:\n1) Easy to make reservations online but entirely unnecessary for a 9:30am breakfast on this Sunday as it's not all that busy except for some soccer families.\n2) The continental breakfast is good and reasonable enough -- juice, 3 pastries, fruit for 16.00.\n3)  The Water pitcher is adorable -- a silver frog pitcher.  According to our server, you can purchase one through their website, though I couldn't find it there.\n\nCons:\n1) Entire inside of this hotel is exceptionally freezing cold -- the lobby and the restaurant.  Very uncomfortable.\n2) The breakfast buffet looks amazing but I'm not really in the mood to pay $30 for my breakfast no matter how good or extensive it might be.\n4) A-la-carte pancakes (14.00), bacon (6.00), juice (?)  would be close to the buffet price.\n5) Our totals bill with tax and tip included was $80.00 for three of us -- for breakfast?  Really? \n6) Most importantly for the 2 star rating:  My husband was ill after dining on their corned beef hash.  He mentioned that it didn't taste right but he continued to eat it and didn't return it to the kitchen, unfortunately.  He did call and let them know once we returned home.
