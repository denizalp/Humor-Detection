The only way I can explain why this restaurant is still open is that the owner(s) have so much money that they can keep injecting cash to it. No way a restaurant this size with so few clients can survive.  We come very often because we like the hummus and the lentil soup, and lately the kabobs are pretty good. \nThe service is a hit or miss, and you can tell they have a tremendous turn over because you really never see the same people. \nThey changed from being a sit down restaurant to a fast food where they shout your number once its ready (even they have an electronic display). The last change is that after 9:30pm  it's only take out (probably they don't want to wash dishes after closing) and now they close at 10, which during Ramadan is a very bad idea. \nWe will keep coming for the soup and hummus but I won't be surprised if one day is finally closed. They really need a manager that puts some order and discipline in this restaurant, since the idea of the menu and the place itself is a very good one, and the quality of the food is good for the price paid, but this is not a place I would really recommend to a close friend, because you never know if it will be good, due to the lack of consistency. \nI was hesitating on giving a 2 star, but as said, we come pretty often, and I want to think 3 stars is my minimum. \nSincerely hoping that the owners find a real store manager that can keep the discipline, cleanliness and consistency of the service and food.
