I'm new to the Phoenix area but found out that Deerhoof was playing a show here. I'm from Seattle so I expected the place to be packed but it was a surprisingly small crowd which was actually refreshing for once. As for the venue itself, it's your basic dark, gross music venue. That isn't an insult. Considering the staff, I assume a lot of punk shows happen here. Would I go back for a show? Absolutely. Though on a minor note, if the bathroom has to be that gross could they at least put some soap in the dispenser?
