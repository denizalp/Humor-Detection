Alright, you get the point from all the other reviews that this joint can fire up a kick ass pizza so let me tell you about the best thing on the menu,... The Eggplant Parm! It's as good as you can get unless you head to Little Italy.\n\nGlad this place is back on it's feet and hope it can continue to earn the business and great reviews. More importantly, I hope the Scottsdale elite wannabes will continue to take their misbehaving kids to that Romper Room pizza joint in DC Ranch and keep this pace brat free!
