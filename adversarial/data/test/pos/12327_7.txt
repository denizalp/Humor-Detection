This is one of my favorite places to travel to.  \n\nThat being said...this is for Terminal 3 it is just A-OK. Seems like the construction will never end to get to the twenty-first century.  It is an older terminal without a doubt, not much in the way of offerings after security. Just a Mexican cantina, a Wendy's and a newsstand while you wait. \n\nMy biggest problem though is they keep giving my wife issues at TSA.  Quite honestly the pat down here can be considered offensive,  though they do offer to take the person to an area out of sight.  From my point of view TSA operates with different sets of guidelines in each airport.  \n\nThey have several nice shops before you enter security like a Starbucks, a PGA shop and bookstore.  If you get there early enough you can enjoy a nice cup of coffee before going through. \n\nWelcome to the Valley of the Sun.  As always, safe travels and enjoy your flight.
