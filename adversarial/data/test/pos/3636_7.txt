I am the most massive fan of The Bay Queen Street (aka Eaton Centre location)'s lingerie department and that's what this review is all about. \n\nThey have the BEST selection, the best sales and the absolute best fitting rooms. And you can shop in peace without any salesperson ever bothering you!\n\nHead up the escalator to the fourth floor and prepare for a massive sensory overload as you're faced with thousands upon thousands of knickers, nightgowns and bras that are either nicely hung up on racks and organized by brand, or placed in slotted dividers on discount tables for dirt cheap. They sell everything from Calvin Klein and Wonderbra to Joe Boxer, Elita and Arianne. \n\nThey have lacy, fancy bras hanging on hooks or racks, sports bras on shelves and then the regular boxed bras that your mom probably wears and you have to kind of have to guess at. Pretty much anything you'd be looking for in a lingerie store, in any size or style.\n\nThen, once you've got an armload of undercrackers and bras to try on, waltz (literally - OK, maybe not) to the fitting rooms, AKA THE HAVEN OF BLISS, and hand an unlimited number of items to the fitting room attendant. No restrictions, no \"you're not allowed to try those on\" rules, and no one bothering you. There's a boudoir\/sitting area for your man (if you came with one) and each fitting room has a floor to ceiling mirror and is massive with lots of room to groove in your new jams.
