Stopped in with the GF after a day of exploring the area.  Consorted the oracle that is yelp on the smart phone and decided to pop and give Kavanaugh's a shot.  Not much happening here on a Monday afternoon.  I originally thought this was good thing while hoping for top notch service..waiting to be seated..and waited to be seated.  When the hostess (slash) waitress arrived it was hard to be angry with her, so I let it go.  \n\nWe ordered up a couple of Black & Tans which seemed a bit lit after the foam settled.  Hoping for a decent \"HH\" special were told the only special was something about domestics (beers) being discounted and that was about it.  After reviewing the website, I see that there might be a little bit more to it.\n\nThe menu looked alright and so we ordered.  The GF had French Dip w\/ waffle fries and I had the Morrissey Melt which was turkey, ham and not so crispy bacon, cheese, onion and sourdough bread.  I little soggy towards the bottom but other wise, it was alright.\n\nThe food was alright and might bring us back again to try something else but as for the rest it was A-OkK.
