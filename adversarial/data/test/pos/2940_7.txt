As a beginner triathlete, I was in desperate need of a road bike....especially since I have a few races already on the calendar.  I'm a swimmer, I'm a runner, but I'm NOT a biker......so the whole idea was intimidating.  As was the idea of buying a road bike.  BUT, after saving up and doing some research I was off....  \n\nFirst stop, Landis.  I entered the store and was greeted by a person at the counter.  When I said I wanted to buy a road bike (making it clear I was here to purchase and not just browse), he went to find another person to help me.  I was asked my price range, and yes, I get it, $900 doesn't get me fancy but hey, I didn't want fancy.  He couldn't show me anything on the floor in my size, so he called the Scottsdale store to see their availability.  After maybe 10 mins he comes back to tell me they have the least expensive Trek bike for women but it's in a box and not built.  \n\nOkaaaaay......???\n\nSilence from my sales associate.\n\nFinally he says, well, you could have them build it for you and call you when it's done.\n\nOkaaaay.....???\n\nSilence from my sales associate.  \n\nOkaaaaay.....thanks for your help.\n\n\nI can only describe this customer service as snobby and uninterested.  Sorry I'm a beginner.  Sorry I'm not a man.  Sorry I don't have $1500 to spend on a road bike.  But I was there to buy, and was very disappointed in the way I was treated.\n\nSide note:  At my second stop, Performance Bike (see review), I encountered another woman buying a road bike who had been to Landis earlier that day.  And we both received the same customer service.  Apparently, women who are beginners are not welcome there.  Very disappointing.
