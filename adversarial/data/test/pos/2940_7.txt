the view is amazing.  and the lounge itself is actually very nice.\n\nBUT...\n\n$25 cover for guys on the guestlist [$40 if you're not]...free for ladies though.\n\nAND\n\nNO DANCING.\n\nit sucked so much that this venue had a really good DJ spinning good dance music, while completely omitting the worst songs on the radio. [no LMFAO or BEP]]  how could you play that type of music and forbid dancing?\n\nwould i come again?\n\nafter getting a sex change so i don't have to pay cover...maaaaybeeee...
