Five gin drinks, six appetizers and Mix Master Mark = One fun event (carry the headache)\n\nI am not a Gin drinker.  However, after tasting the cocktails we created at this event I am adding Hendrick's gin to my bar.  I also enjoyed sipping the gin straight which was smooth and subtly complex. It was cool to taste the flavor different garnishes brought out of the gin. \n\nI think the deal with this kind of event is Yelpers get a no-cost event and the vendor gets the possibility of positive social media and word of mouth.  In that \"spirit\" Hendrick's Gin is a good fit for Yelpers who imbibe.  The company puts an emphasis on style and uniqueness, just like Yelpers.  As soon as you see the apothecary bottle it is clear they care about heritage and enjoy being old school. This is a quirky fun drink for awesome people.
