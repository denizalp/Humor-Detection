Everybody here either:\n\nA. Hates their life\nB. Hates their job\nC. Hates their life because of their job\n\nService has gotten marginally better over time, and given that Greyhound operates what I can safely call the worst website in earth, I can understand the frustration they must experience when EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER probably complains about the massive discrepancies between their online prices and their ACTUAL prices, but still, a bit of a smile wouldn't kill them.\n\nHands down one of the worst companies I've ever done business with.\n\nWhere's the zero stars button?
