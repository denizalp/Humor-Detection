Look, I'll cut to the chase.....Taco trucks in the parking lot of gas stations have a certain, let's just say stigma about them.  You know, the whole \"roach coach\" thing? \n\nThat does not apply to Tacos Nayarit!  This food truck is wonderful.  I consider myself a foodie who is not scared to try anything and I love a good, authentic place to get some Mexican food.  This fits the bill.  Walking up can be a bit intimidating since there is a lot of Spanish on the menu but the nice ladies inside speak English and can certainly take care of you.  \n\nWhat I like about this truck is the variety!  When you go to the \"other\" sit down Mexican places you get chicken or beef for your protein.  That's it, you know what I'm talking about \"I'll have the #3 chicken and refried beans is what you can hear most people ordering.  Not at Nayarit!  They have everything \"Asada, Carnitas, Chorizo, Pollo, etc...\" They also have other more adventurous fillings like Lengua.  \n\nI've had the burrito with asada & chorizo and they are excellent.  The meats are cooked and spiced well along with the other fillings and rolled perfectly.  These ladies know what they're doing.  I've also had the different tacos which have wonderfully fresh cilantro and onions to make them the best in the area.  They provide little cups of salsa verde and another \"red sauce\" which is quite possibly the hottest stuff south of Ballantyne so be careful.  They give you a lime wedge and some sort of hot pepper along with a smidge of grilled onions.\n\nIf you have a hankering for something authentic and tasty I suggest pulling into the gas station or the sketchy cigar bar parking lot when the windows up and giving this place a try.  Please try to be orderly with your parking so you don't have a fender bender!
