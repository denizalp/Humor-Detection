Came here last year for a Bloody Mary and I remembered that it was one of the best that I've ever had, so I decided to bring my husband back with me this time around to give it a try.  We both ordered the bloody mary and an appetizer to share since we just came back from lunch.\n\n- Bloody Mary - there tomato juice is so fresh and you can definitely taste all the spices that goes into the drink.  It's topped off with a pickled carrot, green bean as well as an olive and piece of cheddar cheese.  Definitely a must try here!\n\n- Fried pickles - this was deep fried and came with 3 different sauces. It was like a blue cheese, thousand island and bbq kind of sauce.  The pickles were sweet, not at all sour, so I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy husband loved the Bloody Mary and was happy that we made the right choice in stopping by here.  We were staying at Aria Hotel, so it was conveniently located right in between the lobby and mall!  The staff was friendly and I absolutely enjoyed our bartender.  We will have to come back and try the food next time!
