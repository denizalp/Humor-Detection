$9.00 for a jumbo gyro? You betcha! I'll do it again and again (my wife and I split it).. What you've got to worry about is talking to people after the taste explosion in your mouth. Surely, if you are at the West Side Market, go get a gyro from Steve's. Stand in line (smell the fish) if you have to. Not one for gyros? Try Steve's, it may change your mind.
