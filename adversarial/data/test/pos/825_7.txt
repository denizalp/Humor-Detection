This is a hidden gem. Inside Lowe's Plaza just left of Homegoods in the corner of Eastern and St. Rose Pkwy. A few of my coworkers go here for their dogs and love this store. I even saw a elderly couple carry their huge poodle out like a baby and hop in a very compact corvette. Goes to show.. if you love your dog, you'll shop here ;)\n\nThis store has everything.. . with 3,400+ unique items. I was simply amazed how much inventory they carry. All the items were neatly stored in rows. Clutter-free and clean aisles. I can see why they won the \"Best Pet Store In Las Vegas\" for 2015. \n\nI was greeted as soon as I walked in the door by a few sales associates. The cashier girl asked if I needed help and I asked if they carried any dog car seats. Another male sales associate walked me over to the area and opened a few up to see the size difference. Both asked what kind of dog I have... I told them a Pomeranian. Thinking it was a tiny teacup, they showed me the small at first. I told them mine is like a little lion and I don't think he will fit in that. Then they showed me the medium size and that was it. I'll take it!\n\nA female sales associate asked if there was anything else I was looking for? And before I finished my sentence.. she walked me over to the shampoos\/conditioner section. They had many different brands to choose from. I ended up getting a 2 in 1 Buddy Wash Shampoo and Conditioner for relaxing. The smell is Green Tea and Bergamot. And also for dry skin and itching I picked Earthbath totally natural pet care in Oatmeal and Aloe. The smell is Vanilla and Almond. And they even had South Bark's Blueberry Facial! It's a face wash, body shampoo, and overall brightener. All natural, tearless, aromatherapeutic, ph balanced, safe for dogs and cats. The cashier girl loves this product too and couldn't stop raving about it. I told her my dog loves it too. He looks so relaxed and smiling! I remember using this particular product when I took Mr. Ruffin, my dog on his Birthday to a self wash place. He loved the experience. So I must buy him that Blueberry Facial!!!\n\nHe loves new toys.. so I also found two cute tiny stuffed animals. A pig and lamb :P He likes to carry it in his mouth or sleep on it. \n\nI tried out the dog car seat and it fit him perfectly. Mr. Ruffin just sat down and enjoyed the scenic view of Las Vegas. It was comfortable enough that he didn't move around everywhere and he lied down. So calm and not antsy pantsy ;)\n\nMr. Ruffin's Birthday is tomorrow and I'm sad. I don't want him to grow old so fast :\/ Yet I'm grateful and happy to still have him in my life. He's my joy and this place has it all for him to pamper away with. A dog lover's spot for everything you need. Great service and products with barking joy prices. Spoil your dog, shop here.
