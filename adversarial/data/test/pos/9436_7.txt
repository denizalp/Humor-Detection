While walking along the Fremont Street Experience I noticed the International Eatery food court.  It is located in the Neonopolis building across of Wall greens.  On Tuesday night I walked into the food court for dinner and noticed the pizza booth, the Chinese booth, and the Mexican booth.  I opted to try the Mexican booth. Other customers came into the eatery and they opted for the pizza booth as well as the Mexican booth. The workers at the Chinese booth was luring customers with free samples of pork or chicken to gain business.\n\nAs I was looking at the menu items at DJ's Tacos I noticed MENUDO and asked the server what it is in menudo.  He told me that menudo consisted of tripe and corn.  I told the server that I have been a fan of MENUDO the music group and that I never had menudo the dish. He then offered me a sample of menudo the dish. \n\nI ordered my menudo dish as well as the tacos. Can't go wrong on $2.00 taco. Since there were three small tacos I asked for three different meat fillings. Chicken, pork, and beef with mild sauce topped with lettuce and cheese (there are other topping ingredients for individuals who want more on the tacos).  I also ordered a large beverage drink to go with my meal. \n\nSince the International Eatery is a food court I checked out the public restroom. Both the men and women restrooms are locked and individuals need codes to access the restroom.  I received the code from the server at the Mexican booth. Once I opened the restroom I noticed that the floor was littered in certain spots with paper towel and toilet paper. The toilet stall that I ended up using was out of toilet paper. Really??!?? No toilet paper....loose money. Some previous customers even left their cup drinks on the floor and sink area of the restroom.\n\nOverall it was an average food court with little food booths to choose from.  I just wish the janitors would check up on the restroom area more often.
