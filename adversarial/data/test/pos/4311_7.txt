Never been more disrespected in a barber shop. Sat in the chair told the guy what I wanted. He then tells me to hold on while he goes to the John. After more than five minutes waiting for this clown to take a crap. I got up and left. I will never go here again. Any professional should take care of his business before sitting a customer in the chair. They were not busy. He was sitting on the chair prior to me arriving.
