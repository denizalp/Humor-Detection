First off definitely take advantage of the Yelp free check in cinnamon poppers! Out of this world yummy!!!! My husband and I have been dying to try this place for a while now after hearing about it on diners drive-ins and dives.  I was not disappointed in the quality and taste of the food. Pizza and wings it was with our Yelp poppers, I'm craving it now.  I had a cold piece of the pizza today for lunch two day old and it still satisfied every taste bud! Cold or hot the sauce and crust make it. Not too greasy either. Their wings are flavorful with any sauce and full of meat! The don't come with sauce on but rather give you sauce and a bag to toss yourself.  Our order was take out which I guess most are since there's maybe three tables inside.  We called our order in ahead and waited a few minutes.  I will be ordering from here again for sure!
