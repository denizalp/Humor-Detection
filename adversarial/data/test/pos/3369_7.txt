Girl! Let me tell you I came in here with decent hair and walked out with ugly hair. I wanted a pretty ombr√© and got the \"WTF\" hair. First, I'd like to say I'm sure other stylists are great but dang, na uh, my stylist Cami can't do hair for the life of her. She put her skills on my hair and made me look like I got my hair colored at Fantastic Sam's. Who gets their hair colored at Fantastic Sam's? Exactly. No offense. And last, do not let that woman touch your hair. You can THANK ME later. Save your money or you can request Jenny, Lauren, Amy, or Chita. I'm sure they won't give you the \"WTF\" look. For the price you pay, I'm sure Fantastic Sam's will give the hair I got for cheap. So do yourself a favor and do not have Cami touch your hair.
