Only gave them a star because there is no option for \"0\" or negative stars! I have been going here for about a yr but this last time i had the WORST \"oil change\" experience OF MY LIFE! I will NEVER be back and would advise everyone to reconsider before trusting them with your vehicle!\n\n I recently took my vehicle in for an oil change, and they talked me into doing a 3 point fuel injection cleaning saying that it would help my car run better and give me better gas mileage. I agreed to this service thinking it would help my car, but after they were finished they said they were only able to do part of the service because one of the parts had mesh over it. (So they didn't even do the full 3 point service) \n\nMy car was running perfectly fine and had not given me ANY problems before this service. However, before I even left the parking lot my car was shaking when my foot was on the brake and the check engine light was flashing and beeping. I had to go pick my son up as I could not leave him at school and then immediately proceeded to go back and ask them what they did and if they could fix it... by this time the car's heat gage was beginning to rise. \n\nThey spent about 5 minutes trying to see what was wrong and then told me that they couldn't figure out the issue. They said I should take it next door to Big O tires and if they did something wrong then they would pay for it because they \"stand behind their service 100%.\" \n\nBig O tires took and entire day to run a diagnostics on it and then called to tell me it was a blown head gasket and a misfire in Cylinder 4 and that although it may have been caused by the work they did there's no way to prove it.  I then got a call from Valvoline to let me know that they would not be paying for ANY of my repairs (which total $1,800.00!!!!) because there's no proof they messed up. So what was originally supposed to be a $40 oil change actually ended up costing me over $2,000.00 when you add in the price of the rental car I had to get, the cost of the service and the cost of the repairs... And they never once even offered to refund the money for the botched service they performed.\n\n I would advise everyone to stay far away from this facility!!!!!
