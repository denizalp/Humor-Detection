Southern Fail. The menu for brunch is too weird to be taken seriously. It is basically four po'boy wraps and a host of strange items including trout, biscuits, french toast, gumbo and soup. All items require you to add protein for extra money, but that didn't make sense regarding biscuits, soup and half the stuff on the menu. The food we did eat got below average reviews. Corn Chowder was more like Corn Water soup, the gumbo was unseasoned and tasteless and the Bread Pudding French Toast, despite being the 2nd best dish, was underwhelming at best. It was also $5 for a Mimosa shot. Bloody mary was terrible as well.\n    I suppose we can give them an extra star for the Beignets ($6 for 2), so I guess if I added chicken to the beignets that would have made a meal? It's seriously time to reinvent this menu or  make better use of this place with a new concept. Southern bail.
