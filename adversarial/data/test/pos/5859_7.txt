We will NEVER move ourselves again. Everyone has heard horror stories about crappy movers, things getting stolen or jacked up. Not with these guys.\n\nPROS:\n\nOn-time\nSuper fast\nEfficient\nProfessional\nHelpful\nCost effective\n\nCONS:\n\nOnly that I didn't hire them in the past.\n\nWe couldn't believe how cheap it ended up being. We had a 2300 SQ FT home and we were quoted by other companies about 4 times what it ended up costing.  They gave us tips on how to make it more cost effective, we were seriously blown away. Oh and they charge in 15 minute increments and disclosed all costs (nothing hidden) upfront. They make me want to move again (well not really that part sucked, but they truly made the actual move part cake) !
