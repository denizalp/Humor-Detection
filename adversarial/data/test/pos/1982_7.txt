I am not the most experienced Thai food eater, but I have been on a Thai kick lately and Yupha has been the answer. I am in looooove with the fried rice. Great portion, amazzzing taste. Love at first bite!\n\nI like to compliment it with the sweet and sour entree with tofu. I get it mild and it's plenty spicy for my taste. The sweet and sour is not like that of a Chinese restaurant, but I'm thinking I like it better. It's more like sweet and spice and that is A-OK with me. It is also a generous portion and includes a side of white rice which is delicious when drenched in the sauce.\n\nThe staff has always been incredibly nice and the service is usually pretty speedy. I like the setting of the dining area too, it's usually pretty quiet when I've been in there and it's a relaxing setting.\n\nI would definitely recommend going here to anyone looking for some delicious Thai food!
