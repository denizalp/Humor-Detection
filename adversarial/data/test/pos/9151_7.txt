I'm really confused.  There's all this advertising that this is a new location to which the Swissvale Thriftique and the nearby higher end furniture consignment store (NCJW Home Consignments) moved.  However, here are all these reviews prior to their move so it's not really a new store after all???\n\nAnyway, the higher end consignment furniture store in Swissvale was such a treasure of truly nice, expensive (when new), well made furniture at a good price.  We bought a large china cabinet that I fell in love with from them.  The \"new\" Thriftique at this location is huge.  I'll give it that.  But, beyond that, it's just disappointing to see an itty-bitty section for fine furniture and fine furniture deserves a more special locale than this.  Not impressed at all.  Sad, instead.
