Rolled into town on a Saturday night after driving 16 hours to get here.  The car is dinging some nonsense about oil and coolant.  \n\nSince a used car is less expensive than a brand new auto, I think I'd better give the green car a drink.\n\nIn haste, I top off the coolant with some brand I purchased at the nearest gas station.  Then the panic sets in.\n\nI grab the manual and search the forums on coolant for specific requirements for my maturing road beast.  I think I put in the wrong kind of coolant.  I keep reading about colors and brand specific benefits.\n\nI head to Zimbrick and Bryan is awesome and friendly and patient.\n\nHe takes the coolant supply I have and checks it against the kind the service folks have in bulk.  I'm good for the top off.  No dangers.  Then we talk oil and other road-preparedness details I should not skip.\n\nHe grabs the oil grade I need, checks the levels, complements my ride and I prepare the wallet.  I ask how much I owe.\n\nThe transaction ended with a smile, a handshake and a sincere \"...thanks for visiting Madison, enjoy your time, and have a safe trip....\"\n\nI'm in love.
