Balls are an often unappreciated entity: not here my friends, not here. The guys were super friendly and generously came out to support the Yelp\/Johnny Fontane's Sandy Fundraiser. They brought a bevy of balls along...Zorba (lamb) & the rest are in picture of cool sign (which changed colors to the delight of my raging ADHD) \n\nBeing pescetarian, I had one \"ball\" choice this evening: the much lauded Dragon Balls (spicy tuna with a spicy sauce) the inside reminded me more of crab cakes, but I enjoyed the flavor profile. My only problem was one of the (3) balls was so rock hard, it was impenetrable and inedible, at $9 ordinarily I'd have returned it (and am quite sure the guys would have gladly given me another one of their balls) but since this was a charity event, I let it go. The sweet potato tots ($3) were a delicious, huge portion I shared with fellow philanthropic Yelpers. \n\nMisti got the Barnyard Pimp Sticks (gargantuan portion of barbecued pulled chicken over thin crispy fries) that she enjoyed; smelled and looked fantastic. Tien also had the Dragon Balls and I know Mario and many other Yelpers hit up the truck for more ball offerings throughout the night. \n\nSo, while my one wayward ball was disappointing: in all, I found the food tasty, the service on point (and very kind) so I rounded up and look forward to tasting more of their balls in the future: blue balls and falafel are on my radar. \n\nThanks again for sharing your unique and creative balls and supporting a great cause. They also take credit cards = score! \n\n(note: this entire review had my inner inappropriate teenager giggling thinking of Alec Baldwin SNL Schweddie Balls skit, not a bad thing at all :)
