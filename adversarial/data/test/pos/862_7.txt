Man...I feel like a.....MAN!  \n\nShania Twain is ending her residency at the Caesar's Palace Colosseum with the wrap of 2014, and was I so happy our state had super discounted government employee tickets to this show!  Amazing!\n\nI've like Shania Twain since my college years, was a newbie to that which is 'country' music.  Back in the late 90's (now I sound old) I was a freshman to UNLV and was introduced to that steel guitar twang.  Garth Brooks?  Who?  Toby Keith?  Huh?  Diamond Rio?  Eh?  Reba?  What?  Shania Twain?  Yes please!\n\nWas so excited to finally catch one of her last few months of performances on the Las Vegas stage.  What an honor!  Shania wasn't one of the world's best selling artists of ALL TIME for nothing!  The lady can sing!  She can perform!  She can wear tiny little tight-fitting leopard pants with a fur coat!  Not bad for a Canadian, eh?  LOL\n\nShania's 'The Woman In Me' is one of my favorite albums EVER.  Yes.  Me.  EVER.  I've listened to that album so many times I've got most of the songs on it memorized.  Yea I listen to rap, hip-hop, R&B, Pop, even contemporary Hawaiian music but that country album of hers is just special.  It's awesome.  Inspiring.  Crazy.  How can you not hum the chorus to \"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\"  Or meander along with #1 hits \"(If You're Not in it for Love) I'm Outta Here\", \"No One Needs to Know\" or, \"You Win My Love\"?  What about international hits from Shania's pop breakthrough 'Come on Over'?  Don't tell me you can't sing along with mega hits \"That Don't Impress Me Much\", and of course \"Man!  I Feel Like a Woman!\".  And you know you love sappy ballads \"You're Still the One\", and \"From This Moment On\".  Well, at least I do.  \n\nShania:  Still the One has all of these songs is live format!  So much time and work all into one 2 hour jolly good show!  Shania aims to please with this concert run of hers, and she is no slouch.  She's engaging, highly entertaining, and very friendly!  She ran into the crowd at least 3 times during her set, and gladly shook hands with folks, gave hugs, and even selfies!  All while singing LIVE at the same time!  Takes some talent and a big set of lungs to be able to do all that each show.  She is definitely a giver, and very gracious to her fans.  It is a BIG show, lots of lights, lots of airplay, lots of dancers, lots of large set pieces.  I liked how themes were brought in for many of Shania's songs, totally set the mood and the pacing for the concert.  The saloon type buildings brought out for \"I Ain't No Quitter\", and the desert background for \"That Don't Impress Me Much\" were some of my faves.  Gotta say, for being near 50 years old, that body of hers is still rockin'!  Shania's a hard worker and it shows.\n\nOur seats were right smack near the middle, wish we were closer but luckily wifey and I had no problem seeing the stage from where we were located.  Wifey is more of a down-low fan of Shania, but me?  I'm out of that closet, baby!  One of the very rare times I may sing along and jump up and down with giddy glee at a concert (mind you, I am 250 pounds of pure dude).  I really, really had a great time at Shania.  \n\nDon't be stupid...go see Shania before she's no longer in Las Vegas!  It impressed me much!
