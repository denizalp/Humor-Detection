Yeah, they're $8, but unless you're looking for a shitty tour of the Vegas strip while you drive around for an hour (or more) to get to your hotel, you should probably choose a damn taxi. I'm so pissed someone told me these guys were a good idea, and I am hoping this review helps you choose absolutely any other means of transport! AVOID!
