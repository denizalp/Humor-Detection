If you want ramen that is on point with flavor and noodles that are cooked to perfection, then come to Momofuku at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas located on the 2nd floor.  The pork ramen broth was very flavorful, not too salty or oily, just the right amount of that Momofuku flavor.  The appetizers were tasty as well: the soft boiled egg, the pork meatballs, and the Benton ham.  My favorite was the soft boiled eggs which had salmon roe and though there were only four, I could've had like 2 more, it was that good:)  The bartendar, Josh, was nice enough to whip up an original concoction deriving from his Oxnard strawberry roots called \"The Field of Dreams\" which had bourbon, strawberry, and a hint of basil that highlighted the drink to make it a sweet yet light summer drink.  Excellent service (especially to our servers Carlos and Shar), clean restaurant, fun ambience, and cool music to excite the taste buds!  So go to Momofuku and get ready for the mind of chef, David Chang, to blow your mind with Asian flavor persuasion;)
