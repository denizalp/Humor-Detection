I was ecstatic to step foot into my all time favorite chef's restaurant for the first time. Heard amazing reviews about this place... the place is aesthetically pleasing. So to start we got their buffalo chicken wings for the appetizer.. which was okay.. very average... then our entrees came along which was a filet mignon, a prime dry aged NY strip steak with a side of potato purée.. first off, the 8oz filet mignon was barely the size of my palm... it was the tiniest steak I've ever seen... secondly, our steaks were suppose to be cooked medium but it ended up being very well done. They mixed up our orders with the table across from us. Without being said, my boyfriend switched his order of mignon to the NY Strip I had. Once they brought us our \"medium\" steaks it was still ridiculously dry. Then after tasting the steak.. we dipped our tongue into the potato purée which looked extremely creamy and heavenly.... but guess what?! There was a piece of plastic found inside of our dish! The waitress was extremely kind and gave us  ~50\/60% off for all the inconveniences that occurred. I'm the one to pay and tip generously.. even though everything should have been free.. waiting for the chefs to remake my food a thousand times. Overall.. It was BLOODY HELL.
