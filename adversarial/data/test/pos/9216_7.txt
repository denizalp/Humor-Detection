This is my first time to lucky foo and as an avid foodie and after seeing them on Instagram I wanted to give them try. \n\nFrom walking in it looks like a cool place, modern seating updated fixtures and a chill atmosphere. \n\nWe were allowed to seat ourselves which was fine and wasn't really a problem. The problem was the lack of attention and service that we received. It took at least 10 minutes till someone asked if we had drink orders in yet. And overall all the servers seem uninterested in helping. Working in hospitality I think I just had a higher standard especially for a nice place like this. \nWhen you had as little customers as they had only 5-6 other tables is when servers should be trying to take extra care of their customers not check on them every 15 minutes \n\nI think that if they just went over their manners it would go a long way. A simple please, thank you and your welcome goes a long way. The only server who actually responded to my thank you with a your welcome instead of a k was \"James\" also the only server to introduce himself \n\n\nThe food is pretty good the miso ramen was the best I would recommend it! The portions are alittle small side \n\nOverall I think that this negative experience  would make me not come back, but I think everyone has off days but overall when you work in the service industry regardless of how you feel you gotta suck it up and put your customers first. Something management should really focus on. \n\nI'll be trying it again in a few months hopefully it'll be better next time
