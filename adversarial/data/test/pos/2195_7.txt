T&M was suggested to us by our realtor, whom had been coming here for 6 years. I was referred to Nick, but really all of the guys there are fantastic. They confirmed my diagnosis of janky rotors and calipers, offered to smog our vehicle to help with the registration process and didn't gouge us on price. I feel that what we paid for the work that had to be done was VERY reasonable and will absolutely continue to bring our Scion there whenever there is an issue. \n\nOH! I ALMOST FORGOT! While I was waiting for a ride to pick us up, I had to use the bathroom - I prepared myself for the worst - but experienced the best!! There are separate men\/women bathrooms - and they are SO VERY CLEAN. A vanity, more than full-length mirror, smells great, I wasn't afraid to touch things. It was fantastic :)
