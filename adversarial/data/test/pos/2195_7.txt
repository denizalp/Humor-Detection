Went here to have my car fixed, these guys took over a month to figure out the issue, replaced several parts before finding the issue. After charging me over $3000, my car is still F**k up.  They go get parts from the junk yard and tell you they are new. I wouldn't let these people work on bicycle, power wheel, or a hot wheel car, let alone a car. Beware Crooks, Liars, Swindlers, Scoundrels,  Shysters!!!
