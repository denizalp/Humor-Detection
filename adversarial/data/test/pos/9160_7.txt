Hey Yall....Today i almost broke up with INDIAN FOOD, Let me start off by saying that this was the worst fucking  service of my life. I was given water no ice just a glass and water. I went to the buffet and lets just say the cupboard was bear. When I say it was barren of food, the moment that they brought one item out everybody rushed the buffet area. There was no rice, No masala chicken and a bunch of the s***. After my food was almost gone from  what I could savage up they brought me the famous garlic naan, which was naan existing. I asked for a sprite to wash down this mess and I was given a sour\/salty concoction asked for the waitress to bring me a lemonade if possible she said ok. Only to  return to clean up a 15 + party mess and never return to me. Oh I forgot to say that I had to go to the bar area in order to order my drink. As I went to go pay the manager came and gave me another sprite and said sorry for your inconvenience.  Now I'm sitting here pissed off and hungry better yet I am hangry. I also have to remember get my palette is a different beast food doesn't have to be heavily season it just has to have flavor,  flavors of its enthic culture. Next question of the day is will she ever go back? NOT IN A BILLION f****** YEARS!
