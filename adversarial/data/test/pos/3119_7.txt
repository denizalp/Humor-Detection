I seem to have a number of layovers here. When I have a layover I tend to want to do one of two things: wander around the airport [maybe there is a spa or an amazing restaurant] or hang out in a lounge.  Some airports have enough stuff going on it is easy to amuse oneself while stretching your legs between flights. This is not really one of them.\n\nWhile I find that the staff at the shops and restaurants here are generally pretty friendly this is a pretty nondescript, medium sized airport. It is relatively easy to find a place to charge your phone\/tablet\/laptop\/battery pack.  I wouldn't quite say it is forgettable but I will say it gets the job done.  This is the place where you want to get some reading  or phone calls done. It shouldn't be too tough to get some work done either.\n\nBut, what if you're traveling to the Grand Canyon? I suggest flying to Vegas and taking a helicopter to the Grand Canyon. Make it that much more exciting.
