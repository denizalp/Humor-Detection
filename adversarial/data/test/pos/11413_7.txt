Kudos to whoever it was that pushed for the new traffic lights at Scottsdale Quarter \/ Kierland. \nThese lights without doubt, have to be the coolest traffic lights ever, with an overhead display of a dozen large flashing red lights, and loudly audible pedestrian warnings sounding exactly like rapid machine-gun fire. Way cool.\nI don't know how our recently returned veterans  with PTSS are going to handle this, but I sure like it.\n\nI only wish Phoenix would adopt a similar light and sound show at their big pedestrian crossings, like the one at 24th St and Camelback where some blind guy Helen Keller'd his ass into the side of my truck while stopped at the light. \n\nWhat a rude prick. Yelling swear words at me like it was his job.\nHis job should have been sweeping that cane, hitting my door with it before stepping off the curb and collapsing into my truck. \nThat's where the machine gun sounds could have helped.\nAlthough he may have never heard it with my subs bumping, who knows.\n\nMaybe you should consider one more ordinance while you guys are on a roll.\nWhy not have a proficiency test for optically-challenged old dudes whose cane-sweeping skills are somewhat less than proficient.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, but thanks again!
