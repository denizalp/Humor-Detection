Try to cancel a membership here and you quickly find they have a multi-level song-and-dance about why they keep charging your card.  It is rehearsed nonsense about why 3 different layers of management need to get back to you before they can fix an obvious mistake, but none of those people are ever around, or can return your call, or have other contact info, or ... you get the idea.\n\nDo not trust them with your credit card info, and if you have made that mistake, just call your card and have them cancel any bogus charges.  They are familiar with these jokers and will save you the frustration of their runaround.
