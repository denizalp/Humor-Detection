This place is legit! I decided to go here one night because of all the positive reviews and I have to say I was impressed with the food and service.\n\nI ordered the green curry at the recommendation of the worker since it is one of their popular signature dishes. The curry was delicious with a creamy texture that was packed with flavor. Nothing is more annoying than a curry that is diluted with water. Loved the veggies that added a fresh crunch factor and the beef was tasty as well. The curry wasn't spicy either so don't worry too much about that if you cannot handle spicy foods.\n\nOverall I would recommend for you guys to check this place out if you haven't done so yet. I'd say it's on the same level as Penn's Thai House and way better than Gata. I'll be back here to try it more dishes and will update my review accordingly.
