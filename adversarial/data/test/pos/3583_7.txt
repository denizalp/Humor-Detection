Best pizza in Kent\/Stow. Love their meatballs and fresh mozz. Buffalo Chicken pizza is amazing, too \n\nLocal chain which I highly recommend.\n\nThey deliver to Kent and offer online ordering.\n\n___\n\nI see the Yelp automated software has excluded my review from the average rating, watching their little video its apparently because they don't think me qualified or don't frequent the place. For what its worth I have a degree from Johnson & Wales University and 7 years of professional kitchen experience, and this is my go to pizza spot and has been since 2012 - first the Twinsburg location, and now Stow. Take from that what you will. If I could review Yelp it would be a giant thumbs down.
