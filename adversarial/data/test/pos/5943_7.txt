I like Phoenix Sky Harbor, and as my local airport I'm happy with the many improvements that have taken place over the past several years to make travel easier.  \n\nThese improvements include the completion of the PHX Sky Train from East Economy Lot to Terminals 4 and 3, and a connection to the Phoenix Light Rail. \n\nAnother addition is the Cell Phone Parking Lot on the west side of the airport (includes free parking with very good signage regarding status of incoming flights).  \n\nTerminal 4 has been modernized to improve the look and feel of the retail space and to improve the restaurant offerings behind security.  Most of this work is complete.  \n\nTerminal 3 is currently under renovation to modernize the terminal, increase the number of gates, improve baggage handling capacity, and improve food concessions and retail offerings.  The estimated completion date for this project is 2020.  It is my understanding that Terminal 2 will be closed once the new and improved Terminal 3 opens.\n\nSky Harbor is a very good airport right now, and with the continued expansion and modernization that is taking place, it will only get better.  I'm definitely a fan.
