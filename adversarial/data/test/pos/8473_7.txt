Totally agree with Anthony M and i can see why Nelson Q is the duke of the place.\n\nMost AYCE places have restrictions on a few items and i get it you cant have a giant stock of sea urchin in the back and no way in hell is one guy going to eat 40 of them expensive prickly buggers. I get it. But restrictions on ice cream mochi?? You telling me i can eat as many rolls that contain soft shelled crab or all the yellow tail and fatty tuna nigiri i want but i'm limited to ONE sphere of ice cream covered in sweet rice paste??\n\nNOT Goyemon...Here you can pig out as much as you want. Had the spicy ass 911 roll and want to order an ice cream because 2 glasses of water, 3 packets of sugar, 3 bits of a spider roll, almost licking the plate the pork belly came from didnt work?? (true story) Well order some ice cream! It's dessert time and you've already ordered an ice cream? Well order some more ice cream! Damn that lychee sorbet hit the spot but you want another? Yeah you guessed it...order MOAR ice cream!!!\n\nAnd the big ass list to get me some of those 'useful' clicks from you guys\n\nCrispy Rice Cracker Spicy Tuna thingie\n - Oh man this was awesome, Crispy rice with spicy tuna on top with some sauce i think it was yum yum sauce drizzled on top oh lord this was good\n\nPork Belly\n - Being Vietnamese i've been eating pork belly most of my natural life...These grilled pork bellies are something else...Too much sauce on the pork belly? Still delicious. Not enough sauce on the pork belly? Still smokey grilled taste delicious\n\nDeep Fried Prawn Heads\n- If you like prawn heads then order a batch of deep fried prawn heads they are AMAZING. If you dont likek deep fried prawn heads order a batch for someone who does like prawn heads.\n\nYeah i'm gonna stop reviewing now...making me hungry.
