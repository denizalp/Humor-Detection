I don't care what any of you say, this place is the shizzle!  I've been to a LOT of sushi joints in the valley and none of them really have FANTASTIC sushi, merely different price points and presentation, neither of which make these places any more appealing to me.  \n\nFirst off, I tend to favor little hole in the wall joints rather than big fancy pants chains that are trying to be cooler than they really are.  Second, it's the best sushi you can get a a reasonable price.  Third,  if the service is good, that means I WILL be back.  Chance was our server this time, and was so witty and on the ball that it sealed the deal for our return.\n\nWe actually discovered Mido by mistake and couldn't have had a more fortunate accident!  My group ordered a number of the, um,  strangely named rolls, some of which were pretty damn delicious, others may not have suited my taste but were interesting nonetheless.  The first experience proved to be comical and appealing for reasons beyond the food;  the Ha Ha (HOT) roll being \"a little warm\" as an understatement, the sudden fear that the place may turn into a karaoke bar later in the night, and the look of pure raging hatred on the face of a hip Japanese teen when his birthday ice cream was brought to him with a candle and a song.   Fortunately no one ended up a burn victim,  nor is Mido a were-karaoke bar and the kid was not successful in his efforts to use his mind powers to induce cranial explosions in both his mother and father.\n\nSince then, we tend to go there at least once a week (or more) and make it a point to go there anytime someone is celebrating a birthday!  Keep in mind that I live in central Phoenix and drive all the way to Chandler to go munch at this joint.  Since Zen32 closed, there isn't anywhere closer that I enjoy nearly as much.\n\nCan't beat the price for all you can eat sushi, either.  Not even crappy sushi buffets can touch the $20 deal, which includes appetizers, dessert and a plate of sashimi that would run $40 anywhere else.\n\nThe three sushi chefs are unique on their own.  Pancho heads up the pack with a friendly attitude and good humor.  Definitely makes you feel welcome and can entertain you in a great deal of different languages.  \n\nOn a final note, If it's your birthday, be sure to opt in for the free ice cream and let them know it's your birthday!
