i think its safe to say that here at St-Viateur Bagels, they won my vote for best Montreal Bagels. They are not like my stomping grounds---NYC & NJ bagels, but theyre good. Slightly sweet but mostly salty. talk about seseme seeds---oh boy do they drown their bagels in them. Also, they have bagels of bagels ready to go home, butter and cream cheese to buy yourself and put on...a wall of photos to check out...and a very fun staff. however, despite these bagels being good...nothing is like my NYC\/NJ bagel, NOTHING COMPARES.
