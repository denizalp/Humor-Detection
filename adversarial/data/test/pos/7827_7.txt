This is my guilty pleasure.  After teaching a bootcamp class, I come here and indulge in those tiny perfect Black and Blue sliders, which I take with extra blue cheese and nothing more but the special sauce.  Great flavour and juicy patty inspite of its size.  The meat is iencased in a yielding sesame seed bun. which is fresh.  Also they have free wifi so you can blog about how badly you have sinned at this place, like I do when I also get the fries with chili and cheese or the onion rings on the side.  Sigh.  I think I am going to go right now and get all of them!
