went to buy a coffee pot for my wife last night,went thru the self check out.the \"cashier\" was at her station watching her screen while I was checking my items out,I would scan items and put items into bagging area.when done paid for item then put all item items into cart and cashier stopped me and said to me \"LET ME SEE RECEIPT,NEED TO CHECK FOR YOUR COFFEE POT YOU HAVE THERE MAKE SURE YOU PAY\"Look first off this thing is less than 17.00 and 2nd off it's not worth stealing.you need to learn how be a little more tactful and not accuse people of STEALING RIGHT OFF THE TOP YOU STUPID BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
