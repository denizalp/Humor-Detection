Cool Beans welcomed us when we first arrived in Medina.  \n\nIt is where I had a meeting with the wife of my husband's now employer, it's the place I took my laptop for free WiFi when we were without internet, and it's where I have had moments of calm and reflection and connection with new friends.  Plus, they have a drive-thru across the the street, which I find odd and appealing at the same time.\n\nTruth is, I cannot get over the fact that they serve coffee in styrofoam cups (hot AND cold drinks!)!  While I have read that styrofoam is actually more eco-friendly than paper cups, I really don't like how it feels in my mouth.  I'm a Seattle girl, and the only time drinking coffee out of styrofoam cups make sense to me is at AA meetings and Presbyterian church functions.\n\nBottom line: comfortable place to sit, decent tasting coffee, free WiFi, bring your own mug.
