I've been using Cleaning Authority for about a year or so. They do a great job and are very reliable. They charge me on the day they clean, are very good with my dog, and understanding when I forget they are coming and the place is a mess. I like that they use non-chemical cleaning products. When I get home I don't smell the \"clean house smell\" but I guess that's the trade off. Toni is awesome! But everyone does a great job. They have a systematic method with rotating focus areas so everything gets a deeper clean every so often.
