Hands down this is the best dayclub in Vegas. Plenty of space, places to sit\/shade areas for people who don't have tables, and always open bar for ladies! They even give away free bikinis which is definitely a plus! The pool is also heated a little so you don't feel like you're freezing in the water. The only thing I don't like is that they cut off guestlist times and start randomly charging for guys, so be sure to get there EARLY esp if there's a big DJ there. Also save yourself the cost of replacing your phone and buy a waterproof case on ebay for $2! \n\nP.S. If you're asian go to the asian male bartenders they're the nicest and pay equal attention!
