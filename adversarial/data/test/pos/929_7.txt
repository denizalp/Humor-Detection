This lady likes to humiliate her customers and misinform people. She also claims that it is illegal to take a photo for sharing information for consumers and customers. On my way to picking up my mother's prescriptions, I asked to use the restroom and she insisted that there wasn't one for customers. Then the pharmacy allowed me to use it and customer service opened the door for me. This lady gets paid for well customer service. She should find a different career.
