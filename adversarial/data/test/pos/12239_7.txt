I finally had the pleasure of stopping in Central Coffee today after seeing numerous tweets from them about their coffee of the day, business hours, etc. I had coffee in house, served in a mismatching saucer set-just my style.  I'm not a saucer kinda girl at all but it was lovely and so was the Central Shorty. I kept looking for images of Jesus or the Virgin Mary in my coffee but no go.However, I think I saw a heart  which was appropriate because I fell in love with CC today. This is going to be my new go to spot for coffee and free Wi Fi access when I'm in the Plaza area.\n\nNone of the patrons looked the same like they do at other coffee establishments and don't believe I saw anyone wearing a J Crew item-love. Plus no brats running wild, so yes CC, you have won my heart. I want to be a Central Shorty!!
