I go to Vegas a couple of times per year for a fashion trade show. Normally I stay at the Cosmo. I typically really enjoy it. It's clean and girly and there are chandeliers everywhere. This last time it was not great I'm sorry to say.\n\nProblems: \n-Even though we arrived at 8pm after driving from LA, our room wasn't ready. We had to wait 1.5 hours. How is my room not ready at 8pm? I had booked a 2 room suite 2 months in advance.\n-When we arrived to the room it was a handicapped room with low counters and low showers and no tub. I'm glad they have those rooms, but I'm 5'8\" and the shower head was below my shoulders and was broken.\n-The valet screwed up my car once, and it was taking so long to rectify the situation, that I took a taxi instead.\n-You can't order room service to the pool in the winter even though it's 80 degrees. There was no breakfast options anywhere except huge buffets. I was only offered the option to purchase chips and salsa at 10am at the pool. I should be able to order eggs wherever, whenever. \n-I asked housekeeping to bring me something and it never came.\n-We ordered coffee before work and it took over an hour to arrive.\n\nI guess the silver linings is that the rooms are clean and spacious. That's about it though. I think next time I'll take my company to the Wynn. \n\nA staff member informed me they were under different ownership. It's obvious customer service isn't a priority to these new owners.\n\nAdios, Cosmo.
