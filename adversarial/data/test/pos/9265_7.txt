It's sooooo loud!!!  The kiddos loved it!\n\nWhile my ears were ringing, we had a large salad from the salad bar and a medium combination pizza.  I added a small personal cheese and fried zucchini.  I would not call that a vegetable, but it was good.  My little cutie pie and nephew were dancing to the music while eating.  I told them that this would be the ONLY place they could do that.  \n\nI looked around and there were elderlies, young couples and small families enjoying the music entertainment.\n\nIt was a fun night!
