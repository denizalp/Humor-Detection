This place can't seem to decide if it's Tilted Kilt or TGI Friday's ....... \n\nBasically the food here is great, everything else is not.  a \"pasty\", apparently, is a shepherd's pie (or any other one of the 40 variations on a meat pie), which definitely is tasty.  Each pie I'd say is worth about $6 - $7, average price is 9.50, so a bit overpriced.  Scantily dressed, grumpy waitresses, references to beer and beer mugs everywhere, and extremely loud music that makes it hard to hear or be heard.  \n\nBasically, it's the perfect place to go if you're still in that teeny-bopper 20'ish stage, and mostly for an all-male crowd.  I wouldn't wander in here with kids, even though I did see one couple braving it with a 3 year old; they looked visibly uncomfortable.
