DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF SNACKS!!\n\nstumbled onto this place looking for the chick-fil-a (there's apparently not one in the mall any longer) and the couldn't resist the tasty looking pictures! So even though we were not craving Mexican, we were easily convinced... \n\n***DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURES!!!***\n\nEven though the cashier was very nice and friendly, almost everything went wrong with our order... My wifey and I wanted \"Tortas\" because the picture looked most appealing... She asked if they used guacamole or avocado and the cashier said they were actually out of both,  so she changed her mind to two tostadas (also looking very appealing) one chicken, one steak. I ordered the steak torta combo... simple order? right....? HOW COULD YOU MESS THAT UP???\n\nFORGOT: \n\n1. Beans on the tostadas... \n2. One chicken tostada, we got two beef\n3. My combo, I had to wait for my fries and soda to be prepared\n\nTASTE COMPLAINTS:\n\n1. Steak was rough, chewy, and unseasoned\n2. Fries were unseasoned, and salt and pepper was not available\n3. We tasked for a water cup, she accidentally put coke in it, pored the coke out and gave us water with out even rinsing the cup... ewwwww!\n\nI saw that other customers ordered snacks like fruit and chips that looked very appealing, but I will definitely not order a entree from here again!
