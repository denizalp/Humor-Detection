To the lady that rang all of my party in this Chinese fast food establishment, please learn some manners. Seriously? Just trying to get some Chinese food here. I don't recall ordering a side of attitude.\n\nOh, and the prices are jacked up by like $3-4. Yeah yeah, I know this is located on the Strip and all, but holy cow, is it even worth it?\n\nAccording to my drunchies, yes. Yes, it is.\n\nOtherwise, you should try going to a finer Chinese food spot in one of the casinos.
