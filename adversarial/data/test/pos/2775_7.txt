This is a review by a vegetarian\n\n\"Hurt so good. C'mon baby make it hurt so good\"\nThis lyric is oft whimpered in the darkest crevices of Vegas' eternal night life.\nHere, I proudly sing it with the speech impediment that comes with a painful case of pizza-mouth. Every little twinge from the gentle roof tissue burn reminds me of how it got this way.\n\nTo be clear, the small round pie I had was 4 star quality but I believe this pie will scale well to a large. There is no tip-sag at all (that's what she said!) on the small pie despite it having a little too much sauce and cheese. The big brother pie should be just about perfect.\n\nThe small square I took to eat later was one of the best silicians I've ever stuffed into my face. It's hefty crispy undercarriage ripping even more flesh from my maw. Do it to me baby.. (my safe word is pepperoni )
