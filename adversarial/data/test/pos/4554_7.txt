I was hungover as hell and came here one day.  Ordered more food than I have any business eating.  Poor kid made all my random orders as best he could.  Chili cheese fries were gross.  Pump chili is no bueno.  Gyro was ok but the sauce was non-existent.  Cheese sticks were gross.  Way too thick and not cooked enough.  Can ya tell I was wanting greasy food?  They also have 40s and Dippin Dots.  Plus the one dude is a beard brother from another mother...
