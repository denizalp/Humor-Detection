Two words: UNLIMITED BOOZE!\n\nHowever, the food here is whatever considering for a similar price I can go to bachannal or wicked spoon. The food here is pretty in the middle for me. My favorite thing are the king crab legs, prime rib and salmon. However, a lot of the food here were stale or utter failures. I am surprised I didn't break my teeth on the garlic bread here or macarons. Pretty much, some stuff were super cold and old and they just leave it there... they need to do a better job of switching stuff out.\n\nHowever, they have goose island ipa, a solid cab, chard and a solid dessert zinfadel. I hate to admit but the drinks here outrank the food. Compared to the above listed buffets, the desserts here were just miserable. Nothing tasted amazing. If not for my buy one get one free, I would never try this buffet.\n\nJust save yourselves the money and go to bachannal.
