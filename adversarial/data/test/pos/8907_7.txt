This is our new fried Seafood place in this part of town. It was the fried Oysters that got my attention. The prices here are reasonable and the food is fresh and tasty. They even have an all you can eat fried fish special that is worth checking out.\n\nInside is decorated with a fishing theme and there are several cool photos on the wall. Just go up and place your order and pick out a table. The condiment bar is really groovy and has one of those nifty fork dispensers. There is also a nice selection of hot sauces and even malt vinegar.\n\nStarted with a Oscar's Ultimate Combo with a side of Soft Shell Crab to get my feet wet. It is a deep fried Captain's dish with a little bit of everything. So good I brought my wife back for a Sunday throw down. She ordered the 2 pc Cod plate with fries and coleslaw. Yours truly went with some Cod, Oysters and Catfish. It was simply delightful.\n\nThey also have Salads, Sandwiches, Burritos, Tacos, and so on. Burgers and Chicken for you land lovers. Some of the items can also be broiled instead of deep fried. This is not a fancy Scottsdale restaurant. Just good food with a nice casual vibe. There was football playing on our last visit.\n\nExcellent service and a very clean restaurant. We both agreed we would be returning sooner than later. Can't wait to try out some of their homemade Clam Chowder and possibly an Oyster Po-boy or a Giant Catfish Sandwich. DEEP FRY ME BABY!\n\n4.75 STARS
