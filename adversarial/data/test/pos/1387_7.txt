I came here for breakfast one morning. It's located inside Bellagio hotel. We ordered 4 crepes. They're about $11 each. Breakfast crepe portion feeds 2 people. Dessert crepe is for 1 person portion although you can always share. Crepes are very good. They also have many different French pastries and pretty desserts. \n\nYou place your order with first person and pay with second person. They're high tech. It helps to move line faster. \n\nThis place does get crowded and sitting area can be limited which I don't care for. It's located close to Bellagio garden.
