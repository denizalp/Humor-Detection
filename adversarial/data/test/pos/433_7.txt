\"What's merguese?\" I asked my friend after she ordered the chicken merguese cous cous, at this Northern African resto located on Danforth near Coxwell. \n\n\"Sausage\" she replied. \n\n\"Sounds very much like the name of a South American dictator\" her husband contested. \"General Merguese is most displeased.\"\n\n\"No man it's sausage.\"\n\nAnd so we ate. From merguese, chicken and lamb to calamari and vegetable cous cous, our palates were satisfied and our stomachs filled with every bite of this Tunisian fare. \n\nHad a bite of someone's brique, a pastry stuffed with potatoes, parsley, egg and tuna. Tasted pretty bland to me. Wouldn't venture there again.\n\nGood food. Great friends. A place where you'd go with people who don't mind waiting the extra hour for food to arrive (service is quite slow) and who are interesting enough to chat with sans alcohol, since the place lacks a liquor license.  \n\nYou appreciate just how hard staff are working here and it certainly makes me want to patronize this restaurant more often.
