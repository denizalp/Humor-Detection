The food court is located in the second floor. That is also where you will find public restrooms. The restaurant offerings in the food court include AuBon Pain, Cheesesteak Charley's, Flamers, and Chinese food. If you want something a little sweet duck into the Hallmark store and grab some Sarris. There is also Katie's Kandy on the 1st floor. It has tons of different candy that you purchase by the pound. If you need a caffeine fix there is a great coffee shop located under the escalator. (Sounds weird, but trust me).
