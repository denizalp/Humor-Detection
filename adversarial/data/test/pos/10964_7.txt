I've been going to this place for years. \n\nIt's a Liquor Sto' and Mo'...\n\n\nIt's also a mini-mart. You can also cash a payroll check, fax and make copies. They have slot machines (I think almost each time I've gone in there has been at least one person playing) They sell cool sunglasses that are $20, and I swear they have the biggest cold beverage selection I've ever seen in a liquor store. \n\nThe guys behind the counter are always nice and they always chat with the regulars. That a major reason why I keep coming back.
