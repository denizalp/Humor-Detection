Quiet except for the constant construction daily for the past 6+ months, no parking. Guests have to walk from other end of complex. There is never open spots.\nPower hungry security that is rude. Harrasses myself and neighbor friends also. They chat amongst eachother and on the phones. They just pick up on girl residents instead of doing their job.\nFriendly staff that doesn't know how to adequately handle concerns. Quick maintenance but things are forever breaking which is annoying.. I'd give ZERO stars but I guess the location is what gives them any pull. There's a lot of roaches in the complex that gets into garages.\nCan't wait til my lease is up in December. Will not be staying here.
