After 17 months I can finally report that I had a wonderful experience at Nevada Oral & Facial Surgery with Dr. Brendan Johnson and his staff.  I had an implanted front tooth placed by another oral surgeon in California 12 years ago that became infected, was failing, and had to be removed.  Dr. Johnson not only performed this procedure skillfully, but over the course of over a year did two bone grafts (without charging for the second) and successfully placed another implant after the infection had been thoroughly cleaned and the surrounding gum tissue cleared up and supported by cadaver bone grafts.  He also provided a liaison from the company that supplied the new implant to assist my dentist in taking off a healing abutment and preparing an appropriate and nice-looking implant crown.  \n\nBecause a front tooth was involved, it was important that everything was done both technically and cosmetically right.  And it was!  I now have a new front tooth implanted in ample bone beneath a good gum line--thanks to the skill and fine care of Dr. Johnson and his supportive and knowledgeable staff.  And the total costs were much lower than initially predicted.\n\nIf I ever need any more oral surgery, I will not hesitate to return here for further care, and certainly recommend him to others.  There is a reason why I had to wait almost two months to secure an initial appointment with Dr. Johnson.  His professional reputation is well known to those in search of an excellent oral surgeon.
