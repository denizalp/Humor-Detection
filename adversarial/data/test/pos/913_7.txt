UPSALE! As soon as they walked they started talking to my wife about $600 to clean the tile. My wife called me and I told her no. They immediately dropped it to $500.  I still said no. They told her it would still be an extra $65 for some reason and she paid it. \n\nIt looked like all they did was get my carpet wet with water. NOT A SINGLE SPOT WAS REMOVED throughout the entire house. \n\nTHEY SUCK!
