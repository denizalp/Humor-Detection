This is not your average Joe. The food here is pretty spectacular. \n\nCame here for the famous stone crabs and enjoyed them. I hear that stone crabs are a Florida thing so I bet they are better fresh there but these were pretty darn good. They give you a plate full of just the claws BINGO or should I say KENO since it's Vegas.  It's my favorite part of the crab and the meat has a nice sweetness to it.  To top it all off the crabs come already cracked for you. No more man vs. crab, a battle I've lost many times. You practically just slide the shell right off.   I left with no chipped teeth and without any scratches yea-ah. \n\nAlso had a nice ahi salad and the crab bisque. Both were delicious.  A nice light lunch except for the Bloody Mary. \n\nThe Bloody Mary here was the best I've ever had and I don't normally like bloody mary. It was like a meal in itself. Came with a large stalk of celery and these excellent tomato olives.  Asked for it spicy so it had a nice kick to it. Very flavorful and went well with the crab. No cocktail sauce needed after drinking that cocktail.\n\nAll in all a good place. It's not a hole in the wall type of place but it does burn a hole in your pocket. It's a bit on the pricy side but that's to be expected. I mean hey I don't see crab growing anywhere near Vegas. It's expensive to ship them in and I'll gladly pay anyone to crack my crabs for me.
