If I can put zero stars I would. We had a party of 15. All stand up guys and gals of society mind you. I myself was ready to go. Unfortunately, they held my card hostage until everyone else paid. I paid my part of the bill but the manager lets call him Jorge told me there's a balance left on the bill that he wouldn't pay. He spoke to me like I was bouncing out on the bill even though I paid my part. I told him the rest of the people I was with would pay their share. Seriously, nobody had any intentions of dining and dashing out but he looked at me like I just came out of San Quentin. I told him so your basically holding me hostage. Jorge still wouldn't budge. The waitress was nice. Nothing against her. The way they do things there I guess are exactly the same way they do things in Tijuana. Anyhow, I'm never coming back to this ghetto ass chuntarito place ever again. Eff yoo see kay senor frogs. Your business model is crap and I hope you close down soon. It's a shame treasure island let you rent space from them. I personally think you bring their property value down. You all are rude and well, I pray you close. Oh that's right, I already said that. Also, your manager and your punk ass security guards should shoot for higher goals. Get your GED's for gods sake.
