We managed to work our way through several hotels in order to get to our \"final destination\" where I was going to use my \"free\" $200 worth of slot credits at Casino Royale. Since we were walking through and saw $5.00 Let It Ride tables and $5.00 Black Jack tables, we decided to spend a bit of time here. \n\nThe tables and the dealers were worn out and not in a good way. I pretty much felt like this was a notch down from the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street and barely a step above The Plaza. Oh well, at least this place provided me with another place to Yelp!
