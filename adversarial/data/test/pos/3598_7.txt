Felt compelled to review these gals because Property Management Companies always get terrible reviews and I've had a good experience so far.\n\nI just moved into an apartment thanks to Janine who has been a pleasure to work with. Transparent and flexible throughout the process. Janine and her office have been nothing but excellent to me. (I promise I'm not affiliated with them- this is a tenant review) of course, this review will be edited if their treatment towards me changes (yes, I'm also wary based on previous reviews). \n\nBut, so far 5\/5 stars :)
