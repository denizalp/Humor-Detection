it's taken me over a month to write this review because I was so pissed off after leaving this store. I must have had a target on my head when I walked into this place, the salesman ( I think his name is Rick or asshole) who ever it was apparently made up his mind as soon as I walked in the store that he wasn't going to let me leave until I spent triple my budget. Long story short F**K this place, unless you like to spend 3X the money it would take to get the same items at a different store. Which is exactly what I did.
