Should be a 4 star at least (especially to Jeremy the GM and Anthony the associate in the Diesel & Boss area).  The only reason why I can't give it was because of a service note that doesn't represent the Harry Rosen brand at all.\n\nThis is my first visit after a poor visit in January and I can say this was a remarkable turn around in service.  I'll start with the positives.  Jeremy took ownership of the service misstep even though he wasn't the one responsible for it...  that's great leadership for his staff to learn and grow from.  He heard my concern and wished I would return one day in hopes I can see an improvement.  Fast forward 3 months later, I returned and things are wonderfully different.\n\nThe store is still gleaming with incredibly well done displays to showcase their high end men's wear.  Everything is impeccably clean and it's spotless.  Nothing is a mess... not even a single sock is out of place.  \n\nThe staffing is different as well and they're focused on providing exceptional service.  This particular Saturday I could easily see many staff helping someone and also on the look out to help someone.  I was asked by at least 3 people while walking around if I needed help... the great thing, it felt authentic and genuine. There was only 1 group of associates who less interested in helping (more on this later).  Everyone else was looking at everyone coming in and welcoming them.  They all asked if I needed help finding a size or looking for a gift.  Certainly a step up from my other experiences even at Nordstrom or Holt Renfrew.\n\nI do have to commend Anthony.  After a few moments stepping into his area, he quickly said hello with a smile and wanted to see how he can help me.  I did ask him if he had 2 items that I've seen online and he quickly went to go find it. He realized quickly that (unfortunately) the size was not available but there would be no issue to bring in the size needed.  The other item was set in another part of the store but did that stop him from helping?... Not at all.  He seamless transitioned to another area to help find that particular item in a different brand. With his good insight on how certain pieces feel or fit, we learned more about brands we would have never considered.  If you're looking to buy jeans or very well made casual pieces from great brands, I honestly suggest coming to this store and ask for Anthony.  He honestly tries in every way to find exactly what you're looking for.\n\nSo why the drop in star... well, I hate writing this as I feel this doesn't represent the Harry Rosen brand at all.  When I first walked in, I immediately didn't feel comfortable.  If anything, I was worried my January experience would be repeated.  Two young female associates (A light long hair blonde and an Asian ombre haired) were doing the mean girl act.  You know how it goes... size up another girl, talk about her while looking at her with disdain, and then size her up again.  Yeah... that.  It's not high school anymore.  If this whole incident didn't exist... I'd feel comfortable saying that Harry Rosen Yorkdale exceeded my expectations on what a luxury shopping experience should be.  \n\nWell, maybe 3 times a charm?  Father's day is coming up!  Maybe I'll get a chance to see if things has improved once again.  But honestly... it's a great spot to see the latest in high luxury fashion.  Just ask for Anthony or any of the other gentleman who's genuinely ready to help.
