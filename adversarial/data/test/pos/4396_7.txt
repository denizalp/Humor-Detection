This place is a joke. We went there ready to use our Entertainment Book 2-1 coupon, but it was not to be. They have a sign on the front window babbling about some misprint in the book and that they do not accept the coupon.\n\nTranslation - this is a cheap family who won't honor the coupon. If your in the book, take the coupon you filthy cheap owners. I did not buy the book to have you not take what's in the book. Do not patronize these liars.
