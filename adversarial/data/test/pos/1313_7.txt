Quit complaining that it's a cheap restaurant, judge it for what it is. Sundays are my favourite with 69 cent tacos. The trick is to order the guacamole entree and tortillas with your tacos, spread some guac on the tortilla and wrap it around the taco. VOILA - deliciousness.\n\nFood:  7\/10\nService:  7\/10\nPrice:  8\/10\nAtmosphere:  8\/10
