This place is GHETTO like any other station. I'm not  complaining as long as it gets me from Point A to Point B.\n\nFares are cheap but my only complaint is that the WiFi on the buses rarely or ever work. \n\nThis station is memorable in that I witnessed 2 women arguing loudly for the whole place to watch them and racial insults were hurled left and right - that was HILARIOUS!! (and unnecessary) \n\nThe Black lady called the Hispanic woman a \"Tacohead\" continuously and she called the Transgender security guard \"lost\" and asked her if she was \"sure of herself\".\n\nI was dying.
