My husband and I came on opening night. I never ever would normally go on the very first day a restaurant opens, but I couldn't wait. I wasn't disappointed. I dig Gorilla Whale's unique spin on their food. \n\nI tried the Gorilla Whale + Village Brewery ginger beer. Refreshing and light, it reminded me of kombucha. I would order this again. Local draft beers were only about $5-6 a pint. No need for happy hour at these prices.\n\nWe tried the milk bread with bone marrow butter. The bread was very light and flaky, it went well with the generous amount of butter. I'd order this again too. \n\nThe skewers were awesome. We ordered the chicken thigh with skin on and the halloumi cheese. The chicken was juicy and the char on the skin was so good. The cheese was another winner. The texture of the exterior reminded me of a marshmallow cooked over a fire. The egg dip was delicious and went well with both skewers. I would come back for the skewers and I want to try the shrimp and pork belly skewers next.\n\nWe shared the chicken karrage burger. John M, if you are reading this, you need to try it. That karrage was cooked so well! The skin was brittle and crunchy. The bun and toppings were not Japanese'ish. The cheddar cheese, thick crisp piece of bacon  and coleslaw went well with karrage. The simple salad was fresh and full of micro greens. \n\nEveryone in the restaurant was ordering ramen and they looked like they really enjoyed it. I ordered the duck confit ramen. My broth was salty, but I think it was just my bowl because I saw everyone else drinking all the broth from their bowls. I loved the sprouted peanuts as the taste reminded me of peas. \n\nService was great. My husband spilled his beer and the liquid went flying to the next table. We were so embarrassed. I wanted to pretend it didn't happen but I couldn't, especially with one table by the window laughing about it. However, the owner and the poor woman next to us were very kind. The owner even replaced his beer.  \n\nSo what's the damage for this lovely feast? For two beers, two entrees, two skewers, and one appetizer, the bill ONLY came up to $65. That is a steal. I'm already planning our next visit.
