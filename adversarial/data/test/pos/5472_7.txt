I have NO idea why people are raving about this. I was a fan of them on the ABDC, but as a Vegas show they completely FAIL. The only good thing about the show was the music and when they did the first few moves from \"Single Ladies\" - that cracked me up. \n\nOtherwise...  the attempted \"plot\" was lame and made no sense (what's with the dead janitor please?) The dancers were out of sync. The costumes were boring. And the masks completely detracted from any personal connection to any dancer. \n\nSo my rec is: if you score free tickets, watch it, but don't pay for it!
