Disclaimer: I have watched Chuck Hughes and wanted to try one of his restaurants. I take celebrity chef restaurants with a grain of salt and I go in with low expectations. \n\nBefore I went I checked online if any reservations were available. No reservations were available so I took a risk and headed down.  To make sure I would have a chance to get in, I went right when they opened at 5:30. Much to my surprise, during the approximately two hours I was there, the restaurant wasn't full. What is up with there being no reservations available?  \n\nWhen I eat at \"fine\" dining establishments I like to order a little at a time. I don't have my entire meal planned out as I don't know how filling each course will be. Maybe after the first course I'll find the food isn't good and I will want to leave.  I started doing that and the person who served me said, \"You will get better service if you order all of your food at once.\"  \n\nWhat?\n\nI've never heard that in my life. It smacked of get 'em in and get 'em out. I left after the first course. \n\nI did, however, try the house-made smoked salmon. That was delicious.
