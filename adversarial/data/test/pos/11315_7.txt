I took my car in for a same day service. Justin ordered the wrong part so it turned into my not getting my car back until Tuesday. When I got my car back my air still didn't work. I ended up taking my car to Justin 5 times, renting two rental cars, my spouse taking off work resulting in lost wages, and paying for daycare service for days I didn't use because I was going back and forth dealing with this. Justin rescheduled,  never apologized or offered compensation. Instead he said, 'I didn't ask you to come to me.' Here's what I believe to be true about Justin and his ethics. He never changed out my compressor. I know this because my air exhibited the same characteristics after it was 'fixed' as it did before. He said it was a faulty unit but I don't believe this. I believe Justin tried to swindle me and thanks be to God it didn't work out for him. I also know he is dishonest because I asked him to fix a broken seat belt in my car. I called the dealership and priced it direct with them. Justin quoted me a rate two times the amount the dealership was going to charge me. And what's funny (not funny) about that is he said the repair was going to be so costly because of the part coming from the dealership. Somehow the part inflated 200 dollars from BMW to Justin... this review is about Justin's absence of ethics. Which is funny because he was recommended to me. His absence of empathy or respect for others time and money. I would NEVER go to him again and I'm posting online NOT because this is something I do BUT because I'm warning you. The savings aren't worth it if the person is willing to cheat you, leave old parts in and fix around them, you have to take off work so he can fix his faulty work, fill up tanks of gas because you have to drive back multiple times, rent cars,  etc... just go to the dealership at least they stand behind their work.
