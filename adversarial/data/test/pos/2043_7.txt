Bosa kicks ass! Every donut i tried( a lady never reveals her number) was delicious! Awesome variety as well. and super duper cheap wallet friendly prices! They also have a nice assortment of drinks also..they even have boba drinks.... donuts and boba drinks available 24 hrs a day?! not sure it i will ever crave these two things together but now i know if the feeling ever comes over me..i can get it at at the drive thru at 3:13am in my bath robe.\n\nhow is this not good news?!
