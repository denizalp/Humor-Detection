I attempted to use my living social voucher this afternoon at Kimberly Ann's Tea Room. Had the pleasure of dealing directly with the manager\/owner, Kimberly. Unfortunately, she would not honor my voucher stating that it required 24 hour advance reservation. I asked her to show me where in the fine print this stipulation was listed and when she was unable to find it she stated that it was Living Social's fault for not including it. Really? Aren't you in charge of final ad copy as the merchant?? I requested that she apply my voucher to purchase price of anything else on the menu and she refused. I didn't think that was too much to ask. Now she will have to deal with the negative feedback about her establishment\/management practices on the internet. Definitely NOT a smart management decision on her part. \n\nBelow is an exact copy of fine print on my voucher:\n\nthe fine print\n\nLimit 2 per customer, 2 additional as gifts\nLimit 1 per table per visit\nValid Monday through Thursday\nExcludes holidays including Valentine's Day, Easter, and Mothers Day weekend\nEntire value must be used in a single visit
