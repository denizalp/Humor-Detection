Leave your coronas, heinekens, and vodka\/cranberries at the door- Harvard and Highland is here to entertain your tastebuds. Harvard and Highland is a bright star in my East Liberty world and is a great bar with wonderful craft cocktails that will match your mood. The menu is diverse and each carry unique tastes. They also get plus points for their creative cocktail names (my fave is S.S. Awesomepants!)\n\nI love the space, though it can get pretty loud when the bar's bustling with action (I suspect it's because there are few textile pieces to absorb the sound). The bartenders are attentive and while they have a demanding job description, they have an uncanny talent with keeping tabs on who doesn't need a drink, who is new, and who needs a little patter to decide on a drink.\n\nWhen I walked in for the first time, I had no idea what I wanted to ask for, since the cocktails are deconstructed with ingredients and leave a lot of imagination as to what the final result may look like. Don't be afraid to have a conversation with your bartender to decide on your next drink! I trusted my bartender and let her know what kind of drinks I liked (I usually drink blah blah blah and I'm in the mood for something refreshing\/spicy\/with a kick please!) She was able to make recommendations based on that  and gave me the High Line (I think that's what it was..but it was on the chalkboard) which I must say was pretty refreshing.\n\nI can't wait to come back and taste what else Harvard and Highland has in store for us!
