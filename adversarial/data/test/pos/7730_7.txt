Hrm, I was torn between giving Buffalo Exchange 1 star or 2 stars, but I decided on 1. \nI've only been here twice and after my second experience today, I remembered why I had not been back since the first time a couple years ago: it's quite awful. I did a little spring cleaning recently and I donated my first bulk of stuff to Savers then after my second round of spring cleaning I realized, \"hey, I can probably take a lot of this stuff to Buffalo Exchange and get a little out of my hardly worn, cute stuff.\" Well, \"a little\" is an overstatement as I hardly got anything at all. I would describe Buffalo Exchange's Buyers as \"Greedy Hipsters\" with a sense of entitlement and questionable taste. (I know this probably sounds rude, but I truly feel that way, it would probably help if they at least had less snooty attitudes) Mind you, I made sure to take good stuff in and I had 3 large bags full of stuff and all that the buyer ended up buying were a cute pair of sandals and a pair of real cowgirl boots. And do you know how much I got out of it? Nine dollars. Yep. Pretty much my trip's worth of gas. But the items were priced for resale at $15 and $30something. Ugh, talk about a waste of time. My options were $9 in cash or $13 in store credit so I decided to look around to see if maybe something caught my eye and the only thing that caught my eye was the fact that they had some really ugly stuff and I became bewildered at how my stuff got turned down, yet they bought some of this stuff. I checked the price tags on some of the \"ugly stuff\" I saw and became even MORE bewildered: A USED, \"nothing special\", not a big brand top, for $24!! No thanks, I'll just go to Target or Forever 21 or H&M and get something better, and NEW for that same price. \nAnnoyed at my waste of time, I took my $9 cash and headed to the nearby Savers to donate the rest of my stuff. Needless to say, this made me feel a lot better, they were much nicer and I knew my donations would help a good cause. \nThe only positive things I have to say about B.E. is probably that they do have a good selection of shoes and sunglasses but the shoes are of no use to me as I have small feet and can never find anything in my size anyway. \nI like the concept of buying\/selling\/trading and Buffalo Exchange sounds like a cool place, but alas, it just isn't. :(
