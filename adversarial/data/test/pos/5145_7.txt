It's hard to argue with $2 you-call-its!\n\nPopped in here last night for a cinco-de-mayo drink. We spotted a few client√®le sporting oversize mustaches and sombreros. While most of Cleveland ignores our sacred southwest holiday, I was happy to celebrate the Suns beating the Spurs with a Corona here :)
