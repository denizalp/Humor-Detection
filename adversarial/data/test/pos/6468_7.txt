Very disappointed with this place.... I came now 8 times to get a piercing changed out and the lady is never there. I don't care if your moving you still have a job and it takes two seconds to call someone back!!!! I give them my number twice now and no phone call. I wanted to get a price for a tattoo as well but if they suck this bad on getting back to people on just a piercing they are not worth my time. The guy up front every time I'm in has no idea what's going on and is always on his phone! The picture they have on line look awesome but they have NO customer service. I've never been to a tattoo place this bad..... I guess they don't need customers since they don't contact people back. Don't wast your time like I said they will not call you back oh and they will not wast there time on little tattoos. My friend and I stoped in to get a little one and they tuned us away.
