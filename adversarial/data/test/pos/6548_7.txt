I can't believe all the bad reviews here. I have been coming to Divine about once a month for several years. I have a favorite masseuse so maybe I'm biased but I've never had a problem. Everyone seems to have a problem with the subscription service but it's never been pushed on me, and $49 for a facial or massage is a great deal. Oh well, guess you can't make everyone happy...
