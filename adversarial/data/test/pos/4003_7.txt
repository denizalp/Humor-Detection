10 shirts cleaned, pressed and lightky starched for $21.  Man it's an affordable time saver.  I've been here many times and satisfied with the results and turn around time, every time.  I've also had a very expensive comforter (always risky) cleaned here and it turned out great.  Nothing fancy here... just solid service at a fair price.  Ladies at the desk are good people in my experience.
