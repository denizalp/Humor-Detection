Pretty fun!  Didnt know how my lil one (or myself for that matter) would dig the slide but we did!  Just bought a one time pass but next time we will buy the unlimited for a few clams more.  Nice fireplace inside and the slide is lit well.  Hard to get pics of people coming down though, which sucks.  Do not take PCP before riding this thing though...this is bat country and they will attack you...
