Its hard to find good BBQ in Pittsburgh. It's even harder to find it in Jabo's Smoque House. I went with my family in summer of 2017. The bartender and wait staff were fine, but the food was just not worth the money.\nWe shared the Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs, and 1\/2 Chicken. Of those 4 dishes I'd say only the chicken was tastier than something you could for lunch get at Donatelli's for $2.50. Nothing was worth the price, especially considering what $12 will get you at Tessaro's, Lot 17, Thai Cuisine or Gourmet, BBT, Caliente, or even Nico's.\nThe side dishes were very disappointing. When I saw my Mom putting salt on the mac and cheese I thought she was having a senior moment. When I tried some of it, I longed for a pot of hot water and the $2.75 it would cost to buy a box of Velveeta shells and cheese from ShurSave, though considering their prices it's probably $6.50 by now.\nThis place is not worth my time or money. Maybe someone with more of both will try it in a few months and it will have improved by then. Dopey name aside, it would be nice to have a decent BBQ place besides Tessaro's on Tuesday or whatever.
