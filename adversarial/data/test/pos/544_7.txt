So I'll admit, I actually thought Miu's in Tempe INVENTED this style of cuisine. I had never had it or even seen it anywhere besides there (probably because of that whole \"secret menu\" thing chinese restaurants like to do). So when I moved from the Tempe area a few months ago, not being a stones throw from Miu's was, quite honestly, the saddest part.\n\nWhen I found out the Szechwan Palace (Located about three blocks from where I used to live in Arcadia, BTW) also offered the spicy cucumbers, dan dan noodles, and spicy lamb ribs I had come to love, I was so excited to try it and PRAYED it would fill the void in my life that Miu's once filled.  Well, it didn't.\n\nThat's not to say it's not like 1000x better than any other \"Americanized\" Chinese restaurant out there (Also, it's hilarious that they have a an actual section of the menu called \"Americanized Chinese\"), but when comparing Apple to Apples (which I always do when it comes to restaurants like this) Miu's is a 5 and Szechwan is about a 3. Here's my deal (and i ordered my exact order):\n\n1) Spicy cucumbers were warm  One of the most delightful aspects of this dish is the cool temperature combined with the heat.  Warm cucumber are gross.\n\n2) Dan Dan noodles were standard. Much cheaper than Miu's though so that got them a star\n\n3) Spicy Lamb Ribs were a little weak. I get that I'm a white girl drinking pinot grigio, but a can handle my heat.  Please don't coddle me. \n\nBasically, if you need szechwan in the area, which I do, I'm glad they are here.  But if you are looking for top notch food, go to miu's.  If you're looking for top notch service, don't get chinese, because it sucks everywhere.
