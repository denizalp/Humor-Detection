I called after years of hearing their radio ads and the salesman told me to fill out the finance app and come in the next day. He told me to take a look at the inventory so I would have an idea of what I wanted when I came in. I arrived bright and early the next day along with 20 other people when I met the salesman and he told me to go out and walk around the lot and pick out my car. Nothing that was on the website was in inventory and what they did have was all trash. Half the cars were not even clean on the inside (they don't have a detailer ?) and there was still soap scum on several from their wash with no rinse. Hurried and got out of there before the salesman even came outside. I'd try every dealership in the Pittsburgh area before swallowing my pride and getting stuffed into an overpriced vehicle here.
