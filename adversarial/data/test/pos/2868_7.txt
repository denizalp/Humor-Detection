I love that this restaurant takes priority pass. It is such a great way to start off any vacation. \nI always get either the fat head bumble berry beer (my favorite summer beer) or the Great Lakes dortmunder gold. \nAs far as food goes, you can't go wrong with the spicy wings or the fish and chips (I was also skeptical of getting fish in an airport but theirs is so fresh!)
