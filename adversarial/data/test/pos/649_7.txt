Hey may have been the worst doctor I have had, unfortunately. The only reason I gave him two stars is because he is very intelligent. I feel as though he is one of those doctors that got straight A's through schooling but never learned bedside manner. He is very short with me as a patient and I feel talked down to. I've waited over an hour and a half to speak with him for less than ten minutes of his time. \n\nVery much lacking thoroughness and follow-up. I was even prescribed a medication that I was told NOT to take by the pharmacist because of other issues (that I know I told several staff about). After three days or so (because I could only leave a message), his partner's medical assistant called me back saying the pharmacist was right and to NOT take the medication.
