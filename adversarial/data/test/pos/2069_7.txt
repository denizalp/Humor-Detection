Ok, so this is the \"liberal\" paper of Pittsburgh, eh? \n\nWell you do have Tony Norman, who's a progressive and a comics fan, which is pretty cool by me even though he's also a bit of an Obamabot. Vote 3rd party and get back to me, ok Tony?\n\nThen there's Rob Rogers, one of the most incisive political cartoonists on the scene. \n\nMaureen Dowd is a mildly liberal bore.\n\nReg Henry is milquetoast.\n\nRuth Ann Daily is the daughter of Phyllis Schafly, Ann Coulter-lite, or an aspiring Stepford Wife. I can't figure her out.\n\nGeorge Will. Ugh. \n\nScott Mervis doesn't get the metal, but at least he's not Ed Masley who should be strapped to a pentagram and set ablaze for his clueless (fear-ridden?) derision of the music. Allison Romero has written a few good metal articles though, so maybe someone read my emails. \n\nOh, Mervis' top guitarists list? A joke. \n\nRob Owen's TV column is pretty good even though I don't always share his tastes. He reminds me somewhat of Robert Bianco who has long since moved on to USA Today. I used to love when he'd skewer popular shows I despised. \n\n\"Seen\" makes me want to smash an ice sculpture up with a hammer and put it chunks of it through the windows of mansions. Do we need to have sheer privilege rubbed in our noses? Who really needs to know about what fun old moneybags are having when The Great Depression has never ended? \n\nThe local news articles are pretty good though. Sadie Gurman busts her ass! I met her once at a picnic. I got her card. Nice girl. Never called her though. \n\nThe Post-Gazette's a decent paper, but then again I'm a socialist, so I'm hard to please when it comes to the news media.
