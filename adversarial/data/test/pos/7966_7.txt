Sleepy Hollow is a mean, vindictive golf course. It was designed by somebody in the 1920s who understood what bad golf was and made a course that punishes every bad shot. No mercy. And the place is always crowded so plenty of people will see you screw up.\n\nIt is a beautiful course and the people running it have their act together. The course is always in good shape.\n\nIt is owned by the MetroParks and their rates are low compared to the quality of the course.\n\nThese three considerations mean that it is always crowded (because it's beautiful and cheap) and it is always slow (because it is crowded and takes eight strokes to reach the green on a par five) so a round of golf will take you awhile.\n\nThere's a green on this golf course that is so severe that a person like me can easily have four or five putts and the second putt is longer than the first and the third is from the fringe. You hit the putt, it stops and then rolls back toward you, picking up speed, so you have to get out of its way. Your buddy is laughing at you. Until he does the same. I won't tell you which hole. You'll know it when you see it.
