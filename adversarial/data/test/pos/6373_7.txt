Two Words: Stay Away!\n\nI feel the need to write this review as it will serve as the only proof (other than pictures) that I was physically injured by the owner of this business. Following my first visit (2015) which had Kim (CEO\/owner) treating my belly with the heaviest hand ever, I experienced a level of injury that covered my ENTIRE stomach. The severe tissue damage, coupled with deep organ pain, appeared within an hour of her treatment. I called immediately and her assistant informed me that if I had a little bruising which \"is not uncommon,\" I could apply some Arnica and ice and that all should be well after a little time. I never heard from Kim (CEO\/owner).\n\nI didn't think her assistant realized the extent of the damage and after I texted a pic of my battered stomach to them, Kim (CEO\/owner) called me immediately to ask, \"Who did that to you? Who was your technician?\" The phone went silent when I told her that it was her. \n\nThe equipment is VERY HEAVY and she used an s*t-ton of force, pushing and running the device so hard into by belly that I was shaking and sweating on the table in SEVERE pain. She was literally banging the device into my pelvic bones as she ran it over my belly. I could not believe the pain and asked if it was normal while on the table (knowing I would not be able to tolerate a second treatment). I recall her muttering something about some people being more sensitive than others and that a little discomfort was to be expected.\n\nI don't exactly know how cavitation works but my concern, even though the injuries gradually faded after about 8 days with salves and Arnica and Ibuprofen for the soreness, is with the level of radio frequency she may have used. Coupled with the magnitude of force she used, I am wondering if she may have damaged the DNA in my cells, which down the road may result in cancer.\n \nI called a lawyer the next day and they notified me that unless I need medical attention, they were limited on what they could do. But they DID advise me to document the occurence for my records.\n\nTo make matters worse, Kim (CEO\/owner) NEVER apologized. She has an air of superiority about her that likely comes from being a Scottsdale business owner. Zero sympathy, no money back offered, no call to check back, no apology, NOTHING.\n\nLadies & gents, you've been warned. Buyer beware! \n\nI would stay as far away from this business as possible.
