Oh, Ale Asylum, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:\n\n1. The beer here is fantastic.  And high in alcohol content.  Bonus.  You can try nice sized samples for a couple of bucks.  Perfect for taste sharing.  Or not.\n2. The food is great too.  It's a small menu, but it's a quality one.  I mean, you're in Wisconsin so you know there's at the very least good sausage and cheese on there.\n3. The brewpub is just cool looking.  Even their menus make me feel cool.\n4. They've got an awesome outdoor patio.  There's nothing to look at, really, but it's big and open and has good service.  \n5. Pretty much everything Ale Asylum sells has something metal on it.  Rock on.\n6. You can get glasses, apparel, and beer to go at the bar.  Boom.
