I had lunch at Papi Chulo's yesterday and I must say I was impressed. I had the enchiladas with the green sauce and the sauce was delicious! I also liked the chips (warm) and salsas they gave us. I eat mostly mexican food and they have earned my business. The service was very good. We had a waiter and a gentleman, possibly the manager that was checking to make sure we were satisfied. It was during the lunch hour, and while they were busy, they managed to make sure we were satisfied with our experience. They gave us lunch club cards with 5 punches already in each one. So onyl two more lunches and we get a freebie. I may become a regular here... they also have a private room for networking and private lunches.
