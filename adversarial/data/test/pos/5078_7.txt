SPOILER ALERT: The music and TV ruined everything! More details at end of review.\n\nMy husband and I were craving sushi but didn't want to spend much, so we thought this place looked promising. It looks like it has the potential to be really cool. The open-air restaurant with wood pallet-covered walls gave a unique atmosphere. The restaurant is in a prime location, next to lots of great places on Roosevelt -- so we expected it to be on par with these places that we love.\n\nSadly though, we did not enjoy our experience. The sushi was fine -- nothing remarkable, but did the job for the price we paid. The complimentary miso soup was better than some others I've had. We somehow awkwardly ended up with two waitresses, who both didn't seem to know that the other was already taking care of us. One would drop by moments after the other just had. Our first waitress seemed annoyed by us when we told her the second one had just taken our order. We honestly didn't know who was supposed to be helping us!\n\nThe real downfall though, was the combination of 2-3 different music sources playing different (bad) music at the same time, along with 2 TVs playing different shows with the volume up (neither of which I wanted to watch). The restaurant is pretty small and we were the only ones sitting inside... so we could hear ALL these different media sources at the same time. It was really annoying. At one point, Shaggy (the annoying hip hop guy from the 90s) was playing from one stereo, Backstreet Boys was playing from another, and Bad Grandpa (the Jackass movie) was playing on the TV right above us. PLEASE, do NOT show Bad Grandpa while I'm eating dinner. And limit your music to just one song playing at a time (preferably better music than Destiny's Child and Creed... both of which we also heard).\n\nHonestly, this music thing ruined any otherwise positive experience we might have had dining. We were both a bit hungry after our sushi, and probably would've ordered another roll or two at that point. But by the end of our meal, we were so annoyed by the music & Bad Grandpa that we wanted to get out of the restaurant as soon as we could.\n\nAgain, this restaurant really does have potential to be something great and successful. But the first thing that needs to be fixed is atmosphere - simply by correcting the awful music situation that literally drove us away.
