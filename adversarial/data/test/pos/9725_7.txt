Stopped by this spot to kill some time before a show in Vegas.  Well off the Las Vegas strip, the store seem like it was newly built.\n\nI don't ride a Harley but my dad does, so we went and checked it out anyways.\n\nVery large store but nothing notable as far as parts or selection to mention.  Seems like Harley stores franchised or not all carry pretty much the same product for the same price.  The folks are friendly and willing to talk bikes all day.  The best part of about this store are the collection of vintage bikes that are (some) for sale and others for display.  I've seen a Moto Guzzi and Bimoto, as well as very classic crotch rockets from Ducati, Suzuki and Honda.  All of which I wouldn't have expected to see in a Harley store of all places!  But definitely cool to look at.
