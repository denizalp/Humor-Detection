This is a new location for Bubba's.  Was advised it was still a soft opening.  This use to be another restaurant and bar connected to the ice area at Southpointe.  \nThe place is large and just a few people having lunch.  Probably a good spot to watch your kids and friends playing hockey and have a cold one. The wait staff was very friendly, helpful and on top of refills.  Could see one of the waitress' being trained on the computer ordering system.  \nThe menu has Fresh Salads, Starters and Fresh Burgers that are a blend of different meats ground fresh daily.  Even without a hangover decided to try the Hangover Part V Cure Burger.  It was cooked perfectly to my medium request and come with Bacon, Ham, Egg and Mayo.  A really good burger.  You get a rather large side of half sweet and half regular fries.
