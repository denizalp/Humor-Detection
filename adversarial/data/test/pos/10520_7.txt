After Urban Crawfish, we had to get some milk teas to hide that garlic breath! FYI - that's really not possible. That garlic be brutal. ha\n\nTea Space is located in a shopping strip next to a gas station and it looks a little sketchy from the outside. Once you walk inside, it's nicely decorated and if you're into cats - this place is for you! \n\nI ordered the small lavender milk tea with honey boba. The lavender flavor was very mild so I asked to have to add more but it was the same. It a syrup that they use so perhaps the lavender wasn't infused enough? The honey boba was good and highly recommended if you order a sinker.\n\nThe \"small\" is 16oz and the \"regular\" is 20oz which I found a little strange.
