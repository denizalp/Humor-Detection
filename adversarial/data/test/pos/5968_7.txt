Italian restaurant in Bellagio. The outside seating is probably superb, but since it was freezing in December, we opted to eat inside.\n\nBig group of friends went for lunch.For an appetizer, we ordered the short rib and truffle cheese flat bread. Like a thin new york style pizza. VERY good.\n\n Most people ordered the \"Olive's Hamburger\" - heard rave reviews! Surprisingly VERY filling - most of them could not finish the fries, let alone get the hamburger in thier mouths! haha It had to be taken apart to eat! So if you're not in for a messy lunch, skip this! Hamburger ($20 w\/truffle cheese. $16 w\/o truffle cheese). Some ordered the chicken breast ($20) and was very disappointed. The amount of food, especially compared to the hamburger was about 1\/2. It was a single chicken breast on top of a pureed potato? And some veges. The worst part was that the chicken was SUPER dry. I had a bite and did not want any more :( Those that ordered the chicken breast had to steal bread or fries from others! I ordered the special pasta of the day. It was a sword fish and shrimp pasta in red sauce ($23. and WOW. I know i had the best plate in our table. It was delicious. Everything was cooked really well. I can't believe the sword fish was able to retain such moisture! and all the flavors of the dish really complemented each other. I was very pleased. \n\nI was very very pleased with the service and quality of food. Would definately come here again. But probably again for lunch since a quick peak at the dinner menu.. I saw a lot of 40s, 50s, and 60s!
