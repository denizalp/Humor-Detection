Put this on the very top of the \"Don't Know WTF I Was Thinking\" List. Way back in the day, during my first trips to Vegas, back when I was really young and didn't know any better, I thought The Peppermill was one of the coolest places everrrrrr! Some guy took me here and I remember being so impressed. He had arranged for us to sit at one of those nice romantic, sunken-in fireplace areas and was acting like he had to pull some major strings to get us sat there but was able to pull it off because he was some big shot Vegas local, yada yada yada... I can almost hear my old self saying, \"Oh my gosh, you mean they have actual fireplaces in there and we can sit next to them? WOW!!!!!\" I seriously must have been easily amused and\/or completely wasted because this place is proof that some things are better left in the past as memories...\n\nI can't believe I was in such awe of The Peppermill back in the day. *SMDH* Boy times have changed! I walked in after having talked about how cool I remembered this place being and I was instantly embarrassed. My friend gave me that, \"Really Bobbi? This is THE Peppermill?\" puzzled look. Sadly, it was nowhere near as cool as I had remembered it being. The design is completely old school and tacky as all get out by today's standards. There are mirrors everywhere (I think even on the ceilings... bowmp chicka wow wow) and tons of neon. It reminded me of a scene out of the video game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards. Nate M. said it best, \"Is it a strip club or a Denny's on psychedelics?\" I could not stop giggling about the cheesy decor and for that I give this place three stars, for the entertainment value alone. I had a blast laughing at my past self while reading other's perceptions of this place. \n\nThis is your basic diner\/greasy spoon restaurant that is open 24\/7. Yes, The Peppermill is pretty famous but the food is nothing to write home about. If you're looking to feel like you've time warped into a scene from Austin Powers or people watch, this is the place. They serve those big touristy fishbowl style drinks that you can share with multiple straws. Service was good. \n\nDress like Larry from Three's Company and take someone on a date here and with a straight face, spritz some breath spray into your mouth, lean over and tell them this is your favorite restaurant, I dare you. LOLZ!
