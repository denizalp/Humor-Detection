Wow talk about your overpriced sushi joint. I understand Kabuki is inside a mall specifically designed for rich old people (Bayview Village) but seriously, I almost take offence at the level off rip-offing-ness that's happening here and almost more so when I'm forced to pay for the standard tea (yes it's an extra $1 \/ cup)! \n\nBut first let me take a breather and tell you about the place. The place looks like it could've been upscale back in the 80's but is seriously flawed in it's decor. The lights, colour stained glass, wierd metal object and thick black leather cushioned chairs just make this place tacky! Not to mention they then have soy sauce in plastic containers you can buy at the dollar store.\n\nOnce you're over the tackiness of the place you take a look at the menu, only to realize that their bento boxes are almost $30!!! And they don't even serve all the sides you'd get at downtown sushi joints for $10! Okay so bento is a no go, what about some good rolls? Dragon roll (shrimp tempura, mayo and cucumber) is $9.50 - okay kind of expensive but not too bad -  but hey about a small slice of salmon on top of the rolls (as in the pictures)? $15.50!!?!?!? How are they charging $6 extra for this?\n\nUgh, this place just made me frustrated. Have a look at the picture I uploaded, everything on that plate cost me $30... yeah I know, shame on me. The only reason I gave this play the second star was that the \"scorpion roll\" as they called it actually didn't taste too bad.
