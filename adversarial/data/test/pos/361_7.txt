As all are aware, I am not happy with American Furniture Warehouse.  I have been dealing with them over a couple of months now and they still won't honor the warranty, nor their verbal agreement (contract).  I decided to let them know how I feel about the situation with a little protest.\n\nJust found out, that this store isn't going to honor their second offer.  These clowns are out of control.  REMINDER:  It was the store that has made offers and, although the second offer I accepted under duress, I accepted the offers.  The store will not honor there word.   Liars!!!\n\nI have attached my video URL here:https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RCollins85234\/videos\/10208029119797637\/
