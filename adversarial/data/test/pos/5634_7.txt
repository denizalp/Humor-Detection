Like most of Sam Fox's establishments True Food is consistent. I came here a few days ago to meet some friends for a late lunch and it was surprisingly busy for the time of day. We waited about 20 minutes of the 30 we were quoted. Nice. Service was quick and friendly, I ordered the Scratch Bloody Mary and it was just ok. Pretty basic garnish and didn't have much flavor. For food I ended up with the Garden Scramble with sausage and avocado. The added avocado portion was pretty small with just a couple pieces. I'm glad I also added the sausage because it was kind of bland otherwise. I found myself breaking up the sausage to get some on each bite. There was supposed to be smoked gouda but that was nowhere to be seen (or tasted). I got a cup of chicken noodle soup and it was pretty forgettable. These types of places appeal to the masses but if you want top notch, unique food then this isn't your place.
