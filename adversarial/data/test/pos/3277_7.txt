Went on a Friday night.  I really must be getting old and behind the times because I have no idea what the hype is about this club.  The music is horrible - at one point, I was just looking out onto the dance floor, which was packed, and no one was dancing for at least a few songs!! I mean....how boring is that?!\n\nLuckily, I was staying at MGM and got in for free that night.  Thank goodness I didn't pay the $30 cover they were charging for non-hotel guests.
