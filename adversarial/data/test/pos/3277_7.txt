After trying Flower Child a few more times, it's really REALLY good. It is difficult finding better vegetables in this town, and the selection of bowls, wraps, or even salads are all above average and won't leave you feeling regret. \n\nI also don't think anyone can top their lemonades, with varieties like Rose Petal or Carrot-Ginger. \n\nI never regret coming here for lunch.
