Here for Country Fest. Horrible experience. Security line was so backed up then they just let about 500 people go through without being scanned. \n\nThen inside the drink line was very long about 100 people. I walk up front and I see only one bartender and the bar station next to him is t even open. \n\nOrleans Arena needs to get their act together.
