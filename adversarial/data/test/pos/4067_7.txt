Sky Bar,  Violet Candies, and Naughty Soda Drinks.\n\nLet us review: Sky bar, a delicious treat from the Necco factory (the place that makes the chalky valentine hearts that say stuff like \"fax me\" and \"text me ur heart\"). It is a masterpiece (even Dan Kennedy of Candy Freak fame has stated so) of candy delight for the indecisive. Caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and peanut butter filling each get one single solitary chocolate pyramid all joined together in a melty seatbelt of ooey gooey self contained bliss. You can nibble one at a time, or shove the whole thing in your mouth for a psychedelic mouthgasm. At a grand $2.50 (I am used to like 75cents, but being across the country in a desert of 112degrees can up that price), it is a bargain. http:\/\/www.necco.com\/ourbrands\/default.asp?brandid=11\n\nViolet Candies: the most appealing candy wrapper, I imagine myself in some kind of Victorian dress w\/a parasol all Anne of Green Gables and shit, offering the candy to my beau while he paddles our boat in a dapper vest. It tastes like springtime, like potpourri, like mysterious goth girls in the East Village in the late 70s, like Alice in Wonderland, it is glorious and perfumey. And in an appealing square shape with a texture resembling tic tacs, candy hearts, candy necklaces and certs. It is like a grand of $1.50 I believe. http:\/\/victoryseeds.com\/candystore\/chowards_violet.html\n\nNaughty Sodas. I am not much of a soda drinker-I quit all the caramel coloured sodas in 3rd grade cold turkey and never looked back. BUT I do have an extremely soft spot for root beer, orange, grape and other novelty flavours. Especially Stewart's brand. Back on the east coast, we had lil drive throughs that serve Black Cows, which is a root beer float. But Stewart's root beer is a masterpiece. Virgils is creamy and spicey, Hansens has a real licorice taste, Dr. Browns is anise tasty, but only Stewart's gets my vote every time. They had that one, cream soda, orange n cream, lime rickey, Jones Soda, Virgil's, and way too many other brands\/flavors to count. Truly a refreshing way to cool down while perusing the strip. http:\/\/www.drinkstewarts.com\/\n\nEverything else. Well. There are some cool cupcake wrappers. And we were endlessly amused by the huge bouncy balls, but not $15 amused. The prices werent terrible, a lot of the same merch is at Urban for twice\/three times as much. The wall w\/photo booth is cute. I just don't get what they are going for. I was excited for this place, but I don't think it will be its own destination for myself personally.\n\nAnd I agree w\/everyone- more candy! Or cupcakes. Or food. Dang, there ain't no food in that corner and a lady gets hungry doin' all that browsing. And Dairy Queen doesn't quite get it. Maybe if they put in a pretzel machine or a soft serve or just had some other unique hand dipped candys?\n\nCould it be I am not much of a novelty girl?\n\nHmmm...violet flavoured soda filling in a Sky bar....
