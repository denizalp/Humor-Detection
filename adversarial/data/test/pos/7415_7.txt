Went there during group grand opening today. When I placed my order, person at register never asked if I was dining in or taking out. And then when I asked if I need a number to give them my name or something for them to bring it to my table, he argued that it says carry out in his computer. This is the same person who just took my order I never asked for order to go. \n\nAnyways, I was very excited about some great Caribbean food, but never did get to find out how good or bad it was. 30 minutes later, I have still not received anything and needed to cancel. Old unstable tables outside on patio, very poor service for having so many employees on hand yet not putting food out of the kitchen in anything close to a timely manner. Nobody ever came by table to check on me even though restaurant had a good size staff. I left very disappointed and hungry.
