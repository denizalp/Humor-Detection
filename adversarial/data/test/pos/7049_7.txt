Ok - I like Loop. I love the store itself... the decor consists of walls & walls of vinyl records and CDs. You can listen... or just sit among the awesomeness of it all. \n\nI don't love the people who work here. They are just kind of... rude? unfriendly? awkward? I don't know. They certainly don't make you feel welcome. Small talk while you're waiting? Forget it. Smiles? Don't think about it. It really kind of turns me off... \n\nThe coffee is good. As good as any other specialty coffee shop. Solid, good baristas. They just aren't friendly. At all.
