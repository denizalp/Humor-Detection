Only 1 Chuck E Cheese's in Calgary = Mayhem on a Saturday!\n\nWas here for a 2 year old's bday party on a Saturday.... talk about CRAZY and LOUD, bells and alarms every which way and felt like there were millions of kids screaming and running everywhere haha... It was sooo busy that there were line ups for rides and some games (for the little ones of course - haha).\n\nIf you're there for a bday party, don't line up... head on in to the gate on the left side and let them know, they'll let you bypass the line (Thank goodness!)\n\nFood:  pizza, fries, an app platter (with chicken wings, celery, fried cheese, etc) and a salad bar. \n\nPhew... was exhausted after 3 hrs! :) haha.
