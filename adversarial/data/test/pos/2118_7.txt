I was here earlier in the week and had a pretty average experience.  As another reviewer said, there really isn't a hostess so you have to catch a server's eye to be directed to a table.\n\nThe menus are on the table but it took a while for someone to get me a drink and take my order.  Speaking of drinks, I was interested in one of their $3 Arnold Palmers but when I asked about refills or to go cups and was told that's not what they do I decided to pass.\n\nOn a positive note, my corned beef sandwich had good taste.  If you are it's thinking a large deli-sized corned beef sandwich then think again.  This was more of a ladies-who-lunch portion.\n\nI'm not sure that I'd seek this place out again.  There are a lot of other great options in this neighborhood.
