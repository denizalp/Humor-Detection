You know you are boring new parents when sending the baby to the MIL, ordering wings and renting a movie makes for a fabulous Valentines day.  Unfortunately our night was only marred by the choice of wings.  Shoulda gone to our old standby of Bistro on Ave (a St Louis joint).\n\nWe got take out so I can't comment on anything other than the food. The wings themselves are suspiciously large, like how big was that chicken?  That may appeal to some but I'm a fan of the non-drumstick and like to work a bit for the wing meat. Got the honey garlic which was a waste of time but luckily the side of hot honey garlic sauce I ordered saved the day.  The medium is really Tabasco-y if you are into that.\n\nThe fries were mundane and the large order was excessive for two. (The dogs got a great breakfast the next day). \n\nBut now I can say I've had Duff's wings.  Not really my thing.\n\nBTW the movie was District 9.  Now THAT was good.
