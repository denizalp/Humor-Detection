I'm going to make an excellent senior citizen one day, because I love soup and trying soups around CLE. Souper Market has a pretty big selection, and also has salads, sandwiches and vegetarian options if you need them.\n\nMy vegetarian friend and I stopped by and did a soup and sandwich for lunch. I had the grilled cheese and the chicken paprikash soup. The grilled cheese had huge slices of delicious bread, but not a lot of cheese or flavor (I know, huge side face). The chicken paprikash, however, had such an awesome flavor. It was hearty, rich and I can totally understand why its a customer favorite. It tasted like something my grandmother would have made! Next time, I'll skip the sandwich and just get soup.\n\nSouper Market is located on Lorain Avenue. If you hit it before noon or after 1pm, you can almost immediately find a meter right outside on non-West Side Market Day. Its also very affordable, so give it a try, my fellow soup loving friends!
