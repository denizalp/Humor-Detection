Changing Hands is my favorite bookstore in the valley!  (Haven't tried Bookman's or Bookstar, yet.)  It is truly such a treat to stop by here everytime.  I really must visit often.  I love the occasional book readings\/signings held here.  My first-ever was Gilbert's _Eat Pray Love_.  How fun!!  Another nice event was the complimentary viewing of \"An Inconvenient Truth.\"  I'd wanted to see that movie for many months, and it was nice to finally view it here and then have a Q&A session afterwards.  \n\nI enjoy the clusters of privacy and gift-sections to be found throughout the store.  Having Wildflower Bread Co. next door is quite convenient, although I always seemed to have just dined whenever I visit CHB... I'll have to make it a point to eat at Wildflower before shopping for books on my next visit!
