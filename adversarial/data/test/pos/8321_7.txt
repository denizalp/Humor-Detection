There really isn't a shortage of parking here, even on a beautiful Sunday! Plus, picnic tables. This was my first time at this park for a hike, so without looking at the map too carefully (first mistake), we set off in the direction of what looked like a nice little curving hike going up off to the left of the parking areas. There were way less people going that way (for a reason I didn't know at the time). Looking to the right, we could see many people heading up and down, so why go that way? You'll want to look carefully at the map before setting off because it really is a great source of information about the elevation changes and then perhaps reading here on Yelp might also be more information about which trail would be right for you.\n\nThat lovely trail off to the left that I was on was trail #40 and then trail #44 (which wasn't so lovely near the top). At least I'm pretty sure those were the trail #'s. We met a few informative people who said that if we got to the very top, then it becomes a paved road down the other side. I so wished that I could make it to the paved trail. Unfortunately, there was too much steep scrambling for my knee (which had been overworked for the last several days on other daily hiking treks), and I didn't want to end up seeing my daughter in the emergency room, so I had us turn back, sadly. This is not to say that you should not attempt it. It really isn't all that bad; it was just not my day to do this particular route, and maybe there is something to be said about all the other people choosing to go to the right. Oh, to be young again... \n\nI'm still giving this place 5 stars because it isn't the mountain's fault that the route I'd chosen for the day wasn't the one for me. The views were absolutely spectacular at several spots that I stopped to take a moment and look at something other than my feet and the trail. I'd also wished that I'd managed to get my phone out to take a few pictures!\n\nI'm going to study the trails, read the Yelp reviews carefully, and attempt some additional hikes in North Mountain Park! If you are used to scrambling up a few steep spots (just a few), then this would be the route for you, but please take my advice: read the map carefully before heading out in whatever direction you choose.
