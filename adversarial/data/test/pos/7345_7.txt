************************* UPDATE REVIEW ************************\n\n  Rose.Rabbit.Lie is very unique restaurant, 1 of the most exciting on the Strip, serving delicious food, strong cocktails,  interactive shows, fascinating, and I didn't know what to expect. Late night dining with reinvented social club.\n\n    Expect the unexpected, shows through out the dinner. You can laugh and it's truly Vegas style. It's grand, and it's surely delivered. \n\n     This time I got to chat with chef Wesley Holton, who formerly worked at Daniel in New York, then Daniel Boulud's DB Brasserie at Wynn Las Vegas as well as The Water Club and Michael Mina's Seablue at the Borgata in Atlantic City, helms the kitchen. \n\n   The food was on point, we love everything. \n\n- Scallops were so good with black truffles, OK everything truffles are good in my book :-)\n\n- The bone marrow, a MUST ORDER!\n\n- Rabbit Fricassée, Vichy Carrots, Rose Petals, Beech Mushrooms à la Grecque, Sauce Zingara, MUST TRY.\n\n- Wagyu Steak Frites, Sauce Choron, Tempura Potatoes, Wilted Spinach was quite tasty. \n\n- Crispy Chicken, Potato & Scallion Pureé, Black Truffle, yes truffle!\n\n- Florida Frog Leg, Pickled Fava Bean, Cilantro-Lime Chimichurri, unexpected but was quite nice.\n\n- Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly, Fava Bean, Bacon Consommé, Preserved Ramps, ORDER IT!\n\n- Beef Wellington, Prime Tenderloin, Puff Pastry Atrium, Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Creamed Spinach, Roasted Maitake, Black Truffle. This is a GIGANTIC plate, will feed a whole table ;-) so much flavor, layer to layer of goodness gracious! \n\n- Amazing caviar selection here, from California Sturgeon to Russian Osetra, to Siberian Osetra, to Hackleback, you only live once, so order it :-)\n\n   The wine list was equally delicious here. \n\n- Shafer Hillside Select 2009 Stagleap Napa Valley $600 per bottle\n\n- 1995 Chateau Latour Bordeaux $2,500 \n\n- Krug Champagne baby, when you go Krug, it's difficult for you to go back :-) \n\n  Our group got so much fun, we got up and danced with the performers. You won't be able to talk to each other much because it was loud.  However, our group, my clients, love every bit of it. \n\n    Our waitress and the sommelier were both wonderful on JAN 8th, 2015. I'm looking forward to return soon. THANK YOU chef Wes Holton for an amazing dinner. \n\n    Rose.Rabbit.Lie is something NEW and UNEXPECTED for you to try out. Still 1 of the hottest shows in Las Vegas now and 1 of my favorite.
