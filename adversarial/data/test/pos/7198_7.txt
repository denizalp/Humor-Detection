Come hungry, leave happy. How hungry are you? Picture your plate the size of the table...now eat the table! Hash House is not playing around. They want to feed you and ALL of your friends! \n\nI love breakfast foods... It's one of my favorite things to eat.  I usually love breakfast for dinner. However, when I'm in Vegas we eat whenever there is a break between clubbing, napping, and getting ready. After going to the club one night I convinced some of the girls I was with to stop and eat. I think they were drunk enough to follow me so we ended up here. I saw the chicken and waffles on yelp and I knew they had to be mine.\n\nThe table wanted the chicken and waffles too but I also wanted a pancake. Little did I know that it was going to be way TOO MUCH food! We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower for 18.00. It comes with drizzled hot maple syrup & fried leeks. I also ordered The Pancake Tractor Driver Combo for 14.29 ($1 for specialty pancakes). It came with eggs, bacon, hash browns and a buttermilk pancake. I substituted brown sugar pancakes. I also got egg whites and chicken sausage since I don't eat pork. I had to save calories where I could. I didn't realize I was going to be able to put a dent into my food.\n\nCome big or stay home! You will NEED to share unless you can eat mass quantities of food and are a tractor. The food was so good I honestly wish I could've finished it. However my goal is not to look like a tractor so I need to eat in smaller quantities. I will be back but I plan on sharing!
