Sushi eye for the queer guy? \n\n(I will proceed using the non-homosexual usage of this word, so don't censor me Yelp)\n\nQueer: differing in some odd way from what is usual or normal \n\nNow, the only thing that comes from Sushi Eye are beer and queer, and I don't see any beer on the table....\n\nThe reason I say this, is because it took about 10 minutes for my lovely date and I to get a drink! ....Very queer you say? \n\nSo we sat down in the cafeteria like setting, and wondered if we made the wrong choice. As we patiently waited, we contemplated bailing on this joint, and trying another place, however we sat, fuming a bit at the slow service. Finally our server stopped over and she was super nice, and explained she was the daughter of the owners and never waitressed before. My brain says \"Oh boy.\" I asked her several sushi questions, stumping her each time, she is new remember? So finally we placed our order and got our beers and started talking about important things like \"would you eat fugu (Japaneses blowfish)?\"  At this point I would eat it, hoping to be poisoned, so I could get out of this place. Relax you say. So the sushi was Ok, the pieces were very small, but somewhat tasty. I immediately thought of Will Rogers: \"I never met a piece of Sushi I didn't like.\" (Now did he mean he liked them or he didn't like them?)\n Unfortunately the bad service, terrible decor, and cafeteria like setting made me dislike this place. How queer you say, A sushi place that you don't like? Yes, it can happen, as I hate Ra.....Don't do it..
