I used a groupon to try out this studio which gave me two barre classes and two pilates classes for $29.  This barre studio shares space with a pilates studio, which is a separate business (you have to fill out separate waivers for both).  Friendly staff.  They took the groupon without an issue.\n\nThese classes will kick your butt but they surprisingly do not involve too much bar work.  Just a lot of time on a mat with light weights.  If you go to enough classes and are motivated, you could probably come up with your own routine.  Some of the exercises are pretty inventive.  Small classes with personal attention.\n\nThe class schedule bums me out.  It's very limited and seems geared toward housewives or something.  I can't make most of the classes.  I really struggled just to fit my two classes in.\n\nPlus it's pretty expensive.  I think they had a special - $249\/month for unlimited barre and pilates classes but unlimited means only one class of each type per day.  Not that you would want to do barre more than once a day.  You will be so sore.  Otherwise classes range from $15 to $18 each depending on how many you buy upfront.
