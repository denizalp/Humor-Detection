Woooohoooooo, if u like Island Pacific or Greenland, then you'll LOVE Seafood City! \n\nAnd the fact that it's closer to my house (not that much closer but, closer than the UNLV one) is a plus. \n\nI've been there 3x since it's opening and usually in the mornings...for random Asian groceries but, mainly for their precooked dishes. \n\nI LOVE their tuyo. Fried sardines. So stinky but, so salty and yummy :) it's something that's hard to cook in the house as it'll linger in the kitchen for days. So coming here to pick that up is so much more convenient! \n\nThey also have cooked bbq pork belly and salt and pepper shrimp (with heads on)!!!! \n\nExcited that they look to opening up an even BIGGER seafood city on Rainbow Blvd. \n\n**i just wish either location closed at midnight like the original UNLV location**
