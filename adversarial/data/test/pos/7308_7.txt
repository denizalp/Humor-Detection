Local produce. Love it. I love a good sandwich, and after looking over the pictures on Yelp, I needed to try one of each. I ended up getting the Greek Pide (pronounced pee-day), it was like a Greek salad in a doughy basket. It was delicious. Also snuck a meatball slider off my friends plate, that was equally good. To balance my lunch and to make myself feel better, I order one of their fresh squeezed green juices. They have plenty of juice\/smoothie options.\n\nI love the salads here, you can order by the scoop, and it's so cheap! I had a full plate (only two scoops) and it was $5.68. Right! \n\nWhat a great family owned cafe, at the corner of Rainbow\/Tropicana.
