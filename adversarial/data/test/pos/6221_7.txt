I have had Bennett Property Management for over 10 years and they have always exceeded my expectations. They recently renewed a tenant for another 12-month lease and it went very  smoothly. I appreciate Kate, our assigned agent, for keeping us updated as the process proceeded. I would strongly recommend Bennett Property Management to anyone who does not want to do their own rental management.
