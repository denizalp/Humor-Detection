(Lyrics - Kelis - Bossy)\n\nIl Bosco\nIt's a fresh bite to scream up my Yelp\nIt switched up the beat to my heart\nThat's right it brought imported cheese to the boulevard\nAnd that's right, it's the one who's firewood oven to start \n\nIl Bosco\nIt's a place y'all love to date\nIt's a place that's raised the stakes\nI told Yelp Phoenix there's no debate\nI'm back with an appetite cause it's Bosco\n\n\nIl Bosco Pizza is a locally own spot quaint and popping with some firewood cooked pizza; this place definitely has a lovely charm to it.  \n\nI came on a rainy evening so the place inside was packing!  I would say the inside seats a max of 35 people including the bar.  The open kitchen where you can see the firewood oven was an allure while chef craft his work.  \n\nWe started with a bottle of wine plus some Fried Ravioli.  The ravioli came along with some sweet marinara sauce and had a decent soft doughiness to it.  Next we shot for the Caprese Salad; which was my favorite.  It came with Burrata cheese along with the traditional Mozzarella cheese, tomato, and balsamic.  Overall, one of my favorite bites of the night.  Fluffy burrata along with smooth and stringy mozzarella cheese ending with a sweet balsamic punch.  \n\nFor our pizza we ordered their Biaggia & Carmela.  The Biaggia came with prociutto, fig jam, four cheese, and arugula.  Overall, a decent bite but I felt the arugula was over-powering.  The fig jam was light and I wish they would put more on it.  The Carmela came with tomato sauce, sausage, spinach, and caramelized onions.  The tomato sauce was a welcoming pairing with the saltiness of the sausage and sweet onions.\n\nIn the end, Il Bosco Pizza is a little sweet spot for some farm to table pizza.  Traditional Italian bites with some allure of the ambiance.  The firewood oven is awesome to watch, but not sure how well it fares during the summer months. - Enjoy!
