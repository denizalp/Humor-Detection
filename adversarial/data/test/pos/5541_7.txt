I have been to Deville Dinebar one other time and remembered they had a fun menu for drinks which inspired my second visit on a cold winter evening. \nI had made reservations using open table for 4 people at 5 pm. Making my way up to the second floor was a nuisance, as there is one long alley\/walkway for clients and the staff to use. No coat hooks nearby with little space for storing personal items. The layout on the second floor is very crammed compared to the spacious first floor. \n\nFunny story: the hostess placed me and my friends at two separate tables when we had one reservation under my name. How does that happen??? When I asked our waiter in regards to the mix up, he termed it \"a glitch in the system\". Glitch or confusion? \n\nMenu: the menus are bulky and rather large to use in a tiny space you're stuck in. Yet these menus are fun! Drink specials are offered daily -and I was surprised to even see a fish bowl menu, haven't seen fish bowls around in Mtl. I ended up ordering gummies on the beach with their 2$ off the candy bar menu on Thursdays. This drink was a twist on a sex on the beach with gummy bears that tasted oddly gelatinous because they were served chilled-(for 11$ it was an ok drink). The food menu was on the pricey side. Starting at 20$ on average going up to 40$ per main course. They specialize in American cuisine. I tried the ahi tuna tacos (4\/5) for 22$ that came in 3 servings-i really enjoyed the flakey taco shell with the slaw and a genius slice of tuna-lightly grilled on the outside. For my main course: I had the short back beef ribs with Mac n cheese (3\/5) the portion was very generous and presentation was beautiful. The meat was cooked super well, very tender, but the seasoning was a tad on the salty side. Whereas, the mac n cheese was a bit on the underseasoned side. The two served together didn't really jive well for me. I was glad to have tried it.\n\nService: I wasn't too happy with the service we received, frankly because I felt rushed into ordering right away. I really appreciated the fact the servers knew the menu inside out, they were good with making recommendations -but a lot of the items from the drink menu were also missing. \n\nThis was an eventful dining experience but for the 100$ I dropped I would've rather gone with a more upscale restaurant in old Montreal.  Overpriced meals for the quality of the food you get!
