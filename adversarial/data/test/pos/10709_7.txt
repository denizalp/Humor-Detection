I went into open an account because I had a cash bonus of $300 if you open a chase total checking account and set up direct deposit. You don't get the money until after 90 days, but I figured it was worth it. When I went in to set up the account, they told me I would need an appointment because they were busy. Nobody was there except me and one other person talking to the other account manager. (That conversation consisted of the lady trying to explain why Chase is not releasing the cash deposit he made earlier today because it is not showing up in their system anywhere due to a \"glitch\"). *smh\n\nThe account manager told me he had an appointment at two, and it was 1:40 so I asked him how long it would take to open an account. He said it would take between 30 and 45 minutes. I was a little shocked by that. He told me to come back at 5. LMAO. I don't think so. \n\nI can't believe they let a new account walk out of their office without a second thought. That is definitely not customer service. Little did he know I had $15K to deposit in their bank as well. Oh well, I'll try another bank.
