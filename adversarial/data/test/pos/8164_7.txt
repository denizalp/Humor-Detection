Wow,  I really liked this place.  It wasn't what I had initially expected, but my visit was definitely fun!  I had no problems with any of the machines malfunctioning.  There were a few that were out of service, but that's expected.  I haven't played pinball in awhile... this place definitely brought some memories back.  We spent a good hour playing games without even realizing how long we had been there. Most definitely a Nostalgic experience!\n\nPros:\n *  They had some pretty good deals on some of the pinball machines (such as an extra credit depending on how much you initially purchase)\n *  There really is no place in Vegas like this!\n *  stools for you to sit if you fancy\n\nCons:\n *  Not enough stools, but whatever ha\n *  A bit dark, but that's no biggie either... Its not like I expected to play in a building with more spotlights than a baseball field.  That would cause some major glare issues.\n\nTips:\n * Bring some deep pockets for all your quarters\n * Give yourself at least an hour to take in all the pinball machines\n * There are some non-pinball games towards the right side.\n\nOverall:\n *  I'd definitely come here again and recommend those who have yet to go.  It's definitely one-of-a-kind and perfect for the whole family.
