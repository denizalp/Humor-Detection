So Magic Oven finally comes to the Junction! Hooray!\n\nI lived in the Annex previously and for a while ordered from the Magic Oven there, as I have dietary needs that only they can meet for ordering in pizza.\n\nUntil the quality dipped and it started taking 2 hours+ for pizza to be delivered.\n\nSo a new one is opened, and I called them up, ordered 2 small pizzas for delivery.\n\nWell he said it would take 1 hour, which I expected, and that it would cost $42 for two small pizzas, which I also expected.\n\nThey showed up almost 2 hours later, even though I live about a 9-10 min drive from the place (it was 9:00 at night too, no traffic), and the pizzas were ice cold.\n\nYaaaay :\/\n\n$40+ for 2 hour delivery for ice cold pizzas? Here we go again.\n\nIts a shame as once we re-heated the pizza the flavors were actually REALLY good, but the crusts had gone a bit hard in the process. I wish I could have tasted this piping hot but apparently that's not something Magic Oven can do these days.\n\nThey JUST opened so.. maybe in a few months if I get desperate I'll try again. Maybe.
