What a unique seafood experience in the middle of the desert! Let me give you a few tips from one newbie to another. The entrance is not obvious. We walked around the building before figuring out that you enter through the patio seating (with nice misters!). We were almost seated in the sea of tables but requested one of the open booths, which are covered in intentional graffiti. Bring a sharpie to join the mix. \n\nWe waited about 15-20 min for our server to greet us and take our drink order. Normally, we would be a bit annoyed but Michelle was so pleasant and helpful that the timing was easy to overlook.  You can only buy by the pound (not 1\/2 or 1\/4 lb) and we were bummed that lobster only comes in 2-3 lbs...which makes sense because you get a whole lobster. At $21 per pound, that was too rich for our blood with the other goodies we wanted. We (husband and I) ended up getting:\n\nHush puppies\n1 lb shrimp (trifecta with spice level 1)\n1 lb king crab (traditional boil, spice 1)\n1 bag veggies (trifecta with spice level 1)\nSausage\nCorn\nPotatoes\n\nWe got the food within 10 min of ordering and they had great happy hour drink specials. No happy hour apps but they are already cheap. We were not given all of the items we ordered nor did they bring us bibs and the tools to crack through our crab. Not sure why these aren't already at tables when you arrive? We had to wait quite awhile(15 min) after asking to get these items. It also would have been nice to get forks with the veggie bag, as they are soaked in yummy, scalding sauce bag. Veggies included sweet potato, broccoli, mushroom, pepper, squash and a pineapple. \n\nThe hush puppies were tasty and moist and the ranch dipper perfect. The shrimp was pretty good but didn't have much flavor once you take off shell. Get a side of sauce or dip it in your bag. The trifecta sauce was tasty and super garlic-tastic. I will add that even with level 1 spice, it still had a kick and my nose was running. There were about 10 large shrimp in a pound. Keep in mind the head, eyes and legs are still on these if you have a squeamish guest with you. \n\nThe king crab legs (about 2 1\/2 per lb) were AMAZING. A bit pricey at $24 p\/lb but totally worth it! Meaty, fresh and flavorful and the traditional boil sauce recommended to us was awesome.The potatoes and sausage  were great but the corn was mushy and overcooked and could have used more soaking in the sauce. \n\nAfter using hands to eat every little piece of saucy food, you will go through a million napkins. Just toss them in the provided bucket with your shells and they will compost them. There is a sink next to the kitchen to wash your hands after the meal, which is appreciated. \n\nWe will be back again to get king crab legs (trad. Boil sauce), veggie bag (trifecta sauce) and add potatoes. We will pass on shrimp and corn next time. Enjoy the fun and don't bring anyone prissy who can't get down and dirty.
