I don't get it. \n\nAfter 2 visits, all I can say is Point Brugge completes the triumphant of \"Restaurants That Start With The Letter \"P\"' that Pittsburghers inexplicably revere and line-up for. Pamela's and Primanti's being the other two. \n\nMy brunch cassoulet was an over-priced and over-cooked combination of white beans, duck confit, and soggy bread crumb topping. Seemingly void of the bacon and sausage described in the menu. As well as any French bread for mopping up the bowl. \n\nFor the portion size, paying about 1\/3 less may have been acceptable.\n\nI don't even recall what I had on my first visit, but clearly it wasn't anything memorable.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, not my thing either - too loud. \n\nTables aren't cramped too tightly together at least. Service is generally friendly and genuine. \n\nThink I'll stick to brunch at home....
