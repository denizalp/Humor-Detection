I have to say this: while I generally was prepared to dislike Suburban Express or find their service irritating, it's simply untrue for me.\n\nI have been very very happy with my experiences with Suburban Express in getting to and from Chicago airports.  They're very reliable, timely, and the service is very friendly.  They just added wifi to their buses as well, which them extra kudos from me, although I must admit that an hour of typing on the laptop on a bumpy highway almost made me want to hurl.  Still, it's a nice gesture from the service.\n\nI rode down from midway to U of I this past week after Christmas break and I was unlucky enough to forget my iPod on the shuttle, somethign I didnt' realize until I got home, a half hour later.  I was pretty sad about that, and angry, and had given up for lost when I called Suburban Express the next morning.  To my surprise they had it ready and waiting for me when I gratefully showed up soon afterward.  \n\nMy only complaint with SE is their website.  When ordering tickets online be sure you're next to a printing computer or you are screwed.  It is a \"one time only print out your ticket now or you've given us $40+ for nothing\" kinda deal.  Somewhat stressful, for example, when your printer runs out of ink, or yoru browser crashes mid click.  That said, when you actually get to the shuttle, they're professional, kind, and helpful.  And I'm happy to use them.
