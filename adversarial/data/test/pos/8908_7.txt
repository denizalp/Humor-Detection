Disgusting. The Rattlesnake bites were so spicy that they had no taste, just heat. We asked the server prior to ordering how hot they were and she said a little spice. Ron, the manager??? If you can call him that..in all honesty he was a pathetic excuse of a manager and should not be in that job position. I told him they were terrible when he asked how we liked them and his response was \" they are a big seller, we make them in house\". Not I'm sorry for your experience....made in house or not, Ron, they are awful! \nThe ribs were tough and inedible and the bowl of mashed potatoes that we paid extra to have \"loaded\" had very little cheese a few bacon crumbles and no butter or sour cream. Ron was useless with this as well....told us he was uncomfortable talking to us and went and got a different manager...she was good, Ron, you need a new job choice..you are lousy at customer service. She comped our inedible uneaten meals and we left...our server did offer to box them up but my guess is ribs like rubber in the restaurant will still taste like rubber at home. Save your money and go elsewhere...terrible experience every time we go there.
