Let me tell you about Cibo..\n\nWe went last night after seeing Kathy Griffin so we were both in dazzeling moods having laughed all night.. well leave to someone to suck the good out of your mood right quick.\n\nWe arrived at Cibo right at 10, they close at 11. The usual host and hostess sat next to the door chatting with some friends. The waiters were sitting at the large table in the front wrapping silverware and the bartender well he just ignored us completely. Finally one of the waiters asked if wanted a table.. no we would like to stand their and smell the pizza! Duh! So we asked him to hold one moment as we used the restroom real quick. Then when we came back he was gone and we were standing there once again being ignored. Finally the bartender made a huge sigh and asked of there were only 2 of us.. so he takes us to the left dining room and there are only 2 tables in there.. guess where he sat us.. right next to a couple that looked like they getting VERY romantic.. so they gave us crusty looks.. I then asked the bartender if we could just sit at the bar (I can appreciate someone wanting space, I didn't want to sit next to them either).. so he turns and looks to me, sighed again and said \"if you want\".. like those words were somehow causing his hair to fall out. So I said \"Oh wait, I wouldn't want to put you out!\".. he then just turned and stormed towards the bar.. the Mr stopped him and said never mind.. (he didn't want him waiting on us after that little episode) so we sat next to the couple.. they looked at us like we had just interrupted a marriage proposal and she hadn't quite answered yet.\n\nSo Im mad as all heck.. Ive been treated badly before but I gotta know you before you can walk all over me! Im SO over Cibo at this point and ready to leave but the Mr talked me into staying.. he has this special talent of calming the beast, not that I turn green and tear my clothes off or anything but my tongue has been known to be very sharp! \n\nWaiter arrives takes our drink order.. nice wine list though very small.. he returns with the drinks and takes our dinner order.. antipasti, a rustica and a tricolore.. I asked if I could have prosciutto put on top.. you know what he says.. \"Ill ask the chef if you can have that.. he doesn't like changing HIS pizza's\".. I cocked my head at him (I think the vein in my forehead was ready explode) \"he doesn't like to change his pizza's\".. if you offer toppings on the menu for an up-charge, wouldn't you think they would actually give them to you? Talk about the dang pizza nazi! The waiter returns a few moments later or the 'chefs messenger'  (I think he was sweating) tells me that the chef has agreed to let me have the proccutio but only on a plate. Oh thank you thank you oh lord oh messiah! \n\nCan you believe this place?\n\nWhile the food was good the attitudes here has really put me off.. so the 2 stars are for food only.. the Mr and I will never come to this place again.. Cibo has officially been scratched from our minds. Oh, I will be sending this review to them as well.. that way if they even care, which I doubt, they will address not only the bartenders attitude (little scruffy guy) but the idea that the customer pays their light bill and tells all of their friends about the place!
