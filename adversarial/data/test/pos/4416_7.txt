I like going to Monki for breakfast because I know I'll always get great service. And on Sunday mornings, I usually need all the enthusiasm and smiles I can get from other people - something that's almost always guaranteed with a Monki visit. \n\nThe chorizo eggs benedict is amazing! I think some breakfast places need to rethink the \"heavy breakfast\" idea because their servings are bordering on excessive - that was not the case for Monki. The serving was just the right size that you can actually finish your order without feeling sluggish after a filling breakfast. I liked the brisket hash too. It was a little oily but it still came out full of flavor. \n\nThe Macaroni and cheese - I cannot even begin to explain how good this is. Just order it. I usually cannot say no to mac and cheese so I ordered this at 9am. It's full of lobster flavors, it's cheesy and it has bacon - everything you can ask for in a mac and cheese!\n\nThanks Monki for serving great breakfast! You guys are breakfast rock stars!! :)
