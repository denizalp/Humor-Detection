This is my first time at this location. I love their food and juices.\n\nHad the Harvest Kale salad and pumpkin loaf. The salad was delicious and very \"citrusy.\" I'm not sure if the pumpkin bread is seasonal but it was also very good.\n\nMy sister had the turkey club and sweet potato french fries and said it was good.\n\nSolid food all-around!
