Thieves. I purchased a livingsocial offer for Red Rock Casino Resort, paying $219 for a two-night weekend stay. The promotional dates for the room offer expired but the voucher states that it has a paid value ($219) redeemable with the merchant for up to five years. I was willing to use the credit in any form (room, food, or drinks) at the resort, but Red Rock under manager Greg Turco refused to honor the voucher in any way. Mr. Turco informed me that he has turned away multiple other customers with the same vouchers. I was not looking for a promotional offer, only a way to spend the money that I already paid. \n\nlivingsocial is not some fly-by-night coupon site. There are terms that merchants must agree to if they sell offers through the service. Red Rock agreed to these terms and received payment from livingsocial from me and other livingsocial customers -- and now refuses to honor that agreement to provide consideration to those customers. \n\nI have stayed and played here several times previously, but this experience is enough to turn me away for good. It's disappointing that they force a once-loyal customer to take them to small claims court to recover such a petty amount of money, but they have unlawfully kept it without providing any goods or services so I have no other recourse. \n\nDo not do business with this company. There are better places to stay.
