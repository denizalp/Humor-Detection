I was super excited to finally try this place and i am happy to say it did not disappoint. The food was delicious and service was great. I loved the pretzel bread they brought us out before the entrees. One of my favorite things were their mac&cheese balls, ugh the dipping sauce was so good. Then to finish off we had the edible flower pot. I thought it was going to probably be dry since the outer layer was a little hard to cut into but boy was I wrong. The inside was a super rich and moist chocolate cake with chocolate mouse. The outer layer ended up being super good too as it was just a chocolate mold. I loved the whole look of this place and I am seriously super excited to go back and try different things.
