I don't have boba tea often but I really like this spot for their fully-customizable drinks and easy-access location. Prices are low and their grand opening promo loyalty card only requires 4 drink purchases to reach a freebie!\n\n+ Customize your drink sweetness and ice level, pay under $4 for a large!\n+ Self serve boba and topping bar to mix and match up to ~1\/4 cup full.\n+ Taste a sample cup to test sweetness before they serve your drink, so they can adjust rather than remake.\n+ Location is quiet with WiFi and plenty of parking spaces.\n\nI recommend the green rose milk tea, less sweet with light ice, with lychee and honey boba. They also have a sea salt foam add-on for $1 more if you're into that. My order is regularly dollar or two less than elsewhere and exactly how I like it!
