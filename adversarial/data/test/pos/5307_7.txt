While in the past we have enjoyed the BBQ from this establishment, sadly today they earned a 1 star rating from a livid customer.  It is Sunday, and this location is open 11-7pm, one would think during those hours they plan to serve customers.  Not the case.  At 6pm...you know...dinner time, we go in to buy pork BBQ and get told they don't have any...yet they are still open for some reason........their reasoning for this is that they close at 7 so they wouldn't cook more??  I found this reason both lazy and unacceptable for a pork BBQ restaurant.  If you don't want to serve people at dinner time then close earlier and save us the time of going to your establishment only to be turned away wasting my time and thus losing any future business you would possibly receive from us.  I hope the owners of The Rock Store happen to read this and can understand how asinine it is for a BBQ place to not have BBQ at dinner time on the weekend.  Shut down early so your lazy incompetent employees who think this is excusable practice can go home and not pretend to be open for business when there is no food....at 6 o'clock...you know, when most of the country eats a meal...\n\nFresh food is deserved by all who are willing to support your business and pay for your product no matter if its 6 hours to close or 15 minutes.  Choosing your restaurant as we have many times in the past to only be offered \"whatever we have left\" at 6pm is unacceptable.  I get that shortages happen, I really do.  My problem is that is was 6 fucking o'clock...
