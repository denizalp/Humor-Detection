Quite easily, the best pho in Charlotte.  It's currently a four-star rating, but that's only because I haven't tried the rest of their dishes.  One less star just means there's room to grow - I don't want to cap its potential!\n\nThis place is a bit under the radar.  Everyone raves about Vietnam Grille, Pho Hoa, Saigon Palace, etc. but none of them beat the pho at Doan's.  It's time to blow this place up and let everyone know:\n\nThe broth is unbeatable.  Have you made ramen noodles and poured in that powder soup base?  The directions generally say you should add the powder after the water is boiling.  What ends up happening is that the soup still just tastes a bit watery and bland.  Sure, it's fully dissolved, but it's different from when you just pour the powder in with the water, pre-boil.  (Yeah, I'm a ramen master... I got accoutrements you can't even imagine!).  So... back to the broth - it's nowhere near bland and doesn't have too much star anise, cinnamon, or whatever spice gives it a light sweet taste.\n\nDoan's might be under the radar for the general public, but apparently Vietnamese people know what's up.  It's always a good sign when there's a bunch of Vietnamese people in a Vietnamese restaurant, dontcha think?  They have options, but they choose to come here.  \n\nService Highlight - We got all of the limes that are table wanted.  Lime shortage?  Ain't nobody got time for that?  Certainly not Doan's.  They're not sheisty with their limes.  (Really?  A shortage of limes causing its price to spike?  It's a friggin' lime, but I digress.)\n\nI'm a fan.  Pho lovers, give this place a shot.\n\ndmo out.
