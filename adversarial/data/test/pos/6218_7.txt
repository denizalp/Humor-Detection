I order the spaghetti and meatball, and the Parmesan chicken.  It was very dry, and not a lot of sauce. In other words, there were more noodles than sauce. Due to using so much noodles, it made the meal appear larger than what was actually available. In addition, it came with a side salad and garlic bread.  The garlic bread was well done,and difficult to eat.  The salad had a huge chunk of iceberg lettuce that was not chopped done. I also purchase a burger for $6.  It was so small and not worth the money spent.  The taste wasn't too bad, just didn't get what I felt was worth the money I spent.  I really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't do it for me.
