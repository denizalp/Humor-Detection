Kind of tucked away, but a total gem. I am a big fan of tea and was so excited to try this place as soon as I heard about it. The interior decor is adorable, only downside was I could barely read the sign, though I'm sure I could have had assistance with this haha. My only other complaint was that it was small which would be fine except someone was hosting a huge meeting in there and there wasn't room for anyone else to sit inside. \nI got the ruze latte hot and my sister got a cold London fog, I don't remember what my mom got! But we were all happy with our choices. I haven't really had a tea latte before, but I liked it! This is a very cute place, thumbs up from me.
