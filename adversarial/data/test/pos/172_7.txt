This review is for the Casino: \n\nPH is very similar to it's neighbors.  It's in a really good location right in the middle of the strip and is really close to plenty of restaurants and shopping.  Burgr is extremely busy, so I missed out eating there twice.  Earl of Sandwich is a life saver.  \n\nOther than that, PH has plenty of ways to gamble and have a blast.
