Come-on people! Its deal time! and I am not talking about used car salesman, I've got a house in Florida, you can't imagine what this piece of art is going to be worth in ten years deal.... nooooooo, I mean a D E A L. \n\nLets talk about that word for a second. People throw the word \"deal\" around like its going out of style, but not moi. \"Deal\" is a very special word that can only be used within the following parameters: \n\n1. The product has to be something you actually want or need. 70% off Kurdish Yack Tongue does not a deal make. \n2. Its not a deal if I have to get in a long snaking line  with tweens, teens or eens of any kind, fill our forms or wait more than 15 seconds to receive it. \n\nGot that? ok, moving right along. If you want a deal head to Sunshine Cafe any weekday for lunch. Leave your friends and lovers and co-workers and baggage and just go, they will weigh you down and once the lunch comes you won't be talking to them anyway. So here it is:\n\nYou will drive up, exit the car left, enter the dive joint and order \"the special\". There is a large menu board, but just ignore it... I know its hard, all the pretty pictures and all but just say the words \"I'll have the special\" and get ready for a deal. What do you get?\n\n-a quarter of a jerk chicken, \n-rice and peas\n-home brew. could be mango or other fruit\n\nThe jerk is ....say whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? then you have another bite to see if it was a mistake.... say whaaaaaaatt??? you will keep repeating this with every bite. \n\nThe rice and peas are excellent and the home brew is... well... words just fall short.  \n\nAnd the deal? Its 2.99! Two Ninety Nine. That's right folks... you read correctly.  If you want... get two... its still a deal! Get three and take one home.... go crazy. ..... just go\n\nI'm done with this review. \n\ngo\n\n\nGO!
