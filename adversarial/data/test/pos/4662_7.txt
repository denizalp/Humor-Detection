The second half of a coffee crawl brought me to this place. Whether it was because of a coffee cleansing grilled cheese for lunch or the fact it was only the 5th stop or so, I have to rank this coffee with some of the best I have tried.\n\nOf course I had to try a coffee from the suckling of the renowned clover machine. With their X thousand dollar machine (I've heard a range of cost) my first experience could be no else. There are only about 3 or 4 different beans to choose from, they are all quite potent. When they grind up the beans they let you smell it. Luckily I had witnessed the process of obtaining a clover coffee and I knew what to do when they handed me a cup of ground coffee beans. I do like the smell of coffee and although I don't see the point of smelling it (since coffee smells like coffee to me), I did feel important. When the cup of joe arrived and took my first sip, my palette was satisfied.\n\nThis coffee shop is filled with your stereotypical hipster crowd, many people with their macbooks writing screenplays (one can only assume), and people with open textbooks and writing stuff like its a library. I don't fit into the coffee crowd culture here, but I do enjoy what they serve up.
