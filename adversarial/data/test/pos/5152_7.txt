So, I'm working on a few scrapbook projects, and decided it was time to work on some decor for the apartment.  I have some great photos I want to hang on my walls from recent trips, and instead of purchasing frames, I decided to get creative and make my own type frame with scrapbooking supplies.  I was in the market for chip board, which is a real heavy, thick book like material.  Its very sturdy and thick, and wanted to use this as the backdrop for my photos.\n\nFinding chipboard has been a bit of a pain in the butt.  I couldn't find it at any of the major retailers, and figured I had to go to a specialty store to get some.  That's fine, I go to the specialty stores anyways, so its not a problem.  Plus, all of them are small businesses, so I'm really killing two birds with one stone.  I get my supplies, and I'm supporting a small family run business.  Every one wins, right?\n\nI found scrap happy sisters on Yelp and gave them a shout today on the phone.  Its hot, and I wanted to make sure they had my supplies before I drive across town and waste my time.  When I called in, the lady was kinda rude and on the phone.  I asked her if she had chip board, and she was like \"yea.\" I asked her what sizes, and she told me.  I asked her what time they were open until, and she was like \"o, yea midnight since I'm having a class.\"  O, well excuse me for interrupting your day there princess hope things are getting better for you at the castle.  \n\nAnyways, the store itself is cute and has some great products.  Classrooom seems a bit tight, and was packed when I was there.  They must have been having some kind of all day scrap a thon going on, because there wasn't an empty seat to be found.  Prices seemed fine on supplies, but I would steer clear of their scrapbooks as they seemed a bit over priced.\n\nOverall, the store is okay, but the lady behind the counter is really not friendly and unhelpful. I literally had to beg her to help me, and so I deducted 2 stars. I might go back, but not quite sure yet.
