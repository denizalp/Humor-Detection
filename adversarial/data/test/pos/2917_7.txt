OMG. This place was excellent. The food was sooooo good. However, I reeked of garlic the next 2 days. REEKED! I could smell it on my fingers for crying out loud!\nNo bueno.\nThat was one of only 2 things I didn't like. The other....no cocktails, just beer.\nBut moving on........\n\nThe food was delicious. I mean, my crab legs were outstanding. I tasted my friends shrimp and WOW. I have really been put off by shrimp lately and it was just like my crablegs.....outstanding!!!!!\nI will absolutely be back.....just when I know I wont see people for at least 2 days!
