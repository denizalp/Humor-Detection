I brought my dog here once before and it was a good experience. Because of what happened today I won't be back. I had a 9am appointment and when I got there it already looked like they were overbooked and busy - my dog wasn't seen until 9:30. Not shocking, I know, seems to be the normal way any type of medical practice operates these days. \n\nThe effect of it though, was that Dr. Flannery was extremely short, rude and callous. He brought my dog back from getting her shot and immediately started spewing out how her \"teeth are funky\" her \"warts are gross\" so she needs to come back in for a \"dental\" and to have the warts removed. \n\nNo greeting, no hello, nothing (I hadn't seen him in over a year so we had no pre exisitng relationship) - just started spewing like a used car salesman. Then he referred to my dog as \"it.\" Not she, not he, but it. I interjected and said \"she's not an it, she's a she.\" And he slammed the clipboard down and said \"if you're going to attitude me, don't come back.\" \n\nI get that people get busy and stressed. I was stressed myself being in there. But there is NO EXCUSE for unprofessional, rude behaviour. Some may say I'm overly sensitive - and I admit I am sensitive to how I\"m treated, especially by other professionals. \n\nA simple \"hello\" from Dr. Flannery when he entered the room might have made all of this moot. I could have overlooked the unprofessional, callous way he presented the information because that might be his communication style. Which may have worked if only he were friendly or even courteous. No empathy, courtesy or kindness whatsoever. And, in the end, I got no useful information at all about what needs to happen for my dog. \n\nSo many businesses seem to take their clients for granted. As if we have no other choices. As if they can be rude to us and get angry when we call them out on it. This review would be 1 star except for the fact that the receptionist was kind and treated me with compassion and grace. She's the only one in there that did. I may only be one client but they've lost my business forever.
