I love Earl's!!! I normally don't crave sandwiches after a night of drinking and dancing, but Earl's is a different story. Earl's is open 24 hours, the sandwiches are relatively cheap, and they're delicious!! I usually get the Full Montagu, and I love that the sandwich is assembled first and THEN toasted to perfection. All the ingredients, even the vegetables still remain fresh. Writing this review just makes me want one now.  Yummmmmm.
