Nutrition Village is a tiny little health food store located inside the Yonge & Eglinton Centre on the first floor. They have a nice selection of vitamins, minerals, other supplements, bulk foods and more. I'm surprised how much they've been able to pack into their little space.\n\nI really like their cosmetic section. They have a ton of natural products from brands such as Jason, Derma E, Kiss my Face and more. They have products here that I have not seen in other places such as Noah's; the prices are way less too! The price for vitamins and other supplements are generally less compared to other health foods stores as well, but the bulk food is a bit pricey. They do not sell any produce.\n\nThe place is not too organized and it can take time to find what you're looking for. The staff here is not helpful and they don't offer any help. They seem to be pretty distracted with personal matters such as talking on the phone or blankly looking at the walls. You're pretty much on your own here.\n\nI'll come back here because they have most of my vitamins, other supplements and natural beauty products for less here. If you need any recommendation for health products, I would skip this place.
