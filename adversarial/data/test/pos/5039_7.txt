This hotel kicks ass. It's so new, modern, luxurious and affordable. Terrific service at check in, we all won money gambling, great restaurants, lounges\/club all in the hotel. Also right next to the Belagio and New Cosmo hotel. It took me and my 2 girlfriends like 15 minutes to figure out how to work the lights\/automated curtains\/video and audio, but hey... Girls and technology just DON'T mix!\nI loved this hotel, I am SO coming back here again next time I'm in town.
