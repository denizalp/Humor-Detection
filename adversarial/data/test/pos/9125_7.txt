I had tons of fun at trapped.  I've heard about the escape room craze, but had never tried it.  Trapped is at a pretty convenient location downtown - so it was perfect!\n\nWe did Pandemic and I'm not going to lie, I had no idea what to expect.  I thought zombies were going to jump out at us (thankfully no real zombies).  The escape room was really well put together and there was a lot of attention to detail to some of the props.  Two of our group were under 18 and we found the difficulty level was perfect, with some of the clues being really intuitive.  You get three hints and we were at the time limit, but so close to solving and they allowed us a few more minutes to figure it out!\n\nI think I'm officially on the escape room bandwagon.
