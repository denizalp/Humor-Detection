So a childhood friend got married in Vegas...I drove out out Sat night, and drove back Sunday morning...This is where they had the reception...so obviously I am a big tiki-o-phile and therefore was super excited to come here. It didn't disappoint. Its straight in China town and is next door to a Korean BBQ restaurant...so don't let that throw u when you are looking for it. \n\nThe interior is awesome, and I would describe it but I want you to experinece it for yourself.\n\nDrinkwise I got a Banana coconut batida which was lovely. Got a mai tai that was good not great. We had a special drink made for our wedding party and that was great. They have several signature mugs that you can purchase and they were cool - I bought 2. A cool thing was you can have them make any drink in any mug you want. \n\nAwesome off strip spot, will def come back everytime I am in Vegas.
