Awesome place with an awesome atmosphere, awesome staff and awesome classes! Okay, that's enough awesomes, but you get the picture! Ha, see what I did there?!\n\nLast night, I went with a date and it was an extraordinary experience. From beginning to end, it was just around crazy cool. My partner bought us two spots to paint Van Gough's Almond Blossoms. It was super easy, well, if you aren't trying to be perfect.\n\nAfter two hours, I was satisfied with my experience. They had great music playing, a good selection of wine for purchase and an available staff to aide at any moment. Seriously? \n\nPaint. Wine. Have fun! Best motto ever.\n\nIf you're looking for a date night activity, choose this place. I was a beginner and had a terrific experience. Oh, and bring something you don't mind getting dirty just in case! \n\nWhen you're finished with your painting, you get to take the canvas home and it's a great memento.\n\nFive stars. Hands down. I can't wait to check out another class!!
