Whiskey Warehouse - your service sucks and I could get better pimento cheese dip at the HT across the street.  I was here last Thursday and at 11pm a snottty manager-type lady came over and asked us to cash out because she wanted to leave for the night.  WHAT??  How can you be rude and come over so early?!  I looked at my watch and thought geeez time must have gotten away from us but no - it was only 11.  Are you kidding?  Can yall get with it?
