It's under construction yes. Did you get it free or cheap? Yes. Did you know you were getting it for dirt cheap. I'm guessing you did. Then it's safe to say that all your boxes were checked.  This hotel serves its purpose. Place to crash. Centrally located. New design. Near the hockey arena. If you need some selfies to pretend you spent loads of money on a room the Aria is a 5 minutes walk away. Check in is automated. And it will work, just fool around with it. Once you learn how the reader will scan your ID, you'll never have a problem again. And also all the self check ins are in all the MGM properties in Vegas so you will become a pro and never need assistance again. If you need to upgrade your room or what not ....call a head and talk to the VIP host and they will definitely hook you up before check in. \n\nAnyways hotel is exactly what I wanted in Vegas ! #wasnottemptedwithabuffet
