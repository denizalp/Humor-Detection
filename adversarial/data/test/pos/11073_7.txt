Smells good in here!\n\nSo, I came here to celebrate Cathy's birthday.  Well, one of the many days she's celebrating it.  I live on the complete opposite side of town, but it was well worth the trip.  I don't know how to gauge distance to time in Vegas.  Needlessly to say, I was early.  But, that's okay, I don't mind being early.\n\nThe 8 of us were seated in the back room.  Good move as the language can get a little \"Salty\".  Especially after the all you can drink margaritas and mimosas kick in.  I took advantage of that aspect of the buffet.  Which, by the way, was $13.95, with the drinks included.\n\nThe food was good, for the buffet.  I had a huge plate, then focused my attention on the bottomless margaritas.  Our waiter was great and on the ball.  The highlight was the singing of Happy Birthday and Kathy wearing a sombrero.  \n\nI think we were there for 3 hours just drinking and cracking wise.  I would make the drive again to hang out with this group.  Good times were had!
