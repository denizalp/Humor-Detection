Stayed here on a recent trip to Las Vegas. I loved that the hotel is near other hotels I wanted to venture into - Venetian, Palazzo, etc. Got a great deal through Priceline.\n\nThe rooms are well appointed, the bathroom clean, however, the rug that led to the room was dirty. Looked like someone poured some dark liquid or something and no one has gotten around to cleaning it.The front desk was pretty friendly even though I didn't book through them directly. Ivy at the concierge area booked my shuttle for me and was a wealth of other local information that you would not find on any guide.\n\nI left my luggage at the bell desk since I had a couple of hours between shuttle pick up and when I checked out. I thought it was a great service until I ran across this bell desk agent that was more into getting a tip from me. He hadn't even taken my luggage and he was already telling me he would take care of my luggage with his hand motioning for money. He repeated himself that he would take care of my luggage but he didn't think that he would be there in 2 hours when I returned and then motioned again for money. Such a turn off! When I told him I didn't have any change on me (which was true - I was not about to fork over a $20), he told me he would give me change. This is just poor taste! \n\nI would stay here again but steer clear of this guy at the bell desk.\n\nBTW - Fashion Show Mall is right across the street too!
