We are sick and tired of this location mainly because of the doctor.  The doctor that we have seen the last two times is an old grumpy doctor.  My wife took our son in on Saturday, August 17th, 2013 at about 4PM because he has been having cold like symptoms for like 5 days and nothing was helping so we suspected an ear infection. The stupid doctor says why didn't you take your son to his pediatrican? Umm, hello, its Saturday 4PM and the office is not open hence the reason why we are here at Urgent Care and then just because my son was chewing some M&M's the doctor said how I am supposed to examine him?  Well, sheesh, I didn't study to be a doctor or anything but you wait until the boy is done chewing his M&M's and then you proceed with the examination.  The doctor is an old man, he is grumpy and I don't know if he is bitter because he should be retired and doesn't want to work but you don't treat patients like that and for that reason this Urgent Care Extra location has lost our business and we will happily take our business elsewhere.
