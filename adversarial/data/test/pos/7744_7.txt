I've visited Fontaine many times to look at fabric, but I won't be going back. My sister and I went to the store today, to look at upholstery samples, and the owner was very rude and patronizing. He told us we couldn't look at fabric because Fontaine was having its holiday open house. (There were very few people in the store, and no one in the fabric section.) After my sister mentioned that she'd driven across town, the owner relented and then flounced off. Um, hello? This is Madison, dude, not whatever city you wish you lived in. My sister and I are both re-upholstering a lot of furniture, and plan to spend several thousand dollars on fabric, easy. We'll be taking or business elsewhere, like to Zander's, on Monroe Street. They're, you know, nice.
