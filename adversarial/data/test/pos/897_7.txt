I may get a little insulting with this one, so all you five star raters, clench your butt cheeks.\n\nThis place made me hate everything that sushi has become. A posh dining room with third rate service and food. For the first time in my life I sent a sushi roll back. They actually dared to serve a mango salmon roll with still green mango that was so unripe, i lacked the drape over the sushi roll.\n\nThere is so much wrong with this place that it made me question my taste for raw fish. In Vegas where good food is always a stones throw away, I recommending directing those stones towards this restaurant.
