Despite the fact that this bar is getting one star, you should go there and soon. \n\nMostly because it won't be open long. \n\nFriend won a \"VIP\" party! Yay, let's go!\nTurns out that means four dollar domestic drafts and two dollars off well drinks.... Wow. Lookout, we got a crazy night coming! \n\nThey seat us in the corner, and the six of us order a drink. We practiced conversing for about 25 minutes before 4 beers and two drinks arrived, 66% accuracy rate. Nothing really improved after this. Lame waitress was incredibly slow to bring drinks and take orders. It was lame. Especially when it was not too busy in the bar. \n\nA bouncer type guy brought us two of our drinks after we asked him to get us our waitress. \n\nAfter we decided to move on, it took them over 15 minutes to bring our cards back. WTF. \n\nIf you like being ignored and crunching ice with your teeth instead of drinking the beer you ordered, this is your new spot. Hurry while the horrible service has that new bar smell!
