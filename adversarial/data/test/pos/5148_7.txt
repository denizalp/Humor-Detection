I cannot say enough nice (and true!) things about M3 Remodeling, but I'll try and do them justice. \n\nFirstly, they are a team of highly skilled artisan-quality contractors. I had a very complicated tile pattern selected for my bathroom and it matches perfectly at every seam. M3 even compensated for the fact that the wall wasn't perfectly straight and made it look as if it was. \n\nSecondly, they are very reasonable and extremely hard working. The last few days, even though they were not behind schedule, they worked long hours, drenched in sweat from the fact that our AC needed replacing. They did not complain (or I think really even notice); they were just focused on getting the job done and getting it done to perfection, which they did. The bathroom looks amazing and we could not be more pleased.\n\nM3 is also a company made up of professional, kind, caring and generous individuals. We never for one moment felt uncomfortable having them at the house or felt like we needed to check in with them to make sure things were being done correctly. On the contrary, it was always nice to have them around because of their wonderfully kind and gentle demeanor. They are just wonderful people and we are looking forward to having them remodel our second bathroom. \n\nI cannot recommend MC Remodeling highly enough. They are an excellent company in every way possible: professional, kind, courteous, highly skilled in their profession, have a strong work ethic and are very reasonable! Who could ask for more?
