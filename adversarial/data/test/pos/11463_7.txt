Good ol' Zodie's. When the smoking ban went into effect, this bar ditched their kitchen and mounted a GIANT sign with bold, red print, exclaiming, \"SMOKERS WELCOME.\" I admit, the ban is probably a good idea. I will cover that statement with, \"To each his own,\" everyone's opinion counts, etc. etc. etc. But I do admire the zeal with which they stood to their cause. Now, the decor in Zodie's didn't click in my gourd until very recently. Why? I don't know, because now that I get it, it's just so apparent. The place is scattered with zodiac symbols, sun catchers, and wind chimes. The lighting changes, too, depending on who's on shift. If it's Jim or Pete, the lights are at their fullest level. But if Charla is working, she'll turn the lights completely off, fill the joint with candle light, and talk to you about where your sun is and which planet is in your ... I can't ever follow, but it sure sounds nice. Everyone likes a scapegoat when their luck has run dry, yeah? I've also heard several accounts of the haunt who hangs out at Zodie's, which just adds to the place's appeal. For goofs like me, anyway. I guess he wears a white T shirt, and likes to play with the TVs and radio. I've never witnessed this, but I keep hoping.\n\nThe drinks are good 'n strong. The prices are definitely affordable. I did, however, cringe a little when I selected the \"Night Life\" category, because every time we've been to Zodie's, the only other people at the bar are other employees. They do have a Golden Tee machine, and if you take a chance to get to know the bartenders, their stories can certainly be entertaining.\n\nIt may not be for everyone, but this is one of my favorite places to go for a cocktail.
