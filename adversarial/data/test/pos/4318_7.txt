This place is the jizz.\n\nFor a nominal fee you can check out some of the coolest sharks. You even get a handheld soundtrack to better explain things.\n\nGreat way to pass time during the day while you're recovering and preparing for the night's debauchery. When we went it wasn't all that crowded so we were able to see things without having to dodge the whales that don't reside behind the glass.\n\nA must see for all!!
