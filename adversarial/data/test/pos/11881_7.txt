Food is ok, service is horrible.  I had stuffed crepes with asparagus and ham topped with hollandaise sauce, potatoes on the side.  Crepes were good. Potatoes were dry. Ron had short stack of pancakes, sausage patties and scramble eggs. It was fine.  We had a hard time getting coffee, silverware, butter and water.  In fact we never got water, they were too busy. Table behind us couldn't get napkins.  If you happen to stop at the Tap, make sure it's a slow day for them.
