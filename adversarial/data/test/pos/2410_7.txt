I have to give HUMAN NATURE and their show five stars even though the show venue is one star.  Since that's not HN's fault, that's why I'll give them five stars.\n\nWhat needs to go is the Imperial Palace.  What a ducking fump this place is.   Yeah, I know, there's a wall along one side they're remodeling because of the looming Linq project.  Still, that's NO EXCUSE for the condition of the remainder of the casino.  Dumpy casinos on Freemont are better looking than this abandoned Home Depot warehouse with delusions of grandeur.\n\nAnd you'd think that if a show as solid as HUMAN NATURE was on a second story of this toilet there'd be a GIANT VEGAS SIZED SIGN by the CRITICAL escalator.  Nope.  Like everything at the IP they apparently don't give a damn.   This place is one of the few hotels on the strip that not only should be imploded... but I'd gladly contribute my resort fee to make it happen.\n\nSo, once you find the mysterious escalator path to the showroom, it's as pathetic as showroom spaces go.  The tables and chairs mostly look worn and rented.  You fear you've been screwed.  The lights finally dim (allowing you to imagine you're in a nice theater) and MOTOWN MUSIC starts.  \n\nNot live music, mind you.  A recording.  Hello.... that's STUPID.  Just start the show.  Nope.  Two entire songs this way.  Then a screen drops and Smokey Robinson starts talking to you.  About how amazing his Aussie boys HUMAN NATURE are.  Again, I'm like, look, just open with these 'amazing' men and I'm sure if they're at all impressive we'll be impressed as well and the freakin' show can begin before the Imperial Palace collapses under it's junk food weight.\n\nFinally the 'boys' hit the stage and WHAMMO you know in under one minute the ticket prices were a steal.  Even if you payed full price.  It doesn't matter.  They're AMAZING.  And you wonder what purpose the long intro served.  If HUMAN NATURE wants to pad the show to make it feel longer, replace this strange intro with the band warming us up with two Motown songs.  \n\nUnderstand:  I'm not the biggest Motown fan.  Seriously.  I was a baby during the critical years.  But that really doesn't matter once you hear these guys sing and watch them dance.  I'll be frank and admit that sometimes I wanted them to be four black dudes who could PERFECTLY mimic Motown.  That said, if you had to hire four white dudes to do Motown, this was the best 'Jersey Boys' group you'd find.\n\nAs much fun as this was for me and my parents, a few picky notes.  One, this group wants you to understand that they're as big as ABBA down under.  Since none of us in the US have ever heard of them -- we don't really care.  But all night long they keep trying to make you 'get' that these guys are really big somewhere else.  I'm not even sure if it's true but -- again -- WE DON'T CARE.    (If you're so frickin' big over there, how it is that they can spare you for years over here singing MOTOWN?  Doesn't add up, does it?)  So please shut up about this and just nail MOTOWN the powerful way you do the things you do.\n\nSecondly, the band name HUMAN NATURE might as well be DAISY PAPAYA.  It doesn't work.  It makes the show impossible to recommend to others.  I tried.  Y'all need some name like MOTOWN UNDER.  It explains what and where from in two words.  Or in Vegas you might take the band's weakest aspect and make it your strength;  FOUR WHITE GUYS SINGING MOTOWN.  Whatever.  Anything but HUMAN NATURE.\n\nThese three things (location, band name, prior band history) obscure an otherwise phenomenal group.  Their band is hot, their moves are perfect, their song choice and sequence solid, their energy limitless, their repartee kinda corny but kinda charming too.  This is the only band in a long time I've seen successfully manage to get the audience up and dancing.  We shaked the cardboard underpinnings of the Imperial Palace.  I was literally bouncing up and down on this second story showroom like a kid in an air castle.\n\nAt the end of the show there was a line to meet the boys.  I had to run so I snuck up to one and said, \"What the hell are you guys doing here?  You belong across the street in the Terry Fator theater at the Mirage.\"  He was so humble he appeared flattered.  Class act.\n\nSo as long as you're willing to see a reasonably priced show inside a NYC subway station restroom, you're going to have a really great time.
