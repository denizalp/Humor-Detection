Not that I'm an avid Matthews goer, but.....FINALLY! A place to score some local draught (and select bottles) of local\/craft beer in the area. Bottle shops seem to be popping up around Crown Town as of late and I say the more the merrier. Spreading the love of a good brewskie is just what the doctor ordered.....for everywhere. Glad to see Carolina Beer Temple on the scene and doing things rather well. \n\nThe interior is rather cozy. Plenty of cushy seats, giant stools for the bar, \"temple-y\" decor, and some of the cleanest shelving\/stocking I've seen to date. Move aside, Total Wine. I love the giant throne that they have along the far wall. Makes me feel like a king or something. \n\nThe owners are cool dudes with an equally cool and dude-ish story. Get to know them. They're great to chat with. \n\nLocal draughts abound -- Four Friends, NoDa, Birdsong, OMB, etc. Hopefully some Free Range and Ass Clown beers will make their way down their way, too. \n\nExcited to see these guys grow and keep the beer flowing for the Matthews area!
