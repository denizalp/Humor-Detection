The best island food on lakeshore. It's outstanding. Never bad. I'm always satisfied.\n\nThe decor of the place is insane, and cluttered, with odd political messages on the wall. The decor is awful but who cares. The staff are friendly enough (it's just the family that owns the place). All of this however is unimportant.\n\nThe reason why none of that matters is because the Roti is so good. Standard potato, jerk chicken, shrimp, you can't go wrong. My personal favorite is the jerk chicken. It's delicious. I'd probably kill a man for one of these Roti if I were hungry enough.\n\nDon't be deterred by the exterior appearance, really excellent food inside. Give it a try especially if you love Caribbean\/island food.
