Fucking GREAT pizza!  This place rivals Cibo for my favorite pizza in town.  I had a cheese and peperoni pie.  The peperoni was spicy but not over riding so. That sauce was very fruity, the crust perfectly crispy yet soft and flexible.   Wow.\n\nThe restaurant is very small and tucked into a dirty little strip mall but the inside is nice.  \n\nIf you love pizza I think you'll LOVE this place.  YUM!
