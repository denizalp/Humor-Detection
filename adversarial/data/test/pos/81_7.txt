I received a massage from Touch of Healing as a Xmas present. I decided to use it last week and I am glad that I didn't pay for it myself. My massage therapist Thomas had ice cold hands for about half of the massage. It was very hard to relax due to this. Also during the last half of my massage I heard a big thud on the door which startled me and someone pushing paper under the door. That took me out of the relaxed state that I just got into. I then heard my door open and the massage therapist pull keys out of his pocket and give them to someone. It was the most unrelaxed massage I have received.  :-(\n\nUPDATE: I received an email from Thomas offering me a free 30 minute massage BUT I could upgrade to an hour for $25.... I don't think so. The email seemed pretty unprofessional and he added that him disrupting the massage was for the best. This email was a little creepy at parts and unprofessional to say the least.
