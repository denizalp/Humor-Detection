The five stars is for the meats, all of them, and the awesome service and people that run this establishment. I have tried the brisket, chicken, beef ribs and sausage. All great. The brisket is super tender and just falls apart, which isn't typical for brisket in my experience, but this is delicious. Flavors are all great.\n\nThe sides are eh. I had beans that weren't cooked through all the way and the grits were just ok. I would say just come for the meat. \n\nIf you have a group that doesn't mind eating around 11-11:30, call in your order a few days in advance and you can pick it up before 11am. This way you don't have to wait in line and you can make your own sides.
