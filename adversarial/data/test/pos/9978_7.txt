Updating because we went back just for the games, as I certainly would never put myself through the bizarre and gross experience of dining with them again. \n\nIt was a half price Wednesday, so it was busy. We waited in line to get our play card and use our coupon. The guy at the counter looked at me like I had two heads when i showed him the coupon on my phone. He took my phone from me and kept it behind the counter for the entire transaction, even when he was done with it, which I found odd. He also made sure to touch me with his creepily long fingernails as much as possible throughout our transaction, which was more often than you'd think. \n\nHe couldn't figure out how to use the coupon, he also couldn't figure out how to ask anyone for help. \n\nWednesdays are cheaper but also super busy, and we had to wait for most games we wanted to play.\n\nOrdered a couple beers from the small bar on the game floor, and the bartender was unfriendly and kind of a douche, so that was fun.\n\nI mean, this place is absolutely no better than gameworks.\n\nIts also deafeningly, ear bleeding loud in there so its hard to carry on a conversation.\n\nUggggggh Dave and busters, you could have been so awesome, but right now you aren't even mediocre. Management clearly doesn't read the reviews, or if they do, they don't care.
