I'm giving 5 stars for 2 reasons:\n1) the 3 stars another reviewer bequeathed needs to be evened out (IF you don't like shopping in Ali Baba's cave, or Junque stores in general - NO - YOU WILL NOT LIKE SHOPPING HERE) \n2)  It is not shopping- it's a SPECTACLE. And, because it's an amazing thing to be greeted by a sprightly nymph ecstatically offering  you little cups of steaming cider on a frigid day (ESPECIALLY in Montreal where even good service is \"nice\" but not enthusiastic). GREAT music.\nThat all said:\nNo the selection is not vast.\nYes, the changing rooms are Laugable.\nYes, you Can find treasure. (green wool tweed 3 button jacket in perfect condition= 20$. Black \"free people\" leggings= $3)\n\nAnecdotally, we brought the parents here and my 79 year old father in law was stoked to sit on the back couch with the dog, drink coffee & listen to Little Richard. My 74 year old mom wanted to move in.\nThe Swimming Pool of clothes is No More. :( \nHowever:\nDO NOT MISS THE BATHROOM.\nOR THE FREE POPCORN.\nOR THE CAFE. you get a cup of delightful cocoa served on a tray with \"add your own sweetness\" sugar on the side= Who Are These People? Genius.\n\nAltogether, as good a tourist spot as the Basilica. And more charming. I will upload the photos later.
