If you are looking for an upscale French decor pretentious atmosphere then you've come to the right place. I came here two weeks ago with my cousin, and well, we did not have a good time, especially since I had very high expectations. I never felt so out of place before in my life, and I've been to a few upscale high end restaurants. Apparently, you have to dress up a lot or else you get weird looks from the waiters and staff. \n\nThe interior: The decor is very elegant, classy, and French themed. They have an amazing seating area, lounge\/bar area, and the interior are designed very well. There are lots of random paintings, portraits, and photos on the wall, which is nice to look at. The colour theme and music are very pleasant. Overall, it's definitely a beautiful place, and very picture worthy. \n\nThe food: We ordered from the dinner menu, and we were only here for appetizers and dessert. We ordered the veal tartare, goat cheese souffle, mozzarella, macaroons, profiteroles, and smores croissant. The veal tartare was okay, although I felt like the dijon was a bit over powering. The goat cheese souffle was horrible, super bitter, and we had to return it. Mozzarella pretty good, nothing extraordinary. The macaroons were horrible! For a French inspired restaurant, they do need to work on their macaroons, it was very dry and flaky, and you couldn't taste the different flavours. I will say the best dessert I ever had was the Profiteroles with vanilla ice cream with caramel cream and warm chocolate sauce, it was extremely good (even though it's off menu, you have to ask for it now). The smores croissant was delicious as well, and basically was everything you wanted out of a smores croissant. The presentation of each of the food dishes were pretty, and the portion sizes were small, however keep in mind this is a French inspired place. \n\nThe service: It was the most dissatisfying of my entire experience. Our server had a friendly condescending manner, and I'm not sure if that was on purpose to go along with the French atmosphere (joke) or that was his personality. When we ordered the goat cheese souffle, and told the server how unsatisfied we were, he immediately changed it for another app, and it was not counted towards for final bill, and yes that was very generous of him, however it came with a snobby remark, \"Well girls, at least you have a picture of instagram so it can look like you actually ordered two dishes,\" that was very insulting and embarrassing nonetheless. Yes, Colette is a beautiful place and so what if we enjoy taking pictures of our food, and the restaurant. I had to actually explain, that I review restaurants on yelp a lot, and I like to share my photos on yelp\/instagram. We live in the digital age, where we want to share all our experiences with the world. We did not ask for it to be taken off our bill, and we have sufficient money to pay for our food. It felt as if, the waiter kept questioning our ability to pay for our food, which was ridiculous. At one point, the server asked us what we do for a living, which I don't think is appropriate for a restaurant setting. It was a very humiliating experience, nonetheless I left a very generous tip for the server, not that I had anything to prove but because I have the ability to do so. \n\nOverall: Basically, don't come here undressed because the staff and other customers will look down at you. The food is alright, nothing special, and I don't know what the hype was all about anymore. I wouldn't recommend this place if you don't want to be judged based on your appearance, and have people question your capability to purchase dinner or humiliate you. One of the worst experiences of my life, and I would never come back here ever again.
