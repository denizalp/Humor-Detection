Let me start by saying that I've stayed at some of the most expensive hotels in Vegas and some of the cheapest. The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, The Hilton Grand, The Mirage- all have had my company at some point in time. With that being said, for the price, Circus Circus knows what they're doing. With a Groupon deal I got a room here with 1 queen bed for $25 a night. Yes- a hotel room, on the Vegas strip, for $25 a night. That is ridiculously cheap. Was the room fantastic? No. It's a little worn down, but the sheets were clean, the staff was friendly, and all of the basic amenities (a television, complimentary toiletries, and clean towels) were a part of the package. They're comparable to a well-kept Holiday Inn or Best Western in their room accommodations. For the price, it's absolutely worth it- and a great option for large families and groups on a budget. \n\nThe Circus Circus is by far one of the most family friendly hotels on the strip. They have something for everyone. From 6-year-olds to 60-year-olds and everyone in between- they attempt to meet your needs. The hotel has a casino, circus shows, an arcade \/ fair games for kids (and kids by heart!), bars, restaurants, a pool, and an amusement park. \n\nIf you have children, I honestly believe Circus Circus is the best place to stay. If your kids and responsible and independent (and old enough to handle being on their own) you can easily let them roam the 'circus' area while you are downstairs in the casino. The 'Circus' area features arcade games, fair games (with live people running the games), and live circus acts. Kids can earn prizes at the games or they can earn tickets that they can cash out for prizes at counters around the area. The casino is right downstairs and easily accessible- so you can check up on your kiddos, or they can find you with ease if they need to.\n\nThe casino is average; nothing special, but it will keep you busy for a while. We're not into gambling so we didn't spend a lot of time at the casino and unfortunately I can't give you a good idea of what it's like. Back to the kiddos though- there is a pool here! It can be a bit of a pain to find and isn't really conveniently located within the hotel. But, once found the pool is decent. It's comparable to other Vegas pools and is clean and well-kept. Because this is a kid-targeted hotel, the pool does tend to get really busy. Get there early to get enough lounge-seating if you have a group over 4 people. \n\nEating options here, again, are very kid friendly. Most famously is the Circus Buffet which offers up almost anything your heart could desire (and even the pickiest of kids will be able to find something to fit their fancy). There is also a deli, Mexican restaurant, pizzareria, burger joint, ice cream shop, McDonalds, and a few other quick eats. For adults there is a Starbucks and a steakhouse. \n\nThe hotel is located on the side of the strip, but it's walking distance from every other major hotel and attraction in downtown Vegas. You could easily walk to the Mirage volcano, Bellagio fountains, shopping centers, resorts, and entertainment and eating options. Cab fairs get a bit expensive around the strip- but if you opt for Uber it's often under $6 to go from one side of the strip to the other. \n\nOverall, I only stayed here a couple nights. It's not a place to go if you want to treat yourself- but if you're on a budget, have a big family, or want to delight your kids, Circus Circus is one of the best options out there in Vegas. A solid 4 star rating, I believe, is well-earned from me.
