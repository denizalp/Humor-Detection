Not my favorite Italian restaurant. \nIt's a very loud place and I felt was too busy for me to even pay attention to one thing. There was too much going on that day. There was wedding parties, big families, birthdays, and so on. \nI was on a date and felt that it was way too loud and crazy for a nice \"getting to know each other\" type of date. So, I'd avoid this place if that's what you're going for. \n\nThe ambiance was everywhere. Reminded me of an Italian version of TGIF. Yanno, random things on the wall and every waiter and waitress running around everywhere. Also, singing the happy birthday song to every table.\n\nAs for the food.... the waitress suggested we should order carefully as the food are all family style large portions. There's 2 girls on a date with one another, we weren't going to eat that much. I'm not a fan that they were all large portions though. I wanted to try other things on the menu, but I wasn't going to order it if they're all family portions. SO, we ordered the lasagna and some garlic bread. \n\nIt was a HUGE portion! There was a lot of garlic bread too! The food tasted a little bland for my liking. I felt the sauce wasn't giving me anything. I had to put a lot of parmesan on it to taste anything. The garlic bread wasn't too bad though. I liked it. At the end, we both didn't even finish our food. We took it to go. All in all, the experience was only well worth it because the waitress was very kind and always checked on us. Food wise, eh. So-so.
