Bok bok, who's there? Bok Bok Chicken recently opened, serving up fresh-grilled rotisserie chicken and healthy Mediterranean meals. The local chain is family owned and aims to open 4 more spots in quick succession, and if opening of the first shop is any indication, they'll be \"chicken\" butt and taking names soon.\n\nThe rotisserie chicken is by far my favorite meal here so far- juicy, tender, delicious, and sided with an incredible toom (garlic) sauce. As other reviews point out, this certainly isn't the only chicken shop around, but I like the menu here overall. Meals are sided with hummus, mutabbel (think babaghanoush), tabouli salad, house-made pickled turnips (with a nice kick of horseradish!), and a great, moist, long-grain rice that I really liked. Their stuffed grape leaves and lentil soup are also really good.\n\nI do wish their pita bread were a bit thicker, as a recent beef shawarma wrap totally fell apart. I have not yet tried their falafel or desserts, but I will be back soon to do so!
