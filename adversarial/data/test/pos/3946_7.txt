One thing I miss as an East Coast transplant is a good fish fry.  Went there today with Jacqui and Dave.  Service was quick and friendly, but not overly so.\nThe fish fry was perfect!  Not too much batter on the fish and it was perfectly crisp.  If you've ever had fried fish with so much batter that it doesn't all get cooked and you're left with soggy batter then you know what I'm talking about.\nRegular steak fries.  Great atmosphere.\nOH and they do comedy on Mondays.  I'll be performing Monday November 9th :}
