After the weekend Kevin the manager contacted me and apologized for what happened. He researched and found the reason that my car wasn't running correctly. I brought it back to them and they fixed the problem. I'm only giving four stars due to the amount of stress I endured through this process, but the bottom line is they made it right. I only wish I would have dealt with Kevin from the start. He's a solid dude, even if he is a bronco fan!
