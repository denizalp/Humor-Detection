I am sure they should close down as a restaurant deli and open up as a PR shop. Seriously, this deli has better skills at landing itself in the news and getting free advertising than delivering good food. The chicken is the most tasteless chicken since Mandarin. Their so-called famous deli smoked meat sandwiches would be banished to a street cart if this were Montreal. Service was really friendly and not rushed with a personality though. Overall though food-wise Shame. Seriously.
