This review is for NEW YEARS EVE ONLY!!\n!. My girlfriend and I had an 8:30 reservation and when we arrived there was a line out in front of the door. They were NOT ready for the 2nd seating and took almost 20 minutes to finally start getting everyone in and to their tables. \n2. I ordered a very EXPENSIVE bottle of champagne and you would have thought the waiter would have taken care of us, but he pretty much ignored us. After he poured our champagne, he placed the champagne on the piano where ANYONE could have just poured themselves champagne from OUR BOTTLE. I had to ask him to get an ice bucket and move it NEXT to our table!!\n3. The waiter took our order for appetizers  which was about 6 different options and he would bring them to us with sauces. He brought back our \"order\" but had lobster claws and only a couple of stone crab claws. I asked for what we ordered and he went back to get more. He came back with only 4 and said this was ALL they had they were out. OUT after only 30 minutes into service!!??\n4. We ordered a Caesar Salad for 2 and when they brought it we tried it and you could tell it was pre prepared as the lettuce was soggy and the salad was over dressed!\n5 Dinner came and at least our steaks came out great.\n6. The waiter brought us dessert (no choice on this huh?) and they were from a crappy pre prepared bakery complete with the paper on the bottom of both desserts. Both un edible. \n7. This was by reservation ONLY, so for you to be so totally UNPREPARED on service, food etc is inexcusable!! For the prices you charge, you should be ashamed!\n8. I have traveled around the world to some of the finest restaurants in major European cities and they know how to take care of their customers where you want to come back. Dominick's is arrogant and thinks they are the be all, end all. Guess what, you're NOT all that!! Restaurants are driven by customers and how you treat your customers will determine how well you will do. Unless you FIX your problems, not only will you fail for next New Years, but I can't see you being in business for long. In this economy restaurants are NOT a necessity and people will go where they are taken care of, as well as for the food. You're NOT cutting it with your customer service and for your sake, you need to take a good long look at how you're mistreating customers and change it. If not, you'll be another asterisk of \"and this was where Dominick's USED to be!!\"
