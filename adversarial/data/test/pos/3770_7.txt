Ohhhhh, the Three Palms Resort.  How, oh how, our relationship is so bittersweet.\n\nThe first time I stayed in this hotel was for my friend's bachelorette party in April of this year.  We decided to get the 2 queen suite because it was cheap and provided ample room for all the ladies to stay in.  When we got there and checked in, we couldn't find parking anywhere.  We had to park far away from our room.  Whatever.  \n\nRoom:  The room was awesome!!!  We had almost a mini-kitchen in our suite and a fridge that held PLENTY of liquor!!!  The fridge is about 4 feet tall.  The decor is modern, yet extremely retro, with hues of poop brown, burnt orange, puke green...you get the point, but I LOVED it!  The bedding is VERY comfortable.  There were 2 bathrooms in our suite, 2 tv's, all the works.  We had a room facing the pool, which was nice.\n\nLocation:  The location for this hotel is amazing.  You are centrally located to many nearby attractions in Old Town Scottsdale and cab rides are cheap as hell to anywhere around that area.  Try the divey sports bar across the park...can't remember the name of it, but drinks are CHEAP.\n\nStaff: This is where my rating goes bad.  The first time we got this room we had a male dancer come for my friend.  He arrived in his fire fighter gear (people must have saw him when he was by our room in front of the pool with his boom-box).  With a bundle of ladies, and only around 9 pm, our man went to work.  15 minutes in to serving his customers (us) we got a knock on the door.  It was security telling us we were being TOO LOUD and that we needed to turn it down.  WHATEV.  So, the man kept at it, and another 10 minutes later we had another knock at the door.  This time, we were being too loud AND apparently we didn't have the blinds closed all the way and people at the pool could see the action.  So, we closed the blinds, turned down the music, and went back at it.  The THIRD time we had a COP at our door.  WTH?!  It was not even 10 pm yet and we were already about to get the boot from this place.\n\nIT DOES NOT STOP HERE!\n\nThe second time I stayed in this place, I once again got a suite.  This one had a jacuzzi in it.  My friends and I got back to our room at about 1 am, and not even 3 minutes after we got in we had a knock at the door.  Low and behold it was security telling us we were being TOO LOUD!  I said we JUST got in to the room.  He then tried to accuse us of parking in front of the fire pole and told us to move, except it was not our vehicle!\n\nAfter the second time of getting interupted, I decided to write a review on their website about my experience.  Needless to say I have not heard back about my stays.  I am a paying customer and pay to stay in a hotel to go have fun, drink, and party, especially when I stay in a suite.\n\nBe forewarned on your experience.  I will go back because the location is good, the price is cheap, and the room itself is awesome, but the security and hotel staff suck.
