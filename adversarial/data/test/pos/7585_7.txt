Blackbird Fly is located in the new Pinecrest development in Orange. It's a beautifully laid out store located right on the main drag of Pinecrest with parking spots out front.\n\nI have to be honest. I tend not to shop at many women's boutiques because I never feel the clothes are inclusive. I'm not a 5 foot tall size 0 looking for a $200 crop top, which is almost always what the inventory feels like. I nearly passed out when I came across sweaters and tunics that were sized to fit real people and ended up purchasing a flattering geometric knit sweater with a cute hood that I can't wait to wear (if it ever becomes fall). I love that the clothes here are real.\n\nThey have a lovely selection of jewelry, homewares, cards, small gifts and other stationary that were unique and simply darling. It was too tempting to buy 1000 things for myself. I will absolutely return here the next time I need a gift for someone! But don't get me wrong, I did purchase an amethyst chunk bracelet I have zero regrets about. :)\n\nAs I was checking out, I met the owner, who was lovely. I also really appreciated that while I was shopping, no one followed me around asking me if I liked XYZ. That's a pushy sales technique that just leaves me not wanting to return, and I'm so happy they don't do that. Love!
