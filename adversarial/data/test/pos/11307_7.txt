I made an appt with this salon but unfortunately had to cancel an hour before the appt time due to complications from a back injury I sustained in a car accident. I received an email stating that in order to make a new appointment I would have to pay for the services that would have been rendered in order to even make a new appointment. If this is how they choose to treat injured patrons, then I will take my business elsewhere.
