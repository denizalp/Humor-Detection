This is a Chinese internet provider that my parents signed up for to receive Asian TV channels via the internet.  They didn't tell me ahead of time, otherwise I would have cancelled it and have them sign up with another internet provider.   They seem to have set up everything for my parents but when I checked things out, the crappy router they provided didn't have all the information for me to access it.  So began my odyssey in reaching them for help\n\nCustomer Service is almost non existent.  I've tried to contact them several times via their \"live\" chat button which only popped up a box to leave a message info to reach you back at.  After a few times and of this and emailing them directly over several days with no response or confirmation I tried to contact them via telephone, only to be put on hold for 30 mins until it put me through to a mail box to leave a voice message!  When I miraculously get through to them on a slow weekday afternoon, the service agent didn't speak English very well so it was hard to communicate the issue I was having.  \n\nTeksavvy and Acanac are much much better options for resolving technical issues and their internet service is exactly the same.  Plus those two are actually cheaper if you compare the prices on a monthly basis.  If you want Chinese TV content, one can simply just purchase the IPPTV device (Pacmall or internet) to watch Asian TV and use ANY internet service provider, so don't get sucked their sale pitch thinking this is the only option you  have.
