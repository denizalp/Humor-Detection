Took the kids here for bible school they were fed rotten food had to beg for water treated my kids like CRAP left them in the hot sun for 30 min it was summer are yall serious? because we weren't apart of the church. The volunteer s were not representing God. Check yourself before u do work in name of Jesus. There was no love here :(
