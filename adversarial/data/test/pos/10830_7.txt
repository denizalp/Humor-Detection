There were signs, but I tried to ignore them. Always go with your gut instinct as this story will tell you.\n \nIt started off with the coupon you get in the mail: 3 course meal all for $20.09. It piqued my interest since JW Marriott is not a dump figured why not? \nWe got there and immediately there was no one there on a weekend night \nWhen we got the bread basket it was warm and the assortment was good. But after taking a bite out of the cheese biscuit, olive bread, rolled wheat bread, and the rosemary bread the bread's quality was masked by the warmness. It was clearly old, but reheated. YUCK. \n\nI started to regret being enticed by the coupon, but decided let's give the food a try. \n\nA) Parsnip bisque: Canned soup would have tasted better. There was oil sitting on top of the soup! The flavor was too strong and it didn't have the right consistency a bisque should have. \nB) Salad: Most decent dish there. You can't go wrong here just need fresh lettuce, which there was a pile of. The dressing was too thick though. It tasted processed. \nAt least the tomatoes and manchengo cheese sufficed. \nC) Salmon with baby potatoes: Salmon was overcooked and too salty. \nThe other choice was a steak, which I also tasted to make sure I wasn't being too harsh of a critic..the steak was despicable. No flavor, overcooked. \nD) Dessert: Strawberry shortcake and Chocolate Mousse. \nWhy even bother at this point? \nBut I had to see...the desserts failed miserably too. \n\nThe only highlight of the night was finding a new wine that I like: \n \nCupcake Sauvignon Blanc
