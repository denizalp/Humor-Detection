I am just a simple man with simple tastes but believe that as an adult I have earned the right to pay more than $4.99 to get my drink on.  I also believe that I should not have my pants pulled down by the price of booze either. Though this location is smaller than the other LDL's I have been in, this one works great in a pinch and the beer, wine, spirits are affordable.
