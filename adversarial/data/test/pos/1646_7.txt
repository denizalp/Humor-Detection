Maybe Yelp will get it together because there are two Spork Pit listed at the same location and a friend said that they sent them a email about this a couple of weeks ago, time to combine, it may happen in the next century.\nAnyway, Spork Pit was a good stop for lunch.  Not crowded and got to enjoy the outdoor seating, but bring a cushion if you plan on stay a long time the seats at the tables are the grate type and just not comfortable.  To order you go to the end of the counter and fill out a check list and give it to the person preparing the meal.  \nI had the Brisket sandwich with two sides, a Mac & Cheese and a Coleslaw.  My Brisket sandwich had some pickled onions and pickle and a sauce.  Really enjoyed the sandwich and the brisket was tender.  The Mac & Cheese was OK but a little underwhelming, wish it had a little more flavor.  The Coleslaw was meh, just not that good but everyone has different ideas on what Coleslaw should taste like.  They have three sauces at the table but only one was labeled.  All very different.  One was a vinegar based and tasty, one I think was called Texas and very good and never really tried the last sauce.  \nThe service was kind of funny.  The guy at the cash register gave me my root beer and then answered the phone and then did not ring me up.  Finally he got back to me and could not get it together.  Anyway the Brisket was good.
