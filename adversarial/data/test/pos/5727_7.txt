Strolled in around 10 AM on a Sunday morning. There was a wait for outdoor seating (which is great for people watching!) Since I was starving, we decided to just eat inside as there wasn't a wait.\n\nI ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs and my fianc√© ordered the cinnamon apple waffle.\n\nWe totally wanted to go with crepes or something French since we were eating here, but it's what we were craving at the time.\n\nThe corned beef hash and eggs was the best I've yet to ever have! The corned beef was sooo yummy, and the poached eggs were cooked perfectly! \n\nHis cinnamon apple waffle was great too! It came with a side of house made whipped cream which was super light and fluffy- yum!\n\nBreakfast here is great and next time we're in town, we'll definitely stop in for dinner!
