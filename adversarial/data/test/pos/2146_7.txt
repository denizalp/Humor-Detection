Solid museum located at Springs Preserve- entry is free with park admission\/hand stamp. There is one main exhibit showing everything you ever wanted to know about Vegas, and one that changes seasonally- currently it's about communication technology. There's also an education area and a gift shop. Surrounding grounds are great to extend your visit, but that's another review.\n\nWhen I say the main museum exhibit has everything you ever wanted to know about Vegas, I'm not kidding- you start with prehistoric fossils and current animals, specifically the nocturnal dessert critters, then segue into the various flora and landforms including a great area on caves, before getting into Nevada statehood, famous residents, government, and the culture (original native american indian tribes from the area, impacts of the gold rush and oil boom, atomic testing and research, mob ties to business and creation of the Strip, showgirls and neon lights).\n\nThis museum manages to cover a lot of information and topics in a relatively limited space, with a lot of visuals to appeal to younger audiences- however, the many plaques are packed with info that's more appealing for adults so kiddos may get restless here. As Eric mentioned, I'm surprised by the lack of modern exhibit topics.
