I've now seen Le Reve twice and am no closer to having a clue as to how to interpret it, but it is a beautiful, exhilarating, breathtaking experience.  Dancing, diving, acrobatics, music, drama, comedy, and doves.  You should have a few drinks beforehand to prepare yourself and then several afterwards to try to wrap your mind around it.
