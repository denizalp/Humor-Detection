This really is a hidden gem. I didnt even know about this place, until a local moms group informed me of it and that they had a discounted fun day coming up, where the easter bunny would make an appearance.\n\nThurs, I went with my neighbor to give this place a go, and I'm so glad I did. They had a special going where it was only 3.50 to get in if you checked into facebook. (Its normally $7)\n\nThere was so muc to do. We stayed three hours and my daughter cried when we had to go. Below is all the things that had.. I know must are the usual things but acouple were just speciial one time things.\n\n- swings hanging from the ceiling. Not just two regular swings but another car one, and a choo choo swing\n\n- a trampoline! My two yr old had never been on one and loved it. I noticed there was padding on the sides and that made me feel safe in her jumping there\n\n- a little play house with food and groceries inside. leilah got to let her imagination run wild.\n\n- a rock wall, which my little one was too tiny for but hey, maybe someday!\n\n-little basket ball hoops and soft basketballs. \n\n- huge legos. Now my legos at home look lame, haha. BUT my daughter had fun putting them together and making a house that was bigger than her.\n\n- A ball pit. Its not as big as mickey dee's but its just as cool. Kids can jump in and feel safe. its nice and clean and theres even some hidden alphabet ducks at the bottom.\n\n- four slides. two are attached to this place house that they can run through, that has a bridge. The other two are by themselves. Ones tiny and the second is for the dare devils. Of course my child likes the big one.\n\n- They had tons of paper and crayons.\n\n- The easter bunny was there, giving out hugs and high fives. you could even get your picture taken with him for free. My kid was obsessed and literally followed him everywhere and wanted to touch his fluffy tail and ears. It was adorable\n\n- They have a zip line! WAY TOO COOL! There was a line for this but it was well worth it. Leilah screamed, laughed and didnt want to get off. They sit in the swing and fly from the end of the room to another. Thats something Ive def never seen anywhere else. It was the cherry on top if you know what i mean.\n\n- A car the kids sit on and go down on a little track. its simple, safe and fun. \n\n- Facepainting. At first, she was a little unsure. But once i said it was makeup she was all in and ran over. She sat real steal, and the lady doing it was very kind and patient. She got an adorable star with glitter.\n\nOverall, I cant wait to come back to this place! I will post all the pictures so you can see the different items i described. \n\nMon, wed, friday its open 9am to 5pm! Tues are thurs are special classes, then normal play is 12pm, to 5pm.\n\nI really loved that they gave me a list with special days throughout the months where they do cool things. Ex, pizza night, date nights, day camps or other special days. The prices for those are different but theyre very reasonable.
