Called #1 Plumbing.. regarding a rental.  They gave a 3 hr window to tenant yesterday then changed to a midnight yesterday or 4pm today with tenant.  Then they just called tenant and said they can not come out until Tuesday.  Besides an upset tenant, they never called me, the customer to inform me.  Instead I have to hear from an irate tenant.  Poor customer service!!
