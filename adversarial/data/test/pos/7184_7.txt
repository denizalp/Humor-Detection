I've grown to love this little bar and also consider it one of my favorite Happy Hour spots. Their selections of wine are terrific and the price points are very fair. I've always found 4 or 5 wines that I'd like to try on their list of whites or bubbles and my husband has felt similarly on the reds list. This isn't typical for either of us in Pittsburgh bars, so Allegheny Wine Mixer is a clear standout. They also often have a featured region on their wine menu. \n\nThey do half pours for $4 during Happy Hour starting at 5pm weekdays so it's an excellent time to try something you might not be familiar with to see how you like it. \n\nThe fruit, cheese, and charcuterie plates are delicious and service has always been terrific. We love sitting at the bar but even with a decent sized group at a back table our service could not have been better. Solid 4.5 Stars!
