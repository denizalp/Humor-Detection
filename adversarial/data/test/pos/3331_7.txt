This is what shopping should be like everywhere. The mall is big, spacious, clean, well lit, and trendy. It also feels premium and expensive. \n\nThey have so many retailers. You could spend a whole day shopping here and be guaranteed to find what you're looking for. \n\nIt does a great job at blending higher end stores and more accessible stores. \n\nIt's definitely worth having a look at if you're in Toronto.
