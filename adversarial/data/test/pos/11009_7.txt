I don't know what's happened lately. Last Saturday was my 2nd trip to 5Church and while the first was an extraordinary lunch service, the latest  brunch left a lot to be desired.\n\nArrived around 1pm and was seated by the hostess, we got to our table and our waiter...you know what, I don't think I caught his name. I'm sure he said it but the music was too loud to hear him. On top of that, he really couldn't hear us... at all. Every other thing he said to us was \"what\" or \"could you repeat that.\" It got very annoying throughout the brunch service.\n\nDrinks arrived, I ordered sweet tea... well they didn't lie. It was WAY too sweet. It was almost indiscernible from just sugar syrup, no tea flavor at all. No big deal, I asked the waiter to take that one and bring me a half & half tea to cut the sugar... well 15 minutes came and went and not only had we not ordered yet, but I still didn't have my tea.\n\nWaiter arrived again, without my replacement drink. We placed our brunch order and I waited once again for my drink, which arrived 20 minutes into brunch...\n\nThe food arrived and was...OK. My poached egg and crab cake was cooked well but was under-seasoned. My nephew's french toast was good. The Shrimp 'n Grits were good but again, under-seasoned. Nothing horrible, but nothing great.\n\nSo after a non-impressive brunch, we waited on the check... and waited, and waited. To note, the restaurant was at about 1\/4 capacity... there were at least 4 waiters and waitresses covering about 10 tables. After we finally got the check, it took another 10 minutes for the waiter to come back with the receipt, this time it was a different waiter. I'm not sure if the other one was just tired of my constant requests for drinkable beverage or got tied up on another table. In any case, we really didn't receive a farewell from anyone at the restaurant besides the hostess who said bye to us.\n\n...so yeah, that's that. It seems like the standards of service were in a free-fall this Saturday. Next visit will probably be with friends who want to go, because I can't see myself going on my own accord any time soon.
