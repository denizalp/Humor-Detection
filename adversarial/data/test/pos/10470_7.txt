I ate here with a family friend and her mother to celebrate her mom's birthday. \n\nUgh, unfortunately, I have to say that the folks that run this place ought to be ashamed of themselves. \n\nI already had a bad taste in my mouth even before walking in after seeing the large banner advertising that this establishment is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. \n\nWe waited approximately ten to fifteen minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad after hearing of the epic wait times for a table here. \n\nIt wasn't worth it. The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were \"improperly aged,\" as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. \n\nThe pork chop that my \"aunt\" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. \n\nThe service was cordial but average. \n\nAll of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner. If you need to advertise that you are the best, it means that you clearly aren't or you already had plans to reduce quality and\/or cut costs.
