Now that I'm sober enough to write a review, here's what I remember. My one pet peeve about most bars is how hypermasculine they can be, full of bros and testosterone and rah rah. This place, thankfully, is the opposite of that. Norte Dame Des Quilles is a queer\/trans-friendly, bro-free piece of heaven. It has cute decor and nice tunes, complete with an altar and graffiti-clad restrooms. The drinks are solid, and you can enjoy them without creepy male aggression or yuppie pretentiousness. We were mostly at the bar (super sweet bartender) but there was a whole other side of the location that had a couple small bowling lanes. For a Friday night they didn't seem super busy which was actually nice to not have to fish through crowds of people. The one drawback was that I thought they had food options (according to previous reviews) but that wasn't the case (at least for this night). But it wasn't the end of the world and there were plenty of other food options in the neighborhood anyways. I would definitely come back here again!
