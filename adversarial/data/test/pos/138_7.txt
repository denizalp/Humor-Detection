I really truly did want to try Egg Works after having it bookmarked for so long. The parking lot had plenty of parking. We arrived mid-morning so we avoided the morning rush and were seated promptly. Looking around everyone was taking food to go so we opted to share an omelette and get an extra muffin with the Yelp check-in. I asked the waiter if this would be okay and she said yes. We ordered the works omelette as it seemed to have a little bit of everything.\n\nOur muffins arrived and neither of us was impressed with it. Sure it was warm and the butter melted on it but the flavor I was expecting just wasn't there. Our omelette arrived and the portion was really huge. I was disappointed as everything was so chopped and mushed that you couldn't distinguish any of the contents and this we both found disgusting. The even more disgusting part is yet to come. When our bill arrived, we noticed we were charged for the muffin in addition our omelette. No big deal, or so I thought. Thought they'd take care of it when we checked out at the cash register but boy, I didn't think it would take a whole lot of time.\n\nThe cashier started to pull up our check and I let her know about the Yelp check-in. She proceeded to insist that because we ordered an \"extra\" muffin that's why we were charged. After explaining it she proceeded to ask the hostess if the Yelp check-in was still valid. If anyone should know these things, you'd think it would be the cashier who rings people up all day. Now there was a line of at least 3 people waiting to pay their checks and I could certainly feel their eye rolls over waiting during this whole ordeal. It wasn't the $2 muffin, but the sole principal that if you have something on your Yelp page, you should honor it. Lastly, they had to have the manager come over and remove it from our bill. \n\nI'm not quite sure I understand the hype of this place. Come if you have an abundance of time to kill, but don't expect the food to be anything special. There are plenty of other places in the area that we've been to that rank way higher than Egg Works. Sorry, but unfortunately we won't be coming back here.\n\n2016 Review #57
