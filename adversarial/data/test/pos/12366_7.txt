This reopened venue located on the ground floor of The Ogden used to be the Skullery.  I came here with a friend to see the #downtownpodcast recorded live.  I prefer the Inspire theater location for this event  because of the size and much more available seating.  The space was very small for filming and was not setup to handle a decent audience. The bar itself is also tiny and cavernous and not setup up for social collisions. The tiny private booths walled off give the impression that please don't interrupt my conversation. Staff also seemed unfriendly or unwelcoming to the people that essentially pay their wages....the customers.  Where do they find these social introverts that can only connect with people on via text, FB, Snapchat, or twitter. I might be back but I am sure this place will be rebranded by that time, especially if they continue to flounder there guest service. Hire professionals not your friends.
