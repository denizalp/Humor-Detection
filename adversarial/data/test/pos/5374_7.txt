Came here while waiting for our flight out of Phoenix. Let me get this out of the way, customer service here was HORRIBLE. Like your worst nightmare horrible. The lady at the counter actually looked like she wanted to stab me for ordering something. No joke. While we were eating our food one of her coworkers actually yelled something very profane. That's the kind of establishment you're dealing with. \n\nHowever, the food was pretty good for airport food. Not the best burger you'll have, but overall pretty good. I simply had a cheeseburger and it wasn't overly priced and was decent enough. \n\nIf you're in this airport and have some time to kill while being hungry, I'd suggest this place unless you can find something better.
