We got our car from this place six months and 15 days ago. Our cars engine exploded and had to be totalled out because they didn't disclose all the information about this vehicle. Now we have to pay more than the car is even worth to repair it, and they refuse to admit it was their fault and take care of their customer because it is only 15 days past the warranty.  Bottom line,  do not go to this place. They will screw you over any Chance they get and when you call to talk to them reasonably they chew you out and say they will garnish your wages if you don't pay for your totalled out POS vehicle.
