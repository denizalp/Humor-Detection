Wow, I felt like my head was a peice of art let alone getting my hair cut. Talk about first impressions, this one will last for a lifetime.\n\nTaylor saw my hair as a project, and perfected it to his masterpiece. The hairline has no beggining and no end, the way a fade should be. He topped it all off with a style and razor finish, keeps me lookin just so fresh and so clean.\n\nI think he may have stolen business away from my regular stylist. Time to jam out to some OutKast in my new-do.
