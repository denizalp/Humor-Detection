Pay show tow  = Peixoto. That's how you pronounce the family name who discovered this Brazilian coffee family business! And I'm glad they continued the local art of coffee! \n\nThe gentleman behind the counter was very very knowledgable with each drink listed on the menu for each one that I asked as they were unique than the usual corporate coffee makers.\n\nThe entire area of seatings all were unique pieces and varied with a couple cozy couches, small coffee tables, large picnic like table and some high bar stools, etc. if I remember correctly. The Lighting was great during the day time. \n\nTheir peppermint chocolate mocha was absolutely delicious and topped with their house made marshmallows, a sprig of fresh mint and a heart designed by the barista!! This dreamy beverage will capture your heart and soul!! \n\nKnowledgable and family-like staff and nice atmosphere to lounge around. Have to try the rest of the menu for the new year!
