The daily special was fried chicken and crazy cheap champagne, but it was a tasting menu kind of night for us. \n\nThe food was good and served in some interesting ways: the Assador de Barro is house-made sausage set on fire in a pig clay dish. \n\nThe cocktails and conversation were flowing. I loved the bourbon and fig pairing in the Otto e Mezzo, but the highlight of the evening was connecting with a kindred spirit. \n\nNot a bad Tuesday night.
