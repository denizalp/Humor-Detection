We are remodeling our pool and were sent here to look at mini pebble, tile and stone samples. \n\nThe showroom is set up in a user friendly manner with large displays all over the walls so we really didn't need a tremendous amount of assistance but the staff were extremely helpful and quick to bring brochures and samples.\n\nThe only downside is the limited showroom hours as they close weekdays at 3pm making it difficult to visit for working folks.
