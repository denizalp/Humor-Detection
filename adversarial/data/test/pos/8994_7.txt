Kennywood is a huge part of part of my childhood landscape. (like many other reviewers.) School picnics, high school band nights, date nights, family trips, memories of my grandmother riding the roller coasters with us, my silly brothers, sister and cousins roughhousing and laughing our heads off... all these memories have morphed into current-day new memories with friends and family; nieces and nephews and various other offspring and family. My husband and I got engaged at Kennywood, on a bench near the Pittsburgh Plunge, appropriately enough! \n\nMany friends who have moved to Pittsburgh from elsewhere have been baffled by \"the locals\" or \"Yinzers\" devotion to this park, complaining that other parks like 6 Flags, Geauga Lake, Hershey Park or Cedar Point are better and worth the drive. I guess it's all about what you want, or what you like. For me, going to Kennywood is almost like going home. I love big, flashy amusement parks with thrilling rides too, but none are like Kennywood to me. I know what I'm going to see at Kennywood. (except when there's a new ride) I know what food is available, I know what characters are going to be bopping around the park for photos, and I know that I won't get cotton candy or fudge till I'm ready to leave, and will happily wait in that endless line at the cart near the gate. I'm ok with all of that. I love it. It's an old park, and along with the newer rides like the Sky Rocket are rides that have been there since we were kids, like the parachutes, the merry go round, the Thunderbolt, Jack Rabbit and Racer, the Kangaroo, Log Jammer and others. I don't expect folks who didn't grow up here to \"get\" it. It's not a big, fancy, flashy park with tons of slick rides. (though there are several.) It's a pretty, family oriented park that is an historic landmark, where some of the happiest hours of my youth were spent, and some of the most fun family days of my adult life as well.\n\nOH, *and*... after the regular season there are now TWO events at Kennywood that you should definitely check out. Phantom Fright Nights is now an established fall event thru Halloween. Along with the scary music, decorations, zombies and other characters waiting to ambush you, and the walk-through haunted \"houses\" and other attractions, expect huge crowds and LONG lines to get on\/in any of the rides or attractions. Still, it's a fun event that has become a tradition in our house. And the newest addition to the Kennywood calendar is the Christmas lights! I didn't even know about this until it was almost over, and we managed to get to one of the last nights it was open- I'm so glad we did! I LOVED it! Bonfires were maintained at a few points through the park to warm fingers and toes, hot chocolate and other drinks were sold, and everything was transformed into a holiday wonderland. Some of the rides were open, and a great light show coordinated to music on the lake played at various times through the evening. Holiday music poured through  the park's speaker system, and it was just a fantastic evening. We loved it.
