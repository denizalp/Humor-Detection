I hope Yelp realizes someone is stuffing the ballot box on this place. Its a nice club, but for 17 people to write \"amazing\" in their review is not even believeable especially when just getting in is a nightmare. The club itself is great. If youve been to LIFE or Hakkasan you know whats in store and OMNIA doesnt bring much else to the table. The moving chandelier is a pretty cool new concept too. \n\nThey seem to have went for bigger=more people=more money. Cant blame them but the crowd was massive. Doesnt equate to a better experience just means more people to fight at the bar and so forth.  \n\nGetting in is where they lost 2 stars. Holy moly what a clusterbomb. You would think the world was ending and they had to let the elite get on the first ship out of town. Our group of 8 girls and 3 guys with a tbl was passed over again and again to get in til ppl just gave up and left. We eventually got in but table was given away. We should have just waited in GA line but as ppl left they said it was a waste of $30 bucks. I wouldnt pay to get in bc being a local its usually compd and like I said its similar to LiFe and Hakkasan.\n\nIf you like waiting and playing their game enjoy but we wont be back for awhile and we go to EVERY club in Vegas but these door hosts need to get their act together. Show up at 930pm if you want to avoid the 1.5 hour wait.
