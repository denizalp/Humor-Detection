WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STARS: DO NOT COME HERE! HORRIBLE PLACE \n\nMy boyfriend and I previously came to this dim sum place with a few family members one Sunday afternoon (it's really packed at this time) and had a quite pleasant experience. So much that we decided to come back just the two of us today for dinner. \n\nThe first time we came here, our relatives ordered for us since it was our first time so we didn't exactly know how to order when we came back. We ordered some siu mai, har how, shrimp rice rolls, and some deep fried shrimp dumplings. We had no complaints about the food (it was average) except for the fact that we were left with so much leftovers since the tiny order sheet doesn't specify how many pieces are given in each and the waitress was so quick to grab our order sheet that she couldn't even answer any questions we had. They move so fast for no reason and when they walk away it's hard to catch them again- I was trying to order drinks and she walked away from me. As if it was so busy and I was wasting her time, when really only a few tables were filled in the restaurant at the time. \n\nThe bill arrives at your table, and let me tell you: this bill does not specify what you ordered whatsoever which makes this place even shadier than it already is. SO SHADY. They just circle a bunch of random numbers and put some total beside, as if they're just expecting you to pay whatever they write. I didn't have a right feeling about it so I asked for a breakdown of the bill and it turns out they tried charging me for extra dishes than I had ordered and received. This changed the bill amount SIGNIFICANTLY when I pointed out this mistake!!! Wth really?! In their drink menu it also said $1.50 per iced tea can and when it came to the price breakdown it they charged me $2.50 per can. At least be consistent with your pricing, come on.\n\nAfter this whole confusion, I was already about to leave with a negative feeling about this place thinking it couldn't get worse. The waitress passes me the machine to pay and puts it % tip automatically and hands it over. Of course I was going to tip her, but I looked over to my boyfriend and asked him how much % would be reasonable and she INTERRUPTS ME and tells me to put in 10% or 15%! Excuse me?! Last time I checked, the customer will decide how much they would like to tip you. I then asked her if she could wait as she was just standing right beside me watching what I input in the machine. Just cause she did that I tipped her 5% (I should've tipped her NOTHING) and when she saw she laughed and said \"really 5%?\", threw the receipt on the table, and walked away. \n\nAfter this, we were so ready to leave but we waiting on our dessert and we couldn't cancel it cause we already paid for it. We waited for 20 minutes because the waitress wouldn't even walk our way (she would just stare at me from afar as I'm waving my hand in the air) and my boyfriend had to go up to one of the employees to demand we get it soon. After he did this, it came out a few minutes later-- turns out they didn't even process our dessert order in the kitchen but made us pay for it. \n\nThese people only care about their money and it's sad when they shame you on your way out because of how much you've tipped. They are all SCAMMERS!! You should not trust this place!!! The food is average anyways, definitely not worth coming back ever again. The customer service here will definitely make you have the worst possible dining experience ever. I have never been treated so horribly at a restaurant. I wish I read these terrifying past reviews before I decided to go here.
