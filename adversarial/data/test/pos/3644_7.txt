I've been here a few times, whether to waste time waiting for something or someone or bum off the wi-fi. So far all my experiences here have been pleasant. Considering it's location on the downtown ASU campus, I've never seen it crowded or messy. I feel bad for the suckers that live on the upper floors of the building in the dorms, smelling all that Starbucky goodness in the morning and their inability to obtain it due to their on-campus student budget! \n\nSarcasm there, I really don't do Starbucks Coffee or any of their specialty drinks if I can help it. Late afternoon yesterday, after a day of fighting with ASU and their course enrollment hardassedness, I choose to grab a Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino to keep me awake enough to get on the shuttle. The barista added a carmel drizzle, which doesn't normally go with this kind of drink, but was a nice touch of creativity...well basically as creative as Starbucks can get. This morning, was less stressful, and I got the same drink, same niceness of the staff, still surprisingly clean (I'm still trying to catch it in the same state that Korina has experienced it) and the same beverage. \n\nStrange thing, about three different people in and around that Starbucks were wearing Guinness branded t-shirts, coincidence? Maybe so. But if the two beverage companies are planning some massive merger, I want royalties for noticing it first!
