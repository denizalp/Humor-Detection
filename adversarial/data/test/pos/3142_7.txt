Touristing my way through Scottsdale, I'd bookmarked a few of those \"Food Network\" locations prior to my vacation. And y'know what? Shame on me, because that technique has led me wrong more times than not. \n\nFollowing a tasty dinner, my wife and I stopped at Sweet Republic for a small sweet treat. Neither of us had enough room for one of the massive sundaes, so it was a single scoop for both of us, and I topped mine with a roasted marshmallow because that seemed like an awesome idea.\n\nSadly, the marshmallow tasted like a cross between melted plastic and butane. Could've been the torch that was used to fast-roast it, but I commented to my wife how it tasted seriously foul.\n\nMy ice cream was pretty good. I went with the almond toffee something or other. Not the best I've ever had, but not bad in my opinion. \n\nMy wife went with salted caramel and complained that it was completely tasteless. I sampled it, and had to agree. No flavor at all. \n\nI thought the prices were pretty fair. I know other yelpers complain that they're a bit steep, but I think for a small family location like this (especially with all the attention they get) they were pretty reasonable. \n\nService was super friendly and fast too. \n\nAll in all, I don't know that I'd make it a regular place if I lived in the area, but it wasn't too bad. Maybe they need to work on a few of the flavors, tho.
