Helicopter ride over the LV strip...\n\nHeck yeah it was fun~! Heck yeah it was kinda scary~! \n\nThey take you on a 10 to 15 minute tour of the strip. We went in the evening so it was really pretty. I made the mistake of wearing a short dress...almost busted a Marilyn Monroe...ya know what I mean?? NG. NG. Besides my dress flying up...everything was perfect and memorable. Don't I have the best bf in the world??
