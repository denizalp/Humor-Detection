Frozen treat are good, especially during the hot summer months.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for a crushed-ice (like Rita's), regular ice cream, or gelato.  I have to admit, I've only had gelato a handful of times... it's good, but much different from ice cream.\n  \nHow does gelato differ from regular ice cream?  Butterfat.  Gelato has lower butterfat content, and is also churned a little slower, making it denser than ice cream. \n\nIt had been some time since I enjoyed a cup of gelato, so while in Shadyside, I stopped into Mercurio's on Walnut Street.  \n\nGelato is usually served from rectangular stainless steel containers.  There were many flavors to choose from at Mercurio's; (fresh fruit choices looked especially good) I decided on chocolate.  The dessert was served in small cup with a teeny spoon.  My first bite was good- the flavors were intense, and the texture was smooth.  The difference from regular ice cream was clear; it wasn't as creamy.\n\nVerdict\n\nGelato is a traditional Italian dessert that is meant to be consumed in small portions. My gelato was excellent- prepared by ice cream artisans with great care.  It's slightly-less creamy texture could be the perfect finish to a delicious meal.  Since butterfat runs my veins in abundance, I'll stick with ice cream.
