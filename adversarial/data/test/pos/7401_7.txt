OK this place is a nice little grocery store. They do even have the cute little shopping carts for the kiddies.\nThe fruit selection is horrible though, the strawberries have some red ones on top and then if you flip the package over they are all white ,not even pink.\nRed raspberries were all smashed up in the container.\nSo not the place to buy fruit. I did buy Black berries because, I needed them and I did not want to go to another store. But, they really had no flavor. I do not know what causes that, they looked ripe.\nOther than fruit you can get some nice things there. They staff is nice. However, I brought my own bag and did not get any $$ off my bill or even a raffle ticket. I used to get one when I brought my own bag to the one in PHX.\nI think the worst thing is the Double tax in Tempe grocery stores. I know this is not the fault of the store. But, it is a lot of money and I do not like it. Which makes me not want to shop in Tempe. Parking is limited in this lot as it is a very busy place.
