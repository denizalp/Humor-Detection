Cypress Street Marketplace is a food court in the middle of the casino in Caesars Palace. It's very convenient, but I'd highly recommend skipping it as a food option.\n\nThe atmosphere is actually pretty cool, tables in the middle, surrounded by different food vendors. It's very, VERY pricey for what it is though. To give you an example; I ordered a double cheese burger, with fries and a drink for about $23. Now, if the burger was good, I'd have no problem with this place, but, the burger sucked. It really did. It looked GORGEOUS, but tasted like a gas station burger.\n\nFor the price, I'd skip this place, and head on over to one of the many kick-ass restaurants in Caesars or the surrounding hotels.
