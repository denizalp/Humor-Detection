The Las Vegas Estate Sales, LLC does not value their customers. Specially if it is a Savvy customer. \nThey like the customers to be ignorant so , they can get over them.This Estate Sale is forgetful  of good customers. I have spent thousands of dollars since the so called \"Estate Sale of The Century\" was done. John, although their prices were through the roof; I was able to make deals with him (in the past).Now he avoids eye contact and forgot who I am. However,  none of the things I purchased were able to be flipped. This last estate sale at 89121 the prices not only were through the roof but in some instances over the retail price for used items. Pam or Pat and another employee, I saw making deals on the first day but when it was my turn she rapidly let me know that she will not do any negotiations  with me. She was rude and flat. Obviously, was clear to me that I was not of the right persuasion for her to even consider making a deal; but when few weeks or month back she needed to empty the house she was doing negotiations since the first day, which I went both days until all the merchandise was sold.(And I was able to flip items) The lack of business skills and dealing with customers its beyond belief . Double priced items, arrogant attitude, among other things which I will not mention... are the reasons for the one star rating. I am well known in the Las Vegas estate sale and auction scene here in Nevada and adjacent states ...and  I have good relations with all of them except Las Vegas estate sales. I guess that's why they are selling their business.
