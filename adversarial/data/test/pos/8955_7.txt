Only come if you want your expensive blonde balayage messed up and turned to a caramel color. \n\nWorst experience in my LIFE at a salon. This place is very unprofessional and I wish I never came here. On the phone, they told me the cost was $25-$45 and they charged me $50 in the end. \n\nI came here because of the marvelous reviews. I thought only a unskilled colorist wouldn't know how to simply tone hair. My mistake I should of asked if they knew how to tone Asian hair. \n\nI came in at 5 on the dot. I wasn't seen until 10 minutes later with Megan. When I was finally seen, she came to me in the middle of her getting her roots touched up. Ive never been to a salon who did their hair the same time as their clients!!!!! \n\nSo I told her exactly what I wanted. TAKE BRASS OUT AND KEEP ME LIGHT and leave in the toner longer to get some silver pieces. She then brushed my hair aggressively where I thought my hair was going  to come out of my head.  She brought me back to the hair wash station and barely washed my hair and slabbed the toner on my head very unevenly. While that was happening, she splashed toner in my eye and on my arms. \n\nShe sat me back in the chair and was never to be seen again. While I was sitting in the chair, my back hairs kept falling out of the clips and down into my back. The hair was dripping water and just soaking my back away. Her work station was very messy also. Towels and hair were everywhere. I wanted to put my purse on the hook but there was already a purse hanging there. \n\nShe came back after she looked like she washed her hair. She brought me back to the wash station. Barely washed my hair and told me to go back to the chair with my hair soaking wet and water coming out of my ears. \n\nShe blowed dried my hair on the HIGHEST HEAT and burning me a couple times because she was that careless. She gave me the worst and painful blow out I've ever received. My hair was just sticking out from all over the place.\n\nAfter my hair was dried, I told her she has darkened my hair. She denied it. She told me my hair sucks out in the toner faster and that's what happened. She also told me she followed the standards of toning. WTF???? What standards of toning? There shouldn't be only one standard when there's so many different types of hair you're working with. She seemed like she was on a white girl hair standard. She def doesn't have Asian hair experience and fucked up my hair. \n\nI'm very upset on how my hair came out and even cried when I got home. I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
