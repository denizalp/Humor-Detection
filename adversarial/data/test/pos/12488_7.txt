We stop in Friday for happy hour.  The sandwich board says 4-8pm!\n\nAs we enter we realize it's just us and 3 dudes at the bar.  We get menus from our female bartender and ask what type of margaritas they have.  \"Besides house?\" One of the guys pipes up saying they have strawberry, and maybe enough for watermelon.  Ok... House it is!\n\nThe music is loud nicki minaj which my mom does not care for so one of the 3 dudes nicely changes it to maroon 5 for my mom.\n\nShe pours our drinks generously, served in chilled glasses and they look delicious.  Once I get a taste... Um no!\n\nMy mom and I pay right away, since we both know 1 is enough!  As we are getting ready to leave one of the guys asks if we liked our drinks.  I was honest and said No right away.  My mom says \"we like fresh lime\" to which he replies \"it has fresh lime, lemon, and orange juices alone with triple sec and sweet & sour.\"  There's your problem buddy.  He said I can check Yelp because a lot of people like the margaritas!! Haha that will surely convince me... Not.\n\nHe then complains about how busy it gets on Fridays and how it's hard to bring chips & salsa, take orders, and run food to the patrons.  We just smile and leave.
