Came to this restaurant with another person and both ordered Lobster Tails.  I ate one bite........and noticed the tail smelled like it was rotting so I flipped it over and it was BLACK!\nThe second tail was mushy in consistency and tasted just ok. The black tail was sent back and I was given a shy reluctant apology asking if I wanted anything else.  Ummm no lol. The chief here is not Culinary trained.  No real chief would let a tail leave the kitchen that smelled like that.  And it's obvious the tails are not being stored properly and are expired.  \nI'm a local I drive a golf cart down and I can say without a doubt this restaurant will not survive.  Celine Dion lives in this community and they are serving Bad shellfish? Girl bye lol. Btw I'm pregnant.  Hoping that I don't get food poising now and I have already called my doctor ..... he has informed me that I am probably going to get bacterial food infection in the next 12 hours and in rare cases it does affect the baby. Like wow
