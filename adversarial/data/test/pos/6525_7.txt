Wow. If you want to be treated like *garbage* by thick-necked bouncers THIS is the place to be. \n\nI was trying to get past one to join my group's table but evidently took the wrong route. Instead of saying \"Sorry, you can't get thru that way, please go around that way.\" I was blocked, stared down and simply told \"No, you need to leave\" and was then promptly knocked in the gut as he turned his tank of a body around, spilling my drink all over me. I was simply shocked!! I tried to ask him how to get where I needed to be, but this *horrible* human being actually turned his entire body away from me as I tried to get his attention. \n\nFine. Forget you. \n\nSo I got around the long way and get to where I needed to be. The girl that was taking care of our table was fantastically sweet and attentive, no problems there. After splitting away from the team to bounce on the dance floor, I come back to find our table over-crowded with invaders. Before I can even squeak, there's another ox grabbing me by the arm telling me I couldn't be there and some jerk who I had never seen before sitting at *our* table encouraging the bouncer to remove me!! \n\nI asked for a manager and was simply told NO. I asked if this is how they typically treat their guests, he just stares. I fibbed and said I was staying at the hotel rather than my friends, \"Is this how you treat your hotel guests?\" he answers \"I'm affiliated with the Bar, not the Hotel, so yeah. Don't like it? Leave.\"\n\nShocked, appalled, disgusted. \n\nThe Bar and Wait Staff were fine, but these VERY AGGRESSIVE bouncers have to GO before they either hurt someone our simply drive away all the customers.\n\nGo to Surrender or Drais, vastly superior evenings to be had there, WITHOUT getting pulled around like a ragdoll.
