Came in for a quick wet the whistle with family.  It was small & about as outdated as a Blueberry Hill that had tv's & served cheap hooch.  Crowded.  The weathered \"bartender\" was less than courteous, as expected though.  Now I can tell you this.  We didn't have to wait long to be served.  The problem though started when my girl ordered a Pinã Colada.  Bartender had that face that lazy ones make when you order something that forces them to bust out the blender.  Sorry lady.  Then she asked me what I wanted.  A simple Cape Cod.  I swear I was not trying to challenge anyone's vocational knowledgebase whatsoever!  It's. Not a complicated drink.  Just a vodka cran add a lime.  She asked me if I wanted pineapple or grapefruit juice?  Huh?..  My party witnessed me explain the simple ingredients.  The next person ordered a bud light.  I bet the bartender was like, \"yes! Trust the white person of the group to make sense.\" in her head, lol.  Then my brother said he was still thinking.  Obviously he picked up on the vibe we were getting from her.  In essence we were 4 people who came to a bar and asked for somewhat usual drinks.  She came back with a great pinã that she grumpily slapped together, huffin' & slightly puffin' during its construction before our eyes.  Hahaha ;) my drink came and instead of a bright cranberry red it was a golden clear pink and she popped open a Bud light.  Perplexed at the sight of my usual Cape Cods new colored tone.  I asked what my drink was?  She briskly trotted over and said, \"you told me grapefruit right?\" lol, I corrected her and she grabbled the drink away and uttered aloud, \"Then why did you say grapefruit!\" the cynical gent I am did not allow me to engage a close ended defense as such.  It came back correct.  We drank, and to mutual satisfaction I'm sure.  We left, never to return again. ;)
