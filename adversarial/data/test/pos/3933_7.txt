I have gone here for shoe repairs over the last few years. I think they do OK with simple shoe repairs, e.g., shoe shines and heel tap replacements. \n\nHowever, if the guy tells you he needs to send them out to the \"warehouse\" -- beware. My shoes were black booties, retailed for ~$300 and the heel which was covered with black patent had gotten caught in the sidewalk so there was a gash in the patent of one heel. I brought them in, he estimated $75 (yup, that's right -- top dollar). Reluctantly I agreed (my mistake -- should have retreated and tried other places). He also mentioned it would take two weeks (because they had to be sent to the \"warehouse\"). \n\nBottomline, they ruined the shoe, when they took the heel off to re-patent it, they damaged part of the bootie (where the heel meets the foot part of shoe). I complained, the Shoe Lab guy said \"it;s glue-it just needs a little cleaning\", after he tried cleaning - he realized it was damage and he agreed to send back to his warehouse. One month later because the \"warehouse was backlogged\", the boot was back but they could not fix it. Overall, it was not a quality job. I complained and the guy said he would give me the number to call the warehouse -- and made no concession for the poor customer service and the bad repair job that ruined the booties.
