A lot of people think the guy that runs this place is a total cock.   I can see that.  If you're not in there asking for the latest in indie rock or hip hop, this guy might sneer a bit.  \n\nHowever, I like him.  I get off  playing the \"Name an Obscure Band that  Pitchfork Really Likes\" game with him.  Plus, he's always given me great recommendations.  I've picked up special orders and hard-to-find indie stuff here and I'll keep going back, sneer-be-damned.
