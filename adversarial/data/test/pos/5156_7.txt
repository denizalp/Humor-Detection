2.5\n\nI don't know how to feel about the place. I went in really wanting to like it, but put it this way, would rather wait 2 hours for Guu. \n\nThe decor is very nice. And although small, it seems to fit a lot of people without line up.  A definite plus was how we were able to reserve a table for 14 (and no per set gratuity) on a Saturday night. \n\nAlthough service wasn't the best (I ordered 4 things that never came because it was forgot and we ended up canceling it, twice our order was wrong and the waitress not understand what I was saying most times) - she was very nice, gave us separate bills (3 groups) when asked, and when our order was messed up, we got an extra on the house. \n\nIt was only 7pm and about half the things we wanted to order was not available from the menu! (like Gyo Beef Tongue, Pork Belly - and Beef Curry instead of Chicken curry)\n\nWe began with takoyaki ($3.50 for 6 pcs - very much on par with Manpuku or Guu, but had a high ball to tako ratio  - but half the price!)\n\nWe also had the Dragon Roll and Spice Salmon skin roll. I've had better on Bloor street. There was no flavour in these. \n\nWe had a 20 piece sashimi platter for $22. It was good, small slices and thin - quite fresh, but lots of filler right like Ibi and Surf Clam.\n\nThere was also veggie chips ($3.50) an assortment of fried taro, seaweed and shrimp pops.\n\nBlack Cod was also very good, and we were disappointed when our 2nd order of it was missed. \n\nYou can skip the Curry - it was nothing special. \n\nYakisoba was good - and we also ended up trying the Seafood Yaki udon which was also very good, as she brought that to us by accident. \n\nEverything we ordered was devoured as it came, except for one - the teriyaki squid - we didn't even finish it.... \n\nOne thing that is odd about the restaurant is that you have so many izakaya and tapas style dishes, but the variety of it doesn't really give anything substantial unless you order a noodles\/entree (unlike Guu). The entrees are only plated for one person (big flat plate with rice and salad on it )and very difficult to share - i would suggest that they plate it in a way that is conducive to sharing, as most likely this is what people were doing. \n\nFor dessert there were only two options - mochi ice cream, or ice cream parfait with cornflakes on the bottom. For my fiance's birthday, i said mochi ice cream, but we got the parfait instead. \n\nOverall: there were many 2 star instances and disappointed faces - but there was also many +1 star moments too. \n\n(a comment about the website - highly annoying with pdfs for every pag of the menu - can't it be all one file!? and how it opens up in the same window, and I always end up closing it by accident) Also the menu is not up to date or complete on the website.
