My parents are dim sum snobs.  When they visit from out of town once in a blue moon, they demand to try a new dim sum place every time.\n\nUsing Yelp and the search words \"dim sum\" and \"Mississauga\", I came across Regal.   It was a bit of a trek for us but we figured it was worth it if the food was good.\n\nRegal is located in a converted Keg Steakhouse location.  The fire place was a dead giveaway.  How many Chinese restaurants have fire places?  Plus we looked up the address on Google Street View which showed a Keg there.  There's a huge patio attached so I wonder if they would ever do dim sum on the patio - what a novelty!\n\nWe arrived early on a Saturday morning, just before the rush so no wait for a table.  I was impressed with the classy decor.  Nice white linens on the tables and chair covers to boot!  \n\nNo carts for dim sum, just a check off menu.  No pricing on the menu either but we found out when the bill came - small ($3.30), medium ($4.30) and large ($5.30).  We did get the senior's discount of 20% off the total bill.  \n\nWe ordered an assortment of dim sum favourites totalling 10 items between the four of us.  Food came out fresh and hot, and had my mom raving \"Ooh, this is just like Hong Kong!\".  Now that's a compliment that translates into a 5-star rating.\n\nNeed to mention the service.  Good service, or just service in general, in Chinese restaurants is as rare as a sober Lindsey Lohan.  But I found the service at Regal quite excellent.  Servers were very attentive - never let an empty dish sit for very long, refilled tea pots quickly,  nearly hovering over us as we ate.  The restaurant wasn't very full so that might explain the super service.  Servers were friendly and polite with no attitude.  My mom is a walking attitude detector and easily offended so she would have sensed something right away.\n\nAt the end of the meal, my dad proclaimed \"Is it just me or does even the tea taste better here?\".  Wow, my parents are capable of compliments...I never knew that.
