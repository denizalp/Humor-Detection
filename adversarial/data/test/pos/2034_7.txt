One of the WORST nail salons in summerlin.\nThey need to staff accordingly. If they have high business volume with reservation and walk in, they need to know how to staff. Also learn how to KINDLY advise a guest there is no availability at that current time, not just blatantly say\" NO WE CAN'T HELP YOU!\" This was my second and last visit to this ridiculously unwelcoming nail bar.
