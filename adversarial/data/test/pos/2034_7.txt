I was in the area and my friends and I decided to have ayce sushi for lunch. We ordered nigiri, appetizers, and some rolls and dessert to finish it off. The service was amazing! Friendly staff, and intimate atmosphere. They serve quality fresh fish  and the chef puts just the right amount of rice. I definitely recommend this place and I live in the opposite side of town but I definitely will come out of my way to eat here again!
