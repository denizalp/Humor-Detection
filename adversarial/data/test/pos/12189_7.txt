Wish I could give no stars!!!! But to write a review I had to give this horrible piece of sh$% place a star. Okay let's start off with the lack of attention. This place couldn't have more incompetent people working if you paid them to be incompetent. I've lived here in Mesa for more than 20 years and have seen this place go down hill more and more each day with the lack of good employees.  My mother just had to have McDonald tonight and what a shocking surprise... As I'm in the drive-thru this car pulls up behind me with a bunch of dumb asses yelling and being just as I said (dumb asses). Of course once I pull up pay and move on to the next window what do I see???? Oh the employee I just paid for my food hanging out the window and snort cocaine given by the person in the vehicle behind me!!!! Seriously! Do you not have cameras either? Do you not drug test these morons handling your money and food everyday? And they ask to get paid more???? Are you fn kidding me!!!! $15.00 an hour my \na$$!!!
