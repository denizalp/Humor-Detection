I only used the service once, and it was a fairly simple process. But then a few days later I got a call from car2go saying I forgot to swipe out on the windshield (apparently clicking \"end trip\" on the touch screen wasn't enough), and that in the future I would be charged full day rate until the car is logged out. He said not to worry and they back dated my time to when I ended my trip. We'll he lied.. I was charged 110$ for the 20min of driving I did. Thanks car2go! You suck...
