Anything over medium rare is blasphemy (only tolerated if you're preggo in my books, okay?) and my experiences at Morton's of San Francisco did not go smoothly.\n\nI found Morton's here to be a tad better. Service was prompt and everything.\nThey made special menus for my friend's bachelorette dinner with her name on it but had the date completely wrong. It was July but the menu said April (haha) They quickly reprinted new ones with the right month.\n\nI admit, I had low expectations walking in. There are a plethora of exceptional steakhouses in Vegas, the strip is just chock full of them. However, Morton's was do-able.\n\nI always order medium rare. Like I said, anything done over that is just carnivorous sin. I think Morton's and I need a  steak cooking 101 because some sort of lost in translation thing is going on. \n\nMy definition of medium rare is a warm red center. What happens at Morton's? \n\nIt comes pink. \n\nThis happens at the San Francisco location as well.\n\n*sigh*\n\n\nI would have sent it back if I weren't starving from being on a liquid diet. \n\nDon't get me wrong!! I don't mean I was actually ON a liquid diet. I meant the Vegas diet. You know, booze.\n\nAnyway.
