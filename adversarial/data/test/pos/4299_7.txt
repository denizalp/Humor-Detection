So my family and I were starting to like this little spot. We'd come on Sat mornings looking to eat outside. Not sure if it's because we're Black Americans but each experience here has gotten worse. I was hoping it was a fluke but we won't be back. Slower service, cold food and little attention to details. Busy little spot but I'm guessing they don't want our money.
