I love this place!!\n\nI've never been a fan of group training of any kind because I feel like a total goober jumping around in front of strangers and steady state cardio is my nemesis e.g. treadmills, elliptical etc. I do only enough to keep my heart healthy and prefer lifting heavy weight with some active rest, getting me in and out of the gym in 45 minutes tops; but I have a confession to make....I'm in love with Zumba. \n\nI hate saying the word. I wish it had another name. Zumba! Zumba! Zumba!\nThere, maybe I can get over it and move forward.\n\nThe vibe at In The RA is truly fantastic and unlike anything I've experienced anywhere else. It's clear from the moment you walk in that this studio is the owners proverbial 'baby' and that feeling of genuine acceptance and caring extends to the entire staff. You actually feel like a total goober jumping around with a bunch of friends instead of strangers...and that I don't mind.\n\nIn The RA offers a slew of other classes as well including Real Ryder (which is like a spin class on steroids), Turbo Kick (my least favorite, meh) and even Yoga\/Pilates. I believe there is some sort of 'Flirty Fitness' class as well, which, if a pole were involved I'd be much more game to try.  (homegirl can work a pole ...shhhh)\n\nAnyway, you get the point.\n\nMy gym of choice is right next door, Tangible Fitness, so it's convenient to get some training in and then walk over for a class. I can't say Zumba anymore without my brain exploding so I'm going to leave it at that. \n\nThanks for bringing such a great studio to the valley and much success to you In The RA!
