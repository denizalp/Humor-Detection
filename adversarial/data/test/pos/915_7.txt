I would have given a higher rating, but after the waiter spilled a pitcher of ice water on two of the guests at our table, in front of a manager, and no one even acknowledged the incident.  (Management and service seem to be the consistent reason for poor reviews.). I just can't imagine why I would recommend anyone come here.\n\nOh and FYI, I posted the same review on OpenTable and it never was shown.  Apparently they don't post unfavorable reviews for the restaurants they work for.  So if you are looking for an accurate rating, don't trust their system.
