I hate to start my Yelp career off with a negative review but I had such a horrible experience at Petite Maison, I can't keep quiet about it.  My husband and I were spending the weekend in Phoenix for our 10 year anniversary and we specifically selected Petite Maison for the menu and good reviews.  We made reservations almost a week prior for Saturday night.  We were really looking forward to it.  \n\nWe arrived about 10 minutes late due to getting lost and trying to find parking.  We entered through the single entrance and I was impressed with the expansive, beautiful patio and the ambiance.  It was lush with plants, trees and twinkle lights.  We noticed right away that there was a table set and ready to go.  All the other tables were full and we could tell that the inside area was also packed.  We walked up to the hostess stand which was right outside the door of the small interior restaurant.  And so starts the fun.\n\nThere were people behind the podium. 2 men in chef whites and a woman.  One of the men was right up against the podium with his back to us.  They all glanced at us and turned back to their conversation and said NOTHING.  And so we stood in front of the podium, with their backs to us, feeling like idiots.  We looked around the patio and I was not amused to see that we were getting strange looks.  This went on for 1 to 2 minutes. AND STILL THEY STOOD WITH THEIR BACKS TO US!!!  Finally the hostess came up and I explained that we had reservations and were sorry we were 10 minutes late.  She literally said to us \"well everyone is running late tonight so you're going to have to wait\".  I'm not exaggerating.  I asked her where we should wait and she pointed to the bar area.  Since we didn't want to stand in the midst of all the diners on the patio, we went inside.  Well, that was a mistake because the room is so tiny that wherever we stood we had to move so someone could walk by.  Did I mention that there was still a set table waiting outside??\n\nWe decided to go back outside since there was no room in the interior of the restaurant.  We had no idea where to go since we didn't want to stand at the podium in the middle of the patio watching people eat so we went to.... yes, the parking lot!  At that point, we both agreed no matter how good the food was,  we were not willing to wait in the parking lot of a restaurant.  We were extremely disappointed and ended up getting some Mexican food and taking it back to our hotel room and watching television.\n\nThanks, Petite Maison for a wonderful 10 year wedding anniversary dinner memory.
