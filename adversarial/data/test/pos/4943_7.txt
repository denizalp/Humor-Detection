Food was bland, service was slow but ambience is casual.  We stopped in for breakfast, order a few daily specials, and a pancakes and egg plate.  First off I ordered a cappuccino and what came out was coffee and foam.  Breakfast plate came out but food was not to good.  It was just okay, but for the price I'd suggest venturing somewhere else.
