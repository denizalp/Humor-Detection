I recently went to Physio First to have an injured shoulder treated. This was my first time seeing a physiotherapist and Physio First was recommended by my doctor.\n\nFrom the very first visit, I felt very comfortable with the professional service. I was treated by Chris Henderson, a registered physiotherapist and one of the owners, and was impressed with how quickly my shoulder improved.\n\nEach visit consisted of a thorough assessment of the mobility and condition of my injured shoulder followed by some exercises. Before I even got home, I had an email from Physio First with my next appointment reminder and the detailed exercises to do at home.\n\nIf you're looking for a quality physiotherapist in the Bloor\/Islington area, look no further.
