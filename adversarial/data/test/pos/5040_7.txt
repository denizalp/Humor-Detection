Summerlin is like home and I love this community. I was thus thrilled to see Downtown Summerlin develop. This cute shopping center is fun and has something for everyone. I love walking around here. They've got several places to shop at from a Nordstroms Rack to a Dillards to an Apple Store. They've also got several yummy eateries like a Shake Shack.\n\nI really enjoy walking around here because it's not so crowded. I also like how you can find almost anything and every thing in terms of shopping or eating. Summerlin has always been special and I'm so glad to see such a special shopping center in the area. I'm looking forward to shopping and dining here more!
