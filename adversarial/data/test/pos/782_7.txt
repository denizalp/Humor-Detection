I will never go to another waxing salon. I moved across the country and then moved back to Vegas. Honestly, I think I moved back for the Pretty Kitty! I just have never found another waxing salon like it. Their website says they use a \"proprietary\" soft wax, and I believe that they do. There is just something about it. The soft wax, combined with the skill and quick work of the technician, makes the waxing virtually painless. I HATE salons that use hard wax...I feel the rip, rip, ripping to get the wax to come off and time it takes makes it almost unbearable (unBAREable?! Haha). I love I am in and out of Pretty Kitty in 15 minutes and on my way. I have been waxing for many years and the Pretty Kitty is definitely the best place around.
