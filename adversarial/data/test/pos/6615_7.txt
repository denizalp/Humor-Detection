There's nothing wrong with having a bottle of wine at 10 am, right? Right?\n\nNot if you're having brunch at Bouchon. (And, apparently, not if you're lushes like Jim G. and I are!)\n\nThe bistro is beautiful and instantly made me want to return to Paris. Our server was nice, albeit a little slow at times.  We started with some coffee (flavorful and tasty) and the Baguette which comes with butter, jam (homemade and fresh) and nutella.  Yum!  You also get bread with the meal (which I didn't know), so maybe you don't need the baguette, but I liked having both a french baguette (it's small) and the sourdough bread.\n\nProceeded to order the:\nChicken and Waffles for me: So flavorful!! Moist, crispy skin roast half chicken; so succulent!  Chive and bacon infused waffles; yes please!  This is the upscale version of Roscoe's!!!\nSteak Frites for Jim G: not a cheap version of steak frites, but a full on hunk of steak, hence the necessity for wine!\n\nEverything was so good and filling!  I would go there again in a minute!  Bear in mind, the Chicken and Waffles is only available on the weekend and it is their most popular dish!
