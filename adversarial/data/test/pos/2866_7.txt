Each time I try to find a AYCE sushi buffet in Vegas that can live up to my standard (Goyemon), I fail miserably. Ono had just opened up and recently offered a 30% off opening weekend discount. We missed this by a day, but snagged the 10% off with Yelp check-in. AYCE dinner was $25. \n\nThe menu had a multitude of starters to choose from including bulgogi fries (soggy), and a number of yakitori to choose from. You're limited to 1 skewer per person, but I enjoyed the mushroom option.\n\nAs for the nigiri, they have your standard fare, with the exception of quail egg, which I thought was more unique. One time orders included the ocean trout (which we never received), uni, amaebi (sweet shrimp with separate head presented fried), and oyster when seasonably available. Disappointingly, they were mostly out of the salmon belly nigiri except for one order (which was tasty). More unforgivable was the fact that many some of the fish came served with bones and even scales still attached. I've never experienced this before at a sushi restaurant, even for an AYCE place. We tried one specialty roll, the baked salmon, which was not at all what we imagined and I'm not sure if it was even exactly baked. \n\nFor dessert, the ice cream was rock hard. They were also out of the lychee sorbet and most of the mochi. Also if there is such a thing as too much service. The number of table touches by our waiter was borderline interruptive to both our meal and our conversation. Hopefully this was just a case of growing pains from a new restaurant and they improve, but not worth the cost of AYCE IMO.
