When I walk into a barber shop, lazily non-maintained jew-fro in tow, I usually expect to see the electric clippers come out right away.  No questions about style - just \"how short would you like your buzz?\"\n\nThat's why I usually save my twenty bucks for a conciliatory meal afterwards, and shave my own head.\n\nNew York, New York is different, though.  They actually styled my hair.  While I watched Russian television.  I'm not sure what style I would call it, but it looked - professional!\n\nNice haircut and a shave for $20 plus tip - not bad at all.
