Why did one beer + an angry orchard with fireball cost me $23?! I get it, it's a strip club... but damn. You'll get my money one way or another, why take it all at the bar? Unless you stick to the specials, don't bother trying to get your drink on here without breaking the bank. \n\nThe girls are mostly really nice and the talent isn't bad, minus the few girls who look absolutely pissed off to even be at work that day. I get that you can't be all smiles all the time but it's awkward to watch people who look miserable dance on stage. \n\nThe setup for the club isn't bad, but it's incredibly frustrating when large groups \"claim\" seats around the stage...we ended up standing awkwardly behind the railing near the buffet (which did smell amazing, but we didn't eat). \n\nThe ATMs were out of money by midnight, so that was also a downer. It seems like this place doesn't 100% work in the favor of the girls (high drink prices, no access to more cash), which is sad because they definitely work their ass off. \n\nOverall, this place really is great if your expectations aren't too high and you want a chill night to unwind. Next time we'll save our money for the breakfast bar and bring more cash on our own.  \n\nContrary to other posts, though, the girl at the front door is super sweet! She's only going to be a bitch if you're acting a fool... which I've seen and it's not pretty.
