Horrific and insulting behavior is what my Friend and I experienced by that little girl who calls herself a \"waitress\" with the my  don't stink attitude. That's okay because I'm Young and Retired  YOU still HAVE to get up and go to WORK  As for the food, My steak was not Worth $30.00, it was tasteless and freezer burned. I've had better steak in the ARMY, that's how bad that tasteless Boot Leather was. This was our FIRST and LAST time here.
