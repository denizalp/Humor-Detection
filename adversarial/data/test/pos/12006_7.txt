While it is obvious that one doesn't go to Subway to nosh on gourmet sandwiches, there are certain things one expects from the fast food chain experience. Stuff like consistency. Or, perhaps, not running out of stuff like... cheese or, all breads other than White. But that happens here, and it happens often. \n\nGranted, it's constantly busy. Located on the 2nd floor of the Robarts Library at U of T, there's always a huge line of hungry students (like myself) who are looking to scarf down a mediocre sandwich before continuing a long study slog. But, really, there's gotta be some way they can do some planning to find out how much bread\/cheese\/toppings they need on a daily basis. Stuff is ALWAYS running out there by 5pm. \n\nSpeaking of getting there by 5pm, if you're there past that time, take your food to go. It gets FILTHY in that food court by mid-afternoon. Wrappers, napkins, bottles EVERYWHERE: on the floor, on crumby tables, piling up around trash cans. Why the facilities don't have people there constantly is beyond me. \n\nBetter yet, bring a sandwich from home. It'll taste better.
