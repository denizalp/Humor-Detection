I always feel rebirthed after a visit to Body Blitz.  Something about soaking around in pools for a few hours that reminds me of the sweet, sweet womb.\n\nI received a gift certificate for Christmas for a 60 min. massage and a visit to the pools.  I made a last minute appt. the day before over the phone which was not a problem.\n\nI arrived about 1.5 hrs before my massage to soak my weary bones and followed the recommended circuit.  I noticed that the green tea pool has now been replaced by just an epson salt pool.\n\nSurprisingly, my favourite spot was the cold plunging pool.  Cool, but not freezing and perfect on a warm summer day.  I found the steam room to be too hot but loved the eucalyptus scent.  The infrared sauna was great too.\n\nThe massage, done by Vivian, was great.  Nice pressure, minimal conversations.\n\nJust a heads up if you're using a gift certificate for a massage - you will get a receipt from your RMT but not in your name, but in the name of the person who purchased your gift.
