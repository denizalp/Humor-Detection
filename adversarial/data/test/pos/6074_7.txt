As far as Yoga studios go, this one is very friendly, clean and welcoming. The reception tries to remember each persons name, which I really liked. The owner also called to ask how my first session was, and offered to answer any questions we had.I feel bad writing a not-so-great review because the studio experience really is great.\n\nMy real concern is with Bikram Yoga itself, for beginners. I practice Moksha yoga often and have never been hurt, strained a muscle, or felt so dizzy I had to leave. I tried Bikram out using a Groupon and within two days I had a sore back. The main differences between the two are that Bikram is hotter, longer, contains more breathing exercises, and often changes quickly between laying down and standing up. The instructors are a lot more intense too. The constant lying down and then getting up quickly to do a pose is (in my opinion) not safe in 40 degree heat. I felt dizzy for half the class and felt like I was about to have a panic attack my heart was beating so fast. I also twisted a lot of muscles trying to get to the poses in time. \n\nThere wasn't much help with correcting postures for beginners, or encouragement to control breathing while in a pose. At the end of 90 minutes the breathing exercise was very quick and fast, basically inviting people to hyperventilate and pass out. \n\nFYI this review is coming from a marathon runner who could barely survive a 90 minute class of Bikram.
