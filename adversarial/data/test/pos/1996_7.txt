Looking over all the rave reviews on this place and living so close, I figured there was nothing stopping me from trying out some fresh yummy donuts.  So, I dropped by after a long day at work.\n\nI ordered one raspberry filled and a Boston cream.  They were oh so soft, moist, sweet, and they melted in my mouth.  I've never tasted a donut like this before.  I couldn't think of comparing them to anyone else.  I literally wanted to fall to my knees and thank God for these scrumptious donuts.
