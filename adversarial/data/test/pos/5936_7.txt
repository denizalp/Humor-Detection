No one helps you, everyone doesn't know where anything is at. The staff do not know the definition of customer service.\n\nOne time I needed help but the two workers just kept talking among themselves even though they did see me standing there trying to talk to them. They were talking about their personal lives. How unprofessional. \n\nI really dread this wal-Matt and usually go in here for emergencies only. \n\nIf I could put negative stars I would.
