This bar... well, it's location, epitomizes reincarnation. I first went here when it was Nasty Habits in the early 2000s... then it became TNT, then the Locker Room and now Ice Pics. It isn't a landmark like Amsterdam or Charlie's, but it does draw a crowd. It's cozy and intimate, though it is pretty dark inside. It's much more conducive to meeting people than those aforementioned bars. I have to really give them credit for allowing the philanthropic Grand Canyon Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence to do frequent fundraisers on bingo nights. The bingo nights change themes frequently. I like it for its comfort and relaxed atmosphere.
