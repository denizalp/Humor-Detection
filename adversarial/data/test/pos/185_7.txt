WOW!! WOW! WOW! WOW!! \n\nI could type WOWS ALLLLLLL day long =) Okay so we parked in the garage right next to the museum and as we were walking towards the front doors we ran in to 2 DIFFERENT families with kids crying they didn't want to leave! Okay so I LOVE seeing others reactions to gauge how the experience was and well HELLO kids loving it? I was SOOO excited for my daughter! As soon as we walked in an saw the 4 story play place she was shaking like a chihuahua with excitement. We payed $12 each and asked if we could upgrade to the year membership before we leave. They told us to hang on to the reciept. \n\nFirst things first my daughter and I went for the play place! Each level had different themes and things for my 3y\/o to play with! We just kept climbing and climbing....eventually losing my husband lol. I decided on the 2nd floor we'd go back down and meet up with Hubby, who was with my son. We ventured into the water room and went crazy!!! Even my almost 1yo son had fun in here!! We took the kids on over to Toddler Town where they have a crawling area for kids UNDER 18 months and my son went crazy with all the different textures and toys and mirrors and speed bumps! My daughter played mining and could even finger paint! I stayed with my son while Hubby took my daughter to the pirate ship to play dress up! I rejoined them in time for her to dress like a princess and visit the castle.\n\nTime for the 2nd level. PRETEND TOWN! For real it has a Wells Fargo, Jamaba Juice, Smiths, vet's office, a construction site, and an auto garage! My daugheter played in every single one....TWICE! The other side half of the 2nd floor is the nutrition zone which I will be able to explore more next time. They also have a George Washington exhibit goin on which was pretty interesting! \n\nI cant remember if the arts and crafts room was on the 2nd or 3rd floor either way my daughet got to paint and then color a cardboard square to be made into her own PUZZLE!  The 3rd floor definitely houses the air current area and physics area as well as CSI town. \n\nAll in all as we were leaving we purchased year passes!! We went for the Discovery Memebership and we might even be having her birthday here! I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest taking kids ages 6months-10 years here!!
