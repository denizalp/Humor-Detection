I stopped by the Chipotle location at Yonge\/Dundas for a quick bite and my burrito experience was mediocre at best. It was soggy and sloppy, and the person that prepared my burrito looked like they wanted to die (this negative energy probably transferred itself directly to my burrito).\n\nI could make a much better burrito at home with frozen or jarred ingredients. It was honestly bland and incredibly sloppy to eat - the damn thing was falling apart from the moment I unwrapped it.
