I'm a big fan of the Brass Armadillo Antique Mall and was ecstatic when I learned that a second location was opening in the Valley! (The other location is near Cactus and I-17.)\n\nThis Brass Armadillo location is super HUGE!!!!!!! It occupies like 42,000 square feet which makes it the LARGEST antique mall in Arizona! It is nestled between Lowe's and JCPennys, just North of I-10 and West of Dysart. Easy to find and lots of parking!\n\nThe staff are quite friendly, the prices are very reasonable (there are hundreds of multiple dealers under one roof, which means LOTS of merchandise to see), FREE coffee, vending machines with inexpensive snacks and beverages (where else can you buy a bag of chips for .50 cents????), convenient restrooms, efficient check-out, and a vast variety of vintage wares, antiques, and cool collectibles.\n\nWear comfy shoes, there is a lot to see!\n\nI am finding excellent deals here and haven't left empty handed with each visit. \n\nI visit a lot of antique malls and junk shops around the Valley, but the Brass Armadillo is my overall favorite!
