Sometimes low expectations are where it's at.\nProbably not worth the 4 stars for everyone but i've only ever had good times here.\nThis is kind of the strangest divey bar - a bit of anachronism on King West.\n\nI stumbled to this bar more than a few times not even knowing it was the same place until I saw the less than awesome decor.  The people were a strange mix of college kids, hostel kids (there's one right across the street) and cruisers with popped collars.  and the music isn't all that danceable (aka pop) with sort of a rock-ish tilt to it.  WHY the four stars?  I don't know, to tell you the truth.  partly because I've never had a bad time here and partly beacuse I feel I need to bring the avg up.\n\nTrue that the bottom bar pales in comparison tot he top dance area.  So try not to end up at the bottom bar.  You might end up giving this place a 2\/5 yourself if you do.\n\nThis ain't as bad as you think it is.  This TYPE of bar almost reminds of croc rock- it's kind of the place you end up at even though you try hard to be creative and try someplace different.  and by the end of the night you wonder why you didnt' want to end up there in the first place because you actualyl had a kickass time. \n\nAlso similar to croc rock- don't expect a good time and you will inevitably have a good time.
