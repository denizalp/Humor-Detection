Before I get to the food, etc. I made an observation here that was quite disturbing from an infection control perspective. The young woman wiping down the tables was using the same rag to wipe both table tops and seats without even rinsing the rag between surfaces. Ideally, she should have two separate rags--one for table tops and one for seats. The thought of smearing e. coli from the seats onto the eating surface was creepy. \n\nThis is a hybrid grocery store and sit-down restaurant. The decor is sparse and be careful when walking in the dining area for unlevel surfaces (a mix of vinyl and ceramic tile making for different height walking surfaces). When I entered I was told to sit anywhere. The only two booths that were open had crumbs and food debris on both the table and seat (but once I saw how these surfaces are cleaned, I was just as happy to not have these surfaces \"cleaned\").\n\nI had the chicken kabob sandwich ($4.50) and it had plenty of grilled chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and tahini sauce in a soft pita. It was tasty. I also got some very good walnut baklava to go ($7.99 per pound). The server drops the check at your table and you pay at the cash register as you leave. A single cash register handles both the grocery and restaurant portions of the business.\n\nParking is very tight and the parking lot is laid out weird, so careful backing up. Would I go here again? The food was tasty and reasonably priced (4 stars), but I don't think I can handle the thought of eating off a surface that been \"cleaned\" with the same rag used to clean the places where people park their buttocks (minus 2 stars).
