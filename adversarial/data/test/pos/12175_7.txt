My man's mom used to hang out here in high school and this is the pizza he grew up on, which I think in part explains his awesomeness. If I had grown up on this pizza I'd be cooler. The pepperoni is fat strips of cured beef on top of the cheese like yo, this is how we do it and your insides can just weep and deal with it. We had friends over and ordered this pizza and it sent them home to bed with their heads spinning. Not for the faint of heart, but truly excellent for what it is.
