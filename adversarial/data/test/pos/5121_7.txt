For the hell of it, we swung by here shortly before they closed. 'Twas hoppin' as usual on a warm summer South Hills Friday night. \n\nI can only imagine what this place would be like if it were around in 1988. Anyways...\n\nI tried a choco-vanilla swirl in a cup with hot fudge this time.\n\nIt's like BUTTA! \n\nBut bear in mind I prefer Tarja Turunen and Angela Gossow over Babs. \n\nTalk amongst yerselves.
