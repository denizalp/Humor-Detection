Church's has way better food than KFC, in both selection and flavor, not to mention a better price.\nThis one is a small store that gets busy, so they are a little slow at times.\nThe crew at this Church's is hard working, and there are never any quality issues.\nThe honey-butter biscuits are better than the other guy's too, but they recently stopped having packets of honey available for dripping over them (they say they have more honey cooked onto the biscuit now).
