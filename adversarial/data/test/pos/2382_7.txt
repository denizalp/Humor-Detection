Drove from Scottsdale out to cabelas to buy a new gun, a 45 minute drive, had card in hand to pay. Showed up and the only guy working the gun counter was talking to some gun nut about some caliber preference. Just sitting there bullshitting, the guy didn't even want to buy anything. So we wait in line and  30 minutes later closing time is nearing. And they let us know that the gun counter is closed and they won't be doing any more sales. I'm pretty mad. So I ask to speak to a manager and it becomes abundantly clear that cabelas does not give a fuck about the average customer. Not even an apology or anything. All they want to do is sit there and circle jerk about what is better a 9mm or 45. They will never get any business from me and everyone I've ever told my tale too has similar complaints.
