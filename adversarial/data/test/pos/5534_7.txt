We stopped by very quickly for custard tarts to snack on (2 regular, 2 chocolate chip). This place is located at a plaza right by Cawthra Road and Burnhamthorpe Road, in the same plaza as Marconi Pizza.\n\nOverall, the tarts weren't bad but weren't the best (I preferred the natas from Caldense Bakery). The filling was eggier and creamier than most, and the pastry\/crust wasn't crispy and very, very slightly soggy. It was acceptable, and the chocolate chip natas were quite sweet and delicious - but not the best I've had.\n\nWhen I'm in the area again, I'll stop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way to specifically visit.
