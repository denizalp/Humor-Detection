Sugar. Oil. Sugar. Oil. Sugar. Oil....\n\nI try hard to review places based on how well they do what they're trying to do... and not just my own enjoyment.\n\nFor example... in this case, if I was eating at a dive bar, the amount of oil soaking my burger bun, and amount of sugar mixed with my Brussels sprouts --while not pleasing to my pallete-- would have been accepted.\n\nHowever, it isnt a dive bar... this place is going for the gastro-pub hip-American-new eatery... and if that's the theme, I need a LOT more from the kitchen. \n\nResorting to covering savory dishes in sugar, and smothering everything in oil is a culinary cop out...\n\nStaff was professional and decor was awesome. The idea is right... but the dishes are just missing.
