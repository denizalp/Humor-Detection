Yay, I'm a fan, and I didn't drink! Several of my friends were going, and I wasn't doing anything, and I really dont like beer, so I volunteered to be the DD. So, April D, Anthony M, David S and Mark B could drink all they wanted and I would get them home safely!\nWorked out fantastic for me, I got treated to dim sum lunch at Cathay House (thanks again David S!), treated to the festival (thank you Anthony M) and had Taco y Taco for dinner (thank you Mark B!). April treated us all to some gut busting laughs afterwards at Taco y Taco. \n\nThis years festival was downtown. I really love when they close off the streets and you can walk around like you own the place! Upon arrival, there was a HUGE line. Like, intimidatingly long line, but no worries, it moved quickly. I am not sure what the tickets prices were, but for me, being the designated driver, it was $20 bucks (you get free water...but so did everyone else, lol!)\n\nWhen you first enter, you pass the food trucks, the food \"court\" area and all the local beers. Going in towards La Comida (who I heard catered a buffet for the VIP'S) that's where the stage was, and all of the other beer vendors.\n\nIt was pretty crowded by the end of the night, and the lines were long, but everyone was so chill throughout the day. No fights, no yelling, and no obviosuly wasted people (ya know, stumbling around...swaying like they are on a boat....none of that. At least that I saw).\n\nWalking around the festival, ran into some other very awesome Yelpers. Hey there Traci T, what up Teri W and it's been so damn long Stephanie S! Oh, and also hung out for a bit with Kart P! Tien and his friend Millie also joined us, but only for a little while. They....I'm sure not what happened. But they didn't stay to long.\n\nCan't tell you much about the beers, but it was a really good time with great people. I'd be the DD for this anytime! (and I dont charge or expect anything....except good times!).\n\nIt was a great day spent with wonderful people. I look forward to next years event!
