I've been getting my hair done by Mas'oud at this salon on and off for few years with fantastic results. The only reason I have at times struggled coming back is the price, alternative being my second favorite, less expensive Cooney for Hair. Well, I have now decided that amazing quality and 100% consistency is worth the price. Other attractions are the upbeat energy of this place and amazing personality of my stylist. All these combined never cease to put me in a great mood that lasts long after I left the salon. At such times I can relate to what women mean when they say \"I'm having a great hair day\" ...I think.
