I wanted to get my hair colored so I found this place through Yelp. Thanks all the Yelpers for leaving such useful reviews! I had a fantastic experience and hair color :-)\nThe stylist lady that did my hair (sorry... forgot to get her name) did miracle on my hair. I have very coarse, thick, strong hair so it's very hard for the color to get in my hair. Every hair colorist I've had in the past had very hard time dying my hair. She made sure I was satisfied and worked on my hair very carefully every step.\nThe owner, Maria is super sweet and kind :-) She was making sure everyone in the salon was happy and giving the other stylists advice. I saw her cutting two ladies hair and they both came out drop dead gorgeous. She is a platform hair stylist! If I'd want a hair cut, I would definitely go with Maria! Oh, also ella habla espa√±ol so that's a plus.\nAlso, they have Kerastase fusio dose. Not many salons have fusio dose (in Vegas). So if your hair is really weak and damaged, it's worth coming here just to get fusio dose done here. I think it's the best thing you can do for your hair.\nThe price was very reasonable for what I got done today! I'm a happy camper ;-) Thank you!
