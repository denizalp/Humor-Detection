So  many bad reviews but I actually liked my experience here.\n\nI purchased a Groupon here for a Brazilian wax and made an appointment for 4pm. \nI arrived promptly on time but was greeted by no one. After waiting a little, a lady (I'm pretty sure she was the owner) said hello and told me to wait a little as she got everything ready. As I waited, another customer came in and told her she needed a threading so she did her first (I was not pleased). She also picked up a few phone calls and did an phone interview with a potential employee before she got to me.\n\nIt was finally my turn at 4:20pm. The waxing room seemed clean and smelled nice. The towels were a little worn but it didn't bother me much. She left me to get ready. When she came back, she assured me that the door was locked and started the wax. It was pretty typical for a brazillian. There was the usual discomfort but nothing different from other places. The wax was just the right temperature and she did everything very swiftly and professionally. As she did the waxing she talked to me about my hobbies to distract me and 10 minutes later we were done. \n\nAfter I got dressed I gave her my Groupon and she gave me a 40% off card for the next time I come because I had to wait. That was definitely nice of her. (She also mentioned that there's a student discount.)\n\nThe place looks more like a nail salon than a waxing place\/spa but it doesn't bother me. The lady was very professional and very comforting. I'm happy with the results and I will be back for sure.
