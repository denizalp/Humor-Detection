This is a newly opened computer store in the heart of Corso Italia.  It is very similar to the computer shops at College and Spadina, think Factory Direct, Filtech, Fortune Computer.... Etc. \n\nThey sent a mailer out to the nearby neighborhood with deals on refurbished computer screens, USB keys, cables and accessories.  \n\nI went to the store to purchase the 12 foot HDMI cable for $6.99 as per the flyer. It was easy to find and the staff person provided friendly service. However, I found it out that the person did not know the price and he had to reference they flyer that I brought in.  Strange. What if I didn't bring the flyer?\n\nIt was still a pleasant transaction though. The person also talked about their other services such as cell phone and computer repair. \n\nI will be back to get the next deal!
