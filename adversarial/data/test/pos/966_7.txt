WHAT WAS THIS......\n\nUmmm I have never really walked out on too many resteruants... but this was DEFINITELY one I could not stick around to continue.... =[ maybe it was a bad night... but one bad moment is a big turn off for me....\n\nWe weren't really greeted the server just kind of stared at us... then she came around & sat us... & was just a bit akward. No smile... no expression... no words really... she came around & got our order as we wanted to do AYCE. \n\nOur first order came out and it was tuna wrapped around fried fish can't remember the name since the hubby ordered it... but a few minutes later a couple of our sushi pieces came out & literally I smelt a stench of fish...\n\nHONESTLY fresh raw fish should NOT smell or have a STENCH of fish!!! But I thought maybe it was just one of the fishes on the plate so I ate my HALIBUT first & I couldn't swallow it.... =[ \nThen I turned the plate to have the hubby try... & the was a piece of short hair on the sushi.... !!!! O_o  then a salmon roll came out & that was all for my man but he put one roll in & then he spit it out... he said the rice was like MUSH in his mouth... rarely does he complain too much about food he just eats.... but if he can't handle.. BLAHHH \n\nSeen some good reviews... but OMG I feel like I was totally tricked.... so we couldn't.. we told them to stop all orders... & WORST thing was.. when we showed the waitress the hair she said she will get a new one.. but right as I decided I can't eat here I went up to where she took the plate back... the chef was just placing the same fishes on a DIFFERENT plate... \n\nSORRY but that was a sign I will NOT try this place again... =\\
