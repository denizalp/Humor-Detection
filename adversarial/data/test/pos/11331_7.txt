Guess I was pretty lucky that there were only a few people in line when I decided to try Uncle Tetsu's. You can only buy one cheesecake at a time, and then you get in line again for another one. This can be really annoying if you just want two and have to wait again. But luckily I am just one person. \n\nJapanese Cheesecake is not at all like what I am used to. I was sort of expecting the richness of American Cheesecake, and instead got the lightness of angel food cake with a touch of cream cheese. Very different texture. Less dessert-like. Very airy. I can definitely say I've never had anything like it. \n\nFor $10\/cheesecake, it's a pretty good value. The cheesecakes aren't large, but you can easily get four huge slices or 6 reasonable slices out of it. I didn't try the madeleines, but I heard those were pretty good. Next time, silly stomach!
