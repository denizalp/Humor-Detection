I'm really liking the Wynn these last few years. I came here years ago to see Avenue Q, then back for Le Reve, returned to stay here when in town for the Rock N Roll marathon a couple years ago and most recently this weekend to get out of town. The Venetian and Bellagio used to be my go-to hotels, but it feels like I may have jumped ship to the Wynn. \n\nThis hotel is lovely, the people are lovely, the crowd is nice- you don't get the random questionable riff raff you get at some of the other non tolerable casino\/hotels on the strip, the casino is great. I'm loving the electronic Roulette machine. \n\nWe've stayed here on two separate visits and both times have been great experiences. Our room is always extremely comfortable and welcoming. I love the TV's in the bathroom, the products are high quality, water pressure is perfection, the bed is super luxurious, sofa is great - absolutely no complaints.\n\nI will say, with the Venetian I often feel there is a bit more at my finger tips (dining, shopping, etc.) than the Wynn, but this is still an Excellent choice! \n\nWe have had the buffet before and missed dining at Andrea's this go around due to timing with our show but will definitely return soon and experience more of their dining options.\n\nTheir new Jeff Koon's Popeye is probably one of my most favorite pieces of his. We really enjoyed seeing it on this visit. \n\nThe Wynn is gorgeous. It's surely one of the best options in Vegas and I can't wait to return.
