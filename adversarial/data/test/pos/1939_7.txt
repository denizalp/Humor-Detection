Didn't see Dr. Cook but the PA which was fine as he was very helpful knowledgeable.   I'll go back in 4 weeks but seems like my squat and lunges days are done. Probably body weight stuff, swimming bicycling extensions etc.  Went the u my pictures and finally understand them.  Very good orthopedic care!!
