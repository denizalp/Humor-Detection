My recent pictures definitely prove I've been desserting too much. Just kidding -- there's no such thing as too much dessert.\n\nChurn has an old-fashioned ice cream parlor feel to it, minus the seating. There is backyard seating, but it's limited and shared with the restaurant next door. Churn has a tiny storefront with a counter and limited choices of flavors. I've been there twice in the past few months a few weeks apart, and the flavors don't seem to have changed. Good flavors though, but limited selection. Sugar cones, waffle cones, and even pretzel cones are offered. The waffle cone is my favorite so far, although I haven't tried the pretzel cone yet.\n\nOne standout thing about Churn is how huuuuge their scoops are. Their single scoop equates to at least 1.5 regular scoops at other ice cream places I've been to, and they offer a kiddie scoop that's more than enough for me. \n\nMy favorite flavor so far has been vietnamese coffee, although the strawberry comes a close second. My friends have liked the cherry pie, chocolate, and buttered pecan. I wasn't a fan of the buttered pecan because of how heavy it was, but the chocolate was decently good. I would've preferred the strawberry to be a tad more strawberry and touch less cream, but the fresh strawberry taste came through. The first time I got the vietnamese coffee, it was strong and creamy and decadent. The second time, however, it was a bit more watery and not as thick. It was still good, just not as good as I'd remembered. \n\nChurn is a good option for solid, traditional flavors (with one or two adventurous twists for the daredevils out there), but its claim to fame is really the ginormous scoops. But do try the waffle cone; it's pretty darn good.
