I came in with a work group on a Tues night. The staff admitted that they were unusually busy, but to me, it looked like a normal-sized crowd for a large restaurant. Granted, I'm from NYC.\n\nAnyway, they told us it would be a 45min wait for a table. 10min later, a table opened up, but the hostess didn't tell us. We just went and sat ourselves.\n\nI went to tell a server and the hostess we were seated; they said they'll get to us when they can. Perhaps 30min later, the server arrived and took our orders. Drinks showed up 30min afterward, and then food came 45min afteward-- and the food orders were wrong. Some items were missing.\n\nNow, for the food: it was crap. It was horrible, really, considering the location and the hype and the wait. Essentially, the chefs here go for the \"just use tons of fat, sugar, and salt\" style of American cooking.\n\nOverall, it was a terrible experience, from the wait to the service to the food.
