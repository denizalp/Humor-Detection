First of all, if you call they want you to make an appointment (even though they take walk ins). The last time I went in, I had an appointment, but I still waited 25 mins, before they gave me a seat for pedi. Then I sat in that water (which became ICE COLD) for 45 mins. I seriously was getting up to leave, when the girl finally sat down to start my feet. \nWhen they finally got to my hands (over the phone I was told $20 for nails) she began taking off the polish, with the drill type tool. Then she filled and said \"you want polish? That $20\". Well of course I want polish, lol. As she started working on my cuticles, I had tears from the tremendous pain I was in, as she used the SAME DRILL!!! It was like someone was burning my fingers with a lighter. It hurt so badly it was almost unbearable. Then she painted. My nails looked awful and the cuticles were bleeding. Oh AND AFTER she painted them, she filed them! So my polish looked chipped Walking out the door. All said and done I paid $80!!!! I got the basic pedi, mani refill, and polish. Plus my tip. It was not deserved but I wouldn't feel right leaving without a tip. I do NOT recommend this place. I found a place that does a much better job and charges me LESS than half the price for both feet and hands.
