the griffin has a great medieval times\/ dungeon and dragons-esque atmosphere. dark, brooding, with great music to boot. the crowd is also \"down to earth\" and looks more like a local watering hole for resident navadians as oppose to the \"what happens in vegas, stays in vegas\" crowd that you will get if you were drinking on the strip. \n\ngreat bar for a night of drinking or socializing with your friends. OR make the griffin one of the stops during your bar crawl.
