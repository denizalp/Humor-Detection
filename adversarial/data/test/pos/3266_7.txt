Went here for the first time last night with a party of 6. We were told a pretty accurate wait time, so no issues about that. The service was horrible and the food was nothing spectacular. My boyfriend ordered the surf and turf. He ordered it medium rare and it was rare. He did not send it back, so maybe that's on us. But the rice pilaf on both of our dishes wasn't very appealing or appetizing at that. Secondly, the service. Our waitress was late on everything. Drink refills=NOT GOOD. We observed other tables having to get up and get their own drinks! The food from order to serve was long and it all came out at different times. I really DISLIKE that scenario- especially with 4 or more people. Please bring everything out at the same time. Do they not have trays??? Am I crazy to think we should all be served at the same time?? Lastly, there was an issue with gift cards we purchased from Sam's club. They claimed that one did not have any balance on it. How could that be possible, they were just purchased? The waitress even claimed she tried it several times with witness of her manager. I believe her but how come the manager didn't come out to tell us? Upon further review of the gift cards and receipts, I noticed that she apparently was trying to use one twice. DUH! I had 4. She didn't think to audit the numbers to see which ones she had swiped and which ones would be left? So apparently that's why she was getting a declined notice back. She was trying to swipe one twice. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out-- well maybe it does and I work with rocket scientists!! At any rate. It was my first and last visit. With all of these issue, never saw a manager, wasn't impressed with the food and the service wasn't any better than a McDonalds. I wouldn't recommend wasting any time, money or energy at this place!
