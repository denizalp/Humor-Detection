Do people only rate because of food and forget about service? I am really upset because I came here based on people's review. I am on vacation, and since I came with my family, they wanted some authentic Viet food. \n\nWhen we first arrived it was 12:06. The restaurant was supposed to open at 12. The guy opened the door and did not greet us. He didn't even seat us. He was so damn grouchy. Just because you're a grown man does not mean you could act however you like. At least respect my parents and say something in Viet! Is all service in Toronto Chinatown this rude that people give it such a high rating? Ok, enough of me yapping about the poor service here comes the food.\n\n\nWe wanted to eat family style, but like usual, I'm an outcast and ordered Pho. I won't deny it, the Pho was delicious. It could even be compared to the Pho So 1 in Dorchester, which is my favorite. \n\nMy family ordered,\nCa ro: fishy to death! I am not lying, this was so fishy that it was so difficult to eat. My family loves fish, my dad is from the South and is a fisherman, but this fish was on another level of FISHY, the type you want to spit out and barf \nCanh chua ca bong: Again, we are a fish fan, but not only that we care about the broth. Canh chua is supposed to taste sour because of the tamarind, however we did not taste any tamarind at all\nStir fry chicken: The chicken was extremely dry, dry to the point where when you eat it you either drink water, or you'll choke to death inside the restaurant\n\nThis is the worse Vietnamese restaurant experience ever. My parents came out really disappointed, my brother constantly complained because he hated it that much. I waited to complain on yelp.
