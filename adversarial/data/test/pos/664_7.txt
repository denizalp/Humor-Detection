\"Wait, where are you guys taking me again?  Why am I in this dark lit alley?\"\n\nWelcome to Sole. \n\nLooks totally sketchy on the inside, but looks totally fine inside. We were here for a birthday party for about 20-30 people and it worked out fine.  \n\nItching to sing some BSB? They have that too. \nKorean pop? Mando pop?  It's all there.\n\nMake sure to order the yogurt soju when you get there. Sweet, but potent.\n\n4 stars.
