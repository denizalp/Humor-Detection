on this particular night, we originally had dinner rezzies over at The Estate House just down the street... but i was so strongly turned off by their hostess\/wait staff hanging around up front when we walked in the front door there, that i convinced my group to leave.(and i've NEVER done that before in my life, which tells you how unacceptable it was)\n\nsince i'm fairly new in town, someone else in our group suggested we go to Bandera instead. everyone else unanimously agreed and then proceeded to rave on about how much i would like it. \n\nwe walked in, and were greeted by a professional and warm staff. it was so refreshing, in comparison to the place we had just left. since we didn't have reservations at Bandera, and it was a saturday night, we had a short wait. no problem, cocktails up at the bar anyone? \n\nthere seemed to a tiny bit of a scene going on up at the bar... or, uh, rather what scottsdale *attempts* as a scene i guess. haha i mean, who doesn't enjoy looking at pretty people? even if they're trying way too hard to mimic what they think LA people are doing. *sigh* but i digress, back to the cocktails. made just the way i like them. the bartender was also great at handling the large crowd hovering around her while keeping glasses filled until our table was called.\n\nnow this is where my love for Bandera started to drop. the menu wasn't exactly exciting.... however, if you're in the mood for a southwest\/tex mex style cuisine, this place is definitely for you.(it's just not my thing) everyone at our table insisted i would *love* the cornbread appetizer served in a hot skillet, so we ordered that. it was tasty for sure, but not mind blowing or anything... \n\nfor dinner the only thing that even remotely appealed to me on their menu was the filet (when in doubt, go with the steak i always say) which came with a side of grilled mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes. um, the steak was fine, but the veggies and mashers were just ok. not bad, but nothing special.\n\nhappily, the service was consistently great throughout the entire night. they kept our drinks filled, and never made us feel rushed or that they were irritated with our requests.\n\nno one ordered dessert, but we all stayed around a little to chat over one last cocktail before finally closing out our tab.\n\nwe left in great moods.\n\nwould i go out of my way to come back? probably not, but i can see the appeal of this place to others. not all of us love southwest\/tex mex food, but for those who do, you'll truly enjoy the experience here.
