Tried a new breakfast place....wasn't impressed.  Here are the pluses:  The wait to get a table was quick.   The wait staff were courteous and attentive.  Ok, now the negatives:  The coffee was lukewarm and bland.  The wait for the food was over 20 minutes.  The food was subpar.  I had to send my waffle back, because it was far from cooked through.  It looked like it was on the waffle iron for 60 seconds.  The bacon..one slice was almost burnt and the other still \"oinking\".  The biscuits and gravy were a nice portion (the half order) but the gravy was too salty for my liking.  Again, the food was lukewarm at best.  I was also concerned that the soap in the bathroom had been watered down.  Are the owners so cheap they would risk staff and customers not having proper soap?  Won't be back.  :\/
