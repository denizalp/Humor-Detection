This was the first time I had been to KFC since perhaps my high school years and now I know why:\n\nFood: C-   I had the 'Big Crunch' sandwich. First of all it wasn't really crunchy in a good way, it was crunchy in a hurt-your-jaw kind of way. Secondly, it really wasnt that big either considering that half of it was weird \"crunchy\" batter\/chicken skin. Lastly, the chicken tasted really weird, not sure what it was but it was bad enough that I couldn't eat any more than half the sandwich. \n\nService: Quick (lived up to the fast food name, but there was no one else there)\n\nFood presentation: B-  \n\nAtmosphere: D  This place doesn't even have any seats!\n\nPrices: B+  Pretty cheap but who cares if you can't even finish it.\n\nRecommended?:  Is that a serious question?
