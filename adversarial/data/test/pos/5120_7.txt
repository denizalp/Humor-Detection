Everyone's so nice. Our waitress was so friendly. \n\nBut here's the thing...the food is disgusting. They give you free stale chips and salsa. In our group we had ordered tortas, camarones rancheros, and fish. The tortas were uh interesting to look at that's for sure, the bread was burnt and the meat was red..I've had tortas in the past plenty of times and I've never seen any like the one I had here, after we left the restaurant I was really scared I was going to get food poisoning. \n\nMy brother had the fried fish..it was flavorless. Tasted like absolutely nothing. \n\nThe camarones rancheros were the absolute worst. The situation was almost laughable because they were so bad. Camarones rancheros are usually spicy and flavorful. These were just cooked in tomato sauce and onion. That's it! No flavor at all. When I asked the waitress if they were supposed to be like this she said yeah and that these were the best, I knew she was lying. The rice and beans that came with it weren't good either. \n\nWe half a** ate our food, we payed, we left. \n\nWhen we got in the car my little brother told us that when he went to the bathroom OUR waitress was in there cleaning the bathrooms, and she asked him to go under the stall and unlock it because it was locked from the inside. Why the freak was our waitress, the person that gave us our FOOD and DRINKS be cleaning the bathrooms?! Gross. AND why the freaking freak would she think it's appropriate to ask my younger brother to get on his hands and knees to get under the stall?!?!? I was just in shock. \n\nNEVER EVER going back. \n\nThe only reason we went to this restaurant was because they had ok reviews on yelp but nope, I don't recommend it to anyone.
