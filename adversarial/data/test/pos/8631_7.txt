Shut Up And Drink.\nI'd wager we roll into the DD 12 to 15 times a year.\n\nAlways a great experience.\nIt's not a Gay club though it's located near a few.\n\nBe open minded it may be R flirting with X rated at times.\n\nThe video poker is fair. Wife hit a really big jackpot,, but doesn't remember.\nWord from the DD regulars is they since tightened up the odds of winning to a 26% rake. That's brutal.\n\nYou will meet an interesting crowd here.\nNice college garage band rocker vibe.\nPuke insurance is $20, or you puke you clean it up.
