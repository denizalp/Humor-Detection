Well... what can I say. We give this place 3 stars because we like the idea and it's brand new - but we were a bit disappointed.\n\nThe food itself was alright. Just not really what we expected. In my opinion you're not offering the right kind of sausage for the Currywurst. (I was somewhat horrified by the idea of having a Weißwurst, so I took the Bratwurst) Also, Currywurst is really all about the sauce and it just wasn't spectacular. And there needs to be plenty of sauce!\n\nWe also tried a Dönerteller and a Döner. It was fine but not enough food for what you pay.\nThe beer selection is nice but somewhat random. I highly doubt that guys in Berlin wash down their sausages with a Paulaner. \n\nIt was nice sitting outside in the sun with a cold drink, so if you're just looking for a quick bite and a beer, you'll probably like it!
