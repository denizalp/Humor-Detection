I like fired pie, I like the concept and I like the price!  $8.00 for a pizza that can feed 2 always works.  Listen, your not going to be stuffed, but it is enough to feed 2 comfortably.\n\nYou start by selecting your sauce base, then move on to the toppings (which they have many to choose from).  Then, into the oven it goes.  The oven is so hot, your pizza is out in about 5 minutes with a nice crisp crust ready to enjoy!
