I'm a wildcat but I will say Wells Fargo Arena is a good place to watch a basketball game. Recently my niece was here as a trainer for a visiting team. We got our tickets way up high but I could easily see the entire court and didn't feel so far. It's also very bright. Probably because of the ugly yellow and maroon all over the place.lol. Had to throw that in!!!
