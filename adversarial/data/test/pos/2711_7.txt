I love this building, I am obsessed with this building, I want to live in this building.\n\nThis building houses large companies but it also has an amazing Downtown work space vibe.\n\nThey have community bikes, an amazing Sambalatte, a sando place, Mint lockers...it kinda reminds me of the Bridger Building that I used to park in and utilized a few months when I lived in the Private DTP 8th Street Apartments.\n\nWhy do I love this building soooo much? One word...LEED. I wish that these builders could build me a custom home.\n\nIt's a toss up between buildings like (the new) City Hall and this one that make me truly obsessed with eco buildings. \n\nThere are a couple of 15 minute parking spaces right past the gate if you need to stop into Mint locker like I do or want to get a Sambalatte like me.\n\nSambalatte validates the $3 parking fee just FYI. \n\nGo and relax check out the bathrooms and cafe...you will become obsessed like me...
