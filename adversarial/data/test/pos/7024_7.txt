Pass on the mani pedis.  The atmosphere is super relaxing and beautiful but the pedi mani was a big disappointment.  It started off really well, relaxing and then rush rush rush.  \n\n1. The girl cut deep into the left side of my thumb nail near the skin so now there is a big indent with an edge.  It's going to take months to grow that out. For the price I paid I'd was pretty ticked with this error...  Honestly, she should have admitted to it rather than trying to cover it up (which made the situation worse) and she should have given me a price reduction.\n\n2nd. The paint job itself was done with tons of layers too quickly so it was a bubble of paint that wasn't spread evenly across my nails.  (I think this had to do with her trying to cover up her mistake I mentioned above.)\n\n3rd. They didn't give me enough time to let things dry before asking me multiple times if I was ready to leave.. Needless to say my nails got are ruined.\n\nAlso, I didn't appreciate the lack of professionalism from the young women who seemed to be talking smack and giggling around the corner. I sat in the store area with the robes letting my nails dry a bit more and paying my bill and I felt really uncomfortable.\n\nI suggest they upgrade to more mature and experienced employees.
