This is the closest Noah's location for me. It doesn't have the biggest selection, but it still has a great hygiene, supplement, and food section as well as a few bulk item nuts and grains.\nI think it is great for convenience sake, but because there are many other more reasonably priced health food stores closer to home for me I rarely need to purchase anything here. \n\nThough I always find it worth while to stop in to check if you are looking for a specific item, or to price compare.
