I have high expectation since the chain is famous in Asia.\n\nYes, the property is very pretty same as the suite.  Yes no casino and night club make it very quiet and easy to walk around.  But this is all you can get from MO!\n\nService is the biggest disappointment there:\n\nReservation\n- I made the reservation online and from the suite description i was told Nespress machine will be in the room.  I was so excited for days cos this is very rare.   However i was told NO machine after i confirm with reservation via email. How can a hotel encourage customer to book online while offering inaccurate room & suite info??  After i talked to front desk, reservation and concierge,  front desk & concierge placed special request while reservation guaranteed me the coffee machine upon check in.  They kept passing me around to different department and seems no one can give me a firm answer for the issue originally caused by them!!  \n\n-FYI, the website isn't corrected yet for the Nespresso machine. It still shows all the suites will have the machine in room. I talked to them about this more than a month ago, how long does it take to take thing off from the website?\n\nFront desk\n-Check in was slow.  We understand early check in wasn't guaranteed.  However, i was told a category up suite was available NOW for $40 more per night.  I immediately agreed to it and hope we can get to our suit right away after a super long day.  Wrong!! Their `available now' means we had to wait full 3 hours cos it needed to be cleaned and checked by housekeeping manager.   I had no where to go to kill that 3 hours after breakfast in MO zen bistro.  Sitting by the pool wasn't an option cos i was so exhausted and all i needed was a bed.\n\n-Checkout was better but beware of billing error.  I was told the upgrade was $40 more per night and we signed up a buy 2 night got 3rd night free.  This  means we should pay nothing for the 3rd night except resort fees.  However, the hotel tried to charge me $40 + tax for 3rd night telling me this is upgrade not room rate blah blah.   Well $40 is ok but think about if `upgrade fee's is $150 from room to suite...I am glad they waive it finally but wonder why .\n\n-The hotel offers complimentary car service from the hotel to anywhere on the strip.  However, front desk didn't mention it and no one told us about their hours.  \n\nConcierge\n-They should be the easiest to talk to.  Wrong, they can't guarantee the coffee machines they inaccurately put on their website.  Half of the menu from their restaurants cannot be downloaded online and concierge forgot the attachments when i requested via emails.\n\n-my husband was interested in exotic car racing and called Concierge for preferred vendors and pricing if available.  It took them 2 hours to call us back saying NO for both.\n\nHousekeeping\/Luggage delivery\n-Guest what ? After my long fighting for the Nepresso machine, I still didn't see it when we got to our  suite.  The champagne we brought in from the limo went missing.  We had to call housekeeping a few times to hunt all these things down.  What a hassle after such a long wait for room?\n\n-Some of our toiletries\/ice bucket never got re-stocked or refilled during our stay.  We tried to push the valet button but no one bother to respond.  Seems we can only get service unless we call.  Then why bother to have valet button and closet ??\n\n-After 3 hours of waiting and being told the room was checked by manager, the curtain still didn't work.  They sent someone to fix it quick...but come on we were there for honeymoon, why did i get so busy to get them do things rather than enjoying ourselves?\n\n-During out check out, I told the front desk that a limo would pick us up at the hotel entrance by particular time.  However, they didn't bother to send our luggage down to bell desk to get it ready to upload when limo showed up...We ended up waiting for them in the car to let them  figure out where the heck our luggage were.  Thank god that we were not in time crunch to get to the airport..\n\n-Whenever i call from the room, i was seldom addressed by my name.  This is not something picky or demanding for a 5 stars hotel.\n\nSwimming Pool\/Fitness Center\n-Machines at the fitness center look nice only but very hard to use especially for interval training.  The touch screen is very annoying.\n\n-The pool is the smallest compared with same level hotels on the strip.  Good thing is almost kid-free and not packed at all\n\n-The service at Poolside cafe sucks, the attendants never offered me any menu or bother to follow up if i needed any beverages or food.    \n\nFor our entire 3 days stay, we were getting very tired to push the hotel staff to get things done. i can only recommend Spa, Tea Lounge and car service. there\n\nOverall,  if you just need a room in central location on the strip, go for it.  If you want some customer service or go for special occasion, stay with Wynn\/Encore,  otherwise all your energy will be sucked in to get things in a reasonable wa
