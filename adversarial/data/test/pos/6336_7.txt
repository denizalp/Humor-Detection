What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!! Not this time!!! I have got to share my epic experience at Mt Everest Indian restaurant with all of you who are going to be visiting Vegas in the future. Bookmark it, put it on your must do and have to visit list.\n\nMy Everest at 29,028 feet is the highest mountain on earth and one of the most beautiful sights and wonders of the world. Lucky to have flown over it in 1998 and taken some priceless videos and photos. \n\n Wednesday September 20, 2017 Las Vegas, Nevada got a similar rush and thrill as I had an amazing lunch at Mt Everest Indian restaurant on W Sahara Ave:\n\n1) Tasty, wholesome, lovely food prepared and served with a lot of love. The brown lentils and kidney beans were to die for. The potatoes and cauliflower dish was done just right and the flavors were so distinct and unique. The garlic naan bread was probably the best I have ever had. It was hot, fresh and had that lovely garlic that just stimulates your taste buds. Big smile!! The raita or yogurt with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and spices was the best I have ever had. It was cool and not creamy and lumpy. Bigger smile.\n\n2) Beautiful staff who were so caring, proactive and warm. Lunch hour was packed and they sure kept the flow going with grace and class. Loved meeting the very sweet Nepalese chef in his awesome Nepalese hat( or Bhadgaunle cap) who came out to check on the items and wished me with a great smile.\n\n3) $10.90 for an AYCE featuring 6 non vegetarian items, 5 excellent and ample vegetarian options, a great and fresh salad and pickle bar plus multiple v good desserts and fruit is beyond sweet.\n\n4) Perfect getaway from the strip. It is almost 2 miles west of the casinos and  I-15 on Sahara Ave and Valley View with no crazy traffic and loads of parking.\n\n5) Clean place! The staff is on top of the buffet. \n\n6) Clean, air conditioned and stocked rest room.\n\nThis was perfect. My review is the 1092nd review of this wonderful restaurant. I concur, I loved Mt Everest!!
