I'm from Texas.  I'm not Arizona's biggest fan and I hope not to remain here for the rest of my life.  Every time I think I'm getting out of here, something happens and I get stuck.  Eventually, I'll escape this hell and make it back home.  \nI miss everything about Texas.  The friendly people, the trees, grass in front yard, tubing on a river that actually moves, breakfast tacos, and barbeque.  Thank God, two of those things are here now!\nI had stumbled onto Texas BBQ House and I admit, I loved it, but it's in a sketchy part of town that I'd rather not go to.  (And there's something wrong about eating barbeque out of crates in Scottsdale.)  At one point, my boyfriend and I actually contemplated making the 6 hour drive to El Paso to get some Rudy's.  Luckily, the next weekend a friend told us they were building a Rudy's!  Close to our house!  Down the street from where I was currently working!  \nI think it was maybe 2 days after it opened before we finally made it down there and it was EXACTLY like walking into Rudy's that's 10 minutes away from my parent's house.  There's country music playing and Blue Bell ice cream and tubs full of every kind of Shiner you could ask for.  It felt like home.  Every time I go, I'm simultaneously elated to feel like I'm back in Texas and depressed to know I'm not.  \nEverything on the menu is amazing.  I'm a big fan of lean brisket and jalapeno sausage, but seriously, there's nothing on that menu I won't eat.  I always get one of the big tubs of potato salad and that chocolate pudding will change your life. \nAnd, if you go in the morning, there's breakfast tacos!  This is the only place in Arizona that seems to know what a breakfast taco is and serves them!  It's a travesty that we live in a state with flour tortillas, but they refuse to make breakfast tacos or even figure out what they are!  \nAs for the reviewer complaining about the crates and deli paper and *gasp* having to refill their own drink!  This is Rudy's Texas style barbeque.  We're friendly folk and we don't mind sharing a table with strangers.  Texans will just strike up a conversation with the people next to them, or in line with them, or hell, a phone call placed to the wrong number.  If you don't like it, go next door to the unlucky folk who happened to open a barbeque place next door to this gem.   And how can a place that's been open 24 years and opens a new location that looks exactly the same as all of their others be copying a place that opened maybe a year ago?  I do believe Texas BBQ House is copying Rudy's, not the other way around.  Get it right.  \nBottom line, if you haven't tried Texas style barbeque, you need to go here.  Forget all the lame reviews from people that don't know better.  Just come and have the best meat of your life.
