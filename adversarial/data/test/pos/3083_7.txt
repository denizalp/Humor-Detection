Dr. Phouschek is very personable, friendly, and makes you feel comfortable.  Unfortunately when you go there it feels like a patient factory, it is very busy, and the exam is rushed.  I had a punch biopsy done on my back, but not by the Dr., it was done by medical student he was overseeing.  The student did a very poor suture job on my back, the sutures failed. Now what should have been a small scar is now a crater in my back.\nOh, and be prepared to pay $$$$$$ for the service.
