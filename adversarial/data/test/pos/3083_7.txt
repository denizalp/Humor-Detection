Dr. Lisa Hoang is AWESOME!\n\nIt's been a few years since I've been to a dentist so I was so not looking forward to this visit but to my surprise, Dr. Hoang answered all my questions and totally made me feel at ease in understandable language.  \n\nThe hygienist did a great job with my cleaning-pain free and showed me how to brush and floss my teeth correctly.  I had no idea I have been brushing too hard and flossing the wrong way.  \n\nI was scared that I was going to need tons of work.  Luckily, I only needed a filling! Dr. Hoang explained everything to me before she even started. And as she did the filling, she constantly asked if I was okay.  Nothing hurt and I was completely relaxed.  \n\nDEFINITELY FOUND MY GO-TO DENTIST!  WOOHOO!
