Don't judge a book by it's cover. This place is a prime example. Sitting inside the Royal Resort on Convention Center Dr, is this hidden gem. \n\nWe were seated inside the dining room and I immediately loved the place. The Retro Old School Vegas vibe really intrigued me. Surrounded by mirrored walls and movie film reels on the ceiling, dark curtains and plush booths, we both really liked the vibe. \n\nOur server, Kendra, was eager to offer her suggestion on cocktails, after what we told her what we liked, she had suggested a jalepeno infused watermelon martini for myself and a sazerac for my friend. Both drinks were delicious.\n\nBread basket came out and I immediately spotted the pretzel roll. I love a good bread basket and this one did not disappoint. \n\nWe started out with 1\/2 dozen of Kumiai Oysters that were the special that day, I'm mad I've never had this oyster before! They were really good. \n\nSpecial of the day was John Dory fish, again I had never even of this fish, so I decided to try it. My friend ordered Bone In Ribeye. My fish was very mild, it was cooked perfectly. My friends Ribeye was the table favorite. We learned the grill master has been at it for 20 years, and it shows. Steak was tender and juicy. \n\nWe shared the famous Lobster Mac & Cheese, it's as good as it sounds. \n\nUnfortunately we were too full to try dessert. Next time.\n\nThey have a courtyard with a fire pit, it's the perfect time of year for outdoor dining. I really enjoyed this place, I can't say enough about the service as well, Kendra was great. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items.
