Ha... their $20 lap dance is an air dance. The dancer never touches you. \nThey take trickery to another level here. \nWatch your customer base disappear fast.\nThey should call it air dance and not lap dance.\nI totally felt stupid after 2 dances and 40 dollars later.\nNo. I'm good. It's the most stupid $40 I spent in my life.
