Can we all agree that the absolute most annoying thing is bad service?!? I had the strangest experience at Daily Dose. I read the review in the Arizona Republic about the amazing omelette's, pancakes, and overall atmosphere so I was dieing to try it! \n\nThe atmosphere is very lounge-like and completely different than most Breakfast hot spots. The owner was very friendly and sat us right away- the table happen to be next to her baby asleep on the booth bench next to me. You know when you are sitting so close to two other tables that it's hard to even hold conversation?? \n\nWe ordered- I asked for the Prime Rib Omelet and my boyfriend got the Caprese Omelet. Our server (there were only two for the entire restaurant) messed up the order but nonetheless, I felt the food was lacking overall flavor- basic things like Salt and Pepper! Don't be fooled- the food looks amazing! But back to the \"experience....\" \n\nAs the owner brings us our food, she was sure to point out \"tell all of your friends that this is a great place to drink!\" And brought us a drink menu filled with Happy Hour specials and things like \"Join us for NFL Sundays.\" So the loungy  atmosphere, with NFL Sundays and Drink Specials, leads me to ask... what exactly is this place?!? In Old Town Scottsdale, with so many Breakfast restaurants, or bars, or sports bars, you need to stand out- pick what type of place you're going to be, and go with it! \n\nThey most annoying part of our Breakfast was that good friends of the owner and server were seated at the table next to us- while the two payed more than enough attention to that tables needs for drinks\/paying the check, I sat there for a good 15 minutes with out Coffee or Water and a messed up order! It doesn't end there, another couple walks in the front door, and the owner is in the middle of bottle feeding her baby, so baby in tow, she seats the couple.... does anyone else think that's weird?!? \n\nIronically enough, as we're sitting there, empty cups, check ready to be paid, Channel 3 TV comes in to film the great place- I couldn't help but tell my boyfriend how unsatisfying the experience was as the camera man panned across our table.
