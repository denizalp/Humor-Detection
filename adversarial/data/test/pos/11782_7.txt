It has not started well. My booth back is broken so I have lean foreward. The wall along side us had large sections of paint pesled off, its dirty, and seems to be falling apart. To start of with My drink came out wrong and was sent back. My wife got a strawberry  margarita and it is watered down, low alcohol, no salt on glass. Basically the margaritas are trash. It is not happy hour so there is NO excuse for bad drinks. I ordered the Chimichanga my wife the shredded beef burrito. Hopefully the food is better than the impression so far of eating in a dump. Just realized we did not get silverware. I got it from another table seemed to piss off the server. \n\nGot food finally. My wifes burrito the tortilla was so old and stale it's cracked all over, the beef is dried out, and is extremely low quality. My chimichanga for a fried item is completely soft. Might be baked. Low quality food. Seems old pre made. Nothing has that fresh made taste. I have eaten food all over the USA, parts of Mexico, and overseas when I say this is just bad food. You get a decent amount of the bad food. But bad is bad.\n\nOne last thing I feel I must add on to this. If you are Hispanic you will get treated much better. Having watched the 3 white people  tables get there food, drinks, and everything else slammed down. We also all got mass attitudes from our waitresses when they bothered to come by. Speak a bit of Spanish and you get 2 or 3 waitresses helping your table. Suddenly  they are nice and helpful. Yes very different service. Also if you check out my pic I added if the waitresses have the time to play games on their phones and screw off they can defiantly provide better service or even clean this filthy place.
