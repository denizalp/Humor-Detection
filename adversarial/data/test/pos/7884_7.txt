This was terrible!\n\nWalking into the Excalibur late on Friday night the 19th of December. After a 5 1\/2 hour drive i was ready to just get in and situated. A gentleman who I assumed worked for the casino ask my husband and I if we would like hotel vouchers. Of course thinking \" stupid virgin newbies \" they were there to help us. They gave us the oh get free tickets and money and so forth. I made the mistake of using the restroom while they spoke to my husband. I come back and he is filling out a form and saying we need to pay them $50.00.\n\nThe girls who are selling us flat out said ..... just go listen to it, tell them no your not interested and you will be on your way. \n\nWe checked in at 9:45 the next morning thinking its Vegas there is nothing to do in the morning. We took a shuttle with 6 other people to the Grand View hotel which is about 15-20 minutes away. You are sardine d into a waiting area with 50 + other poor sucker souls. Greeted by your sales person and are shown to coffee\/juice and pastries. We spent about an hour or so watching a video and listening to their up-sale. After that they take you to another room and around the property. It was intriguing of course but at the same time I don't vacation every year. I am a working class gal who has to save a year or two for a long fun filled week of fun. \n\nSo we get back to the sales floor and I finally told them that I wanted the bottom line and what is the cost.... At first only $29,999 with $3400 down today... are you freaking kidding me! \n\nThen we came down to $27,000 with $1400.00 down today..... I told the guy flat out regardless of how much I find this interesting there will be no money coming out of my pocket today. Its the week of CHRISTmas and you want me to give you cash or credit card at this very moment. \n\nThen the manager \"closer\" came over. Very aggressive man. Spoke in slang and was not very professional. I couldn't even understand him except he was still continuing to ask for $1400.00. Today!\n\nSo he finally got the hint we weren't budging so he said they would go ahead and let us go.... Needless to say we had already been there for 3 1\/2 hours. \n\nOur salesman was actually so rude in the end and said that he gets so fu$%$ing annoyed by people like us..... I couldn't believe it. \n\nWe go downstairs to the power closers who work for corporate and have better deals of course. So then we got it down to $200 down and $103 per month for $5000 total..\n\nNope!!! Spoke with several people in the lobby waiting for our vouchers and everyone was given a different price. There was nothing across the board that was the same. \n\nWe did however get our vouchers. 2 tickets to Carrot Top ( which was almost sold out when we went to go turn our vouchers into tickets, they only had 4 seats left that night) They did give us $25 voucher for the Excalibur buffet and didn't tell us the buffet was being renovated and then $20.00 cash. \n\nAll in all this is very stressful and annoying to go through. If you can sit there and not allow high pressure sales people to get to you then by all means get some free shit. But because we were there for so long (5 hours in all) and all it did was raise by blood pressure. \n\nTIP: These guys bother you in the lobby all you have to do is give them \" thumbs up\" and they will leave you alone.
