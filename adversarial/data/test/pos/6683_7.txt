The saying goes, \"When pigs fly.\" When talking about the impossible. But obviously those ppl have never been to Cantine because they would know that in fact pigs MUST fly....I mean- where else would they find those delicious Pork Wings from???\n\nIf you get nothing else - you have to order those. They were crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, sweet, salty, and spicy all rolled into one. Impossibly good. \n\nMy second favorite dish was the ch√®vre stuffed peppadews. Creamy saltiness paired with sweet peppers, the arugula and balsamic reduction made me want to savor every bite. They should make it into a salad. Next time I'm not sharing it with anyone. Get your own!\n\nI love calamari but it's rarely very impressive from a uniqueness standpoint. Cantine definitely puts their own unique spin on things! The hot sauce and Gorgonzola cheese were tasty, but I missed the sweetness of a marinara sauce. Overall it was very good, but not something I would be compelled to order again (simply because there are SO many other things I want to try!)\n\nThe last dish we ate was the pomme frites with sriracha and truffles. This one would have been one of my favorites except I had some issue with the over starchiness of the fries. It didn't have that light and fluffy and crispy quality I would have liked to have seen. I bet they could hit this one out of the park if they made it with sweet potato frites instead. Sticking to that sweet savory mashup that they seem to do so well with. \n\nAnother thing that is cool about this joint is that you can buy a bottle of wine at regular store prices and drink it with you meal. It's like BYOB but better! They seem to have a huge selection.  \n\nYou would never expect to have such gourmet small plates at reasonable prices in a strip mall near a gas station. But then again- anything's possible when pigs fly!!\n\nI'll definitely make sure this quaint neighborhood joint is on my to do list whenever I visit CLE from DC!
