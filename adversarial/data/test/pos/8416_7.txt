I was hangry for chicken strips but hubby didn't want anything here so I decided it was just easier to go through the drive thru. They had forgitabotthat cole slaw & crinkle cut fries that needed ketchup badly. Regrettably I said no:(\n\nWhen I bit into that Texas toast it was gone in a few seconds! It was so yummylicious! I wished I had seconds on that toast! The chicken strips were actually very delicious. Not heavily battered or greasy. The flavors were yummy, juicy & tasty. Making me want more but my eyes are always bigger than my tummy. I could only eat 2 & saved the other 2 for the next day!\n\nTry it bc you will be pleasantly surprised! Normally I'm a true fan of CFA that I have to admit this Raising Cane's chicken strips were just as good if not better. Did I really say that? They gave us sauce that looked like thousand island but I'm guessing it was RC's signature sauce. I tried it & liked that too. I'm sure I'll be back one day as it's not a chain here in Northern California yet! Too many CFAs in town! LOL \n\nIt was so convenient right there by the Las Vegas South Premium outlets! Not far from our hotel! Hubby noticed that all they do are chicken strips. Very minimalistic menu. I faintly remembered hubby asking if they do soup but nope! I see they are located in Reno Nevada & Southern California. Either way that's a long drive! I'm patient in this case! Hehehehe!
