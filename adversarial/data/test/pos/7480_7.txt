An ok place to have a bite. Avoid at all cost during rush hour lunchtime on a weekday. \n\nThey have a nice section to charge your electronics if you're in a bit of a pickle. \n\nThe food choices are ok. My favourite is the Olly Fresco. \n\nThis place also links to simons, the movie theatre, and Montr√©al trust.
