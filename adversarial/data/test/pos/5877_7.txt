In my previous review, I mentioned experiencing rebate delays and a phone system glitch with Velocity Fulfillment. I'm happy to say that within a day (wow) of me posting my original review, Greg, a high-level investor in the company, personally contacted me through Yelp and offered his apologies.\n\nHe agreed that I should've received a check in the mail by now, and offered to have a check overnighted to me. He was sympathetic to my concerns and not pushy. He really did seem to care about righting a wrong.\n\nI'm always impressed when a business looks at (honest) negative feedback, takes that constructively and tries to make amends, and uses that experience to do better in the future. That does seem to be the case with Velocity, after all.\n\nFollowup: Looks like the check came as promised!
