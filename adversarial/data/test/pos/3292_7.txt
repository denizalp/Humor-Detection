I am definitely a fan of Jamba Juice -- but haven't had them in a while, they are unfortunately loaded with sugar. \n\nBut I never knew this location was here! I spotted it after a nearby reflexology appt the other day, and knew that I needed to treat myself. \n\nThe smoothie tasted as good as it always does.... it's just that the service at this location is a 180 from every other JJ I've been too. \n\nNo friendly \"Welcome to Jamba Juice\" greeting when I walked in the door. Instead it was 3 guys w\/ attitude.... and one which was super slow at making the smoothies (he's probably new I think). \n\nI will probably go back here, now that I know this location is here. But... hopefully the staff is friendlier next time.
