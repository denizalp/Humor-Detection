Came here for lunch out of the suggestion by a friend. Located on Russell and Rainbow, its in a complex you don't really expect there to be a restaurant. Though Russell is more busy nowadays but seems a little weird spot to put a restaurant. \n\nWhen I had visited the restaurant, apparently it didn't have a grand opening yet (LOL oops) \n\nWas a little skeptical when i first heard about this place. Bachi is associated with its popular two burger locations on the west and southeast side of town. When i heard Bachi and Healthy, i was like huhhhh? how is that gonna work out? \n\nService was good. Quickly brought to our table and given waters. (Granted they weren't busy and apparently they are open till only 3pm? and we were there at like 130pm) \n\nWas craving an eggs benedict since i havent had it in a few years so was going between HLK Surf n Turf Eggs Benedict and the Corned Beef Hash. As i said before, was craving for a eggs benedict and it was suggested by the waiter as well. \n\nHLK Surf n Turf Eggs Benedict (English Muffin with poached eggs, scottish smoked salmon, roast turkey, tomato, onion, capers & dill hollandaise, grilled asparagus) - Everything was stacked and presented perfectly. Eggs were perfect over easy with an ooooozy yolk that runs all over the stack when broken... Roast turkey was moist. Smoked salmon was not overpowering and a perfect saltiness. Tomato and onion gave it a nice crisp flavor with the creamy dill and caper hollandaise sauce. Capers weren't too overpowering as well. Worked well with the dill. The english muffin was a little soggy. Wish it was toasted a little more. \n\nBeignets (with housemade strawberry guava jelly) - only 3 pieces. All in the shape of triangles. Beignets were little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not really similar to the usual beignets ive had (in comparison to the ones at Downtown disney lol). The housemade strawberry guava jelly was delicious. Not too much guava flavor but pretty prominent in strawberry. Accompanied the beignets well. \n\nThe Lonely Bird  (ground chicken & turkey \"tsukune\" burger, herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, onion rings) - Friend ordered this. No side of fries or anything. just a burger. tho it has onion rings in it. Pretty big size. He liked it. May try this or the ostrich burger next time =X First place in the USA that ive seen ostrich on the menu. Almost thought eating ostrich was illegal here. Lol Ostrich is actually a red meat. Healthier and leaner than beef. \n\nOverall, interesting place. Iunoe how much healthy it was. They did have healthier options in comparison to their burger locations but to call the restaurant \"healthy life\" was a little out of the park. I guess it was kind of like SkinnyFats. At least they have healthier options on the menu?
