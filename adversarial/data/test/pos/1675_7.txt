The Pamela Anderson of hotels. Looks really hot from a distance but, up close, shows her age, cracks, cheapness and is overshadowed by those half her age. \n\nThis place screams \"only relevant because of our location next to the Convention Center!!!\". Take your money elsewhere. You need a cab to get to a decent restaraunt. You might as well stay and eat  at a nice place and take a cab to the convention. My room was so tired and dirty with stains in the faded carpet including DNA from several generations. My sink would not drain and my toilet was difficult to flush. The grout in the shower was no longer white. The tv was a flatscreen but not HD. No iPod hookup, $14 per day for Internet, no minibar, cracked furniture, plastic wallpaper........crappy, overpriced restaurants through and through.......\n\nUGH!   I'm done here.........
