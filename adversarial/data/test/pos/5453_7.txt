Mandalay Bay\n\nMandalay Bay's got it all!!  All in one!!  It's Awesome!!\n\nAt the right time....quick \"Check In's\" and \"Check Outs\"\nAt the wrong time....long line to \"Check In\"and \"Check Outs\"\n\nRooms are nice and clean.  Separate shower stall, separate bath, separate toilet.\nMy view from the 19th floor after midnight:\n \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eAc9Vd6loOgRQolMXQt6FA?select=3bTDjCebxrwMa_9_N2gZXQ\n\nThe Lobby:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eAc9Vd6loOgRQolMXQt6FA?select=g57fZpfL-B1Q_vkQlmw6Ng\n\nOne of the Pools.....after Mid-Night:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/eAc9Vd6loOgRQolMXQt6FA?select=m1l8euoY8V6v5TnI5jvw_g\n\nNot sure where to begin?\n\nThe Casino\nThe Restaurants\nThe Bar\nThe Shops\nThe Sports Center (Place your bets here)\n\nThe Casino is open 24 hours a day.  Black Jack, Poker are available at certain times only.\nThe various restaurants are open for Breakfast, Lunch \/ Brunch and or Dinner and some open Late Night.\nThe convenient necessity shop should you need a razor, nail clipper, snacks or something along those lines.\nThe clothes shops....There are a few specialty shops to get some clothes....These shops will dress you up nice and totally pimp you out!!\nThe Sports Center.....Got a favorite sports team....want to place a bet....do it here.\nThe Restaurant.....take a stroll around and see what you like...sorry food on this trip for me was just a convenience....not my focus of attention.\nThe Bars and Lounge area......at night they have live band singing with light dancing.\nThe Movies......Feel free to catch a movie or a show.\n\nSo basically this hotels got it all.  There are more to do outside of the Mandalay Bay.  There is a Tram that takes you to the Luxor and to Excalibur.\n\nThere is a Car Rental company (Avis) on site should you need a car.  If your staying on the strip it might be better to cab it.  Limo's are reasonable for large groups.\n\nWhat else can I say?\n\nThe best part of my room was the showers.\nThey have the \"High Presure Shower Heads\" which are fantastic.  It will knock your socks off and make you feel so refresh in minutes.  If only Jerry and Kramer had this:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dlrtQb24Qxw\n\nA good solid hotel all around....love the powerful shower head.
