If I could give them zero stars I would. I called at 5pm on Sunday for an emergency iPhone 6 screen replacement. I called and it went to a voicemail system that hadn't been setup. I called a couple other places that also close at 6 and no one answered the phone there either. A few minutes later I got a call back from Desert Wireless (assuming missed call-caller ID). I explained the situation and they told me to come down by 5:30, it takes 1\/2 hour to fix. I got a call back from another company but My boyfriend has used Desert Wireless several times in the past so we decided to stay loyal. They are a little more expensive than other places and far from where we live but no issues in the past (and awesome, they told us to come down 'it would be no problem'). \nWe were there at 5:30 like they suggested. My boyfriend walked in the door, wasn't greeted for about 7 minutes (despite the door alarm alerting them someone had walked in). He then hit the bell. The guy said \"be right out\". He came out 10 min later and he asked if he was picking up. My boyfriend said \"no, we called about the iPhone 6, you told us to come down\". He said \"oh, well what time was that?\" My boyfriend said \"5:30, I've been waiting here\". The guy said \"okay, let me go check\". Two more customers walk in then another guy walks in the door and asks if he's been helped. The other walks out and says it's too late now and he can't fix his phone tonight.  My boy friend was pissed, gave them a piece of his mind, and left at 6pm. Now he is going on his trip in the morning to the middle of nowhere for a week with a broken phone. \n Worst part, I had a call back from another company who also closed at 6pm but I told them we decided to go with Desert Wireless. Now EVERY other place is closed and now we have ZERO options before he leaves on his business trip. \n\nWORST.SERVICE.EVER. \n\n\nGreat way to treat loyal customers who have referred family and friends to your business. Good thing for us there are A LOT more businesses out there who will take care of iPhone fixes and I'm sure they'll appreciate the thousand dollars in repairs we have spent with this ungrateful company. With 6 people in our house and 9 repairs in the last year alone at $140 inclusive each time. Yeah.... People beware. There are too many options to be wasting your time with them.
