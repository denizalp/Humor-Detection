What a great Yelp Elite Event! Platform's Sour Brew Bash was a blast! \n\nIt was great to get to see the beginnings of what I'm sure will be a new Cleveland hot spot. Being new to sour beer myself, I was happy to learn from some of the most passionate brew masters I've ever met. Ben and Paul made the entire night enjoyable and informative and I can't wait to visit this location when they open next year.\n\nAs a scientist, I really appreciated Ben's scientific descriptions of the beer making processes. When someone describes flavors as \"phenolic\" or that you can really taste the \"esters\" in the beer, I know I'm talking to a fellow science nerd. \n\nThe beer tasting (what we all really came for!) was a treat. The two Platform sours were amazing and it was really fun to see where they're trying to take their beers in the future. Keep up the great work Platform, we'll be back!
