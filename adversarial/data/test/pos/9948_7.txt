What drew me here was the rest velvet crepe cake. I had always seen them but never got a chance to try one. I felt like crepes one night turned to my trusted yelp for suggestions and viola found this spot.\n\nIts a cute trendy place for coffee and dessert. Quiet and private for a gathering with friends or family. Only con I can see is the place is in the back of a small, not well lite plaza so it is a bit hard to find. \n\nI definitely want to try the match crepe cake so I'll be back. The red velvet one was delicious! Not too creamy so the layers of crepes didn't fall apart which is what I was expecting. We also had the honey toast with strawberries and almond slices. Honey toast was sweet but not overpowering.
