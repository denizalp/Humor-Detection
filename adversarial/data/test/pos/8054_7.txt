Yuck! My FIRST 1 Star review, (I think)\n\nThis show is just plain SAD.  If you think you will see a country superstar, think again.  OK, so a fake Reba is a country legend and so is a fake Willie, but a fake Big & Rich and and a real Cody Collins??? How the heck does anyone in their redneck loving mind consider this cast of characters to be \"superstars\"???\n\nThe Reba chick has had this same shtick going all the way back to the \"Honky Tonk Angels\" impersonator show and I saw that and she ain't gotten any better, in fact I think she's gotten worse.\n\nThe Willie guy doesn't look like Willie and sure don't sound like Willie.\n\nNow, I will admit, I am a country traditionalist and look at a Johnny Cash, a George Jones and a Randy Travis or Patsy Cline to be a superstar, but NOT Big & Rich (especially FAKE ones) or Cody Collins to be superstars.  These are flash in the pan \"stars\" without staying power.\n\nIt's a good thing we got the tickets free with our room stay a month or so ago at the Golden Nugget.  I would have hated to have to had paid for this moronic show.\n\nI wish we had gone to see Gordie Brown again, he does a great show and far more enjoyable than this piece of junk.\n\nYuck!  Yuck!  Yuck!
