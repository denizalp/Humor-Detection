I believe that Cream Stereo Lounge claims to have the loudest sound system in the Valley. That might be the only credit I give them because after living outside of this bar for a year, I can attest that their stereo system is loud...and when I say loud, I mean it in a delirious-I-didn't-sleep-night-after-night-because-of-their-sound-system sort of way. But this review will not be solely based on my sleep deprived nights. \n\nI swore I would never enter Cream Stereo Lounge mostly because I knew it wouldn't be my scene and mostly because of my lack of sleep thanks to this Old Town spot. However, after years of avoiding Cream, I've been dragged their now twice and can say that it was everything I expected. \n\nI did the clubs. I can still do the clubs if the night calls for it. However, Cream Stereo Lounge is not quite the club for me. It's tiny, it's loud, it's normally not very crowded and the crowd that frequents this bar isn't for me. The drinks are pricey, the music is mixed and there isn't a ton going on there. They charge a cover which is rarely the case for a bar in Scottsdale and I don't think it would be worth it for a guy or girl to pay a cover to go to this bar.
