Welcome to a fairytale in the desert. From the minute I enter until the minute I leave, I feel like I'm in pleasantville. Everything about DC Ranch is clean, cute and comfortable. From the houses to the market street, everything is top notch. \n\nOver the years, DC Ranch has taken a little turn. What started as the all-in-one community equipped with nightlife, day-life and living essentials, has transformed into more of a community without so much of the nightlife -- and I think that's a good thing. \n\nI will begin with Market Street. This is the area that has transformed over the years and with it, the nightlife style bars have vanished. I think this has allowed DC Ranch to turn into more of a homey community rather than the next Old Town. Several restaurants still line the streets, and very popular ones at that. On of my favorite wine bars is still there and there are several boutique retail stores. It's a nice shopping area to walk around on a weekend. \n\nNow moving on to DC ranch, the community. The houses in DC Ranch are like little castles. The architecture is pretty and the houses are private and in a community at the same time. Within the community, residents have a \"club\" equipped with a pool, playground, tennis courts and community area. This is perfect for families and makes it a community with real neighbors. Each section is behind gates as well. \n\nI think that DC Ranch is a great option for a family with small children who want to live in a safe and enclosed area.
