Found this shop thru Yelp a few years ago. They not only do fantastic work but don't try to sell you on anything you don't want or need.\n\nI got visor tint installed literally within a day of learning there is such a thing a few months ago. How can I not have known about it for the last 21 years in Arizona?!? Well, can't unring that bell but if you haven't tried visor tint it is LIFE CHANGING! (Visor tint is tinting the top several inches of the windshield) \n\nThey'll have you sit in the car and make sure the visor tint height is right. The level I got was slightly different than what I thought I wanted. Once behind the wheel it felt like it disappeared and I got used to it almost immediately! \n.\nAfter driving the same car for 14 years I finally am breaking down and getting my front windows tinted too. Just can't bear another summer with no protection! \n\nLook at all these 5 star reviews. They work on all vehicles and even exotics.
