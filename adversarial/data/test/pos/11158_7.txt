Vegas...a place where a lot of people get addicted to certain vices. Sure we've all heard of folks addicted to gambling but how about being addicted to crack pie?!? \n\nCrack pie is the famed pie of Milk Bar and it's so good, that folks get addicted. Awhile back crack pie was only available in NYC but Milk Bar started slowly opening up in various cities and the latest spot is in Sin City! \n\nLocated at the Cosmopolitan is the home of the addicting pie. It's also the place to get compost cookies, cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookies, corn cookies, blueberry and cream cookies and chocolate cookies. Ooh how can I forget, that this place also offers soft serve, truffles and shakes (oh hey this is Vegas so they do have fancy shakes with alcohol in it)! \n\nWho cares about gambling, when you can be addicted to something that will please your tastebuds! Your tastebuds are sure to be pleased with the sweet treats of Milk Bar.\n\nI got a nice selection of treats here; cookies, truffles, soft serve and of course their crack pie. Each of the cookie I tried was delicious. Their cookies are so soft! Equal in softness and goodness is their truffles. From the soft serve, my favorite is their crack pie soft serve....hmm back to that crack pie again (maybe I'm addicted ;). Last but not least is their crack pie. I've had it before in DC and it still remains to be one of my favorite pies ever. It really is just that good and a bit addicting. \n\nIt's nice to see Milk Bar finally in Vegas. It gives a little more sweetness to Sin City and alright maybe another vice fir folks...a sweet one ;).
