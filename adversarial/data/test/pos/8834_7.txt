This is the absolute worst shoe repair EVER! I took a pair of leather heels to be polished and to have a sole put on the bottom. When I picked them up there were holes in the insole of my shoe!!! Took them back. They tried to fill the hole and replaced with a horrible white insole! When I tried them on, I could not even get my foot in the shoe. He then told me he would stretch them. Lets just say that did not work! I feel I should have been reimbursed the total of my shoe not just the cost if the services I asked for. The customer service is horrible and I was blamed for the extra work that the man ha to do when clearly it was his fault there were holes in the insole of my shoe! I WILL NEVER RETURN AND I SUGGEST NO ONE EVER GO HERE!!!!
