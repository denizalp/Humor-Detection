We came here to ice skate and check out the Christmas lights. \n\nSelf Parking: 30 dollars\nValet: 40 dollars\n\nSay what? That is more than Rockefeller Center in Manhattan!\n \nWe waited behind three busses of Ohio State fans who were blocking the entire entrance of the hotel. Pulling up to the valet, only one valet opened up the drivers door while the three other valets were standing around chatting.  \n\nThe ice-skating rink was very beautiful, as usual. The ice itself was very well-maintained, with the Zamboni machine at the ready. Renting ice skates was a breeze, Although the quality of the rentals was quite poor. The staff was very friendly at the rental kiosk as well as on the ice. The surroundings were very beautiful. The holiday music was not too loud. They have bleachers for the family members who only want to observe and not skate. It would be nice if they have some type of lockers or storage area for the people who do you want to skate who have items such as purses, bags,  or purchases from the gift store.\n\nThe seasonal holiday train which takes you around the expensive resort grounds was very pleasant and fun, lasting about 10 to 15 minutes round-trip. The Fairmont Hotel does a fantastic job's with all their holiday lighting. The line however can become very long. We waited about 25 minutes but the line can easily be over an hour and longer prior to Christmas.  \n\nIf it were not for the exorbitant parking fee I would easily rate this at five.  However, $30 for self parking and $40 for valet is plain ridiculous.
