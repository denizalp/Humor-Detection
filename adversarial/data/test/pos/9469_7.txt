\"My friends and I were at the club with a double table, there were about 15 of us. Everything was fine, we were just drinking and having fun like Vegas supposed to be. A few girls (out of our group) were dancing for HOURS standing at the couch area, and none of the bouncers said anything, until one of my guy friends decided to hop there and dance as well. He was drunk but he was not disrespecting nobody and not acting like an idiot - he was just dancing. That was when this bouncer named bob approached him with a flash light and asked him to step down, he did but questioned why. They kinda of started an argument but my friend came Back to our table. That's when this bouncer Bob just RUN inside of our table area, stepping on my foot and LITERALLY and spitting all my drink on my dress, without an apology  or anything he grabbed my friend by the arms and decide to kick him out of the table he payed for. This is not the attitude you expect from an employee of a nightclub when you are paying very good money to have your own space. I really hope to hear back from you.\"\n\n\nI sent this to Intrigue management 3 weeks ago and never got a response. Awesome costumer service, huh?
