Disappointing. I'd describe it as a bare bones, no frills place to just lift and go. \n\nI'm not a big fan of how its laid out. Kind of an odd set up. The equipment seems old and quite worn, but its still functional. Only 2 water fountains in the place and only one has cold water. \n\nThe locker room was kind of nasty and the scale was all screwed up and I could not get it to calibrate to get an accurate weight, so I had to go to the one on the gym floor by the offices.\n\nI guess the worst thing about this place is the employees. Customer service is non existant in this place. They chit chat with each other and ignore you when you come in. Some will look right at you and not even acknowledge you. Just completely indifferent to most people around them. Its not like this is the only 24 where Ive come across this. Its getting to the point where I am really starting to consider going back to LVAC, and I never thought Id see THAT day!\n\nwhat a let down...\n\n\n\nget in.lift.get out.\n\n\ndon't expect much more from this place..
