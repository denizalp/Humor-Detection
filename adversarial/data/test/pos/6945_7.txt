This review is more for the stylist Vera Chamberlin then the salon, although the salon was a fine place, it was Vera that gave me the drop dead radest hairdo ever to grace my skull. \nFirst I should say, when I called to make the very last minute appt, one hour before I wanted it, they were totally accommodating. \nArriving at the salon, it's off the strip in a plaza, the place is very casual and comfortable. Had a 6pm appt, only waited a few minutes, enough time to find a photo of what I wanted in their picture books of cuts. \nWhen Vera was ready for me, she took me back to wash my hair, but noticing it was clean opted to just rinse with conditioner instead. Before cutting anything she talked and looked at photos with me, to make sure she had a clear vision of what I wanted. \nShe started in on the cut, very close attention was paid to detail, she took her time, not too long, but worked patiently and all I can say is WOW! Turns out she knows a thing or two about cutting hair. Honestly the best hair cut I have ever had!\nAside from the amazingly awesome hair cut, she's super sweet, and a great convo, but not to much chatting, the whole experience with her set the stage for the greatest night out at The Beauty Bar on Freemont for the Meat Puppets show. She turned me into the diva I wanted to be to see my favorite band ever, thank u Vera! Hope you read this, lots of love for my amazing cut lady.
