Ok...so we all know (or at least I do...) that the Floridino's on Alma School is really really good. Not only is it good, but it's cheap! \n\n\nThe BF and I decided to try the new location and to our surprise it is not really the same restaurant. I think it has different owners (?), the menu is different, the prices are higher, the food is not as good, and the service is lacking to say the least. I was SO disappointed. The restaurant itself is a lot colder feeling than the original, with weird lighting and is strangely quiet (the place wasn't empty, but it didn't have that bustling with business feel or sounds like the original has). Our waitress did not smile and seemed genuinely angry when we needed a minute to decide on food and when we told her we were sharing. Not real cool. We shared a salad, breadsticks, and a calzone. The salad was fine (but the dressing tasted slightly off from the other restaurant), the breadsticks are totally different....like thicker and hard.... the calzone was bigger, but the dough used was not as tasty as the dough at the original location. I still gave the place 3 stars because the food was decent, but, needless to say, I would never choose this location over the original. \n\n\nPS: The BF asked me if it was fair to compare this location to the original (because, honestly, if there was not an original and better version I probably would have given this place a 4) BUT I do think it's fair because even if it is different owners, they are using the same name and so, in my opinion, they should have consistency in their menu, prices, and service..... Just sayin.....
