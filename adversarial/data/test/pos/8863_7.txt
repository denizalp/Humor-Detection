Your average every-day 7-Eleven convenience store with gas pumps.. and super friendly staff!\nCame by on my way to a World Cup party to snag some beer, and found a 12 pack of Newcastle with a great price: $12.49, barely over a buck a bottle. Damn good!\nPlunked it down at the register.\n\nWas helped by a friendly guy who chatted with me about this great beer. When I mentioned the great price, he said, \"Oh, no, that's not a great price.\" I was stunned for a second, where has he seen it better? Is he referring to wholesale?\n\nAnd then, he did something miraculous.\nHe took out a coupon from behind the register, swiped it, and showed me: $4 off my precious Newcastle! Making my beverage of choice for the Argentina game an absolute steal at just under $10 with tax. \n\nAnd yes, we won the game, too.
