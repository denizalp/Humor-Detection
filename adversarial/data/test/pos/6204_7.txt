Stay away from this place. It is not a safe place to receive piercings. I should've known better when I realized she wasn't wearing any gloves. Afterwards, she told me to use alcohol to clean my piercing and never gave me aftercare instructions. The women was very rude when I told her she misquoted the price she originally gave me. I went to two other tattoo\/piercing places around the area afterward and they were frightened for me.
