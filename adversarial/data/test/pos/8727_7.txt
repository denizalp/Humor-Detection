Update #2: I've now no longer a client. After going for a few follow-up color\/cut appointments, post our initial lightening, I've went back to my original stylist. He immediately saw the issue with my color (the \"band\" of hair color lighter than the rest) & that was fixed pretty fast. I've realized the issue at this place is completely inadequate light which made it hard for the stylist to see exactly what the problem with my color was.\n\nUpdate: I just wanted to add that after seeing Sabrina today (April 11th) for the correction, I'm left with a much better impression overall. Thank you for making me happy! Both the color and the cut were fixed to my liking!\n\nContrary to all the previous amazing reviews, my experience was not up to par to my (high) expectations. I have purchased a Buytopia deal for 39 for \"cut, color or highlights, deep conditioning treatment, neck and shoulder massage, champagne and chocolates\". I also intended to do a color correction at this salon. I have booked a consultation session with Sabrina regarding the process, which went extremely well - we discussed and agreed on the color I wanted to achieve & Sabrina even snipped a lock of my hair to experiment the color correction treatment on. Needless to say, I was going into my appointment with extremely high hopes - sort of really excited to change up my color & having faith in stylists' work.\nWe have started off with the color \"stripping\" process so we could lighten up my very dark brown shade. The treatment didn't feel uncomfortable but at one point I could hear the girls chatting about the steps of this procedure and one of them told my stylist that she can Google it for her. That was a bit worrying. After the treatment was done, my hair was washed out a few times, and next the new color was applied. By the way, at no point during my 3 hour appoint was I offered water or the massage that my purchase was including. When I asked about the massage at the receptionist desk, she suggested that that it was done while I was getting my hair washed - how can a shoulder and a neck massage be given during the wash beats me. \nThe coloring part of the appointment seemed to go well - my hair was washed off once again, Sabrina has assured me that it looks nice - from what I could see in the mirrors in the salon light it did look good. Next was my cut appointment with Melanie, who immediately assured me that she loves bobs & loves cutting them as well. I was under full impression that I will leave the salon with a fantastic cut. Well it wasn't - one side was left longer than the other which I noticed in the washroom mirror and went back to ask for a fix. For some reason Melanie insisted on layering the opposite side of my cut more..? After the first fix, I decided to fix my parting and noticed that one side is still longer than the other. My cut was basically done around my side parting - which would mean every time I change the spot where my hair parted, it would make one side longer. By this time Melanie's next client was waiting and she was seemingly in a rush to finish up with me. From what I could see the cut was fixed. Both girls have told me repeatedly that the color looks great. I've looked at my color at both the washroom mirror and the salon mirrors and everything looked good.\nLike I mentioned, the massage wasn't done and neither was the champagne offered. The trouble started when I got home and looked in my mirror - the color was NOT what we agreed on. The roots are now darker and a big section of my hair looks brassy, and it goes back to brown on the ends. It seems that the new color was not able to set in properly to cover all the \"stripped\" sections. My cut is still not symmetrical, with one side being longer. I have called the salon immediately and we have made an appointment for Thursday to have the color fixed, somehow. To top it all, I think I'm having an allergy reaction to the treatment that I had done to strip the hair of color - the left side of my scalp is numb for 2 days now \nAll in all I feel very let down - I have forgone the trip to my usual salon because I felt that their charge for color correction was very high, and decided to try out a \"deal\" place instead. I've had much better cuts in the past & my color, well I feel it would look much better if I just asked for a root touch-up instead.
