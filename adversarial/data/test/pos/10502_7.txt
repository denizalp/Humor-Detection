I loooooove this place!\n\nHusband and I have driven across town on several occasions just to get this coffee.\n\nWhen we go to Tempe we go to that location also.\n\nWhy do we love it? Customer service! \n\nWe get a large double torture something with soy milk. I can never remember the order but my husband does.\n\nI usually just get black iced coffee because that's my fav!!!!!\n\nThe employees that work here are the nicest people in town, go there, you will see!!!
