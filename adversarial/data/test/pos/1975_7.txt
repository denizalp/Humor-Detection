You know what cooks my gullet? chafes my chain-mail ?wets my dragon? splints my broadsword? curbs my arrow? smudges my scroll?\n\nI hate it when I walk into a liquor merchant- be it the local neighbourhood  store or the evil superstore depot- and in my search for a refreshing bottle of mead I'm met with dumbfounded queries as to what mead is. Why it is the sweet nectar of the gods! The tears of a million flower maidens! The golden droplets of Valhalla!\nWorse yet, I am met with sarcastic responses like \"nooo, we don't carry THAT here..\" in which I am forced to respond with malicious medieval justice, (or at the very least, cast hexes and spells behind their backs)\n\nWell imagine my surprise when I walk into the wine mecca of Willow Park  Wines and Spirits and have my quest fulfilled as I am met with a gleeful \"MMEEEAD!? We have a humble but pleasing selection, right this way my lord..\". Soon enough I was directed to a respectable shelf  of mead selections. Although they did not carry mead from all six corners of the flat world, they did carry a variety in which I was happy to barter for including the spiced mead I happened to enjoy after a cumbersome day of warlock slaying. Unfortunately they would only accept money in all its forms of wizardry, meaning cash, debit, or credit card. They seem to lack understanding of how priceless of a dragon's gullet is.\n\nIn all seriousness, this place is great. A little pricey on some of the liquor sold but I've visited numerous times and never left empty handed. The customer service is impressive in that they always have a recommendation for whatever your needs are and are very compromising to your price range. I am not much of a wine drinker but I was really impressed with their wine section and I would be interested in trying out their wine tasting events.\n\nYah I go nuts over mead, you should see me when I go on a sake hunt :D
