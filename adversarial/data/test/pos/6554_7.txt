Coincidentally, as I type this update to my original review, I'm once again eating Stroopwafel at my laptop!!\n\nAfter the 100th dropped call on my iPhone, plus a grab bag of other niggling idiosyncrasies (battery going from 100% to 0% in two hours since the latest software update), I decided to show up at Apple Store and see what their diagnosis was. After all, I did have precisely five days left on my one year warranty. I showed up at 11:30am and got an appointment for 15 minutes later.\n\n(And I swear I don't only award these guys top marks just because they keep giving me free stuff.)\n\nDylan, another California-esque cutie with a sharp haircut and killer tats, had a gander at my phone and after sharing a laugh over the general incompetence and blamegaming of Rogers tech support, he suggested replacing the phone. For free. Why not? Still under warranty, right? He wiped the phone in front of me, juiced up the new 3GS with the latest OS and handed me my phone about 15 minutes later. \n\nToo easy.
