They have been open just about a month and I finally got a chance to check it....hair had to grow!  When u go in u sign in on the computer and choose your stylist or first available if you don't care.  Decorated like a man cave, tv's everywhere and sports memorabilia adorning the walls.  The withing chairs were very comfortable for the short time I waited...there were 4 stylists working and I was lucky enough to fall into Liz's open chair.  She greeted me with a fabulous teethy radiant smile and escorted me to her chair.  We went thru the usual cut style and I went with their full package which was supposed alpassage, wash and cut...26$  if you just want a cut..12$!!!!!  WHAT??!!!  Yes 12$!!!  I recommend the massage, I was putty in Liz's hands...it was amazing! I fell just shy of letting go a few snores..the cut was just what I wanted! To coin a phrase from the Governator... \"I'll be back!\"
