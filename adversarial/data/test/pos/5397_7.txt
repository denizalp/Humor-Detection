I just had to be an Indian foodie today.  Lunch buffet at India Palace, now dinner at Jai Ho.\n\n-Chicken corn soup:  Was very creamy and flavorful.  The sweetness of the corn paired with chunks of chicken made this bowl of soup so good.  Because we like it a  bit hot, we asked for some soy sauce and hot sauce.  This took the soup to a whole different level. \n\n-Goat Karahi:  yep yep, love my goat.  The first bite I had, it was a bit tough.  I was a  bit disappointed.  But nope, I didn't stop there, I can't give up on it yet.  I took another bite, it was more tender.  So what did I do...I was on a hunt for the more tender pieces in the pot.  I wish they were ALL tender.  It's ok.  I might not order this again though.\n\n-Chicken Tikka:  I am used to more flavorful chicken tikka (I am from Houston where there are many indo-pak restaurants...)\n\n-Keema Naan:  It was decent\n\n-Garlic Naan:  lots of garlic on this naan.  Very good.\n\n-Kulfi Faluda:  I have been on a hunt for a Faluda ever since I came to Las Vegas.  This has been the only place that have something similar.  The icecream that was given to me was the pistachio icecream (hence the kulfi in the name).  I am used to the vanilla icecream.  It changes the flavor by alot.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but just not as good as I remembered it.\n\nThe server actually gave us a free order of chicken boti because he did not mention to us that the chicken tikka may take 25 mins since they made to order.  This free order was actually my favorite.  The chicken was nice and tender.  I place this on a garlic naan, some onion, a squeeze of lime, then dunk this bad boy in the tamarind chutney sauce and WALLA!  Made my night!\n\nService: 5 stars!\nFood: super close to 4 stars!\n\nResults:  Definitely recommend and I will come back Fo SHo!
