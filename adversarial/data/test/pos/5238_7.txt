This is a very modern and quirky building. It features dozens of colorful windows that makes it pop among all the gray.\nInside, it is really big. Its a mall of sorts. Lots of shops and some restaurants. There also was a car show going on while we were there. I didn't get to see it because the line was long and car shows aren't really my thing. We didn't explore as much, bit it is worth mention and commenting on what I saw. Bathrooms are very cleaned and well stocked. We enjoyed a hot coffee and walked around a bit while we waited for the snow to stop. Great place!
