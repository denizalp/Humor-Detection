One of the ol' school sushi joints in Vegas, these guys are doing an OK job. I was told by one of the owners that they were the originators of what is known as \"Las Vegas sushi\" I can neither confirm nor deny this claim.\n\nCame here with a bunch of peoples who were on the lookout for some AYCE sushi. After we came in, we were shown to our seats in which they used banquet chairs. The tables are a little smallish for 4 peoples but we were able to squeeze in. I had to hold my breath.\n\nNow off to the AYCE. Everything was good, some standouts include the tuna karai, the coconut shrimp which tasted like TGIFridays version, and salmon kama.\n\nOne thing though the service was inconsistent. Sometimes they were thoughtful, other times, I had to flag down a server several times to refill our water.\n\nAnother note, the portion size was a little bit too big for AYCE. Normally, I complain when a business is too stingy. But for AYCE, I wish they were smaller so that I could of had a chance to try the nigiri, and other rolls. \n\nI would come back here as a fallback in case bluefin was too packed. But it is what it is, so next time take care of yourself.. And each other.
