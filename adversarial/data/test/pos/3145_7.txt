One star for location and store\n\nThe manager of hair salon.  Did my hair once\nMy Lord. \nHe talked himself up like I was getting my hair done by the greatest professional since Paul Mitchell \n\nHorrible job\nJamie was his name \nOk colorist awful stylist\n\nI never went back not only to him\nBut not back to the store that's near my home \nI chose to drive the extra 6 miles to the one on Stephanie street
