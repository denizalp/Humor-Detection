I like off broadway shoes, I think they have the best rewards and sales program. I got a pair of $90 for $20! They also give you $10 off for your birthday. Their boots sale right now is that the beginning of boots season whereas most places will offer sales at the end of a clothing season. The store layout is nice, spacious, and organized. I like the sales associates, they are all great except for Raven, 1 of the store managers, I found her to be condescending and rude. Luckily 1 aloof monkey doesn't stop the show, so just find someone else to ask about sales and merchandise. Otherwise, love the store.
