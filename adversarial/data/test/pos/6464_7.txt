My first impression of the place was \"this is nicely decorated\".  Classic and modern blended in a very nice way. I must say... I thought it is a retail store from outside. Thank goodness my friend insisted that he thinks it is a restaurant. \n\nEnvironment - 5\nIt is beautiful. I love the giant yellow front door especially. \nService - 5\nAustin is the man.  He is so cool and friendly.  He provided just the right amount of service. \nFood - 5\nSo good.  My friend got the rib dip sandwich and I got the chicken sandwich. Plus I got a dessert.  Yum yum in my tum tum.  \nOverall experience - 5\nLove it.  It was a nice afternoon meal with a relaxing environment. \n\nI would highly recommend this place.  And please haters out there... Don't complaint about every little thing.  My first job was at a restaurant. People complaint about the most ridiculous and stupidest things on earth.  Get a life or cook your meal at home.  Or just go to McD.  \n\nGood job.  Keep it up. \nThanks Austin for being awesome.
