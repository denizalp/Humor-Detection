What the heck is going on with Burger King. Double whooper w\/cheese combo meal....$940.are the f'n crazy. There are places here in town I can get a steak dinner for that much. Plus the service is lowsy. Been there twiice in  1 week, no napkins either time. GO TO HELL BURGER KING. YOU HAVE LOST ME.
