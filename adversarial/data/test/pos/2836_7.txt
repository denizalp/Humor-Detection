The wife and I continued to \"unlock our Monday\" at Beauty & Essex for dinner.  We had reservations for 9PM.  The place was jammed, literally and figuratively, when we got there.  Although I haven't been to the NYC original, Beauty & Essex's dining room, unsurprisingly, reminded me of a lot of some NYC restaurants where space is at a premium and tables and diners are squeezed into close quarters.  The noise level of the dining room was tinnitus inducing with thumping club music and a full house of diners practically screaming at each other trying to be heard over the unnecessarily loud music in a room with hard floors and walls unadorned with anything that could be considered sound dampening.  They only sound absorbing materials in the house were basically the diners and service staff.  I'm not too old that I can't or don't appreciate loud music and energetic crowds, but Beauty & Essex seemed to amp it up to an almost intolerable volume.  Not surprisingly, the combination of close quarters and cacophony resulted in service slips.  I noticed multiple cases where food runners delivered dishes to incorrect tables.  In fact, one of our dishes was delivered to a party two tables down from us.\n\nWe were more in need of food than more drinks, so we passed on selections from Beauty & Essex's appealing list of cocktails.  For our food, we shared orders of the Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche ($15), Roasted Bone Marrow ($19), and Garganelli ($22).  The Roasted Bone Marrow was a nicely sized portion of two big marrow-filled bones, which came with grilled bread and a rioja braised shallot marmalade as an accompaniment.  It was simple in its presentation, perfectly executed, and delicious.  On the other hand, the other two dishes were failures in presentation and\/or execution.  The ceviche tasted all right with bright mango notes complementing the fresh salmon, but it was lacking in execution and presentation.  The knife work on the salmon appeared sloppy.  If you eat first with your eyes, then it was difficult to differentiate between what was salmon and what was mango in the dimly lit room based on sight.  Exacerbating the issues with the dish was that the salmon was drowned in its \"cooking\" liquid and spooned into what amounted to be three Tostito Scoops, which became soggy, losing any hint of crispness.  Perhaps this dish needed to be eaten immediately upon being served.  However, this was the item that had been delivered to the wrong table.  The Garganelli, topped with a sweet & spicy lamb Bolognese and whipped ricotta, while edible, was not enjoyable.  The pasta was overcooked and didn't taste much, if any, better than overcooked, store bought, dried pasta.  The Bolognese was all sweet and little spice, unless you equate saltiness to spiciness, so much so we had to ask our server what was the sweet component in the dish.  It was a balsamic glaze.  Nevertheless, the sauce had a cloyingly sweet component that overpowered everything else save for salt.  It wasn't good.  We left our Garganelli unfinished after only our initial of bites.  We probably should've sent it back, but didn't because we'd had enough.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  Maybe we caught them on an off night.  The staff all seemed personable, attentive, and eager to please.   Other diners seemed to be enjoying themselves.  For whatever reason, Beauty & Essex was a swing and a miss and the biggest dining disappointment of our trip.  That said, I'd definitely be willing to give it another try, if only for their cocktails.
