So far I've had the madeleine and the biscotti. I liked both but thought they were just ok, the madeleine is honey but it just tasted like butter and it was a bit too dense for my liking. The biscotti's were good but I thought they tasted too much like the madeleines but sweeter, in dried form (which I guess must be what they are). They were also pretty expensive at $5.50 for a  small tub. The madeleine was $2.90. Prices I listed include tax. \n\nI would never ever wait in line for this. Reason I haven't gotten the cake yet is because it's big and I want to buy when I'm on my way home to share. I'm not sure how to keep it good so I'd like to finish it on the day I buy it. \n\nThe place is tiny! I never realized you couldn't eat there, it's only to go. Even though the hype is over, it's still only one cake per person. They also don't have lineups anymore. \n\nMake sure when you enter that you close the door right away, they have a very temperature sensitive operation when it comes to baking the cakes.
