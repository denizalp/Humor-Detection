I have been to Big Daddy's a few times. They have a cool looking store and a hipster vibe.  My first visit was okay... The employee working actually rented a movie to me before it's release date, oops! \n\nDuring my second visit the girl behind the counter was downright rude. She was snarky, sharp and short with her answers. Sorry that I bothered you to rent a DVD. \n\nMy girlfriend and I dropped in to rent  a video last night and the owner stopped us after we took a few steps inside. He then kicked us out because he decided to have a party for his friends in the store. Again, sorry that I bothered you to rent a DVD. \n\nWe won't be going back.
