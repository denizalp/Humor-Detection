4.5\/5\n\nI love browsing at oddities stores so I was excited to hear about this shop. Curious Nature channels more animal themed selections and sells items such as bones (Including an impressive selection of animal skulls),  taxidermy (Say hi to Princess Squirrel and the Jackalope for me if you visit), preserved animals in formalin, and a wall devoted to mounted and framed butterflies. Note that the butterflies lived out their natural lives and were only preserved after their death, an aspect much appreciated in my eyes. One of the many items that I thought was fascinating was a marble set made of preserved insects. \n\nThe shop itself is very well organized and I enjoyed looking at all the items for sale. \n\nThe one potential issue is that the parking lot is narrow with limited spots and most of them 30 minute parking only but since the shop itself is small we were done browsing within the 30 minutes.
