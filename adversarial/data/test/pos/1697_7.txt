This has to be one of the most over-rated coffee experiences in the city. The muffin was gross and stale (and strangely salty), and the espresso is pretty bitter. It was also rammed with hipsters using their laptops without coffee. Blah, Parkdale needs a Starbucks. \n\nBonus point for soy milk latte art!
