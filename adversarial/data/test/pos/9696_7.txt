Only after years of eating chain type sandwiches could I fully appreciate the quality and size of the sandwiches this place offers. I am a 6 foot 7 man who likes to eat good and cheap. The problem with most places is that they are more focused on the extras such as extra cheese or meat. \n\nNow I have always thought it was a scam to charge for something that you already paid for in the first place (extra cheese on a pizza). But when I go to a place that not only gives me more meat than there is bread I have to say yes!! This made up for all the overpriced, under sized, untasty sandwiches I have had to consume over the years. No more meatballs the size of a marble, or cold cuts that are coated in some kind of weird slime from sitting out to long. \n\nNo this place gives you what you order, a sub made of more meat than found in a whole deli counter (lol). I could care less about the cheap chairs or the location of the place, I just always wondered how they made any money with such huge portions at such low prices? The wings are good as everyone else has already stated and the pizza is tasty every time. If you are looking for a up scale place with cloth napkins, and waiters who see you as only a $5 tip then PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS Place!!! \n\nLet those who enjoy good, affordable food come here and feast on common fare. I am sure you will be to busy counting your millions to even make the drive to west Phoenix anyway.
