I won't say much about this place, because i only got cupcakes and some vegan jerky. I couldn't order lunch as i was getting on the rapid, and i don't wanna share my food with anyone. The menu looked pretty interesting though. The location right on Public Square is amazing. I can't imagine how they are making the rent just selling salads and soups. The lunch crowd has to be the bulk of their business. It's a cute space with a friendly staff. Non vegetarians should not fear this place. They won't burn sage in your face or try to tell your fortune with runes. It's not that hippie dippy kind of place.\n\nIt is great that health nuts have this option downtown. So suck up that bus exhaust, beam cell phone rays into your dome, sip some Splenda and enjoy your vegan burger.
