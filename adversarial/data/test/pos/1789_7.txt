The LINQ is definitely not my favorite Las Vegas hotel. The accommodations are sub-par at best.  The rooms are tiny.  We stayed in a two double sized beds room with a beautiful view of the HVAC system on the roof.  It was loud, very loud and there was a weird metal banging noise all night.  We weren't near the elevators so I don't know what it was.  \n\nThe hotel feel of the hotel felt like a never ending frat party on steroids.  I wasn't much of a partier, even in my early twenties so this really didn't appeal to me.  If you need more convincing, they literally have beer pong set up downstairs.\n\nThe hotel does not want to help you, they do not want to give you any human interaction. You are asked to check in and out at a kiosk and it makes the process confusing when you can't ask anyone about a lost key or about the self-parking charges.  I tried called the front desk to ask about the parking but it took three transfers for someone to tell me they didn't know.  You may as well just try to figure stuff out yourself.  \n\nI had forgotten some printed tickets for a concert so I needed to reprint them.  They do not have a business center and there are no complimentary computers to use if you need to print something.  Instead the charge a minimum of $5 to use a public computer and printer.\n\nThe only real thing this hotel has going for it is its location.  It is very centrally located on the strip which makes it very convenient.  We went to a concert at Caesar's so it was a very quick walk over.  We also walked both ways on the strip and it was easy to get in and out.  \n\nThe promenade also have a wide range of shops and is convenient for grabbing something to eat or walking around.\n\nThe hotel itself is dated, not well kept and very loud, even by Vegas standards but the location can't be beat for the price and would be the only reason I would stay again.
