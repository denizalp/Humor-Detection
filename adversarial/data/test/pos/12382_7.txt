Ok, ok, I take back what I said about their potato salad! They now offer Grandma's Potato Salad (it's ok, I'll eat it, but it just doesn't compare to the kind of stuff foodies should be eating or serving) and Not Your Grandma's Potato Salad. They almost named it after...me, but I'm not cool with false idolatry. I am but a man. \n\nHere's the deal. Someone from Deli emailed me yesterday and took to heart what I wrote about their tater salad. So...get this. The people at Deli scoured the internet to come up with the best homemade recipe they could find. Well, in the email, Maggie pleaded with me to come back and try their new potato salad. So in I went today. \n\nGoshdarn, people. It was tangy, creamy, the potatos were tender but not mushy, perfectly cooked, and it was full of hard-boiled eggs, spices, and...dill pickles. MMMMM.  And it's not only MMMMM, it's also unlike any other potato salad I have ever tried. Talk about a smashing and creative culinary success! Hails!\n\nNOW Deli has a potato salad to be proud of. Now Lawrenceville has a potato salad to be proud of. Break the Grandma's addiction L-Villians. You deserve better. And now you have better. So start buying some so Deli will keep making it. The world will be better for it. \n\nAs far as the sandwich I got, this time I went with the Chicken\/Artichoke Panini (you say panini, and I say panino...), and I was delighted. The provolone oooozed from the sandwich as I took each bite. It was even a little bit oily, which is good on my end. They should call it a Communion Wafer special, because...well if you're not Catholic, it means that it melts in the mouth (How many more ways can a reviewer say it?).  It was tender, goooey, the bread was perfectly toasted and crispy and chewy. Yes!\n\nAnd speaking of crispy, chewy Nirvana, the same could be said for their chocolate chip cookies. I got two and certainly have no regrets. They even have walnuts in 'em and are as good as they come. \n\nPlease stop by Deli on Butler Street (gotta love that post-modern name).  If nothing else, these folks certainly aim to please and hit the mark...that big bullseye on my tummy. \n\nI'm still thinkin' about that dern tater salad. Good job! Talk about new and improved.
