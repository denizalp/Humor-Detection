I have been here twice. And by \"been here\" I mean made it through the door and managed to stay for about 1 minute before we were met with the delightful attitude of the owner. I've never made it more than 3 or 4 feet into this cramped and overpriced store. \n\nThe first time we came in after grabbing some coffee from Dutch Bros next door. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly \"NO DRINKS ALLOWED!\" Since we obviously look like the spilling of drinks type, we moved along and did not return for about a year. I guess a simple \"can you please leave your drinks in your car\" or some other friendly solution was inconceivable! \n\nRecently, we reluctantly decided to give the store another shot since were out & about looking for mid-century treasures. This time we even left our coffee in the car, since we didn't want to be accosted by the owner. We entered. My husband saw something and asked the owner a question about it. The owner opened his mouth & gave him a snide remark. That's when we remembered how awful this man is.\n\nSo if you enjoy buying overpriced lamps from a giant prick, this is your place. However, there are several places in the valley with awesome finds that actually have a grasp on the value of customer service and aren't run by giant weiners. We decided to take our money elsewhere and bought a bunch of stuff from Modern Manor instead.
