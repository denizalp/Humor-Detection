Decor : 3.5 stars\nService : 2 stars\nFood : 3.2 stars\n\nLocated in a big plaza in Sahara Ave with lots of parking spots.\nWe originally wanted to eat at different Thai restaurant but we stumbled upon this place since they are known for their desserts.\n\nOur group consist with 4 adults and 2 kids.( 6 yr old and 2 yr old)\n\nWe quickly ordered our food since the kids were hungry and anyone knows kids can't wait for food so most of servers know to order kids food fast before adults food.( common sense)\n\nAll adults food came first and we kept waiting for the kids food and it end up arrived twenty minutes after our food came.\n\nThe food taste okay, nothing special. I wished I could try the dessert but I had no more room for sweets. \n\nThe bill was really surprised us since the server ' Luis' added tips on the bill even when our group were only four adults with two small kids.\n\nComing from NYC with a lot of restaurant experience, the tips usually added on party of 6 ( adults) and more. ( common sense that kids are not tipping)\nThe tip is gratuity based on service, so why on earth we got charged 18% for bad service?\n\nI was a bit embarrassed since I was the one suggested this place for dinner.\n\nIf you do try this place, check your bill when you get it and make sure you get good service before they charge tip on your bill.
