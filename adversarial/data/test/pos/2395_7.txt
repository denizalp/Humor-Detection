Extremely generous portioned and decently priced little spot for korean-mexican fusion food. They offer 5% off your bill if you pay cash. The food is made to order, but the wait isn't long at all. \nIt's a perfect place for cheese lovers, because a lot of the dishes are dripping with cheese that even I.. someone who doesn't eat dairy.. was drooling at the food. \nI got the kimchi fried rice, which was amazing. We also got the perfectly toasted beef grilled cheese which was so gooey and delicious.\nIt's a small drive from the strip, but worth the trip.
