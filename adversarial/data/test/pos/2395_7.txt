We started eating before we were at our table.  We helped ourselves to the roasted peanuts that seem to be everywhere in this restaurant.  The peanuts are roasted just right and have just enough saltiness.\n\nWhen we were seated we were brought some hot rolls fresh out of the oven.  They were so hot and fresh that we could barely pick them up.  They were served with room temperature butter - perfect for spreading - that had been mixed with a touch of cinnamon-sugar and I enjoyed 2 of these rolls.\n\nI next got a salad as one of my side dish choices.  I chose a Caesar salad.  They put out a rather nice Caesar salad.  I found the dressing to be flavorful but not overwhelming with fishiness as some Caesar dressing can be.\n\nI ordered a Blue Moon ale which they have on tap.  It is a nice, full bodied lager which I found quite satisfying.\n\nThe main course arrived and I enjoyed my second side item, baked beans.  They were somewhat heavy on BBQ sauce but made with hearty beans and plenty of chunks of flavorful pork.\n\nOh, they also brought out a slab of ribs, about 16 bones.  I ate one.\n\nIt was tender and delicious.  I'll eat the rest of the ribs tomorrow.
