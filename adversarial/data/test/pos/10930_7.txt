I come here for service for my car and service only. I will never purchase a vehicle from them as their selling techniques are intrusive and downright an unpleasant experience. \n\nTheir service department seems to have gotten better over the years and I can't find anything to disqualify that. If you need service and under warranty, come here and don't waste your time driving to whatever other dealership you bought your Toyota from.
