Didn't know I could get my ass whooped laying down for a massage. *I'm taking an Advil as I type this. I had a good experience until she started stepping on my back. LMAO!!!!! \n\nLady: \"is the pressure too hard?!\"\n\nMe: \"No...\"\n\n      ***what I'm really thinking: \n\"This b*tch thinks she weighs as much as a toddler, cause she's doing the damn electric slide on my back.\" \n\nBless her heart...\n\nI got the hot stones too & it was great! I was very relaxed afterwards. Overall good experience.
