Killingsworth is a great HVAC, pest, and carpet cleaning company. We have used them for years without trouble. We have the seasonal agreement for HVAC and they even change the filters and don't start a repair without giving you a complete cost. We have quarterly pest control and never see a bug. ( unless it's a fly we let in ourselves) Im testing the carpet cleaning next week but, judging from how other people's carpets look, I will be happy. Go on their website and check them out-coupons and specials too.
