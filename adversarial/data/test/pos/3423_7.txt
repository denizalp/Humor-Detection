As we approached, a mob of Toronto Blue Jay fans marched toward us under a single voice of, \"Blueeee Jays\" repeatedly.  Gulp.  Any apprehension we had was warranted because as San Diego Padre fans and in \"enemy\" territory we had every reason to think twice.  Fortunately, we weren't wearing anything friar-like.  No blue. No brown. No yellow.  This ain't the 80s.  Then just like that, they all rolled as a unified blue mob into Bier Markt.  \n\nWe followed in with them and instantly felt welcomed.  For those that are familiar, the closest comparison would be Yard House in the States with the many, many taps of beer.  Similarly, Bier Markt does better because it focuses on being a beerpub (A Taste OF EUROPE!) than trying to be a restaurant with beer as an after thought.  But of course, they do serve food also.  We unfortunately didn't try the food as were intent on and not disappointed in pickling our livers with the fast and friendly bartend service.\n\nInterestingly, the entire staff all wear the French classic black Lacoste polo shirts.  The crocodile logo is unmistakeable.  Dig it.
