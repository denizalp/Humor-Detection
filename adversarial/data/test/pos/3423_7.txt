This was the cutest wine store!  I loved it.\n\nI went there for an event, so I really was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere of the store.  (I thought it was going to be more of a restaurant...I obviously know NOTHING!)  The wine was great, the staff was very friendly, and I just thought the place was cute.  Cute Cute Cute.\n\nI also love the t-shirts that were available for sale...\"Women Taste Better\"  I love it!
