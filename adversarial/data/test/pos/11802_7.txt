Great Choice \n\nWe needed a place for a late lunch, and GrassRoots Kitchen and Tap sounded good, so off we went. GrassRoots offers a were good selection of entrees on the menu and all of us were happy with our choices, and beverages. \n\nThe atmosphere at Grassroots Kitchen and Tap is realaxing and inviting. We decided to eat outside in order to avoid a wait and to take advantage of one of the rare occasions when you can eat on the patio in Phoenix, Arizona, in October and be comfortable .\n\nMy friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some of the \" Hawaiian Sweet Roll Sliders\"  and the \"Boat Load of Wings\".  Both of these appetizers were excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the wings, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.\n\nAs an entree I ordered the Roasted Chicken Walnut Salad Sandwich.  It was quite good.  My lunch companions had the Angus hamburger, Almost Famous Pork Chop, and Southern Shrimp and Grits\nThe shrimp and grits had grilled shrimp over jalape√±o cheddar grits with tasso ham relish and grilled focaccia slices. I have to say, the grits were absolutely amazing. Honestly, all our entrees were equally delicious.\n\nThe service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.
