I've been coming here for the past eight years or so and I began going here when the place was still known as Payton's. Since the new ownership took over they replaced all of the old TVs with high definition flat screens so now all of the games look great! They also improved the patio by adding a canopy which covers the entire area so that the sun doesn't interfere with with the picture of the TVs as well as making the patio area much more bearable during the early part of football season. The beer selection is exceptional with a wide variety of domestics and imports. However, an easing on the price would be much appreciated. The bartenders are efficient and make solid drinks. The menu is for the most part identical to the one that Payton's had with a few additions and omissions, and the salad line-up is stellar. Overall the food is good especially compared to other sports bars and the chefs have been consistently good. The entire staff is friendly, efficient, and helpful. This season we've had a strong turn out on the \"Saints\" patio, which mirror the Saints performance I might add. For the second season in a row we've been fortunate enough to have Alexis looking after us outside. She's as stunning as the Saints offence, has the eyes of Audrey Tatou, and I think I'm in ****! In conclusion, I spend the entire football season at this place and I've never been disappointed. This is one of the choice bars to watch sports in the valley.
