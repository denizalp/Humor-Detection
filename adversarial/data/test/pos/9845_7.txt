I visited the outside alcoholic slushy bar and peeked in the gambling floor. There are dancing girls on top of counters and tables in red fringe. This was one of the nicer spots that is downtown. It is one of the newer locations. \n\nI paid $24 for a fruit punch slushy in a plastic football shaped container. I didn't taste any alcohol and didn't feel buzzed, so I am skeptical on the quality of their service. I am afraid, like most things in Vegas, that I was being ripped off. The drink filled me up and gave me gas, but did not serve its purpose. It was nice to have something cold to drink in the extreme heat.
