Burger Priest (owners and fans) - pay attention: THIS is how it's done!!!\n\nPerfectly cooked beef and lamb burgers. Juicy, great seasonings with outstanding attention to flavour and texture combinations with the toppings. A perfect, flavourful bun that hold up to the burger and toppings without overwhelming the flavour of the fresh ground meat. \n\nGreat fries; fresh cut, lightly seasoned and served with a brilliant aoili.\n\nFinally, the staff genuinely believes in their food and cares that you enjoy it. They are as emotionally invested in the food as are people who really care about quality and originality.\n\nThe words on the wall as you leave say it all: \"You'll be back!\" Yes we will!!!
