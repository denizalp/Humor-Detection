The best Korean food I've found in Las Vegas. This is a family operated business, and you can feel how passionate they are from the food they put out and the way they take care of patrons.\n\nTheir menu is a mix of traditional and contemporary Korean cuisine. Both styles they execute perfectly. They have a true sense of pride in everything they put out. They go the extra mile and make all their own side dishes and soy sauce.\n\nDo yourself a favour and go there, get a drink, order a couple things. You won't regret it.
