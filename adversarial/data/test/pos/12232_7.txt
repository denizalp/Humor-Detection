Ran through their drive through last Thursday. The employee working the window seemed to speak english perfectly but kept asking me to repeat the order. (it happens so whatever, thought nothing of it despite the fact I only ordered one item).\n\nAfter the 3rd time, he said \"pull up\". I pulled up to the window and had my card ready but was surprised to see said employee chatting away on his cell phone. He didn't say anything to me, not even my total and because I was dumb enough to have my cc ready in my hand out the window, he yoinked it and promptly charged it and continued chatting away on his cell phone IN FRONT OF ME.\n\nI'm a cell phone whore just as much as the next person but I have the decency to know when and where this is appropriate. THIS WAS NOT THE TIME\/PLACE, DUHHH much???\n\nI stared down said employee thinking \"surely, he MUST be getting off the phone to actually, ya know, provide SERVICE?\" He eventually walked into the back out of sight, still never having said ANYTHING, not even \"you want salsa?\".\n\nAt least when I go across the street to Filiberto's, they have the decency to 1) give me a bloody freaking total and 2) ask me if I want some fu***** hot sauce. \n\nI'm not expecting a 5 star level of service (I'm realistic, not stupid) but stuff like this makes me want to shove cell phones up the employee's  noses. \n\nI won't be back.
