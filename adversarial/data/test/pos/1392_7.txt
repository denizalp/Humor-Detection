Great food, nice wine options.... Excellent service!!! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there seemed to be a lot of older gentleman with questionable looking women, by that I mean.. I don't think that they were wives or girlfriends!!! I have a friend who visited on a separate occasion and said she had noticed the same thing.
