Yumster in my Tumster!  So I go to the PPC downtown and it's wonderful.  A popcorn haven - sweet, salty, spicy, tangy - oh the flavors are endless!  I tend to always get the Wisconsin cheddar but the Caramel popcorn is delish.  This stuff is better than Garrett's popcorn in Chicago...and that's some serious poppin corn in that joint - fo' real.  \n\nSo if you're looking for a snickety snack check this place out because it's AAAAWWWWESOME!
