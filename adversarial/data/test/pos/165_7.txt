I visited North Hills Auto Mall with my son, looking for his first car. I was extremely disappointed.\n\nI do not know where they took their on-line car photos, but it was NOT at their own site.  Go onto google maps and have a look at the satellite image for yourself.\n\nThe one-lane gravel path in\/out was blocked by one of their cars, hood-up, being worked on by two or three of the employees.  They were throwing sparks with a hand-grinder on something under the hood.  The \"office\" is a trailer, and the \"garage\" is an open-air, car-port-thing, with rusty tools and parts lying around.  This did not give me the feeling that these cars were all in great mechanical condition. \n\nThe \"auto mall\" itself is just a gravel parking lot.  Cars are stacked in at least four-deep, nose-to-tail.  If you want to test-drive a car (we drove two), be prepared to wait several minutes while they find another car-jockey and start moving cars around to get your pick out.  It's so congested, they have to drive it off the lot and around the corner, before switching so you can drive.\n\nThe cars we saw were in medium condition, many with small dents, broken trim, and badly faded bumpers.  One Honda CRV we drove had a broken-off inside door handle on the driver's door, wrapped in duct-tape so the remaining stub would not cut the driver's hand.\n\nThe second test drive started with the employee stating \"I need to fill this with gas for you...\" so my son and I had to endure a multi-mile drive to a far away gas station, while the employee surfed on his smart-phone in one hand, while wandering left-of-center with the other.\n\nWhy did he need to use such a far away gas station?  Because he was also PICKING UP HIS DAUGHTER!  So our test-drive included an additional teen-aged guest.  How professional.\n\nWith behavior like this, a setting like this, and business practices like I saw, I cannot warn you strongly enough to stay away from North Hills Auto Mall.\n\nI hate to post such a negative report, but I feel obligated.  I shopped there in good faith and gave it a chance.  We were real buyers, and did buy a car elsewhere a week later.
