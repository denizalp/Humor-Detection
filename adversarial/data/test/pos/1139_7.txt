After Being A LOYAL CUSTOMER of ROGERS for over 15yrs ROGERS CAN NOW KISS MY ASS! I HOPE THIS COMPANY GOES FROM SOMETHING TO NOTHING AND THE OWNER HAS TO COMMIT SUICIDE!\n  \nI just got off the phone with THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT since I've had to deal with their \"WORST IN HISTORY\" Customer Service And Tech Department! My problems have been going on for the last 4 YEARS and they haven't been able to correct it, but have been able to bill me HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS and then turn to say: \"Well at this point it doesn't look like we can make you happy in what we provide\" LMFOA You ass's cant provide what you say you can and bill people for, then turn it around and put it on the CUSTOMER WTF is wrong with you REJECTS?\n\nToday is July 25, 2012\n  Got a Call From The Presidents Office Today And The Person Asks Me What My Concerns Were, So I Told Him How I Was A Loyal Customer And Am About To Take My MONEY Elsewhere If My Issues WEREN'T FIXED AFTER TALKING TO HIM!  I Went On To Tell Him How I'm Not Happy With The Service That I've Been Paying with all the Avg Ping Times Of Up To 970ms And As High Of 29%Packet Loss, All The Lies That I've Gotten From Customer Service All The Way Up To Managers (YES MANAGERS THAT LIE)!\nHe Then Goes On To Say That He Has Looked Into My Acct And Sees That Their Techs Don't Seem To Detect Anything Wrong With My Service!  He Also Says \"It Seems That We Cant Make You Happy For Your Gaming Needs And With What They Provide, So Maybe I Should Look Elsewhere! This Made Me Out Raged So I Told Him To Make Sure My F****** Service Was Completely Gone In 7 Days When My Contract Is Up! I Hung Up And He Try's To Call Me Back Several Times NO F****** WAY! DIE IN YOUR SLEEP!\n\nI'm Paying For Extreme High Speed!\n\nJuly 21, 2012\n The Tech (That I And The CONNECTIVITY SPECIALIST From MICROSOFT) Booked For Today Shows Up (NOW I HATE THE COCKY I'M BETTER THEN YOU TYPE)  And Asks me WHAT MY PROBLEM WAS AND WHY HES HERE TODAY, I Told Him WHY Am I Having To Tell Him His JOB? When The Office Books You For A Call DON'T They INFORM YOU What The Issues Are Before You Show Up To A Customers Home\/Apartment Ect???? Anyhow I Mentioned To Him How Just The Night Before I Was Getting A 13% Packet Loss And Its Been Up To 29% Packet Loss. I Mention How Microsoft And I Have Been Running Ping Tests For The Last Few Months And When It Comes Down To The MIN, MAX, AVG We Were Seeing Min(s) From 9ms To 133  Max(s) From 20  To 970  And  Avg(s) From 11ms To 137\nThis Loser Turns Around And Tells Me That a 13% Packet Loss Is Normal And My Times Are Pretty Good, OH NO HE DIDN'T, I Looked At Him Raised My Voice And Said \"REALLY DUDE A 13% LOSS IS NORMAL? YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR FUCKIN JOB WTF ARE YOU DOING IN THE IT DEPARTMENT, I TURN AND WALK INTO MY BEDROOM SAYING TO MYSELF OUT LOUD THIS GOOF DOESN'T KNOW SHIT AND THESE ARE THE ASS'S ROGERS HIRES! A Few Seconds Later I Walk Out Of My Room And He Tells Me Hes Going Outside To Look At The Wires, So I Say Go Ahead I Just Want My SHIT FIXED PROPERLY AND FINALLY! After About 25min After He Leaves I Get A Call From Someone Saying He Is The Manager Of The TECH That Was At My House And What My PROBLEM WAS? I TOLD HIM HIS UNEDUCATED TECH DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HES TALKING ABOUT AND RIGHT AWAY ASKED HIM HOW A 13% LOSS WAS NORMAL, THIS FRUIT-LOOP TELLS ME THAT WHAT DO I WANT FROM THEM IF THE INFORMATION THEY ARE PROVIDING ME IS CORRECT BUT JUST NOT CORRECT TO ME? REALLY? REALLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY? 13% Packet Loss Is Normal REALLLLYYYYYYYY? So I Told Him Off And Hung Up On His DUMB ASS And Went To Rogers Home Page To Look Into Getting A Hold Of Someone In The Presidents Office!\n\n\nMORE TO COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
