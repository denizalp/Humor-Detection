I use to be a member a few months ago and I left. Staff are great but the gym itself is lacking. Machines dont get fixed for a long time, the mens changing rooms, steam and jacuzzi is full of naked old men. Nobody wheres trunks or shorts in the steam or jacuzzi which i thinks disgusting. Most machines are bent or twisted. If you want to a place to talk and where everybody is friendly its great, if you want to work out hard, go elsewhere.
