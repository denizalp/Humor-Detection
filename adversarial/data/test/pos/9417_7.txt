I never go here for healthcare.. But.. I don't always have bathroom access at work.  So sometimes if I'm in the area I'll slide through and use the facilities.  Nice clean stalls up on floor 3 or 4 and a good cell signal so I don't mind kicking back and surfing the net for a bit.  Don't be afraid to park in the garage and take the pedestrian bridge over if the weather is foul, it's free!  Hey, not much in life is free so we should enjoy it where we can, even if it's just the can!
