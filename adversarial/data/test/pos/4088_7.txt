I regret moving into these Apartments. It is not safe, i would say some type of crime happens here every couple weeks. If you live on the top floor, the airplanes passing by gets really loud. If you live in the middle floors, it is so thin you can hear your neighbors, and if you live on the first floor you will get robbed. Don't let the sales people fool you, they are the worst property management group I have ever dealt with.
