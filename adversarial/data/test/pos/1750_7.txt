Remember the movie Coyote Ugly? If you've ever wanted to go to a place that's similar to the bar in that film, this is your opportunity. \n\nIf you're looking for scantily clad bartenders who at times will be dancing or hula hooping on the bar, strong drinks, and a chill atmosphere, The Dirty Dogg is where you will find it. \n\nThe Dirty Dogg styles itself as a biker, dive bar, but c'mon, you're still in Scottsdale so while there might be Harleys parked outside and guys wearing biker gear inside, it's more likely they are stockbrokers, lawyers, and real estate investors playing dress up. To stick with the movie analogies, it's more Wild Hogs than The Wild One.  \n\nEither way, it's still a fun place to have a good time and different than most other places in Scottsdale. Enjoy!
