Food was delicious. I had a number one (my favorite that I ate everywhere in Japan) and it was on point. I liked that I could do whatever toppings I wanted so I got exactly what I wanted. My husband got a number 10 and ate almost every bite. Only thing I would mention is to go early- most of the sides like rice balls and gyoza are all made at the beginning of the shift so they run out quickly and do not replenish. Otherwise, gets a  from us.
