It was very good, but one of our poutines came out wrong. The building has a modern setup and design, very well done with a small outdoor seating area. The staff were great, helpful and happy. They have a \"build your own\" poutine option, which looks fun, but can get pricey quickly. We got the house poutine which was great. The red-wine gravy was fresh and unique, and the shredded beef was perfectly cooked, not dried out. We also got the Philly cheese-steak poutine which wasn't as good. Looking back at the menu, I realized they forgot to put cheese curds and the gravy on it, which would have changed everything!! All we got was the nacho cheese on it, which was overbearing - mixing it with cheese curds and gravy would have balanced it out. I didn't realize it at the restaurant, only just noticed it by re-reading their menu on the website.
