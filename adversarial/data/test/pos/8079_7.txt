I've dined at Camp Social a few times before and have held off on writing a review. Each time the service is highly lacking and I chalked it up to the owners just needing to work the kinks out. However, after a Friday work lunch last week it's clear there really is an issue here. \n\nOur server started off great and promptly greeted our group of five to get our drink orders. We put in an appetizer order, which arrived in a timely manner. However, 50 minutes after we had put our main course order in, we still had yet to receive our meals. Now I know things happen in a kitchen. But our server came by multiple times to refill our waters and didn't say a word about the long wait time. We would have appreciated some acknowledgement about the status of our order, especially since we needed to get back to work. \n\n\nThe food itself is usually pretty good. This time we tried the Brussels sprouts appetizer, carne Asada fries, and the salmon Hayek (lol) sandwich. I'm usually not a big fan of themed restaurants but I think Camp Social does it really well. I do hope they can figure it out in the service department though, or I don't see them lasting for much longer.
