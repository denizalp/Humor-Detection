I'm not angry with Mickies, just sorely disappointed.\n\nA group of us came to Mickies after hearing so many great reviews. We were promptly seated by a sweet employee who was willing to accommodate our party of 10. Unfortunately, the service went exponentially downhill from there once we were given a different employee as our server.\n\n1. Our server was not friendly at all. She rushed to gather our order in as quickly as possible--this was understandable considering the morning rush, but it certainly did not make for a welcoming experience.\n\n2. Our server gave us attitude because we pointed out that she gave us the wrong plate order. I was sharing my plate with a friend who is vegetarian; however, the server gave us a plate with sausage and gravy on top. The upsetting part wasn't that she made a mistake, but that she insinuated that WE were wrong when she said \"You ordered second, so you get the second plate.\" (We ordered first, by the way.) After we were able to flag her down to explain that we did not order meat, she realized that she had given our plate to someone else at our table, and expected us to switch the plates after they had already eaten half of their plate! She rolled her eyes and left, without apology, as if WE were burdening her for HER mistake and wanting to get a new, uneaten plate.\n\n3. We went to go pay for our meal and the cashier had charged us for a plate that SOMEONE ELSE in our party had ordered. We pointed this out and, instead of owning up to his mistake, he told us that since someone else had paid for our plate, we had to pay for the other person's more expensive meal. When we told him that we should be paying for the meal that WE ordered, he shrugged us off with the gall to say, \"that's just how it is,\" and made us pay the extra money for the mistake that he made.\n\nWe understand that mistakes happen and that things get busy. However, it is NOT unreasonable for us to expect to be treated decently; to not be blamed for wanting the service that we paid for; and for them to simply own up and apologize for your mistakes. I sincerely believe our dining experience could have been considerably better if the employees had simply apologized and owned up to their mistakes. Instead, we left with a guilt trip for the mistakes that were made by their employees and felt incredibly disrespected.\n\nTL;DR: several mistakes were made, no one apologized, they made us pay more than what we ordered
