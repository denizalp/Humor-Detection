Tried unsuccessfully twice on line to reserve ride home from airport, so had to call in. Told rep I tried to book on line and asked why $3 more than price I saw. Said payment fee. Asked to waive and rep did. Asked if I could pay driver cash, said No, cashless drivers. Whole ride home hearing high pitch whirling. My first experience with Super Shuttle and not likely to use again. Tried to check in on arrival got error message so maybe website glitch but was 25 min wait after checking curb side.
