I had two lattes in a span of about 20 minutes.  For me that's a lot of caffeine and yes I was feeling great for a while after that.  \n\nI was meeting a friend for a quick coffee and I passed right by the place and didn't realize till I got to Chat Time that I had passed it.  This place is basically just a coffee bar through a door that leads to a dark book storage room.  \n\nThis place has just a bar, a barista and somethings that make you feel as if you're in a lab.  Coffee samples for smelling are in test tubes.  Complimentary water is served to you in tiny beakers.  Your coffee is however made not with a chemistry set but rather a professional grade espresso machine.  \n\nI'm not a coffee lover like my wife but I have to say the two lattes I had were great.  I was offered Panamanian beans but also Colombian for another 50 cents.  I ended up going with the Colombian not that I'd really be able to tell the difference but hey, that's something a little different and I had a choice.\n\nThere are a few signs outside south as a painted concrete strip outside as well as a large white cup that is a large version of their real cups as well as a phone booth with their name on it.  \n\nDon't miss this tiny place.  There's no place to sit so it's basically always to go.  They offer discounts for University of Toronto students or faculty.
