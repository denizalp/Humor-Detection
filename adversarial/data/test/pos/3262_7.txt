It really couldn't have been any better.  \n\n-Groupon (check)\n-Cool unpretentious waiter (check)\n-Live music (check)\n-Amazing menu (double check)\n\nWe ventured over to 5th & Wine a few weeks ago after buying our Groupon online for $15 bucks (for $30 worth of food) and haven't stopped talking about it since.  We're not really wine drinkers (craft beer is more our style), so we decided to just focus on the food and order as much as our little stomachs could handle.  Here's what we got and why it was so fabulous:\n\n-Bruschetta.  Next time we go back I think I want to order nothing but the bruschetta, it was that good.  Melt in your mouth savory and soft and just all around a perfect explosion of both texture and flavor.  We only got four of the eight bruschetta offerings, (Apples and brie, Peppercorn steak and horseradish, Tomato basil and mozzarella, and Prosciutto and fig) but each and every one that we tried left our mouth watering.\n\n-5th & Wine burger.  We asked our waiter about this burger, and he said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  We took this comment with a grain of salt since he works for the joint, but after we sank our teeth into the juicy beast ourselves, we realized how right he was.  It was a damn good burger, well deserving of praise.  The fries on the side were also finger lickin' good and we gobbled up every last one of those perfectly fried taters.\n\n-Tomato and Mozzarella panini.  It was everything I thought a panini could be, and more. Crispy on the outside and gooey guts of tomato and cheese on the inside, this was one tasty sandwich, and the side of minestrone soup hit the spot as well.\n\nI wish other mediocre establishments would observe and take notes from this place on how to run a successful restaurant in the valley.  The food, the service and the atmosphere are all impeccable, and unlike some other places, they don't make you pay for valet parking or dress like a wannabe hipster to fit in and look cool (I'm looking at you Postino).
