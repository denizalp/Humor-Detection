I didn't want to be the first person to give this place four stars instead of five... and I can be pretty harsh when it comes to rating pizza.  Sooo... thank goodness I loved the pizza!  \n\nI had the Toto (it had sausage, salami, prosciutto, and something else on it)... and it was absolutely deee-lish!  They present it nicely on a large plate and then bring out everything an Italian or non-Italian could want to add to their pizza -- red pepper, oregano, parm, and I think a spicy olive oil.  The pizza was extremely tasty without any of that, but because I always know better than everyone else (even the chef), I went and made it even better :)\n\nMy dinner companion (my mommy) had the Pomo.  It was the typical supreme- type ingredients (S, M, O, G)... and while I didnt taste her pizza, I did hear one of the most negative people I know only say good things about it... so it musta beena gooda!  And sorry about that last comment, mom!\n\nAs for the canoli, well, not as great as the pizza by any means... but who am I to knock off a star because the dessert couldn't measure up to the wonderfulness of the main entree.  I wouldn't get the canoli (actually three little canolis) again, but they had a bunch of other desserts worth trying.
