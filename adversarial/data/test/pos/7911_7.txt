just use bountiful baskets or go to Safeway....same prices (if not cheaper).  boxed greens has better prices.  if you can make it down to their warehouse on Fridays they sell everything you can fit in a box for $20!!!  Quality has gone so far down over the last year there, that I will NEVER use them or recommend them to anyone.  Boxes are reused and have foot prints on them.  GROSS!  Ask them if any of them have food handlers cards!!!!!!!!!!
