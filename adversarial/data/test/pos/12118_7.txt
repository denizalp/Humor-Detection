We've been coming and staying at Bally's the past 13 years. I've been a big advocate given it's location on the strip, reasonable prices, and friendly staff. However, I doubt we will be staying at Bally's again given our last trip. Not only was the service lackluster - the staff seemed miserable, from everyone from the bartenders to the dealers - which made it the opposite of pleasurable for the guests. This is in contrast to past years, so have to assume there was a change in management. Additionally, they got rid of our favorite slot machines!!! (Willy Wonka, Batman & Robin, Gremlins, Monopoly - so we went to other casinos to find them.)  But the biggest reason is that, for the first time, I felt UNSAFE staying at Bally's. 3 times over the weekend I was approached\/harassed by strangers in the Bally's casino, in the early hours of the morning, while playing slot machines:\n\n- Incident #1: approached by 2 black men, one on either side of me, while playing near the Buffalo slots at the wall. One was in his 20s and the other in his 40s. Initially, the younger man asked for a cigarette and thought was just being friendly. But then his partner joined and they were drilling me with questions, until eventually they asked if me or any of my friends wanted to buy drugs. After saying no thank you and them not leaving, I finally cashed my play and walked away. That said, the casino is not that big and I had no idea if they stuck around of not.\n\n- Incident #2: approached by a man of middle-eastern descent in his late 30s\/early 40s by the slots on the upper level; I was playing the Picnic one. He sat down next to me and started asking if I was single. When I showed him my wedding ring, he would not leave and proceeded to ask if I wanted to leave with him. Disgusted, I got up and walked away, but again, he creepily hung around the slots so I just left.\n\n- Incident #3: approached by a white man in his late 50s\/early 60s at the older slots over by the new Buffalo ones. He asked if I'd been having luck, I said no and went back to my game. He was very close to me\/up in my personal space, and said he saw someone win 100k on that machine that morning. I said great, without even looking at him. Then he said something strange like 'why don't you take your money and I'll show you.' I then aggressively said, \"I'm not interested\" and he finally walked away. I was shaken up, and scared he was going to follow me up to my room. My heart was beating so fast.  \n\nIn all 3 instances, security was NOWHERE to be found.  It's unfortunate that a place we used to love, and \nstarted\/ended our nights at, was drastically different this year. I've never before felt unsafe gambling on my own in Bally's, after my husband went upstairs to bed.  Not only will I never do that again in Bally's, but is doubtful we'll ever stay there again.
