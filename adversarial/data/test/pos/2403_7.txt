So we just left Treasures on our last night in Vegas. We had a party bus drop us off for no charge and the two drink minimum was fine and easily understandable. Drinks were strong. The girls were sweet and very talented. So why the two stars?\n\nMy beau went up to a girl to try to get his friend a dance and on his way up, he accidentally dropped his winnings from earlier that night. Before I had a chance to even say anything, a girl ran over and picked it up and ran back to some dude's lap. I confronted her about it and she was about to give it back to me when some senior stripper told me \"any money on the floor is fair game\". And the girl stuck the money back in her purse.\n\nI was having an absolutely amazing time until then. We left right after that, there's no reason to give any more money to thieves. \n\nWatch your back when you're there.
