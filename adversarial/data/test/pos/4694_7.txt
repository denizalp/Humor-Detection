We call this Gay Denny's or Jenny's. \n\nIt's really like any other Denny's. There's no reason for you to drive to this one because it makes more sense to go to the one in your neighborhood. Usually, we go to this one when there's an event in Downtown Phoenix. It's nearby.\n\nOther reasons that I go? My friends are poor and Denny's open late. Otherwise, you should never eat at Denny's.
