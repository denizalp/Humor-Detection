My husband and I went to ABC today to grab dessert. We were disappointed that they closed early since it was a slow day for them, but totally understandable since it's a family run business. Luckily, one of the owners opened up the door and said we were welcome to come in and get desert to go. My husband had a chocolate peanut butter cake and I had the lemon meringue. They were to die for!!! We cannot wait to go back to try more there, and the owners were really sweet to open back up for us!!
