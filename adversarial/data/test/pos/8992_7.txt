To start off with, I've worked in the service industry for 4 years, so not only am I more lenient than most, but I know what they're going through. \n\nThis place was the worst. We had a group of people there (maybe 20 or so). They would a) NOT split the bills and b) only allowed us to pick from a fixed menus. \n\nFirstly, not splitting bills is amateur - almost every restaurant worth anything nowadays has a system that makes this incredibly easy. And I mean regular, run of the mill restaurants would have this. \n\nSecondly, I understand the fixed menu thing - it creates for less confusion and people getting their food at the same time. However, charging $45\/ person and only giving you TWO options (pasta and pizza) is awful. Not to mention, the two options that probably have the highest markup. The pizza was alright, the pasta (my wife's) was awful. \n\nTheir only - and I mean ONLY - thing that was good was their shrimp in their calamari, that earned them the one star. My wife's $16 house wine glass took about 30 minutes to make it to the table, my water (not a drinker) was often empty. \n\nAt the end of the night, they do not tell you that tip is included (I'm a pretty generous tipper anyways, as I worked in the industry and you have to be AWFUL to get my standard 15%). So I ended up tipping twice due to the confusion. \n\nYou couldn't pay me to go back to that place. Would recommend to my enemies.
