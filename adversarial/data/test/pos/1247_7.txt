Kyoto continues to be a rockin' good time! Every time I visit, Kyoto provides an activity dinner experience! Between the saki bombs, the entertaining chef and the good food, Kyoto has the tri-fecta. Be warned that on the weekends, you will experience a wait, so it's best to call ahead and make a reservation.
