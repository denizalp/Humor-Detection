If you want super super sweet (one that will almost give you diabetes), non-fluffy donuts, then this is your place to be. The donuts in this place is OVERLY SWEEEET!!! Almost hard to swallow sweet! I was very disappointed. Not what I have in mind when it comes to donuts. The dough was not fluffy at all and very dense!  \n\nSorry but you might as well just go to another place and spend your money somewhere else in order to find that original, fluffy, just the right amount of sweetness kind of donut when it comes to your local donut place.
