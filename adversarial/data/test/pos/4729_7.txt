By far my favorite Costco, here's why. \nThey open at 7 am, which makes it super convenient to stop by after I drop off my kid at school or before I head to work. \nThey don't have books, clothes, seasonal aisle, toys, movies, prepared food, rotisserie chicken, food court- all the things that jam the aisles and parking lots at regular Costco with slow moving patrons and their sample loving kids. Here everyone is in a hurry and on a mission. \nThe selection IS different. It's a business Costco, so you can stock up on crates instead of bags of produce and cases instead of family packs of meat. I likes having the option, even though I may not buy a whole lamb every shopping trip. They have a whole restaurant equipment section and all the goodies a convenience store owner might need to stock shelves. It's fun to actually just come in once to experience something very different.\n The things people tend to complain about- they close early, 6 pm on weekdays and they are closed Sundays. They DON'T participate in same promo book other Costcos do, BUT they do run their own specials. The lines are short, but you have a really good chance of getting stuck behind a flatbed filled with bags of grated cheese, enormous bags of charcoal or a seeming lifetime supply of napkins- plenty of restaurants, eateries and food trucks do stock up here. I have seen staff from Lola's, H&H BBQ and  our fabulous mayor Carolyn Goodman in line before. \nThe best thing- where else can you get a view of Downtown from Costco parking lot? It's practically a tourist attraction.
