I used this company to help move a pinball machine upstairs, as every billiard or slot machine store I called were either too busy, too disorganized, or just had minimal interest in helping me.  \n\nI called and received a quote, with a time given that they would arrive. Keep in mind, this was not a 4-5 hour time window that would require me to take an entire day off of work. It was an exact time, making my life much, much easier.\n\nThey used a crew of three movers, who were extremely careful every step of the way. They even helped me with setup, which they weren't really required to do.  \n\nI'm not moving anytime soon, but I'd definitely use them again in the future for some heavy duty help!
