I definitely wasn't in Kansas anymore!!!  Holy shit, ladies.  If you want a genuine Vegas male stripper experience, I truly recommend Men of Sapphire for all your oiled up, muscled needs.  They went above and beyond, from the moment I bought my ticket online through Paypal until our group of 6 bridesmaids and 1 bride left the club.\n\n$50 + tax gets you the \"Girl's Night Out\" package- complimentary transportation to the club, front of the line admission, VIP seating guaranteed, and a private table for your group.  We also received a free round of shots for purchasing through Paypal.  A guest representative contacted me via email within a day or 2 after I purchased my ticket.  She asked if I was part of a party or going solo.  I let her know I was part of a bachelorette party and the maid of honor would be the contact person.\n\nSomeone from the club was extremely communicative with the MOH for our transportation.  Unfortunately one bridesmaid's flight was delayed, and we missed our pickup time.  The club was VERY gracious enough to return an hour later for our pickup (from the Paris hotel) and still honored our complimentary transportation.  We arrived in a super glam party bus, were greeted at the door with no wait in line, and were escorted through the club to the back room where all the male goodness awaited us.  Talk about feeling muy importante!  We were seated at a table where the stage and catwalk connect, and our bride looked up in awe for the whole 2 hours.  When we were ready to leave, someone at the door made sure we had transportation back to our next adventure (not free).\n\nNot only do you get 2 hours of showtime, but there's a variety of men strutting around waiting to dance for you ($20\/dance).  Our server was great about checking on us, but he wasn't so excited once the table dried up and I only ordered a soda.  I guess that's the nature of the business, but hey, I wanted that soda for my shot chaser!  We never saw him again, and that was our cue to leave.\n\nPerfect service, perfect seating, perfect company, and ridiculously talented men on the pole :-D
