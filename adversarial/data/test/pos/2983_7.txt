I wanted a Groupon for this but couldn't find it! If any other other yelpers can tell me what to search for, I'd like to do that deal next time.\n\nPure Aloha Fest was a nice experience. We just moved up to Vegas from Oahu two months ago and the homesickness hasn't really set in, but the food cravings definitely have! I felt like we were back home again at this event. \n\nChoke vendors and food. If you want it, they pretty much have it, right down to the fresh cracked coconut. My bf just broke his Locals slippers (the kine from Longs) and they didn't have those though lol. Oh well. \n\nI got my manapua\/pork hash fix, and we had some ono shave ice from a vendor called Hapa Haole. Prices are kind of insane, but you pay for the \"imported goods\" and the fact that you're supporting local.  $3 for a can of Hawaiian sun juice?! You know you aren't in Hawaii anymore haha. I wish there was a Kamaaina discount or something, since the festival runs three days and $8\/person is a little steep just for entry when prices inside are high too. 50th state fair doesn't even charge that much. Minus one star for the expensive factor. \n\nThere are also lots of clothing booths and some crafts and they even had an actual tattoo booth. With permanent ink and needles. Pretty nuts.\n\nLive entertainment, local food, and lots of aloha vibes; I'm glad we came out for this!
