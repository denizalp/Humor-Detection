When I ate here one Saturday in July I was the only person eating at Monta Noodles House. Today at lunch there were only seats open at the bar. Oh the power of YELP is almighty! \n\nYes the ramen is delicious and the broth is soo yummy. It's so yummy and damn addicting I was urning for more as I stared at my empty bowl of what use to be my bowl tonkotsu ramen. \n\nNext time I'll order the extra noodles or maybe an egg!
