Pizza cooked in a coal oven? I've heard of brick oven and wood fire, but coal? Ok I'll give it a shot.\n\nWOW DELISH! Some of the best pizza I have EVER had! Who knew this fossil fuel could help produce heavenly bites of pizza?!\nI went at lunch time and was promptly sat at the bar. The place is a little small so I can imagine the wait time at peak hours can be long. The bartender was nice and since it was my first time, he explained the menu and how the pizza is made. I decided on a personal 12\" pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and kalmata olives.  I waited about 20 minutes until the food arrived, which isn't bad for lunch. Yumm the smell of the pizza was divine! My first bite overtook my senses. Explosions of flavor all around my mouth, crunchy, gooey, saucy, melty goodness!! I quickly ate about 6 pieces in no time flat. I decided to take a breather before I was knocked into a pizza coma. As I was paying for my check, the two gentleman sitting next to me at the bar asked if they could have my 2 left over slices while they waited for their order......yes people the pizza is that good that strangers will ask for your leftovers!!\n\nI have become a believer! Grimaldi's is hands down the best pizza I have ever had! This says a lot because I spent 6 months in Italy and thought nothing in the US would be able to compare, but I was wrong. Grimaldi's is the shizzz!
