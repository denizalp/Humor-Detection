Flew into Pearson the other day with a tad of delays due to a red alert preventing our aircraft from parking along with the lack of available gates to receive our aircraft. \n\nCustoms and immigration was a seamless and easy process via automated kiosks. \n\nLocal ATMs were available to dispense local currency albeit with a $3 surcharge. \n\nSignage to the rental terminal was almost non existent which was troublesome at best... The steps to the process at the rental counter is rather dated too...\n\nOther than that, the terminal was in good shape, modern and up to date.
