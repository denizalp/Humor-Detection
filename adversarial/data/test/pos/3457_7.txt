I went to Nails 3 to get an eyebrow waxing, and I was very disappointed in the service. The woman who did my eyebrows had food sitting next to the waxing station. I would have preferred to wait while she finished her lunch than to look at it sitting out around the area that should have been sterile.\n\nAlso, she took a phone call while she was working on my eyebrows. She was canceling her Old Navy credit card, and she didn't have her social security number right. She was arguing with the Old Navy associate on the phone while she was dumping hot wax in the region of my eyeballs. It was pretty weird.\n\nFortunately, my eyebrows came out ok. The salon seems nice with lots of pedicure chairs and bright, colorful space...I won't be back to see if it was just a fluke, though.
