My roomie and I picked up some food to go a week or so ago. Loving Hut was open on Sundays so we decided to give it a try. Ugh! So gross! How does a place like this make vegan food so unhealthy?! Every item was just drenched in oil and fried... I could have gotten food like this from Panda Express or worse. \nWe ordered the sweet and sour \"chicken\", pad thai, and spring rolls based off of Yelp recommendations. They completely forgot our rice (even though they asked us white or brown on the phone) for the sweet and sour \"chicken\" so it was basically fried balls of batter in an overly sweet orange sauce. The pad thai had formed itself into one giant ball of noodles and yet still was drenched in oil. The spring rolls were so greasy they left oil on your lips. We actually both got SICK from the food here. We threw away the rest of the leftovers and vowed to never go back....\n\nIf you are looking to try great vegan food, try Green New American Vegetarian. Loving Hut is definitely not a good representation of how tasty vegetarian food can be. Don't waste your money!
