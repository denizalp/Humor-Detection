This was my first time here. Got the steamed snow crab pot with fries and hush puppies. The food was really good. Plenty of crab legs, and the fries were pretty good. The hush puppies had really good flavor. It just seemed like so much work to enjoy a meal. Everyone was so busy cracking crab legs that there was not much conversation.  \n\nThey give you bibs to wear, which is good. However, I was not really pleased with the 'funny' sayings the waitress wrote on them. My father-in-law had one that was cute, it said 'Love me some crab'. My husband was given one that read 'My waitress gave me crabs', and mine said 'I came for a good time, and all I got were crabs'. Maybe if I had been in a party state of mind, or with a big group of friends I would have found this a bit funnier than I did. \n\nThe stars are for the food. The waitress was very nice, but a bit overwhelming at times. Her heavy perfume was kind of unexpected at a restaurant. \n\nWe sat in a booth, and for some reason my husband and I were really uncomfortable. Both of us had really stiff muscles part way through our meal. It was if the springs inside of the seats were all busted. \nIf I was to return, I would have to try something completely different. I saw someone get a plate of nachos. Not sure what was on them, but they looked good.
