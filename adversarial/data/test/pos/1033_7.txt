How can I possibly give an establishment one star if  I have never eaten there, or even been inside?  I will tell you!  \n\nWe spotted this restaurant while driving around and tried to make a mental note of where it was located because we frequent Harvest Cafe and wanted a back-up if it was good.  Unfortunately we never found this place again until last week.  Eureka!  We decided to go and check it out as soon as possible so I called them and the lady who answered the phone said they were open until 3 p.m.  3 p.m.?  Who can make a living only being open from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.  Isn't this Vegas?  You know 24\/7 or at least 8 p.m.\n\nWhen we arrived there was one car in the parking lot just leaving...ut oh...the place is empty!  All the signs in the windows say they close at 2 p.m!  2 p.m.?  You've got to be kidding!  We missed it by 5 minutes?  And, who spells  \"country cafe\"  with K's?  You cannot possibly find this place with any app or yellow page looking for \"cafes\" - I know as I searched for weeks!\n\nSo make a note it's open from 7-2.  Guess it's good for breakfast and lunch, but not for dinner.  I sure wish they were, because if they are good we certainly could use another cafe around here.
