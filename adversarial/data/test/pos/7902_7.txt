Rather thoughtful place. I don't say that often about restaurants, but aside from the robot gimmicks, there are little things that make this place stand out.\n\nPros: First, the price is very reasonable for lunch: $20 adult, weekday. But more importantly, the portions are suitably small for AYCE so it's not like they are trying to rip you off. The udon soups, sushi pizza.. etc has all shrunk down to truly sample size so you're not filling yourself with carbs. This might not continue as the restaurant is new and they might be gathering good will, but it's still unique attention to detail that deserves praise. Second, the use of robots is just right in my opinion. They came around all cute like at regular intervals for dishes that made sense, (i.e. things that don't spill). I can only see this getting better from here. Non AYCE has an RGB light up ornament that comes with the dish, as well so you still feel special. Servers were attentive and kept our drinks full as well.\n\nCons: human-like sex doll greeting robots at the front were just freaky and need to be replaced with the cute rolling ones ASAP. Also, volume on the rolling robots really need to be turned up; I could not hear anything they said. Food itself was a little mediocre, not the best but definitely not the worst. Stand out dishes were the chicken skewers and Vegas roll. Instructions to pat the robot on the \"head\" after you pick up your food needs to be communicated more clearly. Note I came when it was medium busy and had a good experience, but I can easily see the experience diminished if the robots and servers are overwhelmed during busy hours.\n\nConsidering the price, and the fun factor, $20 was a good value overall.
