Since my last review, Western Honda did TRY to make it right.  They picked up my scooter and had it for a week.  They said the oil leak was \"residual\" and that they'd done something to address the overheating.  They were not successful, and my scooter continues to overheat.  I was going to try to take it to the shop recently, and it sounded funny, so I decided not to risk it.  Jason did say that when I next bring it in, he's going to call Honda and ask their advice.  He indicated there are no recalls or service bulletins regarding the ongoing problem of overheating for my Metropolitan.  Meanwhile, bike commuting continues, I've lost 20 lbs., and feel fantastic.  There's the up side!
