Received a flyer on our apartment door for Geno's Pizza & Cheesesteaks. We wanted to order a large spinach & meatball pizza with bread sticks and a 2 litre only to find out that they do not deliver to our address less than 3.5 miles from their location. \n\nI wish I could review the food (it looks good!) but will never go to this establishment. As a business, if you're going to pay a person\/service to plaster an apartment complex with your flyers that say you deliver, you better damned well deliver.
