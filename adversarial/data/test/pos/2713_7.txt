This review is based on Happy Hour at The Fish House where their appetitizers are on specials.\n\nThe wait staffs here are awesome: attentive, friendly and professional. We had great services while sitting at the bar area.\n\nFood wise was kind of meh, if I would had pay full prices for them, The Fish House would be a 2 star.\n\nOrdered:\n\nCrab Cakes ($6.99)\nMussels ($5.99)\nEscargot ($3.99)\nScallops Wrapped in Bacon ($5.99)\nGrouper Fingers ($4.49)\n\nNothing wow me enough to be excited and want to come back for more....\n\nMay come back for Happy Hour for a drink and snack, but definitely not coming and pay full prices for those!!
