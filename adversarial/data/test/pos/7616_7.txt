I thought this place was the shit but after a few months I was dying to find another shop. The cuts are inconsistent, Alex is full of shit (I was told that I could get a cut anytime, even after hours and he would hook it up but when I actually had to take him up on this offer he refused), you're stuck listening to Russian the whole time and it gets very hot in his shop. \n\nIt's not worth it because your cut will be great or it will suck. You are MUCH better off going to Najib's down the road. I had written my original review for this place after the first visit... Lesson learned.
