My New Favorite! !! !!!  \n\nI've been looking forward to it since I found out it was owned by the Kabob Grille Brothers.  Levant has a fantastic look!  If you can see, look at my photos of the interior of this place.  Though I have never been off this continent I imagine this is a Turkish decor!?  Beautiful!  The Black Napkins (or Dark Yellow) are a nice touch and great for those of us fond of black clothing and not fond of white lint from white napkins!\n\nMy dinner was a Kabob platter with Mihammara (kind of like hummus except made with ground walnuts, toasted pita bread, olive oil and spices), Tabbouleh, Pickled Vegetables, and a side of Potato Harra!  Everything had a a GREAT Flavor! The Beef Kabobs were not as tender as I was expecting, though still had great flavor! The Food was Beautiful!  Great Presentation!  Very colorful!\n\nFor Dessert I had: a Triple Chocolate Bombe I think it was called Profiteroles (I'm betting Italian!?) it was something like Almond? Ice Cream surrounded by Chocolate Ice Cream, covered in a Chocolate shell, topped with Chocolate Powder and Chocolate syrup and Whipped cream.  I threw the Whipped Cream into my Turkish Coffee though I do NOT recommend doing that!  Turkish Coffee only needs Sugar and maybe a cookie!\n\nThe music was Fantastic, sounded like Turkish dance club music and some mellow tunes from the Mediterranean!\n\nThe restaurant is down Levine Avenue of the Arts (probably not on your GPS - I'm guessing, so let me know if it is) between the Mint Museum and the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art and right across the street from the Knight Theater. Without mentioning it is right beside that \"celeb chefs\" place.  Second entrance (it looked like one) in the Alley between the Mint Museum and the Duke Energy Building!
