I'm updating my review with an awesome story and question.\n\nI last visited Revolver in May during my First Friday wanderings.  I found myself a cool old Prince 12\" and didn't think too much about it, until I put it on.  Sweet jeebus this was dirty - I swear that someone was actually having sex in the background.  It made Controversy sound like Pat Boone and it was AWESOME.  I am so thankful that I stumbled across this rare gem in amongst the stacks of musty vinyl at Revolver.\n\nSo now I ask you, where else but in the crates can you find that kind of experience?  It's certainly not found in the iTunes store.  Support the cool local record stores kids, before they're all gone and the government forces us all to listen to Justin Bieber.
