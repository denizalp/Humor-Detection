I read that St. Francis had changed hands.  I didn't think twice about it when we decided to eat here this evening.  A mistake.  A few months ago we were given a Local First \"Devour Phoenix\" gift card from friends.  It's valid at a handful of locally owned Phoenix restaurants including St. Francis...according to the website that accompanies the gift card.\n\nI arrived at Wednesday at 6:30 pm and couldn't help but feel that the restaurant was slow.  I sat at the bar and waited for my husband to arrive.  He walked in at 6:45 and we decided to stay at the bar.  It's warm and welcoming!  \n\nBefore we ordered we presented the bartender with our gift card. \"Does St. Francis would honor this card because from past experience we know that just because a website lists a restaurant as a participant it doesn't mean that you can actually redeem the gift card there?\"  The bartender assured us that they would accept it.  We responded with gratitude adding that the \"worst case scenario\" would be for us to have ordered and then either have to argue with restaurant staff to redeem the card or pay the full value of the check ourselves.  The former really ruins an evening out...and she agreed.  We smiled at each other.  All was good. \n\nWith our gift card validated, we each ordered wine; my husband had a delicious Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.  I asked to sample the  Zinfandel and one of their Pinots.  I know the difference between a fresh bottle and one that's been open too long and it was clear that both of my samples had reached their shelf lives.  The bartender assured me that they were open that morning.  I believed her.  Shame on me for going with the Zinfandel which I knew didn't taste right.\n\nWe then had the goat cheese which was as I remembered served with a variety of breads.  It arrived quickly and was hot and delicious.\n\nThen came time to order dinner.  No specials on a Wednesday night so we proceeded to order off the main menu.  We had some questions, and they weren't exactly esoteric.  For example, was it possible to add a side of salmon to the roasted vegetables?  How was the chicken prepared?    The bartender had no idea. \n\nAfter ample confusion over adding salmon to the roasted vegetables, we opted to make things simple and order the shrimp and avocado salad with salmon on top.  I had the filet.  Order in, wine flowing, we're ready for a great evening!  I finished my glass and had a glass of the Truchard Pinot Noir.  She opened a fresh bottle and it was perfect!  \n\nThen we talked and enjoyed.  But soon we asked \"is it taking a long time for our food?\"  The bartender mentioned that they had a private party upstairs...but it seemed quiet.  We were the only ones at the bar and the tables downstairs were half full...but we're not in the restaurant business, so what do we know?  \n\nFinally someone comes out of the kitchen.  She's carrying a salad with salmon on top.  Ours?!  She says to bartender in a voice loud enough for us to hear \"There's no more salmon.  Tell the guys at the bar there's no more salmon.\"  She then takes the last salmon to a table in the dining room.  :(\n\nThe bartender tells us what we already know:  they're out of salmon.  OK, no problem.  Instead we opt for extra shrimp. :) New order in!  We wait but eventually we start to ask \"is this taking a long time?\" \n\nFinally the meal arrives.  The filet was perfectly cooked, hot and delicious.  Great mashed potatoes!  The shrimp salad left a little to be desired.  It was small.  And the extra shrimp?  I couldn't find them.  All the shrimp were cut in half lengthwise.  Is that a thing?  It seemed like they were being cheap.  \n\nWe finish and ask for the check.  Wrong amount.  We get a new check. I present the gift card.  CHAOS ENSUES!  The bartender can't figure out how to redeem it.  The waitress can't figure it out either.  They devise a plan.  They hit all the buttons.  My husband is tired and goes home.  I wait.  I wait some more.  When finally I think we've arrived at a solution the bartender tells me that the owner won't accept her solution.  He'll be at the restaurant in 5 to solve this.  I wait 15 and finally the owner arrives.  He introduces himself as asks for time to figure this out.  I wait 15 more.  He reemerges and explains that he's a new owner and doesn't know what this gift card is.  WORST CASE SCENARIO.  \n\nTo his credit, he eventually accepts the gift card charging me a dollar more than I owe but giving me an extra dollar back in cash?  \n\nHe wants my honest assessment.  I tell him I'm not angry but that the restaurant business is competitive and he's got to figure out the small stuff to survive.  He offers a gift card.  I decline.  I didn't want to come back. :(\n\nForget the delicious filet and appetizer or cool bar, what will we remember about tonight? Old wine, no salmon, slow service, poor service and inability to accept your own gift card.  For an established restaurant, even with new owners, this is tragic.  Pray for St. Francis.
