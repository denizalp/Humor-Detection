Forget the cupcakes! These muffins are soooo much better. Here's a lil bit of history I gathered. The Muffin Girl, Taryn, started out in her own kitchen. One day the gal pulled out her bakebook in hopes of finding a yummy treat for a wedding shower she was prepping for. She tried 1,2,3 different recipes. None of them satisfying her taste buds so the girl ventured out and started to experiment, and voil√° The Muffin Girls' bomb muffins were born! Months later she opens up her own lil shop in Mesa, AZ. \nOpening day I'm there. I tried the peanut butter chocolate chip muffin. Served to me warm, with a fork, napkin, and in a cup, smart move! I was surprised by how heavy the baked goodie felt in my hand. I knew then it was going to be ooey goodness. It did not disappoint! It was super moist and the chocolate chips were melted to perfection. It was so filling I was only able to eat half. Thank goodness for the cup and lid because I was able to save and eat later for after dinner dessert. The plan was for me to share with my son, but well uh that didn't happen. He's just gonna have to get his own. \nSo needless to say, I will be back! Next time I will pick up a few more to share with friends and family (that's the plan, not a promise) if I can refrain myself from indulging. \nThey sell individually or by the dozen. Hot, warm, room temp and\/or even frozen! They are just starting up so no hot coffee yet, but it will be coming. Cold drinks offered as of now. Super excited to see this lil bakery grow. Super not excited about my running miles having to grow too. ;)
