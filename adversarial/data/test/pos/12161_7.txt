Loved the pizza! Was skeptical, but gave it a try. The slices are HUGE!. I had plain cheese, just wasn't in the mood for anything more. My friend had two pieces - vegetarian and a meat pizza. They have a walk-up window on the street, a counter where you can order a slice and sit inside and eat it (this is what we did) and they have a restaurant where you can sit. The service was great and so was the pizza. If you like a dry pizza (no oil) then this might not be for you, b\nut it was the awesome crust and the olive oil that did it for me. Every once in a while - WTF! Screw the Calories! -  just eat a great slice of pizza. I was glad I did. \n\nNote: it is an easy one block walk from the walking mall area in old town Las Vegas. \n\n8\/31\/14
