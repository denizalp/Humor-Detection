Everyone kept telling me how classy this place was and I beg to differ. First of all, when you walk in, there is a line of attractive women (thanks to the inch of paint on their faces) and the tightest scantly clad outfits I've ever seen. It resembles a brothel in a facade of a restaurant. They all smiled like debutants as if they were saying Pick Me! To be fair, the food was really good but the lighting was AWFUL! It was so dark that you can't even read the menu's. They had the audacity to offer me a flashlight. Thats so classy huh? Its nothing you need to wear a dinner jacket to thats for sure. The ambience does not match the price you pay, but then again its in Scottsdale and I see class through a European lens, not a scottsdale one.
