So, it's a sandwich shop.  It has a whole weed theme to it. HA-HA, yeah I get it.\n\nThis place does have some pro's working in it's favor.  Biggest compliment to this place...  They have kool-aid.  On tap.  No shit.  Let me repeat that.  kool-aid.  On tap.  Got it?  I had to rub my eye's in amazement and reflect on the pure genius of who ever approved that decision.  I can only imagine opening up the tap and letting it pour all over myself, bathing in it's elegance and beauty.  I assume this would violate a health code, so I will turn away from such behavior.  \n\nSandwiches are decent, nothing to write home to mom about, but better than your typical chain sandwich joints for a comparable price.  Won't win any awards but hasn't made me throw up.  I read a few reviews of people whining about the bread being harder than it should.  It is toasted, you know \"Like the typical customer\" (and the employees)  FYI, that will make the bread stiffen up some.  An elementary example of cause and effect.    \n\nTakes a bit of time to get your food but it is even posted it takes a while to make a \"quality\" sandwich.  I disagree, but since they post it, the line has been drawn in the sand and their intentions are noted.  Fair enough.  If you don't want to wait, go somewhere else.\n\nThe annoying things about this place.  You order your sandwich in some sort of pot head size, joint, penner, or whatever the hell they are.  Being pretty ignorant about this terminology myself, I just order a \"medium\" sandwich and they are cool with that.  The staff seems like your typical grab bag of a pothead assortment.  All shapes and sizes are represented.  The traditional hippie, the dreadlocked bandanna wearing pissed at the world guy, the pot smoking girls with bloodshot eyes and the \"huh-huh\" laugh, and the scrawny young guy laughing and smiling at nothing amusing and\/or funny, like Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie \"What's eating Gilbert Grape\"  I can't tell if they are high or just don't give a shit.  All right then.  I'm not here to judge, just to eat.\n\nThere is also a huge novelty joint hanging up in the store as well.  Not a lot of thought behind that, huh?  A bunch of tacky, goofy ass pot decorations and annoying associated artifacts are also always represented.  I suppose if I smoked weed this would be like eating at a museum or something.\n\nThe tables always seem dirty but I think everyone is too high to give a shit.  Plus it is always been busy when I have been in there so I'll go ahead and give them a pass on this.  \n\nIn all fairness, if this place was terrible I'd never come back, but I will.  Seems like I still grab lunch here every 2-3 months or so.  I'll still keep coming back, even if I have to deal with the whole weed thing.  Goddamn hippies.
