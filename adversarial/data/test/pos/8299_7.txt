So you know about the different levels of the Chandelier and that each level has its own menu? Yes! If you are a light drinker like me, make sure to check out all three menus before committing yourself to a drink! The first level is great for people watching but go to the second level for a more intimate atmosphere! \n\nAnd if you like Thai desserts, try the Fit to be Thai drink on the second level. I could easily finish two of those. Or three.
