Terrible. Pizza undercooked, inedible and looked terrible, as were the bread bites. Delivery showed up over 30 minutes after the online tracker said he left (and 15 minutes after it said Mmmm your pizza is there and we hope you're enjoying it). I'm usually very understanding but I just couldn't. At least when I called they connected me to the manager who said he would send someone to pick up the food and would give me a refund. My next call was to Jake & Sons Pizza, which I should have called in the first place.
