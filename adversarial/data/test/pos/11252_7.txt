This place is an absolute joke.\n\nWith a million other casino options on the Strip DO NOT waste your time, energy and most importantly MONEY in this hole.\n\nSat down with my boyfriend and a friend at the electronic Roulette table.  The \"dealer\" came around to collect our buy-ins and went back to type them into her computer.  We played a couple rounds and another girl came to switch out the dealer.  It was ALL down hill from there.\n\nFirst she mistakenly added another person's buy in to our tab.  We were fine with this error and realized she needed to adjust it...but in order to do so she cancelled all of the bets we had made for that round... meaning we did not get any of the money that we had rightfully won.\n\nShe called for help 3 or 4 times in a matter of minutes because she had NO IDEA what she was doing and finally a floor manager named Vince\/Vincent came to her rescue.\n\nUnfortunately, he was worse than her.  He did not understand the situation and acted as though we were getting upset because she had made the mistake of adding more money.  NO we were actually upset because she had made multiple errors in a matter of minutes and had wrongfully canceled our bets when we would have won money.  He accused my boyfriend of cussing at him (which he did not), and tried to make the situation better by saying \"Well, everyone makes mistakes\".  Harrah's does not train their employees...if she was still learning the process she should have had a manager or someone who knew what they were doing by her side the entire time.\n\nSpoke to the manager who told us he would follow up with Vince but unfortunately, Vince's awful customer service, rude accusations, and poor staff training will mean that me and my friends will NEVER return to this establishment.  I advise that you avoid this place at all costs.
