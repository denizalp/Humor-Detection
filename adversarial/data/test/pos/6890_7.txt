Terrible food. And they wouldnt let us pay our own bills because they thought we are thieves trying to \"Dine and Dash\". \n\nWe demanded to talk to the cashier, and then the supervisor, and then the General Manager (some old white lady) who all said that we have to pay together instead of separately. \n\nWe are COLLEGE STUDENTS with part time jobs, we just came from a party for the Japanese Student Association of UNLV. Of course we can afford your shitty $6 pasta alfredos. Second, theft is not within our moral code as innocent students. Third, if you wanted us to leave TOGETHER then don't tell us to do this at 3 o' clock in the morning where we are all tired and want to go home. \n\nSome of us, have priorities like a job, or classes, and we just wanted to have a quick meal. \n\nStop making really bad food too. I made 3 bathroom trips within one and a half hour of being stuck here.  One of the waiters tried to stop me from going to the bathroom. I guess his grumpy ass thought I was trying to run for it. \n\nWe weren't being obnoxious, there are plenty of seats and dining tables around us, and WE ARE PAYING. Since all of us were getting pretty sick from the Alfredo Sauce, Pasta Sauce, Pizzas, and poorly made dishes, one by one we started to go up to the cashiers counter to pay for our own dishes and leave early, only to be turned away at the front door. \n\nI started noticing a pattern, only females that complained managed to pay and leave, and the rest of the dudes were only allowed to leave together. By that point, I started making a scene on the Host\/Cashier's Table for the restaurant, threatening to accuse them of being sexist and claiming that they are calling us thieves until they finally let me pay for my own bill. \n\nThe amount of bullshit that I had to go through to eat here was fucking insane. I have never been to a dining location where I, and my peers, are viewed as fraudsters in the back of the minds of the entire staff as we entered. We didn't come inside in hoodies and waving Glocks in the air. We wanted to fucking eat. \n\nThe staff wouldn't let us leave. They served us food that gave us the shits. And they tacked on undeserved gratuity on our bills.
