I don't like to give 1 Star however in this case it got at least 1 because it's new and it does have a glimmer of hope to get better.\n\nWe ordered 2 things. 6\" Cheeseteak with several toppings and a 9\" chickensteak with lettuce.\n\nWe got Cheesesteak with no toppings at all but cheese and a 6\" chickensteak without lettuce. When your 6' 2\" 250 pounds this is not even an appetizer.\n\nThe chickensteak was small pieces of shaved chicken, most likely cooked last night or very early this morning, that were soooo dry they looked like woodchips you might have in your flower beds.\n\nIt was horrible and after driving 30 minutes full of hope for a great Philly Cheesesteak, I felt like one of the guys on the bus leaving Las Vegas after they lost everything.\n\nSorry lee's, unfortunately you scared us off for life.
