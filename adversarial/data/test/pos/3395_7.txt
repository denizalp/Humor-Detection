So glad the planets\/stars\/other celestial bodies aligned and I was finally able to get to try this place out.  I was supposed to go play tennis, but the pouring rain said otherwise... and then what I thought was going to be a \"quiet night in\" turned into an amazing feast.\n\nFirstly, I want to commend the servers and staff of this place - I know it probably does take a lot of patience to deal with food noobs to this place.  Everyone was so friendly and had a ton of suggestions - especially since it was my group's first time there.  \n\nWhile we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we found a spot underneath the metal awning behind the bar which is probably my favorite spot since you have bar service right in front of you and can people watch into the rest of the entire restaurant.  People will be fighting me for this spot when it gets warmer and the weather becomes more predictable, but for now... I'll take a little rain since it drove people inside.  \n\nOur very nice bar server suggested to start with soju, but I was leaning toward the beer- she must have had training from Leonardo DiCaprio and \"inceptioned \" me since I decided to go soju anyway.  I forgot how good soju can be - they offer a ton of different flavors, but I went straight up.  Later a friend ordered the yogurt soju and it came with a smoking shaker....  later I deemed it unicorn tears since it was so good - I've also had a good base of regular soju so my talking filter was unhinged that evening.\n\nThe table became ready and everyone arrived so we decided to take the awning party to the table.  The menu has a lot of choices... it's a one page menu, but it can be intimidating.  The BEST part is that you can't go wrong with anything you order... and don't be shy to share!  We ended up trying things off of a complete stranger's table (we traded bites of items).  I love it when food brings people together.\n\nGot to try the pork belly, wings, brunswick stew, kimchi slaw (vinegar), soy deviled eggs, ramen mac & cheese, sweet potato swirl.  My taste buds and stomach were a pair of happy campers that evening.  \n\nOverall the place has a great location... I love the fact that they don't let people park on the street in front of the restaurant.  Lets you see the patio and also gives you an unobstructed view of uptown when you are in the patio itself.  The decor is super inviting and comfortable, just like the people working really hard to make sure you have a great experience here.  Great place - I'll definitely be back since I'm within walking distance (a bit dangerous - I can hear the soju bottles trembling behind the bar already.
