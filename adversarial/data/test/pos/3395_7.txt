Plus side - huge beer selection( they let you sample which is nice), awesome dog friendly patio, people watching is phenomenal, pretty extensive food menu, nice vibe - not too loud or sporty - all ages, genders and persuasions. Service is quick, unobtrusive and low key. \n\nNegatives - too many beards. Employees are all guys in hipster street clothes, so any random bro in an American eagle t-shirt, faded flannel and two day old stubble can pose as your server.  Sort of odd.\n\nI'll be back for sure.
