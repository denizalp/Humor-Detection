Well I picked up my shotgun earlier today and guess what I am spending my time doing tonight.... Yup, cleaning my shotgun. That's right- I picked up my gun from having it cleaned and I'm cleaning it again. \nExtremely disappointed. Dropped my shotgun off to have it cleaned because it got dropped in the dirt and the dirt got pretty deep inside the chamber. The one guy in the front with braces on his lower teeth is a complete ass hole and I was debating not even leaving my gun there until some other guy walked out of the back and started a conversation with me- he ended up being a pretty cool guy and super good with customers. They said it would be ready in 1 week.... Well 3.5 weeks go by and still haven't heard a single thing from them so I go in there and sure enough my gun is ready and has just been sitting there. I explained that I didn't get any calls and the guy with braces simply says hmmm that's strange I don't know what to tell you, we normally call everyone on Friday. Ok good for you well you didn't call me! I get back home and start inspecting my gun and it has oil and finger prints alllll over it along with some type of reddish brown powder. Yup this is my first negative review ever on here and I will not be returning to Wright Armory. But to the guy in the back- awesome customer service. And to guy with braces- you will get no where in life with that kind of customer service.
