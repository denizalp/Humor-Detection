As I walked through Northlake Mall I was captivated by the sweet aroma of the delightful fragrances that illuminated from the store.  \n\nAs I drew closer I saw the sale signs throughout the store and on the signature items and I knew right there that it was a wrap! The next hour of my life was spent tickling the senses in my nose to find the perfect bath and body items to go home with me! Nothing that smelled like fruit or food, just clean, pure and bright fragrances!\n\nMy favorites are the Eucalyptus and spearmint stress relief (very relaxing at night), Eucalyptus & Tea and Hello Beautiful! \n\nPlenty of online specials (buy three get 3 free and buy 2 get 1 free)!
