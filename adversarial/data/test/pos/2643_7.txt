Was in Scottsdale on biz, had lunch here.\n\nStarted with the Creamy Artichoke & Jalapeno Dip, followed with the Warm Spinach Goat Cheese, and then the Asparagus Pizza. Finished with a slice of something, but can't remember what, probably cheesecake since it's what I always get when I eat out.\n\nFood was great, service was good, but I thought the prices was a tiny high. Maybe it's just Scottsdale...
