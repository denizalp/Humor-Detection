#888 review!\n\nToronto ... this is possibly the best true gelato in our city and you've been sleeping on this place.  This is the real deal gelato and made by owners who are passionate about it.  They even went to Bologna Italy to do the Gelato University (yeah... a real thing lol).\n\nSo I thought I went to all the best ice cream spots in Toronto and good god, did I get it wrong.  So Kekou, Put a Cone on It, Bar Ape, and Soma topped my list.. with some special mentions to other spots.  Somehow Futura opened last September on a quiet part of St. Clair and I was oblivious to it.  The only reason this place caught my eye walking down the street was the true authentic and only best way to store gelato... the metal lidded containers that you find only in the best spots in Italy.  I know Kekou and Soma have the same philosophy and care and it shows up in the flavours.  What drove me crazy was that there was a fake gelato shop down the block that had more people eating there cause their 'gelato' was all exposed in piles to entice you.  Guys!  The better stuff is just over there!!\n\nThis particular spot was opened by a couple who flew all the way over to Italy to learn the art of gelato.  They don't believe in artificial flavours or colours so you won't find crazy greens, blues, or red shades here.  Though the gelato maybe muted in shades... it BURSTS out in flavour.  I honestly think their flavours are better and stronger than Kekou and Soma.  Bold claim but I havent tasted a pistachio this good since my time in Italy.  \n\nThe store itself is minimalist, clean, and a bit rustic with the exposed brick walls and white washed surfaces.  There are a few spots to sit by the wall and on bar stools.  Generally it's take out but I feel the moment I step out the door with my scoop, I want to head back in and get more.  \n\nService here is warm, friendly, and genuine... they are happy seeing you fall in love with their flavours and gelato.  Just happy smiles all around.  How could you not want to cheer them on to be successful?  They did allow us to try a few different flavours but honestly, it was so hard to choose cause everything tasted amazing.\n\nBefore diving into the amazing flavours, I'll mention that they don't overfill the cups here but the price tag is so sooo reasonable.  I remember paying $7 for a medium cup at Soma.  Here it's $5.50 for about the same ... Mind you, it's not King West here but the value is much better.  You can get a small scoop starting at $4 and $6.5 for a large (and 3 flavours). \n\nPistachio - I was just surprised at this one.  Pistachio is more subtle and light in flavour compared to other nuts.  Though it is buttery, it tends to be lighter and more delicate.  When you first put a scoop in your mouth, the creaminess and light sweetness hits you first but ... wait for it.  As the ice cream melts and coats your tongue, the pistachio intensity hits you in a bold burst.  It's almost like eating a pistachio ganache.  Just ... incredible.  I also love how they didnt add any fake colour.  This gelato is a muted light tinged creamy green.  This is possibly one of the most creamiest gelato I've had in the city.  5+\/5\n\nPeanut Butter & Jelly - Another nut flavoured gelato and if possible, this is bolder than the pistachio.  This is just an wonderful roasted peanut flavour the first second you take eat this.  Lightly sweet with a jammy undertone, this is more delicious sweet PB over and over again.  Like the pistachio, it's super creamy and no fake colouring.  It's a simple beige colour but true to what a good peanut should look like.  If you love nuts, this and the pistachio would be your game changer ice cream in Toronto.  5\/5\n\nBourbon with Caramel Swirl - A rich smooth creamy base is the perfect background to the thick ripples of caramel in this gelato.  The caramel is a nice golden hue that looks like liquid glass drizzled through the light creamy gelato.  The flavour is a bit light on the bourbon and the caramel takes the centre stage ESPECIALLY when you get a big scoop of it.  It's a nice deep brown sugar note.  I would think the addition of the swirl keeps it above the regular caramel ice gelato and ice creams around the city.  4.5\/5\n\nEspresso - Bold and full bodied deep coffee notes is wonderful in this one.  You can see the darker brown specks of the coffee in this... unlike the Bang Bang, the coffee is so fine grind that it's just a super creamy texture while giving you the strong kick of coffee that you need.  It has a good balance of sweetness to the coffee.  Definitely my favourite coffee version in the city in 2018!  5\/5\n\nIn addition to great gelato, they have granita and sorbetto flavours.  Granita is different as it's fruit juices and water based so it's great for those who are lactose sensitive.  \n\nSo Futura has earned one of my few 5 stars ... Kekou and Put a Cone on it deserves my favourite Asian flavour spots but for true to Italian roots ice cream, this is my favourite in Toronto easily.
