WHAT TO TRY?!?\n\nThe taiyaki ice cream of course!! \n\nThey have a variety of ice cream flavors and toppings available so it's a mix match of what you want to create your very own taiyaki ice cream sundae! \n\nWhen I went, they ran out of some of the flavors though :( so be prepared that some of the ice cream flavors may not be there when you go. When I went they didn't have the matcha black sesame twist, the black sesame soft serve or the vanilla with custard twist. They only had mango, chocolate, vanilla or matcha flavor :(\n\nIt's really cool though. Even the fish itself has filling at the bottom - either red bean or custard! Yam yam! There's a variety of toppings to choose from from graham crumbs to mochi skewer to wafer stick to sprinkles to name a few. Then you also get to choose the drizzle you want on your ice cream. Can be chocolate, condensed milk, strawberry or caramel. Ice cream generally was the typical soft serve ice cream except for mango. It tasted more like a sorbet. \n\nIf you're not feeling ice cream, you can also order their slushie drink or matcha drinks. If you order the taro slush, you can opt to also get the unicorn floatie too for an additional cost. Really cute and the drink reminds me of bubble tea but in a slushie texture. The drinks in general were good too. \n\nMight I add, after buying the drinks, you can go take your Instagram worthy pictures on the Instagram walls set up in the back. Lots of opportunities to take good pictures of your drink, your taiyaki or you and your taiyaki! A wall that's filled with pink roses is on one side and a wall with different coloured lamps and spotlights is on the other side. Really cute shop to draw the millennials in!\n\nLAST TIP?! \n\nOn weekends this place gets packed, so come on a weeknight because it won't be as busy. I personally prefer the soft serve ice creams because of the creamy textures but don't be deterred away from the mango if you really love mango flavoured ice cream!
