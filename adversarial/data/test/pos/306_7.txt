This place calls itself \"The Coffee Shop\" but let me tell you, its far from being a coffee shop. We stopped in to order some coffee and what I got was something that taste like instant coffee. It was so weak I asked the waiter if I could get a fresh cup. He said it was fresh and that if I wanted something stronger I should order the expresso. I kindly agreed to the expresso and after a few minutes he came out with a cup. He was very nice and waited for me to taste it before he left. But in reality, even the expresso was very weak. It wasn't that dark color nor was it in a small expresso cup that you normally would get when ordering expresso. It was again weak, more like a tad bit stronger coffee and in a normal coffee cup size. So I kindly nodded a \"no\" with the waiter and he told me he'll be right back with a double shot. Once he returned with another coffee cup sized expresso, a little stronger than last but yet not expresso. I just kindly nodded a \"yes\" to him and we both smiled. But let me tell you, if you are thinking of going to \"The Coffee Shop\" for some coffee, don't be surprise that the coffee isn't up to par with it's title name. Also note that I have not tried the food so I can not express my opinions for that matter. So if you are in a dire need for good strong coffee go outside TI and look to your left you will see STARBUCKS.
