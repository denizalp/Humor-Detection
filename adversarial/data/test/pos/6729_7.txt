I'm all about cheap and delicious, but Pink's was cheap and downright bad.\n\nI've heard about them on TV so I chose their fame over the reviews (dumb move). The fact that their hotdogs look visually appealing made it much worse because the taste didn't match the looks. The hotdog and toppings tasted old and bland. Each bite I would question all the bad decisions I've made in my life. To add insult to injury, my friends and I all got stomach aches on the bus ride to EDC. Thanks Pink's Hotdogs, no one ever wants to take a dump in a Porta-potty at a music festival.\n\nPink's Hotdogs is a true definition of \"TOURIST TRAP\"!
