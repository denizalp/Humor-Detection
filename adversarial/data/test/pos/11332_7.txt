UPDATE: So I had some fast follow up from the hotline I called, and they said the line is always busy because they have that many people calling them. Granted, it is still a problem they need to solve (and stop making excuses for), but at least my complaint didn't go ignored. I added a star back for the response. \n\nI've been coming to this location for several years now, mostly because it is the closest location to my house. I've NEVER experienced rude or slow service per se, but there has been a little bit of attitude from two different people on multiple occasions (I try to not be too critical about this sort of thing in general, postal workers do not exactly get to interact with the nicest people in the world...).\n\nHowever my most recent experience there was really disappointing to me and how it was handled on follow up was even worse. As has been stated in other Yelp reviews of nearby post offices, the area is having a HUGE problem with their passport scheduling line. You call multiple times a day (in my case every day for 10 business days), and every time you get either sent directly to voicemail or the phone rings and rings and never goes to voicemail. You also cannot leave a message to be called back. I finally went in and asked to talk to a supervisor because it was impossible to get through and schedule an appointment. The supervisor said \"there is nothing I can do about it, our policy requires us to only take passport appts via phone, and you must have one in order to get a passport.\" Not exactly much help for a service they are required to provide...I asked for the contact information for the person who oversees his branch and he provided me with a generic USPS hotline number. I spoke with someone about my concerns who stated \"There is no such policy for any post office in the country. A post office is either allowed to accept passports or not, beyond that, any rules vary from location to location.\" It literally would have taken him two seconds to look at the schedule for that day and tell me when to return if there was an opening, but he refused to do so because of some policy he made up on the spot. Very frustrating experience.
