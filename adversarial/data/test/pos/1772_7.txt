\"White-washed Mexican food\"? Yeah, kind of. Your options are already pretty limited in Summerlin, but any place that unapologetically serves medium jarred Pace salsa with store bought chips ranks pretty low on my revisit list.\n\nLunch combos are cheap, menu has a lot of choices. Stuck to fairly safe options, including a chile relleno (I liked the sauce but pepper was soggy and had no spice) and chicken enchiladas (bland and unmemorable), rice and beans did not stand out. \n\nYou can do worse for Mexican food, but you can also do better... maybe getting a margarita makes their food more tolerable. If I come back, it'll be for HH.
