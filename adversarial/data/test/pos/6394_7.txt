My first visit to the SLS and this was for a free comped stay-cation night away for my birthday! Thank you to one of my sweet boy toys Joe for making this fun night happen!\n\nWow, we really experienced a lot of attention and great service from the staff. I  don't know if it was because we stayed on a Monday week night and the hotel and casino was dead? I am hoping the staff is always this Amazing and that the service is consistent and stays good years from now. \n\nIt was my birthday and they really spoiled me and kept the drinks flowing while I was playing cleopatra keno. I later stumbled up to the room, anyways lol. \n\nI enjoyed this small hotel and casino,  my room was beautiful and all we needed. My room was seductive and we all know I LOVE SEXY. A great spot to do a sexy photo shoot for sure! I really enjoyed my shower with the rain fall shower heads.  \n\nI will be back to enjoy another fun night stay for sure!. This is my new favorite find on the strip!\n\nI also enjoy that the SLS has one selected restaurant each Sunday that is 50% off for local diners.
