Frick. Years later and I'm still loving these sandwiches and bao\nThe fried chicken bao is sooooooo good.\nAnd the price hasn't even really gone up in this entire time they've been open- minimal inflation, still delicious product.\nI like how they don't do a basic cold cut so it's not like this place outshines regular 2$ viet banh mi places- it's just a really good supplement.\n\nI have to say though, they really need to get on cleaning the place more often- it gets filthy here. Tables are full of crumbs and food droppings, sauces, etc. even the seats are dirty sometimes. I get that when it's busy all staff are dedicated to the lineup. But perhaps provide some cleaning solution, wet wipes and large paper towel so people can clean up the tables themselves?\nI've also seen people liberally throw napkins and stuff on the ground and not care to pick it up. Like the girl beside me today cleaned the table with a napkin, but then just pushed all the food to the floor and then tossed the napkin on the ground too. Stop being filthy, people- that behaviour wouldn't even be acceptable in a foodcourt .
