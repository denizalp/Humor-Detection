My fam√≠lia would kill me for going to a restaurant like El C, but I can't knock Lakewood for being different and putting a personal twist on Mexican cuisine. I love Mexican food. It's flavorful, it's delicious, it accounts for most food groups in a bite, and it's comfort food me. \n\nAt El Carnicero, it's acceptable to eat just dip and guacamole as a meal. I really enjoyed the goat cheese guacamole and the sikil pak is fantastic! Definitely should order the sikil pak. Another solid choice is the red pepper margarita, but I think everyone is already aware of the amazing margaritas being served. I ordered the Al Pastor tamales for dinner. Thought it was good. Very flavorful, filling. Strangely tasted hints of coffee. Probably order a duck confit dish next time.\n\nIt's true... El C is pretty expensive, but oh well, sometimes you just gotta treat yo self.
