Round by round, el Canelo is the best Mariscos restaurant in Las vegas!\nWe started with the oyster shots, fresh oysters with tasty sauce and tequila, they definitely delivered their intended punch! We also had the marlin tacos quesadilla style and they were excellent! pure goodnes in a tortilla! They also serve mantaray tacos for those looking for something more on the exotic and out of the ordinary, and like 99.9% of all the other other exotic meats they don't taste like chicken. The seviche tostadas needs more fish\/shrimp and less cucumber salad but other than that they're delicious. \nPlace is small but comfortable and clean (with an A rating from the health department.) Theres a couple of TVs playing corrido videos adding to the classic marisqueria atmosphere and our waitress and manager\/(owner?) were very friendly and attentive they really made us feel like home.\nThe only little problem was that they couldn't serve beer yet, they had the beer and the permit is been approved but they hadn't recived the actual certificate but once they do I'll be paying them child support. There's nothing better than mariscos, beer and corridos. Can't wait to go back and try the Malverde ostiones that the manager recommended she said those and the seafood molcajetes were their most popular dishes.\nEl Canelo, nothing to do with the famous Mexican boxer ( I asked ) with more seafood variety and the freshest flavors than the competition, wins by a culinary knockout.
