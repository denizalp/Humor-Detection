The Cabaret at theatre square is part reminiscent of the supper club at the long gone Holiday house. I belong to the Cabaret series where they bring celebrities in on Mon nights at certain times throughout the year and they do a concert. The Cabaret series normally sells out so this year they added a 2nd performance. They usually have a meet and greet after the show. Celebrities I've seen perform include Billy Porter, Lea Salonga, Judy Kuhn and Kelli O'Hara. Next up is Cheyenne Jackson followed by Lucie Arnaz in Nov.\n\n Prior to the concert you can grab a meal of light bite with table service provided by Meat and Potatoes. Outside the theater is a bar area.\n\nDuring the week they will have a small scale stage production that will run for a few months. The set up is the same. I have seen a couple of comedies there which include \"Murder for two\" Currently playing is Xanadu. Following that will be \"Perfect wedding\". Prices are reasonable for the shows or you can buy the series.\n\nIt is a small and intimate theater. Most seats are tables that sit 4 but in the back are three straight rows where you can see head on.
