Davidson has beautiful 18th, 19th and current century homes of all architectural shapes and sizes. You feel a sense of pride in the residents who live here and pleasantries exchanged from neighbors and strangers alike, that make you smile and wave in a familial way, even in brief encounters.\n\nOn Main Street, you will find eateries\/restaurants, coffee, candy & ice cream shops, beer gardens, Supper clubs and more. All the cascading backdrop to the main attraction, which is the college of its name sake. Sprawling buildings of higher education, entertainment and housing encompass a large acreage of the town, with an impressive list of alumni and\/or attendees.\n\nThe town is centuries old however they have mixed modern infrastructure enhancements, a modicum of cultural inclusion with old school southern sensibilities to make this place interesting and pleasing for outsiders who love the small town charm.
