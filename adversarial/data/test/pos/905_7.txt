This authentic paleteria\/ice cream vendor shop is a HUGE deal and popular with the Latino community, celebrities and even Hillary Clinton! So popular the family business has grown to 7 locations, with now one here in Henderson! Corner of Whitney Ranch \/ Russell, it's been open since February 2016\n\nHere's a quick rundown\n\n-Both milk and water based ice creams, along with paletas (ice pops with real fruit), agua frescas are all scratch made.  All natural ingredients, none of the mixes or powder packs. Tried and true family recipes.\n\n-Popular: Gansitos (reminiscent of strawberry jelly roll snack cakes) \n-Personal Fave: Rose Petals (floral note is prominent) \n-Unique: Cheese ...yeah, cheese! Cheese and fruits Cheese and corn etc.\n-Healthy: Dragon Fruit (non dairy, naturally sweet)\n-Price: Pretty affordable. I dont think I spent more than $10 here yet.\n~Must try: everything!  Awesome and friendly staff encouraged me to sample everything. \n\nThe shop is well lit AND clean. Better record with SNHD than places over on Spring Mountain, just sayin.\n\nThe downside, space is small, only limited to have tables outside, but their shop is packed and stocked with all kinds of snacks and desserts popular in Mexico. Plenty of parking though! \n\nService is welcoming and friendly.  Even with a language barrier (mostly Spanish speaking), communication was not a problem.\n\nCan't believe that this place has been here almost a year and I missed it! Ahh! Adding both LA Flor De Michoacan Ice Cream shops to my list of local  and family run places to patronize. Especially for Dragon Fruit and Rose Petals ice cream!
