There is nothing special about this place that warrants a return visit. Our party of 6 was seated right on time for our 5:15 reservations. The restaurant was not busy this particular Sunday night, but reservations are recommended. We were quickly served hot bread and butter which was a good start because I was starving!  Our server was nice, but she was inconsistent. After she took our orders, we hardly saw her again. Someone else brought our dinner to the table, and we were all shocked that they didn't offer cheese. This is supposed to be an Italian place right?? We had to wait a while for our server to come back and check on us and then we were able to ask for fresh parmesan. After that, we hardly saw her again except when it came time to drop off the check. Even after that, she disappeared for a good 20 minutes and we needed some things on our bill adjusted so we finally had to flag someone down to ask them to tell our server to come back to the table. \n\nThe food, meh, nothing special and surely over priced. I went with the chicken under the brick, which is a grilled chicken breast with marsala mushroom sauce, served with mashed potatoes and veggies. The marsala sauce was really good, I just wish there were more of it. I loved the vegetables that came with my meal especially the carrots, they were a tad sweet so I think they might have been glazed. I also ordered a side chopped salad which was just okay as well. For each side salad it was $4.95! That is for lettuce, a few chopped veggies, and dressing. The bill for just me and my mom was $54! Other people in my party agreed the food was just okay and definitely overpriced. I hear they have a good happy hour, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying the happy hour.
