Just the loveliest brunch spot in Tremont! This hot neighborhood cafe is usually super busy (and for good reason), so plan your trip wisely! \n\nCame here for Sunday brunch and waited 40 minutes for a table, but it was SO worth it! Their brunch is obviously super popular, but they turn the tables pretty fast. They have a whole list of coffee\/tea drinks, so we ordered a few at the takeout counter and enjoyed them at the park across the street while we waited. My peach cooler (black tea, peach syrup and almond milk) was delicious and refreshing!\n\nLucky's is a small, charming cafe. They have a really nice covered patio that sits adjacent to their garden. The whole concept is farm-to-table so they include a lot of their garden veggies\/herbs in their dishes, but everything else they use is from local Ohio farms. We tried their biscuits, triple B salad, and one of their specials, the zucchini cakes. Everything was amazing! \n\n-The cheddar scallion biscuits were light and fluffy and topped with scrambled eggs and savory sausage gravy. --Everything you want in comfort food.\n\n-The triple B salad had amazingly fresh ingredients... sweet beets, strong blue cheese, and savory bacon (3 Bs) with romaine, grapes, candied almonds, and buttermilk dressing. --Such a delicious combination and really nice to have alongside heavier brunch dishes. We ordered the half portion and it was perfect to split between 3 people with 2 other dishes.\n\n-The zucchini cakes were topped with basil pesto ricotta, sunny side up eggs, and pico de gallo on the side. --Absolutely heavenly, and I think they run this as a special pretty often.\n\nPrices were amazing for the quality of food. Service was a little slow, but I think that's because our server has a 5-minute spiel about the restaurant that he was rattling off to every table (he was an actor so I mean props to him for remembering every line of his speech, but I think he needs to trim it down to a one-liner for the sake of everyone's time). \n\nOverall, Lucky's is going on my top places to brunch in CLE! I totally understand why it's been on shows like Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and Best Thing I Ever Ate. I will definitely be back next time I am in town!
