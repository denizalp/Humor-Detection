I just started at Naada recently so I'll likely update this review in a bit as I get to know it better but my first impressions are hugely positive. I love the expansive vibe as you enter and the sense that you are in a space that is not just a gym equivalent or a snob fest or a bunch of awkward bits of cultural appropriation woven into new age mindfulness cult. It's a place of joyful study, and community connection. Everyone I've interacted with who works there has the same vibe - helpful but not too serious. Real smiles and laughter in a quiet respectful way. I dig it. \n\nI've been trying out a class that happens in a pretty small room and it can definitely get crowded and warm, and I bet it's kind of nuts in there in the summer. But I like the spacious area for coats and changing cabins and bathrooms, and I appreciate all the clean and good quality gear they have for you to use, from mats to blocks, straps, pillows and cozy blankets. The teacher I've had is funny and thoughtful and really focused on each person finding their flow and connection to their bodies - the opposite of the weirdly competitive \"i'm more bendy than you and more zen than you!!\" vibe that I've seen manifest in other yoga scenes. \n\nNaada participates in local block parties and other community events in their neighbourhood and runs all kinds of creative classes tying yoga to voice and music. I look forward to getting more involved with this fun inspiring space!!
