To start off, I would like to mention that I am not endorsed by Aria Resort and Casino, nor have I been paid for this review by Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas. Also, I am not biased against Donald Trump, but I voted for Gary Johnson because as a Mormon who is unable to drink alcohol, marijuana is fully endorsed by the Church.\n\nAnyways, Thanksgiving week is a time that you should absolutely spend with family, so you can get free food, free booze, and free money, as long as you're not the one paying for it. In this case, I wasn't paying, so I happily said yes to a stay at the famous Trump International Hotel Las Vegas 2 bedroom penthouse strip view.\n\nThe family and I started off around 8am in the morning in the beautiful state of California in the gorgeous city of Los Angeles. We decided to swing by Death Valley because Death Valley is like Mecca for Mormons. After a long 10 hour drive from Los Angeles, to Death Valley, to Las Vegas, we finally arrived at Trump International around 8pm. At this point, I would like to mention that the Trump International valet's are bigots. Just because we arrived at the hotel in a cheap $30,000 Hyundai Sonata Limited, the valet's completely ignored us as we unloaded our luggage. It wasn't until we were finally trying to drag all our luggage inside that a valet came over and asked if needed any help. Note, there were only 2 other vehicles by the valet's. That's right, 2 much more expensive luxury vehicles. So from the start, I already had a bad vibe from the Trump International staff, staff who discriminate against the non-luxury driving group of people. \n\nAnyways, once we got into the room, I must say the foyer is fantastic, and the bedroom are fairly spacious. The bathroom was extremely extremely lacking though. The glass doors were so wobbly and parts weren't screwed in properly so every time the glass doors were opening and closing, it felt like it would fall apart. That said, the lack of a steam shower (which the Aria sky suites have and is amazing) really killed the showering mood. Also, all the pillows are too soft, I had to stack 5 pillows to even get close to the pillow I use at home. \n\nLong story short, if you're not visibly rich, staff will ignore you in the valet area. The pillows are weak. There's no casino so I have to utilize the free shuttle to Wynn or Caesar to play some slots and lose $100. Also, the restaurant downstairs won't seat you at a table unless you have a reservation so make a reservation.\n\n\nOverall, I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you to stay at Aria Sky Suites. You pay the same price for a similar 2br suite at Aria for 5 times the service (thanks Aria, you guys are the best) and they won't discriminate just because you have jeans on and not a 3 piece suit. Oh, did I mention Aria has a casino?\n\n1 star down for lack of casino\n1 star down for discrimination against the non-visibly wealthy\n1 star down for the lack of amenities
