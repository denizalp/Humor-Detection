This places serves pretty good Thai food, I dunno if it's the best as others claim it to be but to each their Thai own. \n\nVenue is pretty small, VERY busy during lunch hours, come by a bit past dinner time on a rainy day if you want the restaurant to be all yours. \n\nService is pretty quick, almost seems like they rush you (but that seems to be common in every Asian restaurant, lord knows why) \n\nThe menu is short and small, I personally think these types of restos are the best because the put all of there focus on 15 main dishes instead of 50 like other places and skip out on their wine if you can, not the best options, save your $$. \n\nFood tasted great, very filling with lots of fresh ingredients and flavours. We ordered only 2 mains and shared because portions are pretty big if you aren't that starved. \n\nDinner: \nPad Thai Sam Roas aka 3 Flavours Pad Thai ($15) which was rice noodles, tamarind, egg, tofu, bean sprout, fresh roasted peanuts, shallot, chive, dried chili, lime and long leaf cilantro. \nKhao Pad Gaeng Kaew Wan aka Green Curry Fried Rice w\/ Beef ($15) which was green curry, rice, bamboo shoot, green bell pepper, thai basil and fish sauce. \n\nThis place is a great dinner option, it's tasty food, big portions and won't hurt the wallet, get take out if you are on a date tho haha it's not the best dining experience, those awful seats :(
