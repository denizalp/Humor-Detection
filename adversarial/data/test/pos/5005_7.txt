Smokin' Ed has grown the world's hottest pepper, the Carolina Reaper for the past few years.  It was officially certified by Guinness in 2013 and reconfirmed in early 2014.  This is one hot pepper obviously.  I tried it at a Yelp event but will not be doing that again.\n\nThey make their own hot sauces in the store with a variety of peppers and also sell some other unique brands.  The staff is very friendly.  The prices on some of the sauces are somewhat high, but this is one thing where you get what you pay for.  If you're in Fort Mill and are a spicy food fanatic, stop into Puckerbutt.
