I was here for an attorney's conference in July. It has taken me this long to collect my thoughts to write this review as I have NEVER, and I mean NEVER, been treated so horribly at a club. \n\nThis club is in the hotel where a huge attorney's conference took place in July. My friends, (1 who was  an attorney and a speaker at the conference) and I decided to give this place a try. We played the usual wait-in-iine game as clubs do. Once in, we began to scope it out and noticed that there were no seats, no real dance floor (more like a dance space--a joke),  and all tables and booths were taken. Literally you had to stand; not even a seat at the bar or the rooftop. Ridiculous. \n\nWe three ladies were invited into a booth 3 different times by  3 different groups of men (all non-black) but the same RACIST white bouncer kicked us out of the groups each and every time. At no point were we asked if we wanted to get a booth. Instead we were kicked out and about repeatedly and rudely.\n\nFinally, I said to the bouncer as did my attorney friend, that he was treating us 3 black women differently than others, we noticed...he hadn't asked us if we wanted a booth, bottle service, or even to allow us to sit with a group when invited...for all he knew this group was one we intended to meet up with at the club. That said, he became quick to deny that he was being racist but we pointed out that many other females (non-black) werent being followed  or harassed like we were. We could have enjoyed the night a little but literally even if we stood in one place too long we were told we were in the way and had to move.... to that I say, make a bona fide dance floor for folks to commune with the music and one another instead of a club laced with booths and tables that must be reserved for $150 with bottle service.\n\nI hate to write such a negative review especially about a racist type of treatment but this was so over the top that my attorney friend and I actually discussed suing the club for the distinct racist treatment. WE WILL NEVER RETURN. I suggest you consider your own attendance carefully.
