Awesome breakfast and lunch spot in a more commercial area of Vegas. There's a decent sized sign off of the main road here as the front of the restaurant faces the parking lot and its shared but there are plenty of spots.\nBoth times I was there, it was busy but we got a table right away. There is counter seating too where you can watch the food came out of the kitchen. There are booths and tables as well. Hostess greets you on the way in and gets you seated. Very nice and accomodating here. Waitresses got to us right away for drinks. The menus are unique here. They are set up like a newspaper. Pretty cool idea. I've only gotten breakfast here but they have soups and sandwiches as well. The lastest you can get a table is 3 pm, so its a breakfast and lunch spot only. \nThe food is delicious and the portions are huge. Ive gotten the muffin with my breakfast both times and that tastes great. Its warmed up as well. Corned Beef Hash is good here. Not sure if its homemade or not but it was good. The \"diablo\" style home fries as well. \nI'll be back soon hopefully.
