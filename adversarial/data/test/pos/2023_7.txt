This place is very busy on a weekday, so I waited for my lunch about 25 minutes. It's a very small place so if you want to have a sit you have to get there early. Tonkotsu ramen was pretty good bat a little salty. Actually not the best I've ever had. However it does have great flavors. But Pork belly rice bowl was really good. The service is quick enough. Though I am not a fan of Japanese food, I like this place...
