If you are intelligent enough to check reviews first before coming into the dull waste of money that is Koi nightclub, please stay away. It's always dead in there.\n\nIntrigued by the line outside? They do that on purpose to make it seem like its a happening in there. It's not. It's a bunch of dudes hitting on fat girls simply because the girls are drunk and the dudes already paid $20.00. Nowadays thanks to some comps due to my frequent stays in Vegas I get to go in there for free if I want to. But the fact is you can't PAY me to go in there.\n\nYou have better options in Vegas people.
