Whenever I travel, I try to stay at grand old pre-Depression era hotels.  Pittsburgh is perhaps the king of shrinking, pre-Depression American cities, and there's an argument to be made that the Penn Hotel is thus, perhaps, the king of all such hotels.  Part of being in the running for that title usually means that the rooms tend towards being musty, small and outdated.  The Penn generally isn't though, having had the benefit of a serious, recent renovation.  The room I stayed in on my last trip to Pitt was 500+ sq. ft. (see pic), and I didn't do anything douchier than claim I was two people when I was really only one to get it.  The service matches the veneer; I swear to God, everyone I dealt with @ check-in had an Old World accent and seemed like they had a bona fide paraphilia for the Ask Jeeves shtick. \n \nOne thing I learned on my most recent trip was that if you pack your shirts, suits, etc., in individual garment bags, all within a larger garment carrier, they will barely wrinkle, if at all.  An even better thing I learned was that if you sign up for Omni's Select Guest club (which costs nothing but a disposable email address), they will iron your shit for you 24 hours a day, for free, as well as provide you with free morning drinks, newspapers and whatnot, free wi-fi, etc., *for life,* so that's totally worth doing if you plan on staying here.  If you're staying at a place like this in a post-Depression city like Pittsburgh, you're probably doing it one someone else's dime.  So make sure you tip everyone you come in contact with like you're Andrew Carnegie, the staff here deserve it.
