No animals were harmed in the making of this review.\n\nEver thought about going vegan for the animals \/ the environment but you didn't want to miss out on all the filthy bar food so you decided to become a \"flexitarian\"? Or maybe you switched to humane, free range, (insert feel-good buzzwords)? Well you surely need to check this place out!\n\nThis is a 100% vegan bar, mainly serving bar foods prepared with meat & cheese substitutes with the taste and the texture of the real deal. If you are expecting a grass juice or a kale salad in here then you are going to be extremely disappointed.\n\nI asked for the chicken & waffles but they were out of those, sad! The waitress recommended the vegan version of the Big Mac. Portions were Huge, something rarely seen in vegan restaurants. Burger is filthy in a very good way and you will need napkins.\n\nUpdate: I finally tried their chicken & waffles. They are amazing! tastes better than the Big Mac if you ask me. I absolutely recommend it. Oh and don't upgrade to \"fun fries\", not worth it if you ask me.\n\nIn case their tasty food didn't convince you to go vegan, there are plenty of vegansidekick.com comics on the walls that should do the trick.\n\nThis place is 30 min drive from my home. Totally worth it. I hope more vegan bars like this one open all around Toronto and GTA.
