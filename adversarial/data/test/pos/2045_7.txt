I'd rank this even lower than the airport Starbucks. The prices are higher. The staff doesn't seem to know what they are doing. And the lines can get mangled and disorderly. But if you don't order anything fancy, your overpriced coffee drink should turn out just fine. But if you really want to get a good Starbucks drink, you should go to another location.
