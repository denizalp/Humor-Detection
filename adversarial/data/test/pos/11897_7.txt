I grew up going to this pizza shop. I used to ride my bike there as a kid and fold pizza boxes for free slices of pizza and worked there for 7 years throughout high school and college. Of course I may have a little bias but you can not find a better pizza shop for many many miles nearby and truthfully you may not. The dough is the some of the best I've ever had, the sauce is great and the smoky provolone cheese tops off the perfect pizza they make. I live in the Tampa Florida area now and you can not even find a pizza shop that comes close to the quality of pizza they have here. There's something about the overall ingredients that separate them from the competition. The hoagies and calzones are also amazing. Try dipping any of your crust in your Coke or Dr Pepper (Definitely weird I know.... But delicious)! Even more-so when they used to have crushed ice.
