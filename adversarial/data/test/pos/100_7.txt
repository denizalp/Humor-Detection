When I first arrived to this place I was a little skeptical due to the fact that you have to park in the dirt! But there were a ton of cars so I knew it was going to be a fun place.\n\nWhen I walked in there were so many things going on. If you make a right you will be in the outside patio where they have a bar and places to sit. There were beer pong games being played. There were people eating. As you continue to the back of the bar there is another bar with so many beers on tap it will make your head spin. I am unfortunatly not a beer drinker. And to the right of the bar there is a small bowling alley! I never played in there but it looked like a lot of fun.\n\nThe food is pretty alight. Its regular bar food you usually find. I had the taste of the wings, fries, onion rings. It was pretty good.\n\nThe bartenders were pretty fast and do their best to not ignore anyone when your at the bar even though this place gets REALLY packed during a weekend. Even on a Thursday night it was really full.\n\nThis place is a great place to hang out with friends. It is on the Southwest area which is not the side of town where regular hip bars are found usually its closer to downtown but I would travel over there to hang out again.
