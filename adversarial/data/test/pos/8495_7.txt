Do yourself a favor when this flyer comes in the mail and throw it away. Slimy sales guy comes to your house, \"forgets\" to add windows and tells you they are on the invoice, incorrectly measures windows, and then goes MIA when you call to ask clarifying questions. \n\nEnter installation guy who makes a HUGE mess while installing, \"forgets\" to tell you he took off a door handle and then leaves it for you to discover while he shrugs when you ask if he is going to put it back on--he doesn't, and finally has to take main set of shutters back because they are missing supports.(And damages your new tile by dropping his tools on it.) \n\nNow down two shutters, completely bare windows, and not sure I will see anyone again. Demanded payment before job was done, so I gave them a check and stopped payment on it a day later when I realized they probably were not coming back without some incentive. Waiting for a nasty phone call for payment any day now. \n\nWhat a shoddy operation. Stay away.
