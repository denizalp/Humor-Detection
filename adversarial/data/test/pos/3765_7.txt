To quote the late-great Rick James; \"Holy smokes and Gee Whiz!!!\"\nWhy, for the love of all that is holy, have I not been here before today?!?  Just as I was about to give up hope for a dinah-mite breakfast joint, I read Nicole W.'s review and braved the storms to try one more spot.  And boy am I glad I did!\nWhen I entered, the man with the golden spatula started cursing my choice of head wear (a Red Sox visor).  At that moment, I knew I was in for a great experience!\nI sat down at the counter and started to go thru the menu for possible victims.  I decided on the Shepard omelet.  While waiting for the food, i read about Mattie's Diner, and it's Homer-esque journey to Charlotte.  When the omelet arrived, it was as if the heavens opened and I heard the voice of my maker say, \"You're welcome!\"  OMG was it awesome.  No, it was beyond awesome, it was WICKED awesome!  The ingredients were fresh, the portion was plentiful, and the taste....oh the taste!  During the meal, I had a chance to talk to the owner\/cook and the ladies that work there.  I had a great conversation about old school diners, and the lost art of breakfast.\nOverall, GREAT food, GREAT selection, GREAT atmosphere, GREAT people!  The price for the meal was more than reasonable, and well worth every penny!  \nIt took me six months of living and searching in Charlotte for the best breakfast joint.  If you only have time to have ONE breakfast in Charlotte, I highly recommend Mattie's.  They truly are \"dinah-mite!\"  I'll be going back to try everything on the menu...and my eye is on the Hunka Hunka Burnin' Toast!\nNoosh!
