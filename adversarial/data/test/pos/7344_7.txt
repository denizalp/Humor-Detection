I have taken my ride here a few times for service issues, and every time the issues were resolved beyond my satisfaction. The mechanics know their stuff, and the other staff, as well as the owners, are warm and friendly. \nTo be honest, I am happier with the service and experience here than at any other auto repair establishment, ever. \nI will certainly be back. I hope EMC stays in business for a long time.
