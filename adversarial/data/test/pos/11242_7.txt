This was the second time I've been to this location and I was very content with my trip. The wait for my friend and I was less than 5 minutes (on a Friday night at 7PM PST). We both started out with drinks and the chicken lettuce wrap appetizers. When I tell y'all I ALWAYS get this appetizer, I'm not kidding. It's something light, tangy, crunchy and something I look forward to ordering when I come here. For dinner, my friend and I both shared the Wild Mushroom Pizza. If you are a mushroom lover, this pizza is def for you. Thin crust, wonderful cheese ratio and the meatiness from the different mushrooms really make this pizza. We decided to get dessert and ordered the chocolate cake (sorry I can't remember the full name!!) with ice cream. It's really chocolaty, so if you don't mind that, this dessert is perfect for you
