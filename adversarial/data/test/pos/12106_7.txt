Two reasons the place gets 5 stars \n1- my daughter was born here \n2- the staff in the natal centre was amazing. \n\nBeyond that, you have to walk through the emerge to get to your ar from the natal wing when it's after hours and on a sat night\/early Sunday morning it's pretty wild to say the least. \n\nIn the natal wing they also ave a great lounge for new parents to relax watch tv and keep there lunches.. \n\nFunny story, due to the location of the hospital you get a lot of hipsters here and one early morning after my daughter was born I feel asleep watching \" best of pride fc \/ bloodiest UFC fights\". I woke up watching shogun rua stomping his opponent and some skinny pants hippy tried to change the channel.\n\nSorry buddy, not happening. Sit back, grow a sac and watch some head stomps!
