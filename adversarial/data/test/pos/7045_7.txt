Came here on a Monday night I was very excited to come here after reading the reviews of how awesome this spot was especially after discovering it was right down the street from Rhodes Ranch where we live...\n\nour first three rolls had already came out and had to wait to flag down our server to ask for saucers for our soysauce and the fresh wasabi that we ordered...while our baked roll was getting cold\n\nordered the udon which I'm guessing is microwaved since after our first udon the second one came out within less than 5 minutes from when we asked for another ..\n\nafter our premium sashimi platter finally came out I asked the server if our yellowtail collar is coming out soon she said that it should be done shortly she then went back to the kitchen  and reported back to us she had forgotten our collar, we still asked them to make it ..collar came out and it was not cooked, I had to get the attention of the hostess to ask for it to be cooked more, server came out and gave us the excuse that they cook all their collars medium but that she asked them to cook it throughly for us since we wanted it cooked all the way, but I had ordered it after I saw a picture on yelp which looked completely different then the one we got pale and pink inside..\n\nWe went to the restaurant expecting a lot more seeing that they boast that their chef is from Nobu but my opinion, just as it is important for the sushi to be good so does the whole experience...\n\nI then had to get the attention of the hostess who was standing by the register chatting it away with whom looked like the owner to ask for a box and our check..a total of 3 times till I got my check processed..that I had to say loudly \"excuse me\" to the hostess multiple times..\n\nNot to mention that the owner didn't even have the etiquette to come and apologize to us and walked right past our table..\n\nWasted 200 on a place with mediocre food,poor service, and lack of respect for their customers opinion..then hands us two free appetizer cards to us..won't be needing those...I will not be returning nor will I be recommending to anyone
