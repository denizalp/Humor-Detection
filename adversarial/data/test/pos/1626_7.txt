Finally! An upscale \/ non-college bar in Kent! \nMy friends and I started our night out here and left with a new best friend, our waitress Philese! She was absolutely amazing... so funny and kind. We just hit it off with her and then nervously asked her to be our real-life friend, haha. \nThey have all of your classic cocktails, but also several signature drinks. I had this floral\/fruity martini called the Fleur De Lis, and it was super good. They also have herby and spicy type of drinks too which I want to try, like the spicy pineapple margarita. \nAlso, we were celebrating the birthday of one of our friends, and they brought out a free cheesecake! It was incredible. \nLong story short, we had one of the best nights out at this bar. We will definitely be going back!
