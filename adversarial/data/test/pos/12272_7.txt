Really Guy? You endorsed this place on Triple D? You put your reputation on the line and did a segment on Big Jim's? I wasn't impressed with the food at all. The service was worse.              \n                 \nI ordered a half veggie hoagy and a bowl of vegetable soup. My friend Ross ordered a small pizza and a bowl of wedding soup. I was sipping on a pretty good Rooney pale ale which was the best part of the meal. A little while later our soup came in cups. We told the bartender we ordered bowls. Oops. I was fighting a cold and a nice hot bowl of vegetable soup would hit the spot. Still waiting for the soup, out came the pizza, looked good, tons of cheese and pepperoni, and my veggie hoagy.  My order was wrong again, I ordered a half and they gave me a whole Hoagy. No biggie, I'll take the other half home for a midnight snack. Still no sign of the soup! It was a pretty unremarkable hoagy. Lots of flavorless lettuce, green peppers, onion, and huge unchewable chunks of carrots, and worse, it was cold. I Was kind of hoping for some eggplant, roasted red peppers, grilled zucchini, you know a real veggie hoagy with some flavor and texture. Oh we'll, live and learn. Still no soup! Finally the bartender was finished watching TV and saw we were both out of beer, and I asked about the soup, he apologized and said he forgot. I said to Ross, I guess he must make a good hourly wage because he's not working for a good tip. Finally our soup was delivered and I pushed away that lousy hoagy and dived into soup. I blew on the spoonful of soup and Ross said \"you don't have to do that, it's cold.\" Damn! With a half eaten hoagy and a full bowl of soup sitting there, I asked for the check and paid and left. Never again Big Jim, never again! Guy, you lost points on this call.
