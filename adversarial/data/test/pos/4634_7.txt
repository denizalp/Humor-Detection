Two words come to mind when describing this pizza...flavorless and lifeless. It's not often that someone has the genius idea to build a brick and mortar around gas station pizza, but this feller apparently saw that as a million dollar idea. \n\nThe dough had zero air in it, and was half cooked. The sauce might as well have not been placed on it, as it was flavorless as well. Now comes the cheese...I'm guessing it's whatever Sysco's cheapest offering is.\n\nAfter trying this bastardization of pizza, I now know why they give you a free pizza for buying one. Next time I'm in the area, I'll search for a pile of dog vomit to eat. At least I'll know that it has some degree of flavor.
