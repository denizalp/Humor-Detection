This place has terrible customer service. I came in for a simple trim. I have long hair without any layers, and Danny managed to mess it up. He cut a random top layer four inches shorter than the rest of my hair. He also tried to hide his mistake by not blow drying my hair and putting it up in a wet knot-bun to send me on my way. I called the next day to speak with the manager to see how they could appease the situation and I was told she \"was on vacation and would get back to me\". The person on the phone wouldn't even provide a date she would be back. I called three weeks ago and have yet to hear back. I would recommend anyone steer clear of this place if one of their employees (Danny) could manage to completely screw up a light trim on plain, even, long hair and management doesn't even care about appeasing unhappy clients. I certainly won't be back.
