I came here the other day since I heard from a friend that there is a little docking area in Port Credit. When I got to this lot, it was hidden and you get a great view of Snug Harbour. The one and only thing I liked is that they have a marked loading and unloading vessel area so you can prep before docking. So when I was getting ready to dock, I paid the docking fee of $10 and went on with my business. I was backing out the car and letting my friend get the jet ski off the car. Not even a second after Im pulling out, this old man comes over and tells me to park the car over to another lot next to it. He seemed grouchy and very rude and walked around as if I'm trespassing or some criminal. I felt offended because I didn't even finish docking properly since the jet ski was shutting off at points. So I listened to that old man and parked my car in the other lot and he followed me, to see if I was doing as he was saying. Now I understand why that docking area isn't too busy because of the people that work there or hang around that place. I hope this guy changes his attitude or even leaves for that matter since I really enjoy being in Port Credit. I won't be docking here in near future, sorry.
