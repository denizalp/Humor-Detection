I had this bookmarked since I saw Nelsons review, but until I saw people saying there are French macarons, good French macarons, I about suggest this place to the BF every chance I get. \n\nWe finally made it a bit before closing so there was a lot sold out, but we managed to get a few of the \"must try\" on my list from stalking the pictures and reviews. \n\nFrench macarons are a big deal to me since they're my favorite confection. These are smaller and sloppier made than I'm used to but it's the taste that matter. The flavors are decent, but this was not quite there on the texture...I think the size is partly the reason. We both bought 2 of ginger, pistachio, cherry, peanut butter since it's too small to share.This is a hard thing to perfect so even though I'm a bit disappointed, it's not gonna effect me coming back. I'm happy to finally have a neighborhood bakery. I just will go to Bouchon or have my macarons shipped from Los Angeles. \n\nThe BFs mom is obsessed with finding pastries\/croissants with almond paste. Nothing has fit what she's looking for which I think she's looking for a marizpan consistency with a strong almond taste. None the less, we bought a slice of pithivier and a almond croissant for her to try. They were too eggy and not enough almond which I was expecting to happen so they were then for me. The pithivier was good specially when eaten warm. The almond croissant is the star. It was almond and chocolate which at first I was disappointed since I haven't ever liked chocolate croissants, but then I took a bite. Then I just wanted to shove the whole croissant in my mouth since it was delicious and addicting. Nice croissant texture, the right kind and amount of chocolate to compliment the almond. \n\nWe got the BFs grandma a puff pastry with berry in it and she disappeared off with it so she must've been very happy if she didn't share.\n\nI also got a plain croissant to make a sandwich at home.  It's crunchy and flaky outside and then the inside was just soft, buttery. Based on that, the pithivier and the almond croissant that they really know how to achieve the proper flake.\n\n A almond shell with what I was told was hazelnut cream caught my fancy. It was good buttery cream but it was not hazelnut....more like sweet cream. I liked it- definitely better than a cream puff. \n\nPetit Four was the BFs pick and it was like a black forest cake sans cherries. It was really goof cake texture and moist and the right amount of chocolate and liquor flavor. \n\nThe prices are reasonable for what they are. We spent about $25 for all of it. The almond shell w\/ cream being the most expensive treat at $4.50, $1 macarons, $2ish for the croissants, pithivier and petit four.\n\nWill be back very soon to try the savory side and come early so we can sample of the bread!
