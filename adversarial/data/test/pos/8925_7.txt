dear wildflower,\n\nokay, i forgive you.  we can be friends again.  now that i KNOW that you can get a half sandwich & soup, i did...and it was pretty tasty.  garlic tomato soup and the chicken salad...nothing amazing, but decent.  the reason you get another star was the service this time.  dude behind the counter was awesome, you should give him a raise, wildflower!  he got me samples of the soup and was super patient waiting for me to puzzle thru my complicated monkey mind to decide what sounded good.  a word of advice, you should put more salads on your menu for the \"wildflower two\" option.  three salads is not enuf to pick from, ESPECIALLY when one is a caesar!  anyway, like i said, i forgive you.  but, srsly, don't call or text every day...we aren't that kind of friend.  if i see you, i see you.  and, srsly, don't piss me off again...i don't want to have to egg you.\n\nbisdan,\nally
