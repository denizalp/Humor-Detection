A different location but same great service, same great food! \n\nIn-N-Out is always busy.  The drive through line is long but moves quickly.  Dining inside is the same.  Long line but again, moves very quickly.   The cashiers here are so friendly.  Service has been on point at every location I've dined at.  It's great to have the consistency across the board.  \n\nBurger and fries? Cheap, quick and delicious! My fries I request well done animal style.  Cheese, onions and sauce smothering the fries - I just can't get enough! \n\nAs far as fast food burgers, this is my go to place! Love it!
