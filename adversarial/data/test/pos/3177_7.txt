I have a very very soft spot in my heart for this Starbucks.  I spent my whole college life and a little bit after serving up Market Square's best coffee, tea and assorted goodies!\n\nI know I'm totally biased but I really do feel like this is the best Starbucks in the city!  No other store has such a cozy feel to it.  I may have fallen asleep in the big comfy chairs by the fireplace a couple times.  I mean, it was hard slingin coffee all day!  Especially when you have to get up at 5 AM to be there at 5:30 AM (yeah, I totally rolled out of bed to go to work).  \n\nIt gets SLAMMED around 6:30 or 7 with the before work crowd.  I can still remember people's faces and what they ordered.  I could never understand the woman who ordered a Venti (large) 8 pump white chocolate mocha with whip EVERY morning.  I guess girl needed her sugar to survive in the AM.  \n\nThe nice thing is they're ALWAYS open.  Much to the chagrin of me and my coworkers with the madness of LIght Up NIght and St. Patrick's day drunken festivities.  But it's nice for the tourists to stop in and grab a quick drink and some advice on where to go downtown on a Saturday morning.  I'm thankful now when I'm downtown on a Sunday because I know it's one of the ONLY places open!  It's just a really great place to meet a friend to catch up or sit and study.  Plus they offer free wi-fi, which is always a plus!\n\nJust remember, Barista's are people too!!  Grunting out \"tall coffee\" instead of a hello doesn't usually fly as a good greeting.  Cheer up, you're getting caffeine soon!
