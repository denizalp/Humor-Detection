I'm giving Cajun Queen five stars because I have been dreaming of their pan seared duck breast over crawfish etouffee hitting my lips since the moment I left. This was indisputably the best duck I've ever eaten and the etouffee was an AMAZING accompaniment. The decor and ambiance aren't necessarily the glitz and glam you find in DC's five star restaurants but there was a true essence of NOLA permeating the air from the time we walked in. This was largely in part to their house band located on the second floor playin live music we absolutely loved. There are photos \/ paintings throughout the restaurant of New Orleans staples but honestly..... I enjoyed Cajun Queen's food better than most things I are while I was in NOLA. \n\nFried green tomatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly and we ate every morsel on the plate.\nThe Fried oysters tasted phenomenal.\nMy gumbo was better than any gumbo I had in NOLA but I like spicy food so I added a dash oh hot sauce and sprinkle of black pepper that took it to perfection. The barbecue shrimp was out of this world, delicious. The sauce is soooooo good to sop up with the complimentary bread. Then there was this Oreo cheesecake that was one of my favorite cheesecakes I've ever tasted. Hubby thought his shrimp and grits were just ok but since our server was also pretty great, I could not find cause to deduct a star for that. \n\nIf you're looking for a unique dining experience in Charlotte that will make you feel like you've walked right into the French Quarter of NOLA without hopping on a plane or train, Cajun Queen is not to be missed. Sit upstairs to be close to the live band and utilize their complimentary valet.
