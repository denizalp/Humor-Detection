Great experience.  Very clean and health department inspection on front door displayed.  I was greeted by staff prior to open and we talked about the pastry.  I met the owners who were very nice business owners and were interested and focused on my questions.  I purchased a honey apple cake...not a slice but a whole cake.   Took it home opened up the lid ... Amy left a very sweet note on the lid.   Now.... I was raised on honey cake....and this is incredible!  I latter called to thank both owners on my experience.
