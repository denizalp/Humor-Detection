I used to have an aversion to Harkins , which I think began back in the days when Harkins meant sticky feet at Christown or risky life and limb at Metro Center. But my new image of Harkins is I dig Harkins.  \n I have noticed that they have excellent service. From the minute you enter to when you leave, their staff pretend to care and that's what I like. I love to believe when I am entering that I am beginning a little mini holiday. Hearing polite manners, and a little chit chat with the help supports my vacation feeling. Going to the movies has always been a special treat in my book and Harkins supports my fantasy.  The theater itself is nicely decorated with a big Hollywood feel. \nI really like the cleanliness,  rocking chairs,  99 refillable sodas and the wide range of food court items just in case we actually ever really need pizza or chicken tenders.   Way to go  Harkins.
