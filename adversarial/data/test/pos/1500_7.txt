Ok, so I didn't even know they were here, the last I knew it was still empty after the miserable failure of 3rd Place.  Could someone advertise or put up some flags\/banners to let people more than 10 feet away know you're open?  \n\nI am really glad to see that the Draft House is there.  The West Valley is so lacking in places to get a strong sampling of craft beers.  Everyone has the traditional domestics and usually 1 craft from 2 or 3 classes.  That's not the case here, though I still give their selection a 3 out of 5.  You're the tallest midget in the West Valley, but the selection is still largely corporate and lacks feel.  I have a sneaky suspicion that a large part of the reason for this are the local distributors, however.  Spread your wings a bit and really embrace the craft market and you'll see great results.  Also, you're not in Scottsdale, you don't have to be so proud of your \"premium\", \"ultra premium\" craft selections.  When I can get a six pack of what you're pouring at the local grocery store you can chill out on your pricing.  Seriously, doubling your volume but lowering your margin will make you more money.\n\nDid I mention doing things to let people know you're open?\n\nThe comments about the wait staff I think were maybe indicative of a brand new establishment that rushed to open without enough time for training.  We were greeted right away and shown to a table.  We were told who our server would be (Sophie) and she came around right away.  She brought us a couple of samples of beers to help us decide.  She knew the menu well and could give us sincere endorsements of items (try the hummus, and the green chili pastie).  I read the other reviews while I was at my table so I observed the rest of the wait staff.  Everyone seemed on their game, attentive and engaging, and there were typically 2 bartenders every time I looked.  The fries were terrific too.\n\nThe long and the short of it is I'm glad they're here and I will be back.  My fear is that they won't be there long because the beer is too expensive for what it is and there's nothing to draw people in. \n\nPS, get rid of the Union Jack.  There is nothing here that makes you seem the slightest bit like an English Pub.  Pasties on your menu?  Ooh, ahh.  You've got so much potential, don't cheapen yourselves.
