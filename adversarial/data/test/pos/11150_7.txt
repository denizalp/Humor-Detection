Nice family place with limited operational hours (evenings on Friday, Saturday, Sunday only). Chicago theme on the inside is cozy, with plenty of Bears, Bulls, & Cubs posters. Very modest atmosphere, perhaps dated, but cozy nonetheless and a place that is suitable for bring the entire family. Seems to be a small, local family-owned business as well.\n\nThin crust is like a thick cracker - flour bottom, crispy, yet still somewhat chewy. Sweet & tangy tomato sauce seems to draw people as well, as many of us from Illinois are familiar with the thin crust & extra sweet tangy sauce formula for pizza.\n\nAs of winter 2008, the menu consisted of pizza, a calzone like \"pizzoli\", and salads. No subs, eggplant, chicken, etc. that is mentioned in the Web Review.
