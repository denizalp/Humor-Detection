I'm going to go ahead and say this place sucks. \n\nThis place claims to be a \"Seattle style coffee shop\". After living in Seattle for a few years, and hitting every coffee spot in the city at least once, I think I can fairly comment on that. First off, the coffee is pretty good. It's definitely Seattle style coffee, though realistically not up to Seattle standards at all. That's alright, this is a coffee shop in Phoenix, where there are few (if any) shops that actually hold up to the quality of Seattle coffee. \n\nWhat really rubs me the wrong way, and definitely doesn't fit in with the Seattle element, is the service and staff at this place. I don't want to say this is the case with everyone that works here, as Ben and DJentrification (sorry I don't know your real name) have always been awesome whenever I've gone in, but the majority of people that work here are really stuck up. Maybe this should be stated another time and another place, but:\n\nDear Phoenix hipster:\n\nYou really aren't that cool. You just got into riding fixed gear bikes six months ago when anyone that lives in a real city knows it's been the only way to go for years. You just got into \"anarchist folk punk\" and \"psychadelic freak folk\" when all the cool kids have moved on to snorting coke and dancing naked in clubs to Yelle. You are behind. You really are not hip. If you lived in a real city (which hopefully Phoenix will become) you would not be considered hip. You would be considered what you are, a stuck up prick.\n\nSorry for the rant, but that leads me to the reason this is NOT a Seattle style coffee shop. In Seattle, there will be actual \"hip\" people working at the shop. These people will actually respect culture, art, fashion, design, music, and all the other \"cool kid\" shit. However, these people do not act above you. I get service when I get coffee in Seattle. In this place, I get treated like I'm not worthy of standing in the shitty old house that looks\/smells like the staff cleans it once every six months.\n\nI brought my mom here once after spending a day with her at the art gallery. We wanted to get a quick cup of coffee before I headed back to my apartment and she headed back to Mesa. While ordering the guy working the corner had a stupid smirk on his face the whole time and was rude to my mom and was way too pushy with trying to get her to decide what she wanted. He was making some comments to the girl that was working with him and they would look over at her and I and laugh. Look guys, I'm really sorry I'm not still stuck in teenage-angst mode and working for the local shitty coffee shop at 25. I value my moms time and will not put up with you treating her like shit. \n\nIf this was an isolated incident, I wouldn't even take the time to post this review. But this is the consistent attitude of the people that work at this place. I don't know if the management or owners are aware of this (or even worse, are the same way), but they should probably take a look at who they're hiring and the image it promotes about their business. I'm not shocked at all that this place moved to a far shittier location. A place that provides this level of service doesn't belong in such a beautiful neighborhood. Hopefully the historic house can be used for something other than housing a punch of pricks jerking eachother off over their latest 7\" scores. \n\nTwo stars for the coffee being pretty good whenever I've gone. The coffee is far better at Lux and Drip anyways.
