We LOOOOOOVE this steakhouse. The service isn't over the top like I'd expect, but I really do love the steaks. It's so tender and wonderful, and absolutely the most fabulous presentation... the plates are pre-warmed, and OH! the bread and ohmygodit'sjustsoeffinggood...\n\nI just exploded a little. You get the picture.
