Soya Street's owner is smart... having a banner advertising their drinks for $1.25... and then up sell you to their Black Sesame & Bean Soy Drink ($2). I did not realize I am not the only vulnerable one that fell for that.... \n\nBlack sesame gives soy milk a nutty flavor, as well as providing a rich source of manganese, copper, tryptophan, iron and fiber. Aside from the benefit... it does taste good!! \n\nI still waiting to see the nicer shiny coat (maybe he is wearing his raincoat?) and dark luscious hair (was that some grey!) from my fellow yelper...
