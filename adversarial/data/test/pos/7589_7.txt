Are you serious? Indian buffet for $9.99 in an ok neighbourhood? Why didn't anyone tell me about this? I went here for lunch today because I figured I needed a day off from sushi. It was a very pleasant change. \n\nThe food was good. Not the best in the city and pretty much devoid of heat. It was all tasty, though. There was also more \"stuff\" in the sauces than other buffets in town. Like there was actually paneer in the mutter paneer. The appearance of the naan put me off at first but it was actually delicious and buttery. The mango salad was really nice. The ice cream selection was good. Mmm pistachio kulfi and rose falooda. The kheer needed a visit from the cardamom fairy, though. \n\nI rated four stars because the food could use some more masala and I was the first person in the restaurant and the toilet was unflushed (gross). I'll definitely be going back, though. Awesome value for the money.
