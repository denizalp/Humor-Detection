I walked in here today and it was like a scene out of a musical. I can't even explain, everyone was so nice. They were perfectly cheery, explained all of their tea selections to me, laughed at my decision making process, and made me a delicious iced green mint tea.\n\nI sat down at a table and made eye contact with a handsome stranger. There were actually a lot of handsome strangers, maybe a good place to find a date!\n\nI smiled, put a little sugar in my tea, and was on my way, but not before ANOTHER handsome stranger held the door open for me and said he hoped I would have \"a lovely day.\"\n\nSo I clicked my heels, sipped my tea, and went off into the sunset.
