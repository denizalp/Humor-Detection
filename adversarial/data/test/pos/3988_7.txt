By far, my favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas! It's Brazilian-Japanese fusion, which is very unique. The quality of everything here is amazing and very fresh. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here. It doesn't have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have. The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip). The decor of the restaurant is pretty in-tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip, modern, and a little funky. They have great cocktail selection and a full bar, as well as a happy hour menu. \n\nSERVICE: 5 Stars.\nI've never had a single complaint about the service here. Every time we come here, the service is always consistent and excellent. We celebrated my friend's 21st birthday here with a group of about 20. After ordering countless rolls, plates of sashimi, cocktails and shots, our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots. Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later, my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba.\n\nFOOD\/DRINK: 5 Stars.\nEverything is so fresh and good. I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail, Uni, Fresh Ono, and Tuna. The  Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here. For non-sushi eaters, they have plenty of choices. They have a lot of unique cocktails custom to this restaurant that pair well with almost anything on the menu. \n\nYou will not be disappointed eating here!
