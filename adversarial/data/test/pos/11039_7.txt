After a traumatic life experience, when you realize how fragile life is, and how exactly important life is, what do you? You get a mother fucking tattoo!\n\nSo, my sister and I decided, we have the cash to blow, let's go get this \"sisterfriend\" tattoo that we've been talking about for forever. My sister wanted to head to a place that she had gone to before, but I don't like the vibe. I don't know if it's just me, but some tattoo shops, they look at you like, what the fuck are you doing here? and they're kind of fucking asshole pricks... Yeah, didn't encounter that here at all.\n\nOnce arriving at our  destination, I checked in on my faithful Yelp app (as we motha freakin' Elite do, y'all) and saw that I get One Free Belly Dance from Joey. While Joey went to get ready, my sister and I met with our tattoo artist, Ryan and Justin. I'm much more the princess type and my sister is much more Rock N Roll. We had an idea for a tattoo \"So different, yet so the same, two sisters\" and one day, I cleverly realized we couldn't have the same exact tattoo. They will read the same, but the style will be different. These guys got it. Ryan does amazing print work. Did a beautiful cursive flowy print that could be highlighted with my sisters and I's favorite colors. Ryan came up with this really awesome Rock N Roll font. While the guys set up shop, Joey came out and bellydanced! He was awesome and everyone in the shop was grinning ear to ear. Big props for Joey! You're awesome, dude.\n\nJustin and Ryan banged out our tattoos and they turned out perfect. Better than I could have ever, expected. Told us to come back if we needed any touch ups once the pieces were healed.\n\nThe shop was clean, the guys were warm and welcoming, and if I'm getting more ink, I will for sure be hitting up Downtown Tattoo! Great artist, great shop!\n\nPro Tip: PARKING IN THE REAR. CASH ONLY.
