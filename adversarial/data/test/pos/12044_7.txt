Only came in for a quick pitcher (there's such a thing) because we were meeting friends across the street for dinner.\n\nI met up with one of the people like me who are usually early for every get together... relax I've been last to show, once.  Back to the Beer Station yes it's a place for beer and they have a lot of selection so if you like beer whether draft, talls, bottles from here, there or everywhere you have choices.\n\nPitchers run under 20 bucks and while the dog days of summer may be considered patio weather sometimes it's just too damn hot to not want the AC, shade and some nice TV that you can see in a place that's as cool but not as cold as the drinks they serve.  \n\nThe Beer Station is a place for quickies, beer that is and hey if you want to stick around and watch a game or two it's a love story, just say yes.  Yes, that's a Taylor Swift reference.... what?  I like her.
