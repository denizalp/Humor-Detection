Raku is consistently great!  It is easily one of my favorites in town!\n\nAs a kid I practice Judu. I had a Sensei that used to say \"spread the spirit of nurturing rightness.\" I had no idea what he meant then and I'm still trying to figure it out now. I do know that Raku is doing a lot right when it comes to incredibly delicious dishes!...they are probably ahead of me in spreading the spirit of nurturing rightness. I'm okay with that, but if you haven't shared in this experience you might want to get in on what they're nurturing over there because it is downright scrumptious!\n\nSome of the standards that I usually go with include:\nUdon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup (I adore this...one of those items you crave days later)\nCold Green Tea Soba with Poarched Egg\nKurobuta Pork Cheek\nDuck with Balsamic Soy Sauce\nYellowtail Carpaccio\nSteamed Foie Gras Egg Custard\nFish Belly\n\nI also really appreciate the following:\nAgedashi Tofu\nKen² Salad\nKobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi\nKobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic\nButter Sautéed Scallop with Soy Sauce\n\nNo visit would be complete with a few orders of their skewered veggies & mushrooms...you can get them wrapped in bacon, but they are beautiful on their own.\n\nDessert offers some excellent options, including Melting Chocolate Cake and Green Tea Crème Brulée...but if you've taken the time to come here why not spend a little more time in the same shopping center and go to Sweets Raku for a complete experience?...unless you ate too much at Raku of course. Oh, and speaking of complete experiences, you can always opt to partake in one of their Omakase options that go for $75 or $100 per person.\n\nBe sure to check out the special board for some truly pleasing selections...these will typically run you a little more, but are often incredible.  There are places I like as much as Raku, but not many that I like more for my money...it is easy in this town to spend two or three times as much for the same quality and execution of food. In fact I'm not sure I'd argue with someone that said Raku is the best for the money in Vegas.\n\nCome here...make some reservations first, but come here!
