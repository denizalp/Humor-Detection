When it comes to tea DavidsTea is the bee's knees. Remember the first time you tried \"fancy coffee\" and you had no idea what you were doing nor did the staff make you feel comfortable? That was me yesterday but instead I was welcomed with open arms. \n\nThe staff are really knowledgeable and provide recommendations based on your tastes and give testers out to ensure you like it. They are willing to spend as much time as necessary sniffing and tasting teas to ensure you are happy with the tea you've bought and walk out with a bit more knowledge, or in my case, a lot more knowledge of teas than when you arrived. \n\nThey have cool tea cups, steepers, and other funky tea contraptions that I'm thinking of picking up. There isn't a place to sit but who needs to sit when you're sniffing different teas. I ended up with a matcha green tea with brown rice in it in a large resealable canister. With that canister you receive a discount next time you buy tea. \n\nOverall, some of the most attentive service I've had anywhere and the prices are reasonable. Can't go wrong with DavidsTea and I recommend everyone go!
