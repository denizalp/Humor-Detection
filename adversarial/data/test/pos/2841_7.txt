Ive been going to this establishment, oops, let me rephrase...DUMP...for awhile now.  Always had pretty good service, and I do like the chicken fingers very much.\nLet me explain why i am rating this a 1star\nAfter work I met a friend there for some late night fingers and fries, as soon as we sat down, some crazy drunk dude was falling all over himself and had to be escorted out, and found out that in the parking lot he took a WHIZ right in front of the entrance, GROSS...next after the waitress \"Kristen\" brought my fingers, she immediately said I had to pay the bill cause her \"Manager\" said so! What!!!! YEA! Ok if they wanted to close out for the night, she could have said it a different way, and I told her I was going to order more food later...turns out she never came back for a tip or to collect the money from my second order that I got which was the disgusting jalapeno rings(YUCK!).\nAND the bartender was rude when I asked for a pack of matches and wanted the 4.29 for the damn jalapeno things, I asked for the check, which he did not offer and my friend just handed him 7.00\nREALLY?????????\nUMMMMMM NO, that is all wrong\nThey lost a loyal patron\nI will never go out of my way to drive there again, thanks
