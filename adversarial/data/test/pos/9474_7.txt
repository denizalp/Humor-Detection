This is not a four star restaurant as it is rated on Yelp. This is just a nice place to watch a game. There are big TV monitors inside. The service is very slow and prices are too high according to the food they serve. The stuff was not attentive at all. Food came out very slow: took them about 45 minutes.  Everything is baked, not fried. I had regular wings, they were baked, but they were not done well. The wings were not well seasoned. The food tasted as if it was thawed improperly. The sauces were not good enough. \nOur drinks came out very slow. EVERYTHING HERE WAS SLOW.....
