So if my best friend in the world was in town and wanted to have a beer, this is the place I'd take him.\n\nThis is my best buddy, so he deserves the best beer.  Naturally that means the most unique, tastiest and most importantly, of the highest alcohol content.  The best also isn't cheap, but this is my best friend we're talking about here.\n\nIt's not just about the beer, this is a straight up cool place to hang out.  I didn't have them but they mussels smelled amazing.\n\nRound it up with a friendly and accommodating staff  and you've got the makings of a world class bar!
