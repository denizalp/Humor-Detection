NO matter how busy they are = on the phone, delivery orders, internet orders, eat-in or take out, they ALWAYS do a bang up job! The staff is always friendly, patient  and accommodating,\n Was just there tonight and got the dinner for 2.....could be for 4 but lets keep that a YELP secret! \nFor $31 taxes in, you get 4 meat skewers of your choice mix and match....pork, chicken, beef and perhaps laaaamb, 2 rice, 2 potato, 2 greek salad, 2 pita. taziki,  and 2 cans of sugary, fizzy delight AKA pop.\nMy husband is a big eater and he gobbles everything up and STILL has left-overs. I usually eat all the salad, one chicken skewer and pita, but I skip the potatoes and rice....saving the left overs for lunch....if my husband doesn't  get to them first!\n\nThe chicken is ALWAYS done to perfection. Super tasty taziki, good for ye olde gaaalic burps after! They recently changed the feta cheese on the salads to a waaaay betta one...it used to be like \"shredded feta\" ( if that exists), now I fell it is more of a proppa fetta!!!!!\nJust a stand up, kick arse meal..... enough for a hearty feed for dinner and leftovers to boot for 31 bones.....you kanny go wrong.
