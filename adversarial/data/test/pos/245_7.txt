Snakes and Lattes has changed and gained it's popularity so much over the years. I remember my first time coming here back in 2010 and I know they renovated, so the layout is completely different than what it used to be. I personally think it's a lot less cozy now because they house more guests.\n\nAnyways, it's $5 per person if you just want to play games here, I think you're able to sit as long as possible, well when I came here I was able to sit as long as possible. Each of the drinks and foods are add ons. The lattes are made very nicely, though I'm not a big fan of their foods. I got a quiche one time and it was kind of cold and not very delicious.\n\nThe waiters are very nice and are able to recommend games for the group all the time depending on what they enjoy playing. They were also accomodating because apparently when I came a bit later, the spot I was sitting in was a fire hazardous spot and after seeing how dissapointed I was because I literally took 2 hours to come down and see my old classmates that I haven't seen for five years, they said it was okay for this time only.\n\nAfter snakes and lattes gained in popularity, many other cafes began to open following the concept of snakes and lattes in terms of being a board game cafe, but SNAKES AND LATTES will always be the original one in my heart.
