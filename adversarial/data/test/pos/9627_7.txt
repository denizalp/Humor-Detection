SIX STARS!!!  SIX STARS!!!!!\n\nPerusing through some of the older Yelp reviews about Studio B, it looks like management has taken some notice and made some user-suggested improvements.  Gone are the days of \"WTF is that?\" or \"Uhhh is that THIS sauce or THAT sauce?\"  I love the way they write on the protective glass.  I think buffets that have little wedding-style name cards are tacky as hell.\n\nAnyway, this was undoubtedly the crown jewel in this little weekender visit my bro and I had planned well in advance.  As it seems that word has indeed gotten out, the line looked hella long, so we retreated to 32 Degrees (the outstanding beer bar in the M Resort) to get a tall glasses and then head back to the line.  However, as my brother gimped away from the buffet area, a kind young worker said flirtatiously to him, \"Sir, you can bypass the line and use the VIP line for handicap.\"  Niiiiice.  Alvin would now like to thank the Academy for this honor.\n\nDespite being cut in front of by a bunch of old touristy types, and me missing out on the players club discount because I was too damn lazy to do it when we arrived, we paid, were seated, and went to town.  Crab legs (hot and cold), oysters, cocktail shrimp, sushi rolls, and sashimi virtually buried our first plates.  The oysters -- undoubtedly the true highlight of our Studio B experience -- were fresh and plump, and the sashimi had yellowtail!  We truly were in heaven.\n\nWhat happened after the first plate was just a pseudo-drunken mish-mosh of food and alcohol.  We took full advantage of the wine bar -- beer was Generic Lite and PBR, if I recall correctly -- and just about every other luscious food item around.  Korean BBQ short ribs, prime rib, cedar plank baked salmon, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, black bean clams, green curry, beef satay, clam chowder -- ALL phenomenal.  I think it is crucial to mention that each and every single one of these menu items ON THEIR OWN could merit a strong review in any other non-buffet setting.  There wasn't a single item Alvin or I had that we just said \"meh\" about.  The service -- albeit occasionally slow, but homie was cool -- was very kind at every station we visited, and everything just seemed clean, clear, and distinctly organized.  One of the best parts about it, I do have to say, is since the M Resort is *sort of* out of the way for most tourists, you have your awesome mix of Vegas locals and people who REALLY REALLY want a great seafood buffet and are willing to travel outside the confines of the Rio.  So, bottom line, very slim chance of douchebaggery encounters here, thank goodness!\n\nSo you'd think after a half-season of the Deadliest Catch sitting at our table and enough alcohol lingering about to make Amy Winehouse do a double take, we were done.  NOPE!  Dessert was, for lack of a better less cliched term, mouth-gasmic.  My personal favorites were the chocolate lava cake, the creme brulee, the pecan tart, the fruit tart, the tiramisu, and the espresso bar.  Okay, wait, that's basically everything we had!  Typically my bro is not a huge dessert person, but here he was, oohing and aahing like Julia Child.  There is nothing so satisfactory and life-completing in this world than a spoonful of Studio B's chocolate lava cake accompanied by a Bailey's laden double espresso.\n\nEat at Studio B's seafood buffet.  Do it before the masses catch on!
