I was excited to see this place open and thought it would be great have another lunch spot in the area. The experience was disappointing.\n\nAs others have mentioned, they really do nickel and dime you. I was originally planning to get the $11 grilled shrimp plate, and when I asked if I could substitute the rice with veggies, they said that there would be a $2 charge. Come on...are veggies really THAT much more expensive? Just substitute it! This is not a way to do business. I wasn't going to pay $13 for shrimp and veggies from a walk-up-to-the-counter place!\n\nI thought I would go with the cheaper $10 grilled shrimp salad. I asked for dressing on the side, but when I got my order, the dressing was mixed in; they also forgot to add the roasted peppers. The most ridiculous part was, it came with THREE SMALL shrimps; the bulk of it was spring mix. I spoke with the lady that put my order together and she confirmed that the salad does only come with three shrimps, but that she would remake the salad without the dressing. \n\nThe lady was friendly and the manager checked up on me at some point, but that was the only positive part of my visit. The salad was boring and unsatisfying. For that price, they could at least add avocado, an egg, or something more filling....perhaps more shrimp?\n\nI hope they get their act together. For now, be prepared to spend a good amount of money and leave hungry. I am sure they are making a whopping profit!
