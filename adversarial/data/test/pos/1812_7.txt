I don't know how this place has 4.5 stars... I'm pretty easy to please- and was not happy with my experience. I ordered the Thai chicken wrap and a small fruit plate. Total came to $15, and the wrap was pretty small, and included a very small portion of cucumbers. I ate my wrap, although it didn't taste very good- and in my last few bites, I pulled out a large piece of plastic (from either a glove or plastic wrap, not too sure) I let one of the workers know, and she showed the chef, and he said \"sorry\" \n\nI know sometimes that stuff happens, but at least try to make up for it. Should have been offered something... anything (other than just an apology) The fruit plate was good, but it's kinda hard not to get that right. I will not be returning to this spot unfortunately.
