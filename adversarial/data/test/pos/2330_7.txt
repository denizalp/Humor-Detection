Walked out bfore ordering!\nWent for a quiet dinner. However, there was a very loud intoxicated man singing and talking vulgar at the bar. The bar staff and patrons proceeded to try and out-shout each other, laugh boisterously, and generally, making everyone else in the resturant miserable. The wait staff apologized over and over and voiced our complaint to the bar tender but the problem was never handled.
