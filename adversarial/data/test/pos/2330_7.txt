I love coming here more for the hot foods and smoothie\/juice bar than the actual groceries. The salad bar is a little pricey but you get the best ingredients. They also have the best French fries I've ever tasted made fresh at the pizza counter. Hot soups of all kinds are all over and they have an Asian, burger\/BBQ, Mexican and pizza stand. They also sell all kinds of alcoholic beverages and have a bar. Whole Foods is not only America's healthiest grocer, it's a place to sit down, have a great meal, and a damn good time! Staff is awesome, too.
