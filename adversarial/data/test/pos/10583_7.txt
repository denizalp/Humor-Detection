Thought I'd give brunch a try at Touch, brunch being one of my favorite meals. The server gave me strange looks when I walked in, probably due to my unparalleled beauty, either that or my fabulous hat. \nThe menu was not too crazily varied, if you like eggs, you're in luck.  Although egg whites were available, they were not on the menu.  I went w\/ a simple veggie omelet & asked for no cheese or shrooms and rye toast. I'm picky, yeah, but I'm sweet about it. Did I mention that my cuteness lets me get away with more too?  I was sad to see the omelet came w\/ cheese and wheat toast.  I felt bad, but had to send it back. Also, I had to request refills every time I needed one.  The server was kind, but just plumb weird. \n\nThe food was so-so, the music was good, the service was not great, but I loved the space. I might go back; probably just for drinks. \nTouch has potential. Needs some finesse.
