I was really excited to try Chez Vous.  My parents saw it featured on a AZ food show, so off we went for a weekend lunch.  I was not impressed.  Maybe it was an off day.  The service was nice, very Parisian, but it was a bit pushy.  The older woman who waited on us had so much perfume on that every time she came to the table I was overcome with the smell of it.  Not appetizing.  She was nice, but it was just too much.  I'm very sensitive to perfume, so too bad.\n\nAnother thing I didn't care for was that they were busing the table in the hallway near the bathrooms.  Dropping all the dishes in a tub.  It was really loud.  Just tossing plates and silverware in there made a tone of noise.  Really unappealing.  \n\nHonestly I was not impressed with their crepes and neither were my parents.  I had some chicken creme thing, and it was bland to me.  Very boring.  We had a dessert crepe, and it was rubbery.  I just don't get the hype.  I think Crepe Bar does a better job with crepes, theirs are outstanding.
