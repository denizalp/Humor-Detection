The service here is sort of weird! The worker here did not seem friendly, but that's fine I just came here for some Hawaiian food. \n\nThis chain satisfies my cravings for my usual order: \n*BBQ Mix*: beef, chicken, and short ribs.. so much food along with the rice and mac salad it comes with! Savory goodness in every bite. =] \n\nOverall, when in the area of South Las Vegas right in the area of the outlets.. this L&L's is blah for service, but still delicious for the hungry!
