With days and counting until my FARC buddy Deanna relocates to NYC the girls who love the meat were on the loose again this evening trying to squeeze in a few last restos until we have to say adieu. Tonight we hit up Negroni, one of the latest additions to the trough of the College street eateries. I'm writing this review in intervals because I'm busy chowing down the leftovers of what I refer to as the Holy Trinity of panini's. This was a dessert panini filled with mascarpone, Nutella and fresh sliced strawberries, grilled to piping hot crunchy perfection and finally dusted off with powered sugar. Even cold this panini still delivers an orgasm factor of flavour and lip smacking goodness. Forgive me Father for I have sinned. Pass me the panini, I'm going to hell. \n\nNegroni is a comfy, laid back spot which was described by a previous Yelper as doing one thing good and doing it very, very well and that is grilling up panini's. Oddly enough dessert, which was comped to us by the manager was the only panini we tried. We opted for a meat plate and a cheese plate and were very pleased with both. \n\nThe cheese plate consisted of Tallegio, Piave, Gorgonzola and one of my most personal favorite Italian cheeses, Rochetta, which is goat's milk, sheep's milk and cow's milk combined. The meat plate was made up of smoked duck breast, a porcetta that had a maple smoked glazed on its crust, a Niagara proscuitto, some tasty smoked Chorizo sausage and little bowl of the house pate. There were side condiments such as a spicy red current jelly and a carmelized onion spread. \n\nTo compliment this we also ordered some oven roasted tomatoes, intermixed with some Buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil and a really delicious fresh pesto that had a beautiful body and consistency to it. I often find pesto to be over processed and oil laden, this was not the case. Our server brought us an additional plate of stacked pieces of grilled toasts that had been lightly drizzled with some olive oil. He thought with all the nibbling we were doing that we'd want the extra bread. Throughout the evening the service was excellent and I really like when the staff genuinely engage you in talking about the food. \n\nAll this delicious cheese and meat got washed down by a couple of glasses of a very light but delightful Sangiovese. I must say the pour on the wine was uber generous and our waiter poured right at our table. \n\nDea dragged me in to Negroni mostly because of the peanut butter ice cream which has jelly drizzled over it. It's a PB&J in a bowl and for some odd reason it works. \n\nI would most definitely return to Negroni and to be candid they are breath of fresh air in the clutter of the College street restos. The place is spotlessly clean, there is not a pretentious bone in the place, the price point is so reasonable for both food and drink and the quality of the food is excellent. The chef is a young woman who is a grad of George Brown College and I like her style. The combinations of panini's that Negroni is offering is adventurous.  How about asparagus with Asiago and oven roasted tomatoes?  Sure beats the hell outta of the standard panini \"sangwiches\" we are usually subjected to.  \n\nGot a few mouthfuls left to chow down so later peeps.  The Holy Trinity is whispering my name.....eat me....eat me.....eat me....
