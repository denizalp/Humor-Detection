By far one of the poorest restaurants in the area. They told me that since I am twenty five years of age and have valid out of state drivers license that I am unable to purchase liquor because it is not horizontal. They said this was Arizona state law, which it is not. If you are going to refuse service at least know your laws. The food is poorly composed and is in massive portions. Would never return to this establishment.
