So this place has an awesome set up, very modern almost futuristic decor with a rameni bar in the middle. \nThey played music from James Brown to Aaliyah and crazy mix ups!  On their flat screen they were showing some galactic anime that I wasn't familiar with but it was entertaining. Server was dressed in classic white collared shirt and black skinny tie. He told us the place is family owned and he is also related to the owners.\nAnyways...\nI started off with a Thai ice tea that was prefect.\n\nHere's all the stuff we order!\nScale 1-5 (1= nasty - 5= food porn)\n\nWaffles with sausage, egg & chz: 4.5\nTrinity sliders(pork, caramelized onions, tomato & garnished with scallions on a nicely toasted bun): 5\nSeafood kimchi ramen: 3.5 (skimpy on seafood but broth was Yum)\nGrilled pork Ribs: 4\n\nI can see this becoming the new hip & trendy spot to eat.\nServer let us know they have a secret menu that changes daily & is posted on their Facebook.\nCome to find out our server was also the general manager, Xalan. Extremely attentive, accommodating, and professional, not to mention nice.\nHe also told us since they're waiting for their liquor license to process they'll be bringing in some exotic Asian beers and pairings for future menus to come. Seems like a very promising place. Definitely coming back.
