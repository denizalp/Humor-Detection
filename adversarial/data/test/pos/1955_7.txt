Ate here for lunch! I got the bento box. It was good. Only eight bucks and worth every penny. The teriyaki chicken was really impressive and the salad and soup were great. Tons of food! \n\nThe drink cups are minute but service was so good my glass was never empty.\n\nI would be back in a heartbeat to order this again, it was well worth it. The only gripe would be that a huge massive chunk of wasabi was placed\/hidden under my teriyaki chicken...I hate wasabi, I=I ate it, almost cried, thought I was going to die, lol.
