Update: Today the Coke was  only average... there was something not quite right, the ratio of ice in the glass  (which according to most experts should be between 0.36 and 0.39) was only about 0.25 and there was no lime, can you believe it? this just ruined what could have been another day in paradise.\n\nTo make matters worse, they still don't take American Express, but they continue to use trip trays with the Amex logo, and the same logo is displayed on the front door, creating chaos and confusion among tourists and locals alike. I tried to pay with my American Express card only to be ridiculed by the staff, then my friend also tried to use my card and he couldn't pay either !!! We both pointed at the Amex logo on the tray while making a very distinctive confused-annoyed facial expression that took the waiter by surprise, so there were a few minutes of awkward silence, after which we proceeded to sigh, then the waiter tried to defuse the bomb by pretending the whole thing was just a misunderstanding.\n\nThere is however a more importanter issue here, what's the name of this place??? Is it Truly Thai???? Is it Mai Thai???? Is it both?????  there has been continuous debate about within  the community, but no one seems to have the right answer.
