My son is now into lesson #6 of the Bully Proof - Little Champs program.  I was apprehensive at first because I didn't know how my 5 YO would react to the program.  I also didn't know what to expect either.  But my son loves it and so do I.  Mr. Val & Mr. Adam are patient, fun yet stern with the kids.  They teach them how to speak up, have a voice.  They teach them how to be confident and disciplined.  They teach them how to defend themselves.  All the characteristics that I was looking for my son.  I was also worried because my son has a short attention span and didn't know how he'd do in a class of 10+ kids.  But I was assured that this was normal behavior and that in time, he'll be more focused. This is just all new to him.  I am happy we signed him up and look forward to seeing this young little boy turn into a confident little man!
