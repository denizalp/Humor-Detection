3 words: SO MUCH FUN!! \n\nThis place brings me back to my childhood. There are rows and rows of pinball machines, some old and some new. The older pinball machines are cheaper and more nostalgic. There are also old school video games like Pacman, Tetris, Galaxia and my favorite Duck Hunt. It definitely brought out the competitive side in me. If you forgot to bring quarters, don't fret! There are change machines everywhere. The cool thing about the change machine is that if you only have a $20 bill, it'll change $5 worth of quarters and give you back three $5 bills. One star docked because a lot of the games were broken and the bathroom was a little gross. \n\nIt's sad that kids these days won't know the joy that these games used to bring. If you are looking for a few hours of fun for cheap, this is definitely your place.
