I like Z Gallerie. If for nothing other than checking out their displays for arrangement ideas for my place. \n\nI like the color schemes and the way that some of the furniture arrangements. The associates are helpful to where I sometimes feel bad for pretending to be shopping when I'm just looking for the next way I'm doing my bedroom or dining room. \n\nAnyway, the prices aren't bad when things are on sale - considering most Z Gallerie's are in malls. And considering it's furniture, most stores are clean and organized because it's not like a shopper can just pick up a bed or couch, walk around with it then leave it some where because they don't want it.
