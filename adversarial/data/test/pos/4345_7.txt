Rivea is the BEST KEPT SECRET in Las Vegas. INCREDIBLE VIEW, Gorgeous food, well trained and attentive staff. WORTH every penny. It's a MUST. The Delano Hotel is so gorgeous you will be happy to even walk through the lobby to get to RIVEA!\n\nLocated on the 64th floor, it has a serene and artistic underwater feel. You can dine on the patio or indoors with one of the greatest views in all of Las Vegas without all the tourists!!!! Don't miss it! Have a cocktail first at next door SKYFALL. HEAVEN!!!!!!!
