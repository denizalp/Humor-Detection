I wanted to give 0 stars, but that's not an option.\n\nMy friend and I stayed at Planet Hollywood towers for 2 nights, and thought we'd check out The Cosmopolitan for our 3rd. Big mistake. Big. Huge.\n\nWe arrived at 4 pm on Sunday. We waited in line to check in for no less than 30 minutes. We watched as a few people in front of us argued with the front desk, and wondered what was the matter. We finally made it to the front and were told that there were no rooms available. We had a reservation, but they were out of rooms. We were then told by the very nice young man (I know it's not his fault), that it would be 3-5 minutes until a room would be ready, and we'd get a call on our cell.\n\nWe decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited 3-5 minutes. After waiting 20 minutes at the bar while 6 bartenders walked around and ignored us, we finally got a drink, but no phone call. After 30 minutes we went back to the front desk to ask about our room. The line was still absurdly long, so we went to the concierge. She was also very nice and went to get the front desk manager for us. We explained the situation and he told us that our room would be complimentary and that they would put a rush on cleaning our room. I'm not sure what they were doing for all the other people waiting in line who didn't complain, but I couldn't start a revolution.\n\nThe room was fine, whatever, but it clearly had not ever been occupied. The refigerator was unplugged with wires hanging inside (it was stocked, with warm drinks), a piece of the freezer was sitting on the counter, and the living room lamp was still wrapped in plastic.\n\nClassy.\n\nTwo more notes about the Vesper Bar in the lobby: 1) they ran out of Jameson. Yes, Vegas ran out of booze. 2) there is a bartender with a fauxhawk who needs to be taken down a few notches. Or just taken down in general.\n\nThe hotel itself is probably fine, but the service is terrible and the fact that they don't have rooms is just unbelievable. \n\nOn a positive note, Jaleo is a great restaurant with awesome service.
