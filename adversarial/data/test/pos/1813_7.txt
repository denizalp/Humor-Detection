I was going to write a two word update.\n\nAnd those two words would have been \"Tot Cho's\"...a thoroughly delightful creation that they serve at the Arcadia Tavern...Tater Tots with nacho stuff all over them:) Yeah, that's right...nacho tot's!\n\nThe Beautiful Carin and I beginning to make a nuisance of ourselves here:)\n\nFixtures, denizens, habituates...\n\nThe patio has become a bit of a \"home away from home\" (but with drink's that I don't have to mix myself:)\n\nWe keep showing up:)\n\nLast week, Carin correctly guessed the number of golf balls in the vase in the entryway, and she won us free drinks and food:)\n\nMatt (the owner) is thinking of adopting us (although that would technically make Carin and I brother and sister...both creepy and hot at the same time:)\n\nWe haven't had a bad meal or bad experience yet...tonight they had a Jimmy Buffett (or Boofay, for my friend Ryan) clone , softly playing guitar and singing during happy hour:)\n\nI am happy:)
