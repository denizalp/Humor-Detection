We haven't been in this area since my disaster of an experience a few doors down(Refer to my Xtreme Sushi review) but with all the high ratings, I knew we'd make it here one day.\n\nYes, it is clear across town, yes, we're up by Mt. Charleston, Yes, I am that person who'll drive AAAAAAALL the way to Hendertucky for the best Snow Ice in town, and Yes, there are too many whiner vaginers who make a big deal because of the distance travelling farther than outside of their hood....two answers for you-1) Stay home, or\n2) Make like Rhianna and SHUT UP AND DRIVE!!!!\n\nBreakfast\/Brunch is my absolute favorite meal of the day, and we're always looking for another spot to add into our breakfast\/brunch rotation. I like the quirky atmosphere here. Everyone is so welcoming as you walk in, spinning umbrellas up on the ceiling, waitresses in pajamas like they just rolled out of bed ready to serve you. Puts a smile on your face..:) One weird thing was the \"Help us...Yelp us\" on the back of the busboys' shirts. Don't know if that's against Yelp policy, but its not like they need to do that....They have a great fan base, and great food!\n\nMenu selections here are plentiful, and our waitress Riley was AWESOME SAUCE! She was very informative, personable, and offered up suggestions, popular items, and even her personal favorites. when we narrowed it down, we split the Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles and The Ultimate Steak and Eggs Plate, with the potted bread(Took a page from Jamms?) as our bread choice, with some fresh squeezed OJ(they use Navel, not Valencia) Two HUGE chicken breasteses were fried to perfection-crisp, well seasoned exterior, and the inside stayed nice and juicy and went perfectly with the crisp, light waffle drizzled with the cinnamon infused syrup, which was unfortunately Log Cabin. The ribeye was a perfect medium rare as requested, and the hash browns were not your typical out of the box type and you can tell it was made in house. Nice and crisp on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside. As popular as they are, the potted bread didn't arrive until after we were done with breakfast. No one's fault though, as Riley even offered another bread choice, we chose to wait. Its kinda like a little Cinnabon in a flower pot that comes with a cream cheese glaze on the side and was a great ending to our meal.\n\nDefinitely can't wait to come back to attack their Sweet Cream Pancakes, Chilaquiles, and other popular items.   ALOHA!!!
