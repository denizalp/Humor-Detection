These folks might be able to kill bugs, but I'll never find out. What they can do is DUMP GARBAGE all over a neighborhood of mostly seniors, who then have to pick it up.\n\nPreventive Pest Control uses leaflets instead of junk mail. Either they dump, or hire people, to dump hundreds of these flyers in neighborhoods advertising their service. Our neighborhood got hit last week. Since we're near Sun Lakes, many in our community are seniors. Did they need to be picking up 4, 5, 6 or more flyers\/postcards off their driveways, lawns, flowerbeds, bushes???\n\nNO! It's littering on private property, and nearly every house got hit! A week later, and walking around the neighborhood, you still see their garbage in people's yards, driveways, and in the street.\n\nIf they come clean up their garbage, I'll take down this review. Until then, they are more of a problem than the pests they want us to pay them to eliminate.\n\nMaybe we should all dump our garbage at your house? Easy enough to look up at the ACC, you know.
