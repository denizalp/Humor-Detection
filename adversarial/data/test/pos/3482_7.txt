This was a delightful relaxing couple hours. Starting out, plenty of parking, staff is very warm and friendly. The ticket office\/ gift shop\/theatre is across the street from the grounds. I started with a very interesting movie and then on to a limo like shuttle bus that brought me to the estate. \n     Mr Newton shares his love of the men and women who are and have served in the military. He has cases and cases of memorabilia related to military, astronauts, famous politicians and celebrity's. He also shared his \"crazy cool\" car collection. I've never seen anything that even comes close to this cool.\n     Next I saw his beautiful horses, 7 generations bred right on this ranch. Next his private collection of exotic birds and animals. So much fun to see.\n     Back across the street I just couldn't leave without visiting the gift shops. I really wanted to take some of this place home with me. I made my purchases and as I was leaving I was given a long stem red rose.\n   I have fallen in love and I will be back with my friends!!!
