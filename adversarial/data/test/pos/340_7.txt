Is the Aria nice? Absolutely!  The rooms are great, contemporary and spacious.  The view of the strip is fantastic!  Most of all I LOVED the automatic curtains and control tablet that allows you to control virtually EVERYTHING in your room.  There is a good morning setting that opens the curtains and turns on the music and there is a sexy goodnight setting that closed the curtains and turns on relaxing, sexy music.  Nice Touch!!!  The shower and bathtub set up is pretty cool too. \n\n Is the Aria worth the price?? Absolutely not!  Apart from the few perks in the room this hotel really doesn't have much going for it in my opinion.  There is no food court to speak of and everywhere you can go to eat is exceptionally high priced and lacking in flavor to say the very least.  If the dining options were at least good it would be different, but the food just wasn't good.  The pool area is nice, but the cocktails are outrageously priced $32 for a 32 ounce pitcher of mojito, yikes!  Too much for a mixed drink if you ask me.\n\nI suppose if you are a couple and have the money to spend this place is nice, I would just recommend taking a taxi and grabbing a bite elsewhere.
