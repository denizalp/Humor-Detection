I'm obsessed with the Sushi Pizza!!! It is delish and everytime I'm on business in Toronto Fune is a must visit. \n\nI have never been disappointed with anything else I've ordered and the service is always outstanding. \n\nI usually sit in the main dining room and I love the red and dark wood walls. I have yet to take a seat at the cool sushi bar, where wooden boats of sushi float around....maybe next time.\n\nI love you sushi pizza!!
