I don't usually get up early in the morning on a Saturday\/Sunday... but when I do, I go to this park. \n\nThey have a nice path to walk around so it's perfect for hatching them pokemom eggs. There's like 10 or more pokestops around the park too, so if you're (still) into pokemon go, this place is perfect! \n\nParking is not a problem. There's parking lot by Wigwam Ave and a bigger parking lot on Maryland Pkwy side. \n\nThere's a baseball field, basketball courts, and a \"beach\" volleyball area. The park is in great condition. Daughter loves the playground. Glad we live close to this park.
