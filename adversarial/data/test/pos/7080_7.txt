Wow! What a total disappointment this place turned out to be! There was a bit of a line but with several employees on the clock, they did a poor job of getting the food out in a timely manner. They must have just been cooking one order at a time... whatever the problem, it was very inefficient. \n\nBut I could have forgiven the wait if the food was worth it. It wasn't. When we first got our food, I was astounded at how small the sandwiches were (considering the hefty price tag). To add insult to injury, there was way more cabbage on my sandwich than there was cheese and meat. \n\nWe went several miles out of our way to try eating there and I regret it. But, even if this restaurant was right across the street, I wouldn't eat there again. And I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone. Don't believe the hype!
