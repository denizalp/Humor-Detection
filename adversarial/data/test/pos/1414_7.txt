SETTING\nLocated next to a sketchy beer distributor and looks like a haunted house on the outside...with a \"DAILY BUFFET\" banner. Looks suspect. Is this a trap? I consider myself a risk taker.\n\nEnter inside and I feel like I've been transported into a dimly lit mini mansion that has goblets (yes, really!) to hold your water. Can't forget the nice TVs with bollywood music on the screen showcasing beautiful people doing outrageous dance moves. Banquet room in the back for private parties. Pretty unique venue. \n\nFOOD\nThis is a review of the buffet. What a spread! Chickpea curry, saag, goat curry (yeah, baby!), chicken curries, sweet and sour chicken\/broccoli\/mushrooms, tandoori chicken, and the list goes on. Along with raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, these are some of my favorite things. And the garlic naan! Mmm, All India got my stomach singing the \"sound of music\". Food is always piping hot and refilled at the buffet when low. \n\nSERVICE\nTypical buffet service. Sometimes water takes a while to come around. Pay at the counter by the buffet after you finish.\n\nIMPRESSIONS\nI come here at least twice a month for a reason! $1 off the lunch buffet if you have a student ID, which comes out to $9. What a steal! I've been to some indian buffets and this has to the biggest spread and the best price. Also, drinking out of a goblet makes me feel like Lil Jon. Will I be back soon? WHAT! Will I be back soon? YEAHHHHH!!!
