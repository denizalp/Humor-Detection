I do not know where to begin with this place other than one word, disappointed. \nThis was my first apartment experience since graduating from ASU in May. From the beginning it was a nightmare. When I came to move in, they told me they did not get a chance to clean the apartment ON MY MOVE IN DAY! they said their car caught on fire...ok so I came into the place and it was disgusting. Trash everywhere...boogers on the wall. Had to wait two hours till they were done cleaning to move out in the hot summer....ok...Well whatever, I made the best of it and was ready to move forward. That day we got settled in to realize basically everything was broken. Front door was messed up, sliding door did not lock, closets would not close, light in the hallway was broken--bad wiring, kitchen drawers did not close properly....list continues. My major problem was that our gas was broken and could not be turned on, we had no hot water whatsoever...I took a cold shower for a month. My roommate came home and decided to confront Jordan and it was not pleasant. We wanted her to come do a walk through with us so she could see what poor condition the apartment was in. Of course she did not even want to come with us and sent us with maintenance. Here I am almost three months later with tons of broken things in the apartment still. It is not even worth calling them for. I am counting down these next 10 months and getting out of here as soon as I can. The landscapers always leave big parts of trees right next to my apartment door, how nice to look at....I hate it here.
