I read the other reviews about what a \"seedy\" part of town this is in. Oh brother. How sheltered are people?!\nI've lived in Phoenix since 1998. No it isn't in Scottsdale. It's central Phoenix, an older part of town.\nOver the years I've been to Dr's and other businesses that were in older buildings. \nYes its next to the QT. Wow.\nIt's in a small shopping plaza. No big deal. Just don't expect rodeo drive, folks.\n\nStaff was friendly. Here's a hint: start a conversation and be nice yourself and others follow suit. I'm outgoing so this is no issue for me. \nRead their website. Yes they specialize in Phentermine. You get a weeks worth. \nYes they go over nutrition and yes they measure your body fat and resting metabolism etc. You see a nurse practitioner who decides what dose you will start with.\n\nMy first ever visit cost me $5. Yes. $5.\nNo discounts. No groupon.\nI went in wanting the phentermine after researching it.\nI got a B-12 shot, the whole workup, nutritional advice and first week of Phentermine for $5.\nIt's for new clients- first two weeks is $5 and then after that it's $18.\nWhat a deal!!!!!\nDon't know how it will go for me, but I will update. Starting the medication tomorrow.\nThe B-12 shot alone is awesome!\nHoping to lose 30 pounds.
