I've now visited this location on multiple occasions, each of them somewhat impromptu, and each of them very surprisingly pleasant. Twisted Lizard is quickly becoming the go-to spot for myself and my coworkers. It's central to where we all live and, more importantly, it never fails us, whether we're on the hunt for good food, good drink, or just a good place to enjoy good company.\n\nDuring my first visit ever, I happened by complete stroke of luck to run into an old friend (Danika) playing an acoustic set. I had no idea that Twisted Lizard even hosted live music. Learning this was really exciting for me because I LOVE live music, and this location is walking distance from my home, making it an easy choice for a relaxing night out after a long day of work.\n\nFOOD & DRINK\n\nMonths and months ago, a coworker raved to me about how good the food was at Twisted Lizard. After eating here for the first time not long ago, I have to admit that I was, yet again, surprised by just how delicious the food was! I remember ordering the Filet Sliders - thick cuts of delicious steak filets served with grilled onions and the cheese of your choice between a warm, fresh roll. Sooooooooo good!\n\nThe fries were also exceptional. I was visiting with two coworkers at the time and, after each of them \"tried one\", it was all I could do to keep their hands off my food! It was like swatting at flies (but who could blame them, right?).\n\nThe drink options are also very acceptable. My usual go-to is scotch and, while I've seen larger drink menus elsewhere, I've never yet been disappointed with the range of options available to me here.\n\nSERVICE\n\nEvery time I've ever been to this Twisted Lizard, I have been fortunate to experience wonderful service. I've had the same bartender a few times in a row, and she is always extremely pleasant to work with - very talkative without being intrusive - humorous, engaging, helpful. Honestly, I look forward to visiting Twisted Lizard because I've only ever been made to feel at home here. And that's no small thing.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf you've yet to visit this location and you're in the area with a hankering for some delicious American food or even just a quick drink (or 5), I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. You're sure to find something delicious to eat (or drink), and I'm confident you'll appreciate the wonderful atmosphere and attention to details of service, as have I.\n\nTwisted Lizard Team - kudos to you. You work really hard at what you do and you deserve to know that it's noticed, and appreciated. Thank you for consistently helping me to feel welcomed and relaxed. Thank you, too, for the great live music, good drinks, and delicious food!  :)
