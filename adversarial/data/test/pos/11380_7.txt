This can't be! Days Inn is supposed to be cheap, mediocre, and bland for the close-to-middle-class folks.....this is WAY to pretty! I don't want to touch anything or I'll break something! Marble, granite, mahogony, what???? A super bar???? An awesome pool\/hot tub\/sauna area???\n\nOk, I have to share a story. I didn't stay here, one of my colleagues did. I wanted to go swimming so bad but my hotel didn't have a pool- hers did. So we get there- I change into my swimsuit, go all the way down to the pool---- only to find out it's CLOSED??? WTF??? Well, there WAS NO apparent sign or anything and the doors were unlocked. So what did we do? We asked ourselves \"What's the worst that could happen? They'll just ask us to get out!\" So we hopped the gate going down the stairs and I turned on the hot tub on hopped in! They had it set up like a jungle so you felt like you were outside. She just lounged in a chair while I sat in the bubbles for about 20 minutes and we BS'd. When I got out and dried off, we heard someone come in the doors. It was an old attendant guy. He yelled \"Who's there?\" We stayed quiet. \"I know you're there!\" We were trapped- the bathroom\/locker room doors were locked downstairs by the hot tub so we had to go up the stairs to where we came from- where he was. So- we nonchalantly hobbled up there- in the meantime the guy is asking us how we got in-- we said through the bathroom downstairs but it locked us out or someone locked it...then as we climbed back over the gate, he asked how come we knew to climb over it....OOPS! We just smiled and walked out and he just kept looking at us funny and told us we'll be kicked out of the hotel if that happens again. That was a blast.
