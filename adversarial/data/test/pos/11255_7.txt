As a sushi connoisseur I have a simple, golden rule: if the preparation of the meal takes longer than it would take me to find an ocean, physically capture a fish and\/or harpoon it myself...you might be a redneck.  ha HA!  See what I did just there?  I turned that into a Jeff Foxworthy reference!  So topical!  So timely!  I am a comedic genius.\n\nAnyhoo, Sushi Kai is good times.  Consistently friendly service with a HUGE smile - these people must be hopped up on goofballs or something because they're so damn happy to have you.  Nice fresh fish, quick prep - all good.  The maki isn't too ricey either - I hate it when some places roll the maki up with so much rice that it's like eating a hockey puck.  Sushi Kai doesn't make that mistake - their stuff is well-constructed, like the fantasy life with Megan Fox I have established in my imagination.\n\nBonus points for the washroom hallway cleverly hidden behind a backlit bedsheet.  I think it's a bedsheet - I don't have sheets on my bed because the orderlies think I'll kill myself - but that's a whole other kettle of fish.  GET IT?  Oh shit I did it again with the comedy.\n\nDoes this review actually help anyone really?  I can't decide.
