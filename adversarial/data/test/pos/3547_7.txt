Can't believe how rude these people are. I made the mistake of stopping here right after arriving to Vegas for a long await vacation. Well, they really put a damper on the whole thing and put me in a pissed attitude afterwards. Only reason they get an extra star is the prices are cheap (at least compared to Los Angeles)\n\nI email after seeing positive reviews, wanting to get side steps for my wife's truck. After emailing them, giving them info and the such, Elvia emails back \"what is the sub model of your truck\" no hello, no thanks for contacting us. Nothing. \n\nI email back the sub model. She responds back - they come in black or chrome, which do you want. Again, comes across as rude but I understand the issues with email personalities. \n\nI say I want black. She emails again - they are 269.95 installed plus tax and they can be here tomorrow. \n\nI say that's great and go ahead. I say I might not make it Tuesday before they close but will be in Tuesday or Wednesday. Response - I need a deposit to order the part. \n\nI locate their phone number and give them a call to place the deposit. Fine, everything is honky dory. Elvia was rude but some people are like that. \n\nI drive 260 miles from CA to vegas and get there at 4:45pm. A guy is inside and I tell him I'm there to get the steps. When I ask about installation he laughed at me and said everyone left for the day since they are closing in a few minutes. I told him I was bummed (can't tell you how many times people walk in minutes before closing and the workers have to stay to finish!) that Elvia didn't say we had to be there by 4pm to get it installed. \n\nThen Jennifer comes up and just starts snapping at me immediately. She tells me that they are booked for days. I said I spoke with Elvia and she was aware I was coming in. Jennifer then tells me that people need to give them a few days notice for install. WTF?!?!  I realize this is a horrible company and wanted to cut loses. I say I want to cancel the order. Jennifer said there is a 20% fee. I explain that they dropped the ball and I won't pay it but I am willing to come in at 8am the next morning. She says she can see me at 10am or 2:30pm because everyone wants an 8 am appt and they are fully booked with several customers. I remind her I'm on vacation and that is not going to happen. I will be there at 8am. She raises her voice and tells me I am not their only customer and she can slide me in at 10 or 2:30. \n\nAgain, I offer to cut ties and said refund the money. They bring up the restocking fee and I tell them that's fine, I will dispute it with my CC company. Visibly mad, she says fine, be here at 8am and not a minute later. \n\nWell I arrived at 7:45 am and not another customer to be found. By the time my truck was taken to the back, one customer was there. So please tell me where all of these appointment holding customers are that made it impossible for me to come in??? \n\nTook the full hour when every other installer takes 20 minutes. Oh well, they want the labor fee I guess.
