I was referred to the Ruby Finch Salon by a friend when I first got engaged to use for my wedding, and this was not a mistake to listen to. \nI initially booked Cora to do my hair and makeup for my engagement photos, and she was nothing less than amazing during my appointment. She listened to what I wanted and preferred not to do (e.g. eyeliner only on my top eyelid). She even made me laugh when I was nothing but frustrated with the outside sources, trying to help me relax. The products used were amazing, lasting all day since my photos ended up being taken about 5-6 hours later. Should be given that it covered up stress blemishes, and I didn't look like a clown, which is always a fear of mine. \nShe's been busy with other weddings, considering October is usually the tail end of wedding season, but don't be worried because she'll get back to you ASAP. The Salon's site was actually down for a bit, but had quickly been addressed. If you can't reach her on the site or by e-mail (also connected to site), then go ahead and reach out to her via their Facebook page. \nIn terms of pricing, $160 was spent for my hair and makeup service at the Salon's physical location, but that's excluding the tip I later sent to Cora via PayPal. So convenient. \nI've already made the mental notation to use Ruby Finch Salon for my wedding services. How can I not want to use Cora and\/or her associates if she was this friendly and professional?!
