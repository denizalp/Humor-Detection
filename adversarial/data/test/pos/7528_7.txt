With coupon in hand, I walked in to Lazy Dog's for lunch. We were seated in the bar area and I was surprised how packed the restaurant is after only recently opening. \n\nService was extremely attentive and is the main reason I bumped the star rating up to a three. \n\nWe started with the calamari appetizer and I order the lemons chicken pasta. The calamari was way too sweet and I didn't enjoy this dish at all. My pasta was very basic. Decent flavors, but you can't really go wrong with lemon and capers. I don't like spiral pasta, so I wish I could have requested a different noodle.\n\nService was extremely friendly and attentive.  They definitely put in extra effort since they just opened and I appreciated that. Their lunch and dinner menus aren't too exciting so if I ever did return it would probably be to give their brunch a try.
