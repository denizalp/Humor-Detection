I literally ate at this place once a week for two years. Never had any problems with the food or service. Food was always made fast and got what I ordered.\n\n Swiss Chalet's Double leg dinner can't be beat. The fries, sauce, chicken and buns are always perfect. This meal doesn't just taste amazing but it leaves you full and satisfied. Plus a great price.\n\nI would eat Swiss Chalet everyday if i could.
