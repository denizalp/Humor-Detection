We were married in San diego on 4\/1\/16. To say we had horrendous experience with this company still wouldn't cut it. Sadly, we are left with a blah wedding video and very poor quality raw footage. Once we saw the wedding video we were very upset since they didn't include ANY of our wishes and chose their own music throughout the video, although they state on their website they use all the songs played at your wedding, it couldn't be further from the truth. They included a mariachi song in ours, like WTF?!?! Their music was 100% the opposite!! The quality was bad too, it has a 90's videocamera feel to it. They outsource their videographers, so what you see on their website is not a good representation of their contractor's work or the cameras used. I originally left feedback on the wedding sites when this first happened- only to get in a feud with the owner Rebecca, what a piece of work!!! I had to send them breach of contract emails because they didn't send us our raw footage or short digital teaser video which was part of our contract. Rebecca blackmailed us and said we would not get our property until all of the feedback was erased from these wedding sites. In order to save legal lawyer fees I took the comments down and it still took over 6 months to get what we were owed from the contract. We thought they just threw our video together which is why it sucked so bad but it turns out the quality and content of our raw footage was so lame they had nothing to work with really. We thought we could have someone rework the footage to make a nice wedding video but it's just not possible. Rebecca is the worst business person I have ever had to deal with in my life, what a f#$cking NIGHTMARE. Her husband Chris is the one who actually came through for us in the end. If I had the option to post their emails and the footage on here I would!
