Tender... I tenderly write you this...\n\nI love love love the interior. The walls, the curtains, the furniture... beautiful! You can absolutely tell that Jeff, the owner, puts a lot of thought into how he wants his restaurants to look (also the owner of Verde). It's just gorgeous and I would love to have my house look like this!\n\nBeyond that, the focus is meant to be on the craft cocktail. I think it's really cool how they highlight the different bartenders with their names and signatures next to the drinks they've concocted. Making them like artists crafting a beautiful piece of work. Which, essentially they are, with delicious tasting cocktails! I ordered the Penny-Farthing both times I stopped in. The first time it was made by the Sarah herself (the creator) and it was like heaven. With Gozio amaretto, Zaya rum, lemon, orange, egg white and sparkling wine. It even came in one of those cute little cocktail glasses. The second time I got it Sarah wasn't working and I have to say, it wasn't the same. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means, just wasn't the same consistency. I also had a punch from the classic cocktail list (which is in super small print in the corner of the menu) and it was stellar! I think they're definitely on the right track...\n\nThe food. We ordered 6 plates:\n\nLobster Roll - #1 stand out. Fresh and that bun... oh lord. Freshly baked in house. Buttered to perfection!\nFluffernutter - Good. But I like the idea so much I want more! The peanut butter is made in house! I wished there was more fluff and more nutter. And I was confused why it wasn't in the dessert section? Is that just me?\nMac n' Cheese - very distinct taste. There was one specific cheese that was mixed in that made it that way that's escaping me, but I liked it. Plus, it was extra smooth and creamy, just the way I like it!\nPoke - very good, very fresh.\nHush Puppies - a tad too salty for me.\nPotato Salad - slices of red potatoes. I did like the dill vinaigrette but I'd opt for a second portion of the Lobster Roll...\n\nThe thing you have to keep in mind is that the plates are Ã¼ber small and pricey. We split all of this between 4 of us and we were all still pretty hungry after. I think I'd come here for either pre-dinner apps or after dinner dessert\/snacks. I wouldn't come here just for dinner. My wish\/hope\/dream is that they offer bigger plates. I think what they have going on is fantastic and interesting. Plus, I love the atmosphere so much that I'd love to sit down and enjoy a nice filling meal here. \n\nI will most definitely be working my way through the cocktails! And dreaming of making my house look like the inside of this joint...
