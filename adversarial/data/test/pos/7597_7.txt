I would like to thank my addiction to comic books for another addiction.. Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches.. but as the ad states clearly, they're not really Gourmet sandwiches, they're damn tasty sandwiches.. and let's leave it at that. \n\nI needed my comic book fix on a Wednesday afternoon and well, I found a shop about two stores down from this location. After getting my weekly issues, I was allured by the sign saying that the smells were free and sure enough, those smells were something i would pay for if I had to. \n\nThe sandwich prices were really cheap. Who needs some silly Subway when you have a place like this? Workers were pretty helpful and I'm glad I didn't have to deal with a Sandwich artist, as true art is very subjective on being enjoyed by all. \n\nMy first sandwich here was a Turkey Tom. Maybe I was just trying to cleanse my system from all the drinking with some healthy protein, but this sucker was delicious. While some may not like sprouts, I think they're the forgotten green. Be them a micro one.  \n\nTheir Vito was also really good. Them Italian subs, now that there is a spicy genoa salami sandwich with capicola and provolone and hot peppers! \n\nTheir house brand chips were also pretty damn tasty considering I'm not much of a chipper lover. I think I'm hooked after this first taste to sandwiches here. A shame since I'm a state away.
