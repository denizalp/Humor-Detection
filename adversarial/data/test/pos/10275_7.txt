No one is safe from the condescending bouncers.  A suit may make you look good, but doesn't give you the right to be an asshole. \nGo to this line, no go to that line...Frick...get organized!  \nIs me standing here a fire violation, really? \n\nOnce you get through the maze and the $20 cover charge, you enter the quintessential world of VEGAS. Gold boobs, table service, stripper poles, and various dance floors. It's LUSH, ELEGANT, and NOT tacky. I swear all that was missing was some candy walls and glitter from the ceiling at 1AM.  It works. It's not stuffy, and the people are a good mix of dorks, rappers, and true beat thumping dancers. \n\nYou will have eye candy and those people that just make you want to look away...yes drunk girl in the bathroom who is naked, I am talking about you.  Nonetheless, this is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.  It's entertaining and busy in a good way.  Not to be missed! \n\nDid I mention the club is SPACIOUS.   Multiple open dance areas with plenty of ventilation make the night crawlers stay out past their bed times.    In addition, there is an outdoor area to mingle. It boasts a relaxing pool, cabanas, game tables, and for the sexy-heaters.\n\n The pool is a nice touch.  If your feet start to ache, take a quick dip outside and JUST DANCE. \n\nIf you are walking to XS, pack some socks...the walk home at 5AM is going to be painful.  Tip: Get a cab!
