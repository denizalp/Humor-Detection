I had the super food salad with beets and goat cheese. It was delicious and plentiful. The pea and ham soup was flavorful, thinner than I typically like, very tasty. The owner was very attentive and gracious. I'll be back. Okay, I had dessert too. Caramel nut tarte with chocolate ganache. It was really good, not too sweet. The portions were very large, they would have easily served two.
