A must stop if you're in the Scottsdale area.  A cute little shop with an outstanding selection of hot sauces, salsas, and off the wall trinkets.\n\nExtremely friendly and helpful folks that will wrap up your purchases for plane travel.  They also have a website if you want to purchase and ship home.  \n\nA great little shop where I will continue to shop online and visit when I return to the Scottsdale area.
