First visit to this location and it was the worst experience!. Started off ok as we ordered our sushi and fried food items. The back kitchen items came out promptly but the 90% of sushi that we ordered never arrived.  45 mins past and yes.. 45 mins as there's a time stamp on all your orders on the iPad and not one sushi plate came.  Tables next to us received their items before us even when they arrived after us.  We asked two waitresses 30 mins in and because of their lack of English, they weren't much help. \"I'll check\" and they never returned.  So I asked for the manager who offered one of the AYCE meals to be covered.  I explained to him that after waiting for so long, my appetite has gone because I already ate the back kitchen items.  He then told us to just leave and don't pay.  So with that, we picked up and left only to be stopped by 3 of the waitresses demanding us to pay.  We told them the manager told us not to pay and leave.  They kept insisting that we needed to pay.  We told them to use their mics to speak to the manager to get things straightened out but they didn't.  As I was walking out, I told the manager to please communicate with his waitresses so they don't keep stressing out.  Ya, he was still pissed I guess and again, told me to leave.  At no point did I raise my voice or make a scene.  I simply tried to get the waitresses and manager to align with me but he if anything seemed more upset about the situation than I was.  In the end... It totally did suck that I went to an AYCE sushi and had no sushi :(
