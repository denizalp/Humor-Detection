When I write my novel, it will likely be titled \"The Heartbreak of Chinese Food in Pittsburgh.\" It is a mystery to me that the Burgh gets so many kinds of food so right, and most of the Chinese food is just \"meh.\" But that's where we are.\n\nWe ordered sesame chicken and General Tso's chicken. My first clue that something was off? The only difference between the appearance of the two dishes was the sesame seeds. Would you be surprised to hear they tasted the same? Would you be surprised to hear they both tasted like sweet and sour chicken? I was.\n\nOn the way in, we asked a guy leaving with his takeout order what he liked. \"It's all good!\" he said with genuine enthusiasm - I believe that because I am a little worried that every dish is pretty much the same thing, so if you like one, you'll like them all. Meanwhile, I will keep looking for really good sesame chicken. Is that too much to ask?
