Hmm.  Tough call here.\nCame in out of desperation on Canada Day weekend.  \nIt was NOT clean at all, like, not clean. I should have left when I smelled the garbage.  I should have left when I SAW the pile of garbage overflowing.  But I'm not a spoiled princess, so I decided to stick it out!  And you know what, it was fine. I mean, what do you want when you pay $30 for a mani pedi!?\n\nI have to say though, these girls actually did a really good job on my nails. The mani lasted 5 days (which for me is a really long time), and the pedi lasted 3 weeks!  It is for this reason alone that I am giving this place 3 stars.\n\nPS - it's been 5 weeks, and I still have not gotten any flesh eating disease or anything!  Sweet!
