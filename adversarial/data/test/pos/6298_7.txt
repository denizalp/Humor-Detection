We saw this place featured on the Food Network on \"Restaurant Impossible\" like many other people and figured we had to give it a shot!\n\nThe look and feel of the restaurant is nice.  Clean, cozy, warm with nice decor and more of an upscale, brunch looking place.  You would not be able to tell that from the outside.\n\nThe selection of food is a combination of traditional American and Southern comfort food.  It's nice that all entrees come with a free sweet tea.  Unfortunately, I did not realize this and got a flavored sweet tea for a little extra, which turned out too be a little too artificial tasting, but not a big deal.\n\nI naturally had to try the chicken and waffles, and it wasn't the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.  It was just OK.  My husband got a cuban sandwich though, and that was pretty tasty!\n\nWe were able to cash in on our free dessert for having checked-in using Yelp and went for the bread pudding which was VERY tasty.  I am a huge sweet tooth, so this was right up my alley.\n\nOverall, I'd come back since I frequent that area often, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.
