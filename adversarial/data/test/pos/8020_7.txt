By far the worst food experience that I have had in AZ since moving here.  They should change thier name to \"American Caserols trying to be mexican\".  GROSS.  I ordered the seafood enchalada's.  That was my first mistake.  NEVER order seafood your first time at a restaraunt!  They were made with FLOUR tortilla's and the sauce was the conistency of OOBLECK (yes, that gross stuff you made in grade school by mixing cornstarch and water together).  The \"seafood\" was immitation crab and bay shrimp. It was so disgusting that I sent it back.  The waitress couldn't have cared less that I didn't like my food.  She just said \"ok, whatever\" and took it.  You couldn't pay me to go back this this place again!
