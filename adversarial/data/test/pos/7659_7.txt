Took my little guy for an early dinner since we were headed to a movie.\n\nThe place was steady and not super busy. Ordered at the counter and had a really friendly girl take our order. Ordered a bento box, some sushi and a kids meal.\n\nSat down at a table and waited for our order to be called. A few minutes later,the sweet girl who took our order came over with a tray. Nice surprise. She also asked if it was okay to give my son a treat since he was so cute. Awe how nice. She provided him a lollipop and advised him,it was for after his dinner. He was over the moon. Lucky kid.\n\nThe sushi was fantastic and so was my bento box of noodles and beef. My son enjoyed his kids meal, a little ninja pack. Too cute. \n\nThey have two kids options called \"Little Ninja packs\". Includes small rice,beef or chicken and a juice box. Super cute and perfect for the finicky little people in your life.\n\nThe pricing is excellent, food is hot and fresh and service was amazing. Will be back.
