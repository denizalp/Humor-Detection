Not bad for a lobster fast food chain, the food was good and reasonably priced.\n\nPros\n\nService: All the staff members were friendly and prompt with getting orders out as fast as they could. \n\nPrices: Affordable prices for lobster sandwiches and tacos without having to dine in at a fancy seafood restaurant.\n\nCons\n\nMiso Sesame Roll: The miso sesame dressing was a major fail since there was no taste of miso or sesame in the dressing. The chunks of lobster meat however was prepped and cooked just right so I'll go for the original Maine style roll with just plain butter on the next visit. \n\nLemonade: The lemonade was more sugar than lemon and it wasn't as fresh as it was advertised to be.
