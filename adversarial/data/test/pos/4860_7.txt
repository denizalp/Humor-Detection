Numb is conveniently located in Caesars Palace. I stopped by for a frozen drink while exploring Caesars. The staff was down to earth and let us sample different flavors. I chose Purple Haze which was flavorful. If you want your drink strong, it's probably best to add a shot. Customers can mix up flavors. There are cheaper refills if you buy certain souvenir cups. Numb is small but has a lively atmosphere. Prices are high but it's Las Vegas.
