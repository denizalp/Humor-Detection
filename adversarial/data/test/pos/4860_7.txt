Got to Gypsy Rose at 5:00 this evening for the Friday the 13th special with a friend. Called ahead and Was told the wait time would be approximately 45 minutes, maybe sooner. After waiting 2 hours we inquired to see where they were at on the schedule and was told it would be another 2 hours. We were willing to wait, but after checking in once more we were told it would be another 2 hours, as they were still catching up on people from 3:00 this afternoon. Needless to say if their scheduling is any indication as to how the shop is run, avoid at all costs.
