For years I had longed to take on the RoethlisBurger, but Peppi's hours aren't the most convenient for me. That is until a Saturday evening at Altar Bar with Icarus Witch and Kamelot caused Kay and I to track down dinner in the Strip District. \n\nAnd there it was, Peppi's. And they were...open?\n\n\"Yeah, 'til 8PM,\" a guy behind the counter said. \n\n\"But the sign says...\"\n\n\"Oh, ignore that. What'll it be, man?\" \n\nKay was frightened of the RoethlisBurger, so when I ordered it, she ran to The Clown across the street. \n\nAfter the fellow took my order, I was given a ticket, and was told to sit down and relax. As I waited, I took in the surroundings, gazing at the sports memorabilia and photos of patrons both ordinary and famous. \n\nJust as hunger pangs assailed my belly, there it was, enveloped in a paper plate in front of me: A homonculous of loose meat a la Maid-Rite gone malevolent. Ground beef, hot sausage, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, scrambled eggs, and 'Merican cheese were all packed into a bread that was as flaxen as a Valkyrie and as airy as the morning mist. Upon doing some research I've found that it is called a Portuguese Roll, and it is pulchritudinous. \n\nThis behemoth of a breakfast sandwich dazzled my tongue with its spice, filled my stomach amply with its bulky, chunky  proteins, and soothed me with its fresh, fundamental vegetables, all of it held together with that amazing roll of rolls that threatens to make Italian bread passe via its sublime texture alone. \n\n'Tis the greatest sloppy joe to ever emerge from a steaming flattop. \n\nP.S. I found nothing \"shabby\" or \"greasy\" or \"dirty\" or \"loud\" about Peppi's. The service was friendly, the restaurant itself was clean, the atmosphere was quiet, and the sandwich was triumphant. If Primanti Brothers has a true parallel, it is Peppi's.
