I stumbled upon this bakery on my way to an appointment, and even though I was running 20 minutes late I couldn't help but be lured inside by the aroma of 10 metric tonnes of butter being churned and made into glistening pastries shortly en route to my stomach. Almond croissants, chocolate (\"pain au chocolat\"), plain and many other baked delights await here. My chocolate croissant was decidedly the best of its kind I've sampled in Toronto.\n\nI'd been warned of the unwelcoming (French) service so I knew to expect it: the two girls at the cash were more interested in talking to each other than ringing in my $2 purchase. Justin Bieber is like soooo cute, hey.
