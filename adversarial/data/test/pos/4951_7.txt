Fine pastry?  They ain't lyin'. \n\nWhile other bakeries here in Chambana are shaky on quality (the puff pastry is good, but the scones aren't, or vice-versa), Mirabelle's is consistently high-quality.  They don't have a line every time you come in for no reason.  Plus, just looking at all the fancy, dressed-up baked goods in the case is like the Pillsbury Doughboy equivalent of porn.\n\nEverything I've had has been knee-weakingingly good.  I am glad I live on the other side of town, for the sake of my thighs.
