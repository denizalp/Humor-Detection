This place is only OK because it is convenient to my\nplace, otherwise I would avoid it.\n\nThey do show the UFC card for free and they always have tables available, so that is the main draw.\n\nService is ok, food is gross, pricing average. Nothing too thrilling or unique here. Sometimes overpopulated with tourist types or drunk students.
