I haven't been to any Motley Brews events except for the Great Vegas Festival of Beer at Tivoli Village.  Although it was crowded as heck, I thought it was very well run.  The lines to get beer were not too long and there were food trucks outside, which kind of helped lower the crowds around the beer.  Some people were drinking in one area while others were eating in another.  Perfect crowd management device!  The entertainment was great.  Selection of beer was amazing. I'm looking forward to other Motley Brews events.
