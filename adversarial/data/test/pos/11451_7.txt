Two of us had lunch here with a menu selected by the chef.\n\nHere's a list of items served the two of us.\n\nChips with rustic salsa and spicy chile salsa and guacamole\nRoasted mussels and shrimp skillet.\nJalapeño queso fundido with tortillas.\nAppetizer trio sampler--tuna ceviche tostada, posole verde, and chorizo gordito.\nPatzcuaro duck relleno.\nToluca portobello mushroom.\nWild mushroom enchildas.\nSanta Rosa pork barbacoa.\nShrimp and mussels Moqueca.\nCarne asada.\nTrio of desserts--coffee flan, tres leches cake, warm chocolate brownie.\n\nMy dining mate was brought a trio of margaritas to sample in the beginning and later we each were brought a trio of aqua fresca drinks--horchata, prickly pear cactus with lemonade, and watermelon.\n\nI have rarely had a meal when I left without having some comment about something being able to be done better or spiced more or something along those lines. Everything I tasted yesterday was perfectly executed and beautifully plated. Some standouts were the posole verde. Prepared differently than I've ever seen, there was hominy, diced pork, green chile, tomatillos, Mexican oregano, shredded cabbage, and shredded red radish. What a great take on a classic soup! Another was the shrimp and mussel moquec--a Brazilian dish done here with a Mexican flair. The coconut aji amarillo sauce, looking like a curry but tasting nothing like it, gave the shrimp, rice, and mussels a great flavor. Last, the Patzcuaro duck relleno, a Michoacán dish, was superb! The duck confit was excellent. The dish is normally made with smaller poblano chiles, but Chef Willey made two larger ancho chile versions yesterday.\n\nService throughout lunch was top notch. The ingredients of every dish were explained and we were alerted when we were being served something that was spicy but there was nothing that would raise any spice alarms for me. The green salsa made with several chiles including habanero was spicy hot and I liked it.\n\nExecutive chef Willey came by several times to check on us, answer questions, and explain how some of the dishes came about. The General Manager, Annaliza McKinney, also came by to check up on us.\n\nTwo hours after being seated I left, very full and very satisfied. Every dish was really well done and I was pleased to have had the chance to try Cañonita--a restaurant that I've walked by many times and always wanted to try but somehow never did.
