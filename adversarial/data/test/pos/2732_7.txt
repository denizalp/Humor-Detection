Great place to study. I only come here on Sunday mornings, so I wouldn't know how it's like on other days, but I come here here every Sunday and it's consistently never crowded and quiet. \n\nThe usual customer base is older ladies and men. The music is soft. The employees are friendly. There's free wifi and outlets near a couple tables.
