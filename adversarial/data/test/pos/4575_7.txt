Nobody likes driving down the road and hearing or seeing that rock come flying through the air and bouncing off your glass. Then looking for a chip or if it was just a dirt mark. Sadly, this time the mark did not wipe away!\n\nQuick and seamless process here at Techna Glass for a rock chip repair in my windshield. Ariana was very helpful with getting my car fixed. I pulled in, had my window inspected, we agreed on pricing then she installed the repair resin. I went inside to pay and saw they offer window tinting, replacement glass and windshield wipers. While you wait you can partake of a hot tea or bottle of water in their comfortable waiting room. I went outside to watch the process and she was already taking off the repair tool and began cleaning the windshield.\n\nWithin 15 minutes was back on the road!
