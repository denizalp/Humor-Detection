The place was a bit hard to find. It's on the side of the building and is not visible from Leslie Street. \n\nThe food is delish. Has a very different feel and most other sushi places. Everything is a la carte and no \"freebies\" like small soups or salads they bring you before your meal at other places. \n\nTrue to their positioning as a higher-end sushi place, the bill is probably going to be a tad heavier on your wallet than you anticipate. However, the food shouldn't disappoint you so in the end it's going to be worthwhile.
