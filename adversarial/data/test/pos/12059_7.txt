LOCATION!! LOCATION!! ‍‍\n\nThis place is awesome!!! I love getting my swing on here! The location is perfect! Right across the freeway from Westgate Entertainment District. \n\nThis location is laid out somewhat differently then there north Scottsdale location, but it's nicely put together. \n\nI really like the huge jumbo tron screen they have inside by the bar, as well as the two they have out side at the back of the venue, what a great idea! I bet this place would be awesome to watch football games. \n\nSpeaking of watching tv. Each bay has it own tv that you can control which channel you desire. There's more... they have the NFL Sunday Ticket! HECK YEAH!!! \n\nThe staff here are super friendly and very professional. Everyone seemed in very great spirits and acted as if they loved their jobs. So cool to see that. I noticed the staff wore a lot of different colored polos... I am not sure what each color means? Maybe perhaps it's associated with their job title or duties? Next time I visit I'll have to ask that question to find out. \n\nThe food here is so good! A little on the pricey side but very very delicious. We ordered the chicken nachos with the trio hot wings. I definitely recommend the hot wings and the nachos here. They were bomb dot com! Haha As far as options on the menu, they have quite a bit to choose from, which it really awesome to see! I love a wide variety on a food menu. \n\nWe can in the middle of the afternoon while it was still hot out. They did provide mister fans to help keep you cool in the bay, but I would suggest visiting this place either earlier in the day or later in the evening when it's cooler out. Especially in the hot summer months. \n\nWe are have a platinum membership, I strongly suggest getting this membership, for a few reasons... First, I noticed you get treated like royalty just for having the platinum membership. Second, you don't have to wait in line for a bay! I'll repeat... YOU GET TO SKIP THE WAIT LINE TO GET A BAY! Third, they provide you with the second level preference and you'll always be assigned a bay in the middle of the venue. Fourth, they bring out the \"GOOD CLUBS\" they provide you with awesome high end Calloway golf clubs. \n\nThe platinum membership is the way to go folks!! \n\nOverall our experience here was awesome, and we will definitely be back again very soon!
