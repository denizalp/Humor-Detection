My first visit to a Pei Wei and I was so impressed.  This Pei Wei is in the Las Vegas airport.  The line was long, the dining space was cramped and the service was slow...as with all airport restaurants that are worth eating at.  I ordered a cup of Thai Wonton Soup & a bow of Edamame, $9.  Overpriced but generous portions by airport standards.  It was ALL delish!  The wonton soup was just perfect. Pei Wei is definitely on the radar.
