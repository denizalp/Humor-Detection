Cave Dwellers has a drop box in my office building, which makes their service incredibly convenient. If it's in by 9:00, it's delivered the next day at no extra charge. I have been working from home more often lately, so I drop off at their storefront in the Ayrsley Plaza (South Tryon and I-485 near Wild Wings).\n\nThey do a bang-up job and I have not had a single complaint. I brought them a leather jacket last year and they managed to clean out some dirt stains. A pant cuff repair took a week but it looks great.\n\nIt's a little pricey - $2.50 a shirt - but well worth it.\n\nI hadn't needed cleaning in at least two months, so I walked in last week with over a dozen shirts and five pants. When I gave the counter-girl my last name, she knew my first name and said that I was usually a delivery customer. Amazing service. I was very impressed!
