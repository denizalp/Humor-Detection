This has been on my radar for a few weeks and we went here for dinner tonight.  Walking into the restaurant is a treat.  It is so well decorated with New Mexican, Southwestern and chile items that it's very pleasant.\n\nWe were soon greeted by Amy who showed us to our table and was our server.  After looking over the menu, we ordered a burrito for my wife with refried beans and Spanish rice and I got a chimichanga filled with carne adovada.  My two sides were pinto beans and calabacitas.  I ordered red sauce--regular spice level--for my wife and I got the triple hot green sauce for my chimichanga.  \n\nWe were brought a basket of chips and some salsa that had a good kick to it.  Even my gringa wife is starting to like spicier foods.  Win!\n\nOur dinners came and they were very good.  Andrea thought her red sauce was spicy but she liked it.  My triple hot green sauce was great and it added great flavor to the adovada.  The only minor drawback was we were brought no sopapillas despite the menu saying that all meals are served with sopapillas and two sides.  As it turned out, we were full enough without having the extra amount of food from the sopapillas.\n\nFor dessert, we got an order of fried ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  Very good and large enough for sharing.\n\nPrices are very reasonable and for some reason we had a $4.35 credit applied to our bill listed as a coupon.  We didn't have a coupon.  Our server, Amy, was a verry pleasant person.  She made you feel welcome.\n\nI wish the menu offered a bit more choices but I will be back to try the stacked enchiladas.
