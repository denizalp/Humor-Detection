Alright, they're still the most legit Thai in town. I know everyone loves to throw around how much they're a Thai \"expert\" but I lived near Thai Town LA for most of my life and this is the kind of food preparation I grew to have a taste for.  For those who don't know Los Angeles has the largest Thai population outside of Thailand and food has to be amazing because your customers are mostly Thai immigrants. \n\nWe had Thai Ice Tea ($2.50) and I have to note that theirs isn't too sweet which is nice. \n\nGreen curry w\/ tofu ($7.99)- the tofu used was silken and lightly fried to give some texture and they added peas, bellpepper, bamboo shoot and green beans which was a welcomed addition. The curry itself was very good and I appreciate that it's not so sweet which a lot of Thai places tend to do for the American palette. Sweetened green curry is good, regular savory green is delicious! We ordered this a 2, and it came more like a 5-6....maybe a note to do \"no spice\" for the BF and add my own because it's a bit much for him to be able to eat. Even with the spice, the BF says this is his new favorite curry (he loves panang and always orders it). \n\nLone some Trout ($9.99 for filet or you can get a whole fish for $12.99) Filet comes out in bigger chunks than the previous owners version. It makes it less crispy, but it still is good. I appreciate this is still around and will order again.\n\nMoo-Tod\/Garlic Pepper Fried Pork ($8.99)- This is for the salt and pepper porkchop people and garlic fanatics out there! It's basically a  pork chop battered then rolled in pieces of garlic and served with a duo sauce (meant to mix) of a plum kinda hoisin like sauce and a lemon spice sauce. I kinda had a garlic love moment which the BF laughed at.  Will order this again because I'm a garlic\/salad\/pork lover; this was a dish meant for me. I had it once before on top of a noodle dish and I've been thinking about that damn pork for years. People who think Anthony Bourdain is the biggest pork whore hasn't met me. I will note though that next day that the garlic will linger. I took a shower and brushed my teeth well yet I still feel like I'm slightly garlicky so it's no joke.\n\nThe BF and I came starving which never is a good idea because we will order with our eyes and empty bellies and not our head. Prices are reasonable for the very fair portions of food.  Lots to take home to gorge on later! \n\nLotus of Siam is noted for being the most \"exotic\" Thai menu around with their Northern dishes....Thai Grill has Northern and like 4 other regions giving Lotus for a run! This is a diamond find for me. I'll keep coming back to try out everything and join Dan P. in his symphony of Thai Grill chants whenever Thai food conversations pop up on Yelp. \n\nHowever, there are still some hangups that I found odd during our dinner. The owner checked on the table next to us like 20 times, chatted with them about the dishes, etc and never did check our table since we had a server. The lady taking care of us didn't really give as personal service. Just saying, it's an observation that theres a big difference in experiences from one table to another. Our server came out that they don't have Lonesome Trout filet and if we want the whole fish after we already had eaten half of two dishes and been there a while. I didn't want a whole because I was hoping for smaller crispier filets so I asked if I can order something else and get the filets on a next visit. Not even a few minutes later, she said that they were making lonesome filet and brought it out. It was just odd. \n\nYelpers- expect a February Sunday dinner UYE to pop up real soon! I think the spot offers quality food though so I'd like to explore more of it and hope for a bit better service.
