I used to take the 51 to see my wife, who lived on the NE side of town.  Now married and a NE Phoenix resident, I've learned a thing or two from this wonderful freeway.\n\nThe views are outstanding.  Driving south, you're greeted with a wide and long view of the Phoenix landscape, from Downtown to South Mountain.  Beautiful.  Driving north, you'll enter a stretch of freeway that is sandwiched right in the middle of the Phoenix Mountain Reserve.  Beautiful.\n\nTraffic on the 51 is a myth.  For years, I heard horror stories from my now father-in-law who commutes on this freeway daily.  When I moved to my current hood, I expected my trek to Downtown Tempe to be unbearable.  For months, I just drove surface streets.  In an especially ambitious mood one morning, I decided to hop on the 51.  I've never looked back.  On a bad day, I'll experience very light slowing at Bethany Home Rd, but most of the time the coast is clear.  And this is at 8 in the morning!\n\nI feel weird being so passionate about a freeway.
