-PARKING: plenty\n\n-DECOR: what is with the BRIGHT fluorescent lights during dinner? Most places have softer lighting during dinner. Plus, it smelled like dirty carpets and felt like some kind of church hall meeting with the strange lighting.\n\n-RESTROOM: Smelled like sewage and needed to be cleaned, like someone just had a toilet paper party in the ladies restroom.\n\n-SERVICE: all of the employees that I encountered were friendly.\n\n-PRICE: Not too bad for dinner, like $10 bucks and change.\n\n-FOOD: Pretty good. The Chinese was not good, but all of the American \"comfort\" foods were pretty tasty. Decent selection.\n\n-BEVERAGE: They give you your beverage when you pay and the waitress gives you refills. No access to coffee or your own refills. Reminds me of the Vegas buffets where you are at the mercy of the Food Server for refills.\n\n****Four Stars for good food and friendly service.
