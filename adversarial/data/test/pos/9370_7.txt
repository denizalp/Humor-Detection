Oh no......my ice maker is on the fritz.....no ice. I google appliance repair in Vegas because my old go-to company have disappeared. Sears? Household name.....you can book online. Sounds good right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThe guy arrives after a phone call to verify what type of ice maker , freestanding or in the fridge. Good guy , clean , polite and capable. On the website they say $70  for estimate. \n\nThe guy identifies a bad pump, this is where you have to trust your guy. New pump or can you clean out\/fix the old one. What do you think he said? \n\nObvious . \n\n\"New pump and I've got it on the van\" \n\n\" what a surprise!\" .\n\nHe then logs into his laptop \" $506\" says the guy.  \n\n WTF? \n\nThe pump is $225 plus labor, tax etc!!!!!\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nSo if you want to be completely ripped off by a company, Sears are highly recommended, this is not a dig at the repair guy, he just works for these clowns. The job was quickly completed and I now have ice but my goodness, I think I could have flown to the Arctic circle with a cooler, chipped some ice out of a glacier and flown home for less money. BEWARE.
