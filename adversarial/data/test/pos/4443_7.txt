This review is for Tierney. \n(I hope that's right. It's what my receipt says.)\nI don't usually single out servers, but she was so incredible (as was the awesome hostess on Monday night) that I feel like I need to mention her by name. \n\nOur group of yelpy trivia players this past Monday grew from 4 to 5 to 7 to 9 to 12 over the course of an hour or so, and each time we needed to add more seats and swap people about, she knew exactly where people were and what they ordered. With each arrival she brought a menu, ran through the food specials time and time again (poor thing... it's fries and wings y'all... half off... every Monday... now you know) and made sure that pints were full of Yelp's Bursting Red Ale and that we felt tended to. \n\nTipsy Trivia is one of my favorites in town, simply because almost everyone who's there on Monday plays. I have to imagine the servers aren't as excited about it as I am. Cheap fries, cheap wings, growing party sizes... it's probably a server nightmare. But ours was a breath of fresh air and for pub grub and beer, it was probably some of the best service I've received in Madison. \n\nAs for the food, it's what you'd expect. I've always felt the burgers are a little over cooked, but you can stack 'em high, so that's a plus. Parmesan wings were a touch overwhelming, but the standard and the Asian glazed made mouths happy. And rotating taps keep things interesting, and it was exciting to see some \"locals\" (midwest but not Madison) that I had never heard of.
