Where to begin, well let's start with the Crab cakes and fried Calamari!\nBoth were excellent choices.  Fresh and oh so good.\nI loved this place as Fish market. It was one of my favorite places to go.\nSo now as Bluewater Grill they have made it even better.\n\nThe appetizers were really good. The fish was firm and fresh, always a good sign. The fish tacos were blackend and really tasty. \nT got the Clam Chowder never a good thing for me. But, she thought it was great!\nThe Oysters were really great as well.\nGreat service, nice clean bathrooms.\n\nThey were not taking any coupons from some special they had recently.\nBut, we did not have any anyway.\nPlus there is a Birthday club you can sign up for on line. I have not done that yet.\nBut, I will.
