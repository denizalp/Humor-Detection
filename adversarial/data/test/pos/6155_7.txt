I bought the Revere mattress after the recommendation from a friend. I have to admit, it seemed a little firmer than I had originally expected. It took some time to get used to sleeping on a memory foam bed, but I am so glad I made the switch. I used to wake up with back and neck pains, but now I wake up feeling great. The transaction went smoothly, and the sales-girl gave me two memory foam pillows at discounted price. Delivery was on time. I bought a king size and the mattress is heavy, but overall the set up was very easy. I would recommend these mattresses.
