Verrrrry large Asian grocery store. Here you'll find anything you need to cook Asian dishes. You've got all the basic condiments and my favorite wide selection of instant ramen, Even mama ramen! (Mama ramen is the best) Fruits are not too fresh, and I wouldn't buy meat from there. But vegetables....it is vegetable heaven. Fresh spinach (not in package), mint leaves, pandan leaves, 99 cent avocados. There are the usual Asian snacks too like rice crackers, cookies etc. \n\nWould recommend this place if you live in St. Laurent. It is large and you can expect to spend 30-45 minutes if you do not have a grocery list with you. Service is quite nice...I don't expect service from grocery stores. But one man decided to give us a box to put all our groceries in. Definitely more efficient and eco friendly. Anyway check it out for yourself!
