I have become a Cafe Rio addict after years of passing and ignoring I finally tried it.\n\nI love this particular location which is Amazing as I have been to both Sahara locations and had horrible experiences.\n\nThey are fresh, delicious, filling and reasonable.\n\nThey have great options, burritos, quesadillas, tacos, tostadas, and taco salad. They also have a standard daily special with a non menu item.\n\nI tried the coconut shrimp taco special on Tuesday, mmmm yum yes delicious!\n\nThe burritos are HUGE and is really two meals!\n\nThe staff is super friendly at this location and I am devoted to this location only!\n\nThey have Amazing desserts! I really enjoy the keylime tart and tres leches strawberry cake it is so good.\n\nIf you complete the survey on your receipt than dessert is FREE on your next visit.\n\nWe have eaten here so many times that the staff recognizes us and is always sweet and welcoming.\n\nThis group of staff is super fun and nice, they are the Super Stars getting all of us hungry customers through the line.\n\nThe process is easy, decide on what you want, burrito, tacos, enchiladas etc. Then you pick a meat, chicken, asada, sweet pork, salmon etc. They build it for you as you like it, rice, beans, etc.\n\nWe are on the late freight in trying Cafe Rio, we had been missing out this whole time!\n\nThe food is delicious and is generous for a good price. You won't leave here hungry!
