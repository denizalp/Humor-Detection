Running around Vegas gave us the late night munchies. We were so happy that this spot  was open late!  \n\nI drowsily shuffled myself into the brightly lit and chipper restaurant. I was hungry! The menu was very simple. It focuses on the homemade curry sauce and the katsu. For the small amount of food on the plate, the prices were kind of high. We ordered the pork katsu and curry and added a side of veggies to make the plate more substantial. Bummer that there isn't a veggie and meat combo curry because adding the veggie side really bumped up the price of our dish. I'm used to Chinatown prices where you can get a substantial meal for $12. This was more of a snack for that price. \n\nMy favorite part of the visit were the delicious bright pink, free pickles that sat on the table. The jar was full when our party of 3 arrived but when we left it was only 1\/4 full. Noms.
