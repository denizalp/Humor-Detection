Flip N Out Xtreme\n\nFlip N Out Extreme is a great place for a kid to be a kid. It's great for adults too. I was here with a bunch of co-workers. Objective was to team build, have fun, and forget about work. And since we are all at least 40 years of age, another objective was for everyone to leave in one piece. All objectives met!  \n\nFlip N Out is cool and I wish places like this existed when I was a kid. Heck, it would have been cool if they had places like this when my daughter was a kid. Flip N Out is an indoor trampoline park with rock climbing and laser tag. We skipped anything related to bouncing, jumping, climbing and flipping.  Our only safe option for us was laser tag.   Our laser tag instructor did a great job powering on the 5-minute instructional video and letting us know when it was time to play.  After the video, we were separated into teams and the game was on.  I had a fun time laser tagging anyone in my way, including my own teammates.  Each game lasted 15 minutes and of course, my team won. Most importantly, we had a lot of fun and left in one piece.  Overall, it's hard not to be a fan of Flip N Out Xtreme.
