If you're spending $15 for a  Coke & Rum during the day, you're not doing Vegas right. If you're spending $15 and are completely hammered afterwards, you probably just went to Fat Tuesday.\n\nFor me, no Vegas trip is complete without coming here. There's no better way to keep your buzz going throughout the day than drinking a yard dog full of fruity goodness laced with some strong ass liquor. Beware, these babies sneak up on you, and when you realize it, it's too late to stop. \n\nLast time I got some Pimp Juice, which is a mix of a Hurricane and mango. Flavor wise, it was pretty good and had a very distinct taste compared to the rest. Apparently I missed out on the 190 Octane + 2 Everclear shots memo, but it's never too late to try it.\n\nFat Tuesday always provides just the right combination of pure belligerency, flavor, and price that you can't beat anywhere on the strip.
