After living there I can say that it was the worst place I've ever lived. Shortly after signing a new lease it was one problem after another. First the gate to the under ground parking is loud and vibrates thought the ventilation to the point where if you are in a corner condo in building 4 you will never have any peace or quiet. Second it is impossible to keep out the massive amounts of dust. Third the matianance crew is awful!  They are rude and Jose the chief engineer even attempted to get violent. I had witnesses and informed the property management of this but nothing was done. \nThis place is advertised as safe and quiet but it is not. I could hear all of my neighbors conversations through the heating systems. If you choose to rent here just know that as soon as you sign your lease that is the last time you will be treated like a human being. Moving out was the happiest day in a while.
