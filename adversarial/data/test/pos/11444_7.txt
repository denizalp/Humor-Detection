I absolutely love this place. They always take such good care of me. I highly recommend making an appointment, although this location has a lot going on to keep you busy while you wait. \n\nI love the complimentary tire repair program. I recently bent my wheel and needed to replace it & the tire. Unfortunately, they couldn't get the exact same wheel, but whatever. It is what it is. A new wheel and a new tire for about $100. Not too shabby. Customer service is always on point. I was running late to pick my car up, but they assured me it was no problem.
