I really should stop watching Food Network's \"Cupcake Wars\" on DVR while I'm running on the treadmill...  After many weeks of craving cupcakes, I finally relented and made a quick stop at AJ's to see if the boulangerie had cupcakes for sale.  I found a few cupcakes from Tammie Coe's and My Dad's Favorite (the clerk's fave out of the two) bakeries.  Out of the two, only MDF was available for purchase by the mini-cupcake ($1.50)-- TC's came in half-dozen or dozen batches.  (MDF also came in singular regular-sized cupcake packs for $4 each.)  I was jonesing for varied flavors, such as those I'd seen in Cupcake Wars, but all I had to choose from were chocolate minis w\/ coconut-flaked frosting, or vanilla minis w\/ multi-colored and glitter-dusted vanilla frostings (so uninspired), so I chose the coconut.  I should've let the mini cupcake sit out to warm up to temperature for awhile, bec. the frosting was so hard when I took a bite :(  The cake itself was OK, and I liked the bit of frosting that had coconut flakes in it, but all I could taste in the frosting was butter- yech!  Oh, but wait!  I didn't just try the cupcake here... oh no.  My attention was drawn to the salted caramel and BACON brownie when the woman ahead of me chose it for herself (along w\/ a slice of key lime pie and a carrot cake).  May I sample the brownie, please?  Oh, yes?  Why, thank you!  I really shouldn't have asked for the sample, bec. I loved it so much, I bought a whole piece ($2.99).  Why do I torture myself like this?  I really don't enjoy working out on the treadmill!  No, that's not wholly true-- I don't like the first 15 mins.  But still!  I don't need to splurge on a brownie, much less one that is frosted w\/ a chocolate ganache, salted caramel, AND crumbled bacon pieces!  \n\nNext time you're craving for something savory AND sweet, try the salted caramel and bacon brownie and thank me later.\n\np.s.  The German chocolate brownie is good, too :D\n\nMusic accompaniment: Crowded House, Together Alone.
