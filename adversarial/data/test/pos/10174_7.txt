Way to over priced for basic nails there prices are ridiculous they charge 10 more for them being \"long\" and at the end my nails ended up being short then another 10 because I wanted them coffin shape lol ended up paying 60 for basic coffin nails that ended up being short  \n\nYes you did let me know and I did agree my problems is that after I agreed to pay extra for length she ended up cutting them short tbh I have payed way more then 60 bucks for my nails and Idc about spending that much cause I can and I deserve it but spending 60 bucks yesterday on those nails makes me upset because I didn't get what I wanted and over payed on basic nails that I typically would pay 30 for and actually be the length and shaped right!!! Some are longer then the other the shape is way too narrow and I let the lady know I didn't want them that way and she still went on and did it so much for making your clients fell pampered! Hah
