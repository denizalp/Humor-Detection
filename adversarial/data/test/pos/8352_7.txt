Don't stay here. Not worth it. We just checked out of here and I'm leaving very displeased. We got this room as one those \"mystery\" high star hotels so I thought it'd be really cushy and luxe. It was not. There is nothing luxurious about this \"hotel\". Plus we had to pay a $75 resort fee for the three nights for things we didn't even use. \n\nThere was a hair in the sink when we walked in. I called to move rooms because the beds are SO LOUD and when we checked a different room it was just as loud. I couldn't even move in it without it creaking to high heaven. They said their frames are just like that. The housekeeping were yelling conversations down the entire hallway. \n\nTheir pool was heated and colorful but so are a lot of hotels in the area. \n\nWe paid a lot of money for something we could have gotten at any old motel. It's close to old town Scottsdale but that place is really dated as well. Lots of \"cowboy and Indian\" themes. As a native person, I don't find that kind of thing stylish.
