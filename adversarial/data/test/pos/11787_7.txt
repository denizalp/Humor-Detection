We recently bought a foreclosure that had some serious issues with the paint, and stucco on the exterior of the home. Leo at A&T came out to give us a free estimate same day we called. He was about half the price of some of the other estimates we received, and had references with several photos of his past work so my wife, and I felt very comfortable.\n\nLeo gave us a price, and a time line of how long it would take. We have a large 2 story home, and he replaced the stucco with a sand finish, and repainted the entire house in 4 days. They were very professional, and the job looked better than we could have imagined. They came early, stayed late, and had the job done in the time frame that was quoted. He has 15 years experiance, and it shows!\n\nIf you need any service done to the exterior of your home I would recommend talking to Leo at A&T Remodeling. Very reasonably priced, and the work is fantastic!!!
