Unfortunately, this place had a few things that made it an awful dining experience.   There were flies that were incessantly landing at our table, on nearby plates, and reminded me of the joke: \"Waiter, what's this fly doing in my soup?\"  Answer: the backstroke.  So during much of dinner, I was swinging my arms back and forth.  We ordered an order of long-neck clams ($18 seems a bit expensive), seafood tofu hotpot, and on choy with garlic.  The next problem was finding bits of plastic in the seafood hotpot meaning that the frozen seafood was cut out of a packet carelessly.  Lucky me.  Wanna be lucky yourself?  Avoid this place.
