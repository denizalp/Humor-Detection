When you can smell the BBQ from down the street...\n\nThe location is a bit unusual as it's in a residential neighborhood but you can't miss this place because the aromas will lead you there.\n\nThings to note ~ \n\nOnly outdoor seating\nDon't skip on the beans (the best I've ever had)\nLines can get long because this place is popular\nStore & butcher shop on property\n\nThe service was extremely friendly and they were kind enough to let us sample some of their sides because I had a hard time deciding what to get. \n\nWe loved the beans, mac & cheese, corn bread, pulled pork and potato salad. The pulled chicken was a little too heavy on the sauce and the ribs weren't as tender as we like. \n\nWe'll be back to sample some of the other offerings for sure! \n\nIt's a fun experience because you eat outside at a picnic table and you get to smell what's cooking from start to finish.
