Cute cute cute! This place is pretty awesome. \n\nWent straight to the bar for Happy Hour(HH is from 4pm-6pm). Unfortunately there really wasn't anything too good on the HH menu so I just ordered from the regular menu.\n\nMe and my friend got the Lunch Box which comes with half sandwich with either soup or salad. I got the roast beef sandwich with Caesar salad. The salad was the best Caesar salad I ever had in my entire life. I do not know what they put in that salad but I had to refrain from licking the bowl! It also came with dessert which was a chocolate cookie with milk which was the perfect completion to our meal. I wish I had another cookie! the roast beef sandwich was pretty good as well. It had a ton of meat and the bread was toasted perfectly. Also came with potato chips. \n\nI had questions about the wines and the bartender let me sample it before i bought it. That was appreciated. My friend settled with the pear cider which tasted like juice! Yum. \n\nMenu is pretty condensed. Not much on the menu but it looked promising. \n\nOverall, it was a great meal. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was good.
