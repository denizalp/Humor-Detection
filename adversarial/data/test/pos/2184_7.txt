Ho. Lee. Shit! Is this place ever overpriced. Just grabbing a few stocking stuffers, I picked out a spatula, a whisk and a pair of salt and pepper shakers. The price? Over $200. Who would pay $50 for a plastic WHISK? Or a SPATULA? We all know they were both made by a 6-year-old in China for a nickel. There's pricey, and then there's insulting your intelligence gimme your goddam money gouging. I was expecting it to be less than fifty bucks for all the items together. I had to just awkwardly leave all the items on the counter and walk out. Stay away, this egg is rotten.
