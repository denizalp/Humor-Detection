Very nice and helpful staff, and good poke. My one big challenge with the spot was that if I'm paying $15+ for a fish lunch I don't want to eat it with a plastic fork .  Would be great if they added some actual silverware as an option. But for sure give it a try for a nice, fresh alternative to typical lunch fare.
