WOAH. Union South got an Oprah style makeover! This place is a far cry from the dingy bowling alley\/Wisc card location of the past. \n\nThe new Union South boasts a handful of hotel rooms, comfortable lounging spaces, various restaurants and eateries, a rock climbing wall and a brand-spankin' new bowling alley. Additionally, the space is beautifully set up and very tech savvy throughout. I.was.blown.away.\n\nWhether you're a student, alumni or just someone who is looking to check out a great tailgate, you should certainly stop at Union South.
