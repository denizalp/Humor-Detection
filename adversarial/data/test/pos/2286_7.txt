Another goofy concept to bring indecisive healthy (maybe) eaters together and offer them any type of food they want while executing horribly.   I've read the critics reviews and yes this place needs a lot of refinement. \n\nLet's start with the entrance..where is it?  There are two and if you take the one nearest the Mercedes dealership you are brought directly to the food pickup and expediting area and need to take a sharp right to fight those that are coming downstream after ordering and wrap around tables  to get in line. If you take the other door and it's busy you may be in line out the door. \n\nWasn't that busy when I ate but here is the next set of issues...  the entrance and ordering linehas a wall on one side and a sort of wooden frame wall you go between to the register. There are no menus to peruse as you follow the path and all you can see are those in front of you, bits of big screens containing the menu and three large indistrialesque ikea style dome lights that block the top half of the menus.  So you'll want to read the long...very long menu before you get to the register but can't. You'll find yourself craning your neck forward and trying not to creepily bump into or smell the person in front of you while doing it.  You'll see that the only time you can see the entire menu is when you are really next in line or up to order. By that time you still need to take in the salads, sandwiches, pizza, soup, plate and other options while people breathe down your neck the same as you just did. Simple solution, put some menus on the wall of the line and change the light domes blocking the view.  But since they haven't you'll be pressured with \"next please\" before you've even seen the entire menu. \n\nThere are tons of options once you order.  Drinks below you, fountains drinks, cookies above the drinks, etc.  there is no tipping on the check but a separate tipping machine and CC transaction if you wish to give one.  Then you are given a buzzer and ushered off to your left to go around the salad making station. Where you wait in the hallway I mentioned earlier (other entrance) to get buzzed if you aren't at a table waiting.  \n\nWhile you wait, go next to the bathrooms for your drink. Ok it's a few feet away but now you know where the bathrooms are. The drink station is filled with non-Pepsi\/coke options, two teas and coffee.  \n\nNow onto the food.  I ordered a Merida chicken salad.  Looked good on the menu.  As I awaited the buzzer I watched them make the salad.  The station is set up buffet style. A worker pulls the components from bins and mixes them. With dressing (3 levels) or without and another person meticulously slices precooked protein. I say meticulously because it is measured perfectly to the ounce or maybe portion of an ounce. I watched as the preparer sliced chicken breast and placed on a scale picking up and removing and recutting until the scale said exactly what it called for..not an ounce too much that is for sure.  Avocado was added by scooping out a half and plopping it on the side of the salad plate. I'm happy to get a half avocado but how about a few slices??\n\nNow let's throw a slice of lime on top to finish it off!\n\nI was told to be careful with the tray as the plates slide all over. And boy do they.  So be careful. \n\nNow to the final product...\n\nThe salad looked underwhelming but open mind was kept until I started into it.  Although I could see that it was dressed, it had no flavor. Add your siracha or ask for heavy or more dressing.  Although I believe the menu said tortilla strips don't be surprised if you get full on chips.  That's what I got. I though this was a salad and not lettuce nachos.  They are everywhere so as you try and scoop up some salad with your fork be warned. Keep the balance or a big chip may slide off and be in your lap.  And then as you eat they soak up the remaining dressing and get soggy. Not yum.  \n\nThe chicken wast flavored ok but super dry and the avocado was laden with dark spots.  As a Mediterranean connoisseur I appreciate feta. This may be the cheapest feta I've ever tasted. More spongy than crumbly and tasting more like mozzarella than feta. \n\nSo to conclude, this place needs a whole overhaul already. Perhaps the pizza or sandwiches are good yet overcooked and flavorless food will never be a bright spot in anyone's desires (unless society has fallen that much). If you get past the layout and the food it has a bright spot, when the weather is great you can sit outside, listen to music and look at the Mercedes dealership hoping to forget the disappointment you just spent $15 on.
