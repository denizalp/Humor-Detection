I like this place... I REALLY REALLY like this place!    I've been coming here for 17 years or so. \n\nI think they do a great job on my car-- I've NEVER had a problem.   \n\nI love the convenience store and I absolutely love the little creeks\/streams\/ponds that they have along the walkways... I just love being there!  \n\nThe only thing that would have pushed them to a 5 star??   I think the guys with the clipboards - who ask you which service you want, are arrogant jerks.   They take their sweet time coming up to the vehicle and when they do, they act like you're wasting their time.   In fact, I was there last week and they were chomping down on chicken wings, yes, chicken wings.    The guy who bothered to break away from the wolf-pack didn't even look at me.   \n\nAfter you get past those Bozo's, it's a nice, pleasant experience.
