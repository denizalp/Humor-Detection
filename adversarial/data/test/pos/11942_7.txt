Overpriced is the first word that comes to mind.  And the word that dominates my feelings toward this place.  They never mentioned that the \"KING\" in the name actually  means you have to be as RICH as a REAL KING to afford to eat here.\n\n$13.95 for a ( relatively forgettable ) simple oyster Po' Boy with 5 oysters on it and a side of fries?  \nYep.\n\nWho's dumber - me for paying it, or them for charging it?  I think Me.  When I saw the price, I should have just closed the menu and left.\n\nI also had a $6.95 \"Cajun Bloody Mary\" which had nothing Cajun about it, as far as I could tell.\n\nIt was mostly ice, served in a 16-oz glass.  So maybe about 6 ounces of \"drink material\" inside.  It lasted about as long as it took me to take 5 drinks out of it.\n\nLet's do the math:  At $6.95, with 6 ounces of substance, that comes to $148.26 per gallon.  \n\nSo at least I can say I had a Bloody Mary which came in at around $148 a gallon.\n\nI will never, EVER go back to that place.  And if you do go, bring the credit card with the highest available balance, because you are gonna need it.\n\nP.S.  A manager attempted to contact me after seeing this review, trying to make things right for me.  I understand their prices reflect the \"going rate\" for fresh seafood in the desert.  I've upped the star from 1 to 2 to reflect the respect for management for trying to contact me and make things right.  Kudos for that.\n\nP.S.P.S.  I had Pete's Fish and Chips the other day, and I realized that their fried oysters are the EXACT SAME ONES which are served at King's Fish House.  So if you want to know what these fried oysters taste like, eat at Pete's.  You can get about 15 oysters there for the King's price.
