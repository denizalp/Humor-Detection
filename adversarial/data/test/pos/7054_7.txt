Sorry, SushiSamba, but what happens in Vegas, certainly does not stay in Vegas.\n\nI was recently on a business trip to the Sin City and ate at SushiSamba three separate occasions. The first two were great experiences, but sadly third time wasn't a charm. It completely ruined my entire experience.\n\nWhile the sushi was good (certainly not the best I've ever had) I was appalled when my co-worker found a hair in his roll during my third meal there. As soon as he did, we notified our waitress and her reply was \"can I get you another roll?\" so he ordered a new one. Then she asks, \"is it blonde? Because if it is, it may have been mine but don't worry I showered this morning.\"\n\nYelpers, I kid you not.\n\nOH GEE THANKS! Now I can rest assured knowing your dead skin cells that are possibly floating around my stomach were at least CLEAN.\n\nI about died - but instead stuck to eating coconut rice (I didn't dare touch a roll). A few minutes later..... another hair.\n\nThis time I stormed up and demanded the manager who questioned us the entire time and seemed entirely unconvinced that there was any hair in either of the rolls. I am sorry, but when a customer is SHOWING YOU a hair in their food, you should probably not question it. She then says, \"I just have to check because sometimes it isn't hair. Sometimes it is just small shards of chopsticks that look like blonde hair.\"\n\nAre you kidding me? So now, I should be happy with the fact that it might not be the waitress' CLEAN blonde hair, but instead a shard of chopstick that could pierce my esophagus?\n\nI have never experienced a more ridiculous restaurant situation in my life. Needless to say I left with the worst impression of the entire restaurant, which is a pity considering the first two occasions went well. Good luck to whoever dines at this place - but don't worry, at least the hair in your sushi roll is probably clean.
