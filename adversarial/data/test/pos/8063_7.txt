Came here on my 1st girls' trip to Vegas and absolutely loved it! Encore Beach Club was everything I hoped for in a beach club experience! Came here to see David Guetta who, like the primadonna he is, did not show up until 3pm and then pretended to mix his music on stage. \n\nThe bouncers and ticket collectors here were impressive. Professional, courteous and efficient despite the massive amount of people here. Lines moved very quickly everywhere. I'm really impressed with the beautiful bartenders here. The girls were constantly smiling, moved the lines quickly and efficiently, were very calm despite the massive mobs everywhere, made great drinks (not too strong which was a bit disappointing, but good) and very very professional and good looking! Every staff member I saw treated the guests equally and professionally which was so awesome to see. Encore Beach Club maintains that exclusive, sexy, hip vibe by hiring beautiful staff, but they are beautiful staff who really know how to treat their customers. Excellent! Great service!\n\nThe Beach Club is large, beautiful, clean, promotes socialization andddd there's nowhere to sit unless you want to drop a lot of money. Literally, not even a wall or bench to sit on. I understand they want to promote interaction and force people into wanting to purchase a cabana or lily bed, but the fact that I had to stand for hours upon hours in the baking sun made me leave early. There are several bars and a food station which surprisingly also moved quickly and was helpful when you're trying to get drunk but not sick. \n\nThe people here were surprisingly NOT dou****! While most of the guests here are ridiculously good looking, and probably dont include ice cream or cheese in their diets, I was pleased to see that there were actually all different types of people, various races, weights, ethnicity, and sizes here. Most people are really friendly, easy to talk to, and looking to have a fun time. There's always a few arrogant or creepy people, but that's life. The pool was a nice size and there were people dancing around it and having an awesome time laughing and swimming around. Met some really cool people here!\n\nI loved Encore Beach club! Somethings turned me off like some trash in the pool, a couple literally having sex in the pool, someone forcibly grabbing me, the no seating, and the fact that water is ONLY available for purchase. No seriously...you cannot get a cup of water. We were told there were water stations around the pool...none! So we were forced into only drinking alcohol...bummer. Other than a few outlandish things, this place is perfect and was really a highlight of my week long trip! You will have a great time here!!!! Dance floor, various bars, good music, good food. Awesomeness. Clean restrooms!
