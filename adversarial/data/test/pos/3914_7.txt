Food was fantastic but don't expect to order off the menu. Just ask for whatever they want to serve you. No soap in the bathroom, they said they were ordering a new soap dispenser...\nMost items were fried. The rice\/beans mix was dry and bland. It feels like you're traveling in a third world country. First world prices.\nMy new favorite spot!
