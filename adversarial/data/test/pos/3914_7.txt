Probably the best burger I've ever had.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I heavily mess with In-N-Out and Five Guys. They are the true homies, BUT if we're talkin bout a burger from a non-fast food facility, then this takes the cake, the frosting, the wrapper, even the fork. \n\nEverything was so fresh. Even though the burger was a handful and pretty legit, it did not feel heavy at all. Crispy yet soft bun which is the formula to a bomb burger. The herb dusted fries were spectacular as well! Shout out to their ranch too! Don't laugh cause ranch to me is make it or break it. If your ranch sucks, I'm probably not gonna eat there LOL. Yes, it's that serious. \n\nGet the lavender mint lemonade! Sooo frickin good!
