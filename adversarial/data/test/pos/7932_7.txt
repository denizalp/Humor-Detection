Came here for a nice relaxing dinner with a friend and was told I could not come in because I was wearing tank top. I had to leave and purchase a shirt before I could come back in. Upon returning the employee says \"Oh look you're back.\" And laughs. This is Fox Chapel not New York City. This establishment is lucky it even has customers . The food is over priced and the service is sub-par. I wouldn't recommend coming here...
