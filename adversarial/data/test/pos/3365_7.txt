I...do not...get...it. Why is this place so hyped up? Did I go on an off day? I went here to see what all the buzz was about and I guess I'm still looking for it.\n\nI tried the maguro, shrimp tempura, and the tempura eel roll. It was okay, didn't take me on a mind blowing sushi adventure like I was expecting... and I even had a few sake bombs to start with! Not even that could lift my expectations. \n\nWhile it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, it wasn't the worst so I'll give Tokyo Lobby that. I also wasn't too happy that I left still hungry and paid around $40 for my meal. \n\n*siiigh* I promise I'll come back and update my review, I don't want one experience to ruin my opinion of a place that fellow yelpers hold in such high regard...
