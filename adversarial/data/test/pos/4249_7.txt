Beautiful new addition in Encore Hotel. We were here in December 2015 and this place was just under construction. They have outside patio right next to the pool in a gorgeous setting with trees and flowers surrounding the whole area. Came here for Mother's Day lunch. Very good food and nicely presented, could not expect anything less of Encore and Wynn hotels. Love coming here and highly recommend to try all of their restaurants at least once !\nService was a little slow and could have been a little friendlier. Reason for 4 stars.
