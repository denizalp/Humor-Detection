\"Heaven, I'm in heaven. And my heart beats So that I can hardly speak...\"\n\nThat's how I feel about BLT burger, and that is the song that should be playing 24 hours a day.\n\nShakes - there are very few places where you can get a good shake. There are even fewer places that make a good shake with a splash of goodness that makes you smile a bit more than you did when you got off the plane to start your Vegas excursion. Well, BLT has good shakes, had good adult shakes, and will leave a smile on your face for the rest of the day.\n\nBurgers - the burgers are delicious! Savory, beefy, cheesy, and all things yummy. I can't say anything more about the burgers except that they were very good. You really just need to bite down on one yourself.\n\nFries - I say go with the waffle fries.  The skinny fries are just okay. But the waffle fries are very crispy! And a great shape for a potato!!\n\nOh man, I am craving a milkshake and burger as I sit in my DC office. I am also craving another adventure to Vegas!
