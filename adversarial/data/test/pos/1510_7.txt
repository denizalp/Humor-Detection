If I was six feet tall and a size 2 and had a very large bank account, I would drench myself in chanel.  Love the classic look.  Today I just went in because I heard from someone at the Chanel counter in Macys that this Chanel store might know of a new no 5 product that was soon to be out.  Unfortunately, they weren't aware of it so I left a little disappointed but also a little relieve that my wallet wasn't lighter!
