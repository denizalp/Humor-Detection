Considering my heritage is Irish and my name means Ireland and I feel bad I haven't been here sooner.\n\nI loved this place! It's a quaint place with dark wood, great food, comfortable seats, servers who are Natives of Ireland, and bartenders who know how to pour a proper Guinness. \n\nWe were greeted by Maggie, an Irish girl through and through. She gave us some recommendations, brought our drinks and food in timely manners and chatted with us a bit about her homeland. I don't want to sound silly but her accent made our experience here more memorable. \n\nThe menu is huge and filled with good eats and not just boiled potatoes. We ordered a few \"small plates\" including the sausage rolls and potato cakes.  The rolls were a mild sausage surrounded with puff pastry and a sweet mustard sauce. Flaky dough and meat, how can you go wrong? The potato cakes were crunchy on the outside and filled with sharp cheddar and herbs. Served with a side of sour cream, they were devoured quickly. \n\nBesides the bites we ordered the Guinness Stew and it was incredible! The perfect hearty warm comfort food you'd want on a rainy day like today. Tender pieces of beef, potato, veggies a dark Guinness gravy with creamy mashed potatoes on top. The flavors were rich and warm and I'm glad we listened to our servers recommendation and orders it. It's also served with a side of Irish Soda Bread and Kerrygold Irish butter! I could have taken a loaf home. The bread was so delicious and the butter was creamy and salty and better quality then what restaurants normally serve. \n\nI'd love to go back for the live music they have later in the evening and another pint! Slainte!
