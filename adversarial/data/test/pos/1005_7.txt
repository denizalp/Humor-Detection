This place opened about a year ago now ,I think. We have come here a few times. They open at 9:30 am which is great, and close about 7:00pm.\nThe staff here is very good, and the shop is very clean, which is a big deal to me. \nThey do mani and Pedi for both men and women. They also have waxing. eyebrow,lip, face, etc.\n\nYou can walk in or have an appt. They also do all the fake nails, Acrylics and Silk wrap. \nIt is a pleasent place, with a nice staff. \nEasy to find in the Fiesta Plaza.
