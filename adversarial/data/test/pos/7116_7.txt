We've been coming to the Cracked Egg for over two years now.  When my Son was in Middle School, we'd have a weekly Father\/Son Breakfast on Monday mornings....eat great food, read the WSJ, and talk about whatever.  Since he had today off of school, we decided to go this morning.  \n\nWe walked in and noticed a sign that said \"Ask About Our Gluten Free Menu\"....FYI for those of you that look for that menu.  The restaurant is casual and has indoor and outdoor seating.  There's counter seating too, if you're dining alone and feel more comfortable at a counter.\n\nI ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Skillet (Ground Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Seasoned Potatoes, 2 Eggs) $9.25 w\/Sourdough Toast.  Kiddo ordered a Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs w\/Sourdough Toast.....and Mom ordered the Turkey Sausage, Eggs, and Coffee Cake.....The Better Half (TBH) was the smart one and passed on Breakfast to go to her Pilates & Yoga classes while we consumed enough calories to start a Forest Fire.\n\nAfter a short wait our food was ready and brought out to the table.....it was just as I remembered.....big portions, and cooked just right. (see pics)  I had my Eggs over medium....they laid gently over the Bacon Cheeseburger and Seasoned Potatoes....I dove right in.  I'm a big fan of having the right proportion of food and they get it right here.....there's enough of each ingredient to be able to taste each flavor without overwhelming the taste buds with a single item.  The Eggs were made perfectly with the Yolk still runny but the whites cooked all the way through.  I added some Gringo Bandito Hot Sauce and devoured the entire dish!\n\nMom and Kiddo enjoyed their meal too....but needed a doggy bag to bring some of it home.  I wish I had their appetite....glad I hit the gym early this morning.\n\nAs usual, the service is great....friendly servers, kept our cup of Joe and glasses of Water full.  Another bonus is that they have a dining rewards club where you earn points for eating there and they send you offers in the mail for discounts off meals....we were redeeming a $8.00 coupon today....score!\n\nThis is hands down my favorite Breakfast spot in Vegas.\n\nWill I return?  You can count on it!
