I shop at Big Lots some times because truly their prices can not be beat on certain items, but every time I walk into this location I am waiting for a rat sized cockroach to come up to me and ask me for my wallet with a gang of vicious cockroach sized rats behind him or vice versa!\n\nRegardless, this place always looks like a tornado has gone through it, the company as a whole is defiantly not E-verifying their employees because if you ask some one were something is if you get someone that actually speaks English it would be amazing, or just in general someone that would be helpful would be nice too.\n\nI have never seen a manager there, and most of the time going through the check out can be a hassle, due to the fact that most of the people on the register look like they just recovered from smoking crack for five years are missing teeth and literally if they can not get the scanner to work, you are in for a long wait. \n\nIn any event like I said if you want cheap stuff and can deal with the tumbleweeds and dust balls blowing across the isle the venomous packs of cockroach rats and non English speaking staff then Big Lots is for you. On another note this is the best place to by cheap disposable holiday goods i.e. Halloween, Xmas crap!
