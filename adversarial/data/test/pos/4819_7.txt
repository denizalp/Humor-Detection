I have mixed feelings on this one.... and I will surely tell you why.\n\n1. Parking was easy an hour before the game. We came off Indian Bend, turned into Pavillion Blvd, paid our $5 and were parked in under 5 minutes. We would much rather not have to pay, but it was painless and we were in what would turn out to be a good spot to get out quick.\n\n2. As you walk up, you realize you are right in the heart of all the practice fields and batting cages. There are players practicing only feet away from you. Not like other fields where they are on separate grounds or are locked so you cannot get within a hundred yards to even watch. This must be what they refer to when they say that this park is \"the most fan friendly park\".\n\n3. NO FOOD IN THE PARK. What? We have been to EVERY other ballpark, and you can bring good in. There are some very specific restrictions, including no fast food at some and no open water bottles and that, but NOTHING. Unless you have a kid. Then its ok. Guess I need to borrow someone's kid. I want my carrots and fruit and granola. Those are not an option in the park, unless they are covered in chocolate. No thanks. And I cannot even say that they are for a health issue. Except that I do not want to weigh a thousand pounds. That is a health issue. Come on, lighten up. Homemade sandwich and some fruit should be allowed in. \n\n4. Lots of standing room, great lawn area (well maintained) and overall a pretty park. I will admit that.You really can see from just about everywhere. We did walk the whole park and found that you never felt very far away and had good views. \n\n5. Some creative food choices including those chocolate covered fruit kabobs and some tostada looking fried breads, besides the usual park fare. They also had a full on cold stone, though I am pretty sure you are almost paying double for it. \n\n6. They actually play take me out to the ball game. So many of the other fields have gone over to God Bless America. Come on, the 7th inning stretch is for Take me out to the ballgame. Get it straight, Salt River did. \n\n7. It is like pulling teeth to find a water fountain. If you are seated on the lawn, which is what seems to happen at spring training games these days if you did not pre buy tickets and the games are all sold out, you have to walk about a mile to one of the fountains behind the backstop areas near a bathroom. I always bring my empty water bottle to fill up.Yes, I am cheap and just want to drink my tap with my crystal light packets. Don't force people to buy drinks, they may choose not to and then suffer dehydration. Add a water fountain in the out field near a bathroom.It's not that hard.\n\nI am making a revision to my review. I had given it a 3 and then SG and I discussed the park in detail. I decided that this park was worthy of a 4, even more so than many of the other parks. I want to bring my own food and be able to get tap water from the fountain and that makes me upset. But, overall the positives really do outweigh the negatives. You really feel like you are a part of the spring training experience and not so isolated from the players. Moral of the story, if you want to eat healthy and\/or do not want to spend $50 for 2 people to have lunch, go eat at Vermont Sandwich Company off Pima and then come here. \n\n*** Be prepared, it seems that most of the games have been sold out. Check online before you go and bring a blanket for the outfield just in case. Parking is not so far that you cannot walk back and get your blanket when you find you have to sit on the grass.
