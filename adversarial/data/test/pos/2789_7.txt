I am hoping to be the 80th review of Slidin' Thru HQ.\n\nThis place is as awesome as a Hall and Oates Album, an autograph Air Supply poster, and a case of PBR.....yes....it has a special place in my heart. \n\nA couple years ago, the Slidin Thru truck aka The Slider Truck opened up, and I was blown away by it's magical levels of wonder. Did that last sentence make any sense? No. Who the hell cares?\n\nEverything about this brick and mortar location is aesthetically pleasing and matches the tone that Ric set when the truck opened for business a while back.\n\nThe Barbie, the Pep, the Ya Ya...everything is amazing. \n\nYou won't be disappointed with this place, because it truly is a gem amongst gems in Vegas. The only downside, is the location. It's a little tricky to find, so make sure that whoever is sitting shotgun, pays attention. \n\nI got lucky. I had my buddy with me, and he is astute with these things. Well done, Bruce Wayne....Well done, indeed.\n\nI can't wait to come back.\n\nP.S. More locations are going to pop up. NW and SW.....
