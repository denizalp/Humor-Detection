FURIKAKE CHICKEN! I'm sure tons of other reviews have said the same thing but let me say it one more time, FURIKAKE CHICKEN! Honestly, I can't speak for anything else on their menu because I always get this when I'm at Island Flavor, but it's worth the trip and delicious, crispy local goodness here in Vegas.\n\nI'm sure they have many other delicious items on the menu but why bother with something new when it's pretty much guaranteed that you're going to enjoy the furikake chicken? I can attest that it is on par to some of the best plate lunches\/chicken dishes that I've had back at home in Hawaii. Now, that's kind of BIG deal considering when it comes to Hawaiian\/local food here in Vegas, I'm kind of a snob comparing it to real thing. \n\nEnough said and I think I've already said furikake chicken 10 times in this review already. Go out and get yourself some! The parking is no problem here. And the staff are pretty friendly from what I've experienced. They also have a smaller 'Express' location off Eastern\/215 if you're in that neck of the woods.
