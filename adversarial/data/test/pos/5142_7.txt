Was here again during a Bear's game. I mentioned in my last review that I didn't care for their raw oysters--they didn't taste very fresh. Well, put those babies in a shooter with some vodka and bloody Mary mix and they are not bad at all. They are normally $5 but during Bear's games they're only $2.
