\"OMG! Mr. Greenjeans! I used to come here all the time for burgers,\" said the S.O. I'd never heard of Mr. Greenjeans but we stopped in for lunch so that the S.O. could have some kind of Proustian moment with a bun-encased beef patty.\n\nLooking around at the shabby-chic decor all in soothing celadon-green hues, it was hard to imagine my uber-macho mate spending his pre-teen days in a space better suited for a little girl's tea party. It's like Rachel Ashwell puked pistachio ice cream all over the chintz upholstery.\n\nFor our meal, the S.O. had his obligatory burger ($10) and I had the Tunawich ($13): seared sushi-grade tuna on baguette with crispy bacon, roasted tomato, avocado, and wasabi mayo. All burgers and sandwiches come with fries or salad. \n\nI have to say that for a mall restaurant, my Tunawich was surprisingly good. And was it ever honking; I had to take half of it home after I polished off the thick-cut fries. \n\nAccording to the S.O., the burger was solid but I think his tastes have become more sophisticated since his Greenjeans days. \n\nThere are probably better dining options around the area but for a mean Tunawich and flashback value for some, Mr. Greenjeans is at the Eaton Centre (Mews Level 4).
