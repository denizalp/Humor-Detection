What a disater and a wasre of 1 hour. Ordered the fried cod spicy and 3 shrimp with a side of fried okra. Ten minutes after I ordered I added 1 pork rib which was $3.00, wow. Ten minutes later my rib arrived without my fish. The rib was 1\/2 cold and 1\/2 hot, definately microwaved. The rib wss tough as leather and dificult to get off the bone. Another 10 minutes passed and I asked about the fish. They finally located it and in 10 minutes it arrived. The small filets were only partially breaded and were mushy. Rather than the fresh fis I expected, they brought back my childhood nightmares of frozen fish sticks. The shrimp were boxed frozen and tastless. The saving grace was the fried okra was ok and the elderly order taker did offer a free desert for the long wait. I declined as I just wanted out of there.
