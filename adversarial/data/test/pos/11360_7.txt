If you are looking for a great spot to Chuck E. Cheese it out ADULT VERSION then this place is where you want to go. Situated across of Palace Station in the old Landry's Restaurant there is so much open space filled with games, pool tables, foosball tables, big screen tvs all over the place. YES ALL OVER THE PLACE. They serve up drinks and food which you have to order at the counter. In return for the bites and drinks, you are rewarded with tokens. Tokens should be placed into machines that give you tickets because tickets mean prizes and yes they have some awesome prizes. Voodoo dolls, t-shirts, mardi gras beads and many more. If you're working in the area, than this is the spot to go to to let loose, watch a sports game (GO KNIGHTS GO!) or to have a great social event.\n\nTell me have you ever been to a place that rewards you for being a lush? No, I didn't think so. So what are you waiting for?
