It is a 20 minute drive from Summerlin, but it was worth the drive. It is a small shop inside a strip mall. There are about five small parlor tables inside. There is not much room inside when it gets busy.\n\nThe gelato was excellent. I tried the vegan peanut salted taffy. It was very good. They have several different flavors that change daily. They also have some flavors mixed together that I never seen before. You have to go there and check out the variety available.\n\nI definitely recommend that you try this place.
