I have always thought highly of this airport.  It used to be the busiest place i had ever been to. But, sadly no longer.  The flights to Vegas have been cut by the hundreds. Many of the shops and restaurants now sit empty and many gates are now abandoned.  However, what is still there is wonderful. A few good restaurants and some really cool shops just outside of security.  Restrooms are always clean and everything in them is automated. All the people that work there are very friendly and they put with a lot on some nights. Drunks, druggies, weirdos ,,,i am just telling the truth.   I hope it comes back in full glory because, it is a great place to be.  I almost forgot don't pass up all the slot machines (i have seen people win big) and there is a 24 hour fitness downstairs.
