Lissen up folks!\n\nYou're really not going to get much better than this Las Palmas location. \n\nThe prices are extremely good, the taco stand is awesome, and they have a full deli. I am not aware of any other full service grocerias in Pittsburgh. The selection is quite complete - you can get anything from a selection of dried chilis to Salvadorian crema, and the produce is well priced as well!\n\nThere's even a full cooler if you want to buy some agua con gas or Jarritos!\n\nWhen I need to find real ingredients (they also regularly carry fresh cactus paddles..) this is the true stop in da burgh.
