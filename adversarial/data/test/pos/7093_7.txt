This is the place for any types of breads and French Pastries. They always have something special on their menus for breads. Their French Pastries are freshly made and delicious. This place on Monk land can accommodate so many people. I had their maple syrup Mille Feuille and it was delicious. My stomach was full and yes even being a chain, I liked it and enjoyed the vibes. At the moment they have specials for Easter especially with their chocolates Easter eggs. In addition, their breads are all an art. I'd definitely recommend it to all as the quality of food is perfect. \n\n-:)
