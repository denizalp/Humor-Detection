It's not a trip to Las Vegas for the wife and me without a stop for cocktails at the Chandelier, specifically, level 1.5.  We stopped in for a nightcap after the \"O\" show on a Sunday night.  Whether it was because it was a Sunday night or it was still relatively early (around 9PM), we were able to grab a couple of seats at the bar, which is always preferable for us at Chandelier.\n\nI had the Original Sin ($17) made with care by Daniel, a really talented and personable bartender, consisting of Woodford Reserve Bourbon, cinnamon whiskey, Williams Wolf Pecan Whiskey, and served with an 8-spice ice sphere.  It was an excellent drink, which continually evolved both in taste and aromatics as the infused ice sphere melted.  We stopped at one since I wanted to get in a little blackjack before calling it a night.  While all of Chandelier's levels make solid drinks, Chandelier 1.5 has consistently pushed the envelope on truly original, yet deeply satisfying cocktails since the Cosmopolitan opened its doors.  Chandelier is a must for anyone who appreciates a well-made, but thoroughly unique cocktail.
