While getting four tires replaced today Sears broke one of the tire pressure sensors. They advised me i'll need a new one and told me they would have to charge me for replacing it. They broke it and therefore I feel they should be responsible for replacing it. I don't think that is a good way to do business and this will be my last visit to a Sears auto center.
