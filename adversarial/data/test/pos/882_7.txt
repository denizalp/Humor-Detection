There's something about Artisano Bakery Cafe that doesn't feel exactly right... its very name sums it up, actually. It's a name that sort of directly grabs the \"artisan bakery\" trend by the horns and tacks an \"o\" at the end of it and - Bam! You've got a franchise baby packed and ready to go. Everything from the menu, to the food, to the decor seems to reflect this - mimicking what a genuine artisan bakery\/family-owned cafe might look like. Additionally, giant signs that basically scream \"Franchise!\" everywhere seal the deal. I'm not sold.\n\nIt's a weird system - you go up to the counter, order your meal (pizza and pasta deals, soups, salads, sandwiches are your mains). Staff are friendly enough, but also a giveaway that the people behind the counter don't love or worship the food the way a true artisan establishment would. They love it the way they might love being behind a Tim Horton's counter. After ordering, you get one of those flashy black notifiers that blinks when your order is ready (wow! really traditional and authentic!). Sadly, the table next to us had a faulty one and had their meals sitting at the counter with no claimant, and a confused server running around checking everyone's flashy thinger.\n\nFood was average considering the price - pizza is a thicker dough with lots of air bubbles, and it tastes alright, fine but nothing noteworthy. Something of note, however, is a rather reasonable multigrain crust. Surprisingly doesn't taste like cardboard and there are poppy seeds! Charming! Among our party was someone who ordered soup and another who went for the cannelloni. All came with a nice crispy salad, which was perfect on the patio. In short, this place's niche is for that target market who wants something sort of more chic than Swiss Chalet, but not quite Sassafraz. \n\nI just can't get over the fact that they're called \"Artisano\".  I was set up for Puccini and I got Il Divo instead.
