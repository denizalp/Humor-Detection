I knew that I had to indulge my sweet tooth *just once* while in Vegas...\n\nSo, in typical Vegas fashion, I decided to go big or go home.\n\nThere's no better place to seriously indulge one's craving for sweets than Jean Philippe in the Bellagio, and there's no better way to indulge one's craving for sweets than Jean Philippe's pastry sampler.\n\nFor about $9, I was able to taste 3 of Jean Philippe's sublime dessert creations.  After taking a gander at the world's largest chocolate fountain (natch) and waiting in line for less than 5 minutes, I had in my hand a plate of the following:\n\n** A raspberry macaron stuffed with fresh raspberries and cream and dusted with powdered sugar.  I admit that I'm still a newbie in the world of macarons, but this macaron was delightful.  It had a beautiful chew -- not too tough or crumbly -- which played nicely with the juicy berries.\n\n** A chocolate, peanut butter, and hazelnut-filled cake lollipop.  This little package of bliss is as sinfully sweet and decadent as it sounds.  Another home run.\n\n** Crème brûlée.  As much as I adored the macaron and the lollipop, the crème brûlée was by far my favorite.  While I have a history of tasting some underwhelming crème brûlées -- whose burnt sugar top-layers taste like charcoal -- Jean Philippe manages to turn the crème brûlée top into a pristine pane of sugary glass.  It's absolutely miraculous to look at, and transcendent in both taste and texture.  The vanilla cream itself is also executed with care and skill.\n\nAs if these three desserts weren't enough -- they were all artfully placed on a base of pure milk chocolate.  \n\nYeah, we finished all of it -- including the chocolate base.  \n\n(Don't judge.)\n\nNeedless to say, my sweet tooth was satisfied.\n\nAll of Jean Philippe's sugar-laden works of art are brilliant.   Next time, I want to try try Jean Philippe's crêpes and gelato.  Heck, I'll try anything Chef Philippe comes up with.
