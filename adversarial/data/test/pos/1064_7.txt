I've avoided yelping this place for a reason; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the Hilton Village. The food is horrible, the  diners are mostly douches and although this location features less popped collars than the one in SDL I cannot figure out for the life of me why certain people and bloggers can claim this as some of the best pizza in the Valley. Sub-par food, service and experience in both locations.
