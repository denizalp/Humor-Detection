In? Am I in? \n\nOpens till 3 am? \n\nYoung Koreans hanging out? \n\nLoud music makes me feel like I am in a club?\n\nFood choices are quite limited and on the pricey side.\n\nSpicy Chicken ($15) with vegetables are quite spicy but is really a really stir fried dish. \n\nServices definitely lacking as we could not even find our waiter to order something else or even to get our bill.\n\nWith that many restaurant options in the area, I doubt I will be back here again. \n\nOut... I am Out!
