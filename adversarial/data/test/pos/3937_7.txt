Fun  and festive is how I'd describe the atmosphere inside Sabai Sabai on Song Kran day.  It was like being at home in Thailand.  Traditional music really set the tone of what was to come that evening.\n\nThe eight course dinner was out of this world.  I cannot imagine the amount of preparation that went into this.  Spicy Lao Beef Jerky, Green Mango Salad, Sweet and Sour Crispy Noodle, Lettuce Wrapped Grilled Mackerel, Hot and Sour Beef Soup, Chicken Salad (Laap Gai), Grilled Northern Thai Sausage, and Crispy Snapper Panang Curry.  Each dish was bursting with flavor.  I could taste the freshness of the herbs and the care that Chef Nuit put into it.  I enjoyed everything, but the Spicy Lao Beef Jerky, Hot and Sour Beef Soup and Grilled Northern Thai Sausage stood out the most.  \n\nThe Grilled Northern Thai Sausage, especially, was superb.  The aroma from the lemongrass and kaffir leaves sent me back to night market in Chiang Mai.  I wonder if Chef Nui takes special orders, because I have a Significant Other who is obsessed with this particular style of sausage.\n\nThen ... there was a Thai Dessert Buffet that fit for a King.  Thong Yot, Foi Thong, Thai Egg Custards and many more.  This course will probably add couple of inches to my waist, but who cares ... I'll just have to work harder at the gym.  It was worth it.\n\nThe entire Sabai Sabai Team had really outdone themselves.  Awesome feast, casual and fun atmosphere, it was the perfect place to ring in the New Year.
