When the delivery driver came back with the pizza, he told us that the pizza he had grabbed was the one the chef was eating while making our pizza... Not sure if that's supposed to be comforting?\n\nAnother update as well, I don't know if it is the owner or what but I have been harassed now several times for posting this review. Not good business practice!
