classic dive bar in a town of disposability.  It would be three stars at most ,even in a place like LA that still even has dozens of these types of places.  Also a hilarious barmaid (I guess you better have some personality if you are working this place at 10 AM when we showed up).  Her best lines: \"Vegas was better when the Mob ran everything.  You wouldn't see some gangbanger leaping into a casino cage to steal money, a dozen guys would have opened up on him before he made it into the parking lot.\"  Also \"Oh, no thirty years ago the casinos had some personality, not like the sinister corporate places they are now.\"  We laughed, happy to drink a $2 PBR after getting raped for cocktails on the strip.  If you are heading downtown include it as a diversion from tossing money down a rathole back on the Strip.
