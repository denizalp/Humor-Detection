How did I know that I have arrived in Vegas? Slots machine awaiting for me the moment I walk out the gate!! \n\nHaven't come to this airport for many years. It has definitely changed a lot. Lots of food vendors and retailers. Many seating area for dining. No need to eat at the gate waiting area. There are charging stations. \n\nVery decent airport and well maintained.
