I will preface this by saying I am not much of a Beatles fan. Their music is good and I can appreciate it, but its not something I hold near and dear or seek out.  Most people that were here to see the show were beatles fans, which was fun, except for the lady that sang out loud to every song and couldn't stay within the her imaginary boundaries that the seat arms created.  \n\nI did enjoy the show, but at times it did get a little slow and kind of boring. When it picked up, it was kind of cool.  I am glad I saw it, but I wouldn't see it again and I'm not sure I would recommend it to a non-Beatles fan.
