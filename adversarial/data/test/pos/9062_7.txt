Plenty of reviews already so I am going to jump right into it. For sure make reservations if you want to sit in the tree house. We did and we loved it! Waiter was really nice and explained the menu to us while suggesting very popular items. \n\nFor appetizers we started off with the \"Oyster Rockefeller\" and \"Sauteed Shrimp\".\nThe oysters were not bad but let's just say we won't order them again. The shrimp on the other hand were very delicious. Had great seasoning and the creamy butter sauce was pretty amazing.\n\nMain course le boyfriend and I each both had the \"22oz Bone in Ribeye\". And for sides we did the \"Lobster mashed, Cream corn & Sauted mushrooms\". Both steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. \"Seriously best steak I've ever had in my life\"... those were the boyfriends words since this was my first time in over a year eating red meat. But I have to agree with him. The lobster mashed potatoes were so creamy and buttery. Cream of corn was very tasty, almost reminded me of the mexican corn with out all the cheese. The saut√©ed mushrooms were also very delicious. Very happy with the entrees and sides we got. I fell in love with all of them.\n\nLas but not least, DESSERT!. \nWaiter brought us out a chocolate piece of cake with fresh whipped cream. I did not care so much for this cake as it was a little on the dry side for me but eh it was complimentary for our Anniversary. I knew I had to order the famous Butter Cake so I did. The butter cake came out super warm with a big scoop of ice cream on top. Okay so this cake was good but I feel like I've had better dessert. I hate salt on any dessert so this was a huge downfall for me. Cake tasted like a very sweet, buttery corn bread. I don't know how to make out of this cake but if I go back I probably won't order it again. Yes I know very sad as everyone literally worships this cake. Over all I had a great experience and I cannot wait to go back again. I think this is my new favorite steak house.
