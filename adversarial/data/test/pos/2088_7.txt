I drive a 1997 Lexus SC400.  The mechanism that holds the driver's side sun visor up broke.  I made several fruitless attempts to have it repaired or replaced.  The part has been discontinued.  This is the place that had the sun visor in the right color, dark grey.  Pretty much all the visors at other places seemed to be tan.  I called and spoke w\/ a helpful man who confirmed that they had the driver side visor.  It was $35, which seemed very reasonable to me.  He estimated it would cost $15 to ship it to me, which also seemed reasonable.  It arrived maybe a week later, in pristine condition.  It was securely packed in a recycled Amazon box.  The packing material was a torn up cardboard box, recyclable.  These folks are environmentally conscious.  I really liked that.  A lot.  This was an excellent experience.
