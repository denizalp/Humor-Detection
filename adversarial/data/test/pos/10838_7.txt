Starbucks, in MY neighborhood!  Of course it is gonna get 5 stars!\n\nI stopped by on day 2 of opening around 6:30am.  I had to.  I got my butt to the gym at 5:30 so I deserved a good cup of java.  Lo and behold, to my pleasant surprise, this location offers the Reserve coffees brewed Clover style!  I could have done, yet another, happy dance!  \n\nEmployees were pleasant and all working steadily.  My drink was perfectly made and I was happy as a clam.  \n\nThis location isn't huge, but Starbucks did a nice re-model and it appears more open and spacious.  This location also boasts a drive-thru which is welcome when ordering simple drinks and the weather is crappy.  \n\nWhile some of you complain against the bux, I like that I can get a consistent, decent cup of coffee made to my liking.  I'm a fan!
