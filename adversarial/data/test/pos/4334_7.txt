This was my first time here. It was okay, not a place where it would be my AYCE Korean spot. The food is pretty limited... not many banchan to chose from. They did not have any gochujang. I wanted to make some bibimbap. \n\nFood: 3.5 stars\nService: 4 stars\n\nThey were attentive. They replaced our grill when needs to be changed. Checked on us when our plates were looking empty. Friendly service!\n\nWould I come here again? Maybe, if I was shopping at the Galleria mall.
