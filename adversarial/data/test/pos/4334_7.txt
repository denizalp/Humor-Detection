just finished ordering and the staff was so rude to me. They were upset that I touched the glass and the \"pizza topper applied\" was obviously upset that he makes 7.75 per hour but he is definitely not a case for raising the minimum wage. I have a food allergy and they were so so so rude about it. Beware of bad customer service.
