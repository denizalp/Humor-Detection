One of my favorite things about K'O Donnell's is their amazing patio! When the weather is nice this is an awesome place to hang out.  For a sports bar the food is awesome. From the prime rib wrap to the southwest salad you cannot go wrong with any menu choice. They also have a fair amount of beers on tap which is always a plus. My only complaint is sometimes the service can be pretty slow. That being said the waitresses are friendly. As someone who works nearby this is one of my favorite places to hang out after work. Keep being awesome K'O's !
