I volunteered here last weekend as part of a Helping Hands meet up group. I was so impressed with this facility! It's so colorful and clean and actually cheery. \n\nI learned so much about bunnies. They are intelligent beings that like things a certain way, so much that each little playpen is mapped out. When we were cleaning each area out, we knew exactly how to put things back the way things were so the bunnies didn't \"riot\" and throw things around in protest. \n\nMost of the bunnies are litter box trained. Carrots are not exactly healthy for them to eat all the time since they are like candy to them and too high in carbs for them. The hay that they eat helps trim back their teeth since they constantly grow. \n\nThere was a play area for the bunnies so every few hours, the bunnies got a turn to run around. They are not meant to be caged all the time. I learned that they are meant to be free in the house and roam free with the rest of the family. \n\nThis sanctuary is very careful about adoptions. They never let people adopt in the same day because they want people to know what they are getting into. There is a year long wait list to accept bunnies from families who cannot handle raising them on their own. This facility also sometimes boards bunnies as well. I really loved volunteering here though and would not hesitate to do it again.
