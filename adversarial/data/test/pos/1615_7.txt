Decided to indulge in my late night calling for an amazing sub. I am so glad that I have one this close to my house and that is open 24\/7. This subway is tucked away in a parking lot that is very dark and gloomy at night due to the emptiness of the massive shopping complex it is located in, but is close enough to the road to be seen. One has to love Vegas for it is a 24 hour town and this is one of the few restaurants left that abides by the Vegas rules of all night rules.\n\nThis store is very well lit and safe for customers to answer their late night cravings. With a very clean store and wonderful sandwich artists it's a win win. I was greeted as I walked through the door and was in luck since I was the only customer at the time in the store. The sandwich artist went through the regular bread choices and we did our little toppings dance. Then off to the register with a swipe of the card the sandwiches traded hands and was mine to indulge in.\n\nThe subs were all amazing and hit the spot. I ordered a turkey and Swiss for me and the twins had roast beef subs. The turkey was just what I needed to recover after the loss of our fabulous Knights game to the Capitals. The sub artist was able to share in our defeat but his recommendation of the turkey sub tasted oh so great and fresh made me sleep very soundly.
