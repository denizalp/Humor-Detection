I effing HATE this place!\n\nI will only come here for a band I just can not miss.\n\nTickets - Online in advance is more expensive than buying at the door. They'll charge you like $6 for buying online & another undisclosed $3 for will call. Lying cheating bastards.\n\nLines & waiting - I didn't have to wait at all. There were barely any people there yet. I got there at 6:30 and ended up pretty close to the stage.\n\nFrisking & pat downs - These will be done by a same gendered person. Girls, they'll want to look in your purse.\nThis is pretty much against the 4th Amendment:\n\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...\" \nBut if you bitch they have the right to refuse service\/entrance. Fun!\n\nDecor & cleanliness - It's pretty dirty everywhere. But that's to be expected. Lots of people coming & going all the time. You'll look up to see that the ceiling is bare & exposed. Pray your bladder holds out on you until you can get to another location. Don't even go into the restrooms if you don't have to, you'll wish you had a hazsmat suit on. Yuck!\n\nDrinks - There's a bar & they don't separate people under 21. I imagine it would be easy for an older friend to get under 21 people drunk in the crowd :D\n\nHeat - It's constantly hot. No matter what the weather outside is like go dressed like you do in the middle of summer phx heat. There was 1 lousy fan blowing. It might as well not even have been there.\n\nMusic - For some reason between bands they play weird music that doesn't fit the style you're there to see. I saw Fireworks, Saves the Day, Hellogoodbye, & New Found Glory. They played 80's pop music. Ok...\n\nSound - The sound didn't suck as much as other reviews led me to believe. It's up to the band to make the sound people get it right. Hellogoodbye made sure they sounded good. Saves the Day, not so much.\n\nSecurity - Never enough!!! There were some big beefy dudes up front to push back or catch the crowd surfers. I saw 2 guys actually in the crowd. With all the moshing going on, that's not gonna cut it. People got kicked in the head, elbowed, spit on, stepped on, pushed, almost crushed, & even I almost got into a fight w\/ a short asshole mosher that might have been a guy... perhaps when his balls drop. Prepare to leave with bruises.\n\nBasically, this place is like an armpit or perhaps the donkeys ass of venues.\nFail.
