What could be a better show to watch after a dinner at the whimsical Rose.Rabbit.Lie. other than Cirque du Soleil's Zumanity? This was the first time my BF seeing the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil, so I booked the seats 3 months ahead just to make sure we're sitting on the second row. (First row are loveseats, be prepared to be invited up the stage if you do decide to sit on those seats :)\n\nOf course, Zumanity is far more than just the \"sensual\" side of Cirque du Soleil. The show integrated different aspects (or fetishes) of human sexuality. I particularly enjoyed how daring their version of a threesome, which involved two male lovers and a woman. Since this was my third time seeing the show (and yes, they did tweaked the acts,) and assuming we'd be watching the show with a fun crowd, I purposely booked a Friday 9:30 PM show. Nevertheless, I was still flabbergasted to learn just how people are really evolving backwards based on the audience's reaction, or rather, lack of...\n\nKudos to the performers of Zumanity, especially the MC, Edie. (Good lord, how do you entertain a theatre full of Jesus Freaks?!) If it weren't for the fun folks sitting on the balcony, the people sitting in the orchestra made the entire theatre looked like a funeral!! There was even one of those \"macho man\" type of loser sitting next to us, he was acting all belligerent toward the male\/gay performers. Honestly, what was he trying to prove other than he's extremely uncomfortable with his own sexuality?\n\nPeople, please! If you decide to go watch Zumanity, please keep an open mind or you'd be ruining it for people who actually wanted to have a good time. Then again, I'm sure there's plenty of bars on the strip where you can showcase your stupidity and still manage to find the woman who buys it...
