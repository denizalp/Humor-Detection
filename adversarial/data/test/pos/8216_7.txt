Many of us don't have dental insurance these days, but we want to maintain our pearly whites, so we seek out affordable dental care to get our teeth checked and cleaned. I thought $39 was a sweet deal, so I made an appointment. \n\nI arrived for my appointment promptly and took a seat to wait. 45 minutes of sitting, enduing some children's movie blaring on the waiting room TV and I was escorted back. They took the x-rays as the ad promised and then the doctor came back to have a look as I awaited my cleaning. I was told I have the early stages of gum disease and they couldn't clean my teeth because it would do no good. They stated that I needed to have a \"deep cleaning,\" which runs several hundred dollars IF you decide to purchase their insurance to get the cost down. So with a $39 charge on my card, a quote of almost a thousand dollars and no teeth cleaning, I left Durango Dental.\n\nWith so many random strip mall dentists with no reputation in this town, I thought it would be best to go somewhere else to actually have a cleaning, check-up and second opinion. That may cost a bit more, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place, but they don't try and rip you off. \n\nI had my appointment and the second dentist said he said there were no signs of gum disease at all. I had my teeth scraped, polished and cleaned like any standard visit and was sent my on my way.\n\nVisiting another dentist way cost more, but maybe this is just another lesson in getting what you pay for.
