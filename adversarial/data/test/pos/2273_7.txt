My hats off to \"foodista\" supreme Viviana M for leading a mass exodus of us hungry Yelpers, apr√®s Elite event to the savoury oasis of the surprisingly underrated Parkette.\n\nAfter being turned away from The Cunty General, and Oyster Boy for being either too large a party or too late, in a last ditch effort we'd arrived at Parkette with sheepish grins and growling bellies, hoping for a place of gastronomic sanctuary.  My heart (and stomach) beamed with delight as the AMAZING server and kitchen chefs warmly welcomed us to dine at Parkette, thus becoming our epicurean angels of mercy.  \n\nThe ambiance is very intimate and warm, probably an excellent choice for a romantic dinner too and the aromas emanating from the kitchen were intoxicatingly heavenly.  Also worth noting, considering our sizeable party of 11 and late arrival, our food was served quite expediently and our server was super pleasant and absolutely on the ball.\n\nMy meal consisted of a Roasted Chicken with a grape sweetened gravy, stewed greens with Corn Grits (abso-fricking amazing!).  Let's just say the meal was so extrordinarily good that I couldn't even finish my sentences as my reserves of energy were spent by my tastebuds going into overdrive trying to soak in every last iota of mad deliciousity (yep, I made up a word cuz it's so damned good!) dished out by the virtuosos of Parkette.  Admittedly I was high as sh*t on my food, but from what I could gather around me, my companion's meals were also consumed with much flavouful zeal.\n\nFor dessert I order the Beignets filled with strawberry jam and vanilla sabayon dipping sauce on the side, this ain't your average Timbit and f*ck yeah those too were amazing!\n\nYes, a gratuity was added to our bill for our large party, but for food and service this exceptional it was well worth the expense.  \n\nNext time you're hungry, want a classy meal and are in the general vicinity of Queen far west, please don't waste your time lining-up at some of the other joints, and get your ass to Parkette NOW!
