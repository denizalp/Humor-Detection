We came here for a birthday party!  It was so much FUN!  The waiting area is open and clean.  There is a bar to get some happy on before the movie.\n\nIn the movie theater itself, they have three (maybe four) rows or tables counters with office chairs or the individual seats with sliding tables.  The birthday girl and her friends out the comfy individual seats, so us folks got the table counters with office chairs.  The office chairs were not that comfortable (and reminds me of work).  \n\nThe movie and sound quality was the same as any other movie place.  The food was yummy!  I got the coconut panko chicken tenders with fries.  You get 6 pieces of chicken not 3 or 4 and plenty of fries.  Service was great.\n\nThose office chair comfort - minor 1 star.
