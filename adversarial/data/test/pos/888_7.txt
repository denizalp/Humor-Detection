Slowly, but surely, Diner Deluxe has wormed its way from one of the spots I love to frequent for breaky or a late lunch to the only spot I'll actually go and wait in line for on a Sunday morning. Is it the food? Is it the service? Is it the fact that its also got things going on outside of breakfast and doesn't close at 3pm every weekday? \n\nIt is, in fact, all of these... and so much more. The menu is host to many of my favourite foods that I didn't even know could be my favourite foods because nobody else has them (or at least nobody else does them like DD) - like potato pancakes, breakfast poutine, big fluffy pancakes and good morning sliders. And have you looked at the long list of local suppliers on the website?\n\nThe coffee is free while you wait in line. And though the Urban Baker seems to have gone through its nine lives, (sniff, meow), it's at the very least a space gone to good use. Now, in the middle of winter, you don't wait in a long lineup outside. Nono, you cozy up inside on the non-existent bakery side. To make matters better (not worse, better!), it's no shitty diner coffee either. It seems Phil and Seb's is taking over the world... or at least Calgary. I'm seeing it served in a host of my favourite places. DD is no exception.\n\nAnd the staff? Also exceptional. Last month, I was in and our server, Jennea kept us well looked after AND told us about a local market she was featuring some of her jewelry in. Last weekend, I was down at the East Village Christmas market and who should I find? But the very same Jennea. She remembered me before I did her. And she's not the only friendly sort with a good memory that you'll find at DD.\n\nWhile Diner Deluxe does have its drawbacks (I'm really not digging whatever material the new menu is printed on... the actual menu items, right on. But that plastic stuff that's hard to keep open? What's that about? Also, it can be a tight fit between tables. If you've got a hand talker with you, make sure they're sitting on the bench seats against the wall, otherwise, calamity and spilled things may ensue. And, the breakfast sandwich... tasty, but too messy! You'll have sauce dripping down your fingers in about 3 seconds. Don't order if it's your first \"morning after\" breakfast together *wink wink*), I'm finding myself here more and more often.\n\nKudos on the consistent delivery, Diner Deluxe. You're the first place I bring any new visitor to Calgary and a spot I have no troubles starting... or ending... my day with.
