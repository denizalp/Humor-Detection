I can't stand the boutique accents.  Seriously, aromatherapy for a movie theater entrance?  And waiting for a popcorn and soda here is just like waiting for a drink at a bar.  Oh wait... It is a bar!  I'm not sure I care because I'm a \"popcorn at the theater\" person.\n\nBut the seats are the high point, very comfortable. And quibbles aside, it's a great date spot. You can also get your parking validated when you pay for your tickets which is convenient.  \n\nFor the love of all things holy please don't bring little kids here!  This is a movie house for grown-ups.  Keep it sacred!  I only wish they would continue to elevate the movie experience and not simply turn it into a pretentious, fake, expensive nightclub vibe like the rest of downtown.
