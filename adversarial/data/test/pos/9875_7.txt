This li'l hole in the wall loc8ed in a shopping plaza is somewhat of a diamond in the rough. They do have a tiny section in front w\/ a couple of plain tables & chairs in case u want 2 eat there (no decor), but it's really known more 4 Delivery & take out (like PJ's but different style).\n\n   Have ordered their Awesome WHITE PIZZA & Scrumptious SPANIKOPITAS Countless Xs, as well as their Veggie Cold Sub, the Vegetarian Stuffed & Pesto pizzas, fried Mushrooms, Zucchini & Greek salad on occasion. They also have Amazing BAKLAVA, NY cheesecake, & Chocol8 Fudge Cake 4 desserts (all delectable depending on ur palate's mood).\n\n   There's only 1 particular time the order was wrong & nothing was done or even offered 2 correct it, so my friend  justifiably disputed some of the charges w\/ his bank, hence the 4 instead of 5* r8ing. Un42n8ly I think it was a case of the preparer that evening hitting the reefer a li'l 2 much, so they really didn't care until they must have heard an earful when the reversal was discovered.\n\n   Then they tried 2 blacklist my friend 4 any future orders which was REDICULOUS as the only reason some of the charges were disputed & then reversed by his bank was due 2 the screw~up + apathetic crappy attitude from the pothead(s) that time. Not 2 mention, was ineffective as I'd just place orders from my place using my card instead 4 Deliveries or do a pick~up if I was out~n~about running errands etc so hopefully THEY learned the necessary lesson &\/or eventually made replacements w\/ better preppers. All I know is it didn't happen again 42n8ly 4 them because we've given them TONS of Business!!! They weren't gonna keep us from what we luved when THEY messed up once... which is personally a true compliment 2 their White Pizza, Spanikopitas, & Baklava's (our standard order).\n\n   Really, I can't slight them 4 more than 1* after all the Xs we've ordered where everything was correct, fresh & the 1derful tasty quality we'd always known them 4, so a Fave they'll remain as long as such continues 2 b the case. It bothers me when a good place can have\/get a poor reflection just because of who's working that day or night (which shouldn't matter, nor b the case). So Management (if there is 1) should more closely monitor & \"weed\" out (pun intended) those who can hurt their biz by doing such while on the clock @ their job...
