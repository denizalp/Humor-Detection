I love dunking raw meat into hot, sweet broth.  So, after a round of \"eenie meenie miney moe\" with my Groupons, I settled on Swish.\n\nThe restaurant: The setup of Swish is interesting.  At Swish, you're seated at a long, u-shaped counter with a hot pot placed in front of each diner. Unfortunately, the pot is placed in an awkward location, forcing the diner to reach up over the bar, and then at a downward angle, to swish their food.  For someone with short, Tyrannosaurus Rex arms (like me), it was really difficult to eat.  I definitely prefer the more intimate, table setting found at other shabu-shabu places around town.\n\nThe food: The selection of veggies served with the shabu-shabu\/sukiyaki dishes were lackluster.  I probably received half a head of cabbage and two mushrooms in total. I thank them for all that fiber, but, can I please get some more tofu? However, I did enjoy my prime rib sukiyaki which was thinly cut and lean.  The unlimited rice is also nice.\n\nOverall, I would likely go back if I was in the neighborhood. Nextime, however, I'd probably ask for the booster seat to help with eating at the awkward angle (why do you hate the shorties, Swish?).
