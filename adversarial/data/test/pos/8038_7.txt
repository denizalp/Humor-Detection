When I first arrived in Calgary, everywhere I went was determined by the proximity to my apartment.  Cutting Room Floor was no exception.  It was the closest salon to my apartment, so naturally my first choice.\n\nMy hair is pretty easy to cut, nothing too fancy, so usually it's pretty easy to get right.  Cutting Room Floor was successful every time I went.  The stylists are very friendly and drove the conversations, which is important if you like to chat.  The salon was always kept clean, and I never had to sit in a chair covered in the previous customers hair (a common and annoying occurrence at hair salons).\n\nThe only downside at Cutting Room Floor is the price.  Including tip, the haircut would cost me around $40, which is pretty obscene for a regular cut like mine.  The price certainly drove me elsewhere, but if you have lots of money laying around, they are certainly a great salon.
