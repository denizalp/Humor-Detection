Tea Space has the best boba in the area but the sweetest teas- but at least they're consistent with both. Cope by specifying less sweetness for your order and you should be good to go. Service is great, which is an anomaly for places that are adjacent to Spring Mountain Road.\n\nDecor is cute with a cat theme, menu is pretty large, and the sizes are good for the price. For first time visitors, staff tend to recommend the house teas, which seem to be extra-sweet due to being made with half and half or cream? Unclear, but too sweet for me. They're great about adjusting or remaking drinks to fit your preference- the wintermelon beverages are refreshing in this ungodly summer heat.\n\nNote that their signage is a bit faded and the storefront looks like it might be closed from the outside- it's in the same little building as the diabetic sweets bakery, and seems to have popped up overnight.\n\nEDIT: Dropping a star. Service has been lacking the past couple of times I've been here. They're open late but manage to make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them if I pop in and interrupt their chat time as the only customer after 10PM.
