The most generous word I can use to describe this burger as is \"unique\". The patty was charred and tasted like a hot dog for some reason. The texture was also rubbery like a hot dog as opposed to being tender. I've had tastier veggie patties than this. I was deeply disappointed with the burger after waiting so long for it (almost half an hour!). It was totally not worth the calories and the money.
