Lived in the building for almost 3 years...Lets just say it has came a long way.  As with anything there are good points and bad points.  Overall I do like the building, however a few things people should know before moving in.\n\n1.  There is NO waiting list ! haha yes that is correct they have plenty of units available for rent however they like creating a buzz and an extreme interest in the property so they can keep the rents high.  So what do they do ?  They tell you if you would like to join the waiting list so when something comes up for rent your be the first to know...LoL  the oldest trick in the book.  I confirmed this with a ex employee who worked there. Lots of units for rent if your willing to pay the price $$$$$\n\n2.  Yes the zappos crash pads located through-out the building are annoying (groups of people always clogging the elevator, taking up guest parking, standing around blocking doorways) and not to mention seems like they get more preferred treatment from the staff.  Parking where they want, making noise etc etc\n\n3.  Parking is a issue but unless you work for Z or rent 50 plus units in the building then you get plenty of parking otherwise plan on 1 parking space for unit.  The HOA offers no help in trying to locate another parking space or solution for your roommate or whoever lives with you that may happen to drive.  \n\nMy opinion:  There have been talks of selling off the units to private owners...I feel this would be better not only for the building but for the people who live in the condos.  Then the individual owners have a say on what goes on...Not just the HOA and management company....Might take away that prison feeling ha ha.  \n\nI hope this helps.
