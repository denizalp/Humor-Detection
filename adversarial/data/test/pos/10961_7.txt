So I am very picky about my Mexican food & to be honest the ONLY reason we came to this place is because Oregano's was on their usual 50 hr wait. I was pretty scared when we walked up to it, and was just as scared when we were seated.  Before we got a chance to situate ourselves water & chips & salsa were in front of us.  The chips & salsa were good, not amazing but it was good & i had my fair share of them. I was VERY impressed with our servers speed & attention.  The entree prices are kinda pricey...meaning $11-$13 a plate but we ordered them anyway.  To my surprise the food was GREAT! I don't remember the name of the plate I ordered but it had an enchilada, a taco, & a tamale.  EVERYTHING was good! I mean, not blow your mind you'll never have anything better than this again, but it was very tasty.  If we ever have to long of a wait at Oregano's again, we will return.  However we live in Phoenix so the chances of us being in Scottsdale again just for Mexican food are slim.  But I would recommend it to anyone who wants good food & speedy service.
