We used Rose Tuxedo for the men in our wedding. They did a great job! We needed specific shirts, and they were able to accommodate. We had some guys coming into town and needed to get fit at the last minute, and they worked with us to make all alterations on time. The employees were nice and took great care of us. The place is not in the best part of town, but if you can get past the location and know you are getting a great deal and will be taken care of, use Rose Tuxedo for any event requiring a tuxedo or suit!!!
