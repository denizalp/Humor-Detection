Food was good, The service not so much from my point of view. I went there with a group of other 6 girls to have our weekly get together. The waitress threw our checks in the middle of the meal while we were still having wine and drinks. We weren't asked if we wanted something else like a refill or another glass of wine. She took the cards and close our tabs pretty fast and I was Ok with that because I thought she would come back but she didn't even though we were still there for like another hour. I was there sitting and drinking my melted ice and waiting ANY of the waitress to come back or make eye contact so I could order dessert and another drink on a different tab, but none of them ever came even though we waved our arms and the thing is the girls weren't that busy. One was just talking and giggling with a group of guys at the bar, another was just taking care of 2 older guys in another table which I usually wouldn't mind if I could only had a chance to order what I wanted.
