Everyone knows the Chicago style popcorn is the best. Cheddar and Caramel? Sounds horrible,  I had thought, but once I tried it I was hooked. Somehow those two flavors, completely different, make the best combo in your mouth. Hands down. \n\nPopcorn prices are normal for the strip, but so worth it. They also sell tins of it, which can come in handy when storing your pounds of popcorn that will only last a few hours at most.
