Great hidden jem of las vegas.  Tucked away in a spot right in between my office building and many others.  The food it absolutely fabulous,  hits the spot every time.  I have always been greeted with a smile from the owner, such a people person.  I will definitely keep coming back just a 5 minute walk from my office.  Cheers....
