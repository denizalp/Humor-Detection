I don't really care how much the cost is really. But the fact that I don't have any knowledge about how much brakes really cost and how it's done then I went to Facebook and ask for feedbacks. \n\nThe issue with me is... How and why did that guy who worked in a \"professional brakes services\" parked my car close to the cement block is just Unacceptable to me. My family goes to your company to change brakes. That's the reason why I went there. But I guess I won't be going to this place anymore. Can't trust my car in this place. \n\nPlease learn your lesson this time around or take some parking lessons. Thanks for reading
