I'm a huge fan of both Tacos and Tequila so I was stoked to finally hit RuRu's for dinner!  \n\nMy bride and I went on a Thursday evening and had the Three Amigos trio (Salsa\/Guacamole\/Queso) and a couple margaritas for the first round.  We then dove into the 'It Was The Dukes\", \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\", \"Looking Good Louis\", and \"Long Duk Dong\".  \n\nOverall it was pretty good but I'd say a tick expensive for what you get.  Our bill with tip was over $80.  The Three Amigos trio was wonderful but enough for 4 people.  The \"Looking Good Louis\" was our favorite taco as the others seemed to lack seasoning and depth.\n\nI wouldn't say they are the best taco option but if you are in that area and want a wonderful vibe with a great bar, give it a shot!  The margaritas are $9.75 but quite the upgrade if you want better tequila.  The shot of Don Julio Reposado was $14 so quite steep compared to other places like ... other local taco\/tequila options.  I would rate 3.5 stars so I'll round up and visit again for final thoughts.
