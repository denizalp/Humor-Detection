This place is extremely over-hyped! Or maybe just the name if famous for it's candy and NOT it's food; that MUST be what it is. \n\nMy bf and I came here one night while we were in Vegas and it was meh to say the least. The food was horrible and way overpriced. I guess it was pricey since they are on the strip and they have a famous name but really? How are they still in business? The pasta I ordered was blan and nothing memorable. Only good thing was the drinks!
