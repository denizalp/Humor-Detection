This restaurant will lure you in with the inexpensive family style combos, but unfortunately the service is horrendous and very little to be desired. The waitress\/cashier woman (I suspect she's the girlfriend of the younger male who's also at the cash register).  She is a total B!TCH!    She will give you attitude for no apparent reason, she acts as if the customers are all a nuisance to her.   Word of advice to the owners, tell your son to leave his bitchy girlfriend at home and to stop ruining your customers experience.
