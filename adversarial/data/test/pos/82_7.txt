Horrible, went there for an iced coffee, took a MEDIUM cup, from the stand area marked MEDIUM and the guy tried charging me for a large.\nTold him to keep it and went to Starbucks across the street.\n\nThe guy would not answer me as to why the MEDIUM was in the LARGE slot, only insisted I pay for a large, There is much better on the Danforth.
