\"Burrito's are gods currency\"- Malcolm X\n\nI love Chipotle. There is never a time of it being bad.\nThe only thing you have to worry about in this location \nis them under-Meating you. There is a girl who works there\nwho assumes 1 strand of barbacoa is more than enough and 3 strands counts\nas double meat.  I haven't seen her lately so the government must have hired her to run our budgets once they figured out how stingy she was. \nMore often than not this isn't a problem with the other employees\nas everyone there seems to be aware of a decent meat situation.\n\nPros: Lovely taste, fresh ingredients, fast service and good napkins.\n\nCons: Diarrhea
