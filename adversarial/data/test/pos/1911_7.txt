-COMFORTABLE\/NICE SPACE \n-EXCELLENT FOOD (ALL UNDER $10)\n-KITCHEN OPEN LATE (ORDERIN' AROUND MIDNIGHT)\n-PINTS = $5\n\nI liked this place a lot.\n\nOnly think I wasn't a fan of :\n\nThe bathrooms are like a maze to get to. Long hallways, numerous doors, a creepy stairwell up to Bloor that is blocked off. I felt like I was about to walk into a scene from Hostel. \n\nDaniel B wrote a better review. \n\nTTYN,\n\nPAT
