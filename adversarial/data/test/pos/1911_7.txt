Don't let the strip mall location and unappealing facade deter you from popping in to Top Design Nail where no appointment is needed.  Upon entering, I was greeted verbally or with a smile by several employees and promptly escorted to a chair.  Since a I was wearing a knee-length skirt, my tech provided me with a small towel to place across my knees--as a hoohah hider.  Thanks!!!  The shop is busy, but clean. The \"basic\"  pedi included soaking, nipping, shaping, rubbing away any callouses, moisturizing,a sugar scrub, foot and leg massage, and a relaxing hot towel across the top of the feet.   The foot and leg care lasted at least 40 minute,, maybe longer as I became engrossed in making a selction from the myriad of choices for nail art.  My tech was able to improvise to give me the 4th of July themed deco that I was looking for.  \n\nI was very pleased with the attentiveness and skill of the tech, particularly with the clipping and shaping, as I've had some ingrown toenail issues in the past.  The cost for all of this, including the toe art was was only $19 ( I was there on a Tuesday and I think the prices might be a little less Mon-Wed)  Now,I must mention that there is a $2 fee for using a credit or debit card, but that policy is prominently displayed, so did not come as a surprise.  If your are looking for excellent service, friendly staff, great prices and don't mind a \"down-scale\" environment, this is definitely your place.  I will definitely return.
