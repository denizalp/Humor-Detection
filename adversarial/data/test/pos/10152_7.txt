Congrats on 3 years, I happened to be here when they were being recognized and celebrated for it.  Damn, have I been coming here for 3 years and only now writing a review?!\n\nI'm just getting back from Seattle where coffee is around every corner but really good coffee shops in Las Vegas are a dime a dozen and there are few that offer food that matches the quality of their drinks.\n\nI've been here numerous times now, to sit in\/out, and take out and I've pretty much know exactly what I want now.  The Smoked Lox (salmon bagel), and a cooled off lavender infused latte.  \n\nI love salmon bagels and the one they have here I have to say is one of the best I have ever tasted.  And for your lavender latte, let it cool a little bit before you burn your tongue and can't taste any of the lavender.
