The only vegetarian entree, which was a gnocchi at $26, included a choice of either a caesar salad or a wedge salad with bacon and egg, neither of which was vegetarian. We had them substitute it with a beet salad and they said that it would be an up-charge of $2. My wagyu burger came medium to well, not medium rare as ordered. \nI will not be coming back.
