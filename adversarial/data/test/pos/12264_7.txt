This gym is PERFECT. \n\nExactly what you need and nothing else. Dethrone is a small gym but spacious enough for a group to get in a great work out. \n\nI came in with a friend who was already a member of dethrone. Heidi, the instructor for the class was amazing. She kept the class going and pushed us! There was not a soul that slacked. The work out consists 30 1minute strength exercises with 1minute cardio cycling sessions in between. The classes are truly for all fitness levels since you can choose whether to challenge yourself or cool down while on the bikes.Workout ends with ab work and stretching. \n\nIf I didn't live on the complete opposite side of town I would sign up for their monthly membership in a heartbeat. Unfortunately driving that far everyday to get in a work out doesn't make too much sense. \n\nChecked out their website and they are currently running a 25% off your first month promo. They also offer individual classes for 19.99 but the first class is FREE!
