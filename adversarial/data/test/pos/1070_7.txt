Had the chance to check out this Indian eatery last week and was pleasantly surprised by the result. My friends and I came in during dinner so I didn't have a chance to see what the lunch buffet was like. Saffron looks nice and doesn't have that overplayed Bollywood theme you see at many other Indian restaurants. Service was quick and friendly. \n\nThe chicken tikka and butter chicken we ordered were both pretty good. At a spicy level of 7\/10 neither was really that spicy but still flavorful. The portions were small but came with rice and the garlic butter naan was excellent. For dessert we ordered Gulab Jamun and thankfully the syrup wasn't overly sweet and had a subtle hint of rose. Saffron was a little on the pricey side for what you get but the quality is there. Ill probably come by to check out the buffet if I'm in the area.
