I am so disappointed by BATL. We had planned a bachelorette party here months ago as it had come highly recommended by our friends in Toronto. 2 days before the event we receive an email from management checking in on our numbers, and casually mentioning that due to a recent change in law the event will not longer be BYOB (uhh what???). Of course we understand this outcome is outside their control, but it would have been appreciated if BATL had disclosed the possibility of this happening prior to us making these plans. (Have I mentioned that this is for a large group of girls traveling from all over North America to celebrate a special occasion... Oh and that it was booked months ago?)\n\nNeedless to say we are out a lot of money that we used to pre order the alcohol for this event. We have also unwittingly signed up for a dry bachelorette event ... Thank you BATL for being so forthright with your information. Next time there is a law that threatens such a critical component and large appeal of your services, please disclose this pertinent piece of information.
