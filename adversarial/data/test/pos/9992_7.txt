These people manage my condo, and, after 8 years of them running my place, I am not impressed. A few incidents:\n\n1. I moved to my condo from university residence, but in the sale I did not receive a fob to get into my building. Since I couldn't wait, I called Royale Grande (which at the time was part of ICC), and the lady told me that, being a Saturday, the number was only for emergencies, not for issues with keys. When I told her that I couldn't wait until Monday, she told me that she wasn't going to argue and then hung up on me. When I called back to ask if she hung up on me, she said that she did and then hung up again.\n\n2. Annual condo meetings are monopolised by the property manager. When we get to 'other business' the meetings invariably end in a shouting match as unit owners raise issues and the property manager responds 'we're not going to discuss this at the meeting.' A couple of years ago, when an owner refused to be silenced, the manager threatened to call the police on him!\n\n3. If you call the manager with any repair order covered in the declaration, they first, always, tell you that it's your problem and you have to pay to get it fixed. When you correct them and cite the declaration, they say they will fix it. But they don't fix it. You write them month after month (since our property manager 'doesn't have a phone') asking for the fix and you keep being deferred to the following month.\n\nAt least they don't lie: their website talks a lot about offering services of managing contractors and emergencies, but they don't say anywhere that they care about unit-owner satisfaction.
