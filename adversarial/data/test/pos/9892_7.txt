We've been here enough times that I can update this review. This place is so damn good! Our last experience was a little disappointing because my boyfriend got a cross contamination allergy reaction but I blame us for that. We should have reminded them that he needs his sushi prepared away from any shellfish. We've basically tried all the sushi rolls that are without shrimp. All wonderful! They even told us we could always pick any roll we wanted and they could swap out the shrimp for another type of fish. Very cool. We'll be back for sure!
