I think the desserts here are nice to look at, worthy of any SWAG Las Vegas casinos\/hotel. \n\nIf you're a dessert consoeur, you'll have a great time here. They have the latest rage such as cronuts to a variety of booshie italian gelato. \n\nBeing an average joe myself, thumbs up for aways being open when I need my coffee fix.
