middling - fairly good but not very good\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you've ever wanted flavorful Chinese vegetarian food, this campy-cliched joint is for you (not so much me). Now, the vegetable curry with tamarind is tangy and pairs nicely with the crisp bun roll, and the cool indoor waterfall pond with artificial trees and frogs is cute. But yeah, has anyone else tried to order a 16oz ribeye medium rare or asked for avant-garde raw vegan dishes here? I couldn't find either here. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat my overall star ratings mean [girls]:\n\n5 = \"One time, she punched me in the face.
