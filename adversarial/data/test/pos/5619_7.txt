Go see this show!!!\nDope SHOW! Very interactive! Awesome music! Awesome dance plot! I got clowned on and this makes it every more FUN! You can get discounts on the strip or at the box office - if you have a Mlife card or you're staying at the Luxor! One mo time GO SEE THIS SHOW! \n\nThe boys from ABDC did their THANG! The movie and dancing scenes are all poised to get you hype! We had a blast! Singing and groving in our seats(I'm not a dancer). Ha ha!\n\nWe would def go see this show again if in Vegas! Two tickets cost us about $120 with Mlife discount! Jabbawockeez work hard and I appreciate everything the crew did to make our memories in Vegas unforgettable!
