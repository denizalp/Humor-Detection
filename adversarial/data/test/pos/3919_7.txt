This company is like a conglomerate in a 3rd world country - they are the government, your employer, your mother & father, and your end all say all.. and they breed new brood right over at the University not far from here.\n\nThe campus is really bizarre and interesting. It's as if the mad hatter designed it, and the whole campus, as far as what I've seen, has a Google'esque feel to it. I dig it, for sure.
