In the alley down some dark lit stairs is one of the coolest spots in the valley to get a drink. \n\nThe drinks, a little bit of a play on Arizona's Political history are pretty classy.\n\nI went with the \"The Rose\" Mofford which has Tito's vodka, Tempus Fugit Violette, Lemon Juice, Rose water & Simple syrup. This is a classy cocktail, makes you feel like a classy dame for drinking it. \n\nValley Bar has rooms within rooms, if you make it in to the reading room, check out some of the books, they are a wide variety and interesting finds. They have live music too.\n\nThe only downside, the ladies restroom, only one sink was working, and the 1st stall is in clear site of those who are outside of the restroom when the door opens. And the last step when coming down the stairs is a killer!
