What a MONEY MACHINE!\nLow end \"tables\" will run you about $4-5k\nHigh end cabanas will run you anywhere from $10-25k\n\nA bit ridiculous I must say. Drinks are $20-50, depending what you get. A small Fiji water bottle was $12! Ouch, Vegas!\n\nI honestly don't get what all the hype is for EBC. SUPER CROWDED and \"Chainsmoker\" doesn't even come out until 3:30-4pm for about 1-1.5 hour before the day club closes. Eh, I pass. \n\nI actually USED to think day clubs were better than night clubs, but I may have to rethink this. \n\nDay Club:\n1) HOTTTTTTT, freaking HOT in the summer (be warned--hydrate yourself. Heat + Alcohol can be a bad combo, so be careful!)\n2) Not much shade\n3) Pool water is so dirty \n4) The female bathroom has a HUGE line, so be prepare to wait for easily 15 minutes before your turn. \n\nHonestly, Vegas is not what it used to be 3-4 years ago. \n\nP.S. If you get a locker ($10-15), make sure to cover the code you set. My gfs got their lockers broken into!!! hmp!
