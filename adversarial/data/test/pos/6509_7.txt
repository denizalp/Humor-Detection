After our visit to The Warhol, we came here for The Rib Fest and Bret Michaels concert (the ladyfriend likes him, and it was a free show) and had a pretty good time. Bret Michaels didn't actually perform IN Heinz Field but rather on a stage outside of it. \n\nDid they have to tear down Three Rivers Stadium for this (and PNC Park), let alone trick us taxpayers into paying for it? \n\nI really don't know what else I could say about it. I for damn sure would rather watch a game at home or in a bar than come all the way down here to contend with drunken, obnoxious fans. \n\nI might come here to see a heavy-hitters concert, though. I'm still sad over missing the 1988 Monsters of Rock tour that stopped at Three Rivers 22 years ago. Maybe Metallica will do something similar here someday, like an all-day Big 4 Of Thrash Fest for instance?!?  I'd certainly prefer seeing something like that at Heinz Field than at Ye Olde Burgertown Pavilion. \n\nBut yeah it's spiffy enough, hence the 4 stars. They certainly spent some dough, our dough on it. Although at some point, the novelty HAS to wear off.
