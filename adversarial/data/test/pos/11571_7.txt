I had a strange experience coming here. Something I wouldn't expect from a high class restaurant. \n\nI was a walk in on a weekday during February. When I checked in upstairs, another guest came out of the restaurant wanting a different seat, I was told I was set and to take a seat by the elevators. People came in and out of the restaurant (I figured guests with reservations) and I waited about 20 mins until the host looked at me and said, \"Do you need help? Oh, no wait, you ate already\". I answered,  \"No, I checked in a while ago, you told me to sit here\". The host apologized and searched my name in the system not knowing what happened. I made the excuse for them, \"That guest that wanted different seats must have distracted the check in process, it happens\". So, they made a big deal to get me a \"good seat\" (by the window - at the hotel I was staying at... With a view I've seen several times on this trip...that I mentioned when I checked in).\n\nThe view was gorgeous none-the-less but as soon as I sat down, a waiter dropped a plate of food, picking up only the big pieces. \n\nI ordered a glass of wine, the Lobster Bisque and Steak and Lobster. \nThe Lobster Bisque was devine though some parts of the meat were cold while other parts were warm. And the steak and lobster was perfect as well. \n\nWhile I was eating, my water was never filled and a different waitress broke a wine glass (again, only picking up the big pieces). While enjoying the food and view all the waiters (3 in our area) are speaking on the different restaurant levels in Spanish rather loudly. \n\nWhen I was done, the waitress that broke the glass asked if I was done and when I said yes, she took my plate away which I thought was strange. I had quite a bit of food left and I felt like for a place like this, wasting food wouldn't be an option. (I would have loved to finish left overs!)\n\nWhile waiting for check, my waiter was bringing food to another table where he dropped the food cover. \n\nI thought this restaurant staff was VERY careless and I left uneasy about my experience.
