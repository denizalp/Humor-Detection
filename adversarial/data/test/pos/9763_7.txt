Don't do this to yourself. Don't be mean. Don't go to Whataburger at 1 in the morning. Especially at this location. Your punishment will be indigestive agony and general malaise for a long time afterwards.\n\nAnd if you do go and suffer the consequences, all I can say is, \"I told you so.\"\n\nBut why suffer?
