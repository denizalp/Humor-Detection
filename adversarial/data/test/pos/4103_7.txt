Why oh why would one eat here when there are so many other amazing burger and hit dog places around The Strip? Oh yeah, we had a Groupon.\n\nWe skipped the burgers and got a chili cheese hot dog (with bacon added), poutine fries, and regular fries (so we could try all the different ketchups). The hot dog was alright. Nothing near as good as say Pink's (which is also located in Planet Hollywood). It was big and thick and loaded with all the toppings. The chili was meh. The poutine fries were edible, but far from even qualifying as good. The regular fries were just frankly icky. The variety of ketchups was great and the maple bacon ketchup and hickory ketchup were standouts.\n\nIt's located in the Miracle Mile Shops. If you park in the shops parking garage, this is one of the first places you will see when you enter the shops.\n\nYou order at the counter, receive a number, and then take a seat of your choosing.\n\nThere's also a small bar area if you want to get an over-priced beer ($7 for a Stella).\n\nThe counter staffer was incredibly less than pleasant. She looked like she had just rolled out of bed and would rather be anywhere but there. \n\nWe arrived just before the dinner time rush. And with just one staffer to place and bring out orders, we could see our order sitting in the window for way too long. We finally went and got it ourselves. Not cool.\n\nAnd then a woman who I presume was a manager came out and started helping deliver the orders by yelling out the numbers instead of finding them. Not disruptive at all.\n\nAnd the music was definitely way too loud.\n\nAnd the food is definitely way over-priced for what you get.\n\nSo nope, we won't be dining here again.
