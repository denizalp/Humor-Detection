Great boutiques are few and far between, but Scout & Molly's is one of, if not my favorite, boutiques in Charlotte. To be completely upfront, there was a short span of four months or so when I worked an occasional weekend day here...but let's be honest...I didn't really make any money...I \"reinvested\" it all back into the store...for good reason!\n\nMegan, the owner, plucks some of the most chic and creative clothes and jewelry to showcase. You'll find brands like T Los Angeles, BB Dakota, Greylin, Seven For All Mankind, Alice & Trixie, Joy Joy, Joe's Jeans, etc. Plus, this is the only boutique in Charlotte that carries Rebecca Taylor. Sweet! Clothing prices can range considerably because the lines appeal to different markets. Make sure you check out the sale section, too - they are always deals to be had. \n\nThis shop certainly appeals to a variety of women - different ages, price points, styles, which I personally find really great. And...I always walk out of here with something (much to husband's dismay). The jewelery is all made my local or regional designers and is definitely on the affordable front. Expect *most* necklaces to run in the $30-$60 range, earrings $15-$35, cuffs and bracelets $20-$40. This is a general price range, folks, so I'm sure if you dig you will find a $15 pair of earrings or a $75 necklace. Jewelry brands include Murphy, Sylvia Benson, Lush, Towne & Reese & more. \n\nThe employees here (even outside of my short stint of reinvestment) are some of the nicest around. They will give you their honest opinion (if asked) and are happy to help you find whatever you need. Whether you're looking for a cocktail dress for a gala, a new top for a bachelorette party or a gift for your best friend, they will have you covered. I'll definitely be back here soon...happy shopping!
