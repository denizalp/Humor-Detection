No matter how quote unquote \"COOL\"  this played out adult Farris Wheel may look has anyone else noticed there are NO restrooms on these things?\n\nWhere do the people who drink too much go if they need to Puke? Behind a bar stool?  On my shoe?\n\nAnd am I the only person in the world who has a bladder the size of a dwarf chipmunk when they drink alcohol?  lol :)\n\nI don't know...peeing on one's self because you are trapped in a glass bubble doesn't exactly sound like a fun time to me! Neither does getting a yeast infection trying to hold in your 90% tequila urine for more than 10 minutes ladies!\n\nCall me old fashioned... but this lady prefers to keep a restroom handy when I'm out and about getting a royal Drunk On! And I can't be trapped in NO restroomless bubble! \n\nLook up the words \"Drunks.. Heights... and Trapped\" and it will instantly produce the word.... \"Accident\" :-\/
