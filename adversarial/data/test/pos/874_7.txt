Hearty diner food with good flavors. Nothing extraordinary. Limited menu. Was hoping for an Acai bowl or green drink but that's not this type of place. The real downer was the small dining space which was super noisy and not cozy. Hipster place with a rustic industrial\/farm decor. Overhyped but super popular with college crowd.  Friendly service:)
