Great location, beautiful decor. But thats about it. This is a totally different menu then any other CPK Ive ever been to. I came here for the sole purpose of having the amazing caramelized peach salad only to find out its not on the menu. I settled for a veggie salad and it was just ok. im not a huge fan of warm veggies on a semi cold lettuce bed. The bartender seemed to be very underwhelmed and i almost felt like I was a bother to her more then anything else. The manager behind the bar was very pleasant though, thats why Im giving 3 stars instead of two. \nAll in all I probably wont be back to this location because there are so many other places in DT Summerlin. Ill stick to the Town Square or Fashion Show locations.
