Don't waste your time and money!  We had to babysit the workers almost the entire time and remind them of what the plans\/contract said.  They never contacted our HOA or got the permits until we asked about it, even though this was to be completed two months prior.  We had a gas fire pit installed and they had 60feet of black pipe attached to our brand new home, without our approval.  When we asked about this we were told you wanted a permit, even though we were originally told the pipe would be buried. There was no communication on anything, every day we would come home to find things different than the plans showed. No response to half of our emails or phone calls. Also, they modified a contract after we signed it.  Overall, horrible experience and don't recommend.
