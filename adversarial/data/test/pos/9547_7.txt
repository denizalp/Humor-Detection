I've read the recent reviews and I was a bit worried to see comments about slow service, bad service, or lack of flavour.  I thankfully didnt see any of those issues creep here.  I saw all of those when I went to the Bloor St location but I would say of the 3 Freshs I've been to (Bloor, Spadinda, and Crawford), this one was the better experience.\n\nArriving on a Sunday brunch, we were able to book online a reservation and so we had no issues getting a table quickly.  I think it's not well known that they're on OpenTable for reservation.  It's super easy to book a spot that way.\n\nWith only 30 minutes after opening, the patio was nearly taken.  I think we took one of the last 2 tables.  The inside though... was bare!  Maybe only 3 tables were taken.  With the patio, it nearly doubles their capacity.  So if you see a line up out the door or crowding the front, take a peak... it might be people waiting for the patio in the summer.  You can score a table with zero wait inside. As for the seating, it's not so crowded on the patio.  Definitely busy and definitely full but there's enough space that you dont have to move tables to get out (like in Bloor).  As for the space itself, it's clean and open with a lot of shade.  You can be at the edge where it meets the sidewalk and you will have lots of sun.  That morning, they were still using the heater and I sat underneath it.  I was kept cozy as it was late spring.  \n\nService here was 3 times faster than the other 2 spots (Bloor and Spadina).  Though there was about 3 staff managing the patio, they kept the food coming in and out as they were trying to bring more and more of the line into the patio.  I dont think we waited terribly long for anything.  We might have waited a bit to order but it was no where as bad as the other 2 spots.  Maybe a little more than 10 minutes.  After our order, the app came in quickly with our salads and bowls shortly after.  I think your experience will heavily depend on how good your servers are... cause we got some terrible ones at Bloor but here, they're faster and more aware.\n\nBuffalo Cauliflower - This has to be my favourite app on the menu... I keep ordering it and there hasnt been a bad plate yet.  Tender cauliflower is battered then fried up crisp and dressed with a tangy hot sauce.  They always arrive hot and crispy.  Some people love the onion rings or the sweet potato fries... I always go for the cauliflower!  4\/5\n\nUltimate Falafel Salad - I tried this this a while ago and though I love all the vegetables they put into this, the falafels themselves were just ok.  They werent really crispy or hot... just kinda warm and a bit mushy.  They generously piled on the crispy onions, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, mint parsley, and cranberries on the salad base.  A nice drizzle of the tahini sauce just made things perk up in flavour.  Maybe I'll try a new salad next time but this still is one of the better ones I've tried.  3.5\/5\n\nTangled Thai - This was a nice colour salad with the spirals of carrots and beets.  They had also the purple cabbage, cucumbers, red peppers and tons of peanuts on top.  We did ask for few extra add ons and they gave a super generous amount.  Unlike some places where they only give you 1 tbsp... they pile it on.  So never feel like the extras are a waste of money.   The peanut citrus sauce was a good way to add more nutty flavour to the salad.  4\/5\n\nI think Fresh can be hit and miss but this particular Sunday, they were much better than usual.  I think if you arrive before the crazy rushes you'll have a better experience.  Sunday brunch seems like a good time to hit the patio if you want.
