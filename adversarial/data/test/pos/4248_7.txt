I love coming here for my monthly Asian snack fix!\n\nThat have new owners now, the same folks that own Sweet Asian Bakery also owns the grocery store which is a welcoming change since now the bakery selection is hugely vast. I picked up three assortment of buns for $2.99.\n\nI've always gotten the freshest vegetables here. Some are cheaper than Woodmans... Woodmans! For example, grapes here were $1.89\/lb whereas Woodmans wanted $3.99\/lb! \n\nIf you're feeling adventurous say, to organize your own hot pot party, they sell a dozen different varieties of frozen fish balls!\n\nThey carry all the needs for your traditional Asian household.
