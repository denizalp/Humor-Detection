Well I attempted to try out this new place. It was a Thursday night.  We were going to watch cirque du soleil, which was indescribably amazing, and got turned away at the door of savoy along with the couple next in line for not having a jacket on by the extremely rude shorthaired woman at the door. I was informed that the place was empty by the person who I was meeting inside. I wonder why???  I won't even think of that place ever again and I'm taking the owners card out of my wallet. It's too phat and too fat. The term is \"reality check\". The best of luck to all at savoy!
