I love a trip to Four Peaks! Been coming here for years now! \n\nDelicious food, craft beers, enjoying the company of your friends ... What more could you ask for? \n\nIn the fall, I find myself here more often as that's when they bust out the Pumpkin Porter. It's even more delicious in a shake . . . Impossible?! \n\nThe Bleu Light Special Burger is my favorite burger on the menu. Get it with the beer battered fries; they're to die for.\n\nI also love the Five Layer Nacho Dip with Chicken. Just make sure you bring an Army with you (four or more of your buds), because the portion size is ginormous. \n\nThe Brickhouse Wings are just OK. \n\nStill need to try the legendary Salmon BLT!\n\nBring your growler - Trust me, you'll want to bring some beer home. \n\nThe only downside is, they can't fill growlers with Oatmeal Stout (love this one the most out of all their beers ) - something about it not keeping fresh. :( \n\nMake sure you bring a DD. Drunk driving is for dumbasses who want to get tossed around Tent City like a box of Girl Scout Cookies.\n\nDon't be deterred from a trip to Four Peaks because of all the ASU youngins - There's good times and even better brews to be had for (legal aged) folks young and old!
