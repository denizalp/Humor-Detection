Stopped in there for a drink before dinner elsewhere in the Market and was charmed by the sparkly vinyl chairs, old school diner booths and excellent people watching from the front window. It's larger inside that I thought it would be, so despite being claustrophobic, I might come back here even if it was busy.\n\nAlthough decidedly hipster-ish, it's dive-y charm makes it a place that I might frequent. Hipsters aren't bad people and I don't feel bad making jokes at their expense because hipsters don't know they're hipsters, so I'm assuming there's no offense taken.
