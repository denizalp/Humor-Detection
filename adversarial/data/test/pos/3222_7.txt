If they had more Breakfast Pizza, 5 stars . . . \n\nWe made it to the Bellagio for brunch on my sister's recommendation and loved it so much we ended up going for a second day.  First off, for a $15 brunch with some quality foodie options in the beautiful Bellagio, it's hard to beat.  The first day, we got there a little late.  Damn late monorail!  The second day, we got a seat right next to the buffet and oinked our way back for seconds and thirds.\n\nCoffee and juice are complimentary with the buffet, and the dishes that really stood out were:\n\n-Eggs benedict. (not just for weekends only!)\n-Breakfast pizza - basically, pizza with egg baked into it.  Fantastic!\n-Potatoes O'Brien - get some veggies in there\n-Omelettes, although the line was a little long\n-Breakfast burrito bar\n-Scones, mini belgian waffles, and an assortment of fruit\n\nThe Bellagio is a solid value for brunch, and I would probably make this your first brunch here before you venture to one of the other buffets.  No idea what dinner was like, but it sounds fantastic, but a dinner buffet is dangerous, I like to travel light at night.
