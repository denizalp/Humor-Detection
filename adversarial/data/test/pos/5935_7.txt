I'm so disappointed with the staff at the Gastonia, NC location (#3606). I arrived at 7:56 tonight to purchase a grill. I knew exactly which one I wanted after researching them online, so it would've been a quick purchase. I was excited to have my husband put it together tonight before he leaves out of town for the next week, but I did not get that opportunity. Yes, I'm aware that the location closes at 8:00PM tonight, but as I said, I knew exactly what I was getting. There was a staff member outside who politely reminded me that they will close soon, I told him that it was not a problem, I knew exactly what I'm getting. He said okay. After I walked into the UNLOCKED door, an older, female employee ran over from the customer service desk and told me they were closed and I could not come in. I told her that the guy outside didn't say you were closed and that it is still not quite 8:00 yet. Her reply to me was that it didn't matter because they were already closing their registers so I couldn't buy anything anyway. While I was extremely irritated, I didn't want to sit there and argue with this employee and so I just left as she was forcing me to do. I see a few problems here- 1) How can you close a store before closing time? Yes, I know it's only 4 minutes, but still, it wasn't closed. The door was even still open and functioning. 2) How do you shut down your registrars when there are still other patrons in the store? Do you just tell them tough luck, you weren't checked out in time? 3) Clearly, you aren't going to close the resisters while there are still people in the store, so this lady LIED to me. Sure, it may have been an easy answer and a way to force me to leave, but the point is, it is completely UNACCEPTABLE to lie to a customer. It seems to me that this employee needs some additional training or the store in general needs to review it's closing procedures and customer service policies.
