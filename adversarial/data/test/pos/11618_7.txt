I had a lunch meeting here and was so impressed by how fresh their food is! I ordered the Kale Salad w\/chicken and oh my goodness, it was delish! It probably could have had a little bit more chicken but hey, i'll take what I can get! I loved the beets (that is what sold me) and the citrus dressing. I also want to come back and try the Farmer's Market Salad (I hear that it has lots of yummy dips for the veggies and being a sauce freak, that sounds heavenly!). I love the overall vibe of this place and will definitely be back soon!
