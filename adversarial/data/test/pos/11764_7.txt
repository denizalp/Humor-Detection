The Glendale Westgate District is as mainstream as it gets when it comes to delivering dining options. I am a deep believer in not going to places when I'm out of town that I could enjoy within the proximity of my area. But Glendale left me no option.\n\nYou know what you're getting at the Yard House. It is a level above your Chili's and TGI's. Decent bar food, okay happy hour, half yard drinks, and then you let the service dictate the rest. \n\nThe service here was okay, they had a server shift switch but I am glad it happened because our 2nd server was much better. Their only slip up was them leaving me waiting for water. If Bobby Boucher can serve up high quality h20 why can't you?\n\nThe facility is well kept, restrooms are spacious, their TV game is lacking a bit from what I'm used to from the location in Oxnard, of all places. \n\nThe Yard House is quite predictable. If you've never been to one I suggest you do, just like me, you won't mind it for when there are no better options.
