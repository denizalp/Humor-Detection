When I read the great reviews of my yelp buffet lunch group for this place (yes, this review is for the lunch buffet), I knew I had to come here; and I'm glad I did. The restaurant is bigger than it looks from the outside, and inside it is clean and the service is very friendly. The buffet items were all good - several types of curries, two kinds of pad thai, rice and noodle dishes - including my favorite, beanthread noodles. Chicken and tofu are the predominant proteins in the buffet, but there's also a beef curry for those who must have their bovine fix. Also, there were a number of tasty vegetarian options. The heat level of spicy dishes was low to moderate, though there is a condiment area with sauces and peppers that will allow you to crank your food's heat level up to thermonuclear, if you so desire. All this really good food for just $8.88 plus tax.  The lunch buffet here is definitely one of the best dining deals in the city.
