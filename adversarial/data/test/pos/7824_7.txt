This Y is the closest for me - but I wish it would step up its game! The TVs on the fitness equipment rarely work- they are usually fuzzy, have no sound, or are not connected to cable at all. These should be easy fixes but haven't been addressed for the nearly three years I have been attending. \n\nThe group fitness classes are typical- spin, group power (fake Les Mills Body Pump), yoga, etc. Some instructors are talented but others seem to be caught up in their own social circles, gossiping during class. The members partake in this behavior and can be disruptive and rude. But, the instructors fail to address these students because they are 'friends'. Very annoying. \n\nThe personal trainers look disengaged or tired. I'd skip this service if I were you. \n\nLocker rooms are fine- nothing wrong but nothing special. \n\nApparently this location just got a new director. Be careful- she is already instituting meaningless changes like no sitting on a stool at the front desk. Big deal! Fix the equipment!! She came from the Chris Town location- totally different focus from Scottsdale. Whatever lady - just fix the machines.
