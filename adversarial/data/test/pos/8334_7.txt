When I was young, my family would come to Pier W and Swingos for brunch when there were important goings on. I have not been to Pier W in quite some time. I usually go to Pier Z (Lake House Cafe) as it is more budget friendly with the same view. Pier W is definitely more of a special occasion type of place. I would not say a first date place because if you are honest with yourself, a first date is not worth spending a truck load of money on. At least in my world. Respect needs to be gained. You could be breaking bread one day and a stranger the next. There is an extremely fickle populous on planet Earth. This is the Age of Aquarius and waterside dining does seem appropriate. First dates are best reserved for the Lido. Then you can gauge commitment and if they are truly down to ride or die. The happy hour is one of the best in the city. Seating can be tight so try to arrive early.
