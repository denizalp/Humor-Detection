Their highly touted hainan chicken rice lives up to the hype.  However, the rest of the menu is just ok.  You should stick with their chicken rice.\n\nFirst of all, the chicken rice is very tender and the rice soaks up the flavor, this is a top notch dish and worth the wait.  Their ginger dipping sauce hits the spot.  The only complaint is that the portion is small, like a larger appetizer, so don't come hungry.  Perhaps an extra chicken add on for a few more dollars?\n\nThe fried chicken tenders was a little disappointing.  The outside was nice and crispy, the inside was very moist.  The only problem is that it's way too salty and dipping into the provided sauces makes this worse.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the jook or chicken congee.  This is not done the traditional way, the texture was off, the bean sprouts and pickled veggies just didn't work. Why don't they use a traditional recipe and use their high quality chicken and this certainly would be a big hit?\n\nNote that the restaurant is hard to find and not in good neighborhood, going here only for lunch is high advisable.  When on Sahara, look for Tam street, it's in the small strip mall.  Also, it's a really small space, so only a few tables are available.
