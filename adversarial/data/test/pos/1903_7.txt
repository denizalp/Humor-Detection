I have to say, I was pretty impressed by this museum. I'm not usually a \"spend all day at a museum\" person but this place had so much to offer, you almost couldn't spend less than 2 hours (my usual attention span) here.  In fact, we ended up spending about 3.5 hours here and that's only because we had somewhere else to be that evening.\n\nI feel like in some of their exhibits they had almost TOO much stuff, especially the little tchotchkes in some of the various sections of the museum.  We could have probably done without the animal floor with the exception of the dinosaur fossils.  I overheard someone say some of the fossils were genuine, some were not.  But they were pretty amazing.\n\nMy favorite exhibit was probably the ancient Egyptian section.  The real mummy was creepy and awe-inspiring all at once.\n\nWe also checked out the Evidence Room exhibit, which was an architectural exhibit of Auschwitz.  It turned out to be smaller than I expected but was equal parts chilling\/compelling and difficult to view.  Everything was in white and hard to read.  As small as the exhibit was, only an even smaller part of it held my attention.\n\nThere was some construction going on so that sort of detracted from our ability to take a good picture outside though the building itself was gorgeous from what we can see.  Part old, part new, super gorgeous.  Our sympathies go out to the gift shop staff who have to put up with the loud racket for another few months.\n\nDefinitely a must-visit when you're in town.  I recommend you look at the summary of the exhibits and plot out your priorities.  There's a lot to get through and if you're the diligent type, you'll want all the time you can get!
