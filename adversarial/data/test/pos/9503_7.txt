21 different burgers with a variety of protein choices, fries, and milk shakes what could go wrong. On my first trip not much. I had the bacon cheesy burger and fries. My daughter had the grilled cheese off the kids menu which used slider buns for the bread and it was delicious! \n\nThere are a number of dipping sauces to choose from for the fries or to add to your burger. Next time I'll get the sweet potato fries so I can try the toasted marshmallow sauce with them. \n\nThe kids lived their shakes too. Service was quick. Of course with all these fast casual places where you order at the counter and pay, get your own drink etc what the heck do you tip?
