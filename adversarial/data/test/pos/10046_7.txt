So since I can't review them separately this is For the Frog AND The Whiskey attic.\n\nIn most cases this would be a 5 star dive bar. They have almost any beer you could ever want and many you have never heard of. The staff, for the most part, knows more about beer than your average brewery employee and can guide you through the menu with ease.\nThere is a good jukebox, and with the high ceilings it is a great place frequently see FREE live music.\nI've only eaten here once, and I had the Chilli, which I'm pretty particular about and there's definitely hits the spot, served  in a big bowl and heavy enough to satisfy your stomach and hold up to a night of beer sampling.\nThe rest of menu is typical bar food favorites like burgers, wings, fries, nachos, etc.\n\nThe Whiskey Attic is the place where a whiskey fanatic's dreams come true. When I first walked through the door and entered the room I felt like Howard Carter breaking through the wall into Tut's tomb.\nIt's not open all the time and to get up there you basically have to request it from the staff, usually when Adam is there. On both occasions I've been he took our group up to see it and give us a rundown of the place. \n\nBut....like I said this WOULD be a 5 star, except for one factor. \nPRICES!\nGo during happy hour and take advantage. Some of these items are understandably high because they are limited, seasonal, or specially imported...but trust me I know how much beer costs...especially here in Las Vegas. And the reason I'm not a frequent patron (even though I like the place) is that in that atmosphere with that location everything is 10-20% higher than its competition and demographic.\nSo...If for example I want a Huckleberry Finn Nut Brown Bourbon Ale or a 23 year old whiskey that I just can't get anywhere else, the Frog\/Whiskey Attic is where I'll go.\nOr if I'm on campus around happy hour I'll stop in for a quick one. But otherwise this place will be my favorite place that I never go.
