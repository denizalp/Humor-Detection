Another good meal, Five Guys Burgers & Fries are consistent regardless of the location.  Their burgers are similar to old school backyard burgers with a good size patty and fresh fixings, but their meat is a tad greasy.  \n\nWhat makes them unique is how they make your burger to order, they let you pick your toppings, which are all fresh.  Their fries are amazing! Love the seasonings that they put on them.  \n\nThis location is clean and the staff was all friendly, bathrooms are also clean and well stocked.  \n\nThis is a chain with pride, you will enjoy your experience.  WARNING: if you have peanut allergies, I'd consider another option.  The fries are cooked in no allergenic peanut oil, BUT, they have peanuts all over the restaurant, they offer FREE salted peanuts, which are very good, but also not ideal for some people.
