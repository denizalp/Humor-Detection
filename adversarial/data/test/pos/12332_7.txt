We came for a vacation in Las Vegas and greatly enjoyed our resort stay.  Yardbird is located in the Venetian within a short distance from our room which was extremely convenient for folks like us with limited transportation.\n\nWe arrived just before our reservation time and this spot was extremely busy and poppin, especially for a weekday.  There were several people at the bar and many tables were filled with happy, social, and nice casually dressed folks.  People here were just lively and we just really like the atmosphere.  If you're into the contemporary country decor look, this would be the place Joanna Gaines can appreciate or the likes there of.\n\nWe were seated in the main eating area, just a little beyond the bar and our waitresses were on point.  They explained the menu in detail and made some great recommendations.  If you're a huge fried chicken fan, I would suggest the chicken & waffles.  There's a little surprise with the watermelon that comes along on the side of your dish but I appreciated the sweetness.  We also ordered the herb chicken and crunchy brussels sprouts.  Our waitress recommended the brussels and they were fabulous!  For real, for real!  I loved the lightness, the crunchiness, and the sweetness to every bite!  As for my herb chicken, I was a little disappointed, my chicken was not tender but the brussels were so amazing it basically made up for it.\n\nA great lively spot for anyone!  Great dishes and awesome service!
