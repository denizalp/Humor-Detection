ALL OF THESE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FAKE!!! BEWARE PEOPLE!\n\nI was fooled by these fake reviews here on Yelp and took my family here for dinner buffet last night.  There was a longggg line... and it made me excited because it must be good.  We actually paid $35 per adult and $20 per kid because it was supposed to be a special meal for Thanksgiving.  Even make me more excited.... However... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!   The foods were like crap.  Selection was soooo little.  Everyone in my family was angry.  Most of the guests (probably hundreds or even thousands of there) in there were angryyy...\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!!!  FAKE REVIEWS!!!
