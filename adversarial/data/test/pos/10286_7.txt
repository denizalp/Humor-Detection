Expensive for a burger that was not the best. \n\nBURGER:\nMy boyfriend ordered the SHAKE SHACK DOUBLE which he described the meat to be juicy, the melted cheese was great but did he didn't taste the shake shack sauce if there was any. He expected a stronger taste. But overall a good burger for him. \n\nI ordered the SMOKE SHACK DOUBLED. The first bite into it was great but after a few bites it was plain to me so I stopped eating. \n\nFRIES: \nMe: too salty for my taste\nHim: the crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and they don't get soggy right away \n\nENVIRONMENT: \nThe vibe is great. There are TV screens that run sport programs which is a plus in my book. Welcoming environment and makes you want to stay. \n\nI would like to try the one in NYC for the authentic feel.
