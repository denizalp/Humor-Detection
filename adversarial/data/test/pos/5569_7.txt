This is the Target I visit whenever I need to by hygiene stuff or movies or popcorn or whitey tighties, or whatever!  It's the closes one to me.  \n\nThe location is always clean, organised, well kept, and the workers are always friendly, helpful and overall decent to deal with.  The parking lot is huge, plenty of spots to park, I wish they had more trees for shade though.  \n\nThe restroom was always clean, well kept, with plenty of high quality  toilet paper.  The toilet is of quality here, much more powerful than a common house toilet.  If not on guard you could lose a leg to it.  You could easily triple flush with these toilets.  \n\nOverall a great Target, and I always have a great experience when I visit here.  They have a good toy section too.
