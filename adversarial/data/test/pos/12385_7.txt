Lunch with the girls\n\nShared duck confit pizza, Cesar salad and lasagna with a pitcher of white sangria.\n\nThe duck confit pizza was interesting because it's something I never seen made\nThat was used as a pizza topping but it wasn't so bad. Some duck confit,\nGreens and freshly grated cheese. The lasagna was made tasty and good size.\nVery soft and fully flavor. Nothing special with the salad a typical Cesar salad that you can't go wrong with. Topped the whole meal together with freshly light white sangria was yummy!
