Beat Niq drips of cool. Like the kind of cool you expect to find in 40s jazz places, with pinstripes, leopard print and an entrance through the kitchen with a door off the alley.\n\nSometimes when I walk into Beat Niq, I feel like the staff should address me as 'doll' and that something is about to 'go down'. This makes me glad to sit at a tiny table in a cramped basement bar, sip a hellava Belvedere martini and generally feel extra smooth.\n\nThe bands are always entertaining, and because the space is so small, it's very intimate. You feel like you're grooving right there on stage with the brass and bass.\n\nOn a particularly interesting side note, the owner both looks and sounds like Frank Sinatra; so if by some miracle of science you can swing tickets to a Frank show, don't pass it up. The music is very good and you will not regret it. (Also, bring me).\n\nAs mentioned, Beat Niq is small, so unless you can get Pic Niq (the delicious restaurant upstairs) to reserve you a table after your dinner, be sure to get there early. There is also a cover charge; be prepared to pay cash to get in. This give you the chance to practice something persuasive to say while you had over the bill like, 'my good friend the Queen Elizabeth thinks me and my pals are getting in here tonight...'.\n\nBeat Niq is cool, it's groovy and you'll love the martinis. Try as you might, you may not be able to resist the urge to say, 'Hey Mac, can I get a Mark's on ice?' to the barman.\n\nT.
