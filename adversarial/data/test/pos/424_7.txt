We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Colleen. She was very attentive and we had  a great meal. The menu is so extensive with many ,many options. I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast. They were both delish!     Their Potatoes are fab!!   The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well. We will defiantly come back here soon.
