The good: They have a large menu with tempting descriptions.\n\nThe bad: if you go on a group prepare to wait, and wait, and wait.\n\nThe ugly: we found a maggot on one of the dishes, another got his order all mixed up.\n\nI don't mind that much anymore if a place ENFORCES a group tip, but at least be CONSCIOUS that your working team DOES deserve the tip. For the service and the LOOONG wait we had, it doesn't make much sense to leave more tip.
