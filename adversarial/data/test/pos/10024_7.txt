Wow! I'd give zero if I could.....service was horrible. Slow, wrong beer, wrong orders all around....took over 30 minutes to get our food and at that point I had to finally ask for our food and miraculously it was ready....all of it....\n\nThe manager didn't seem to know how to handle unsatisfied customers....\n\nThey cooked our order again....the bartender ended up taking care of us toward the end of our visit and she was the only one on top of anything...\n\nThe manager said the hold up had to do with the \"crowd\"....mind you it's after 10pm and the bar area is the only thing open and there's less than 20 people in here....likely inexperienced - Native needs to step it up, they aren't the only wing place in the valley anymore....
