I like pad thai.\nI really do.  \nAnd that is about as much as I know about thai food.\nThat being said, I do like Touch of thai.  The staff is always friendly and the food is always tasty.\nHowever, there are two shrimp on my pad thai.  Only one when my husband takes his shrimp that I am pretty sure were written into our vows when we wed.  \nIt went something like... \"In sickness and health, to always give me a shrimp off your plate, till death do us part\"\nAnyway, a couple more wouldn't kill them.\nAlso, the place is kind of.... well.... run down?  The decor is a bit out of date, there are strange stains in strange places.... the bathroom is....well, not nearly as bad as a gas station in Blythe, but not awesome either.\nBut, the food is good. A little mild, come on guys I can handle it.
