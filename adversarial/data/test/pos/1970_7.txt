The family and I decided to try some Japanese noodles nearby so we picked out this place.\nThe place is very clean and decorative with Japanese decors. \nI picked the tonkatsu miso ramen and it was mediocre due to the salty broth.\nOverall this place has great customer service but the saltiness of the food will keep me away for some time.
