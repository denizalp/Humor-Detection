For those of you pining for the threat of violence with your disposable lunch, this is the location for you! Situated in the heart of the burgeoning Fashion District, but still retaining some of Queen West's \"olde-timey\" local colour, this KFC\/Taco Bell location at first beguiles with its anachronistic, chalet-facade (surprisingly unmarked by graffiti) and array of inexpensive offerings.  However, less than two minutes into my repast (I sat at the less-dirty of the two window tables, hoping for a quick exit), a lumbering street local bounded into the store, only to be taunted by a cohort outside.  Some pounding on the window ensued, and the lumbering one headed for the exit, frightening a woman and her toddler presumably waiting for the washroom to be vacated.  He turned at the fire exit, headed back towards me, only to be blocked by the man from outside. Swearing and pushing erupted, the smaller man landing in the chair opposite me. The larger man then returned to the fire exit, further terrifying the (still waiting) mother and child, and exited onto Augusta, triggering the alarm.  The thing is, the staff took a good LONG time to investigate--presumably, the whine of the claxon is a recurring element of their work day?  As for the food?  It was my first Taco Bell combo in more than a decade--and it utterly failed to deliver the forbidden tang I would expect from Yum! Brands. Didn't I read somewhere that Gidget the Chihuahua died of a stroke?
