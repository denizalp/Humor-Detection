When i go to Vegas and i want to go out for a Nice Dinner, Bouchon is the place. You will be looking at a $100 for about 2 people, but why not spend it eating then loosing it at the Craps Tables. What i try to do is win gambling, and i call the meal a Comp from the Hotel.  \n\nIf you are opened to trying new things, and dont care about what it is try the \"faugra\" (Duck Liver). Yes i know duck liver sounds good, but seriously it is like the best butter on your toast. \n\n$50 for 2-oz Jar of this stuff and you spread it on a type of toasted bread. All I have to say is \"Thank You Venetian for Dinner\" Just won $400 at the Craps Tables and wanted to find a way to give the money back to the hotel and casino. \n\nI am not a oyster guy, but i hear they are awesome here. Try there Slow Roasted Chicken and dont forget to get the fries (Trust Me)
