After a dinner in DTLV, we stopped in to say hello to BF's favorite bartender (TREY) and get to sample his famous Negroni drink.\n\nWe arrived for a private (not-so-private cuz we were able to attend) party of some reality TV's show's premier. There were about 30-some ppl in the theater and bar area --- who knew that behind those curtains was a screening room. Otherwise the Wayfarer is a small establishment that seats about 15 or less. \n\nIt's intimate décor reminds me of a speakeasy with curtains and plush furniture. A place where everybody knows your name. \n\nPièce de résistance for me was that the \"best bartender in Vegas\" plays the best music -EVER- ala his personal iPod. After 10:30pm, Trey plays hip hop. Not Drake or Little Wayne, we talking Craig Mack and Junior Mafia. The music I grew up with in the 90's!!!! THAT, along with the great mixologist drinks just screaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmms a great time!\n\nWith the growing number of \"hipster\" bars in Downtown, this is hands down my favorite!
