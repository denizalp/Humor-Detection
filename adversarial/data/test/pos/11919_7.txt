Why is a cheapskate like me shopping at AZ Tile?  Well, the Tempe location has many secrets - secret deals that is.  OK, so they're not that secret, but if you've been to the other locations you're just looking a gorgeous displays of lovely tile and solid surface slabs.\n\nBut at the Tempe location, this is where the extra unwanted slightly mismatched, or maybe slightly marred items go on sale.  Venture outside past the rows of gorgeous slabs on the inside and you hit the huge outside yard filled with sale slabs.  \n\nI bought a bunch of their Samsung Radiance Quartz on sale - because it wasn't up to Samsung's standards.  The errors were circled in pencil, and they were tiny and easy to work around.  Thank you picky Samsung!\n\nThe marble and granite slabs are also a deal out in the yard.  You have to look around, but you'll be happy.\n\nAnd then there are the secret tile deals!  I seriously have been coming to this place for years and had never been back past the Tile Sales desk (go through the pretty Tile sales room, past the lovely bathrooms, past the slab room and desk where you get your hard hats, keep walking back through the doors and you hit the Tile Sales desks.  OK, go past the Tile Sales desks and outside.  Wahlah!  Strange and wonderful short supply items in tile.  I've never bought any of this tile - too strange mostly :).  But there are some serious deals out there if there's something you want.    Last time I was out there, there were some huge pieces of granite that had been slabs that were cut into 'tiles' for some special order.   Really wild stuff.\n\nSo yes, it is true I buy most of my tile down the street at Floor and Decor.  But if you either want something special tilewise, or you want some sale slabs Arizona Tile is the place.
