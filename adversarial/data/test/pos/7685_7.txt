This place is a hidden gem. Walked in randomly with some friends. Friendly staff members not to mention cool decor. Their Garlic chicken wings and sweet and spicy wings are on point as well as their Garlic fries with an egg on top and seaweed ads the Asian zing. Ask for Dabin. We didn't even sing. It's a karaoke bar...
