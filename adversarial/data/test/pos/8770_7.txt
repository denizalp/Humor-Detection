I stopped at SW last night wth my Babe and had a fabulous dinner at SW.  We arrived at 7 were seated a great table in the main dining room where we could check out the restuarant.  The place was packed for a Mon night.  Although we were at the rear of the restauarant, we could still see the Wynn Fountains and the bright lights that echoed off the water.  The decor and ambience is utter luxury and glam......just like the rest of the Wynn Hotel....very romantic.\n\nAfter we ordered our Whiskies, we looked at the menu and decided to go with the Steak Tartare; 12 oz Bone-in Filet; Corn Puree and the Panna Cotta for desert.\n\nThe Steak Tartare was awesome.....full of beef flavor that was so freaking satisfying......almost as a good as a BJ.  I could have left after the appetizer and have been completely happy.\n\nThe Filet and Corn were also excellent...very tasty.  The Filet was prepared a perfect medium-rare and was sooooo good.  The Steak and Corn flavors melted very well together.\n\nThe Panna Cotta came with a Mango Sorbet ands was out of this world.\n\nThe service staff was OUTSTANDING!!!!!\n\nWe were waited on hand and foot all night.\n\nOverall, the BEST Steakhouse in Las Vegas...its a tie with Gordon Ramsay!
