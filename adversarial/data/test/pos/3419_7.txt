I stayed here for 2 nights on business and found this hotel to be an upgrade over most \"business hotels\" in town. There's no casino here, just fyi. \n\nHere are some pros:\n-Clean and inviting lobby\n-Clean room with a comfortable bed\n-They have a bar and a restaurant\n\nHere are some cons:\n-Shower was kinda dirty looking\n-There wasn't a full length mirror in the room \n-A futon was super stained and dirty\n\nOverall, I wouldn't stay here for pleasure, but I'd pick this hotel for business over a \"La Quinta\" or similar properties all day, every day!
