Amazing customer service!\nFantastic food! \nQuick service! \n\nI just literally finished eating here. Couldn't wait to do this review. I had the Harvest Special. 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, home fries, toast and pancakes. Obviously I couldn't finish it all but I tried really hard cause it was so good. \n\nThe home fries are beyond words. Potatoes and bacon bits done to golden perfection. The sausages were delicious. My sunny side up eggs were perfect  Basically, come here for brunch. You will not be disappointed. :)\n\nOur waitress was great. She was fast and came and checked up on us on a regular. Refilled my coffee. Brought us water without us asking.\n\nThis place is a hidden treasure that I am happy my friend found. Coming back here again soon!
