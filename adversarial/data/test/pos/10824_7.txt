Bagel expert from NY reporting that these bagels are smaller, but still a good eat. They fall somewhere below my favorite Valley place, but are worthy if your in the area. I grabbed eight at a buck apiece and they have all the trendy flavors, including cornmeal and cheddar, etc. The place is tiny, but the price of a sandwich is large. At least $10.50 for nearly every sandwich. They don't use Boars Head, nor do they make their own meat and the photos of the sandwiches look small, so they must be charging North Scottsdale prices. I mean, at least Chompie's is worth the price for what you get right? Just preference, but I would also prefer a person more representative of the cuisine or the area to take my order.
