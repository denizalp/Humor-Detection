Amazing food, terrible service\n\nI usually order 2 chipotle shrimp tacos (SO GOOD) and load it up with some salsas from their big salsa bar, and surprisingly 2 is enough to keep me full! However my most recent trip here is the reason why they are not receiving a 5-star :\/\n\nLast Thursday my girlfriends and I were looking for some late night eats close by and saw Serrano's was still open. Having eaten here numerous times before and loving the food we decided to go here. We arrived at 9:30 and I immediately approached the cashier lady since I always get my usual Chipotle Shrimp tacos. Now I'm not all anal about being greeted and all that jazz but I pretty much greeted myself to this girl and started telling her my order. As I was saying, \"I want Chipotle Shrimp tacos\" She interrupted me in this rude tone and said \"Is this gonna be to-go cuz like were gonna close in 10 minutes.\" First of all, there was plenty of time for me and my girls to down 2 tacos each under 30 mins, and second of all, it was 9:30, you close in 30 minutes, not 10 but I don't make the rules. I then agreed to take it to-go and then we had an awkward silence and I thought she was waiting for me to order more and so I said \"Well, that's it\", completing my order. She gave me a dirty look like \"That's it what? Like what are you talking about, you didn't even tell me anything\" like I was stupid or something. Fcking HELL NAH. First of all if you weren't so focused on what time you were getting off MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ME WHEN I ASKED FOR 2 SHRIMP TACOS. Freaking rude. If you know me, I'm too nice to say anything like this in person but just typing this review out makes me wish I had said something.\n\nOverall she was just giving off terrible vibes. You could tell this girl hates her job and just wants to get off, which is fine but don't take it out on your customers. She could have said things in a nicer way but that's in a perfect world. It's because of service like this, I will not return as often as I'd like, no matter how good their food is. And I seriously love their food, I would recommend the food. But watch out for cranky cashier girl!
