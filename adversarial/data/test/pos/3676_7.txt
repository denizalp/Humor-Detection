Stayed here a few years ago and absolutely loved it.  Now?  What the heck happened - just checked in, and I'm wondering if they could have gotten any shabbier?  Room smells musty, and, as the pictures show - it looks like the furniture is from a third hand thrift shop, or went through a war zone.j\n\nThis room is worn out, and looks like it was beaten with the shabby stick.  It would also be so very nice if all the light bulbs, you know, actually produced light.  Oh, and the dead bugs in the overhead light - perfection!\n\nFlamingo - what happened?  Seriously disappointed and embarrassed that I brought my wife here. Probably won't be back.
