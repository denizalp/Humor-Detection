This is my go-to lunch spot in downtown, LV! The service is typically very good, the food is phenomenal and the decor is Industrial\/Modern. \nThe Oxtail Risotto is one of the best dishes on the menu! I can't say enough about how delicious it is! (Must try)\nI also really enjoy their tri-color Cauliflower...its saut√©ed with lemon and spices! So good and good for you! \n\nThe service is great if you sit at the bar...\n\nOh! And, their Gin and Tonic is SPOT ON! lol
