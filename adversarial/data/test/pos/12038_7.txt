We booked a test drive with Hyundai and really enjoyed the new 2013 Elantra GT. The sales rep was funny, friendly and extremely knowledgable. He also waived all the upfront fees that other dealerships were charging ($1000 to start). We did our research and felt this rep was giving us the best deal, so we purchased the GT.\n\nThe only concern we had was getting in touch with the dealership regarding our paperwork with insurance after we purchased the car. I understand our original sales rep was off sick, but no one wanted to take ownership and help on his behalf. Reception was very short and rude on the phone and we kept getting asked if we wanted his voicemail even though we explained we received a call to pick up the vehicle the following day with no instructions with regard to paperwork, as our insurance company required documentation that we could only get from the dealership. \n\nAt the end, our finance rep helped us with the insurance. However, to get the help we needed we had to make several calls, emails and voicemails. There needs to be a better back-up system for reps that are unavailable. Reception also needs to be a little nicer to customers. We are first time car buyers and didn't know the process. Patience and a little more explanation would have been appreciated. \n\nOther than that, Charles Noh sold us with his charisma and professionalism. The finance rep Abdul Rahman was also very accommodating, and quite amusing. He sold us the extended warranty for 84 months and we're quite pleased as he also provided a weekly payment schedule that we were originally told wasn't possible. \n\nIf it weren't for Mr. Noh and Mr. Rahman's services, we would likely have been put off with our overall experience.
