Vegas is about glamourous hotels and trendy clubs. But when your feet refuse another night of suffering in high heels yet you still want to get your party on, you go to Carnival Court Bar.\n\nWhere else can you... \n1) watch bartenders do flairs and tricks?\n2) enjoy a live band singing and rocking out to radio hits? They're very good btw. \n3) relive moments of MJ's legacy? It wasn't really him of course. But the crowd went crazy over his moonwalks and crotch-grabs.\n4) watch the \"sexiest DJ in Vegas\" spin? Can't say I agree with the sexiest part, but she's one of those platinum blonde barbie girls. I guess that's sexy.\n5) form a dance circle and do the running man in flipflops?\n6) have a full yard margarita strapped to your neck as you grind to Flo-rida?\n\nYes, there were spilled drinks on the ground. Big deal. Its the same with clubs that people pay 30 bucks to get in. It's not the place, but what you make of it. So if you know how to have fun, you can have fun anywhere! =)
