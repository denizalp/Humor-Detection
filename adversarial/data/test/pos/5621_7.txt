I chose Twist for my birthday dinner - having been to most of the other top restaurants in town, I was wanting to try something new and different for my birthday. It was a pleasant evening, but based on the prices and reputation of the chef I'm going to have to grade this place a little harshly. I'm going to draw several comparisons to Joel Robuchon because the price points are similar, although I realize Joel is meant to be more classic French and this food is meant to be more modern. \n\nAtmosphere: Beautiful! I do think Mix (which is quite similar from a design and view standpoint) is a bit prettier and has better views, but I do think this place was infinitely better than say Joel Robuchon from a design aesthetic. The music they played was very strange and space-age sounding, but I suppose that fits given the type of restaurant. \n\nFood: \n\n*Amuse Bouche - After being treated to a beautiful platter of canapes at Alex (so good my husband and I debated about asking for seconds!), and an amazing caviar & crab dish at Joel Robuchon, the amuse bouche here was pretty bad. It ranged from boring to interesting, but nothing tasted all that great. There were some boring bread sticks in olive oil (huh?). a mascarpone cheese ice cream with wasabi and sake (not good), a whiskey and guiness jello shot (huh??). and some boring cheese sandwich thing. Nothing I wanted seconds of!!\n\n*Bread - ok Joel Robuchon spoils you on bread for life I tell you. After being treated to a wheeled cart with 25+ choices there, the sad little plate of 3 breads (french, multigrain, and molasses with raisins) just wasn't cutting it. I can say the bread was served VERY hot and tasted pretty good. \n\n*Fig\/Foie Gras - They unfortunately didn't have any seared or warm foie gras available whatsoever (odd to me in winter! and in a FRENCH RESTAURANT), but whatever. Sadly they have removed the \"foie gras 4 ways\" and replaced it with this. This was just basic cold foie gras terrine. Not all that tasty or special or interesting. I've had many better foie gras terrines in my life. \n\n*\"Las Vegas\" - This to me showcases how weird and random his cuisine truly is! It had 4 components -\n* tuna over pears -just creative enough to be special, impeccable tuna\n*lamb shoulder - braised and DELISH. One of the more special items we ate last night. Sad it was a tiny portion. \n*guacamole with cactus - yup as boring and weird as it sounds\n*Martini glass with sorbet and popcorn - I'm all for fun food, but this was just SILLY. I'm sorry you can't just throw popcorn in a martini glass with boring sorbet and call it gourmet. Nope. \n\n*Nebraska ribeye 2 ways - this was a pleasant surprise! It was HUGE (there was 12 ounces or so of center cut meat) and the meat was incredible. It was served with cut up burnt gross meat swimming in oil with green beans (HUH? so this is your \"2 ways\"??) and some pumpkin thing if memory serves. The sides didn't matter as the main ribeye was very large and very tasty. They could skip the nasty oily grizzle meat on the side if they are trying to seem gourmet. \n\n*\"DEER\" - a little odd to call it deer (it's always been venison in TX!), but mb they call it that because it's unlike venison in any way. It wasn't gamey and it was VERY tender. It was like a \"deer\" filet mignon. It was served with some terrible brussel sprouts and chewy gnocchi. Again, stop serving crappy sides already! At least the meat was really good, so I could look past it. Best \"deer\" I've ever had (and growing up in TX we ate deer quite a bit!!). \n\n*Dessert - Pierre Gagnier 5 ways (or something like that!) - I'll skip the boring details but this was actually fun, and enjoyable. There were playful desserts and to me dessert is a time to be silly. chocolate, caramel, apple, pistachio, etc, etc lots of flavors and all delicious! \n\nWine: Pleasantly surprised with their domestic offerings. Some of my favorite Napa estate cabs were available and pricing wasn't really that bad. The wine service was very good as well. \n\nService: The waiters were French and in my opinion could have been a tad friendlier. Because this place is expensive I'm disappointed that the service wasn't better. We spent a LOT on food and wine and I don't feel like we were treated as such. I asked for another multigrain roll and was promised another one... it NEVER CAME. I specifically ordered the \"pre-theater menu\" ($10 less than the regular menu), but I was charged full price. My husband went without water for 30 minutes. Nit picky stuff, but service should have been flawless! \n\nOverall impressions: I'm glad to have dined here, but I can't say we will likely come back. The food ranged from boring to weird to delicious, but never had that \"this is the best bite of my life\" quality to it. The meats were impeccable and the desserts were fun -those were the highlights for me. Service could be better, but the restaurant is beautiful. I would recommend trying Joel Robuchon first if you're looking for a fancy French dinner.
