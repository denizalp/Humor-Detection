I was visiting home last week from New Orleans. Rhapsodielle as always been a place I've enjoyed shopping because as we all know the prices are reasonable and the selection of merchandise is so vast, it's hard to not walk out of there with something. I purchased five pieces from one of the newer locations on Warm Springs. \nThe next day I wore one of the pieces, which was a maxi dress by the end of the day the dress had ripped at the bottom of the dress. I'm 5'1..my stride is small. I don't walk crazily.  There is no reason this should have happen. I went into the store and they brought out the store manager and he would not allow me to exchange the dress. I didn't  want money back. I would have accepted the same dress and reinforced the bottom seams myself. The man was rude and did not tell me his name. I asked for a corporate number and he gave me a card. The card was actually the business card for the Warm Springs location. \n\nI managed a boutique in Las Vegas for many years and currently do so in New Orleans. I know that fighting someone over a $21.00 is not good for business. \n\nRhapsodielle is running a cruddy operation and I will not be shopping there in the future.
