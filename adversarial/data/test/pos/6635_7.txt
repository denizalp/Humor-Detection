Recently stayed here with the BF for three nights.  How did we end up here?  All thanks to travelocity.com and its priceline-like deals.  I like doing hotel reviews in a list style, so here it goes..\n\nPlus:\n-Super cheap!  I think we paid $20\/night.  \n- Just clean enough for you to feel comfortable enough to rest your head on the bed.  \n-Vegas monorail stop at the hotel.  Super convenient.  Also, it's the last stop, so there's really no way you can mess  up and end up going in the wrong direction (I can't tell you how many other passengers we'd end up riding with who all realized after the first stop that they were going the wrong way).  \n-Super cheap gambling.  $0.25 roulette machines.  $1 blackjack.  \n-daily slot machine tournament.  hilariously fun.  free to enter if you join their players' club (which is also free to enter) \n-daily $1 specials:  $1 shots, $1 hot dogs, and $1 beer\n\nMinuses:\n-Definitely more run down than the other casinos.  You notice it the moment you step inside--the air in the Sahara isn't as circulated as well, so you are instantly VERY AWARE that smoking is allowed indoors.  Versus, say, only moderately aware. \n-The crowd isn't great eye-candy.  When you're at, say, the MGM or what have you, you can take a look around and see how glammed up people are.  Here, at the Sahara, they're more low-key.  It's not unusual to see people walking around in unflattering sweatsuits. \n-The food.  Not fantastic at all. \n-The last stop on the monorail.  One of the farthest from the strip, yet somehow still considered to be on The Strip casinos.  \n\nAnyways, would I stay here again?  Probably not.  I'd definitely want to stay someplace a little closer to the other casinos.  Would I come back here to gamble?  Heck yes.  Despite all its flaws, the Sahara is still a fun little casino to spend time at.  \n\nIt's like going to an awkward work-related party--you want to go because you know it'll be good food, strong drinks, and maybe you win something..but you don't want to stay too long because hey, it's a work party.
