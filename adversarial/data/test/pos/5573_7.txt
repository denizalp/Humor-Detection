Very tasteful, well \"laid\" out museum.  \n\nOk, all kidding aside my husband and I really enjoyed this place.  Went here with another couple, all of us being open minded to sex and porn and I have to say I felt more like I was in a fine art museum.  I found everything interesting and I said, \"oh wow I had no idea\" and \"oh wow that's so cool\" a lot.  I had never really thought about the history of sex and porn and all the taboo associated with it, but I was impressed with all the very old artifacts and photos and movies.  Some of those early filmmakers were so brave - I applaud them for what they were doing in the times they were doing it.\n\nThe folks out front were so nice and informative and there was even a BDSM group doing very \"hands-on\" demonstrations while we were there.  Nothing about the whole experience felt weird or uncomfortable at all.  I would probably go again if we had guests with the same mindset we do.\n\nOh, and the penny penis - very cool!
