This place is amazing! I cannot resist good Hawaiian food, it's the perfect comfort cuisine. This is one of the best Hawaiian food joints I have ever eaten at.\n\n-Awesomely friendly service\n-Big portions\n-Big menu with many options\n-Everything is delicious\n-CHEAP! It's hard to find good cheap Hawaiian food these days\n\nI tried my personal favorite Loco Moco and was impressed. It was simply delightful. \n\nDo yourself a favor, drive 15 minutes to Henderson from the strip and try them out.
