Man; I am usually with the current flow of reviews so this is tough to go against! In fact, I almost cancelled my grandmothers birthday reservation here BECAUSE of said reviewers. Alas...I am here with my honest...expensive ass money paid out..by moi, review. \n\nWe are here tonight and the service...effing 5 stars...the food...I want to give 4.5 stars if I could; a full 5 for me personally is a \"holy shit, knock my socks off, can't get enough, home run; bullet proof thing.\" That DOES NOT MEAN THIS PLACE WASN'T AMAZING!\n\nWe ordered the filet and the flat iron chimichurri steaks and sides were wild mushrooms and also truffle risotto. All was cooked really, really well to our liking and personal asking. My grandmother was given the full treatment for her birthday as well....no extra charges...but that's not why I'm kissing a*hole. Not sure what the complaints were and what's crazy is...I was about to switch my reservation based on the reviews as of late. I am so grateful I stuck with my reservation here. In my personal experience, give it a shot ladies and gents. This place was knocking us out of the park with flavor, service and originality. \n\nWill be returning for sure. Maybe others went on an off night, and not sure how they easily spend $500 and were sooo not happy on two peeps; my Gma and I splurged on fancy steaks and two sides and a bottle of wine and with tip for an amazing experience restaurant and we were at $240. Give it a shot for a splurge event. I'm gnawing on my leftovers over my sink as I write this....sauce dripping down my elbow like the fancy lady I am!
