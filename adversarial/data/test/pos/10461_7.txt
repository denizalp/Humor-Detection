Let me ask you, Would you be a lil' confused if you went to a German Restaurant & the whole staff just about (or at least the front house; hostess, waitress, bartender) was all Black or Asian?\n\nOK, So while visiting AZ, I wanted to try some \"Soul Food\" (as advertised) and Stacy's was the only one open at this time that was somewhat close by.. so I decided to drive out to try it. \n\nWhen I walked in, it was almost like a culture shock! (No Lie) From me & the front house apparently because they just LITERALLY stood there looking (3 white women)!! I felt like I was at a Rodeo show & happen to land at this rodeo house type restaurant.\n\nBecause the bar is directly the first thing you come in contact with when walking in, I walked directly to it since the staff probably didn't even have a clue where they was at,. They all looked spaced out & confused. I won't come back maybe just based on the staff they hired to represent this soul food restaurant really.  \n\nThey seem reluctant to want to say anything. I asked was it there first day opening, explaining why they were acting so ignorant but she said that they had been open since July. \n\nThe ribs were OK, the sauce was good I guess but the corn bread could of used some more time getting cooked & the corn bread also tasted FISHY!\n\nThe Mac & Cheese was mediocre & could of been cooked longer too & my side order of beans were HARD. \n\nGood Riddance.
