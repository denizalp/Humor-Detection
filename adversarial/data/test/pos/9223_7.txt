The buffet here is absolutely disgusting. I came here with my girlfriend because we had a $10 off coupon. Big mistake. As soon as I started eating I wanted to puke and felt like I had diarrhea. In addition to making me feel sick, the food made me want to cry - this is the closest you can come to eating shattered dreams. The interior decor is a throwback to an era that would have been better off without furniture. I wouldn't recommend it to Tiger Woods if they had a mistresses station.
