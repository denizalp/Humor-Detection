Im still in love with this hike!! \n\nDefinitely went back thinking I was a beast but it didn't take long for the trail to tell me otherwise. It was more like a stair master on crack than a paved out trail.. Went alone this time. I would say it's a safe hike for a solo trecker. Saw a lot of families, solo-ers, duos, etc. Everyone is super friendly and encouraging. Once you make it past all the steep inclines, the view will be nothing short of amazing. Warning: there did seem to be a lot of flies around so maybe bug spray could be recommended..but..could've just been me, who knows.
