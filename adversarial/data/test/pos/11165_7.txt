Hmmm....don't even know where to start from...Me and my husband decided to stay in this hotel for our 2 year wedding anniversary. Huge mistake.\nAs soon as we entered our room, the strong smell ( like cat's urine...no joke) hit us. I turned on the AC and we left our room, 7 hours later we came back. Same strong smell.\nI could figure out what  was it, because the room was pretty clean. \nLater I was preparing to go to bed to sleep. I pulled out the duvet and stepped behind the bed next to the wall, and the carpet was all wet. Wow. That's why there was that smell. I don't even know what it was. Probably a sink water leakage behind the wall.\nNasty. \nI made a reservation 3 month prior for a standard room with a king size bed and we got a room with 2 queens. Seriously?  The beds were awful. Mattresses and pillows were extra firm. \nYou don't deserve to be called \"Paris\"
