Stopped by for quick breakfast as this was only place open outside of security...service was excellent!! The spicy chipotle egg sandwich was ok...not too spicy and croissant was soft. The breakfast with scrambled egg and ham and potato was ok as well. Egg wasn't very good as it was really clumpy but the ham was pretty good. Potatoes were so so, soft and not crispy at all...overall nothing too exciting but nothing else was open. Really 2.5 stars...only saving grace was the service...
