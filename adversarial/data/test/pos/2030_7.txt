A great local burger joint that opened a few months ago where Lenny's Deli used to be! The same owners still run it and the food is just as tasty as it was then!  I do miss their amazing corned beef sammiches though! \n\nBCB has a nice selection of 10 different burgers on their regular menu named after different cities around the country, hence the name. (see pic) They also have the Big City Burger, which is just a plain burger with lettuce, onion, and tomato that you can customize with your choice of cheese and assorted toppings. The 12th burger is the Memphis, which has been on the specials board since they opened. Haha (see pic too) So far, I've had the St. Louis, the Clevelander, and the Chicago and I've honestly loved them all! Each is burger is cooked fresh to order on the flat top with a full 1\/2 pound of juicy beef, melted cheese, fresh veggie toppings, and other assorted toppings and condiments piled high on a toasted brioche bun. Sofaking good!  Any burger patty can be substituted for a grilled chicken breast or organic black bean burger for no extra charge!  \n\nBurgers come with fries and you can substitute sweet potato fries or onion rings for a small additional charge.  The fries are good, but don't appear to be fresh cut. The onion rings seemed to be homemade though. They were nice and crispy.  They also have three kinds of salad: House, Wedge, and Caesar.  It's a fairly simple menu and it works.\n\nThe dining room is clean and cozy with maybe 5 booths, a high top, and a few tables.  There's a small TV mounted on the wall for entertainment.\n\nThe workers at BCB are great! They've always been very friendly and they seem to genuinely enjoy working there.  The owner (I think his name is Joey) is really cool and laid back.  He does the majority of the cooking and he does a damn good job of it!\n\nIf you're in the mood for a big, hot, juicy burger, stop in and give Big City Burgers a try! You won't leave hungry!\n\nThis place is just around the corner from my house...that's dangerous! O_0!
