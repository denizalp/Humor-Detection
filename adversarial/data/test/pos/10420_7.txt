*3.8*\n\nI was craving a hot dog today and was near Ted's but remember I had bookmarked Lobby's and decided to try it. New, nice and simple interior. Not busy even though it was lunch time, I guess because it's a new place. Service was very good. I ordered a hot dog, fries and soda. I got my soda and my food was brought to me. The fries were very good, I would have liked them to be hotter though. My first impression when I saw my hot dog was what the..?!!! The relish was radioactive green! It looked fake. I am not familiar with Chicago style hot dogs, so I wonder if the relish is supposed to look that way? In any case, the relish was a tad too sweet for my taste. The hot dog was tasty and the bun was delicious!! Fluffy and fresh, could have eaten it even without the hot dog.\n\nBeing a new local place I wish them luck and will continue to visit to try other items. The burgers and beef sandwiches looked great.
