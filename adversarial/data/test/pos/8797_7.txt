This place is legit! I'm a serious burger girl and I try to find the best everywhere I go. I'll admit that I've only gotten to try a couple here in Vegas so far, but this place blew most others I've ever been to out of the water!\n\nI was so absorbed in all of the burger options that I almost missed their small list of burger specials on the front of the menu. Thank goodness Ms. G said something about a lamb burger and I had to know more. It's one of their current specials, so who knows how long it'll be around. However, it's apparently won some awards. So if it sells well, they could make it a permanent choice. \n\nThis burger was loaded with tikka masala mushrooms, a dill daal sauce and red onion. I also opted to add bacon because I insist on having bacon on just about every burger I eat. Bacon tastes totally awesome with an Indian burger, right? RIGHT! \n\nThe patty itself was magnificent! It had the perfect char, which added great flavor and texture. And the toppings were crazy flavorful with just the tiniest bit of heat in the background. \n\nMy friends and I also shared Fries - the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and the Sweet Potato Fries. Personally, the simple sweet potato fries were the bigger winner for me. So many places suck at sweet potato fries, but this place actually does them right. Soft in the center, a little crunch on the the outside and actually seasoned with salt (why do so many places leave them unseasoned\/under-seasoned??). I'm sure most people might prefer the chili fries because it is a pretty impressive dish because of how it's absolutely loaded. But it was a little too spicy for my tastes and I do prefer my chili without beans. \n\nI absolutely cannot wait to bring my husband here, not to mention anyone who comes to visit us. So I will absolutely return soon!
