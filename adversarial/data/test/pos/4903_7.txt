This is a very small casual sleek MODERN gourmet burger joint that also offers cocktails and beers. You're most likely coming here for the insanely great grass fed beef burgers. I had a really terrific beef burger from here before so this time I tried the sushi grade ahi tuna burger. The chopped up tuna patty was held together with whole grain and seemed light as air. The patty was topped with buttery avocado for richness and that spicy sauce made the burger really delicious. I also liked that the bun didn't seem too big and was sturdy but also seemed light at the same time. We shared the non-traditional deviled eggs. They were really large and tasty with a little fresh dill and pretty pieces of beetroot. We also shared the shattered potato chips. They were crisp and some had soft centers. The chips came with jalapeño sauce and labne. The jalapeño sauce that came with the chips was very tasty and the Lebanese style yogurt cooled you down so things don't get too spicy. When you're done they offer you complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies. \n\nThe help were extremely helpful and friendly.\n\nThe restaurant is hospital-like sparkling clean. \n\nThey offer a small dog friendly patio.\n\nParking lot is small.\n\nA complimentary valet is located across the street.\n\nHigh quality ingredients prepared to perfection with Great Service in a pristine clean environment deserves 5 Stars.
