Do not let the PF Chang's ownership fool you into believing their cuisine is any better than Panda Express. Essentially it's the same thing but at a higher price and slower service. And with Panda setting the bar very low for Chinese food,  Pei Wei is subterranean on the quality scale. \n\nSpecifically, the dishes are extremely salty, way too sweet and greasy. Yes, that's the definition of American cooking. But it still sucks. And rounding out their Americana - they deep fry the Kung Pow'ed chicken. I guess with a few token snow peas mixed with the fried rice, this fast food appears more Hoity-Toity than a Swanson Oriental TV Dinner from Walmart, but don't be fooled by marketing and mid-range pricing.
