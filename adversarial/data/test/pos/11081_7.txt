Garlic knots are delicious. However, the pizza isn't the best. It was food court quality and I wouldn't have it again. $5 for a slice a pizza...not worth it!\n\nMy sister-in-law ordered a salad...there were two salads on the menu; Caesar salad and a side salad. Since she doesn't like Caesar dressing, she ordered the side salad...then asked what kind of dressing they have...they only have Caesar lol. So basically, they have two sizes...not two different salads.
