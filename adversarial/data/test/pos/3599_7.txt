The only reason I give this lounge\/club 5 stars is because if you have the coin, it is worth the stop. No one would expect Mirage to have.one of the best lounge\/club areas next to newer casinos but it does. Even with hour waits, the lines are filled up with women dressed to the nine. The dj's mix hours of spinning different genres with  confedi drops on the hour past midnight. I mean mother funk'n confedi! Who not love that stuff. Drinks are pricey which is expect from a Vegas establishment but with separate rooms of choice from house to hip-hop, you can't  possibly go wrong.\n\ndp
