0.5 actually. They earn .5 merely for being an option in the stress-inducing travel industry.\n\nMy issue is with GREYHOUND, and not the Bay Station. \n\nGreyhound Canada aka Greyhound USA offers terrible customer service in the back end. Refunds are a logistical nightmare, their American offices don't care about service and quality control at all, and one call resolution is fairytale pixie dust (in fact, expect to be hung up on repeatedly even if you keep your politest tone on).\n\nTHE STORY: I bought a Refundable fare on Feb 16, cancelled the trip March 18 (long before the planned April trip) and was told a refund would take place within 14 business days. \nWe are May 2nd and I have yet to get answers on the processing of my refund. I've been hung up on, I've been muted (you know the deal... That CSR agent who presses mute as you talk on so they can go about their business) and have even (reluctantly) escalated to a manager to no avail. \n\nGreyhound will never get my business again. \n\nI RECOMMEND: the train\n\nEXTRA TIP: If you have to travel by bus- get the lowest fare, don't count on a refund, and have a contingency plan in case of itinerary changes (another true story).
