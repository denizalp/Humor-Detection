This place is as undesirable as living on the street and I have done that. The carpet has the odor and stains of a cheap motel while the furniture bare similar resemblance to something I left in front of my yard for donation. \n\nAs with anything in Las Vegas, you pay for what you get. \n\nNext time my buddies want to go to Las Vegas and book the Rio, I will turn them down.
