Picked up some delicious poke in-between games during the last LVI tournament in LV.  Our daughter was playing and we told her to take it easy, but that didn't stop us (lol!)...\n\nActually, I had heard that there was a Yelp UYE event that morning but by the time we had gotten there they must have dined and dashed.  Much of the ahi under the counter was gone, but the owner said \"no worries\" and offered to make us some fresh from the back http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/poke-express-north-las-vegas?select=9Mto2GARkgh9NYhFUHphzw#vZUp_KgAKw2h-ar4vAp30g;  SUPER COOL!  They don't have any tables within PE, so he also volunteered that we might go a couple of door's down to 808 Mixed Plate;  so friendly...\n\nThis is why I will be coming back whenever I'm in town...
