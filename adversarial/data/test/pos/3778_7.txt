In a hurry? This place is perfect for getting pizza to-go! I had the spinach chicken pizza ($6.50) and garlic knot ($1). My favorite part was the garlic knot!! So soft and fluffy. The pizza is HUGE! I couldn't finish it though; it was good but a little too oily and salty for my taste. I will definitely be back for the garlic knots though, they also sell them 4 for $3!
