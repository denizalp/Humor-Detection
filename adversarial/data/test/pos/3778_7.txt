During our 8-day visit, we came to Moose Bawr seven times. \n\nSEVEN. FREAKING. TIMES. \n\nWe didn't have the food, because we didn't come here to eat. We came here to drink, baby, drink. \n\nAnd drink we did. \n\nFeeling adventurous? Try playing their coin flipping game and prepare to make the list on the wall. Also prepare to get really, really inebriated. \n\nThe crowd is young, the drinks are strong and the music is loud. \n\nAlso, the bartenders rock, especially Charles, Justin and Oscar. Or as I like to call them, the Sobriety Annihilators.
