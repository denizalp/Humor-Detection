The waiter recommended the lettuce wraps (lettuce leaves with minced chicken breast, water chestnuts, mushrooms, celery, carrots and bean sprouts served with hoisin and Chinese mustard), so I tried it. These lettuce wraps were pretty good, especially with the hoisin sauce, but don't go overboard on the spicy Chinese mustard or you'll get all choked up. Yeah, it's pretty potent...\n\nThe rest of my party wasn't so lucky. They had gripes about their dishes being too salty, or too bland. On top of that, service was below average. Maybe next time (if there is a next time) our waiter will be more attentive to us!  He disappeared after he served our food and I was dying of thirst waiting for a fricken refill on my drink!
