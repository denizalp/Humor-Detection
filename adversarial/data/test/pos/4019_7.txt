OMG WHY?! They really need to remove this show from the Luxor. I would give Criss' fine ass assistant the full 5 stars, but had to deduct 3 for Mr. Angel's performance.\n\nThe magic tricks he performed I've seen so many times from other magicians (doves coming out of his cape, cutting a girl in half, etc. etc). He should just stick with his television show so that they can make his tricks \"look\" more like, WHOOOOAAA!!!! HOW'D HE DO THAT? And please do not advertise a huge poster of yourself levitating, if your not even gonna do it!!\n\nIt's so funny that he says, \"Is this fair?\" or \"What you see is what you get!\" or his most famous quote, \"ARE YOU REAAAADDDYYYY?!?!?!?!?!\n\nThe side show performance was so lame with their sexual innuendos which was not proper since there were some children in the audience.\n\nDon't waste your money on this...just watch the other Cirque du Soleil shows that deserve your hard earned money! O, Ka or Michael Jackson's One! \n\nI really should've just gone to REAL magicians like David Copperfield and Lance Burton.
