There seem to be mixed reviews for this place and maybe it depends on the time of the year. But for my next stay in Scottsdale I won't be giving Hotel Indigo another shot. \n\nWe had a few problems like....\n\nOur reservation: Our reservation was mixed up and my dad and I were given one bed. (Yikes) The person at the front desk explained that there must have been confusion with Expedia and that unfortunately because it was a busy weekend due to spring training the hotel was all booked and he had no rooms available with two beds. OK fine, I can understand that. Sometimes shit just happens and its out of your control. But what really got me was that he quickly added that they didn't have any cots or extra bedding available. So basically we paid a double room rate for one of us to sleep on the couch with a couch pillow and a bed runner as a blanket. Great...\n\nThe shower: It was broken. Plain and simple. The shower head didn't work at all so we had to use the hand held extension which had little to no water pressure and because there were no extra rooms available we were SOL. The pipes also sounded like they were going to bust at any second. The noise was so loud through the wall that you couldn't even hear the TV if someone was showering. Which leads me to....\n\nThe noise: People seemed to be running (literally) around at all hours and who knows what the people above us were doing but it sounded like they were teaching tap dance lessons. The walls are so thin that you can hear everything everywhere. I mean I could literally hear the guy in the room next to us word for word explaining on the phone to his wife all the charges made to their joint expense account including a rather large bar tab at the Rusty Spur. Dude was in the dog house for sure. We also happened to be on the pool side of the hotel as well so I woke up every morning to Sheryl Crow \"Soak Up The Sun \"blasting from the pool speakers which isn't exactly what I'd like to wake up to every morning (especially after sleeping on the couch)\n\nIt is a super cute hotel with a posh little interior but for what it is, definitely not worth the weekend rates. Why pay boutique hotel rates for what essentially is a college dorm disguised by modern decor and ikea furniture.
