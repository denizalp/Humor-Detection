Pretty solid food, decent prices, and this place ain't on Spring Mountain Road....\n\nWe got the Crispy Noodles with Mixed Seafood, Kung Pao Chicken\n\n and the Honey Walnut Shrimp\n\nwhich were pretty tasty. Service was also great and friendly, Definitely worth \n\nchecking out if you're in the area....ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(95\/365) \" The OTHER Express\"
