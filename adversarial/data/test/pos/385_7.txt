Probably one of the longest wait I've every had to experience just for a subway sandwich. Subway did launch an app to order in advance then come pick up when things are ready. I don't frequent to subway when I'm in the city. But since I'm out I Vegas for work, you'd think the quickest place to get food with a sandwich spot. WRONG.\n\nAt the Mandalay Bay, there's only this one food court with 4 businesses; Johnny Rockets, Nathan, Pan Asian Express and Subway. There needs to be another food court! It was an hour of a wait for subway and all stalls had long lines. Service was alright, it's a food court. They fulfilled all requests that were asked. Just the wait if ridiculous. Maybe next time I'll try their app and see if it's any better than physically waiting on line\n\n\nAVOID THE FOOD COURT IF YOU CAN DURING PEAK LUNCH HOURS!
