Wow! My first omakase style meal in Las Vegas and I absolutely loved it! My Japanese mom enjoyed it too. The service here was simply fantastic and the food was melt in your mouth delicious. \n\nAs long as you're not a picky eater and are willing to try something new, then Omakase is the way to go. The chef selects your entire meal selection which is so much fun. You never know what you're going to get and everything compliments each other to perfection. Plus it takes away the stress of having to choose what to eat. You just get to sit back and enjoy the amazing food.\n\nThe sashimi was super fresh and reminded me of eating in Japan. This place has the flavor I've been looking for in Vegas. I'm so happy and excited that I found this place (thanks to my Yelp friends and their reviews). I honestly can't wait to go back and try some more.
