After a night clubbing in Vegas, we needed a taco NOW!!  So after searching Yelp we decided on this place after reading some of the reviews. At least what I could comprehend after a night of drinking.  We got a Lyft over from our club or somewhere and there was a huge line and I thought my taco craving was about to be handled.  Man was I wrong. We ordered pretty much one of every taco except adobada which I really wanted and they were out of.  The meat was crunchy and over cooked. Plus no salsa!!!!  Let me say it again, no salsa!!!  WHat The Freak!!!  My wife and I are thoroughly disappointed.  Well, we are in Vegas for a few more days so our search will continue. Stay tuned yelpers!!
