Dishonest service! \n\nI called them to ask about a humidor as a present for my father. I was told that they start at $50 and those would include everything he needs for 10-15 cigars. My brother went later that day to buy it. He was told the cheapest humidor they sell is $100 and even those are too lousy to be worth buying. So now we have no present for my dad's birthday.
