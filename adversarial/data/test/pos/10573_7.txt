I found Quaker Steak & Lube as a nice place to sit down and relax while waiting for my flight home.  The restaurant's name is a play off of the Commonwealth's motor oil company, Quaker State.  This explains the restaurant design having an auto theme, filled with street style signage, license plates, auto parts, gas stations, etc...  Don't let the \"Steak\" in their name fool you, wings are the feature item here.  QS&L is a franchise and currently has over 65 locations spreading throughout 18 states.\n\nI would be lying if I said the wings were the best I ever had, heck not even in my Top 10.  But as a wing aficionado, that is a very hard list to crack.  The wings were fair and the sauce (went w \"hot\") was tasty.  I found the wings very similar to competitor Buffalo Wild Wings.  Also similar, QS&L has over 20 sauce options, from standard offerings such as medium and hot to more unique such as siracha and haute parm.  Many of the sauces are available for purchase by the bottle.\n\nPros:\n\nService - I found the service to be very good here.  There were two staffers tag teaming the restaurant (including the bar) and they did a solid job with refills and making sure that I had everything I needed.\n\nAtmosphere - You get to take advantage of PGH International Airport free wifi while being able to take your pick between four nice sized HD televisions.  \n\nPost Meal - I was presented with a Twizzler and a nice sized wet wipe in QS&L branded packaging.\n\nCons:\n\nBlue Cheese - they tried to get away with providing one teeny-tiny pre-packaged container.  Fortunately the staff was very accommodating and delivered on providing an additional.  \n\nOutlets - Airport restaurants need to get on the ball and provide more power outlets for their customers.  Who doesn't want to power up before catching a plane?  \n\nBeer glass sizes - Only one size option 16 oz (nothing smaller or bigger) available.  \n\nAll things said, a fine place to spend your time pre-flight.  I Can certainly see myself returning to QS&L in the future.
