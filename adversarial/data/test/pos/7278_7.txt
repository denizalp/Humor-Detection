First time here I saw comedian Stephen Wright. Have always seen him on numerous HBO comedy specials over the years so seeing him live should be a treat.\n\nThe theater itself has a nice cozy setting about it. I would say you can probably fit at least 500 attendees. The seats are comfortable and you have access to cup holders that's located on the back of the seats in front of you. The lighting and sound was pretty good but then again it was just for a standup comedy show. I have heard of numerous bands playing here like Air Supply and the The Temptations so I cannot comment on how the sound truly is until I see a band here.\n\nSome useful info. If you have your ticket already and stand in front of the showroom entrance long enough you just might have a promoter or two upgrade your tix for better ones since they usually hold some of the better tix for the high rollers which dont always show up. On this night, we got lucky for we were still waiting for two more people before going in to the showroom. One of the promoters noticed us just standing there so she offered us better tix since we had ours in hand already. The bathroom is to the right of the theater. You cant bring anything that's glass so they have plastic cups conveniently located on tables as you make your entrance. The box office is conveniently located to the left of the entrance. Also make sure this is where your show is supposed to be and not at the Orleans Arena. I made the mistake of making my way to the arena assuming that the show was there.\n\nOverall I had a great time. I just gotta remember where this is located. I think any show would be nice to watch here.\n\nYelp 2015 Review #37\n536 overall
