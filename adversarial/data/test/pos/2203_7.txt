The Forum Shops are glitzy and flashy and all things Vegas trying to feel like Europe. But not.\n\nThere's a large assortment of shopping you can do after you've had a few cocktails or one of those extra large neon colored cocktails in a long bottle thing attached to a lanyard around your neck. Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Victoria's Secret, Lush, Ted Baker, etc.  There's also a lot of restaurants, Joe's Crab Shack, Border Grill, Carmine's, Sushi Roku and others. \n\nThere's great people watching and the fountains are nice for taking pictures, a good place to go when you want to blow that money you just won.
