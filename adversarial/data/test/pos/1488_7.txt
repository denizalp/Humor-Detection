Had a few glasses of Wine with The Better Half and some friends the other night.  We enjoyed the atmosphere of the lounge.....comfortable sofas & chairs....fun to people watch.  Hung out for a couple of hours and our glasses were never empty.....as it should be.  Prices weren't too bad....we paid $13 for a glass of Malbec.\n\nReturn Factor - 89.7%
