BOO!!!! If i had the opportunity to give this place a HUGE ZERO I would.  This place is not only disgusting it hires the stupidest people to work their front register. I figured 4 stars from Yelp this place cant be bad.  As Shane does not eat beans he simply ordered a steak burrito with NO beans, he even asked the chick at the front counter if it had beans inside and she said no.  Why did we end up with a soggy chimichanga and a bean burrito when we got all the way home?  Their salsa taste processed like pace or cheap. The soggy chimichanga was wet and not flavor full.  The man was not able to eat anything as his whole order was messed up resulting in all beans.  I was able to salvage the chicken from the soggy chimichanga and fed it too the dogs.  At least they did not go hungry.
