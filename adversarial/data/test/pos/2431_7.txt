A year late, but I really enjoyed my experience flying with Porter so much from Chicago to Montreal. Best airline I ever rode by far, other than Southwest Airlines(hard to say which of the 2 I prefer more, since it'd be a coin flip). I did really appreciate the free beer.\n\nAnd they even saved my arse too, when I told one of the staff at Billy Bishop Airport that I'd stupidly had left my passport on the plane, which coincidentally was flying to Ottawa after doing the Montreal to Toronto run, and rescheduled our flight for the one after. They called the Porter staff at Ottawa, to find my passport and hold it, then fly the passport back to Toronto. 5 star customer service for saving my butt like that, easily!
