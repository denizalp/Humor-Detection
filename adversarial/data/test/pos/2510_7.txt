Tokyo Cafe is the most recent business to give it a try in this tenant space.  I remember this address being a Guamanian restaurant, an Italian\/Chinese restaurant, a wannabe Panda Express restaurant, and now it's a Japanese restaurant.  This is potentially the best one of the bunch.\n\nFor those of you living in North Las Vegas, the most significant thing about Tokyo Cafe is that (to my knowledge) they are the only ones serving a \"real\" bowl of ramen in this part of town.  Choice of tonkotsu, shoyu, or miso broths, chashu pork, soft boild eggs, seaweed, bamboo shoots; it's mostly all there.  I've had the miso ramen, which actually looked and tasted like a shoyu ramen.  The broth had decent but light flavor, which had me adding plenty of garlic and togarashi.  The chashu was tender, small in portion, and light on flavor.  Noodles were overcooked and past al dente.\n\nThe menu also offers some other noodle dishes, and some curry dishes, along with a few appetizers.  Based on the one dish I've had, I can at least take it for what it is, and acknowledge that this is probably the best\/only choice for ramen in North Las Vegas.  It was decent enough that I'll be sure to return and try their other offerings; otherwise, make the drive out to Chinatown for full satisfaction.
