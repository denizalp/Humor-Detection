Amazingly delicious! I stumbled across this place last week. I have been back a few times already. The carne asada tacos are pretty great, the chicken tacos are really tasty and the birria tacos are arguably the best tacos I have ever eaten. They taste so good to me that I started to fear that I had developed some kind of eating disorder. The kind where you love food more than yourself and keep eating way past the point of being full until you feel sick. The last time I was there I ate 7 tacos, a small refried beans, chips and salsa, plus pickled onions, radishes, and a plate full of cucumber slices. \n\nI do not recommend taking someone here on a first date. While you will definitely enjoy the food to the max, the depraved eating style you slip into my be a turnoff to the other person. Putting more taco in your mouth seems like a much better use of time than making idle small chat with someone you hardly know.\n\nThere is no doubt that you should eat here. Go as soon as possible. You will love it!\n\nEDIT : July 2015 : Update\n\nI eat here around once a week, but sometimes maybe three times in one week. I have a few tips to share with you. There are a couple of off menu items that you can order. My favorite is a burrito in a cup. I usually only order one when they have whole beans available. They have whole beans before they mash them into refried beans. It is great if I want to eat while driving or just to take home and eat it for dinner. When picking up your order you can ask them for grilled jalapenos and grilled onions. Be warned. I love hot food, but the jalapenos they serve are pretty freaking warm. My lower eyelids just started sweating just typing that. Man I love this place.\n\nOh man! Just updating this review made me crave Backyard Taco and I decided to run down there and grab a late lunch. I had 5 birria tacos and got a chicken burrito in a cup to go.
