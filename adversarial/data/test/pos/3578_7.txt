I'm not a health food nut by any means (I'm a Lays chip, \"can't have just one\", kind of girl). But recently, I've made more of an effort to look at healthier meal options, and, after noticing fellow Yelper check-ins here, I thought I'd give it a shot - verdict: we really liked it! Located in Etobicoke, just west of Lakeshore Road West and Kipling Ave, we had no idea this place existed, but it's certainly accessible and a great option for organic and\/or vegan meal options in the west end - good for your soul + body!\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu that offers brunch, lunch, and dinner options. We ordered the 'Soup of the Day' (on a Monday, it was a Cream of Ginger and Sweet Potato with Coconut) which came with sprouted grain bread, the 'Fresco' pizza which had a variety of vegetables as toppings, and a Mocha Latte (which was a little too bitter for me - I'd pass on this next time). \n\nThe food itself was delicious, the pizza had a great drizzle of sauce, and the soup had a number of flavours thrown in that worked really well together - I actually didn't miss my meat at all! Portion size was also more than I expected and quite generous - I was surprised at how uber gigantic the soup bowl was! Our meal worked out to be a good amount for two people. \n\nNote that its a bit pricier than your average casual diner (but for what it is, and what you're getting, I guess the price point seems fair). Ambiance is casual and easygoing but still with a modern feel. There's plenty of seating so it could definitely play host to a family dinner out or a dinner with a group of friends. \n\nFor our entire order, with tax, our total was around $29.00. I'll definitely be back for brunch and those quinoa pancakes!
