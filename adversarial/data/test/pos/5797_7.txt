I have been to CnC a couple of times, most recently for my son's birthday.\n\nLet me break this down.\n\nOverall, I was extremely pleased, they have cleaned it up in a major way. The bathrooms are nicely done, the employees are a lot nicer, and it seems much brighter and just in general cleaner. I don't feel like I have to shower in Clorox when I leave.\n\nNow sections:\n\nGolf - They have 4 mini golf courses and they are a lot of fun. They are taken care of as much as one really can, and my husband and I would still love to take a date night and go play a round of golf at CnC.\n\n\nRides\/Attractions - They have added a few more attractions and then of course they have old Faithful Desert Storm. It appears they have the rides in good working order, and keep the lines moving quickly for them (you wont find me on a roller coaster SORRY) but my sons absolutely loved going on the rides here.\n\n\nArcade - Much more up to date than last time I was here. Cleaner, games are a lot more fun, and they have a card redemption system which I am pleased with. It looses 1 major star for not being wheelchair accessible (or stroller accessible) you want to go upstairs? SORRY. No elevator.\n\n\nEmployees - Every employee I dealt with was knowledgeable and friendly I was pretty pleased.\n\n\nClientele - For the most part it is a bunch of families or kids having a good time. However there are a few people shaking down machines because they think its funny or they think they will win something....juvenile, if I could tell CnC something it would be keep a closer eye on the people you have running around as clients, it doesn't appear you are hurting for business, it wouldn't hurt to ban a couple of thugs now and again. (Keeps your bathrooms untagged too!)
