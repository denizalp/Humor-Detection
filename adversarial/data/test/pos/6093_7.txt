I needed some files to be restored. My sister borrowed my old laptop. My sister is a teenager, and we all know how considerate and thoughtful teenagers can be. Long story short, she deleted all my files without asking me. \n\nThis was closer to me than any other computer repair shops, so I gave them a try. \nI felt restricted by the real estate, and despite some of the products on sale here, they felt more like decorations. I don't know much about computer hard hardware components. It seems the merchandise on sale would suit most regular replacement needs. There are no big box brand retailers nearby, so it serves its purpose by offering convenience of location for such products. \n\nIt cost twenty dollars for the system analysis. It was a painstakingly tedious process that relied only on the software the computer was running. Five hours later, I felt the need to check up on the guy after receiving one call asking me questions about my laptop that he should have asked me in the beginning. When I showed up unannounced, I saw the guy connected to his Call of Duty account. I don't know if I recognize his user name, it seemed familiar. He might one of those campers who snipes brave internet soldiers like me, who prefer to engage the enemy. I cannot condone such behaviour. I wanted to challenge him to a squad match, but he'll probably kill me. I need to keep my Battlefield 4 points up. The guy works in a computer store, defeat is inevitable. \n\nI left my laptop overnight for the program to attempt to recover my files. All of the crucial documents were not retrieved. I got some files back, but not the ones I was dying to get back. Six years worth of scripts and material, conversations with friends. Gone. That was until I went to another computer repair shop, where half of the documents were recovered in under four hours for half the price. I should have been more observant. An electron has nothing to do with computing. To be fair, the other place I went to was very \"Asian.\" So I'm not sure whether what they did to recover my files was completely legal. Electron Computer INC is an international franchise, which comes with their restrictions as to what programs they use, and how they use it. It seems that this location deals mainly with hardware component issues, and I've brought them a complex software problem. It certainly appeared to be the case when compared to the other computer repair store. This was a lesson I'd rather not have learned the hard way, but at least it was only $20. I wasn't charged anymore than that.\n\n\nI was going to buy my sister a new laptop for Christmas, but now I think I'll just give her this one she wiped clean.
