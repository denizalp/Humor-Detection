I came here two nights in a row... in the same outfit.  I also saw a bunch of people on the second night that I saw the first night, further making my inability to get dressed that day unfortunate.  Oh well, it's just Pattie's and as my gusband (gay husband) pointed out, no straight man is going to notice that I wore the same outfit as yesterday.\n\nSome things to note:\n\nThere are all sorts of characters inside from frat boy types to old men with vertical eye scars like Mufasa's evil brother in the Lion King.  \n\nThe jello shots come in a shitty Dixie cup that gets mushy and shapeless making it impossible to get your vodka filled jello out without looking like a heathen. \n\nThere are a lot of regulars that seem to come every night. \n\nYou will run into someone you know.  So don't recycle last night's outfit out of laziness. \n\nThis will be the one bar in Scottsdale that will make you smell like smoke when you leave. \n\nI guess that's it.\n\nFor some reason I just don't get all excited over this place (I don't want to relive middle school) .  I'd rather go to Coach House if I'm in the mood for a bar like this, but fun can be had here nonetheless.
