Brought here by a family from O'ahu, it's a relatively simple menu highlighting one of Hawai'i's most quintessential meals called Plate Lunch or Mixed Plate (if the plate has more than one entrée). There's no shortage of choices with nine meats, five sides, three bases, and a myriad of sauces. \n\nMy brother and I visited in the middle of the afternoon last week and it was surprisingly busy for a random weekday. There weren't any tables available when we arrived, but that quickly changed by the time we had our food. It's a very familiar style of ordering - you wait in line on the left and order down the line at the counter until you reach the cashier.\n\nPricing:\nOno (Small): 1 meat, 1 side, 1 base | $4.99\nOno'er (Medium): 2 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $6.99\nOno'est (Large): 3 meats, 2 sides, 1 base | $8.49\nBowl: 2 meats, 1 base | $5.99\nSalad: 2 meats, dressing | $7.99 (or $5.99 without meat)\n*Steak is an extra $1 per serving\n*Poke is an extra $1.25 per serving\n*Brown Rice is an extra $0.50.\n\nWe opted for two \"Ono'est\" plates to try as many options as possible. The first plate: Pulehu Steak, Kalua Pig, Hawaiian Pokē, Tossed Salad with Creamy Sesame Dressing, Macaroni Salad, and Brown Rice ($11.24). The second plate: White Rice, Mochiko Wings, Chicken Katsu, Seared Spicy Ahi Pokē, Macaroni Salad, and Kimchi Slaw ($9.74). We really enjoyed all the items. Everything was flavorful and exactly what you want in Hawaiian eats. The tossed salad was fresh with a great dressing; the kimchi slaw was surprisingly delightful; and all of the OGs were done right (Kalua Pig, Poke). This is definitely the best plate lunch spot in Vegas!\n\nExtra details: There are two types of Ahi Poke, Hawaiian and Spicy; both can be seared per request. There are sauces available next to the soda fountain: Da Katsu Sauce, Da Spicy Sauce, Da Steak Sauce, and Da Yaki Sauce. (The names may have changed a little because I swear there was a Spicy Yaki?) I really liked the Spicy\/Spicy Yaki sauce; it went well with the Pulehu Steak and Katsu.
