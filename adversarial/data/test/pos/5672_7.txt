New Chinese spot- they specialize in lunch specials and takeout, but food quality is better than your average mom-and-pop Panda Express. Food is fresh and menu has more options than expected, including boba drinks and spam musubi, but dishes are of the more Americanized style that is all too easy to find elsewhere.\n\nLunch specials are around $7, dinner specials are $9, but I opted to try the lettuce wraps- available in chicken, shrimp, vegetable, or combination. I found it odd this dish was listed in the \"Chef Specialties\" section, but the $9 chicken portion I received was enough for two meals with several lettuce leaves, more than enough filling, and a giant heap of rice.\n\nNote that though they highlight their takeout and low prices, but food is cooked to order and it can take a bit longer than you might expect. Consider calling ahead if you're in a hurry.\n\nEDIT: This is now my go-to boba stop in Summerlin, because it's always perfectly cooked. The huge NY style eggrolls are awesome and packed with bbq pork and shrimp, two easily make a meal!
