A pleasant surprise. Continuing to reach out to restaurants relatively close to my new home, La Madonna is about 5 miles away. \n\nNice looking place. Kinda surprised at the location - it's basically a high-end mexican restaurant. To be honest, not sure if there are too many high end places in town. I question the location since it's on the outskirts of town. \n\nRoomie and i started with cocktails - i went with the tangerine mojito. she tried a virgin paloma (a grapefruity drink ) - the mojito was very refreshing ( $9 ) , the paloma ok but damn, $9 for a virgin drink - me no likey that ! server brought a nice warm basket of seasoned tortilla chips with 3 different salsas - they all tasted great ! \n\nStarted with the tuna appetizer ( $12) - basically a tostada with a crema base then sushi grade ahi tuna - very thin, then a light sauce w\/ lime - very good ! \n\nRoomie went with the fish tacos ( talapia - $16 ) i tried the chilean sea bass con cilantro ( $28 ) . Both were very good - the portion for the sea bass a little on the small side. I had a cadillac margarita with the sea bass - very good ! we also got a side of sweet corn tamale. the first few bites were excellent - moist, sweet, flavorful. the remaining tamale was a little on the dry side. \n\nI like this place. I'm not one to eat mexican food all that often but for sure, if i'm looking for a higher end mexican place, I'm here !
