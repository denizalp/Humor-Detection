I don't normally commemorate (or even so much as notice) review milestones, but with my 500th review coming up, I noticed that I still hadn't written a review of this fantastic fountain show. What better occasion for an ode to a place that never grows old?\n\nI'd been on vacation to Las Vegas several times during my childhood and early adulthood, but for some reason, I'd never seen the Fountains of Bellagio aside from the movie Ocean's Eleven. I've been doing my best to make up for that oversight starting from when I relocated here in 2011. Friends and family alike have found me leading them here when I can.\n\nThe officially scheduled public fountain shows are every half hour from 3-8pm (or from 12pm on the weekend and every 15 minutes from 8pm-midnight (and 11am-3pm for some sort of \"Fountains Brunch at Jasmine\"). I typically take advantage of the night-time frequency to catch 2-3 shows from 8pm onward.\n\nEverybody enjoys the giant bursts of water that often punctuate climactic moments in songs. They are awesome, no doubt. However, I find that the patterns formed by adjusting the smaller streams require more creativity and finesse, and I've grown to appreciate these moments more and more. Some shows will seem to have explosive eruptions every few seconds, and that takes some of the magic away. I do remember one or two shows without any bursts at all, however, and those are also a little bit of a letdown.\n\nI've heard lots of repeat songs by now. Some of the ones that come to mind are that Celine Dion song from Titanic, Luck Be A Lady by Sinatra, and Billie Jean by Michael Jackson. It's most exciting to hear a song that I'd never heard before (at the Fountains, of course -  The Star-Spangled Banner is one I've heard plenty of times elsewhere), but I do enjoy every show regardless. I'm aware that some shows have been developed with the music of Tiesto, but I haven't witnessed any of those live yet.\n\nThe best part is that the shows are free. The worst part is the crowds, especially at busier vacation times. Do expect to have to wait between shows for prime viewing spots. My favorite vista is actually near the top of the path curving around the lake because you have a great view of the central circle of the fountains. The obvious next best zone includes any of the half-circles on the Strip sidewalk near the center, but especially the huge inward arc in the very middle. Don't get caught toward the sides or else you won't be able to see the main line of fountains very well.\n\nIf you've somehow never made it to Las Vegas, make this a must-see. If you've traveled to Vegas without seeing the Fountains at Bellagio, fix that mistake next trip. If you're a local, brave the crowds once in a while for this. Long story short, this is one of the best things to see. And do try to pay attention instead of just taking photos or videos.
