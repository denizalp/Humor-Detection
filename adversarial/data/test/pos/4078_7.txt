As a follow up to a recent visit - several attempts were made to contact Arizona Pain Specialists to get copies of the records and have them destroyed. The first phone call resulted in being transferred three times and then hung-up on.  Calling back, being place on terminal hold.  This facility is unbelievably horrible at customer service and compassionate patient care.\n\nIf this were the last medical facility on the planet, I would self-diagnose with Google and get better results.
