Pretty decent AYCE sushi for the area.  They a semi confusing menu which includes nigiri, rolls and some other dishes for the AYCE portion.  There's select items only for non AYCE or dinner one time orders only.  The fish was decent and they didn't give you a large amount of rice with each piece like other AYCE places.  Staff was pretty good and fast.  You also get dessert with the AYCE, including unlimited ice cream!  Overall, clean and good restaurant.
