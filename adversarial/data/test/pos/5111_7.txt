There were so many things wrong with this place. Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait 15 minutes to get seated after our scheduled time. First off, let me say that I have lived in Paris and other parts of France but it has been many years.\n\nAMBIANCE: Eclectic decor, imagine black, white, and pink. Unfortunately, my view was of a huge flat screen TV in a gilded frame over the bar with a basketball game playing. If this \"embodies Aurore's vision of an original authentic restaurant\" I'd like to know what bistro in France she had in mind. I'll be going back to Paris soon, so I'll update my review if I am wrong. Also, not so classy to walk by an open tray of silverware (health code violation?) on the way to being seated, of which our hostess later was wrapping in cloth napkins ON the hostess station at the entrance as her side work. Upon being seated, table was bare: NOTHING, no place setting, no candles, nada. What were we waiting for?\n\nFOOD: I was a little surprised (no pun in intended!) to see Italian and other non-French items on the menu such as lasagna and eggplant parmesan. I guess this is what they mean by \"classic French techniques with traditional American influences,\" but again, I'll let you know when I see meatloaf on a Paris bistro menu and eat my words. Forget about the mushroom appetizer; READ: VERY SMALL, as there are only 2 stuffed mushroom caps on the plate. Beforehand, I had asked the waiter if they were portobello, which at first he agreed but then retracted. I can see why. The foie gras was okay, but I would have preferred a seared version of this dish.\n\nWe waited OVER AN HOUR for our entrees to arrive. And even then, my filet, compared to the other diners at the table who ordered the same, was smaller and overcooked. The sauce was very nice and I can see how this was part of the chef's training. I also liked the potatoes au gratin. Unfortunately, this dish is very small for the price: I've had airplane meals in coach bigger than this. Overall, this place is OVERPRICED.\n\nSERVICE: Our waiter had a little bit of an attitude, so this was in line with an authentic French bistro; however, his lack of efficiency and attention to our table was not. He never poured our wine even once after serving it and we never saw him during our long sojourn waiting for our entrees. After he dropped off the entrees, he NEVER came back to even ask how everything was. Actually, he never once asked how anything was. And at the end he only made excuses for why the kitchen could not handle such a busy night. So what's your excuse for poor service?\n\nGordon Ramsay would have a FIELD DAY with this place. Think Amy's Baking Company....everyone here must be in denial of how bad things are. And Ramsay would tear another one on the chef for arrogantly referring to this place as an authentic French bistro \"with reasonably priced food of very high quality served by knowledgeable and attentive staff.\" Maybe people in Surprise who have never traveled internationally or even eaten in an excellent restaurant may think this place is the balls, but she's not fooling me.
