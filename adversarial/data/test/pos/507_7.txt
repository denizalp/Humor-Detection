Flashback - 1980's Wendy's Hamburger commercial - lil ol' grandma peering @ an anorexic burger exclaiming. \"WHERE's THE BEEF?!\"... Well i'm happy to say the great slogan is back with slight modification. WHERE's THE CUSTOMER SERVICE?!\n\nGreat selection of products, but the staff... oh the staff! Have tried this store a few times and each time they disappoint.\n\nFor ex. lengthly personal conversations amongst adolescent staff trumps service; standing @ the cash... with no one willing to ring your order in, etc.. \n\nOn a side note, if you persistently stalk the help they may cave in. Knowledgeable, but could do without the obvious disdain. \n\nIf you must shop here, get in and get out quickly! And please please please DO NOT BOTHER THE STAFF - they don't like to be disturbed!
