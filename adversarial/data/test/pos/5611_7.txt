Nothing great. Way over priced for what you get. Not my idea of good Italian food.  Tasteless. the pizza's are ok. Period. I like to give a place more than one chance and I gave this one 5 chances. I'm nice that way. Plus I needed to explore their menu in order to give a good, not reactionary, review. I'm also not impressed with the, ermmmm, slightly unhygienic practices in the kitchen. I know why ive needed the bathroom so quickly after eating a meal there...They clearly need lessons on food handling. My last meal was a pasta dish and I chose gluten free pasta. It was horrid! Dried out chicken, almost all the pasta was broken into wee pieces and tasted stale for lack of a better word. I eat gluten free so I know what I am talking about. Also, during my last and final visit I witnessed people at two other tables returning food. Oh! I forgot to mention the salad. It too was tasteless ! How can that be? I've no idea. I can tell you that the dressing seemed to be only olive oil. And the wait staff always seem confused and they are slow. It's sad really because the location is lovely.
