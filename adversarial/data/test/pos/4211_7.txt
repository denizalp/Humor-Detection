It was a sad day when Bosa 1 closed, but I'm glad they're finally back as Pho Bosa. They still have some of the best affordable food in town and portions that will satisfy the hungriest of appetites. The broken rice is like tiny little morsels of heaven. The dishes are as good as I remember with the grilled pork, Korean short ribs, and shrimp cakes being some of my favorites. The b√∫n is just as amazing as the rice. I haven't tried the pho yet but that gives me another reason to come back.
