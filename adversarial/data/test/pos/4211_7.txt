Can I make this 0 stars? I have never been so appalled in my life within the first 30 seconds of entering an establishment.....I had a server named Jessica who has dark red hair and a very bad attitude. My girlfriend and I walked in to this steak house which I assumed was nice and before we ordered our wine we asked for glasses of water (with lemon) clearly she was not ready to work or excited to take care of a table of two non elders .....so as she walked over to her water boy she said \"another water with lemon\" in such a condescending tone I was disgusted....I immediately got up and left and will never be back
