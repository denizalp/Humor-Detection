Only two complaints I can offer is housekeeping is very slow and do not offer daily services without basically demanding them. I was here for business and had suites on two floors - 8 & 12. The staff on 8 is definitely much more receptive to guest needs. \n\nBed was amazing comfortable. Could have used more than three pillows on a king. Stingy with towels. \n\nSecond complaint is bell service is a joke and extremely slow. Even tipping them doesn't seem to get them to move faster. Requested assistance to move luggage between suites on separate floors and it took over 90 mins. Upon checking out requested bell service the night before and was told it would be 10 mins max as I was checking out at 6 am. Called for bell man at 545 am and finally arrived at 655 am. \n\nShuttle to and from airport was amazing. The gentleman who drives is very funny and helpful. \n\nFront desk seemed more interested in checking different rates of each guest versus providing quick service but adequate. A member of my party is a AGM of a well known clothing company and he could tell you more on what he saw as issues that I didn't notice. \n\nElevators were relatively fast. Night guard was hit or miss. When they call a guest to see if so and so is a meme bet if their party who left their key in the room they could let them up versus era is demanding guest come down -- you did just call the room. \n\nBut all in all the hotel is great and will come back as soon as tradeshow WWDMAGIC comes back to town next year.
