Believe it or not, this might have been my first time eating at this franchised restaurant.  We had our small company Christmas lunch here today.  The sun is out but it is chilly.  But, not as chilly inside the restaurant.   I suspect when we got there the ambient temperature was 55 degrees.  If any patrons had worn an outer garment into the establishment, they were still wearing it.  I did not wear a coat and  my feet to my hands were chilled.\n\nThe service was good and the lunch menu is priced competitively.  Nice decorum but, sorry, I just cannot get that excited about standard Mexican food.  All I see is an extra 2\" around my waistline without much payoff.  I mean, like 15 gingerbread cookies are delish and you know there is a price to pay.  But, seeing a visually uninspired enchilada with cheese and beans and still having to work an extra hour in the gym does not motivate me to go back.\n\nMaybe that is why margaritas are so popular in Mexican restaurants....if you get buzzed enough, who cares?
