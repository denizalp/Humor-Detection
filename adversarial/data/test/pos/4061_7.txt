Muy Rica! The food brings back memories of Little Havana from our trip in 2013.\nThe HUGE Cubano is easily enough for 2 people. Syaked on crust bread with of course traditional pork , cheese and taa daw pickle this sandwich is the  real deal.  We were more than please with our food. \nExtra bonus is the generous pieces of postres , desserts such as flan , tres gracias cake, eclairs and more. We shared and were satisfied with the rich but not fake tasting flan and tres gracias cake. I look forward to going back. \nMy one wish is  that they would put in a soda fountain instead of cans but I can deal,  no problema.
