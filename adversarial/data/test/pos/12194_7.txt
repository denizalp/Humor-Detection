I bought a truck from these fools (so who's the bigger fool?) 3.5 years ago. It was a total piece of crap that hadn't been through any kind of acceptance inspection, and it wasn't even the truck I'd wanted: \"Oh, sorry, we *just* sold it,\" you know, the usual bait-and-switch. Three months later, they started calling me 2-3x weekly to trade it back for something more expensive. I told them to foff and never call me again. They continue to call me AT WORK, most recently this afternoon. I left their sales department a loud, angry voicemail and sent them a note through their website. An hour later, I got the world's most sarcastic email from Michael \"Superman\" Kildoo asking if I was inquiring about a vehicle. I replied that no, I wanted them to STOP HASSLING ME. Superman then came right back at me saying it's my fault that they're calling me and that all I had to do was ask to be put on their Do Not Call list. WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THREE MOTHERGRABBING YEARS.\n\nScrew you, Superman, and screw all you idiots at Camelback Ford. You suck.\n\nETA: 3 hours after I posted this review, they called me AGAIN. That's it, I'm lawyering up. This is beyond incompetence and into blatant harassment.
