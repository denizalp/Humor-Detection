I often end up here...but not by choice.  Kosher-eating family + limited Las Vegas kosher restaurants = many, many Panini Cafe visits.  It seems like every restaurant in Las Vegas serves meat, shellfish and bald eagle (kosher joke, ha ha?).\n\nThe menu is dairy kosher (meaning they serve dairy but no meat) and focuses on mostly Israeli-style cuisine with some pasta and sandwiches thrown in for good measure. I generally order the Creamy Eggplant (roasted eggplant with marinara and cheese), hummus (soo good) or the Nicoise salad (okkayyy).  They also serve fish if you're lookin' for some protein.\n\nOverall, the food is decent and healthy but, I wouldn't come here if it wasn't Kosher.\n\nPlease note that if you wear a red halter top to this restaurant you're going to get some HARD and COLD stares.  It caters to the Orthodox of Summerlin.  \n\nThey are also closed from Friday evening and all day Saturday.
