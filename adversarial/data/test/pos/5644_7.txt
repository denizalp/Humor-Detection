I almost don't want to tell you guys about this place. Such is my greed to have a seat when I go back. Think \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" as far as the smallness and inconspicuousness of the place (in a strip mall). But just like in \"Jiro\" (who's place is tucked away in the Tokyo subway) this place delivers big on sushi satisfaction. \n\nPrices are very solid for what you get. We were going to get some straight sashimi, but the bento boxes looked so good and were such an amazing value we went that way. Salmon teriyaki, 6-piece sashimi, rice, soup and salad. The sashimi came out first SEPARATE from the bento box. It was not an after-thought. it was in a bowl on it's own bed of ice and was amazing and fresh. The chef also sent over a complimentary creamy cucumber and crab salad with sesame seeds that was out of this world. The service was so friendly that it felt like we'd been there before. To top it all off, they also gave us a complimentary mochi and whip cream dessert at the end of the meal that took me to sushi\/japanese cuisine nirvana. \n\nIt's hard to squeeze 5 stars out of me, but this place did. I can imagine doing a \"Groundhog Day\" (remember Bill Murray in that?) where I came back to this place every day at the same time forever... and that would be just fine. Save me a seat. I'm coming back.
