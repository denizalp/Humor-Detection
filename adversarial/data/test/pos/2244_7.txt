Guns Etc. has a great selection. However the retail space seems cramped. The prices are decent, but not really known for having bargains. \nSome of the staff are top notch, but some of them seem to be lacking in knowledge or service. I don't mind if a person isn't knowledgeable, but don't try to make up for lack of knowledge with an abundance of B.S. \n\nHonestly the selection and the couple of excellent sales people are what make shopping here worthwhile.
