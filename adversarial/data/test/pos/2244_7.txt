I really enjoyed my pedicure at Instyle Nails.  There was a little wait but I was a walk in so 15 minutes was not too bad. \n\nThe staff was pleasant did a good job.  The salon was clean and equipment was sanitized and newly opened in front of me.  My favorite was the wax foot wrap, it was such a nice touch.
