I have only been here for lunch. It's close to work and is easy to get to. I have eaten in and taken out and have had quick, friendly service every time. I just get the lunch specials ($8-ish) so I haven't ventured outside of that section of menu, which is kind of boring but I'm happy with getting any kind of decent sushi. I got the Tempura Veggies once and they were a bit greasy so I have avoided them since. The restaurant is clean. I will continue to eat here, someday I will try something on the rest of the menu.
