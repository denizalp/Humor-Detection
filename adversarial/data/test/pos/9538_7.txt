Kock roaches i killed 20 a day for a month and they never reduced my bill. was trying to give a half a star. WORST COMPANY THEY KICK PEOPLE OUT FOR ARGUEMENTS or being to noisy im stuck now with a 4,000 dollar bill. Do not rent here. Lots of bums, there was a shooting once cops are always there for someone. Regular Probation officers try and find people hiding here. \n\nIF YOU LIKE CATS LIVE HERE THEY DRINK FROM THE CRAPPULY POOL\n\nDONT LET THE PAINT FOOL U. SCREW THIS COMPANY BY NOT RENTING.
