Oh my goodness, I've never had dessert so fancy! I would expect nothing less though, from a Japanese dessert house.\n\nFOOD\nThere's a minimum order of $12\/person so be prepared to buy something if you come here. It doesn't have to be dessert as they have some wine and savory foods as well. All of the desserts are $12 each, but you can order a combo for $15 that includes a main dessert and a scoop of sorbet. The menu rotates all the time so this review is for the November 2015 menu.\n\nRingo: Basically apple pie turned into art. The pastry was super flaky and the apple compote was perfect. It's served with a scoop of honey sorbet topped with cinnamon and a sugar apple filled with whipped cream and honey. AMAZEBALLS. This one is a must-try.\n\nCarib: Panna cotta served in a wine glass with fruit. This one was the least worth it due to the small portion. It was still pretty cool served in a wine glass which is covered with a thin piece of chocolate. They pour this warm sauce through the chocolate which melts it and is fun to watch. The fruits are very fresh and the textures in this dessert are nice and varied.\n\nMt. Fuji: Chestnut cream cake. Very light and not too sweet. This was the least interesting due to the flavor. I would not get this again.\n\nSunset: I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a 'pie' but it was more slush. The peach moscato flavor was very strong which was a turn off for this dessert. It was also slightly stressful to eat this one as it melted quickly. Other than that, the pastry was good.\n\nAMBIANCE\nThe shop is small with about 4-5 tables and bar seating. By the time we left, there was a wait. Everything was white and super clean. I loved the wine display case in the entrance and the cool wall art. I felt pretty fancy eating here LOL. Even water was served in fragile glass tumblers with fancy coasters.\n  Even the bathroom was visually interesting! The sink looks like a well complete with rocks, twigs and a porcelain frog. The toilet is Japanese and has those butt washing buttons.\n\nSERVICE\nThe servers are all Japanese with Japanese hospitality. Quietly polite. Checked up on us often and our waters were never empty.\n\nOVERALL\nI was pretty sad that they didn't have the edible menu when I came, but hopefully they'll bring it back again. The parking lot is small and cramped so account for time to find parking.
