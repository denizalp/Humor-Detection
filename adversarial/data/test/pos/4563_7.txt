Sweetspot is a nice addition to this shopping center. Inside is clean and they have tables\/chairs for you to sit and enjoy your ice cream, but it can get really busy inside here, so getting a place to sit can be a bit difficult. The staff is really friendly and great with answering questions about menu items which is good because I had a lot. There were many things on the menu I hadn't heard of before, so it was nice to step out of my comfort zone and try something new. You can make it custom by picking the ice cream and toppings of your choice or go with one of their specialty creations from the menu. I have tried a few of the drinks from here and some I haven't liked while others I have loved. If you are a fan of matcha, it's on point here. I recommend the Matcha N Cream from the specialty ice cream menu. You can watch your creation being made and when the liquid nitrogen is infused with the ice cream it freezes, you get a smoke show, and the ice cream is then creamy with no frozen ice crystals.\n\nCafe Sua Da ($5.50 for regular and $6.50 for large) - Vietnamese Coffee Ice Cream, Grass Jelly, Condensed Milk, Whip Cream and Cacao Powder. The ice cream is the real star here it had such a great flavor. I could enjoy this anytime of the day, but it's the perfect after dinner dessert. \n\nDon't forget to ask for a punch card. After 9 visits you get $5 off of your 10th visit.
