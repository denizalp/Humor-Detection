This is the worst place to eat! The food is just horrible! I went for dinner & was looking forward to the salmon they've been advertising however, I wouldn't feed it to my dog that's how bad it looked. My husband went for the prime rib & was served what looked like dried up beef roast. We spent $35.00 on crap! We will NEVER go there again!
