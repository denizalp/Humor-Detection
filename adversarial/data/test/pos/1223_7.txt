Went here with my friend because I was craving for a good old oreo blizzard and man do I feel bad dragging my friend to this place. I had no idea that it was possible to fail in making something so simple: vanilla ice cream + oreos. When I got my blizzard it was already melting and mushy. The employee didn't even bother turning the cup upside-down like they normally do at other locations. I can't believe I spent $5 for something I didn't even bother eating. At first I thought it was only the top layer of ice cream, but it was the whole so called \"blizzard.\" Definitely not coming here again and I can see why this place has such low reviews. I don't like leaving negative reviews, but when I do write them it is completely deserved. I'll just stick to Yogurtland for now!
