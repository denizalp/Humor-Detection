CLEAN UP ON AISLE 12\n\nWTF is up with this location?  It was 100 degrees outside, but the place was a ghost town.  And I think I know why....the place is D I R T Y!\nThe floor was sticky, littered with smashed fruit, and the tables were similarly filthy.  To top it off, the froyo wasn't as good as the LA  or NYC locations.  It was colder, harder, and icier than normal...perhaps due to the lack of customers.\n\nPass on this location.
