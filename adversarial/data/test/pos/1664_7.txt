I want Yelp to establish some serious ground rules in regards to buffets.\n\nIf you're a woman and weigh less than 150 pounds and you're a man and you weigh less than 185 pounds, you are not allowed to write buffet reviews. Seriously. Maybe Yelp should include a \"Do you weigh less than 150\/185 pounds\" as an additional business tip when it comes time to review buffets. Hating on a buffet because you because you don't like the general \"quality\" of the food is like a fat guy (like me) hating on a tapas restaurant because I don't like the \"quantity\" of the food. \n\nMaybe Yelp should include a \"Do you weigh more than 150\/185 pounds\" as an additional tip if you eat at a tapas-style restaurant? \n\nEnough ranting. All I can say is that Golden Corral is a slightly more expensive, but higher quality (in terms of food) buffet than Hometown Buffet. I like Hometown's seating arrangement better with it's ample amount of booths whereas Golden Corral seems satisfied to be primarily tables to get the customer in and out. As with all buffets, only order water as a drink so you can chow down more and don't forget to bring cash to tip the bussers\/drink servers because there's no option to tip at the register.
