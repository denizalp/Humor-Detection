So.... This is my 4th visit to this place... Love the atmosphere.....2 of 4 visits... Where good.... Drinks... excellent the first 3 times... Tonight really bad.....I used to bartend and whoever is here tonight is....an amateur... Bad mixing.... The customer service lacks a bit.....server seems to have too many tables to be able to give enough attention to his customers... It took way too long to check on us after the food was served and after the drinks.. Which took way too long to be served in the first place....... btw the server multiple times failed to pick up plates we literally sat till the end... As I'm writing this.... With every dish and glass we where served..... They need to polish their service.....
