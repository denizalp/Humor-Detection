I thought that I would hate this show because I don't really find any appeal to magic and magic shows but I loved Penn & Teller!\n\nDuring the entire show, I was wow'd and full of suspense and intrigue and I definitely was entertained for a few hours. Penn & Teller not only are magicians but are amazing actors and Penn is an awesome singer!\n\nAll in all, the theater was nice, the seats were comfy and the show was great! I had a good time!\n\nI was lucky enough that my family purchased tickets for this show as a gift to me so I did not spend a single cent. However, I think that I would probably not have spent $100 on a ticket for this classic Vegas act... I would rather spend that $100 on a Cirque show...
