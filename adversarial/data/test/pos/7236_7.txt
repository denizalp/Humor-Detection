30 min wait for 2 drinks... Add an extra 10 minutes because they skipped my order. 3 groups later they still haven't gotten around to making 2 milk teas... A customer who arrived after me ordered, got his drink, decided he didn't want that flavor, & had it remade before I got my drink order. Lack of customer service and poor work flow will keep me far away from this place. I'd give it -5 stars if I could. Put away that tip jar folks cause you don't deserve it.
