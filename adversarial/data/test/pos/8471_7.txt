I may have to create a new list for places like Bistro La Bon...I think I may call it \"Nom Fest\" because I was in absolute heaven during their Sunday smorgasbord brunch. \n\nOh my goodness oh my goodness...whether you favor gratins or chocolate waffles, lip-smacking french toast or creamy orzo salad, buttery brisket or delectable coconut macaroons, there is something for everybody here. And, honestly, this buffet (for $14.95 per person) is a pretty sweet deal any way you cut it. A few of the standouts in this tasty spread...\n\nMacaroons: ZOMG. I was ready to open my purse and go all covert ops on the buffet to smuggle out a tray of these perfectly crafted coconut macaroons. No joke, they are some of the best I've ever had. \n\nFrench Toast: Buttery, velvety magic. Perfectly made with the right amount of syrup. Just an FYI - you'll have to order the chocolate waffles and this French toast with your server, even though it's included in the buffet price. \n\nSweet Potato Gratin: It sounds as delicious as it tasted. My tastebuds were dancing a jig of massive proportions. \n\nSo, um, yeah, I'll be back to Bistro La Bon in the very near future. NOM!
