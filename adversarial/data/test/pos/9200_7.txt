I'm an odd qu√©becoise, I need to reaaallllyy crave poutine to eat it. I don't just randomly eat it, you see? So when I do want to fall down the poutine-hole, this is where I come.\n\nNo matter what ingredients you pick, it's amazing, although I do think the smashed potatoes are vastly superior. Super efficient service and fair choice of alcohol to make things interesting. The portions are humongous so if you're not the kind of animal who enjoys leftover poutine, go for the small.
