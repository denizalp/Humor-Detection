Being from the West Coast, the first time I heard of White Castle was watching that Harold-and-Kumar-get-really-high-and-need-to-fix-their-munchies movie. After that, I noticed that you could buy them frozen in the supermarket and defrost them to get a fix. When I heard an actual location opened up in Vegas, I made it a point to get there eventually. It took me 3 trips to Vegas to finally go because I was scared away by the potential crowds.\n\nWell, it finally happened. It's located on the outskirts of Casino Royale on the strip, really easy to find by foot.\n\nI came on a Wednesday around 11 am. There was a very short line but the seating area was pretty full. I asked the cashier when it starts getting crazy, and she told me after noon. A hot tip for you guys, earlier is better. The service was great, and the seating area was clean.\n\nI ordered ten sliders with cheese, onion rings, and fries. The fried stuff was meh but the sliders were delicious. Meat, cheese, onion, and a soft roll. They taste better than the frozen ones because they're cooked fresh. The difference isn't that noticeable though. \n\nVerdict: I love their sliders. I don't care that they're mostly bread with very little meat. I'm not coming here to be healthy. \n\nNote: They have cheesecake on a stick. I regret not getting it. They also sell beer.
