WHYYY, GORDON, WHYYY. This place is set up to succeed...but doesn't in my books. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and the presentation was excellent. The taste, not so much.The peppers were nice and spicy but the meat patty, which I got medium since they said the medium rare would be bloody and pink, was too cooked and made everything a bit dry. The bread also looked delicious with its cool sesame stuff but it was a bit spongey and the texture didn't help the burger.\nThe burger was so lackluster that I began to eat it like it was steak..cutting it with a fork and a knife and it was a drag to finish it.\n\nThey have a cool modern way to look at drinks on ipads. I got the green gin tea and it was good but very very bitter. Their specialty cocktails are worth trying imo, though sharing might be best to try different options since they vary widely from one to the other.\n\nThe service was excellent and the server was very friendly and helpful.
