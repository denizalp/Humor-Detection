The owner is VERY annoying. After ordering AYCE she stealthily watches orders\/tables to see what and how much food people are eating. \n\nThe staff, Danny, Brent and Michael are amazing. Sushi is good, but lately it's just not the same. It's just not quality like things used to be. Very upsetting....I really used to enjoy coming here. I don't plan on coming back for awhile, especially when the owner is there. She's just too overbearing. Cheap!!!
