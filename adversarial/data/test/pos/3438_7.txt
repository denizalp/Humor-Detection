This Sukiyaki food court restaurant is located inside Place Montreal Trust at the corner of the food court.\n\nI will sometimes go there when I feel like some ramen or noodle soup and I don't feel like making the trek to Place Ville Marie for the soup at Caravelle (they serve different types of soup but generally when I want a noodle soup, I'm generally feeling under the weather and just want a hot noodle soup)\n\nAs ramen food court soups go, it is okay. They accept credit cards. There is nothing really exceptional about the place.
