Mmmm tableside Peking Duck....This place is definitely one of the better chinese food restaurants who don't serve kitten chow mein and bow wow broccoli. They do have the traditional chinese drab and they also cater to Americans and their ever so sweet orang chicken. The dim sum, next to Cathay house I think are similar. I miss having dim sum partners. Sigh....Oh well. Overall I had them kill a fish. Bass, fry it up and have a hot and spicy\/black bean sauce on the side with sauteed peppers and onions....Mmmm Rice....Yea definitely a step up. However if you don't know where it is, it's not easy to find. Their marketing team kinda sucks. So here's to help you out Chang's and many more meals to come :)
