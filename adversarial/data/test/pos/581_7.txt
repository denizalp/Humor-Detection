Going from Oakland to San Antonio for work I had a quick layover in Phoenix Arizona, I had booked a flight to depart Oakland at 12pm to arrive in San Antonio at 8pm, my flight was first delayed by 2 hours, when I arrived in Phoenix I rushed to the next gate only to find it was closed early with no representative at the gate, thus missing my connecting flight, fine it happens...\n\nWhat happened next is a larger waste of time and money, what should have been an short 5-6 hour flight has turned into a near 24 hour mess, the new ticket I was issued was listed for the wrong time and wrong gate, no announcements were made regarding the new departure time, board listing or gate change, I asked several AA reps to look up the flight as the time approached closer (one guy even refused and just said look at the board) and all claimed the flight was on time and at the same gate, once the AA customer service saw the error they just shrugged and made excuses for why they sucked, no apology given I was forced to travel to an additional layover and a red-eye...\n\nPeople in Phoenix (or at least the people who work in the Phoenix Airport) seemed very rude, inconsiderate, lazy and generally very bad at their job, it's like the airport is where they went to watch their dreams die and choose to drift as useless pieces of crap through life. I usually am pretty lucky traveling, show up early, have all paperwork, go directly to the gate etc. this is the only time I've ever dealt with such low level organisms of this magnitude. I know air travel has been in the decline as far as quality, but I've never had such a negative experience as flying through Phoenix \nThere are no storms, no blizzards in the entire area flying from Oakland to San Antonio, so it's just good ol apathy and incompetence that seems to run that airport... \n\nMaybe it was an off day for all of Phoenix because the Cardinals got destroyed by the Panthers for the NFC championship, but hey you get what you deserve...\n\nPhoenix airport sucks...
