Never was a big fan of Little Caesars Pizza, last time I went to one was over 10 years ago in California BUT with that being said I was in the area running errands getting hungry & decided to clear out my change purse. It was actually decent! You cant beat the price $8 bucks Large Pan Pizza! I was in & out under 5 minutes, so I was stoked about that. Have leftovers & empty change purse lol..I'll go back once in a blue moon :-)
