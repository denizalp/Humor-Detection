Flawless. \n\nI came here to shorten the length and sleeves of a wool coat. There were a lot of little details in the cut and sewing of the original coat and I didn't expect it to be replicated. But when I received the coat back, it was perfect! They put a lot of detail in their work & it shows. Honestly, I couldn't even tell that it was altered. I will come here for any future altercations!
