Great balcony to party on with a view of the Strip!\n\nFull bar and concert stage. Rock music, open bar, free eats, and partying like a boss during a company event!\n\nStore on bottom level with all kinds of Hard Rock merchandise. You have to leave down a staircase that exits through this store. It's like Disney World when you exit a ride. They lure you in to suck money from your wallets on all kinds of shirts and souvenir items. \n\nIt's near the World of Coca Cola and not anywhere near the Hard Rock Casino which does confuse people. It's right on the Strip. Was here recently for a client sponsored event. Tons of free food (bbq chicken, salads, mac & cheese, dessert station, etc) that were actually pretty tasty. Seems like the food is pretty decent here. Spacious stage area and concert floor. Cool memorabilia and posters on the walls. Large bar area with a nice selection of tap and canned\/bottled beer.\n\nI drank Dos Equis all night on the balcony overlooking the neon lights of the Strip and felt like The Most Interesting Man In The World!
