I don't normally go into American Apparel. Mostly because I like vintage and things that are skintight don't look good on me. But, I was dressing up as a mermaid and found myself in need of a top to wear under my shells so I didn't expose too much skin. Of course, American Apparel had all the selection of shiny, skintight (and skin colored) tops I needed. While I feel like I way over-paid for what I got, at least I got what I needed.
