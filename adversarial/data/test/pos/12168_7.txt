It's not as run down as most of the CEC's I've been to before and there's a lot of parking even a creepy back alley of parking spaces (don't park there!). With that being said I just can't stand this place. It's loud, the food is terrible (unless you get the salad bar), most of the games are out of order and does anyone watch their kids?? \n\nI see the allure to have birthday parties here, it's a one stop shop. You show up and they do everything for you. I mean what party isn't complete without a dancing rat and obnoxious party host? Kinda generic if you ask me. You'll be better off going to The Mini Grand Prix, Pump It Up, Bounce U, or The Discovery Museum for a far better experience. But much to my chagrin, I can't deny my kids love it here so I get suckered into taking them. I hope they'll change their mind about this place soon but until then I guess I'll have to suck it up. Sensory overload ugh!! :\/
