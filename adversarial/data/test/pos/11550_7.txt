Okay... Been flying past this place next to the Rainbow Cactus and not wanting to stop, but today's the day! Flashy neon sign tells me ... \"GOD LOVES YOU \/ WHY NOT SHARE A HAPPY HEART? \/ JESUS IS ALIVE. So I cautiously slide in the front door. Chicago style? I'm thinking deep dish, and my hopes are dashed quickly, and told that theirs is 'thin' crust, bummer.\nGod loves you Jesus is alive\nOkay I need to loss weight (I'm at 190#) but it was a very tight fit into the horseshoe booth as I burned the roof of my mouth on melting cheese. And boy let me tell you, they put alot of cheese on these pies. But the sauce is a little sweeter than my NYC preference but all-in-all a nice place, they won me over.
