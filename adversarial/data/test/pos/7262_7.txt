What can you say about a Dollar Tree except this one is better stocked than most with better selections. \n\nOnly problem we had today was the cashier did not know how to handle a large bill when presented to him and he called the manager who proceeded to acknowledge the call but failed to do anything about it. As a result, we ended up standing there, there was only one cash register open and everyone ended up waiting and a rather lengthy line did develop.
