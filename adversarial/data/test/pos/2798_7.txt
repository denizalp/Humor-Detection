Okay so once in a while I don't feel like squeezing myself into a pair of but-clenching jeans, sucking in my belly, and flirting with somebody pointlessly for the night only to go home to a headache and a snoring boyfriend. \n\nAnd guess what?  When it's one of those nights, I like bowling!  Bowling is a sport that needs to be treated as one and those who don't take it seriously should not go to Bathurst Bowlerama.  On any given Saturday night this five-pin firehouse is packed with a clientele most suitable for a remake of Cocoon, bowling their hearts out and loving it.   The joy this activity brings to them is heart-warming and I am so overtaken by their enthusiasm that my bowling has improved (I was even asked to join their league).\n\nIf the bowling experience doesn't do it for you, the kitsch factor of the place will, and if that doesn't do it for you, then a chocolate offering out of one of the league ladies' boxes of Russell Stover will forever seal your relationship with this Toronto institution.
