If you've ever talked to anyone who eats in Toronto, it seems like everyone has ate there except me. When I say I have never been there people look at me like I'm from another planet. So the opportunity presented itself to eat at Canoe. And it is worth the odd stares.\n\nI would recommend to anyone that hasn't been there to at least try it. Although it is expensive, it is not as outrageously expensive as I thought. Lunch courses are between 20-30 which isn't that bad. What will make your experience more expensive is if you order an appetizer ($10-$20) and of course alcohol.\n\nMost of the stuff on their menu includes words I don't know the meaning of. Shows my high end dining knowledge. 2 of the 3 in our party ordered the specials of the day. One was a pasta something something, I had some beef of some sort, and the 3rd dish was perch. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food and all the flavours mixed in. I don't know how many ways you can cook a roast of beef, but somehow the slices of beef I had were amazing.\n\nWhat I like about high end restaurants is that when you get your nicely presented dish, there seems to be more \"filler\" stuff then there is actual the food. You look at it and go \"that's it\". Yet after you eat the dish you are satisfied. It seems like at the lower end restaurants you have to eat a lot to be satisfied. Maybe its just me.\n\nI was impressed with the speed of their service. We were sat down, ordered, ate, and paid the bill in about an hour. They were extremely prompt with things and I'm sure they make an effort to get people on their way back to work.\n\nPut 5 stars on the board for this place.
