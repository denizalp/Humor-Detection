I had stopped going to this place when it was still called Beatniq. We went back last week and I really enjoyed how the renovation in the basement has made it much more pleasant.\n\nYou will enjoy the music, the atmosphere, the service, the drinks and the food of course!\nFor weekends, make sure you check their website and events calendar. If you are going for the music in the basement, go early cause it can fill up really fast, especially if there is a good band performing.\n\nGo on the weeknights, when there is open mic, and you will love it!
