I bought a facial from groupon for this place. It was HORRIBLE. I have had many facials from other places, so I have plenty to compare it to. I am always a very good tiper and I left after without tipping.\n\n1. the girl who did my \"facial\" walked out of the room three times... the first time I had the mister on my face and it was only on one side of my face and basically misting my ear for 12 minutes while she was out... the second time she left for 5 minutes while I had a semi-warm towel on my face... and the third time she left the room she left a cold COLD towel on my face.\n2. Having a facial is supposed to be relaxing and soothing quiet music should be played. This girl played techno (no joke) and then Sade and then some rap and then Norah Jones. I also received a small concert from her because she knew all the words to the songs played and sang along.\n3. She poked me in the eye twice pretty hard. She was also trying to get the last bit of product from one of the containers and while shaking it hit me in the head and nose.\n4. The product used was cheap CHEAP! I came home and showered and washed my face immediately after my \"facial\".\n5. She was trying to make small talk, but failed because she asked me about my job six times. I'm on maternity leave...\n\nShe was horrible! The place was so loud it was the opposite of relaxing!. I will never go back!
