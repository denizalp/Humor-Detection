Excellent service. Excellent food.\n\nEverything here was perfect so I'll just mention the few things I did not love.\n\nThe Vegetable Ratatouille which is just a side didn't really wow me.\n\nThe Chocolate Souffl√© needs some more cream or some ice cream.\n\nThe Bone in Ribeye is amazing!! Ask for the sauces on the side and ask for some pepper on the side! It will be 3 different types of cracked pepper. Awesome.\n\nThe Escargot dish and the Foie Griot was both amaZing!! Like cream in your pants type amazing. Can I say that on yelp? That just happened!!!\n\nShut YO FACE!!!!\n\nThis is a small restaurant. Much smaller than expected. The service was great. Tops.\n\nTip: Order a la carte.
