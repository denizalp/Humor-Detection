I stopped in to Rambo's on a whim on Saturday April 5 since I was in the area and there were some good reviews from people I know on Yelp.  I'm glad I did.  I was talked into the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich by my server and she assured me the pork was fresh and never frozen.  I have to tell you, I believe her; this was one damn tasty sandwich.  Instead of the included french fries or some other fried dish that has escaped my memory I chose a house salad which was fresh and came in a classic wooden bowl like I used to have has a kid.  The Italian dressing was decent but nothing to write home about.\n\nService was very attentive from the tag team duo of Tammy and Misty.  I was checked on in a consistent and friendly manner and they kept the 60\/40 split Arnold Palmers flowing.  That's all I ask.\n\nThe ambiance inside was interesting; I'm not sure what the theme was supposed to be but to be honest I didn't give it much thought or attention since I was sitting outside on the patio.  If I'm ever in the area again I will definitely stop back in for another meal.\n\np.s. If Misty tells you some of her famous home-made peanut butter brownie squares are available, take her up on the offer; that brownie was delicious even though I waited until the next day to eat it.
