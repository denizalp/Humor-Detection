If you're over the age of 30, don't waste your time or money at this place unless you're single and want to pick up someone much younger than you are.  \n\nI was celebrating a friend's birthday last night and had some hope that the vintage music floor would have me dancing and reminiscing for hours, partying like it's 1999.  It didn't happen.  The website says vintage is played downstairs on a Saturday night, but all that was playing was rap and hip hop.  Our group moved upstairs where the vintage music appeared to be playing.  However, we didn't hear any more than 10-30 seconds of any one song (nothing older than early 90's), as the DJ just mixed them all and kept everything at the same tempo for most of the evening.  This was extremely disappointing.  What happened to the days when you could hear an entire song and enjoy a wide variety of great tunes?  And remember when there used to be slow songs at the end of the night?  We didn't stick around long enough to find out, but I'm certain this didn't happen.\n\nPaying an $8 cover charge plus $3 for coat check sucks.  And why are we standing in a line-up outside when we're on a guest list?  That system needs to be fixed.   I could smell puke in random places and sweaty boy armpits in others.  The belt that belonged to my coat wasn't returned and I would never bother to get it back.  If it was on that floor, it should be burned.  Some of the attitudes and behaviors of these young folks included far too much assertiveness, aggression and pompousness.  Oh, please.  I just want to be around fun and respectful adults, even if they are strangers.  And I left there with my ears ringing.  \n\nThe only pleasant surprise about Commonwealth was that one of the bartenders was fabulously patient and friendly.  We only went to him for drinks and I wish I knew his name so I could share it with you.  He had a lot of tattoos on his arms and one of them included Mickey Mouse.  \n\nIt's clear that many youthful Calgarians enjoy this place, but it's definitely not for me.
