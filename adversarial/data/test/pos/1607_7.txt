Cheap, cardboard pizza.  Back in the day when this plaza had Benny Shapiros, Baskin Robins and Peaches it probably would of been shut down quick.  Those were some heavy hitters back in the day.  Crazy bread is still good but not like in the 80's and 90's.  There is still the porn store across the street so you can make it a double-banger if that's how you roll.  Got kicked out of here once for indecent exposure, but I quit that.  All good now...
