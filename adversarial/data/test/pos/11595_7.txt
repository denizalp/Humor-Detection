My friend has been going to this location for a few months and trying (unsuccessfully) to get me to go. I thought on it. I thought on it and finally I gave in last month. I figured I sometimes like to play the healthy game and I should go and get this done. I was a little curious. \n\nWhen I first arrived I decided to get a detox foot bath. I was instantly asked if I would like water or some tea. I opted for the tea. Bad idea! The tea was fabulous and I bet all of you will love it. My friend does. She enjoys it. However, my hands started to shake from it and I could feel my anxiety rise. So if you are already nervous, perhaps your first time stick to the water. \n\nThe detox foot bath was interesting. My feet started to itch from the impulses in the water, but not too bad to be annoying. The water got DISGUSTING. Which it is supposed to! They do tell you the water would change colors regardless and you should read the flyer in the room. They lowered the lights and only checked in once. It was really relaxing and as I was stressing about my next step, well... it was a good start. \n\nMy lovely technician entered and I was soon on my way to the colonic. It was just a comedy of errors from there. They let you maintain your modesty by inserting the device. However, being (1) nervous (2) unfamiliar and (3) a girl of some substance (aka fat). I couldn't get it in. So this stranger had to help with angling and we were now best friends. I mean this is normally something I leave to AFTER someone has bought me dinner and for that kind of thing? Jewelry. \n\nNow the procedure started. At first it was just a strange feeling of water going where water shouldn't be. Then I started sweating and getting intense pains. I started to rethink every moment in my life that had led me to this point. I felt like my poor insides were being ripped open. Then I did that whole 'push' thing. Let's just say.... modesty is over. I refused to do it while she was in the room, so I think she sensed my panic and horror and left. I was given a warm compress for my abdomen. \n\nThen I noticed the tube. I was a little sad I didn't watch what came out from the beginning. My poor insides felt like every bad hentai movie I had heard of. It was painful and horrible. So you are thinking why the review number? Just wait for it. It will be legendary. She comes back in and puts in some probotics right when I was like please Lord let this stop. See? I found a lot of religion in that first session. I prayed I wouldn't die. I prayed it wouldn't kill me. You know all the prayers. When relief came and it was over. I stood up and handled the rest of the business.\n\nI was a little light headed when I got up (which also could have been from the earlier tea). Then I went to pay and ... wait for it... got more sessions. Yes. I was curious why I said yes too.\n\nMy SECOND session (I know this is a long review) was completely different. I just drank water, I turned down the tea. That left me less shaky feeling (again, this is JUST me I think. My friend loves it). I figured out how to insert and it was far less traumatic. I knew what to expect and the pain wasn't even close to bad. In fact, I felt like I could fall asleep during the process. It was a night and day difference. I made jokes more this time and used the massager which was amazing. So all in all, it's a must do. I feel better. My mind feels less hazy and I really do feel detoxified. Each time I get one done it's like I feel a little more clean and a little more comfort. I would completely recommend this place.
