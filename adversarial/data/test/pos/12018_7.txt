It's a biker bar.  Drunk biker girl had to be hauled off, she should have been cut off much earlier.   Do not recommend if you want a quiet lunch.\nSeating uncomfortable, decent food, chilli did not have any flavor, pulled pork sandwich was tastey, but the bread was soggy.  The cornbread was awesome, beer was cold.\nThe server, Adrian, was excellent.
