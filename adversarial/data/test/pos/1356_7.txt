I've been to this particular buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner over the past year, and feel it's a solid three stars. The selection is pretty good but dinner has been underwhelming- lunch is your best option.\n\nBreakfast: Typical breakfast buffet selection. On weekends you may luck out and find shrimp and grits, which is done excellently here. Other than that, it's just fine. Nothing in particular stands out.\n\nLunch: Best time to go, selection is large and you'll have most of the dinner options. Start with massive salad bar, end with a smorgasbord of desserts including a gelato bar. The Mexican food options are surprisingly solid.\n\nDinner: Underwhelming. Little to differentiate it from lunch options. Seafood selection (my favorite) is limited, sushi quality is comparable to a grocery store, shrimp are small and not very clean. \n\nService is consistently good, and you can find locals discounts pretty easily. Always surprised by how busy this place is.
