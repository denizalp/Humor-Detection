The club DJ's have been awful every time I've been. The music is always really hard core rap no hop hip or top 40. It's hard to dance to unless your only dancing abilities are twerking. The other part I find really annoying the floor is SOOOO GROSS! I've been to plenty of clubs I know drinks get spilt. No one ever heard of a mop? So gross and so sticky it made my shoes stick to things even after I left. My last complaint is more a preference but I find the crowd to be nothing but Two thing 1. Barely 21 yr old men and women who are just disrespectful, trashy people most of them are attractive yes, but their personality are so SOO bad or 2. Really really old men who are going after the pretty twinks . It's gross and very creepy. I've watched someone follow me around from afar all night just starring and right before I left he asked if I'd wanna be a house boy.  Just not one or my favorite places the chances of me returning are slim to none.\n=\\
