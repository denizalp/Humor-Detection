First of all, disappointing.\n\nSushis and service were ok until I pay the bill. \n\nI don't know if I looked like a tourist that evening, but the waitress gave me a weird reaction when I gave her about 20% tip. She even tried to block my way after I had paid the bill. It's the first time something like this happen to me in a restaurant.\n\nThis is not happening again for sure.
