The Encore just oozes opulence, and without a doubt it's one of the most luxurious resorts to stay at in town.\n\nLet me first address service. While waiting in line for a few minutes to be assisted at the front check in desk, we were kindly offered small bottles of water -- props on taking care of guests! The front desk staff was also professional and amiable, and they made checking in a breeze.\n\nThe Panorama View King room that we booked had a clean contemporary style with subtle Asian influences. I loved the spaciousness of the separate living and sleeping spaces; plus, the view of The Strip wasn't bad either. The bed was comfortable with plush comforters and pillows. In the bathroom, the shower head was really powerful and did a good job of blasting off casino-funk. Though the walls weren't paper thin, I still heard people talking and toilets flushing in neighboring rooms. \n\nUpgrade to a room located on a higher floor, if possible. Don't just do it for the views, but do it to minimize the sound of pounding EDM beats that travel up from Surrender.\n\nOverall, my experience here was a positive one. If you're seeking that luxurious Las Vegas experience, the Encore could be one of your best bets on The Strip.
