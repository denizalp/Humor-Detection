I put in an inquiry on a car, they had the exact one I wanted. I have a brand new 2014 nissan maxima limited edition fully loaded besides nav and leather. Owned it for 6 months the internet manager told me my trade in value was only 21k. So he is saying a car that I bought for sticker price of 34k dropped 13k in 6 months. He is out of his mind, KBB doesn't have my cars blue book out yet so I am assume he thought he could pull one over. It is impossible for a car to drop 13k in 6 months. He told me he was sorry that I got taken for lol. Which is impossible because for one I have sold cars and I know how the industry works and two the bank goes by Loan To Value of a car. If the car you are trying to finance is more than the its value the bank will not finace the loan. So if I bought my car 13k over priced the bank would not have finaced it. I KBB the previous year and a 2013 blue books for more than what they were quoting a 2014? Out of their mind. So beware of a low ball trade in value on your trade in make sure you know what it is worth.
