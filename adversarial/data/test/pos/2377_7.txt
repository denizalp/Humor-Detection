Don't look----just eat.  Don't think---just eat. \n\nOh, I hate those silly cleanliness thoughts that come through my head.  Will this place kill me?  \n\nGood food.  I mean, we are not talking haut cuisine here.  But, sometimes, you just want deep fried fish in your burrito.  Really good.  I hope it won't kill me....
