This is hard for me.  Because I had a bad time at this club about a year ago and then the owner Mike contacted me and \"made it right.\"  So I felt so loyal to go.  This club just looks so AWESOME.    Plus the fact its open until 3:30am makes it great!  The DJ is good too.  The bouncers have treated me good.  Drink specials can be good too.  Lastnight was Saturday night and it was $1.00 ANY drink AND FREE Admission till 12 midnight.  I've spent nearly $10,000.00 in this club within the past year.  I always get bottles.  Typically I would deal with a guy named Lito.  It was so easy to deal with him. I'd txt him...tell him what I needed and when.  That was it...done.  Apparently something happened with Lito and he is no longer in charge of VIP\/Bottle service.  A girl named Nicole Palumbo has no taken it over.  Nicole called me and left me a message a few weeks ago to see if I was coming to VIP.  I was out of town on business so I couldnt make it then.  Saturday Aug 06 at about 6pm I put on Zen's facebook page that I would please like a bottle of Kettle One UPSTAIRS.  I then called the VIP # that I have.  10pm I never hear back from Zen but tell my 3 girlfrineds and 1 male friend to meet me at Zen.  We all have good job and just wanted a night out.  I've never had a problem with the dress code at Zen.  I wear Abercrombie shirts ...flip flops...Under Armour visor...all pink.   It's just me.  I play football and wear business suits for work.  I just wanna sporty comfy. My male friend had on dress slacks and dress shirt.   The 3 girls I was with had dresses on.  About midnight I go looking for the VIP waitress to see I can purchase the bottle now.  I see the DJ who says HELLO BRANDI.   So that was coool.  I also found one waitresss who said that they were gettin my bottle.  I said okay I will be over at the bar.  I returned to my friends and continued to talk to them.  About 30mins later NICOLE PALUMBO finds me at the bar and tells me that there is no room upstairs unless I want to purchase *3* bottles.  I said NOOOOOOOO I dont' need 3 bottles.   There was only 5 in my group and it was like 2am at this point.  I think said...\"No biggy....if you can just bring the bottle down here and bring a few bracelettes so I can use the restroom upstairs...that would be awesome.\"   I was happy.  I was in such a great mood.  20 mins later.....3 big bouncers and Joe come and tell me that I've gotta leave.  I asked wy but they couldnt give me an answer.  I then sai d...\"ok..no biggy let me crab my friends here...and I will gladly leave.\".  We left .....walked a few blocks...and went to CLUB WHIM and FINALLY got our BOTTLE!  They treated us so good over at Whim.  I am not sure whats up with Zen.  I think it might have been racial.  I am going to file a lawsuit tomorrow morning.  I also contacted the LCBO.   Please if you have had any problems...email me unixgirl@Hotmail.com
