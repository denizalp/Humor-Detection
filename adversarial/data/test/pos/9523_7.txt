I probably would have rated EL Ruddy Co higher if I was in fact, vegan. I'm not, I love meat, but that is not quite the reason for just a three star rating.\n\nThis is a tiny place and only seats around 15 people or so. I ordered a plain omelette with a side salad. It was probably my fault for ordering something a bit boring, but the food was just that - quite bland and boring. My dining companions were a bit more adventurous and seemed to enjoy their food moreso than I did.\n\nThe hipster waitstaff here were very, very nice and friendly. Coffee was topped up often so I kept well caffeinated which is never a bad thing.\n\nThe bathrooms downstairs were quite grody and there was a giant dandy long legs staring at me as I peed, but it added to the charm and character of this cafe.
