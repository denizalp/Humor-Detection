Note: It's been a few months since my husband and I attempted to dine here. I have waited to write the review since I didn't want it to come from an angry place. Hopefully my reaction now is reasonable lol. \n\nI was excited to try out Cinnamon's since I enjoyed their Waikiki location and shared their opening news with out-of-town friends who would be visiting us. Unfortunately, Cinnamon's left us very disappointed and I will not be going back. Reading other reviews, I knew to be patient with the service. A very large party had come in right before us, the staff told us that they had no warning of them and they had taken up one side of the restaurant. They said the wait on food would be longer than usual (about 30 minutes), which we were fine with. We placed our order and received our # and receipt. I wanted to grab something already made and small to tide us over in the meantime, so I ordered a slice of banana bread separately. The cashier put that on the same # as our original order. The banana bread was delivered a few minutes later and I made sure to tell the server that delivered it that this was not our full order, and we were waiting for the items we ordered on our first receipt so there was no confusion. She let us retain our # card. 30 minutes came and went and still no food. We started seeing others who had ordered after us get our food, so we brought this to the attention of the original server who delivered my banana bread and one of the servers wandering around (they didn't seem to have any dedicated servers to a table, it looked like any one could hop in and help you). For the next 30 minutes, we realized all the servers around us were actively avoiding our table, refilling the waters of everyone else around us, but not our table and avoiding eye contact with us even when we tried to flag them down. No one seemed to want to take responsibility for our order. We talked to the cashier who originally took our order and said it would be right up and there was a mistake and our ticket was lost. Another 30 minutes pass. I was shocked to see that they didn't make our ticket a priority, as they continued to provide food to others who ordered after us. We spoke with the assistant manager who apologized and said she would check on our food again. At this point it had been 90 minutes since we ordered and we really were tired of waiting and asked for a refund. She offered us a bag of chips for our next visit, but I thought that was a big assumption to make on her part that we could come back again. I know she meant well, but our time was wasted and it was bizarre that the staff was avoiding taking the reigns to resolve the issue. We asked to speak with the restaurant manager. The manager came from out of the kitchen with a \"What more do you want from us?\" attitude, even though this was literally the first time we were speaking to him. I was trying to explain to him the most upsetting issue regarding the service and he just didn't seem to care and seemed like we were bothering him.  My biggest gripe was that I had foreseen this issue and proactively spoke to a server about it to make sure our ticket did not get lost. The assistant manager was much more concerned and apologetic, letting us know the staff would be retrained on these escalated issues. We left the restaurant very frustrated and hungry, but at least we got to try out The Bagel Cafe nearby. I know there can be a lot of issues with franchise expansions, but this location did not have the aloha spirit and service I saw in Hawaii or that I would expect from any business.
