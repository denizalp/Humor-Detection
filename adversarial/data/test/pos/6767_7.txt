A couple weeks before a recent trip to Phoenix, I saw a picture of a delicious-looking Bloody Mary somebody posted on Facebook. I saw that it came from a place called Lux Central in Phoenix, and when I looked it up on Yelp I noted its strong reviews and determined to eat there when I was in town. I dragged my husband across town with promises of brunch, not realizing the place was more of a coffee shop with food and booze than an actual restaurant.\n\nWe walked in and took a lap around the space, noting the lack of tables, and the near absence of available chairs. I don't think I've ever seen so many people with laptops in a coffee shop all at once, and I hail from L.A., land of the Starbucks screenplay. I liked the vibe of the place--pretty hip, even strikingly hipster, especially by Phoenix standards. Eclectic furniture, lots of art on the walls. There was a register for coffee, pastries, and hot food, and a separate bar in the back. We were looking to have more of a sit-down brunch, and actually left to go to Pane Bianco instead, only to find that there wasn't much for my picky husband to eat (no pizza at lunch). We circled back and ordered food and cocktails at the bar, then seated ourselves at a communal table.\n\nService, at least, was excellent. Our bartender, a young dude with blondish hair, acted as our waiter, too--wish I'd gotten his name, because he was helpful and friendly and generally wonderful. He ordered our food for us and brought it out, along with our drinks. He also made fantastic cocktails. I got my Bloody Mary and it was totally worth the journey. I have no idea what went into it, but it was spicy and flavorful, with depth and complexity, an umami bomb of a Bloody Mary in a mason jar with salt-frosted rim. Didn't hurt that it came garnished with pickled asparagus, green bean, and carrot, along with jalape√±o slices and a fistful of candied bacon--out of control delicious. There was no cocktail menu, but our bartender asked what my husband was in the mood for, and fixed him a beautiful, balanced Aviation--a lavender-colored cocktail with gin, creme de violette, maraschino liqueur, and lemon juice, garnished with a fancy cocktail cherry.\n\nThe food was less exciting, but serviceable enough. I had Aunt Ida's Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits were buttery with a nice crumble, and I liked the hearty sausage gravy. My husband got some toast with butter and jam, and supplemented that with a croissant. He wasn't particularly impressed with any of it.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend Lux Central for its food, but it's a cool coffee shop with a knockout bar. I'd love to come back for another round of drinks next time I'm in Phoenix. I just wouldn't show up looking for a sit-down meal on an empty stomach.
