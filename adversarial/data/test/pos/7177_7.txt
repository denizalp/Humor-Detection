I had a pretty nice fish tank when I lived in Kent. Most of the knowledge that I acquired was from coming into Hutch and talking about the setup and who would be good tank mates. They are very knowledgeable and run a nice family business. I don't know why but me and the girl I dated through college would come here all the damn time to look at the animals and marvel at our fellow creatures of the planet earth. If you are living in the Portage County area, Hutch Pet Shop is a fantastic place to go for your pet needs.
