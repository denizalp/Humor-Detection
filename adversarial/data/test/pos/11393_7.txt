China Star is in the process of becoming Ting's Kitchen. It is located in the strip mall at Mcintyre Center in McCandless.\n\nI arrived for lunch. Got seated right away since there were not a lot of people. I asked my waiter about the change. He told me they are still working on it and the full menu has not been completely changed out yet.\n\nThe first few pages of the menu is your typical Chinese American flare which you would find at almost any restaurant. The last couple of pages which has Chinese writing on the side is your Szechuan menu. If you want to know what is on the Taiwanese menu then you have to ask your waiter for those menu items.\n\nA lot of the Szechuan items I was told were authentic Chinese food and much of it is very spicy. i lot of those items were pork items but they had some items that were chicken, lamb, and even fish. I asked the waiter what kind of chicken they use for that preparation and I was told dark meat because it is \"tastier\" when preparing Szechuan foods. I was exploring the fish options and he recommended one which came with Tofu. Normally it comes very spicy but I can order it non-spicy if I so chose and would get a dinner portion for a dinner price. Note-there are some items on this menu which you can get a lunch portion on and save some money.\n\nI asked about what kind of fish it was and it was something I never heard of. I was debating whether or not I should order it bland but then I thought that it would be tasteless unless it has some flavor to it. So I decided to stick with the American side and ordered chicken breast with vegetables. Since it came as a lunch portion I ordered that. You have a choice of fried or white rice and one side which can either be a soup or spring roll. I opted for the spring roll.\n\nWhen I got the roll I found it a bit difficult to cut with my knife but it was otherwise okay. My main course arrived shortly afterwards and it was a smaller portion with  enough basic fried rice. It was good but very similar to what you would get at most other Chinese restaurants.\n\nI was given a bagged fortune cookie and wasn't offered a dessert as I had seen in other reviews. However, when I got my check it was written on it 5% discount if you pay in cash. I'll take a break like that anytime so I was able to get that discount once I told them I'd pay in cash. \n\nThis place is okay but I still prefer the one I ate at in Mt Lebanon earlier in the summer. It will be interesting to see what happens once they complete their renovations and put in the rest of the Taiwanese menu.  I was able to chat with some people at the next table who had ordered the Szechuan lamb dish and although the portion was generous I was told it was spicy hot! Please keep that in mind if you can't handle hot spicy foods.
