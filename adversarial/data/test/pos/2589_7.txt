Sometimes you need matching plaid shirts, a lobster trap or a vintage troll. On these fairly rare, yet very urgent, occasions, Public Butter is there for you. \n\nIt's only a few blocks from my house and a treasure trove of vintage clothes, fun extras and costume ideas. I'm here often. If you need a pick me up in Parkdale, look no further.
