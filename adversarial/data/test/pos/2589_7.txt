I feel like I've been lied to all my life. I used to think I knew what mint ice cream tasted like. It was my favorite. It was bright green. Ed's made me realize I was wrong. All of that was wrong. Turns out I'd never even had mint ice cream. Everyone was wrong. Everyone else making mint ice cream is wrong. They should just stop. \n\nEd's has a variety of different flavours that look really good, but why wouldn't you get the french mint? What's wrong with you!? Monster.
