Main thing is that it's open 24\/7. They make the sandwich pretty fresh, well the bread at least is warm and toasty once you bite into it. I like the Caribbean Jerk chicken the most. Some of the usual\/popular sammies I thought were just ok (ie. Montagu & Chicken Avocado). There's definitely a line out here after clubbing hours! So be prepared to wait like 20 mins sometimes.
