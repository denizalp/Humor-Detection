Came in a few days ago and asked for Bill K., my contact via the Costco auto buying program.  I was seated and told that Bill would meet me shortly.  After about ten minutes' waiting time, I met Charles Barrett, who told me that Bill K. had left the building, but that he would help me in his stead.  I will keep this very short by warning you to STAY AWAY from Earnhardt Honda!!  At the very least, if you are given Barrett as your salesperson (and his smarmy-looking associate- Caucasian male, 40s, brown hair- slicked back, mustache, white dress shirt, grey pants), do yourself a favor and turn around and run!  Barrett was not among the list of authorized contacts (as per Costco email) and should never have reached out to me.  He stated that an $897 charge was for added accessories (tinting, splash guards, and door edge film), when I knew that the tinting was standard in the model I was looking at, and that the other two items only amounted to $139 MSRP!!  Such audacity!!  To top the experience off, at the end of our meeting, I was not given anything in writing (which tipped me off to the insincerity of these two characters), AND Barrett never extended his hand to bid me thank you and good bye.  \n\nShady car salesmen such as Charles Barrett is only one of the many reasons I detest car-shopping.  I will definitely be telling everybody I know and meet to stay away from businesses such as Earnhardt Honda and the many examples of asshats like Charles Barrett employed there!
