Most people who consider Caesars to stay at already know about all the amenities and reasons why they would stay on middle of the strip.  This review is mainly to chronicle what a more plebeian stay booked through a deal site like Travelzoo will get you.  I'm not pretending to be naive and crying bait and switch, but those deals like Roman Tower stays starting at $90 usually means a midweek stay with a lousy view.  Never forget also that there are taxes and fees on top of this, including the big one:  the resort fee. We're not ballers or high-rollers, and we were staying 4 nights Fri through Tues so we had no leverage at all.  So what amounted to an offer that starts out sounding like it would be around $360 for the entire stay balloons to about $825 after said taxes and fees are included plus the fact that weekends are always more...\n\nWe stayed in the modest Roman Tower, one of the oldest.  Naturally they gave us an offer to upgrade before arriving:\n\nForum Tower (+20\/night);\nPalace Tower (+50);\nAugustus Tower (+70);\nOctavius Tower (+80);\n\nbut we didn't think we would use the rooms for much more than a place to sleep, clean up and get dressed;  besides we thought the savings would be better used towards a dinner at Guy Savoys or the QUA spa.  I may have considered it if we extended our stay longer and more midweek...\n\nThe room itself felt spacious and large http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-4?select=9wudUG4OF-JXt4LQomu7yQ#2R6vPFZ2vR3ZtGb4clCtrg.  It had dual sinks http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-4?select=9wudUG4OF-JXt4LQomu7yQ#LK9N_aE8VZljUA8j2p2RGQ with a separate tub http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-4?select=9wudUG4OF-JXt4LQomu7yQ#nuzRzn8VpqMWnLgqVHGMVA and shower http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-4?select=9wudUG4OF-JXt4LQomu7yQ#1ehbbM1g7bkm25TToQ89lA.  The bathroom amenities come from QUA spa so that was nice and also included a separate vanity and a small tv set over the sink though we hardly turned on the tvs during our stay.  It was easy to tell that the room is in one of the older towers since everything seemed a bit tired looking.  The whirlpool function didn't work in the tub either but we weren't expecting one in the first place.  We also had to endure some asshat frat boys who probably had 4 people in their room and were particularly loud nextdoor but we knew they were probably only staying Fri and Sat anyway...\n\nThe beds were modestly comfortable, the sheets were not crisp and new but they were clean.  We could have asked for a King bed but at the time I made the reservation, I didn't know if our son was going to join us...\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-4?select=9wudUG4OF-JXt4LQomu7yQ#0TtWKLPbxO_dkLCb4idd6w\n\nThere was a gap under the front door to the room that seemed abnormally large, big enough to stick your toes under if you wanted to which bothered the missus, but it seemed that all the doors (on our floor) were this way and there was an extra strip at the base on the outside to compensate and so we overlooked this too...\n\nSeems like we had to overlook a lot of things just so that we could stay here,  but in the end I felt it was worth it as we took in many of the restaurants downstairs without having to jump into our car, and we would schedule a large portion of one of our days in the spa on site.  Going to the parking lot is also a 15 minute one way trip, so keep that in mind too.  Sure I would have a \"Hangover\" like suite, but I'm sure you can have anything you want if you paid for it.  I also liked their fitness center which had mats for my yoga,  the pools outside were absolutely beautiful, and we enjoyed the close proximity of the forum shops...\n\n3 stars mostly for the room, but I would probably return...
