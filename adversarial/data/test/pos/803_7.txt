I like to come to this location really late at night because it gets super busy. Parking can really be a pain in the butt since I hate walking late in this area. If you come during peak hours you will have a hard time getting a machine or into a class. A lot of people from my high school come here and I hate that. I only care to go exercise and leave, not make conversation. I find it intimidating here in the weight\/machine area and barely end up using it because of that. The staff are really nice and very clean locker rooms. Also if you have children they have a child minding area.
