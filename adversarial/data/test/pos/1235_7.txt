Outstandingly amazing squash curry. Just really good. Perfect. 5 stars.\n\nSo why the 3? Well gather round, children.\n\nWhen the food came out we were starving. It didn't look quite like squash curry, but it could have been it, so we each had a bite. We quickly realized that it wasn't, and then waited for the server to come back to ask if we had the right dish. She came back, bringing us the correct dish and apologizing. OK, great. No harm, no foul.\n\nThen she proceeded to take the other dish and gave it to another table! We had just eaten out of it! Just beware and make sure you're food comes straight from the kitchen. Who knows how else they operate here if they're willing to do that.\n\nStill though, the squash curry was frakkin' delicious.
