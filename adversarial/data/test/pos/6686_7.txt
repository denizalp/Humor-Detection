Juliette et Chocolat...and I didn't even think about having any chocolate. I was here all for the crepes!! I was researching the menu while on the metro going to this place. Crepes crepes crepes!!! \n\nAnd of course, when you hype yourself up that much for something, you're bound to be a little let down. A group of friends and I came here for crepe lunch, which is quite a good value. About $20 for a savoury crepe, a dessert crepe, and then coffee or tea. It was a good catch-up session between the group...because the crepes took almost an hour to get to us. Lots of time to catch up. \n\nThe tea and coffee were great, served in real pitchers with loose leaf for the teas. Also ordered a cucumber basil lemonade which tasted like a grassy smoothie...hmm. At least it felt really healthy. \n\nThe crepes were...kinda meh. Correction, the savoury crepe, which was supposed to be the main attraction, was kinda meh. I got the Sunshine Crepe made with sundried tomatoes, fresh basil, bacon, cheese, and bechamel. The buckwheat crepe wasn't very smooth nor flavourful. The ingredients were kinda lackluster (limp greens, flimsy bacon, goopy bechamel). What saved it was the smoked salmon...which I had added for $4. \n\nOn the other hand, the dessert crepe was marvelous. The crepe itself was light and smooth, like what I'd expect a crepe to taste like. It was filled with either melted dark chocolate or caramel, with a light sprinkling of powder sugar. Very satisfying end to an otherwise meh meal.\n\nI mean, not a bad brunch deal. I rank it higher than an overpriced mediocre brunch place (like Cora's), but it's not going to be a favourite spot any time soon. Dessert crepes though? 100% will eat that instead of real lunch again. \n\n(61\/100) - 2018
