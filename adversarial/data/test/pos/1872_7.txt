Horrible service!!!! not even one customer in the branch, and the curly blond hair clerk wanted me to fill up deposit slip. Thats why Chase is paying you the 9$ per hour to fill up customers deposits slips ok. If you are too lazy to do it go try to work in a Fast food chain not in a bank lol.\nDefinitely would report that lazy S clerk to Chase Headquarters.
