Great country bar! \n\nI love the atmosphere , probably more than any other bar in Vegas. It's very authentic and tastefully decorated. \n\nUnfortunately, the food I've tried hasn't been great, but I'd rather come here to drink anyway. They have reasonable prices and a few good appetizer options to soak up the booze. Everyone that works here is super friendly. \n\nI wish they played more country music, and I wish they had a mechanical bull! \n\nI will return many, many times!\n\nps.\n\nThe jalapeno poppers made me cry my eyes out.
