I came here after looking for really close restaurants.  This place is literally only a couple of miles away from me, very close to another good Asian restaurant, Dong Ting Spring.  I'm not a Thai food expert but I've eaten at Lotus of Siam a lot.\n\nI went around 3 PM on a weekday.  The place is quite small and would, rather uncomfortably, seat 30.  Despite what I would imagine is a down-time, there were about 10 people there.  Two servers were very attentive to the customers there.  The place seems a bit strange with some worn down oddly styled chairs and strange multicolored plastic tumblers.\n\nThe menu seemed to contain a lot of the standard Asian food fare with a focus on Thai dishes.  I got chicken panang and asked for it as hot as possible (hotter than a 10).  I ended up with about a 9 on the Lotus of Siam scale, which to me is enough to make my mouth tingle, but unfortunately no sweat, tears, or sniffling.  The amount of food was fine and on par with what you get at Lotus, and the taste was good, but the quality of the chicken used was definitely inferior.  I ran into a piece of gristle and overall the chicken had a much \"floppier\" mouthfeel than what you would recognize as a good piece of chicken.  Even further down the scale, for example, would be the curry from the Red Shrimp Company, if you've had that.\n\nSoda is canned, which is a bit of a minus, but the prices on everything are very reasonable.  For the chicken panang, a soda, and another dish (fried chicken & fried rice) to go, it was only $16.  A bit of a warning here, you can only use a credit or debit card if your order is more than $15.
