Oddly, Stevey and I went to the same party and had very different views.\n\nHomme's drinks are cheap when they're on special. The bartender really pissed me off by charging me $1 for a vodka drink at 10:45 p.m. and charging me $4 for the same drink at 11:02 p.m. \n\nIt's not my fault you're slow, and I just tipped you $2 for the previous drink. Would it kill you to cut me some slack?\n\nFrench Kiss is a pretty weak party. It doesn't come close to Faux Show at Glam, its direct competitor.\n\nAlso, Stevey noted the diversity at Homme. I call it a lack of identity. The bar lacks a distinct character, and the crowd reflected it. It was too hetero to be gay, too mainstream to be edgy and too unattractive to be fashionable.\n\nI doubt I'll hit Homme again unless its for a goth\/industrial night.
