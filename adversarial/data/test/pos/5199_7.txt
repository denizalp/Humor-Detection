The restaurant is easy to miss and nondescript but what lies inside is a remarkable dining experience that awaits you.\nWe were impressed the moment we stepped inside. The host was warm, congenial, and incredibly professional. He made us feel welcome, offered us some choice seats, and had us comfortably seated in moments. The wait staff was superb and congenial as well. \n\nThe food was EXQUISITE. The dishes were creative and incredibly delicious. Everything was artfully plated. The plates were a perfect portion unlike the indulgent serving of other places we went to in Montreal. My husband and I had 4 plates of food and for the first time in our trip we were able to eat everything.\n-Duck Tartare 18\nWith foie gras shavings, coffee, dates, jerusalem artichoke, trevisio, kamut, and hazelnuts.\nThis was absolutely divine. The entire dish melts in your mouth. Hazlenus with duck and foie gras is a revelation and one of the best things I have tasted.\n\n-Mackerel 18\nWith crisp fried sweetbreads, white asparagus, dashi butter, plum, samphire. Simultaneously light and rich. This is beautiful to the eyes and taste buds. \n\n-Venison 34\nWith r√∂sti, cabbage, labneh, juniper, honeyberries, yellow foot chanterelles.\nHearty, flavorful, and oh so satisfying.\n\n-Cornish hen 30\nWith liver, fava beans, morels, bacon, fiddleheads, apple, mustard. \nI gave my husband shit for ordering chicken but it was perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, and seasoned beautifully. All the ingredients just worked. \nThere's a great wine selection  but we were happy with our beers. The pils cauwe (pronounced cow) and brune reserve was great.\nWe wanted to do the 8 course tasting menu but decided against it. We were informed that it would take about 3 hrs or 4 hrs, something like that to complete. We had a long day and a eventful itinerary for the next day so just ordered a lot of food. If you want to try the tasting menu set aside time for it. Everyone in your table must participate. \nWe had a great time. I would come back.
