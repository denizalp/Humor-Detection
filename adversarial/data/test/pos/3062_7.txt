This is a restaurant that you go to for the authentic Thai experience rather than simply to fill up your stomach till it hurts.\n\nSurprisingly their prices are reasonable and many of their lunch combos are under $10. Portions are small through. The soup bowl is so tiny I thought it was dipping sauce for the spring roll. I assume it's their culture.\n\nWonderful service. Clean, spacey restaurant with extra fancy decor. You should totally take a girl out here and show her how cultured you are.
