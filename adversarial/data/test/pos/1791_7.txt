Setting up an appointment for someone to come out to me was super fast and easy. I had a small pit in my window and I wanted it fixed immediately. \n\nI was given a 12-4 time block for them to come out and was told I would receive a call when they were on their way. 4 came and no one had called me yet, so I called the office and she took care of it immediately calling the person that was supposed to be here. I was a little disappointed that no one showed up in the time window but I am happy with how well they handled it. He ended up showing up about 15 minutes later. He came and fixed it super fast though. Seriously, it only took 5 minutes. The repair looks great and he cleaned my front windshield inside and out before he left. \n\nI bought the Yelp deal, so it was even cheaper than the original cheap quote I received. \n\nI'm happy.
