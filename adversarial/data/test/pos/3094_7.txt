We have been to SW many times.... I recommend SW to everyone I know going to Vegas for their great food, interesting atmosphere and \"the frog\" or \"balls\" or \"lips\". \n\nOn this occasion, however, our experience was instantly tainted by a real stronzo (use google translate to Italian, if you'd like to know what that means) by the name of Fabrice. \n\nFabrice greeted us... or better, looked us up and down. Me in my Louboutin's, Nicole Miller gown and my husband in his Gucci shoes and Burberry suit... and apparently he was displeased. We had just gotten to Vegas, I had made our reservations months in advance and we smiled, said hello and told him of our reservation. \n\nHe said, \"Patio\" and I corrected him saying we'd made a reservation on the glass, on the patio. He intently stared and me, I stared right back and he said that it was 7:30pm on a Wednesday in Las Vegas and there was no glass seats on the patio available. I asked how long we'd need to wait and he said that there wouldn't be one available this evening. \n\nI was not a happy girl. This was, up until now, our favorite restaurant in Vegas. We have been a dozen times, we have had friends go because we've suggested it and we always spend a pretty penny. Being So Cal folks, we love their foie gras, a delicacy we can no longer enjoy in the golden state! \n\nA kind hostess, said she had a great table, wonderful view of the \"show\" and it was 1\/2 inside and 1\/2 outside... I looked at my husband, who really wanted some Foie Gras and we decided to stay. Despite my better judgement... there are a lot of fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas. \n\nUpon being seated, something because strikingly obvious... there was not one, but two seats for two, right on the glass. \n\nWHAT A STRONZO! We were furious...... \n\nClearly this seems like an overreaction, but when you are accustomed to great service, at this restaurant (and other), this was just an obvious \"he doesn't like us\" \"we don't belong here\" kind of thing and that makes me mad. \n\nI hate being discrimnated against and there was clearly a case of that going on. \n\nAs usual, the Foie Gras appetizer was fabulous, the ribeye topped with seared foie gras was \ngood (not great, the ribeye) our wine from James the Sommelier (Relic Cabernet) was perfect and our after dinner port was delightful. \n\nMike and Corey, our servers were fantastic, attentive and kind... but it's hard to put a better taste in our mouth after Fabrice. \n\nI doubt we will go back to SW, having dined and spent nearly double at CUT the next night... with EXCEPTIONAL service and flawless food... I think we found a new favorite and a new place to recommend (at our favorite hotel too, Palazzo, where we stay). \n\nAll in all, I'm disappointed. We really liked SW... it was special to us. Perhaps one day we'll go back... but if it's Fabrice who's greeting us.... I will walk right back out.
