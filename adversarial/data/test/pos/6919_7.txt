This wasn't for me.  I didn't like not being on the strip or downtown.  It's like visiting a casino resort anywhere, so I just didn't get that Vegas feel that I love.  The hotel was nice enough, but I just never felt any real satisfaction.\n\nWe had a suite, but there aren't any balconies so that was disappointing for me.  People were very casually dressed which stunk.  I can dress casually at home anytime.  The bathroom was large but awkward because there wasn't a separate toilet room so it was just really put in the open.  \n\nThe pool was super crowded and without enough umbrellas, it was blistering hot and I could only stand it about a half hour which stinks because I LOVE laying out.  I tried going in the early morning and that was better, but not my desired time.  \n\nI did like the very convenient Starbucks!  Overall, it was okay, but that's all.
