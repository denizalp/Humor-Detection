My first time at this location. It was large and spacious. I order the spicy fish soup. Flavorful, somewhat spicy but I ended up adding more spice to my liking. I also ordered the fried tofu in which I was not a fan. It wasn't firm tofu so it made it difficult to eat due to lack of flavor and the texture. The service was fair. I may consider them in the future if my usual spot is too crowded or not open.
