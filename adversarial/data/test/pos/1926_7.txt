I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just the tiniest bit apprehensive the first time I came here, especially because it was my first (and so far only time) bouldering. It didn't help that I knew a friend of mine had sprained her toe here when she fell off a wall. My concerns dissipated pretty quickly, however. Before they let you run free and wild here, you have to go through a mini tour\/orientation\/lesson\/test thing, where they basically explain some key ground rules and most importantly, teach you how to properly fall. They actually make you practice falling a bit, which is kind of awkward and makes you kind of feel stupid while you're like purposely falling off the wall and rolling onto your back, but you know what, for me it eased my apprehensions.\n\nSince you're not harnessed in, for the most part the bouldering walls are not that high, with the exception of the dragon. There's a big foam pit under that one though, so falling in (as I did several times) is not that scary beyond the initial time.\n\nI don't have anything else to compare it to, but the walls at the Hub are doable (I would say for any fitness level), but still challenging, and definitely a lot of fun. For a first time boulderer, I was comfortable with V0 walls, but struggled a bit with V1. I heard that they change up the placement of the hand\/foot grips from time to time, which is awesome because you can come again and again and have a totally novel experience and never get bored.\n\nIt's one of the pricier fitness activities I've tried - I think I paid around $30 for my first visit, which included a day pass, shoe rental, and one time fall assessment fee. You get a discount if you're a full-time student, teacher, police, fire, ambulance, or military personnel (none of which I am.) I went on a Tuesday night, and it was decently busy (I assume most people there were regulars, they stayed around the more advanced walls), but at least the easier walls were pretty empty for the most part. What I like about the environment is that everyone there is super respectful and nice, people will wait their turn if you're on a wall that they want, no one hogs the walls, people are not pushy, and no one is judgy or rude. I had a really good time here overall and stayed for about two hours, after which point my arms felt like they were going to fall off. I will say it was definitely an incredible workout though - the next morning I could barely move because my entire body hurt. If it wasn't so far for me, I'd come more often, but I definitely want to come again!
