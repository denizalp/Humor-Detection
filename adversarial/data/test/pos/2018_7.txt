We came here for breakfast. We were not greeted for a few minutes. There was one family sitting. A lady finally came out from the back to seat us. She seemed very stressed for not really having anyone in the restuarant. \n\nShe didn't take our drink order for about 10 minutes after sitting down. She took our food order at the same time. \nI noticed another couple walking in and standing there forever as well. They ended up just seating themselves. \n\nWe had: The Grandma Meat (really gross name)\nAnd the Eggs and Cakes - the pancakes were okay. I had to ask for syrup. And the eggs were cookes as I asked. \n\nThey were both decent. There wasn't anything to set them apart from Ihop or Denny's. (Your typical cheap breakfast joints.) That is the best thing about this place--it's cheap. \n\nOverall, it didn't do much for me. It's not high quality food and the wait times are kind of long when they have no one there. The waitress didn't seem to keen on serving people in general.
