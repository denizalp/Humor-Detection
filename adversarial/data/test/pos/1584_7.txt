5 stars because I've shared time with someone special here many times.  This is our favorite place to play basketball, not the main court where it's always crowded and people take the game too seriously but at the back hidden court near the dog park.  It's never packed pass 8pm and we usually have the court to ourselves.  This is where I like to play ball with a small group of friends or 1 on 1.\n\nMy Church also planned a softball tournament here which turned out to be a success. We had the whole baseball field for the tournament without having to make some type of reservation. It was on a Saturday morning which was more of a surprise or maybe no one really plays softball here.\n\nIf you have a dog, great place to meet other dog lovers since there is a dog park here too. Be careful where you step at though, there's rumors of sleeping brown smurfs laying all around.\n\nI've never seen anything rowdy here happen and no suspicious people loitering around. I can say this place is pretty safe from what I've experienced and seen around.
