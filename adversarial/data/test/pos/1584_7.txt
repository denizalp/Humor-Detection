First of all, this place is a BYOW. They have some pretty decent italian meals. Last time i got the bruschetta which was one of my favourites in a while. Next i got the arancini which were OK. As a main meal i shared a pizza, it was a thin crust style pizza and it was pretty good.  Overall, i enjoy coming here, it's not too overpriced, you can bring your wine, and the staff is always friendly.
