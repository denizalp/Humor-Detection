The West Side Market reminds me of my childhood! Going to the market with my dad and picking out fresh, wholesome food from friendly, welcoming vendors is a treat! The place is full of options for fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and sweets... and for fair prices! I recommend getting a crepe before you shop and heading upstairs to eat it while you pick out what shops you want to stop at to buy groceries for the week.\n\nNow that I live downtown, I plan on shopping there frequently and supporting the local vendors!
