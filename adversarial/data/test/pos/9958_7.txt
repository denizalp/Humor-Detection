Tell me why this place is less than 4 stars. WTF? \n\nIn the words of our President, \"This is SAD. No wonder why D.C. isn't working.\" \n\nTo give this place less than 5 stars is honestly stupid AF. What else do you expect from an AZN buffet? There a lot of food, good choices and it looks like a mothafckin Elks Lodge in here. \n\nFor all this haters out there, BE GONE!!!!\n\nThis is place is FIERRRRRR.
