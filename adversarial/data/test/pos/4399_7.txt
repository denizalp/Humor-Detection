Horrible. The wait is terrible. 2 hour wait. And the rooms are not filled in the back. The manager of this place is loud and obnoxious.  She wears flip flops and short shorts and tells people. That's not my job. And we all had to hear her sushi order. \n\nNot sure who we saw as we were not given a name but I'm sure it wasn't a doctor. He gives us the diagnosis and looks at me for approval like mom did I do good?  \n\nUgh never again
