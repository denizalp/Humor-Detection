Holy moly! Come hungry...and with a lot of money. Ha! It's expensive, but SO WORTH IT. Charlotte needed a cool establishment like this. Especially for an Asian aficionado like myself, I am always on a lookout for cool Asian food that is perfectly prepared and artistically presented. Think Asian tapas, and remember that they will be small portions. The server recommended that we each order 3 or 4 plates. The plates range from about 10-30. See what I mean about expensive? But one taste of the pork belly, and you'll be emptying your wallet on the table and summoning the waiter for more! Arigato!
