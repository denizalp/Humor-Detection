Visited with family and friends. EXCELLENT  service and a beautiful dining experience overlooking the golf course water features. Weather was perfect last night to be on their patio dining room.  I enjoyed my crabcake appetizer. It's complimentary with two entree purchase and a Yelp check in. Awesome :) My son tried their grilled cheese, but he didn't really like it. I think it was missing butter on the bread as it was grilling. I saw several items from the menu as it was served and the French Dip and Pasta seemed like favorites. The fish and chips was a bit greasy I overheard. We had one friend who has food allergies and our server and chef were SO accomodating and helped create a dish she really enjoyed safely. Overall, a pleasant dinner because of the staff care and company, and a perfect place to bring out-of-town guests.
