The first few times I liked the food but the last two times I ate here, the food wasn't that great and additionally I didn't feel too good after eating here. I think the burgers are good, but the noodle dishes weren't that impressive. Even then, there are better veggie burgers in town. It's definitely a great idea,  the service is fast and friendly, place is spacious and clean but I think some work is needed on the food items. One thing I would come back for is the shakes, they are definitely worth a trip and their lemonades are pretty good. \n\nGet the burger, lemonade and their ice cream shake as dessert, avoid other items.
