Went on Sunday 5-31-15 around 2 PM.  You can walk around outside and into the right side of the main building for free.  This area contains a gift shop and about 20 machines\/items that the shop has restored. There are a few cool cars and old coke machines outside. Everybody is all stuck on that stupid pawn shop show but I like Rick's Restorations way better.  \nI really wanted to take the tour but they only offer it Monday-Friday 8-3:30PM or something like that, and I work during those hours :( I guess I'll never get to go on the tour! The tour is $5 or you can buy a t-shirt and they'll throw in two passes for free.  Also military and vets are free with ID card!! \nThe items inside are roped off with chains and while I was there some jackass customer went behind the chain and started messing with one of the old machines and Rick's daughter, Ally, came right over and yelled at him \"I CAN'T HAVE YOU TOUCHING THE ITEMS BEHIND THE CHAIN...THAT'S WHY THE CHAIN IS THERE!!\" And the guy was tryin' to be a real smartass and said \"Oh, is that why that chain is there? Oops...sorry\".  LOL you get him, Ally!!!!
