Tried this for the first time on Tuesday, so we went to the restaurant and wanted to look at the menu to get food to go.  A stout little lady popped out of the back kitchen and completely rushed us.  Had no suggestions and was rude.  We know what we want but we had heard that this place was a little pricey.  \nWe ordered Pad Kee Mao, Basil Chicken, and Satay and it was nearly $40!!!! WTF! So we thought \"oh this better be good\".  Got home and took out food out of the bag and again said WTF!  WTF is this sh**?!  I have worked in a Thai restaurant and this is not authentic Thai food, WHAT-SO-EVER!  My basil chicken was ground chicken I am guessing - looked like hamburger but tasted like a turd.  I could've whipped up something better in my home - WITH REAL CHICKEN.  How CHEAP of them to use ground chicken and charge so much.  My bf's Pad Kee Mao looked like ramen noodles, and was not made with the wide, thick rice noodles and surely didn't taste like any Pad Kee Mao he had ever tasted, and he's Thai!  \n\nDon't waste your time or money to go here.  It is nothing but a rip off.  I can not believe they have been in business this long.  Should have drove across town to get Golden Wok.  Would have been have the price, authentic and tastes delicious!
