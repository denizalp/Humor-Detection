Life is about phases.  Sometimes I am an oak and other times I am an undisciplined pig.  The latter gives cause to resent myself.  Further resentment makes me want to punish myself even more.  Punish myself in the form of fats, sugars, simpler carbs, and shitty attitudes.  It's been a bad third quarter for 2016.  But....I digress.\n\nBack in the day-day, I used to live in this neck of the woods.  I love JitB.  It has at times been an abusive relationship with many a forgiveness until I can't catch my breath at the top of the stairs.  This particular location has caused me many a pleasure and pain.  Then I moved away to another part of town, only to be abused by another JitB location.\n\nIt's been three years (approx) since my return to the NW.  It was only until very recently, I returned to this address to see what would happen.\n\nArriving shortly before what I assume was the lunch rush, I placed my order for a funky JitB burger I had seen on TV (Classic Buttery Jack).  Additionally, I ordered up some curly fries and pop.  The service was so-so, but the food severed as a gastro main line straight into my soul.  I could have cried. I could have laughed.  Perhaps, it was a mixture of the above stated, pleasure & pain.  The food was just as I has remembered it.  Damn you Jack, I love you...I hate you.
