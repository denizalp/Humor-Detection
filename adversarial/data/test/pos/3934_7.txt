I came here for lunch\/brunch on a sunny Sunday. This place is edgy and beautiful. The rooftop terasse reminds me of Chicago ! We were a big group without reservations and we got sitted pretty quickly. The staff is very helpful and nice\nI had an amazing plate of funghi pasta. The truffle wasn't too overpowering. \nMy friends had the frittata and they really enjoyed it. \nI had a piece of a spinach pizza, it was divine. \nFor desert, we shared buckwheat pancakes. \nThe letdown for me was the banana bread, I felt it lacked moisture.
