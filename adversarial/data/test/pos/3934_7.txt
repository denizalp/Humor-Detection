For the old world, exotic, far Eastern Asia vibe that takes you on the top of a Vegas resort hotel that glistens in golden yellow? Take yourself up 64 floors up Mandalay Bay! But not quite a place for everyone, for this is an exclusive club requiring club membership: The Foundation Room. Although you may get a chance to step foot in this through an event, pay cover charge, or VIP access, or via a Host, or a private party. (Recently held my birthday party in this venue!) With warm red furnishings' colors and purple-bluish lighting, plush furniture, a \"roaring\" fireplace in the main lounge overlooking the bar, an inspiring 1856 decor, 18th century paintings, walls adorned with buddhas, all cozy to take you to a faraway land. A large wooden chair by the elevators will accommodate at least three people, somehow made me feel like a Princess sitting on it. At least my friend thinks I look like a Princess he remarked after the photo. DJ music plays to get your dance groove on. Cocktails in the bar are quite reasonably affordable. The bartender and servers were attentive. Dining menu includes steak, vegetarian, and Asian, Indian,  Mediterranean flair served in white linen, white tableware, crystal stemware, and gleaming silverware. VIP host was accommodating and helpful in making my birthday party a memorable one. There are seven exclusive VIP chambers to hold your private party. Such rooms have the decors of Buddhas, stately Gothic style, Ganesh Prayer Rooms, and an 1856 style room. And best of all, there is the romantic feeling this club exudes. (It would be real nice with my love-y!) To top it all, extend that feeling stepping out onto the breathtaking spectacular view from the patio eye-ing the Las Vegas \"Strip\" as far as your eyes can see and see planes through your own \"bird's eye\" view of the McCarran International Airport. Hey, the plane, the plane! ...oh, planes! It's not the best view (it's the second best view as seen in the South part of Vegas) but Oh, but when the wind blows my hair in the way I like feeling it, it's just fine .. Feel like on top of the world! You, too.
