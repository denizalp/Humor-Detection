I am disappointed with the line-up of DJ's in this beautiful club. When I was here years ago there was much better talent. When I went to XS last the extremely religious DJ Kaskade was playing AGAIN, which personally took away from the authenticity of the night club world. I love music and love being around people that also love and appreciate music, but since there is better talent at the other clubs in Las Vegas, I sadly will not be coming to XS again unless they make some serious changes. \n\nIt also seems like if you are related to people that work here that you get better treatment. I think there should be some kind of limit to that.
