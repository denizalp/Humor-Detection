Out of my desperation for needing a seafood fix in Tempe one night, the boyfriend and I went to King's. It was a brand I was familiar with so I thought it would be good...the result? Very over-priced, over-cooked, bland seafood. Fish and chips were not nearly as good as George and Dragon, the shrimp was rubbery, and the clam chowder tasted like it was from a can. The only good thing about the meal was the complimentary sourdough bread and the servers were very nice and friendly. Not impressed.
