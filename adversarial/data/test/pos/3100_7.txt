I am not a clean freak. Though, I am a clean enthusiast. If you're looking for a quick, thorough wash-down on your automobile, this location will take care of you. The machine does a great job and I haven't noticed any dings or scratches from the brushes. \n\nWhen I first came here, they offered me the monthly package. I really like the idea, but just couldn't bring myself to sign up for another reoccurring monthly payment. If you're an Uber or Lyft driver, I highly recommend that deal. It's probably tax deductible. I usually order the $5 wash. There is also a $3 option. \n\nThe reason for 3 stars is not personal. I really like the way my car looks after I come here, and the free vacuum stations is a great addition. There's just nothing particularly special that brings me back, other than it's right by my house.
