So I found this place originally by seaching Las Vegas Spa on Groupon.  Whenever traveling I always try to live like the locals a little, Groupon has made it a good way to plan in advance and save money.  After finding \"The Foot Spa\" on Groupon, I look it up on yelp to find a bunch of great reviews plus a YELP DEAL that was a much better deal than Groupon (The Foot Spa seems a little flexible with their prices) \n\n$28 for a 30 minute detox soak followed by 60 minutes \"foot massage\" \n \n\nYes, I'll take it! \n\nThe Foot Spa by no means is unique in its business.   It is located about 3 miles west of the strip on Spring Mountain Road and Decatur. I have never been to Chinatown in Vegas prior to this, however the number of Foot Spas there are in this area reminds me of some twlight zone shit.  Some are open 24 hours....  I am not sure if Chinatown just loves reflexology or if I'm being naive and some of the foot spas are... nevermind\n\nI had called and made an appointment and locked in our price with the Yelp deal (but I don't think you need a Groupon or Yelp to make a deal with them)   A few customers came in and had already agreed on a price with the Foot Spa from calling and making an appointment.  I think 30 dollars for a 60 minute massage is around standard price.  \n\nMy detox foot soak was very nice. My three girlfriends and myself were able to sit 4-in-a-row, sip on tea, and watch tv (yes, I requested to change the channel - they don't mind)  I am not sure if I totally believe in the detox soak or at least I'm not sold on it yet.  The color of my water was deep orange.  Supposely the toxins were coming out of my joints.  \n\nOnce my 30 minute soak was complete, I was scheduled to get a 60 minute foot massage.  I thought a 60 minute foot massage sounded like a long time to have someone rub your feet.  Well, \"foot massage\" was actually a full body massage.  I am not sure why they call it a foot massage.  You leave your clothes on beause you're not in a private room.  It's kinda like a chair massage you see in malls.  Don't let anything I'm saying fool you though, this was the best masssage I've ever had.  Just prepare yourself, this isn't a 5 star spa -- it is nice, quiant, and clean place and gives dank massages...  And let me remind you of the price, $28 for a 30 minutes soak and 60 minute full body massage (The Encore is $160 for a 45 minute massage that wasn't half as good - much prettier aesthetically though) \n\nNonetheless - 5 stars!\n\nYou just have to be ready for a $10 cab ride or a 3 mile walk and some authentic Chinese Vegas Culture.  I could see why someone might be annoyed for truckin' out here -- but I still recommend doing it.\n\nIf you're a travel bargain hunter\/shopper like me, I also recommend the outmall mall that's off the strip -- It's the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North, it never disappoints.
