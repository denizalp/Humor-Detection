Place is STILL a dump.  Cans of crappy beer are almost as expensive as HOB.  Do lines in your car...the toilets here look like Trainspotting.  Now, for some reason you cant use that back parking lot but CONVENIENTLY you can use their pay lot up front for 10 bux.  F that, park a block West (street parking) and save yourself the cash.  Only come here if you absolutely have too...or at least if Ray Parker Jr. decides to sing again.
