Get off of my fork\nGet into my mouth\nGet off of that grill\nGet into some sauce (BBQ)\nGet into my belly\nyum yum, yeah\n\nGet outta my mind\nGet into my life\nOooooooooh\nOh I said hey (Hey) you (You)\nGet into my belly\n(Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Get Into My Car)\n\nPork on a Fork was showcased on Drive-In, Dives, and Diners with Guy Fieri not too long ago.  From there they've became a hit and won numerous awards, plus rave reviews both on Yelp and from Foodies around the valley.  Needless to say, this place is pretty darn good wouldn't you say!  \n\nMy office is close by so whenever I get a chance I try to hit the Fork.  Their Pulled Pork Sandwich is what I would consider the quintessential pulled pork meal. With sides of fingerling potatoes and coleslaw.  Good'o boys meal I guess, but man the pork and soft and tender; add some spicy bbq and finger licking good -- YUMMY!  Portions here are modest I think so you won't over eat in my opinion.  \n\nThe place itself started in modest fashion.  When I first came there was maybe 6 tables max, but now they have an entire huge patio in the back.  Let's just after having a meal here you'll need more room - wink!  Again, this place is a dive so take the boys out and leave the dating scene out! - Enjoy!
