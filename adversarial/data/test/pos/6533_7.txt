The Fong family is doing great things as far as spreading the aloha all over what many now call the \"9th Island\" with their delicious Hawaiian food. There are two sides: sushi side and grill side, but it doesn't really matter because you can order from both menus either way. I love coming here for 50% off rolls Monday-Wednesday. Just don't forget to tip on the regular price! Service is great, but not perfect. Out of the 20+ times I've been in only a couple \"off\" days had happened. I recommend their garlic chicken on this side of town, poke avocado bowl, pau hana roll, kahuku roll, negihama roll, and big island roll. I have never had bad sushi here...ever! It gets even better, they have dessert! Yummy malasadas with various fillings, whole and individual cake slices (guava, haupia, dobash, and chantilly). Also, seasonal offerings such as pumpkin mochi! The new renovation looks great!
