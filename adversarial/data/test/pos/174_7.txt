I have enjoyed this place 3 times now, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon! I kept seeing this mentioned on yelp so finally when my long time go-to spa closed, I decided to give it a try. I can't say that I don't still enjoy having a service at a high end spa, but I can say that I can get 5 service here for the price of that 1! The masseuses here are no joke when it comes to pressure, but are quick to ask you if you're okay with it. The semiprivate rooms don't bother me at all, since all of your clothes remain on. I've had three different  For Christmas they had a special $34 for 90 minutes!!! Talk about a steal! This place never disappoints!!
