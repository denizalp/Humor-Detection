I just bought a foreclosed home and needed to get new carpet before I moved in. Mitch - who is the owner - helped me find the carpet I needed and was able to have it installed right after my house closed. The installers did a GREAT job, and I am completely satisfied with the communication Mitch provided and the selection he had in flooring. He also has a wide variety of fans (duh, see the name), lighting and home accessories.
