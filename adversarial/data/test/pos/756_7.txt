Given the restaurant is by the snooty ass Gordon Ramsey, I expected more.  However, I only intended to drink to occupy myself while my out-of-town were gambling.  Somewhat disappoint that the sparkling wine listed on the menu was not the one they were pouring...it was Chateau Ste. Michele, which is a good value but only about $8.00 at CVS and naturally it was $8.00 a glass here.  However, the bartender was cool and topped me off a few times free of charge, but I did order 3 glasses...I would have been smarter buying the bottle from the beginning.  Like I said I don't gamble, and expected my guest to turn up definitely by the time I was on drink #2...sadly they showed up when I completed glass #3 and was about to order #4...however, thankfully, husband intervened and comforted me that we have several bottle of this in our \"everyday\" wine stock.  So I stopped and like the intelligent person I am said let's order FOOD! to complete the evaluation of this place. I was only thinking of my fellow yelpers, YKWIM?\n\nSo all 4 of us shared sliders and fish and chips.  All of it was Ok, but given that Ramsey is such a hardass, I expected more so much more!  The food did not deliver, but still it was decent.  Fresh, but just ordinary.\n\nif I come back, it is only to sit at the bar and have drinks.\n \nPS.  Whoever won Hell's kitchen needs atleast a few more lessons.  Also the outfits of the wait staff are hideous.
