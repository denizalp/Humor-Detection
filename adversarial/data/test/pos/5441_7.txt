I am going to start by saying I cannot believe all the good rating this company has. Because, my experience with them was horrible.\nThe thing that really angered me and it still does is that he had the nerve to put one of his stickers on my water heater. \nHe never asked to do it, I did not have him do any work , and he defaced my Water Heater.\n I was selling my house and the buyers Real Estate person had this Company come out. He fully misdiagnosed for Termites which when I had another company (2 Actually) they both said it was old damage and it was bits of wood used in the landscaping.\nHe took photos of pieces of wood in the yard and said there was termite damage, nothing in the house or touching the house.\nAnyway, He had written up an estimate that was way over the top as well.\nBut, again what really angered me was the Sticker that he put on my water heater in my laundry room.\nPlus his bill was far too padded.
