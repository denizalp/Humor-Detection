So...here's the thing.  This is not a place you come for dinner.  This is a place where you come to cheat on dinner.\n\nI have had this place bookmarked for a rather long time and have finally had a chance to visit.  I am a hot dog fanatic and am always in search of a good frankfurter.  I have noticed this place hasn't gotten much love in terms of reviews, and some of them aren't the most favorable, but I still had to visit.\n\nWalking up to the place you may hesitate a bit.  This place is not glamorous in the least.  In fact it looks run down both outside an in.  To me, that gives this place some legitimacy.  If you can serve a mean hot dog (and sandwiches) and have a steady flow of customers, who cares what this place looks like.  It kind of reminds you of a dive bar, but with some of the best food around.\n\nWhen you enter you are greeted by the counter where you can order your food\/drink.  There is a small menu written in chalk above.  It's not a huge menu, but if you are coming here you kind of already know what you are going to order.  Thing to note, CASH ONLY.  Don't show up with a big order and think I'll put it on a card, have your wad of cash ready.  Once you order you can then move yourself to the seating area.  Worn in tables surrounded by chairs that are haphazardly placed in this space.  There is also a bar area where you can enjoy your meal.  \n\nI don't know why, but I lulled for a bit.  I stared at the menu even though I already knew what I wanted.  I let the person that came in after me order his food so I could scope out how the ordering process goes.  Didn't want to place the fool here.  Finally, time to order was here, if not I would have to wait until the pack of construction workers came in.  I stepped up and without hesitation order myself a foot long with chili and cheese and of course a water to wash it down.  \n\nJust so we all know, eating a foot long hot dog with chili and cheese is not the easiest, nor cleanest thing to accomplish.  So I sat my dignity aside and dove into this monster.  Just enough toppings that it didn't mask the hot dog itself.  This foot long had a bit of a char to it even though it was made on a flatiron.  Like it was sitting there, waiting for me to order it.  That salty crispness of the casing followed by the juiciness of the innards, yum.  Then add the slight spice of the chili and cheese and it was magnificent.  I had a tear in my eye.  I thought that was a sign until I noticed to my right that they were in the process of cutting up onions and the aroma was in the air.  \n\nWill I be cheating on dinner again?  Of course, this place is more for snacking than a meal, but it was oh so satisfying.
