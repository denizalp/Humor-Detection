Hello Friends, \n\nWell, if you \"know\" me and check out my profile you will see out of over 130 reviews only 9 are ONE STAR (Eek! Methinks not). Well now its 10. For good reasons. \n\nI do not base my reviews off previous reviews of a company. \nI give a lot of places at least 2 or 3 chances to redeem themselves.\nI love food and try to find the silver lining in all experiences (good & bad)\n\nWell well well..... This place WILL NOT get a second chance.   jankie establishment the flyer\/promotion (that they left on my door) spelled the place \"CHeeRY HOUSE\". Really?? and I notice on Yelp and the building its CHERRY HOUSE II... Not \"ChEEry House\".  Lazy owners that don't care enough to get the name of the place right..smh Well, they do offer %10 off on delivery and %15 off pick up over a certain amount. (sorry, i didn't commit to memory since i WONT be back)\nI know how some are about \"strip mall\" and this is located inside one.. ekk ekk ekk\n\nNow to the \"food\"... Not bad in prices, buttttttt..... you get what you pay for. \n \nMy GF had Lemon Chicken (breaded tiny piece of \"chicken\" With a lot of breading to trick you into thinking you got a lot of food) with Crab rangoon (Wasn't bad 3.5\/5), & \"brown rice\"\n\ni ordered Shrimp\/Chicken & Brocclli & \"Brown rice\" as in white rice with brown sauce on it (and I can tell due to the large lump of white rice in the middle), an Egg Roll that didn't make it to the bag as i guess they forgot even tho it comes in the combo) .\nI had, and please believe me.. i counted.. 5 shrimp in my whole order. And it wasn't the big shrimp, it was the 20-30 count. The \"spring roll\" was as long as Your middle finger and as wide as 2 fingers. I have a finger for them alright... ah ah ahhhh.. not that finger but my thumb. Pointing at me as to say... I won't be back!
