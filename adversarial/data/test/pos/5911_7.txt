I had an energy-sucking, dinosaur fridge that I replaced several months ago. The dinosaur was hanging out in my garage, and not knowing how to get it removed, I randomly contacted SRP; they scheduled a time to pick it up at no charge. The best part, they pay you $30!\n\nAWESOME! \nFantastic program!\nWonderful customer service!\n\nThey recycle these dinosaurs...HOORAY for our ENVIRONMENT!\n\nI highly recommend that you contact them, if you have are in the same situation. For your convenience, I have included the website\/contact info below:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.srpnet.com\/energy\/powerwise\/savewithsrp\/appliancerecycling.aspx \n\nilike
