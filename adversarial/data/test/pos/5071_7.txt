I can't believe I'm the first one to review this Brampton classic. I've been going to Bombay Palace rarely for the past 10 years or so for parties and dinners, and almost as a rule I've always been pleased with the spread. \n\nDuring weekdays, Bombay Palace has a lunch buffet ($12) which is not as extensive as Brar's offering but much better in terms of quality and service. The owner of this location and the staff are extremely courteous and hospitable. BP has local business clientele, where as Brar's appeals more to families and children.\n\nThey offer the option of made-to-order flavoured paranthas and roti in the buffet line-up, thus not limiting you to the doughy naans -so that's a huge plus in my books. The buffet has a decent variety of vegetarian and meat dishes, as well as Pani Puri and Chaat Papri. \n\nI recommend the tandoori chicken as it's really well-made and tender on the inside. I'm docking one star, since the rasmalai for desert seemed to actually be a flattened syrupy rasgulla instead of a creamy rasmalai. \n\nAll in all I'd definitely come back.
