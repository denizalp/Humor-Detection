Surprisingly, my short stay at the Luxor Hotel was quite nice. We arrived at 1am on a Thursday night and the line to check-in was really long. However, when we went up to the registration counter (finally), Bri, the girl who helped us, was really nice and super pleasant! I really loved her great customer service.\n\nWe arrived in our room in the tower and it was better than expected. There was a tub and a shower in separate areas so it made the bathroom really big. The room was clean and was decorated nicely.\n\nCheck out was a little confusing because it didn't work on the TV (yes, you can check out on your TV now) so we had to call and follow the prompts on the phone to check out.\n\nOverall, my stay was really great even though we only stayed one night at the hotel.\n\nI would definitely come back!
