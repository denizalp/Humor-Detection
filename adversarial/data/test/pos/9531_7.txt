3.75 \n\nFTR I am NOT a fan of flat fried burgers, I prefer grilled over a flame. Man I love the taste of a fire kissed hunk of ground beef. \n\nI read a few reviews and thought I should at least try the burger. I am glad I did. \n\nHand pattied, fresh burgers, flat grilled to well done but still juicy. The beef had almost 0 flavor by itself but added nice texture to the entire burger as a whole. As a burger \"traditionalist\" I ordered the regular with bacon, lettuce, tomato's, pickle and mustard. No Jalapenos or cool little add ons. The condiments were all really fresh and had good flavor. (most tomato's lack this now a days) The double patty was a little much, I may go with the single next time. \n\nThe building was busy with customers and staff, they run a tight ship. \n\nThe prices can get a little high unless you eat smart, the frys are large, the burgers are large and the drinks are $2.19 for a large. Get the single burgers, share a fry and get water or skip the frys and eat the free peanuts.LOL \n\nI will go back.\n\n4 stars for a flat top grilled burger... must have been good.
