NEW MANAGEMENT * NEW MENU* DECOR IMPROVEMENT* MUCH BETTER FOOD! Potential for 5 stars (should have renamed restaurant to match the new identity)\n\nThe only thing the same about Kitchen 18 is the address and that it is still a kosher restaurant that serves fully inspected meats unlike randomly inspected non-kosher meat. Only disease free animals are used. Grass Fed beef comes from the front quarter of the cow and the back end is sold to non-kosher plants. For these reasons meat platters do cost more than from non-kosher places. \n\nThe menu offers a lot of variety but includes Middle Eastern Mediterranean Foods, SUSHI, Chinese style food, American Food and International Specials.\n\nWe shared a variety of plates and started with Spicy Tuna Sushi. The tuna was clean tasting but not spicy. The rice was rolled nicely and didn't fall apart. Light soy, wasabi paste, a creamy sweet and slightly spicy sauce, a sweet kind of teriyaki and pickled ginger were served with the sushi. \n\nThe Mediterranean Platter had very above average Falafels that were made with fresh herbs. The Falafels are what I'd call the crunchy meatball style that most but not all restaurants serve. The Baba Ganoush was AMAZING. Fire Charred Eggplant with just the right spices and textures. I haven't come across any better in Phoenix or Glendale. Hummus creamy and above average and also above average fluffy fresh pita bread.\n\nShawarma Plate was also OUTSTANDING. The Chicken Meat had that really super perfect juicy texture and Flavor. So moist and seasoned just so. It might have been the BEST Chicken Shawarma I ever had. Blows away the shawarma I tried from other Mediterranean Restaurants I've been to lately. Skhug sauce (red pepper hot sauce)  was a different style that I am used too. It was very hot and tasty and made with dried spicy peppers. The Grilled Vegetables that came on the plate were very delicious. Pita bread was very above average and was light and fluffy and fresh made.\n\nI note since this is a kosher restaurant I wouldn't expect the Chinese Food or even the sushi to be the best. Haven't sampled enough of the menu to award 5 stars but they do serve some winners here and the Mediterranean Food was above average for sure!\n\nVery much worth a try for the Shawarma and Baba Ganoush
