Here's my take. First off the shit is free before 9 o clock or whenever they charge a cover so if you're a smart mutha fucka like myself you get your stamp then and then you're good for all night. Second, even when they do charge a cover it's only like $10 bucks, if you can't handle a $10 cover in Vegas then what in the blue fuck are you doing there? You got the \"Coyotes\" up in there doing the dancing thing and they seem to have all genres of lady, black, white, brunette, blonde, thick, slim, tom boyish etc. There seem to be a good bit of international cougars in here like from Europe and Australia, they let em dance on the stage so you can see which one you wanna holla at and then when they come down you swoop on em and introduce yourself like a gentleman and offer the lady a drink. It's what the fuck gentleman do. Drinks aren't the cheapest but you can pre-game at the bar outside and then go in there ready to meet you a nice young lady so you can enjoy your evening and have a Vegas moment.
