Meh, I tried both flaming cheese appetizers, my dish (some chicken) and the moose caca (I'm going to be hug alive for that one).\n\nThis was one of those dates you go on and its supposed to be the perfect match for you....you smile and laugh at all the strategic times, say your gonna call...and well then do the respectable thing and don't...ever...\n\nIts kinda like that here for me.  It just didn't do it for me, I tried I really did, but I lost the number (or something)...
