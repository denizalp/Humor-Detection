I visited Rice Paper last week. I was promptly greeted but the one thing I noticed in the bar\/dining area was a putrid smell. I was really hungry so I moved to the sitting area closest to the door where it was fine. The service was extremely slow considering it wasn't even lunch time. The food was just okay. I've had better Pho and spring rolls for half the price I paid at Rice Paper. In addition the chicken Pho made both my guest and I sick later that evening. With that said, we should have followed our guts and left but it was a painful learning experience. We will not me back again.
