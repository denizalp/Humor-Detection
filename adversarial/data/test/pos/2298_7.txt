Perhaps I stayed too long...\nWas recently at NYNY for 9 nights for work reasons and figured any of the big name hotels on the Strip would be just fine.  Sadly, by the end of my stay I had a little collection of less than favorable remarks for my Yelp entry, not the least of which was the fact that they didn't change the sheets on the bed until I left a note with an arrow pointing at what looked like some previous guest's dried nosebleed stain that the maid was I guess trying to ignore - Ewww.  On to better topics.. their premiere steakhouse.  On my first night, I sat at the bar and ordered a wedge salad, glass of Cabernet, and a filet. The wine and salad were fine, but the steak was so overdone that when the bartender came to ask how it was, she answered her own question by saying \"oh that's embarrassing.\"  She had the host come and take the hockey puck away.  When the host brought a new one he said it was the least they could do because after all, they ARE a steak house and should be able to cook a steak. Yep.  Okay, so everyone has an off night, and I figured maybe since I was sitting at the bar, they didn't make their best presentation... several nights later, I thought I'd give it another try.  Came back to hotel from work, stopped at hostess stand and made a reservation for a couple hrs later and requested to dine this time at a small table - went and worked-out, showered, got dressed for the evening and came back to start it off with a lovely dinner.  They put me all the way back in the furthest room in the darkest corner.  Not exactly the right way to make a single diner feel comfortable or ever want to come back!      No problem, because there are a few other restaurants in NYNY.. none that are spectacular, but lots of street vendor hot pretzels and pizza slices, so you at least won't starve.  My fave dining experience was the night I went to the upstairs bar at \"9 Fine Irishmen\".  The bartender Dave made me feel welcome, suggested a great salmon, poured a good glass of wine and made conversation - I even enjoyed the Irish band that started playing at 9pm - a really fun evening! \nAs far as the staff at NYNY goes, there were some interesting inconsistencies. The front desk folks, players club folks and concierge were all fantastic - accommodating, happy to assist, and competent.  The duds were at the pool and Starbucks.  The boy at the towel stand wielded his \"one-towel-per-customer\" policy like nobody's business.. which would've been fine if it hadn't been perfectly alright to have two towels the day before and the day after, so I don't know what his story was.. But the Starbucks ladies are not to be missed!  They are the rudest, slowest, most unenthusiastic bunch of Starbucks employees I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with!  Each morning, I left my room a good 15 mins early to get down there and stand in line to watch the slow progression of guests get manhandled by these women.  Monique or Monica even told me one morning (after the players club employees had trained me to use my players club card with every purchase in the hotel to get points or comps) that she had already entered the number.. she hadn't even looked at the card, so just to entertain myself I walked over to the players club desk and inquired about whether my Starbucks purchase had registered on my card... nope.  They of course made up for her laziness (and untruthfulness) and gave me credit for the purchase.  So if you want to feel like Piper Chapman in an episode of \"Orange is the New Black\" standing in the food line in prison, make sure to stop by the Starbucks each morning during your stay at New York New York!
