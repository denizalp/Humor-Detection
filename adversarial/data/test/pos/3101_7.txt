To start this review, yes, I speak Spanish and although I am used to Banda and Norte√±o, I also enjoy going to a salsa\/bachata club such as this one and the dj mix was pretty good.\nIt is an interesting mix of things here but the rip off atmosphere was a terrible experience.\nFirst, I called ahead to make reservations or see what the options were. We were told to just come by and not have any issues.\n\nWe arrived at this place via taxi and then the bouncer announced it over the radio that we arrived via taxi so that was a red flag already.\nFrom there on, everyone we ran into seemed to want to get paid. Everyone had a comment or story to get tipped or over tipped which felt really abusive.\nWe tried to look for a place to sit but most of the tables stated that they were reserved. . . well that pissed me off since we were told that we didn't need to make a reservation (and we arrived upon opening).\nSo in order to get a table, we asked about the bottle service and the waitress looked excited and told me that it started at $185 which is not entirely true as I saw $235 was more like the price she should be giving people. I read the disclaimer on the bottom of the menu and it stated that it included everything as well as gratuities so I thought that was actually a pretty good deal then. She brought the bottle and two juices and a bill for $295? She then also proceeded to tell me that the tip was not included but not mandatory and really pushed to have me tip her. So I found that a bit confusing and misleading. With distrust, I handed her $50 cash and then never saw her again?! There were bus boys that came by rarely to refill the juice but definitely didn't feel like bottle service. it was terrible! But hey, I guess I got a $350 table to sit at.\n\nBecause I had such a poor experience, I decided to interview the front area cashier as well as the bathroom attendant for more information on gratuities. . . which costed me $20 to get to talk to them of course. And they told me right straight with confidence that the bottle service already came all inclusive. I then told them about my situation and the story changed immediately to backing up their coworker instead. It was a very fishy night but at least they knew how to band together.\n\nOf course, to end the night, I asked for a taxi. I saw everyone who were waiting for one and everyone who was ever at the front area since I was trying to be a good host to my friend. When the taxi came for us, while everyone knew we were waiting for one outside patiently, I saw a new person that just stole our ride totally not in line for the taxi we waited for 20 min in the cold.\nGranted, with my obvious anger, after another 15 minutes, they asked their shuttle driver to take us back to our hotel. We knew how much it costed to get to the club via taxi during traffic hours so we knew not to pay more than that. When he grabbed us at the front of the club, he seemed to be polite and courteous. When he left the club and had us in the van, he started asking me for an \"optional\" $40. I really don't understand this place? Are you guys starving? or are you used to drunk people that you think you can take advantage of? Lucky for me, I was not drunk and recall all of this as well as told him I knew how much it costed me to get here. So then he looked guilty and said to give him what I felt like giving him. What a terrible place with terrible workers.\n\nIt was important that I write this review so people who do enjoy music and the Latin theme, keep your wallet in check and watch your bill closely. These guys are thieves.
