Do not be fooled by the name - all of these Hibachi Grill & Supreme Boofay's popping up around town are under different ownership, with quite different recipes coming from the kitchens.\n\nthis location claims to be the largest in the valley, but it must mean sq. footage or something, because the selection was lacking. There seemed to be a ton of food trays, it's just that nothing very good was in them.  A lot of repetetive dishes, a lot of starchy  filler-uppers. \n\nWay too much non-chinese food.  If i wanted hot dogs, kelbasa, chicken nuggets, etc i'd go to Old Timers boofay, not a China Boofay.\n\nEverything in the place seems to have an oily sheen from it's time spent cooking in the deep fryer, since this seems to be the only way anything is prepared.\n\nThe entry way is impressive looking, and if you're not really paying much attention, you may get beguiled by the flashy lights and clanking knives of the live sushi and hibachi chefs, but do not be fooled.\n\nThis is ameri-chino fare at it's most mediocre, and not worth the price they charge.
