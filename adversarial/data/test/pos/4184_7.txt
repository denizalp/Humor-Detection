The food was ok. We were seated outside which was the best part of the lunch. Our waitress Maggie wasn't the friendliest\nBecause of the horrible customer service I \nwouldn't come back. It was my husband's bday and her service was so terrible I didn't even order his dessert. We just wanted the check so we could continue our celebration where all customer's are appreciated.
