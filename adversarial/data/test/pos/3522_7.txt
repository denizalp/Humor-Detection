Love this place!\n\nWe went to the later showtime.\nIt was not packed. Plenty of seats. No bad seat in the house ^_^\n\nThe cast interacted, and kept us engaged throughout.\n\nThey offer snacks, adult bevies, at reasonable cost.\nNo minimum to purchase.\n\nTix cost varied. However, we paid 10.00 per person due to coupon code.\n\nPlenty of parking as well.
