I never would have thought a Vietnamese restaurant would put me in the holiday mood, but it did! I will get to my reasoning, but first let me say why I'm giving Rice Paper five stars. It's because they have an adorable restaurant with a perfect atmosphere, they have delicious food and they have friendly staff. \n\nRice Paper is situated on a busy Phoenix road but once inside the adorable little historic house, it feels like you've been transformed into a home away from home. They restored a historic house and adapted it into a restaurant that can accommodate those looking for a meal or those looking for some cocktails alike. The atmosphere is very modern zen-like with each table places perfectly apart from each other, quaint light fixtures warming up the restaurant and a long bar with seating and plenty of drinks to choose from.\n\nMost importantly is the food. The food here is delicious. It's the perfect combination of filling yet light. We started with the spring rolls and here I must warn you that if you order one that has \"spice\" mentioned at all in the description, be warned that they do not go light on the Sriracha. The spring roll was delicious but so spicy, my mouth burned for a good 20 minutes following. I think I also made the mistake of drinking diet coke in attempt to ease the burning but it really only made it worse. The burn from Sriracha seems to only disappear if you power through it. \n\nRice Paper is know for their Pho so it's a must to order it! I went with the chicken Pho and this is where I entered into the holiday spirit. The Pho is warm and filled with wintry spices that remind me of Christmas with each warm sip. If I closed my eyes I could have imagined looking outside to see a crisp snow-filled day (instead of busy 7th street on a 70 degree day). I actually ordered the vegetarian Pho and added chicken in order to get all the vegetables. It was the perfect meal. It was filling but felt light and didn't put me into an afternoon food coma. \n\nI can see Rice Paper being the perfect spot for a date night or lunchtime meeting. It's great to stop by for an appetizer and cocktails before heading out for the night, or making this your main stop for the night and staying for a meal.
