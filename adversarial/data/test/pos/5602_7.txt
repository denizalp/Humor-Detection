Popped in to this assembly line CVS after brunch nearby. It's nice and simple and has all the accoutrements of every other CVS. Well stocked shelves with personal care, medications, even food and drinks. Candy of course.\n\nThe pharmacy has a drive through.\n\nNow I'm suddenly wondering what the heck \"CVS\" stands for. Hello, Google. It's \"Consumer Value Stores\". Now you know. And knowing is half the battle.
