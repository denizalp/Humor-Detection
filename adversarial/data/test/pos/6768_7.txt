It has been many years since I had a baby to buy for, so I found myself as a new customer here, having not been since my twins were 12 or so.\n The aisles are wide, wonderfully wide, so easy to drive the carts through!\n The store is clean, well lit, divided into categories of toys so you can see what's offered.\n I needed a playpen, and one of those little roller things to put babies in so they can be mobile. They offered a better choice than anywhere else, and prices were the same or less. I got one of each, and love them both!\n The only bad point is as the lack of attention. There were employees, they just didn't \"see\" any customers. I didn't get a single word spoken to me til I was in line to pay.\n There the cashier made it up to me. Due to several health issues its hard for me to lift or move my neck. The cashier asked if I'd need help out, I said no. Then I mentioned if I did need help I'd come back in and ask. She grabbed the phone and paged another employee. She said that way he'd be there if I needed him. LOL\n He helped me out, loaded them up, AND took the cart back in!\n That was a GREAT way to make up the glitch if no greetings earlier.\n I'll be back.
