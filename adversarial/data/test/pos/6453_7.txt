When I fly US Airways, it's usually somewhere between an A-OK and meh experience. If you're the type of person that doesn't care about anything other than getting from one place to another, often times you won't have any problem. But if you occasionally fly and have tried other airlines AND have a choice, it's good to know some things:\n\n-You won't get any snacks, unless you pay for them.\n-Soda, juice, coffee, and water are free, so that's nice.\n-$25 bag check? Damn! Make sure your carry-on isn't bulging, yo.\n-My interactions with flight attendants have just been okay. I haven't experienced anyone go above and beyond, though.\n-If you have an aisle seat, be careful about sticking your elbows out. Dem carts might smash them.\n-I've had the worst flight of my life from Phoenix to Honolulu. I get that it's rare that a flight DOESN'T have turbulence, but I could've sworn we dropped several hundred feet in a second because it was so bad. Even the flight attendants were saying, \"oh crap.\"\n\nI usually roll with #teamunited or #teamdelta and have four or five-star experiences with them, and would choose them over #teamusairways.
