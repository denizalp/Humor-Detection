I should preface this review by pointing out that I come here every January 1st for a big family gathering. Thus, I have given this 3 stars because while I like the place, I'm not sure if they might potentially merit more than three stars. Since the restaurant is closed for our private gathering, we have a fixed menu - it's possible that their regular a la carte menu deserves a higher rating. \n\nLocation: On the North Shore, about 10-minutes from Laval and 20-25 minutes from downtown.\n\nService: Considering that we are always a very large group, the service is pretty good. I think they could potentially have 1-2 more waiters on hand, however the restaurant runs two private functions - one upstairs and one downstairs, so I'm guessing they split their limited staff to cater to both parties. \n\nFood: The last few years have seen the exact same menu items on the list, and I had grown so incredibly bored of these that I wasn't really looking forward to this year's event. Well the laugh was on me because they revamped our menu entirely. Here's what I had:\n\nSalad: This was your average, run-of-the-mill salad. Leaves but no veggies besides some shredded carrot. Very low on the vinaigrette. That said, the salad was fresh. It just could've used a little sprucing up.\n\nEscargots: I chose this as my 2nd course and despite the cream-based sauce, the snails were surprisingly good. They were fat and tender - not at all dry or shriveled up. Had I been paying attention when the wait staff explained the menu items, I would be able to tell you what kind of cream the escargots were bathing in - but sadly, I was not. The dish was very good, though there was more sauce than snails. A few more would have been good. \n\nMain: I opted for chicken stuffed with prosciutto in a basil sauce, accompanied by veggies and potatoes. Here's the thing: the chicken was AMAZING. It was tender and no knife was needed - I just used my fork and that was that. The prosciutto wasn't overpowering so the combination of bird and pork was perfect. The potatoes were a bit dry, so the solution to that would be to add a bit more sauce. The veggies were good. \n\nI skipped dessert - I hate white cake with caramel sauce. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here and would definitely be interested in checking them out on a regular night to see how they fare.\n\nThe decor is kind of country-style and rather dark. I like a little more light.
