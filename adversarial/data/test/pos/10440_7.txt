ONE HELL OF A SHOW\n\nIf I live 1,000 years I doubt I will ever see a show quite like this.  There are so many mind-blowing stunts and nuances that you will be on the edge of your seat the entire time (keep a close and curios eye on that Volkawagen Bug).  \"Love\" even excels among other amazing Vegas shows.\n\nThis show made me so happy to live in a world that was privileged enough to be privy to the music of The Beatles.  In fact, immediately after the show I felt compelled to fly to Liverpool, scale Paul McCartney's perimeter wall and brave a swarm of guard dogs to tell Paul how happy I was;  I wanted to contact a medium so I could pass the word along to George of how happy I was; I wanted to take a trip to Uganda, board a boat in the town of Kampala, sail down to Bugala Island, meet with a witch doctor that could summon the dead and ask him to conjure up the soul of John Lennon so I could tell him how happy I was; & I wanted to maybe send a letter in the mail to Ringo to tell him how happy I was (I'd send him an email but I don't have his address).
