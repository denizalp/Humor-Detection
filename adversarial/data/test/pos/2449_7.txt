sa-horor.\n\nI rather stay at a motel.\n\nThe suite is just a regular crappy room, but bigger. I feel dirty even after I showered... There's no \"do not disturb\" door signs to put on your door, so early in the morning the cleaning lady comes by and bangs on the door and just opens it before your eyes could even open with a big \"HELLLLO?!\"\n\nnever again... *chills*\n\nI rather spend 500 bucks.
