The Skinny: came here for Dole whip...which is kind of overpriced for the serving size. (3)\n\nCame here for Dole whip because Dole whip rocks my world. And once a year I get like a huge craving for it. My lovely hubby indulged me by heading out of our way to satisfy my appetite. We ordered it and it came with a little umbrella and maraschino cherry. Cute.\n\nThen I dig in. Ummm....there is kinda of a large hole in the middle of the Dole whip. Lame!\n\nGiven that it cost $4.50 for this relatively small treat, it is pretty pricey for what it is. Sigh! I guess it's okay if you only go back once a year to get your Dole whip groove on. Otherwise, probably should avoid this place.
