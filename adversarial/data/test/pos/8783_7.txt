This moving company sucks!!!!! Never and i mean never use them. they straight out lie and screw you. movers speak no english show up late break items and promise X amt of hours for a set amount of $, then show up say thats not the time promised for the amount of money over charge you. I LITERALLY HOPE EVERYONE THAT WORKS HERE ROTS IN HELL. THE FACT I HAVE TO GIVE U A STAR MAKES ME ILL TO MY STOMACH. YELPERS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!
