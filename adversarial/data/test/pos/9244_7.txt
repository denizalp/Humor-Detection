This was a meal that I left feeling very conflicted about. I'll start off by saying that for something in this price point, you shouldn't run out of the best steak offered on on the menu. \n\nWhen we sat down we were told that they didn't have any of the 40 day dry aged CAB prime ribeye which was pretty disappointing considering that's what a few of us had intended to order (Note: they told us they did have it in the downtown location - so maybe better off going there?) I ended up selecting a cut off of the cab prime menu and the meal was great. My steak in particular was cooked to perfection but some others mentioned that theirs were a little over\/under done - not something I would expect for a steakhouse. I've definitely had better steak in Cleveland. \n\nI also had the roasted beet & arugula salad and sampled quite a few of the signature sides all of which were absolutely amazing! I was also really impressed with their wine menu.\n\nTheir cheesecake deserves an entire paragraph to itself. Let me tell you I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best cheesecake I've ever had (I've had a lot). They have flavors on a rotating schedule but the night I was there I had the cheesecake with the pear compote topping and I was blown away. I would return for the sole purpose of eating this cheesecake again - it's that good.
