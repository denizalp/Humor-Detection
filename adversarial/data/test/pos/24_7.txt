I am warning you. This review is not gonna be pretty. It starts bad and it ends worse. Is that even possible? Read along and you be the judge. In an attempt to use some of the many Restaurant.com certs that we have laying around, we decided to grab take out one night and finally try Hammered Hog. Upon entering the establishment, my husband was told he could not use the certificate which has no expiration date, mind you. He was then told , how the 'relationship ended very badly' with Restaurant.com. Not really one who likes wasting money nor establishments who don't make good on redeeming things such as this, I think my relationship with Hammered Hog may have ended there, as i would have deemed it unprofessional to not honor a $25 certificate and go into the story with a customer; but, that said, I also tend to be the more impatient of us two in the couple-dom and my husband opted to give Hammered Hog a chance anyway. He ordered a platter. It came with pulled pork; pulled chicken; and hot links; for the sides we got mashed potatoes and gravy; and blue cheese cole slaw. I found the meat to be tasteless. The hot links were good but not spicy and the smallest links i've ever seen in a BBQ restaurant. They are cut up into bite sized pieces .. why?? The pulled chicken was dry and bland and the pulled pork was just blah and watery. The sauces also left little to be desired. The mashed potatoes were pasty and instant .. something served in a hospital would have likely tasted better. What was that texture ??? I was afraid to touch the sludge of mess they labeled as 'gravy' -- KID you not, brown, lumpy sludge! And to round out this less than stellar $35 meal..the blue cheese cole slaw ? Literally was cole slaw with some blue cheese dressing ( again with NO flavor ) drizzled on top, it seemed. This meal just aggravated me to no end. The portion size was okay , but no offense .. who cares? I didn't finish my small plate of this waste because it wasn't worth my calories, and i don't like eating things that I don't like. There are some really GOOD BBQ places in Phoenix for it not being a 'BBQ area' like Kansas City, North Carolina or the deep heart of Texas. This.. isn't one of them. Save your time, your money, and your taste and go somewhere else when you have a hankering for BBQ takeout next time. This place is hammered alright .. and not in a good way.
