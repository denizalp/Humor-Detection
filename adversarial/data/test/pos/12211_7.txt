Overall, just an okay boba joint.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ mango syrup used in iced tea (it's made with real fruit, apparently!)\n\nTHE MEH:\n~ tea flavor, just gets overshadowed by the syrup\n~ 50 shades darker aka Vietnamese coffee (just not my cup of tea)\n\nTHE BAD:\n- boba (not perfectly chewy, but mushy) \n\nSide note: just as preference, the default sweetness level was too sweet for me. If you're anything like me and enjoy a more subtle sweetness, ask for 50% or less sweetness if possible. \n\nOverall, would probably come back for the ice cream because the nitrogen aspect looked cool af, but wouldn't rush back for the boba drinks.
