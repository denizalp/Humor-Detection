We LOVE this place!! I've been twice and both times were an absolute blast! The instructors are great and Brad (the General Manager) was very helpful with the reservation process. I made reservations and then had to make some changes and they were very accommodating! My only suggestion is to bring some bottles of water for after your \"flight\". You walk out and are VERY dry mouthed! I think for the cost, the company should give each person a bottle of water after they are done!
