The reviews are true!!!!\n\nPicture windows, glass sliders, tracks, indoor and outdoor, fur kids didn't mind the guys, double sliders, according doors, small windows on exterior doors.....A+.\n\nShawn the owner set up my appointment and a appointment was available the next few days.\n\nThe two guys wore booties and were very quiet, hardly noticed they were here.\n\nThe outside of our windows and screens had lots of hard water and dirt build up. They scrubbed and made them sooooo see through...a fur kid bumped smack into the back slider! :D \n\nAlmost thirty tiny to super large were cleaned, tracks were cleaned, great job! Our 30? job was $265 and the guys were here about 3.5 hours. I had to run errands but husband saw them off with a check. \n\nI will continue to hire J&J for our window scrubbing needs!
