Not to be a poke snob, but Poke Express is the best in town. From their small counter at a local Hawaiian joint to their own brand new location, Poke Express stills reign supreme and my first choice place to get poke. How lucky am I to have this place so close to where I live! \nEverything I've had from the ahi, salmon, taegu, mussels, or imitation crab is fresh and full of flavor! They even have section to buy Hawaiian brand products and groceries. \n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n59\/100
