Stopped by for a quick lunch because I liked the place that use to be in this location.  This location has been a couple of pizza shops and a hot dog shop in between.  \nAnyway, there are specials going on for the opening.  We had a pizza with pepperoni.  The crust is medium in thickness and was well cooked and a little crunchy.  The sauce and cheese were good.  The people in the shop were very friendly.
