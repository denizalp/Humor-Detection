A gorgeous little taste of nature here. Just 1 hour out of downtown Toronto, it makes for a stunning photo session, and an easy walk. I would even hesitate to call it a \"hike\" because there are routes that are very easy to navigate. However, some of the steeper slopes you come across means running shoes, at least, are a must.\n\nParking is just off the road, and can be tricky because of the slopes in the road. Be careful, in case passing through traffic doesn't slow down! \n\nAccording to a recent news article, it looks like by the end of May 2015, the Badlands will be fenced off and closed from visitors to prevent further damage. Ironically, this article is probably sparking a ton of visitors before it closes off!
