I love Public Butter!!!\nIt's one of my favourite stores in Toronto (although I wish it was as cheap as Black Market!)\n\nTODAY I was in Public Butter and walked up to the cash register and waited in line to find a very rude customer (Robert C, just wrote his own review) demanding a refund, although you cannot get refunds. I heard him claim there was a defect in what he was purchasing (to which I say, it's a second hand store, things may have defects. If you bought it, you should have inspected it first.) In every second hand store I have come across returns and refunds are not accepted. He was very rude to the cashier, although she called the owner and talked about a refund, WHICH she gave to him. $100 in store credit. You could tell she was trying her hardest to stay professional, but he was being very rude. She was very upset, and I understand why. As someone who works in customer service, it is very hard to stay professional when someone is being intensely rude to you. She handled the situation accordingly, in my opinion. \n\nShe got him the refund, and he was still a huge asshole to her.\n\nI am often in Public Butter, and I have never had a problem with customer service. \n\nSometimes you just have to play by the rules, Robert.
