Too many commercials for these Nacho Fries...time to give them a try! I visited Taco Bell in the drive thru and only ordered the Nacho Fries. \n\nQuick visit and the drive thru line went quickly. I got home and cracked open the nacho cheese and dipped one of the fries. At first the fries reminded me of Red Robin fries but after a couple more, not as much seasoning. They were lightly seasoned and tasted good...but not great. Would I order them again? Yes, I think they would be a good snack with any combination of food from Taco Bell. Overall 3\/5.
