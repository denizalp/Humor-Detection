We went there Sunday night for the Roller Boogie party that had Sugar Hill Gang playing..or should I say rapping. They were the ones that invented it so you have to give em credit.\nMe and Hubby brought our own skates..cuz were cool like that. It was perfect for rollerskating. A perfect circle to sk8 around and playing all of the old roller rink songs. Plenty of people dressed for the occasion. we sure did. We went 80's all the way..I wore hot pink hot pants!\nWe got into the line and thought we would have to pay something cuz I did not get in touch w\/VIP host..we walked right in..did not have to pay. That was awesome cuz I saw plenty of other peeps paying. we drank..we skated. Saw the oldest rappers ever & they kicked ass. It was a super night out for this mommy who dont get out much these nights..LOL
