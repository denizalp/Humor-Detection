Styxx was seen here when he was in rescue. He was due for shots so I brought him and Flynn for their vaccines. \n\nEVERYONE was super nice. They had history on my baby I didn't know about & clarified other concerns Styxx had they originally treated. \n\nAll vaccines are $10....yay for low cost. I expected our bill to be $175 and it was MUCH less. Much much less. Shots for 2 dogs, nail trims, 2 toothbrushes, toothpaste AND dental chews were $169. \n\nVery nice location & facility. Living in GVR we will make this drive once a year. Hopefully it's once a year...
