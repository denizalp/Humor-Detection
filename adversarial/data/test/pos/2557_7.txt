I. Love. the Aria. sooooo much. I've stayed there 3 times now and I am ready to move in. \n\nThe lobby is BEAUTIFUL, smells like vanilla, and several times when I've walked in, Oasis started playing. Anyone who knows me knows I have an unhealthy obsession with Oasis, so that alone was magical serendipity and sold me on the place pretty quickly. \n\nOkay so, the rooms. Let's start with the beds. The wonderful, cloud-like heavenly beds. You can buy all the bedding if you have a few thousand dollars to spare, which I don't, but someday. The lights, curtains, music, etc are all controllable from an iPad-like device next to your bed which is great because like I said, the beds are heaven and you won't want to ever leave it. But if you do have to leave the bed to shower or something, you're rewarded with a beautiful bathroom with a monster huge soaking tub. Ahhh so nice.\n\nI wish I could give an opinion on the restaurants there, but I only ate at one and it was really late at night and I was pretty drunk so I don't remember much but I'm pretty sure it was great.\n\nThe pools, and there are 3 or 4 of them, are really nice. There's an adults-only pool club party...thing but it looked full of skinny tan attractive girls, all of which I am not so I stayed away because attractive people intimidate me. So I was happy to lounge by the pool with the rest of the average-looking people.\n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting something but to sum it up, the Aria is beautiful and magical and you should stay there.
