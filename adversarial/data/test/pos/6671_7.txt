Oh the HORROR!! \n\nI can here on a lunch date with my husband and two year old. We had an hour since it was on my husbands lunch break, and decided on this place because I was craving some \"street tacos\", and the reviews\/pictures looked awesome.... oh how I was wrong!!\n\nSeems easier to number all the issues we had!\n\n1. We walk in at 12:10 to a nearly empty restaurant, I first try to use the bathroom, and the light wasn't working... that should have been my first clue. \n2. We sit down and a few minutes later the place is packed, but for some reason everyone has been help except us!?! \n3. Finally someone comes to help, I ordered the horchata since it was mentioned so frequently in the reviews, my husband ordered a Sierra Mist (remember it came in a to-go cup with a lid)  The horchata was bizarra, and $4\n4. My 2 year old daughter grabs the free chips.. and I see MOLD on it, then realize the whole basket is full of moldy chips!! No wonder they are free!\n5. A different waiter finally shows up since the other waitress was busy taking care of the customers that came AFTER us... I ordered the Sonora Arrachera Taco, and told them about the MOLDY chips, he apologized and took the chips away.  The original waitress came back, apologized for the chips, and said she would comp the drinks, I returned the horchata, and got a Sierra Mist as well (also came in a to-go cup, there's a reason I am mentioning this)\n6. After 20 min and being there for 40 and food had not arrived I asked for it to-go. about 5 min later it came along with the bill that only included the food.\n\nBy this point I was annoyed but probably wouldn't have given it 1 star, so we leave with to-go cups in hand along with food. I dropped my husband off at work, then drove home. When I got home I ate 1 taco which was pretty good, the meat was flavorful and tender, I only wished I had some of that salsa to add to it. Then I got a text from my husband.....\n\n7. My husband asks \"is your Sierra Mist BROWN??? I  open the lid and sure enough it looks like dirty water!!!\n\nSeconds later the entire meal... is in the trash! VOMIT!   I gave this place more chances then I ever give a place. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!
