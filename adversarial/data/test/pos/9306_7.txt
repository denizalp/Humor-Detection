Vintage's overall rating is a 3.5 and that seems accurate.\n\nWe had planned on having lunch at the Old Fashioned but as usual Capitol Square was a total clusterf*#k. Plan B - lunch at Vintage because it was close to our destination and it was open. Turned out to be a pretty good call.\n\nI love the interior - warm, and full of \"vintage\" touches. Like super awesome old beer lamps, rotary phones and great advertising art. They've got a big bar area which I'm sure is a great place to watch the Badgers. \n\nThe Mister started off with a stout ($5\/pint) which he liked, and I went with a Moscow Mule, my drink was well made, properly served in a copper mug and reasonably priced at $6. We also had chese curds which were crispy, gooey snd very nice.\n\nFor lunch proper, he had the Home Grown burger which is served with arugula and fresh apple. That's not normally a thing he'd order but he loved it - I had a bite and was surprised at how well apples go on a burger. I went with the Gobble Gobble which is homemade pulled turkey, stuffing, homemade cranberry relish and a side of gravy (!) for dipping. I liked it but it was overly salty - maybe that comes from the stuffing? You'll have your choice of sides - go for the tots. Always go for the tots.\n\nService? Okay, not super attentive but very nice.\n\nHey Vintage, I've got an amazing menu idea for you. Take those tasty tots, pile on some of that homemade turkey and add some of that lovely gravy. Bam - THANKSGIVING POUTINE! Just remember where the idea came from when it gets you on the Food Network, okay?
