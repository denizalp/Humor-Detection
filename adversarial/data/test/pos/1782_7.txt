I go for the view.  Great place to lounge, without being in a club atmosphere.  Love the bouncers.  They're friendly and cool, not snobby like most places.  Know what you're doing and flash a smile (some cleavage helps too) and they won't charge you a cover.  The couple before us got charged $10 each.  It also helps when you're a group of 4 chicks.  It wasn't even crowded that night, but the music was old school and I liked it.  Anyways, I'm there for the view.  They have a small section of plexiglass on the floor outside looking down from the 55 stories.  I love to watch idiot (or drunk or both) tourists jump on it, and have the bouncers come over and tell them to stop.  Yes, I'm easily entertained.
