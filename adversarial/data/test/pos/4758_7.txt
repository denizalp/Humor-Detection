My wish has come true! \nNot only is there now an Einstein Bros Bagels near my home, but it's THE BEST Einstein's I've possibly ever seen :D Nope, not even kidding!! \n\nHere's what I found:\n-Large building\n-Very organized ordering line\n-Well designated coffee\/drink self serve station\n-LOTS of tables (seating for 6, 4, 2 & single seating at a window bar) indoors\n-Covered patio outdoor seating \n-WiFi (& the connection is so cute, it's titled BagelNet, lol)\n-Doggies are welcomed in the patio seating area!\n-Plenty of parking\n-Friendly staff\n-DRIVE THROUGH\n\nI found not a single negative thing :) \nI'll have to keep coming back just to make sure ;)
