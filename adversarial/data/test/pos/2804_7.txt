Salt & Pepper and I go waaay back. I used to visit with my family when it first opened, and was the only one in Calgary. It's retained a lot of the same attributes: it's small, but not so small that I feel crowded. No more so than restaurants I've been to in New York City. Parking is ample. They have a great patio during the summer months.\n\nThe food is good - it's not inherently spicy, but if you ask they will provide. It's pretty tasty and a little more authentic than what you get generally in Calgary. It's more authentic overall than the other S&P locations, in my opinion. \n\nThe margaritas are awesome - we had two each of the lime. The staff was friendly and attentive. They treated us kindly even though we had a deal coupon (I don't see that everywhere - once they know you bought a deal, some places treat you like vermin).\n\nAll in all, I need to visit more often - it's one of those places I truly enjoy coming to, even if the location is a little in-the-middle-of-nowhere-ish.
