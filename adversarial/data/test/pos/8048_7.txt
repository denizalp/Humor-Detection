Mi casa es la casa de las enchiladas! YUMMALICIOUS!  After reading Julia S, Chad E and Faith D's thumbs up reviews, I knew I was on my way.  I went with one of my friends and we ordered a plate of four enchiladas and some flank steak thrown on for good measure!  I don't know which one was my favorite, all I know is that I could not cram it down my mouth fast enough, it was delicious. I guess if I had to choose, the mole and the verde were my favorite.   I might want to go back very soon.\n\nAny restaurant that I walk in and I am the only honky, hot salsa, fresh jalapenos and servers that barely speak English.  Dude, I'm there.  Oh, wait, also coke in the bottle. Yay!!\n\nDisclaimer, some servers speak English, just ours didn't.  Fun visit.\n\nDisclaimer Part Deux: The restaurant formally known as La Casa de la Enchilada is now Three Amigos. Same location and same great food!!!
