Ok- my biggest problem was that I had at my disposal either yelp check in coupon  for 15% off AND the 15% off one handed out at the nearby hotel I was saying at (downtown grand) but what sucked was neither is accepted at happy hour which is why I went to this establishment- I think both the coupon here at yelp or  the hotel should have stated it. My meal ran about $16 so I would of saved a bit to tip more...just saying\n\nThat said, it was super slow when I arrived. Servers were cut but mine was a nice rocker girl. She got busy after a bit but still was attentive. I got the meatballs, calamari and personal pizza ( the meat one). Meats and calamari were great, pizza was ok and a good size. I took half of it back to my room for snacking later. \n\nThe place works for happy hot adjacent to the hotel and area of downtown3rd.
