When searching for a coffee shop that serves reliably good coffee that suits your palette, sometimes one simply has to rely on the best.\n\nAfter checking out the list of coffee shops in the area, we couldn't find a local coffee shop that specialized in coffee. So we decided to hit the local Starbucks as we knew we would get what we expected-great coffee, great flavor and a guarantee that if it wasn't what we ordered they would remake it for us.\n\nWe were not disappointed. The coffee here was the usual high standard that one expects from the number one coffee chain in the world!\n\nEvery Starbucks store has its own unique ambiance and this one had a bit of everything to choose from. It had comfortable chairs, work tables, a large central meeting table, stools and high tables and outside seating as well.\n\nThanks, Starbucks!
