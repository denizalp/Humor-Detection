I was walking down the street thinking about mundane things like how to better organize my closet and suddenly I felt like I was in a cartoon.  You know when a cartoon bear is walking along and suddenly a smell cloud wanders through the air and he sniffs and follows it until he spots an amazing picnic through the bushes?  It was JUST like that.  Except the scent cloud in this case consisted of heavenly, cinnamon sugar.\n\nI followed my schnoz to this bakery establishment and the warm cookies tasted just like the air had smelt.  Ambrosia!\n\nI have since ordered cakes from here and this is where Brûlée shines for me (as I don't just drop in to sample goods often).  I have loved every cake I have purchased (and received lots of compliments on the choices) but my heart truly beats for the Ganache.\n\nMmmm, in my dreams every fridge would open to left-over fried chicken and Brûlée chocolate cake...
