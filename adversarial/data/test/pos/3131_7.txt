Excellent place and it had not been my intention to come here, but the place I was headed was closed on Wednesdays. So, this is where I landed.   Because I checked in on YELP, I automatically got four small pieces of Caribbean chicken.  That enticed me to order their white chicken with mixed veggies and Mac and cheese.  It also came with corn bread.  Absolutely phenomenal!   This restaurant is close to where interstate 77 and Harris Blvd meet.  It is next to a Food Lion, in a very unpretentious location.  The minute you walk in, you feel a Caribbean vibe and also notice how clean it is.  We were lucky that Tony, the owner, came to our table and chatted with us for quite some time.  Who knew he is an Osteopathic Doctor?  He has a million philosophies on health and food and drink and all things spiritual.   If I was not into the food, I would come back to talk with Tony. But, as it is, I will be back for the food and the conversation.    It will be sooner rather than later.
