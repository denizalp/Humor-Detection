Food so good you'll want to slap someone ! This place has hands down the best of the BBQ in the area! \nFrom the minute you walk in the door your nose will smell the delicious aroma of that juicy delicious food. \nMy first few visits were to go - mainly because I couldn't trust myself in public to eat that savory Q without getting it all over myself!\nThe sides oh the sides are so yummy . \nToday's meal was BBQ ribs with coleslaw and Mac and cheese. \nSo good ! \nIf you haven't made your way to a location... I'd say you're missing out big time !\n\nMacs is the place for yummy BBQ in CHARLOTTE and one of the few places that's served beef ribs ! \nThanks Macs !!! Two thumbs way up
