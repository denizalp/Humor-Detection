Kazan Koren Restaurant is a nicely decorated place. This is so chic and modern and has comfortable booth seatings. \n\nWe went there on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM. The place was not too busy and we got sat right away in one of the booth. \n\nWe opted not to have the Teppanyaki which is in a different area of the restaurants with the chef cooking in front on you on the iron plate. \n\nWe ordered the BBQ ribs (2 bones) $21.95, Stir Fried Seafood with Rice $12.95 and Spicy seafood udon soup $9.95. I tried to order brown rice instead of regular white rice, the waiter told me it was sold out since lunch... hmmmm... can they just make more if they know they don't have any since lunch?? \n\nFirst thing that comes was the appetizers which is a pancake with green and red pepper. It tasted a little oily but it is OK. Our waiter did not even realized that we don't have chopsticks or any utensils to eat. \n\nThe other complimentary appetizers is quite tasty: kimchi, mushroom with beef, green beans, egg plant. We were accommodated when we requested for a refill. \n\nThe ribs are quite tasty. The cut is really good, no tendons or chewy part. The stired fried seafood with rice was a little disappointed, the sauce is kind of bland and but the 2 shrimps were nice and fresh squids were cooked perfectly! The seafood udon, I requested extra spicy.. that only come out as mild..with the same seafood..I do like the noodle soup better and it was huge.. they served that in a XL metal bowel! \n\nThe service was a little slow and impersonal. Maybe our waiter is a trainee, he does not really know what he is doing sometimes. He left the dirty serving cart right next to our booth and I have to push it away more than twice. \n\nI prefer going to smaller restaurant that is family runned compared to huge restaurant that is so impersonal. I found the smaller ones do give me a feel how Korean really eats at home and are more authentic. \n\nKazan is great if you have a big group and for sure you will have so much fun watching the chef cooking right in front of you and doing all the tricks! \n\nVISA, MC, Interac, NO Amex \n\nPS You do smell after eating here even no one around you are eating BBQ! I have to wash everything including myself when I get home. However, my dog has so much fun smelling me...
