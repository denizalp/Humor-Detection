I live for aesthetically pleasing cafes, just take all my money!!! Alchemy Coffee is one of them, tucked in a little plaza just a little west of Main Street Unionville & Highway 7. It's very representative of those bougie cafe joints you'd find in Toronto, which is great for those who wanna save the trip of going all the way downtown. \n\nUpon arrival, it was a lot smaller than my friends and I expected and the lighting was quite dim (FYI Alchemy, we need good lighting out here to take pics!!!). Yet, the interior was designed to fit a modern style cafe, which was cute - wooden tables and chairs, black & grey walls...\n\nThe food and drinks itself were also quite pricey - I ended up paying around $20 for a matcha latte and smoked salmon eggs benny. However, the presentation of the food was on par and I loved their hollandaise sauce they used for their eggs Benedict. I also liked how they added some greens to make it look healthier LOL. Not to mention, I love when they serve up my lattes with some latte art (I got a heart heheh) \n\nI'll definitely want to come back here to try the other dishes that have been recommended by many friends and fellow Yelpers - such as the chicken & waffle or the iced version of the matcha latte, as well as their coffee!!!
