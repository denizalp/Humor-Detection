This place is a fucking joke. Pat Hicky is a Dick. He's a liar and screws the little man. Husband got a car almost 30 days ago. Still isn't funded and no bank will fund if because they forgot to put the disposition fee at end of contract. We refuse to sign a new one and they won't give us our money back. Fuck this place.
