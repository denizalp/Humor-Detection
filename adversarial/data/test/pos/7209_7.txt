Hola mis amigos!!!  Ayudame Senor!!!!!  Ayudame!!!!! Seniorita!!! Donde estas??!?!?!  Te amo, mi amor!!!!!  These are the things that I heard My T yelling when I first came into Cardenas.  You would have thought the man was born and raised in Mexico city!  And I have no idea why he was telling someone he loved them.  The whole experience was strange...\n\nI have come here once and had a great food experience.  My T is absolutely right, there is a bit of a language barrier and it can be difficult to order, because not everything is brought to your table.  For instance, if you order the mariscos, you have to take your receipt to a separate section to pick the food up.  And you're lucky if someone is even there to help you in that section.  \n\nWhy 5 stars if it can be difficult to order and even get decent customer service??  Because of the prices!!!  It's way too cheap to complain about anything, and the food quality is great, everything is fresh.  \n\nTacos, tamales, shrimp cocktail, ribs..... Dios mio, es delicioso!!!!!!  Es uno de mis restaurantes favoritos para lunch (como se dice lunch en espanol??)\n\nAdios amores!
