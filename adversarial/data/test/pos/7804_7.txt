This show was slow, boring, and expensive. \n\nI can't believe the amount of 5 stars this show gets. I only saw probably 3 things that really amazed me. The contortionists, the mid-air boat thing, and the woman standing on her head really impressed me. Everything else seemed like fluff or a repeat of what other Cirque shows had. KA was my first Cirque show and that seemed a lot more interesting with the stage. I wished they did more diving from high up. They only dived like 3 times and they didn't really do much tricks. I felt like when i watched the water show on the Oasis of the Seas those divers did a heck of a lot more, and that was with the boat moving! \n\nThose clowns on that house and dancing with two dudes was boring. I was trying so hard to stay awake. I understand that they need to change the stage and the performers need a break but come on... there has got to be more entertaining ways to do this.\n\nWe got seats below the balcony for $160 which I thought had great views.200 levels. I think the price was a little higher since it was Columbus Day holiday, not sure what normal price was. Great thing about those seats were that we didn't have to walk through rows because we got individual seats not next to each other. The drinks were pricey and you could bring your own drinks in but we didn't have time to do it. \n\nIf this is your first Cirque show, you will be amazed. If not, you'll feel like you've seen most of it already.
