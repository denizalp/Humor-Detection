Good food, great ambience, horrible service from BARTENDER JOHN THE CON. I stop in the other weekend for drinks and a bite with friends last and I notice a suspicious bartender behind the bar as the man who has so infested himself in multiple female friends lives, only to lie, cheat, steal, threaten and become violent with them.\nI make my way to the bar to order and start a chat with him, as he doesn't know I know his full past, much like management surely doesnt know his resum√© wasnt even written by him- surely a couple phone calls should help them realize his dishonesty and lack of good service skills.\nBut onto the service! I order and he disappears, after a friend says hello.  He comes back, there is still no food yet after 20 minutes and he makes no mention to go check on it.  I've already ordered a few rounds of drinks for friends at this point and want to buy him one, top shelf- 1942 or Johnnie blue, only to be denied, for which he sends a manager over to explain I cannot.  I try to tell the manager this bartender doesn't have yet one truthful bone in his body, let alone the ability to serve the Greater Gilbert Area with the service OHSO, so demands, yet I'm simply giggled at told to carry on(SWELL!).  My food eventually did come out and was good, but my bartender did not even come to ask how it was or follow up.\nAfter putting it out there to management they have a problem with the service and hiring standards JOHN THE CON tries to have me removed from the premises not only once, but twice! Even as my bill carried up to $150, a well paying customer as myself, was attempted to be kicked out multiple times, simply for alarming staff of the poor service and even poorer man in their midsts.
