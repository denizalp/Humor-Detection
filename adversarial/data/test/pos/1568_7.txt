This is by far the worst experience ever at the food fair!  These old people think they are just the only ones buying food. The old ladies (buyers) are the rudest and most inconsiderate when it comes to these people. I come here every month and spend $150-$200 and this will be the last time. I would rather shop at Bangkok Market than this place. So long!!
