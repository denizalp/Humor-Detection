I frequent this Target very often. I come here almost everyday during my lunch break, just to get a break from being in the office. \n\nThe employees are friendly and it's always very clean. \n\nThe two downsides are that the bathrooms are often gross and it's located across from the light rail. The light rail attracts all types of populations, so sometimes there are panhandlers outside. \n\nThe good thing is that there is often police officers outside of the store, so it helps keep the area safe. \n\nI am definitely a Target addict and I'm so glad this location is very close to my job.
