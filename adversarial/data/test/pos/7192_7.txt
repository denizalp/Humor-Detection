I'll just jump straight to the food.\n\nRib lunch special http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w#UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w\nThe picture says it all, a large pile of seasoned fries with probably 3 of the better ribs I've had in town. There was a delicious, slightly crisp layer from the dry rub melting with some fat on the rib. There was another delicious layer from the slight pink smoke ring under that. I dont like to much smoke in BBQ. The meat was fall of the bone but firm enough to my liking. I added a little of their spicy sauce just to try the sauce but it really didn't need it it was made right. I wish I had more of the rib but occasionally they run out.\n\nNachos http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w#RAXIeZU1KTHVAqPPv3R84w\nA huge pile of what seemed and tasted like the packaged nacho chips, some good pulled pork and your typical nacho ingredients olives, jalapeno peppers, sour cream, cheese, etc. Not a big fan probably because of the chips but it was a huge nacho and it was decent. \n\nCincinnati Chili Cheese Fries http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ#GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ\nA very delicious chili filled with lots of meat with oozing cheese covering a pile of fries. It was a side dish but large enough to be a meal by itself. This and the ribs were my favorite items here.\n\nHot Link Sandwich http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ#gvXrXCOe4P73HGcFFq_OWQ They were out of the usual bun so they split the links and put them between a couple of Texas Toast, which I actually  preferred over the bun. It wasn't that bad, a little dry but I enjoyed it more than the nachos.\n\nBrisket. A lot like the ribs delicious outer layer from the rub and fat, another good smoke ring but kind of dry with not a lot of flavor towards the center. I've had a lot better briskets but it was good enough.\n\nService for some reason has always been slow. It's BBQ shouldn't it already be finish and ready to go before we get there? Cut my pieces off and give me my BBQ already. Busy or not it seems like it always takes the same amount of time to get in and out. Their lunch specials are a lot cheaper than dinner, dinner prices aren't cheap. The ribs and Cincinnati Chili Cheese Fries were 5's. Everything else was maybe a 3-4. Overall a 3.75 rating. For what it's worth I like Top Notch BBQ ribs a lot more than Rollin Smoke ribs.
