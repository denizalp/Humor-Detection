Carrabba's just flat out sucks.  Growing up north next to all good italian food, there were times where I will still stop in Carraba's.  It always felt like a step above chain restaurants and the food seemed to almost be on the level of a cheesecake factory.  Not so much anymore.  I rather go to Chile's than eat this mess again.  We started with the mixto appetizer ( i know that is not the name ) with the calamari, bruschetta, and mozzie stix.  This was the only thing decent other than the 1 Beer and 1 wine we had.  For the entrees we had the frozen lobster ravioli and the filet covered in goat cheese.  There was more goat cheese than steak and the steak was pretty rare.  Normally I would be all about this, but for such a shitty cut of meat the only thing saving this thing was the goat cheese.  When i recieved my bill for $93 after feeling like my food was  a step below applebee's I wish i had gone somewhere else like Mama Ricottas where I would get 100xs better food and even at a cheaper rate.  Carrabba's what happened to you?  I used to love you and now I know to just 500 ft away like I have a restraining order against you.
