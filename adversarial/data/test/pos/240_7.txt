Delaney (hair stylist) and Bree (makeup artist) were incredible.  Showed up on time, extremely professional and all the girls in my wedding party plus my mom were absolutely gorgeous.  The hairdos and makeup held up throughout the ceremony and well into the night.  They accommodated every girls' personal tastes...heavy makeup on my glam friend, light natural makeup on my tomboy sis.  Everyone was happy.\n\nI wish I had done my hair\/makeup with Amelia C, but bridal hair\/makeup came with my pre-paid high-end Vegas hotel wedding ceremony package.  My BFF who is super picky\/meticulous about her makeup said that she had never been happy with any makeup artist until now.  She demanded to know where I found Amelia C.  It's all thanks to you, fellow Yelpers!\n\nI would highly recommend Amelia C to anyone getting married in a Vegas destination wedding.  Rest assured that they will get it right.\n\nBTW -- all my girls are Asian and did not have poor experiences (as mentioned in a previous review).
