:: ROOM REVIEW ONLY (KING BED) ::\n\nWe chose our stay at Bally's for our past weekend trip due to a pretty good Groupon deal. Room rates: weekend @  $79 & weekday @ $35.\n\nWe check-ed in after 7PM on a Friday night and the line was minimal. Our front-desk gal was friendly and we requested for the highest floor possible in the renovated Jubilee Tower. She gave us floor 65 :)  Our room view faced Caesars Palace, Bellagio, Flamingo, Drais, & LinQ.\n\nThe room was spacious. The bed did not disappoint. We napped for hours on Sat night & missed out on clubbing! :\\  The bathroom was clean & comfortable.  Definitely call Housekeeping for a humidifier (generally available) for it'll really help with the dry air!\n\nWhat I've noticed this time around that I didn't before was when you open the room lights it does take a little time to warm up & then it really lights up the room. At 1st, we were like the room looks so dim & thought it was for romantic room purposes :P\n\n\n:: NOTES ::\n\n1) Fridge is hidden in the dresser below the TV. You need to turn it on to get it working. Fridge does not come stocked with goodies. So it's great to bring your own & fill it up.\n\n2) Bathroom amenities were minimal: 1 bath bar, 1 face bar, 1 shampoo\/conditioner & 1 lotion\n\n3) Each day could be a different housekeeper cleaning your room -- so we tipped house keeping couple of dollars per day of our stay there. \n\n4) Valeting the car was much easier & quicker than self-parking. Not much wait time either (at most 10 min) when we went this past weekend. \n\n5) We didn't bother checking out at the front desk nor through the TV nor online. We just left our keys in the room & headed home. A day later I received my invoice via email.
