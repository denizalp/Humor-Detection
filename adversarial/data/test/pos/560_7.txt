Came into town to see a friend and visited this place just to see if all of the rumors were true. I didn't see Amy, but I heard her. Sammy seemed nice. \n\nThe food was absolutely horrible. Frozen, undercooked. But I was smart enough to not mention it to the owners. \n\nMy opinion? Get fresh ingredients and take customers' opinions to heart. They only have your benefit in mind. Work on the cooking or just stick to baking.
