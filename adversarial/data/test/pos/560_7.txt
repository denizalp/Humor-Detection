Too See Roll is definitely my go-to place for my poke cravings. Three days after they opened, I was definitely hooked to the point where I would go there every week or even almost 7 days straight lol (amusingly enough one of my friends actually did that haha). \n\nAt the entrance you'll see two glowing air diffusers with aromas of ginger if you smell closely enough. I thought that was an interesting touch and liked the idea of having a diffuser or humidifier around so I actually tried to google and find the exact ones for my personal use lol! The ambiance was very 'asianesque' - with shiny wooden tables and benches. You can get various intricately packaged sushi\/bento to-go on the left hand side of the restaurant as well as Japanese snacks such as pocky, soft drinks, jello, etc. \n\nI would come here sometimes after my graveyard shift and would be greeted by the owner, Bruce, with friendly smiles to start the morning. I liked how he would actually be in the forefront on scene and interact with customers as well as so some labor such as rearranging the tables and chairs - it gave me the impression that he actually cares about customer service and giving a positive perception, which is a nice touch because its rare to see this at most restaurants in Vegas. Charlie the chef as well would greet us from behind the counter with friendly chatter so it was nice being welcomed by enthusiastic and sociable employees. \n\nMy typical order here would be: Large, mixed greens, crab salad + cucumber, yuzu+sesame sauce+green onion, cajun albacore+salmon+super white tuna+spicy tuna+yellowtail, masago,bean sprouts,extra avo, yellow radish, seaweed, furikake, and finishing touches of drizzled spicy mayo with said mayo on the side. The yuzu and sesame sauces complimented well as it was neither too sweet nor too salty. There was a time that they would run out of yuzu sauce I was recommended to try the house sauce+sesame combo as it was close to the same thing, and it was, just less sweet. \n\nAs a side note, their black rice is definitely filling as it was warm and moist but it did lack flavor at the bottom so I would think that adding rice seasoning would do it better (they do offer that option too) prior to choosing your proteins. \n\nIf I had the choice and time though, I would come here every day til I get sick of it. Its the closest thing to California's PokiNometry, so I'm rather overzealous about this haha!! :D
