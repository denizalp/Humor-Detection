my favorite rave of all time !! what more can you ask for when they place a huge massive in the peak of summer, warm weather, beautiful people, good music, and best of all FREE Carnival rides ! it's like a big kids dream come true ! (by big kids I mean 18+ only please). Never failed to have fun here, there is always has a huge line-up of great DJs, 2 days of non-stop fun, day to night!\n\nyou just know you're having a great time when you never want the night to end, and when the last DJ closes everyone chants \"ONE MORE SONG\" :)
