Sweet Delights for sure!  If you are a brownie lover and want to try to find your favorite go to Lady Dianes and check them out. Their Peanut Butter  Chocolate Brownies are so good I want to slap my mother!  \n\nRight now Lady Dianes Bakery facing 19th avenue is  needing business because of the construction traffic\/ So this is a great time to take a delish treat to the office or to a friend  or just eat a goodie for yourself.  You will not be sorry.
