I love going grocery shopping. I love exploring.\n\nI have always been treated friendly there, whether it be by the meat department, cashiers, and there is a tattoo'd associate in the produce, who is always very friendly, and speaks to everyone he sees.\n\nTheir breads they make in store are delicious. The three cheese bread is my family's favorite. They are even starting to carry sushi, which are yummy as well. I also see that they carry some special items, like Cayman Jack and large single blue moon\/shock top beers (perfect for when I make beer battered fish\/onion rings)\n\nThe remodeled store is beautiful. But the parking lot is terrible, because Smith's is always, always bumpin'! \n\nAnd I love smith's because I save on gas at shell! Today, I saved .60 cents a gallon, and paid 2.91 for gas, and they give you that discount up to a dollar! They make it really easy for you to save money, especially now when you can load digital coupons onto your shoppers card online! I had a steal today on Kraft shredded cheese (making pizza tomorrow) it was on sale, and then I had an additional .50 cents off.\n\nThe only thing that I don't buy there is body products\/shampoos\/baby\/detergent.\nThat I save for Sally beauty supply, [in the same parking lot] or Target, or if I am feeling brave, Walmart. Because they are just too pricey.
