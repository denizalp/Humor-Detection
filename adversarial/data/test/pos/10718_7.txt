I went into the bar for my second time. I have never been so rudely approached. I walked in after work (I bartend) and a tall guy started screaming at me for going onto the back patio to smoke. I finished my first cocktail and my first game of pool and was violently screamed at. I asked the bartender if he knew the owner and he proceeded to tell me he was one of the owners and that guy was actually not on the clock. I can't imagine working in the industry and having an asshole ruin my entire business for me, but apparently this owner was okay with it. My friend and I even tried to go back the same night and that wasted guy was still there. I never post a negative review! I am now!!! I have never meant anything that I've said more than I do now. This guy is obviously a problem considering local bars around say they close just so they don't have to deal with him! As an employer, if I heard that every bar closed so they didn't have to deal with a dick employee...I wouldn't have him as an employee
