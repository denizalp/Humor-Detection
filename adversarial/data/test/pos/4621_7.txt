Cute funky diner that reminds me of a Florida diner I would take my dad. Lots of cute things on the wall and patriotic themed decor. Large plates of food. My breakfast of Cinnamon French Toast with Eggs and sausage was good. Nothing to write home about or die over but good.  Better than most diners in town but a bit pricier than a cheapy breakfast place. Nice servers. I would go back to try lunch.
