This is THE worst auto repair shop in Vegas-- PERIOD!! They completely caused a massive auto transmission leak in my brother's car when they changed the two front axles with the wrong sizes and they took utterly no responsibility for the damage.\n\nThey then told us both to get the 'f' out of there when we took the wrong axle back to the shop and had the worst, most arrogant attitudes I've ever seen coming from two incompetent idiots!\n\nThis shop used to be called 'Purrrfect Auto Service' a few years ago but changed their  name after they were filmed on camera committing fraud with one of their customers and were told to shut the place down completely.\n\nNEVER take your car to this dump--even for an oil change, or you will regret it!
