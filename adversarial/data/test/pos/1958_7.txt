I picked up some takeout here this evening.  I wondered if I had gone to a totally different restaurant than the 4 star Mint Thai I had visited several months ago.\n\nOn the one hand maybe they are having an off night.\n\nOn the other hand maybe they have dropped significantly in quality since my first dining experience.\n\nIf you would kindly lend me yet another hand, I have run across restaurants where the take out food is like a totally different restaurant.  Maybe Mint Thai is one of those places.\n\nThere is a trend down and to the right in the reviews...
