Don't come here! Place was horrible Started out great! They sent us a driver and she was awesome and recommended us to go to Sophie's. So we agreed and then We were refused entrance because we were a large group of women with one gentlemen. The bold head bouncer told our driver to take us somewhere else and we were not welcomed here. Place was a joke. Don't waist your time.
