Some days, you just can't decide if you want Taco Bell, or if you want to try something new, like Firehouse Subs.  \n\nOn those days, you let the fates decide:  Which one will we pass first, on the right side of the street?\n\nFirehouse won this weekend, and I am SO glad that it did!\n\nWe've been wanting to try Firehouse for ages, but always seem to forget that its around.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, and the service was super polite. \n\nThey don't have a huge menu, but all of the sandwiches looked great.  I decided to try The Engineer, which is turkey breast, mushrooms, and swiss cheese.  I ordered it \"Fully Involved\" (mayo, lettuce, mustard, onion, pickle, hold the tomato on mine please!)\n\nFella had the New York Steamer with corned beef, brisket, Pastrami, mustard and dressing, with veggies added. \n\nThey have a hot sauce bar, where you can take little to go containers of hot sauce home with  you.  \n\nThe drink machine is bad-ass, too, with a TON of different options, including cherry vanilla coke!  \n\nThe sandwiches were great.  My 8 inch was very filling.  I have every intention of coming here more often, and trying everything on the menu.
