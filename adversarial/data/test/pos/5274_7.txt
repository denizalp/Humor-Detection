Cool little shop to stop by and grab a few sweets if you're in the area. I've tried a few of Payard's sweets which are pretty good, and the Macarons are like Doritos...you can never just have one.\n\nAs Payard is a pastry legend, he can also hold his own on the savory side. I have yet to try some of his offerings, and sit down and dine there. Looks like a future Sunday Brunch spot soon!...ALOHA!!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(310\/365) \"Sweet & Savory\"
