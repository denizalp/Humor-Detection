Stopped in for a breakfast burrito.  I love them here.  Sometimes I get them smothered, sometimes not.  I love the crunchy potatoes in them.\n\nThey've added Santa Maria style barbecue.  I didn't try any of that.  Note: Santa Maria style barbecue is not barbecue.  It's really a style of grilling.  It popularized the tri-tip roast.  Hopefully, we'll give it a shot on my next visit to Vegas.\n\nGreat newer location with plenty of seating.
