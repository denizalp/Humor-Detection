Famine, earthquakes, typhoons. All three occurred at this establishment when I didn't get my food in under 30 minutes. The staff was nice but I got fake people showing fake love to me straight up to my face. \"Six cold like Alaska\" but Five Guys sent shivers down my spine with their ineptitude. I felt betrayed like Benedict Arnold or even Judas. What happened to me I wouldn't wish to happen on Satan himself. In my nightmares I see a world of clowns kidnapping puppies and forcing them to eat food from the Five Guys on Providence Road. \n\nOverall I was very upset with the service of this place. They take so incredibly long to crank out an order. I remember coming here with my friends and their service was impeccable. Oh How the mighty have fallen. Also super disappointed in the drink machine not being very good either. Just an overall poor place to eat your food. Unless you want to wait 3 hours to get your food. 1\/10 would not recommend to a friend. Find another Five Guys but this one is about as valuable as the last poop I took in the toilet.
