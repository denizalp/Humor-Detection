3.5 stars\n\nIt's about time Markham gets a BBQ restaurant. Located just east of the Loblaw's \/ LCBO on Bullock. Lot's of parking in front of the restaurant and a good amount of seating inside. Lot's of people were stopping by for takeout. \n\nI visited during opening week so I Imagine they still have some kinks to work out. When we arrived, no one greeted us and we were not sure if we should sit ourselves or order at the cash first. After standing at the cash (and being ignored), we sat down. No one came to serve us at the table either. I finally got someones attention and asked how we place an order. They apologized and said they didn't see us.     \n\nI only raise this point as I hope they use the feedback to improve since their food is amazing and I want this place to be a success (so I can keep coming back). Once we finally placed our order, the service was great.\n\nWe tried the Elvis combo (mixed platter) and the Brisket sandwich. The ribs were excellent with lot's of meat and smoked perfectly. The pulled pork and beef brisket were also very good -   great smokey \/ tangy flavour. The cole slaw made for a good side and the baked beans were a standout for me - love the chunks of pork in there. Fries were average at best but who cares - this place is about the BBQ.\n\nPrices are on the low end for what you get... both quantity and quality. You can get a large delicious meal for about $10. \n\nI will return again when the next BBQ craving kicks in. All the kinks should be worked out by then.\n\nBK
