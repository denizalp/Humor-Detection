3.5 stars \n\nI'm glad I didn't read Westgate's reviews or looked at their Yelp pics before checking in; I would've ran in the opposite direction, but thankfully, my group didn't experience any of the negatives documented on Yelp (except for a poor wipe down on the surfaces in the room my companion booked.) \n\nSome rooms are renovated, others are not. I stayed in both types of rooms, and honestly, they were equally modern looking, clean, & acceptable for a second stay. The un-renovated room was more spacious, but there was a weird, gargling sound in the bathroom sink. \n\nFriendly staff; someone even walked us up to our room to make sure everything was in order & to our liking. \n\nAn a-ok stay, but probably would not book this hotel again because: food options are horrendous from what I could see, parking is across the street rather than in the same building (yes, I'm lazy, especially in 107-degree heat!), & apparently this hotel attracts some thuggy-ass patrons. My friend said she didn't feel safe playing in the casino solo at 3am.
