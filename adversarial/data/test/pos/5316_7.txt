I got a \"locals\" offer for a shows.  Two tickets for $99.  When I signed up the tickets are really $65 each - not $50.  The difference is taxes and fees - (mostly fees).  PLEASE just advertise the true cost.  When the ticket is actually 30% higher than the offer, that's false advertising.  AND there's no phone number of contact information so one can call and get explanations.\n\nI thought casinos were suppose to have good customer service?????
