I was looking for a cocktail dress and I remembered always passing by this store with wedding dresses in the window so I thought I'd check it out.  They have a great selection of gorgeous dresses and gowns.  My mom and I were there for about an hour, trying on dresses and deciding which one to buy.  Seriously, each dress was more beautiful than the last and I just wanted to buy all of them but I only need one.  I was so surprised that we both found things we loved in a store called \"Group USA\" at the Mills mall.  \n\nWe were there for a total of 45 minutes before we ever saw a sales rep.  Which is fine by me, I don't like to be bothered when I'm shopping.  She was very nice when ringing us up.  The items were reasonably priced, I came in wayyyy under my budget of what I planned on spending for my dress.  My mom went nuts and bought a few cute tops and bottoms along with her dress, she was also under budget.    \n\nI knocked off a star because the dressing room area could use some cleaning and a fresh coat of paint.  Also, even though I didn't mind being haggled by the sales lady, a nice warm welcome into the store is always appreciated.
