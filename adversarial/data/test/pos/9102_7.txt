Tried this place today for lunch and it was empty except for 1 table. The menu is quite extensive so I asked the manager for a recommendation.  He recommended the cheesesteak and said it was the \"best\" sandwich ever. I place my order and it took 15 mins before I got my sandwich. Not sure why it took so long as there was no one who ordered before I did.  \n\nThe sandwich itself was bland, the cheese was not melted, and the meat itself was a grey, unappetizing color. At a cost of over $12 including tax, the value was definitely not there.  I don't mind paying that amount for a \"gourmet\" sandwich if it was worth it, but this one was subpar at best.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone as there are better options near by.
