Went in to order a single loaf of bread. Thr cashier wasn't able to slice the bread for me - that's fine, someone else here can. Apparently not, I was told that they have presliced loaves for making sandwiches and that they'll just give me one of those - okay, I'd rather have the loaf on the shelf I can watch them slice, but fine.\n\nThe loaf is thin sliced, and I want it thick sliced. Their response is to assure me that the bread slicers only do thin. I responded with no, I watched someone last time I ordered a loaf slice it thick. \n\nSomeone who has actually been trained to use the machine (shouldn't all of age employees be able to use this??) slices the bread for me, then disappears to the back with it. I assume he's just bagging it for me. \n\nHe is not, in fact. I am told that he took a slice to make a half sandwich, and is this okay? Um NO I paid for the whole loaf, not for someone else's sandwich... I express this, and the man helping me rolls his eyes and walks to the back and returns with the bread I have already paid for, with two slices cut in half!\n\nA 15 minute ordeal for a single, thick sliced loaf of sourdough that had been molested. Absolutely ridiculous.
