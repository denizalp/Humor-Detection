I have been suggesting that Bachi Burger open a second location in the SW since my first visit to the original location.  So when I found reviews on the new, and much closer, second location on W. Sahara, I was happy just like a lot of other Yelpers living in the vicinity.  So when fellow foodies suggested we meetup and give this Bachi Burger a try, it was a no brainer for me.\n\nPerhaps in keeping with the theme of being bigger and better, the Summerlin location sports a larger dining room, as well as, a more extensive menu. The menu now spans four pages, instead of the original two sided menu, and looks great in their silver color menu cover.  Milkshakes, sake sangria, fried calamari, and Grilled Loche Duarte Salmon Burger are just some of the new items that are new additions to the Bachi lineup.\n\nThe hostess and our waitress were impressively knowledgeable about the menu, and did not hesitate to demonstrate their Jason Bourne-like photographic memory recall talent.  On a side note, how come \"Insert country\" Got Talent never showcase individuals that can recall the value of Pi?  Maybe that was part of the reason she knew who ordered what and checked on our table regularly.\n\nOkay, moving on to the good stuff. This is a burger joint, with a lot of beefy burgers and other alternatives.  I however have always thought that their seafood burger lineup were better than their Angus or Wagyu fusion burgers.  Therefore, I opted to try their Grilled Loch Duarte Salmon burger, which I was told was only available at the Summerlin location.  I was not disappointed with my decision to order this burger. It was made with grilled smoked salmon from Scotland, with crunchy bacon, plus tomato, red onions and arugula to keep it healthy, and lemon herb mayo and ponzu vinaigrette for flavor, moistness (sounds inappropriate) and that \"if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\" and ability to moisturize your sticky fingers leaving them smelling like fish for the remainder of your delicious meal.  Sticky and odorous fingers aside, it is highly recommended by yours truly.\n\nMy dining companions ordered the Mr. Ho's Burger (comes stock with meaty Chinese Sausages just for the ladies), Spicy Miso Burger (personallyI think it sounds moreinteresting calling it Mi So Spicy! Burger) and the Ronin Burger, and all seem satisfied with their menu selection.  So the consensus is that the food we ordered were yummy.  But I am in the camp that felt for a $10-$20+ burger price tag, you should be able to walk out satisfied, not wonder over to Archi's or Jollibee or drive over to Anime Ramen for dinner part 2.  Just sayin'\n\nDecor\/Ambiance:  4\/5  Felt more upscale, even without the dim lighting.\n\nFood:  4.5\/5  NoM nOm noM Nom!\n\nService:  4.5\/5  Good!\n\nPrice\/Value:  3\/5  Tab could add up fast if you have high metabolism, eat like a growing teenager or on the LV No Buffet List for threatening the profitability of buffets and other AYCE establishments (you know who you are)\n\nParking:  4\/5  Better odds of landing a decent parking space here than hooking up with one of the Anime Ramen girls (already factored in enticing them with Panda Pocky).\n\n4 stars.
