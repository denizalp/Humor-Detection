The attitude of the deliverers is one to note.\nTips are given based on the customer's capability to spend and want.\nTo that note, I'm a college student and I certainly do not have money to be thrown around.\nEven when dining (rarely) at expensive places, I keep tips to a minimum, as it is not my duty to pay the waiters\/waitresses. If the bill reflects the service charge and we're told beforehand, I'll be perfectly willing to shell out the buck, through an informed decision, reflected in the bill.\n\nSo when the minute bill, from Ramen Bar was followed by a delivery boy asking for a tip and then telling me I should go to the restaurant and pickup the food myself, because he doesn't want to drive far (2miles) without a tip, I'm probably never gonna order from this place again, let alone dine in. \nAs well as another situation, in which the delivery person asked me to pay for the gas for the car through tips for the delivery, however, the person was more respectful, so I let that slide.\nHowever, when I was told I should go to the restaurant myself, I was done.\n\nRamen bar, please pay your delivery staff properly, so that they don't come begging to the customers for their wage and transport.
