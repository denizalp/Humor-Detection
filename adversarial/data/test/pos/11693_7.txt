Went to see Vegas the Show at this theatre. The show itself was fun & entertaining. \n\nThe fact that my friend and I had a few drinks before the show made finding the theater more difficult than it needed to be.. We asked a few people and eventually hobbled our way to the theater entrance. \n\nHowever the staff was friendly, and they kept the drinks flowing. The venue is small compared to what I'm use to but all the better because we're so close to the stage. \n\nThe only complaint was that the bathroom was 3 floors down by the use of stairs. It was a little bit annoying to say the least.
