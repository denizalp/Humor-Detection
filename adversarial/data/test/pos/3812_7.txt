This is one of the better Goodlife locations in the city. It's spacious and there is plenty of machines to use. The classrooms are a nice size, and the best part: it's 24 hours during the week (closes at 8pm Saturday and Sunday) \n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Space. There is plenty of space to go around, especially during off hours. \n2. Equipment. Again, there is plenty of equipment in this gym and its up to date and I've never seen any broken. \n3. Staff. This differs from other locations in that staff are actually pleasant here. Lots of gyms have terrible customer service but this is not one of them. \n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. Busy. This place gets extremely busy during the week in the peak hours (lunch time and after work). This is especially true for classes. You need to be here early to get a space.\n\nRecommendation: go during off hours. You don't want to gain wait!
