Nom Nom Burger... I liked the name.  \n\nApparently, Twinsie did, too, because she got one, also!  (And she let me taste her Peanut butter Stout!)\n\nI sure appreciated the complimentary bucket of savory flavored popcorn - that was a nice touch!\n\nWe shared a Caesar salad, but I stopped eating it after a couple of bites because it was spicy with maybe some white pepper?  \n\nThe Nom Nom burger had some cheese and crunchy potato chips in it. I added some ketchup for more flavor...haha!  It came with fries...maybe we should have gotten the Onion Rings instead... (note to self).  I would have eaten more fries (with ketchup), but I was distracted from the food because I was trying to listen to our conversation. \n\nIt's a fun, loud, busy place on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel on The Strip of Las Vegas. We enjoyed the cute cow themed cartoons and especially the cow wearing a Vegas Golden Knights cape!  Next time, we should get one of the milk shakes (they told me it's infused with alcohol)!  \n\nThanks to Craig, Matt, and Joyce for a fun dinner!
