It was my birthday and I really wanted to try something we haven't been to before.This is another establishment I have heard about for awhile. So I packed up the girls and headed north bound on the 303.\nWe arrived there around 4:30, just before the dinner rush. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waiter took our drink order very quickly and took our order. Since we never been there before we asked what he recommended for dinner, so he gave us a few ideas.\nI ordered the fried chicken,\nIt was smothered with their gravy on top w\/the chicken on their mashed potatoes, this dish also came with some vegi's. I really enjoyed the chicken, it was cooked with some good spices and it was not dried. Potatoes still had their peelings but thats the way I like it. Now their vegi's had a mixture of peas, squash, zucchini, broccoli, and carrots. I am not a peas person so I didn't even touch that. Their carrots were amazing, I would order the vegetables just for the carrots. Since I like chili, I had to order their mama's chili. This chili is great, might be a little spicy to some. But it has an amazing taste.\nWife had their gringo burger and she loved it, gave me a bite and it was really good. \nThe girls had the burger, and chicken tenders. Seemed they both really enjoyed their meals.\nWe had a great time! Food was great, service was great, and the atmosphere was great. We will diffidently come back again.
