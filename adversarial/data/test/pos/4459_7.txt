As authentic as it gets! This newly opened little stall serves authentic Chinese crêpes from Northern China and egg waffles & ice-cream Hong Kong style.\n\nI tried the Chinese Crêpe and can say that it's 100% authentic, from the ingredients to the way it's made. The basic crepe is made with a blend of white and bean flour and garnished with one egg, a fried crispy dough and spring onions and cilantro. You can upgrade your crepe by adding extra toppings at a modest price.
