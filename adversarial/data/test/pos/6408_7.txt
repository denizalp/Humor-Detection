On 11\/21\/15 \nI've been coming here for 10 years and today first time ever has one of your employees degraded me in front of others and my children. Anyhow.I'm currently sitting in a theater listening not even watching peanuts movie at your palms location crying of embarrassment due to one of your workers with black frames glasses yelling at me in front of everyone. I had a empty cup of coffee I was going to dispose of in the trash. Then this guy starts yelling at me walking all aggressively towards me and my two little boys \"mamm mam you need to dispose of that\" (I would of understood if it was full or maybe alcoholic drink) all while my hands are literally inside of one of your trash bins, throwing the empty cup of coffee. I told him what does it look like I'm doing with my hands? Or would you like for me to throws it on the floor? Hime- \" I don't care what you do you need to put it down now, or we can clean it\" yelling at me in front of my kids and scarring them. I'm not even enjoying the movie which is playing as I Wright this horrible experience and traumatic day for my kids. Worst customer service ever. After coming her so long I get disrespectful accusations of what smuggling an empty cup with a hole. This is ridicules and disappointed that we can't even enjoy the movie as we sit her while it plays
