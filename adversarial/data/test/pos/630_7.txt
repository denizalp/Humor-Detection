Oh yay! I still love Monta! I've been back three times since my first review. Tonight was the first time I tried the Miso Ramen. Let me tell you, it was delicious! The noodles were actually ramen and the soup was a lil sweet. It was definitely not a disappointment at all. I can't wait for the winter, when its ramen eating weather! However, there was a weird smell inside but other than that the food was still awesome.
