We are lucky to have this nearly year round, from early Spring to late Fall (Winter farmer's market exists!).\n\nYou can find anything here, fresh-cut flowers, kimchi, griddle-cooked cheese, pastries, and pastas, the list is endless. I know my prices and the farmer's market isn't outrageous compared to Woodman's prices. Plus, you know that the vegetables are coming from local (and not so local - Door County Cherries?!) area farms.\n\nI like to go early or later for a more tame crowd, but on a gorgeous Autumn day, it's hard to have that type of luxury.\n\nFriends and family that visit from near and far always tell me they want to visit the Dane Co Farmer's Market! They've read it somewhere or have heard it in passing on how great it is.\n\nMake a day of it! Come in the morning and scope out the produce, have lunch on or off State Street and catch some good end-of-the-day specials on your way out!
