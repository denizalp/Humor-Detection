We came here on a Monday night, 30min before closing, to order a concrete brownie for $5.50. \n\n- We really got lost trying to find this place. On the iPhone, it said that it was next to Red Mango. We called them. They're by Cafe Rio and Grimaldi's. #drivingfail. \n- Great ambiance. Random antiques. Ice cream parlor music. No Top Hits, Hip-Hop, Rap. \"Thank you for being a custardmer!\" LOL. Good one. \n- Lots of seating. Comfortable. \n- Reminds me of a McDonald's McFlurry, but WAY creamier. \n- The brownie was great, but for $5.50, needed more topping, considering for $5.50 something like Cold Stone. \n- Less butterfat than ice cream.\n- I thought they'd have Italian Ice here. Aw...\n- We left with our mouth so sweet, that we needed something salty to balance! In-N-Out Fries nearby! Phew....
