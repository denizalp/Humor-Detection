This one was ooooooo k as far as Carl's Jr. goes. Staff was friendly and was greeted the second I walked in the door. Order was taken immediately, Food arrived promptly. I enjoyed my #6  Double Western Bacon Cheese Burger meal with Criss-Cut fries, and washed it all down with delicious Strawberry soda. I only give it 3 stars because its a little small inside, so its kinda cramped while eating.
