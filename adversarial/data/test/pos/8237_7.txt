Today is my second day in row coming here for breakfast. Yesterday, I ordered the Nami McBagel Breakfast Sandwich and the Matcha Green Tea Latte. The breakfast sandwich was crazy good! I'm not a vegan so I was a little skeptical of the tofu egg, \"bacon\" and \"cheese\", but it was absolutely delicious! There is also a sauce that is a little spicy which completes this sandwich. I also love that they use real matcha as many places don't and I can get  it unsweetened, which a lot of people think is crazy.\n\nThe only downfall is the cost. It's $16.83 for a breakfast sandwich and latte. To me, that's a bit expensive. This is a place I'll come back to splurge every now and again, though. The food and I cannot forget the service is that good!\n\nHighly recommend!
