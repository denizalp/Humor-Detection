Absolutely horrible food.  Not sure why people are saying it's ok.  My dinner partner ordered the steak sandwich, it came wrapped in a tortilla shell (?), it was soggy and sitting in some sort of liquid that was tasteless, the steak was over cooked and chewy.  I ordered the brisket - which tasted like it came out of a pre-packaged box.  When we could finally get a waitresses attention and asked for the bill with our food uneaten, she wanted to know if we would like to take it home.  We were stunned, any good restaurant will ask you if there's something wrong with the food.  We didn't think it was even worth complaining.  We'll just never go back.
