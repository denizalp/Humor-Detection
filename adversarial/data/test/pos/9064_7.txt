I hate to write this review, because the staff was really nice, but the sign on the wall stating that massage therapy is not regulated by the State of Arizona should have been a warning. \n\nI got the therapeutic massage (aka deep tissue). I was left with bruises. And I have had many a deep tissue in my time. Further, the massage therapist hadn't trimmed her nails and her strokes were fast and all over the place (not in a good way). The room was too cold and when I mentioned it I was told that they have to keep it that way because it is just so hot outside. Umm ok.\n\nIt was also strange to go to a spa with no relaxation area or steam room. It was more like a salon with massage rooms attached.\n\nJust not my cup of tea. I do encourage others to ask for a licensed massage therapist before booking their treatments.
