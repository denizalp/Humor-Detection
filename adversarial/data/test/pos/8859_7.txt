I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN.\n1 radio tuner nob was missing from the console , the mileage counter no longer functions , the battery had as well been fiddled with and the radio wasn't working properly. The vehicle was dropped of yesterday and to our knowledge was not worked on. The following day (today) we drove the vehicle to find that there are several things wrong. While there the mechanic several times kept trying to separate my mom and me so he could try to muscle her for more money. They are thieves and liars and I believe there aren't more bad reviews of this business because the majority of their clientele aren't familiar with sites like yelp. DO NOT GO HERE YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF.
