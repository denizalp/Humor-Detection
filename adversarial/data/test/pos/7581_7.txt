A. Quite possibly, the most beautiful bakery in Toronto. When you walk in, stop just inside the door and take in the view. You will get the surreal feeling of having stepped inside the pages of a lavishly illustrated storybook. Literally breathtaking as the aroma of sweet baked goods is heavenly.\n\nB. I won't even begin to review in detail the taste of the baked goods I tried - sticky caramel butter tarts; gooey crumbly date squares; chewy-moist, rich chocolate brownies; shortbread filled with lemon curd.  Everything tastes as wonderful as it looks. Refer to A. \n\nC. Friendly service. Reasonably-priced decadence. Pretty packaging suitable for presenting as a hostess gift or sweet surprise. Ample parking nearby. \n\nHighly recommended!
