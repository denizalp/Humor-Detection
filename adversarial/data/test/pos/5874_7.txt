I was more than a little concerned when we were seated and I overheard a neighboring table complain about how they had been here for 45 minutes and had yet to get their food, but I was pleasantly surprised when our server, food, and drinks all arrived without delay as we were on our lunch hour. I ordered the Oriental Salad with Macadamia Crusted Chicken. It was delightful! The portion size was more than ample and each bite was an explosion of flavor. Nothing short of heaven! I highly recommend it.
