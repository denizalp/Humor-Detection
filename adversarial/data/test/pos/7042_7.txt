I'm a stickler when it comes to people getting creative with pho. \n\nPho burrito? No thanks.\nInstant pho? Ew. \nPho fries? Nice try.\n\nSo as you can believe, I was not really interested in trying a lobster pho. But I gave in to the hype one day and wow. This is really as amazing as they say. This broth is freakin divine. We decided to get the Surf & Turf Pho (~$30) since it was a LOT cheaper than the $50 Maine Lobster Pho, and our server told us that they were practically the same except the Surf & Turf came with rare steak. I don't even like lobster THAT much, and now I'm a lobster pho convert. It's still so pricey, but I really do think this is worth the $. I think the only problem with it is that there wasn't enough of it. It's served in a deep dish that looks huge, but wasn't enough for two to share. It would be an average amount of food for one person. And lemme also just point out that the restaurant itself is really clean, trendy, and the beer was great.\n\nHighly recommend if you're out in Vegas and trying to treat yo self.
