I feel bad, this will be my first \"one star\" rating for any business. I so wanted to like this place since it is the closest Mexican restaurant to my house. I have been here about three times before I started Yelping and each time the food quality seemed to get worse.... \n\nFirst, this is your typical strip mall chain Mexi joint. They come to your table quick with water and chips (that was the only bright spot). The salsa came and it tasted and looked like watered down ketchup with a fleck or two of pepper seeds in it to give it the appearance of salsa - must have came from a large drum of pre-over-processed salsa rejects. My idea of salsa is fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapenos, etc where I can see and know what I am eating. THIS CRAP WAS GROSS! \n\nMy food arrived - I think we all have ordered the \"3 enchiladas\" plate from any of our Mexican favorites. Mine was covered, well avalanched with ice burg lettuce, cold runny sour cream and unmelted cheese. I wanted to ask for a small shovel to find my 3 enchiladas covered up on the bottom. Anyway, i got to them and the chicken was ice cold and gross, one bite - done with that one....I thought, hmmm, melted cheese enchilada....wrong - cut into that and all the cheese was still unmelted - WTF! The beef enchilada was ok and it warranted two bites, but had no flavor. \n\nTrying to keep this short - but overall, food SUCKED and I will not go back even on someone else's dime! \n\nsee my pics from this trip....
