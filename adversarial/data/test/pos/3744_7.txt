I did not gamble here.\nI did not eat at a buffet here.\nI did not shop here.\n\nBut I did eat at N9NE, which was great and in a separate review, and I did attend a party at the Sky Villa and was very impressed with the place.\nIt was a 9000+ sqft penthouse with amazing views of the city. The freaking shower had an amazing view.  The giant sunken tub fit two people comfortably and was surrounded by heavy ball chain that turned out to be a rather nifty effect.\nIn another bathroom, the faucet to the bathtub was an obscure hole in the ceiling, it was totally weird.\nThe main bedroom had a rotating circular bed. Somewhere out there is a photo of a six person spoon on the bed and I'm one of them.\nThere was a sauna upstairs, and a huge ass jacuzzi out on the balcony.\nThe tv room had three large flat screens.\nThe party had three bars. Standard drinks bar, sushi bar, and cheesecake dessert bar.  \nFinally, a grand piano in the center room, elevated above a sunken pond with a wall of cascading water nearby. The host of the party played the piano and we could croon along as we saw fit.\n\nThe room apparently rents for $40,000\/night, but rumor has it the party acquired the space for half price, a mere $20K. Day-um.\n\nToo bad my camera is broken.
