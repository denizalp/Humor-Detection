My OBGYN does not have ultrasound equipment in office, so I was sent to this office for my very first ultrasound. \nThis is my first pregnancy, and naturally I'm nervous, so I brought my husband. I even told the girl I booked my appointment with that I was bringing my husband. The girl told me to I needed a full bladder, and to drink about \"20oz of water\" \n\nWe arrived at the appointment, me being an over-achiever, drank 32oz of water, and I was excited to see the first flickering image of my child-to-be. \nWe were called back shortly, and the woman said, \n\n\"He can't come back here. Only you.\"\n\nWhen I asked why she said, \n\n\"I have the right to only allow the patient, since guests ask too many questions\" \n\nI am not an idiot. I understand she is a tech, and not a doctor, she isn't allow to confirm diagnosis, or give ANY details but disallowing my husband in the room was unnerving.  \nI imagine this woman might have been hardened by people asking her too many questions, but never have I encountered a colder human being.  \n\nTurns out I should have drank the water an hour in advance, no one told me this. She reprimanded me, and said, \"More than likely I won't be able to see anything\" \nI laid down, and was watching the screen, when she noticed I was watching the screen, she moved it away from my view. \n\nI tried to make conversation since I was literately shaking with nerves, and she gave me blunt, single word answers.  The worst part is she made some of the most horrific faces as she was doing my ultrasound. For someone who \"can't tell me anything...\" her face made me ever more anxious and terrified. She did nothing to calm my nerves. I tried several times to make conversation, or just be talked to ... but she wouldn't. \nThis woman destroyed what should have been an amazing experience with my husband. I cried for a very long time afterwards.  Why is being a decent human so rare these days?
