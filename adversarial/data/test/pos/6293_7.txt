Our visit sounded more like a visit to the Emergency Room.  There was plenty of sneezing, wheezing, itching, and overall difficulty breathing.\n\nThe cause:  a clueless couple and their hairy cat.\n\nA supervisor was called and we were told that we could leave the area but that a paying customer would not be asked to leave even if their cat was having a negative impact on other guests and employees.  Pets are allowed.\n\nPersonally, If I knew that I had an item that was causing that much distress, I would leave but I am of a different generation and it is not always about me.\n\nSo United ~ if I could give you negative stars, to risk the well being of that many people, I would.
