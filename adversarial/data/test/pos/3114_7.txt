I`ve been here for a couple times. It`s a beautiful place with classy atmosphere and delicious food. The servers are amazing, they are in suits and bow ties, cool guys with smiley faces and the service is pretty good.lol\nHere I had one of the best crab legs and stone crabs. The banana cream pie is unforgettable. The food is perfectly prepared. The stuff is really well trained and the food comes out quick. I think the food is a little overpriced, though it is Vegas and maybe the price is norm.  Definitely it`s a great choice for the people that want a good seafood place near Caesars.
