A friend took me here as a surprise for my birthday. He refused to tell me where he was taking me and I was really worried he'd take me somewhere I've already been to. He said he already knew what we were going to order when he was planning the surprise. We parked at an empty lot close to my church and I was scared. It's not the Wynn or Encore but a hotel I've never seen or heard of. What is this place?\n\nWe walked into the restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. It was classier and more intimate than I had anticipated.  Whew! The decor was very old Vegas. We got a booth...it was nice, plush and comfy. The service was great and our server was very attentive.\n\nWe started the evening with white sangria and a Honey Badger (muddled strawberries, club soda, lemon, honey Bourbon). I really enjoyed the Honey Badger. We got a complimentary veggie plate and bread. For our appetizer, we got the Pan-seared Foie Gras which is on top of peach cobbler with pecans and creme anglaise. The sweet yet tangy peach cobbler cuts down the richness of the foie gras - a nice contrast of flavor and texture. I got a medium rare filet mignon, my friend got a medium rare ribeye. To accompany our steaks, we got the Lobster Mac n Cheese, Cream Corn with Lobster. The steaks were simple and cooked to perfection. They know how medium rare is supposed to be. Pink, juicy and tender. The Lobster Mac and cheese and the cream corn with lobster were ok but definitely lacked lobster. You can count the small bits of lobster.\n\nWe were so full to even order dessert. But since it was my birthday, they gave me free dessert anyway. One was a lemon olive oil sorbet and the other was apricot sorbet. Fresh tasting and refreshing but we just couldn't finish them. We had to get a double shot of espresso to keep us awake. Then a plate of macarons came: raspberry and pistachio. They were good and had perfect shell and feet. It was a great evening!
