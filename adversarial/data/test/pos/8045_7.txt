I'm not afraid to give this place a review, especially after having such a fantastic experience!\n\nNot only do they have a wide variety of products in various colors and sizes, the employees are great too!\n\nThe staff are very knowledgeable and so sweet. The first time I stopped by it was on a whim, but I liked something I saw there so much that I asked to have it held. Normally, they only hold things for a few days, but they made an exception for me.  I came back and picked it up no problem! The employee even recognized me before I said what I was there for! \n\nI highly recommend Lolita's Boutique. They make you feel so good about yourself! A++
