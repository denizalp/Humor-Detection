I collect old video game systems, and as you can guess, they're not as easy to come by these days.\n\nLike an idiot, I followed a DIY (Do It Yourself) that I found online to clean the screen of an Atari Lynx, and it went bad.  It went really bad.\n\nTheir game repair is mostly in regards to the more current systems.  My 20+ year old system was out of their jurisdiction.  After admitting that they don't have the experience to work on such a piece, the owner paused for a moment, then asked me to bring it in anyway.  He would take a look at it.\n\nThe store itself is nice.  They have a ton of old gaming stuff, even if what I brought in was just on the cusp of what they didn't have.  But what they didn't have they tried anyway.  Let me reiterate that.  Even though my system wasn't in their realm of repair expertise, rather than turn me away, they made an effort to help me regardless.  That spoke volumes to me, and the repair job status become somewhat irrelevant (though I still wanted it fixed, mind you).\n\nAnd for their so-called \"lack of expertise\", they did a fine job anyway.  Mind you, I really made a mess of my attempted repair job, but the level that they attempted to restore it was worlds better than what I accomplished.  At any rate, they made it functional again, which was greatly appreciated.\n\nThe place is small, but they have some things that I haven't seen in years.  The staff gave me (admittedly deserved) flack for my botching my system, but it was good-natured, and I enjoyed talking with them as they worked on it.  The price was right, and more than fair as well.  I walked out very happy, and will frequent them again.\n\nFor a \"Mom 'N' Pop\", this place is a classy little find with a lot of heart.  It's nice to see that places like this still exist.
