I'm not a fan of Moxie's. Why? I'm not a fan of any restaurant that serves food and has low to no lighting. I feel like the darkness is that I don't see how bad the food is. Thankfully for Moxie's, I don't need to see it; I can just taste how bad it is. I've ordered their nachos and they were bland. I ordered a pasta dish and it was average. I've had dessert and even though the white chocolate brownie was okay, I've tasted better elsewhere. I've tried various items and just realized that aside from drinks, they will never be my first pick for going out to eat. There is only ONE item on the menu I like and that is the avocado spring rolls. So much so that the last time I went there, I asked for 2 orders of it as my main.\n\nThis one in particular is annoying because it's one of 2 restaurants in Yorkdale that is underground, so no to little cell service. It's hard to tell a person to meet you there and then get a table while you wait.\n\nSadly, certain friends of mine always seem to want to go here. That's fine--as long as they know that we'll all have to meet beforehand and walk over and that I will ALWAYS eat spring rolls when we go.
