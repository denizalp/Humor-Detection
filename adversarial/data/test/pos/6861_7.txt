\"Have you ever ate so much that your ribs and back hurts?\"\n\n\"No...\" a dirty look was thrown. \"Joyce, why are you like this!?\"\n\nInsert pointless maddening laughter and more rib-pain. Ouch.\n\nAs I shoveled another piece of some kind of dragon roll into my mouth, I began to wish that we stuck to only eating sashimi because dang, maki rolls had hella rice! The fish quality here is pretty great and at $23ish\/pp, you really can't beat that price. The yellowtail here is so buttery and delicious and the salmon was amazing. The knife cuts are a little thinner but are very uniformed. It's also fresh as you can still see the fish glistening under the lights. I also recommend trying the eggplant teriyaki. Most appetizers, sashimi, and nigiri can be ordered by 1-piece and the rolls comes with eight pieces. Don't end up over-ordering like me and my girlfriend. They also serve fried rice, stir-fried and soup-based udon, tempura, and dessert on the AYCE menu. Service is fast and prompt and I definitely think it's one of the better AYCE sushi joints in our land-locked state.\n\n\"Do you think I can sit here with my jeans undone?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'll do it too.\"\n\n#NoShame #OkayMaybeALittleShame
