I love my dog, even though she's a bitch. *rim shot*\n\nSo when I have to drop her off somewhere for a couple nights, I don't mind paying a bit more for a quality kennel.  And that's exactly what Club K9 is.\n\nI've used Club K9 only about 4-5 times over the last year.  Most kennels wouldn't consider that an A-list customer.  But they remember my dog every time.  \n\nThe only reason I didn't rate them with 5 stars is because my dog seems absolutely petrified of the place.  It's not like she has the heart of a warrior anyway, but I can never leave her there with 100% confidence as she's usually lunging away from the handler and screaming like a banshee.  That may not have anything to do with Club K9 or its employees, but I just couldn't give it the full 5 stars.  It's my dogs fault, (I told you she was a bitch.)\n\nI've had to call and ask them twice to stay 5 minutes after hours so that I could come grab my dog before their doors close on Sunday.  And while they obviously don't like to, they've stayed both times.  Gotta love that.\n\nI'd recommend them to anyone.
