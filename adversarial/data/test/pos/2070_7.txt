I wish I knew who wrote those comments. It's all exactly true and it's putting it mildly . Awful lazy uneducated staff. Although the simple tasks took all of five minutes they refused to do it. Or they passed the buck or you had to kiss A-- to get it done. Further more do it yourself.. The place did nothing. What a farce of a company. I can't stress enough the sadness of the residence having to go through this and the family's .Do not expect change when all above management does nothing to turn it around. What a mess. I can't stress enough what a struggle it was there . It appears to all be fine the first month when all these convincing smiles come your way . There will be no choice but to move out so don't even move in. There will be no medical attention and emergency buttons will not be answered . They will hire anyone off the street that's willing to work for a penny. How can those people treat those seniors so poor. They deserve everything that's said to be offered. Do your home work read reviews. I'm sorry for everyone who suffered pain as well as we did. God bless for some honesty and respect in these places.
