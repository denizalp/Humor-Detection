The good: As has been mentioned before, you're not going to find another gaming store anywhere that boasts 24-hour service or as many open tables. Their selection is top notch for most things, especially miniature gaming and CCGs.\n\nThe bad: Sometime in the wee hours of the night the Inn can get pretty rowdy. With a 30-seat LAN, there can be people who might need to go home and shower... Three hours ago.\n\nThe ugly: This isn't the gaming store to take your impressionable wife and kids, but if you like the crazed clubhouse feel, it won't disappoint.
