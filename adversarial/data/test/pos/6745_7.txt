We got to this pool a few weeks ago for the first time this summer season.  It was hot that weekend so we really wanted to enjoy the day here on a Sunday afternoon.  This isn't the closet pool near us but for the price and we do like this pool we come here.  My wife usually meets her best friend here the past few summers.  We have brought the kids a few times too.  This last trip we met our friends here and it was packed.  They got here first and saved us a spot in the lawn.  It used to be $7 a person for the day but now it $8 and they do take credit\/debit cards.  We like to just hang out ,read books, and solve mystery books.\n\n     They have a food stand that you can get your typical pool food and candy but we brought our own.  We packed chicken wraps, pretzels, fruit, and drinks.  So worth it!  \n\n     It was crowded this time but it's a big pool that gives you good space.  They have a 11ft deep area with two diving boards.  A big 5 to 6 foot area.  Then for kids they have a baby pool and a really short 2 to 3 foot area that's nice.  My son loves the diving board.  My daughter loved just jumping into the deeper part of the pool.  I'm always scared when they jump in on their own but i have to tell myself that they are 7 and 9 now and they always come right up!  This time we were here I was doing some flips off the diving board.  That hurt and Carrie smacked here back trying a flip.  Hilarious and fun!\n\n     They have a men and women's bathroom\/shower\/changing area that is clean and a good size.  We really like this pool and wish it was closer to us.  BTW there is a DQ right down the road for some late afternoon ice cream after swimming!
