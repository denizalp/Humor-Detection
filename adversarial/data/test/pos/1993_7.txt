Service was terrible. Felt like I was rushed from the moment I walked in the place. My check arrived 5 min after the food. As people began filing in, I felt they were just itching for me to leave. I laid down $17 for the $16 lunch (which was just average). I saw the cashier shake her head as she walked away with the money, assuming that the extra $1 was the tip. Little did she know I was planning on leaving a reasonable tip. Instead, she never returned with my change. When I questioned her, she stared at me, then said \"I thought that was the tip.\" She rushed back to the cash register and took $1 out and handed it to me and rudely said \"No tip?!\" I simply replied \"nope\" and walked out. \n\nI will never be back and I would encourage everyone else to do the same. Trust me, the food is not worth it.
