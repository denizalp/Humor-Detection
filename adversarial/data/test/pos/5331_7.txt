Excited to finally being able to try Burger Lounge after hearing countless praises about this place! It's a fast and casual restaurant. Once you order your meal, you will receive a buzzer and wait to pick up your meal. They have a small menu but they offer the basics of what you would want\/need\/expect at a burger spot- burger, sides, and milkshakes. \n\nI was able to try their lounge burger with a side of fries and a root beer float. The burger itself was too oily for my personal preference. The bottom bun was literally dripping out oil. I thought that was normal until I noticed that other people's burgers were not doing the same thing. Their fries were great! They were crispy and well-seasoned. The root beer float was enjoyable and was refreshing!\n\nThe food is a bit pricey for what you're getting. It's in the same price range as Bobby's Burger Palace (located right next door) but at BL, you don't get as much variety on the menu or in the burger. \n\nSeating is limited so if it is crowded, I suggest taking your food to-go. Burger Lounge is located by Aria's hotel exits, so there are plenty of seats outside where you can enjoy your meal and sightsee at the same time! I probably won't be coming back for the burgers but probably more for the convenience.
