The two stars go to this H&M's location concealing lots of goodies I don't always find at the other H&Ms. Plus, it's not usually as crowded as say the Queen Street location, or the Eaton Center location.\n\nBut, the reason I am only giving this location two stars despite their hidden gems, is due to a certain employee's lack of common courtesy, and really, seeming consciousness. \n\nPlease, just because you're wearing skinny jeans and what you presume to be uber-hipster large black framed glasses, don't act like a douche bag and treat customers with such disdain and disinterest that it leaves us wanting to run screaming from the store in disbelief that some people are actually raised without normal common-courtesy and people skills. \n\nThis said employee did not even look at me once, let alone make any attempt at eye contact or a smile, whilst I was trying on articles of clothing today. Perhaps what he thinks is his trendy and unique fashion-sense (yet is nothing but a carbon-copy of every other trendy-ish store employee or Queen Street West frequenter) entitles him to act like a complete idiot and creep, but he is sadly mistaken. I honestly questioned his sobriety and consciousness, for it seemed he could have at any second passed out.\n\nAnd please, for the love of God, do not subject us to your pretentious attitude which you are trying so hard to portray and slather all over yourself, as we are merely lowly customers who may be forced to throw down our clothes all over your highness's H&M fitting room counter in agony, for fear of having to witness how much of a douche bag you are any longer.
