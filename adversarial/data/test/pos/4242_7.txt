Word in the 'hood on this joint is that they've got a few negative karma points they need to live down. Something about stealing another establishment's menu and opening up a carbon copy of the object of their ... admiration.  Nonetheless I have been going here for the past 2 years because they are close and reasonably affordable. \n\nThey've since moved up the street into Krak's old space. Yes that was a real thing. That restaurant kept patrons away in droves with their small claustrophobic windows, heavy handed furniture and a general ambiance that suggested that medieval torture instruments were hidden in the basement. (You think I'm exaggerating only because you haven't seen the place.)\n\nBased on the decor you'd expect your tea to be served in a beer stein and for there to be pig snout in your California roll. \n\nI digress. I ordered there repatedly because the kitchen and staff were familiar. Until they weren't. \n\nIt also seems that since the move their fortunes have taken a turn for the worse.  The look of the place is uninviting and that has cut in to the traffic they see. This is understandably disappointing. But that does not excuse the poor quality of food or service that they subject their patrons to. \n\nIn a nutshell the food is subpar. The fish is ... Fishy. The rice is dry. And the chef seems put out the minute customers walk in the door. \n\nI'm all for getting crappy service if the food is exceptional. But without the latter, the former is just misguided.
