Food was really good my only complaint is that if you want cheese and guac on your rolled tacos its gonna cost you and extra 3.50 I just cant stomach paying almost 8 bucks on three rolled tacos.. the torta was good and good priced I just cant get over 23 bucks for 2 orders of rolled tacos and a torta..that's crazy!
