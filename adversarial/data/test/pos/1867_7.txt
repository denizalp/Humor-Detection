UPDATE: My warranty co. wanted them to come and give a second opinion on something. Do you know they demand that you give them availability for AN ENTIRE DAY?\n\nI notice that the company convinced Yelp to remove part of my original review.  The first visit from Aaron pools was a young man with a bad attitude that took my pool apart, then tried to leave my property with some of my parts.  He said he needed to go to the store to buy a new part and that he \"would be back in a few hours\"  Why?  I am less than a half mile from a Leslies, an Ace Hardware, and a Home Depot.  He was just buying some PVC fittings.  So, I told him I couldn't wait  another  \"few hours\" for him.  he got snotty and rude, so I told him to put my pool back together.  I had already waited for him for hours.  I would still like to know why he was leaving with my plumbing-he couldn't figure out that he needed to buy some 1.5 inch PVC and a coupler?\nThe women that answer the phone there are also unbelievably rude-that made me wonder if this guy was one of their sons.\nSo, several fruitless phone calls, one ridiculous pool technician, and I got hung up on once.\nIf you have a good experience with Aaron Pools, I want to know your secret.
