I didn't really like this place. They have a good selection of beers and food, but I tried their hummus and was very disappointed. I don't think it is difficult to make hummus and it's usually a pretty safe choice at bars, but not at this one. \n\nTheir burgers or mac and cheese seems like the bigger hits at this place.\n\nThis is a very typical bar, I don't really feel like it has anything special and I won't be going back.
