Living at the cusp between Toronto and Thornhill, I spent years in search of an amazing nail and aesthetic salon in my area.\n\nI tried many different places and always left unhappy with the service, the beauty operators and the prices... until Sandalwood magical opened just a hop, skip and jump away from my house! \n\nSandalwood opened its doors over a year ago and offers great services for nails, waxing, beauty treatments such as facials and massage therapy.\n\nI go there every week for my traditional manicure or polish change and I am always impressed for several reasons....\n\nFirst off, the staff are extremely friendly and are all equally talented when it comes to mani\/pedis, nail polish application and waxing.\n\nSecondly, they have a HUGE selection of nail polish colours to choose from! They only carry the top brands, such as OPI and Essie, and always have the latest specialty collections.\n\nThirdly, they always have special promotional offers to their clients. \n\nFor example, if you have one of their 1 hour, $80 aroma therapy massages, they give you a free pedicure with an additional salt scrub to your legs and feet, leaving your skin smooth and silky.\n\nAnd to top it off, they always have amazing herbal teas and yummy lattes ready as you walk in the door for your appointment.\n\nOverall, their prices are reasonable:\n\nManicure - $18\nPedicure - $28\nNail or toe polish change - $10\n\nAs well, they bring in a licensed massage therapist to take clients every Saturday and are able to help submit insurance forms if you are covered for such pampering.\n\nSandalwood takes clients both by appointment and sometimes by walking in if they are not too busy.\n\nIt is just wonderful when you want to primp yourself!
