So far, this is my favorite Gold's in Las Vegas.  I always wanted to workout at the Sahara and the Flamingo locations, but was told that they all closed down.  Oh well, this Gold's will just have to do. \n\nOut of all the locations I've been to, this has to be my favorite for a couple of reasons. \n\n1.  Free-Weights:  At this location, there's plenty of if.  Like I stated in a previous Gold's review, I love the steel plates.  Just that hollow sound of the plates banging against each other is music to my ears. \n\n2.  Plenty of machines and cardio.  My only issue with their cardio, the treadmills are sometimes out of order. \n\n3.  Location:  Not the closest Gold's to my home, but still a convenient one. I actually prefer driving the extra 8 miles to get here.  It's also close to a ton of post-workout eats, grocery shopping, BabyCakes, etc. Enough parking as well. \n\n4.  Clean gym with clean restrooms\n\n5.  Ambiance:  Since the Flamingo and Sahara locations are no longer around, you'll spot the occasional figure, bikini, and bodybuilding pros working out here.  Observing their workouts is like a free seminar. \n\nMy only gripe about this place is the lack of leg machines, specifically their leg extensions and lying leg curls.  Nothing beats free-weights, but there's still a place for machines like extensions and leg curls.  Since there's only one of each, you have to make sure that you step it up when you see it open up. \n\nPS:  Like all other gyms, this one is super packed on Monday's around 5 PM.  But because the peeps here do more working out, than socialize, getting on a specific machine or bench is usually not an issue.  All other days are pretty much tamed.
