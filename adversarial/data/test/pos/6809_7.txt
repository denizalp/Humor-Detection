IT'S SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIE. IT'S SO GOOD I WANNA LIVE.\n\nThese delicious, airy cheesecakes put me in this peculiar scenario of mortal duality. Being a biased matcha fan, I couldn't help but shoot for this place. It's definitely not as busy as the original cheesecake store next door, but they have a lot more to offer! From cakes to soft serve ice cream, come here for your green tea induced sensory overload. For $10 I acquired the traditional matcha cheesecake and split it with my friends. I honestly didn't want to, but sharing is caring. The cake was light, with a balanced sweetness and aggressive tea finish. It might not be for everyone, but I like great tea everything, so I was in heaven. This was totally the opposite of the heavy and sticky cheesecake I'm used to at home. We all were fine with eating it with our bare hands. This was a welcomed discovery!\n\nThe interior is very, very small for customers. The kitchen takes up most of the real estate. There's no seating; you just have to come in, order your stuff, and come out. I wish there was outside seating or something, but from what I'm told this place gets packed easily. Best to take your goods and make moves. The staff seemed very focused on cranking out the food, so there was no small talk or waves. The cashier was very friendly when I ordered, cool guy.\n\nNot sure how your taste buds will react to their pastries? They always have samples to try up front before buying. Taste with no regrets! I certainly purchased, but with only one regret: I didn't buy more while I was there.
