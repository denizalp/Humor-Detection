Stopped in to see what all the hype was about...\n\nWe decided on getting half a dozen oysters and  2 pounds of shrimp with  their shabang sauce.\n\noysters tasted watered down and lacked the briny flavor that I like in an oyster\nand I love Dungeness Crab, but for $14.99, you can get TWO out of a tank at 168 Market which is a much better deal IMO....Honestly, the shrimp didn't taste any different from what they serve up at their \"competitors'\" place.....\n\n+1 star though for being able to tag up the place with my magnum sharpie without having to look out for the po-po.....ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 Challenge-(90\/365) \"Got Crabs???\"
