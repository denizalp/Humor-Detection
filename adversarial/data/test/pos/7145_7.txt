I am not a fan of Sonic nor much fast food in general, but after dragging the man around town to see where I used to work ( moved back to CA just under 5 years ago), where I used to live as a teen, where I went to HS, where I owned a house, where my Grandparents used to live, etc. he felt like he deserved a treat and I agreed. Had we had more time and he endured the early childhood tour (3-10), he could have had Mary Coyle :)\n\nSonic has these crazy drink slushy concoctions and ice cream and just plain stoner food (chili, cheese and fritos wrapped in a tortilla). Since we were not hungry, he wanted an ice cream cone and a cherry lime slushy thing. So, we pull up, push a button and order. I had a large Diet Dr. Pepper, he had drink and cone...total $3.00! Why so cheap we wonder...then we see...Sonic has a happy hour on their drinks from 2-4pm. GTFO!! Seriously cool.\n\nWhy only 3 stars then...well, that was for the $3.00. Hey, it is fast food folks and to be honest, once I drank my drink and got down to the ice, I remembered that Phoenix water tastes nasty and that makes for nasty ice-even if it is crushed.
