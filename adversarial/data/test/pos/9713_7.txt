We came here before our show started. Our group had 9 people. We sat at a round table with a lazy-susan in the center. The ambiance was nice, and it was fairly dark in here. \n\nWe ordered edemame and spring rolls for appetizers. 6 different sushi, two pad-Thai with chicken, vegetable fried rice, orange chicken and sweet n sour chicken. After a short wait, our two appetizers were brought out. These were gone almost immediately, as there were so many of us. Then we sat and waited for a really long time. We waited nearly 30 minutes before we saw any more food. Then everything came slowly, starting with the sushi. A few minutes later, another dish would arrive, and a few minutes later...another. We finally had all of our food, and not very much time to eat it all. \n\nThe sushi was really good, and was very nicely displayed. The pieces were quite large. The pad-Thai was fairly good, but not the best I have had. The chicken pieces though, they were large and tender. Very good. I also tried the sweet n sour chicken, which was loaded with pineapple pieces. I really liked this dish.\n\nAfter asking the waitress for the check, as we needed to get to our show, she proceeded to continue filling up all 9 of our water glasses. That was so frustrating, as she did not realize our need to leave. \n\nAgain, the ambiance was nice, and the food was decent. If you do have a lot of time to spend, this place is quite nice.
