I've been to another location of U.S. Egg but it was a few years ago. I met some friends here for breakfast on a Sunday and it was lovely. Our servers were friendly and attentive and the vibe of the place was positive and welcoming. \n\nOur food came out quickly and I ordered the triple play, which comes with two eggs, two whole wheat pancakes (I added chocolate chips) and I choose hash browns instead of meat. The eggs and potatoes were fine, nothing spectacular but they're pretty easy to make. The pancakes though...so so good. I only ate one and took the other home. I had it for breakfast the next morning and it was tasty, I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted better reheated. \n\nGood food, fair prices, and quality service: no wonder this is a popular breakfast place.
