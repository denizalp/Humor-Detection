I called United Moving and from the beginning I had a very helpful and knowledgeable agent. I felt I could really trust this company to do my emotional and painful move back home. I provided my list of items and got an affordable price. I choose my moving date and when the movers came I found them to he honest and hardworking. They even helped me pack some items that meant a lot to me so they would be safe for my long trip. Shortly after I arrived home I got a call telling me my stuff would be coming by the end of the week, wow, so fast i thought but great, I was excited to unpack and settle in my new place. My movers showed up on time and I was pleased to see my things again. Everything, from the start, went as planned. Thank you to my consultant, my movers and everyone at United for making my transition as painless as possible.
