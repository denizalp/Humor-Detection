Glad there's finally a hot chicken spot in Vegas! \n\nI'm no expert on hot chicken, but Howlin Ray's was the best hot chicken I've ever had so far. Their seasoning is literally like crack. I waited 4 freakin hrs on a Saturday there, and it was worth every second. Luckily, there was no line at Hattie B's when I went last Friday with my buddy. \n\nI tried their chicken sandwich, and it was pretty good. I got the medium level spice, and it wasn't too spicy. The chicken breast was juicy and flavorful, and the crinkle-cut fries were excellent! I also got to try some of my buddy's half chicken with the \"shut the cluck up\" spicy level (which is the highest spice level), and it was pretty hot but manageable. The skin was really crisp, and the seasoning was great! \n\nHattie B's is thee spot for hot chicken in Vegas right now, but I still gotta give the hot chicken crown to Howlin Ray's. \n\nAlso, I asked for a cup of water, but they don't give cups of water. I think this applies to all the spots in Block 16 Urban Food Hall. Bottled water\/bottled soda is $5.\n\nPro tip: Bring your own water\/ soda if you can.
