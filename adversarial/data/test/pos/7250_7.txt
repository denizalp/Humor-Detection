Best mexican in america, PERIOD!  Worth a trip to Arizona to eat this stuff.\n\nThis was the only time that I ate my meal and then rudely ate the scraps off the four plates that my friends had left unfinished.  I don't care if they used MSG or Lard to make it so delicious...this is exactly what I would have ordered if Jesus had invited me to the Last Supper.
