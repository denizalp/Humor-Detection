The decision to cut the cord from conventional TV was easy.  That doesn't, however, mean my time with Cox is done... No, no.  Both entertainment and my job are dependent on a reliable, fast internet connection.  So while I'd like to say I can entirely wash my hands of this company, I can't just yet.  \n\nYes, the pricing was ridiculous.  The mysterious 'add-on' packages that would randomly show up on my bill and then take two or more months to resolve were frustrating to say the least.  But what really got me, what reeeeally made my head spin was the cancellation experience.  Funnily enough, I am on hold at this very moment - right now! - with a representative who has been 'cancelling' my service for the last 52 minutes and 27 seconds.  28.  29... You get the idea.  \n\nAfter putting me on a series of silent holds, the representative (who is friendly enough) comes back on the line to try to change my mind.  After reiterating that I just need the internet service, I'm put on a series of silent holds again.  This time when she returns, she tells me that there will be a $90 early contract termination fee.  Seriously at this point, I honestly don't mind paying it if it means I can get off this darn phone already.  I mean, really... here is my credit card number.  Take my first born child... Anything!  \n\nUntil something reasonable comes along that can compete with Cox's monopoly on high speed internet service, I guess I'm stuck with them.  But even if that's donkey's years away, I'm already dreading the cancellation phone call...
