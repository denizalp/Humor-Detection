It has become a must now every time i come to Vegas to hit this place up. not for the gambling but for the big slushy drinks which \"You can add and extra shot for only $1\". And yes i always cough up the extra $1. What else to go with the drink than a snack.. Freaking \"Deep fried Twinkies\". i never had any luck playing here, the place looks divey and the girls standing outside passing out beads seem old and tired but damn those deep fried twinkies keep me coming back.
