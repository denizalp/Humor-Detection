This store and people who work at the customer service doesnt deserve a one star!! Worse target brance ever! I always have proble every single time i order online and pick it up in this branch. The lady that assisted me tonight was soo rude and soo miserable. Once she saw what I have to pick up she then made a statement ' its a lot\" in a annoyed tone.. there are two lady at the guest service both of them are rude and  shouldnt be there because they dont know what CUSTOMER SERVICE is.. came there before 9pm .. the lady gave my first order then my second order and then i told her i think im missing one item. And she said thats all there is on that order and i told her can u pull up the order again coz this is what i have on my email and this is what I ordered.and she make me.feel like i was cheating her or something .. she insist no thats all on that order.. didnt offer to check on it again until i insist to show my email receipt. Then one guy came out who is helpful to check on my order and figured out whats going on why im missing one .he then explained that the missing item  was out of stock, i then replied can i just return them and he said they cant since it havent process the orders yet, so before i can respond to his statement i have to leave the guest service because daughter has to use the restroom.. so after we went on the restroom i went back and the only person that was there was the plus size woman and i ask her \" socan i jus return it\" she replied u would have to go back tomorow because our system havent processed it yet\" i then said i dont want to go back tomorow i even got the email.that my order was picked up and theres a return barcode in there, thats jus imposible i cant return it now . And she said im sorry but u have to.go back.tomorow.IM MORE pissed because the whole shoppi ng was already ruined by the lady who assisted me.. i ask the plus size woman whats the name of the lady that assisted me because she made the whole shopping uncomfortable and soo rude. And she replied to me \" sorry we cant give out names because they are team member\" i never heard such thing then the lady that assisted me came out like whats going on and with an attitude showing that shes ready to fight .. the guy then told her jus leave and she left the store with a smart ass tone \" have a nice night yall\" and then the plus sized woman added we cant talk about work issues because shes off the clock! I was like what the hell is wrong with this people.. i jus walked out pissed because i dont want to waste my time there anymore.. i hope the manager address the issues if they care about their customers..
