A friend suggested Altius for the fourth of July. We made reservations weeks in advance but were not guaranteed a table against the windows. We actually ended up in the second row but the view was still incredible! If you remember Georgetown, you'll be blown away by the transformation. The inside is sleek and modern. It looks like a restaurant that would be located downtown. \n\nFor the holiday there was a five course menu for $85 a person. Amuse bouche, appetizer, salad\/soup, entree and dessert. (I don't consider an amuse bouche an actual course seeing it's one bite. In this case it was a blueberry inside a raspberry with a brie sauce) Each course had 4+ options. I went with the charcuterie plate, salad, 10 oz filet and chocolate Panna cotta. The table was also served a choice of three breads. If given the choice, pick the foccacia as it was incredible. Each course was presented in a timely manner. I really enjoyed the filet though my cut was a little fatty (hubs filet was not). The presentation of each plate was gorgeous especially the desserts. Each course was very good and met my expectations. However, the highlight of the evening was easily the fireworks. Viewing the fireworks from the comfort of our table without having to deal with the Mt. Washington crowd was priceless. Overall, I would go back to Altius for a very good meal with an amazing view.
