First time here and will be my last. Figured I'd try the place out since it's new and I love Indian food. After waiting for almost ten minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant I knew by things weren't looking good. Finally seated and placed my order which included Lobster Masala (most expensive item on the menu at $25) and was told it would take awhile to make. Fine, it sounded like something worth waiting for. Twenty five minutes later \"IT\" comes out. Draped in sauce to hide the fact that it's not done. How hard is it to cook lobster???? You can visibly tell when it's done and when it isn't done. I ate my bread and appetizers and paid for the meal. The kicker is the hostess asked me if I wanted a discount for the undercooked lobster. If you have to ask, then you don't care about your mistakes. Take care of your customers and they will take care of you. I won't be back!
