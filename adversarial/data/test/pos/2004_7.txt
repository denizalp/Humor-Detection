Perhaps if I had eaten any food I could rate the food but this is a rating of service only. \n\nAfter a short wait to be seated I was given a table and a menu. When five minutes had passed and no one had come to the table not even to bring a water I was starting to wonder where a server was. After another five minutes had passed I was becoming rather annoyed. I decided to wait another two minutes for anyone to come to the table and when no one did I left.
