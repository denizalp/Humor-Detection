How rude!\n\nSERVICE\nT&T has a hot food area and after a certain time in the evening, the prices get reduced.  I was talking to another customer and he showed me what he got for $4.99. It was a distinct vegetable dish and he told me to get one.  There were no more left on sale rack so I went over to the service counter (where they were packing the rest of the food to put on the sale rack) to ask whether I could have one. \n\nShe packed one for me and put a sticker saying $5.99. I was surprised b\/c she charged me more than the other man and thought she could get away with it.\n\nI told her that the man next to me had the same one and was charged $4.99. So she took my container back, ripped my container open, put half of the contents into another container and repacked it up and put a $4.99 sticker on it.\n\nShe did this right in front of me.
