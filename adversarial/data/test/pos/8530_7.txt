Sorry I have to vent, We came to your establishment today and bought three cupcakes and three cookies. Cupcakes and cookies fantastic as always. I just wanted\/needed a small drink of water to rinse my mouth after eating my cupcake in establishment. I asked for small glass and was told I could buy a bottle of water from cooler at $1.50. The water was a sparking spring water which I do not care for and I also was being treated to the cupcake from my daughter in law as I didn't have any money. This made it a little embarrassing for me and after we just spent $15.00 I feel was pretty low. I have come into this store and have purchased items over ten times. One time I bought $40.00 worth and you couldn't get me a small glass of water!!!!!! I will spread the word about this. I probably will never purchase cupcakes her again!!!!!! There are plenty of other cupcake stores!
