I hate this place so much . I ordered the Sweet Chili Glazed Udon I hated it so much\n I ordered more to take home after. The service was so awful!\n so tipped her $10 extra! The bar mojito was terrible I had buzz immediately! and I tipped even more cause of that.\n I don't recommend this place unless ............\nyou want the best udon soup in your life! \nThen be miserable and go there then!\nFair warning!
