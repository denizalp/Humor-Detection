Tempe Beach Park is truly a special treat to Phoenix. No, we might not have an ocean or even a lake, but we do have a large canal that was converted into \"Tempe Town Lake\" several years ago and with that, they built up a wonderful Tempe Beach Park. \n\nWhere to even begin? \n\nTempe Beach Park really has it all. It has plenty of grass alongside the water for people to picnic and relax on, it has a playground for children to play on and it has plenty of permanent and visiting activities throughout the year. \n\nFor the permanent activities, one of my favorites are the paddle boat rentals. It's such a fun activity that someone of any age can enjoy it. Whether you have a family, you're on a date, or you simply want to do something entertaining with friends, going to Tempe Town Lake for a picnic and some paddle boating makes for a great weekend day. Tempe Town Lake also has an awesome jogging\/biking trail that goes for miles. In addition, they have a dock for boats and I'm pretty certain you can rent boats and kayaks to take on the lake.  \n\nNow moving on to the visiting events. I feel like every major event comes to Tempe Beach Park. In the fall, the Oktoberfest comes to town. In March, they have a huge St. Patty's Day event. They have Greek Fest's, sister city events, art fairs and a plethora of concerts and walks throughout the year. This is a great resource to look into if you are ever looking for a fun festival or event, or you are organizing one and looking for the perfect venue. \n\nSo while we might not have a natural water source in the Valley, they have done an amazing job of converting the water we do have into a family-fun atmosphere for all.
