********IMPORTANT INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE BEEN JERKED AROUND BY UPS AND STILL DON'T HAVE YOUR DELIVERY*******\n\nThe OFFSHORE call centre at 1-800-742-5877 are exasperating, not properly trained, and half they time you can't hear them and they can't hear you (poor telephone line quality - their call centre is in the Philippines).  Level of competence is questionable - frankly, its a joke.  It will take you 40 minutes to escalate your call to a Manager and\/or Supervisor - who will turn out to be as unhelpful as everyone else in that call centre.\n\nCALL THE NUMBER IN THE UNITED STATES AND GET SOME ACTION REGARDING YOUR MISSING PARCEL (this number is not on the website); I had to call several offices in Atlanta to get this # for the Canadian\/North American customer service issues.  I spent a good couple of hours searching for this information - so if I can help anyone going through this grief and aggravation, I am happy to do so.\n\nFOR COMPETENT CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL:\n**********************************************************\n404.828.4900 (Executive Office, in Atlanta, GA) and e-mail them at customerrelations@ups.com.  These guys are competent.\n\nThey will help you resolve your issue.  If only I had spent some time online getting this information without waiting 3 days for my parcel which was supposed to arrive.  You need nerves of steel dealing with UPS.
