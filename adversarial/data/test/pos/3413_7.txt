The customer service is on point! The ambience is      Very chic and had that industrial vibe. Our appetizer was on point. The lamb tacos and deviled eggs is a must!! We also ordered the burger and bangers and mash. The burger was okay it was a lil on the soggier side for me. But the bangers and mash was delicious. The sauce was so good. Will come back!!
