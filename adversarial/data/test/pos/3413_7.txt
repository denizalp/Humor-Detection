Classic Cakes and Confections is one of a kind. I have yet to walk into a cake store in the valley that made me feel like a kid in a candy store.\n\nThis tiny little shop has actual real cakes on display throughout the shop. Now don't let the flowerpot with a beautiful bouquet fool you when you first walk through the door. The real so life looking ganache plant, shovel and dirt is an actual cake. The cakes you find on display at this lovely shop are so unique I think personally I would not want to eat them. The beautiful detail of the hand made creation are \"AMAZING.\" Each cake is special designed and tailored to your specific need. The Tiffany Bag had my eyes stuck like glue. Yes, the beautiful blue bag that women dream of is an actual cake on display in the store. I even saw a brown handbag that looked like the high end ones in the store. Besides all the creative cakes such as a golf set or robot I saw the most beautiful wedding cake with so much detail it left me speechless. \"I found my future wedding cake.\"\n\nThe store has cakes ranging from small to low end cakes. Each cake serves a purpose so the prices are based on ones need. The store offers dinner cakes from Red Velvet with Cream Cheese Butter cream to Chocolate Butter and much more. You can choose from various flavors and fillings. \n\nThe gentlemen who helped me was very knowledge and helpful. Though I did not by anything my browsing experience was so much fun. I am sure I will use this cake store in the future but I will defiantly in the mean time going to refer them.
