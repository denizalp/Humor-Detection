My girlfriend and I flew Spirit for the first time on our way to Seattle and had no issues. Employees were very friendly and check in and boarding was straightforward like any other airline. It's a budget ala carte airline, so nothing is included in the flight price except for one carry-on personal item. The seats on the plane don't recline, snacks and beverages are not complimentary, and using the lavatory costs 50 cents.... Just kidding on the last one.  \n\nThe seats were a bit snug, especially with a slightly larger gentleman sitting next to me on our layover flight from Vegas to Seattle, but it wasn't unbearable.\nSome of the flight attendants were pretty funny with their safety talks and they did an amazing job of handling a medical emergency that one lady had on our flight into Seattle.  The paramedics escorted her off the plane as soon as we arrived at the terminal.  The pilots landed the plane smoothly, our luggage arrived intact, and flights took off on time. We actually landed a bit early too.\n\nNo real major complaints except for the cost of the tickets...around $450 round trip after taxes for each of us with one checked bag. We were expecting cheaper, but whatever.  It was the cheapest option at the time.\n\nI'd fly Spirit again as long as the price is right.
