I've seen great reviews for Kailyn's Kitchen on Yelp and I came across a restaraunt.com gift certificate for them - so, put these two together and you get - a really great meal on the cheap!\n\nThe place is called \"Kailyn's Diner\" inside the restaurant. It has the feel of a diner. There is minimal seating. I have heard the place really gets busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. When my husband and I were there, it was just us and a few patrons sitting at the bar.\n\nThe service is down-home feel. The waitress was very nice, the owner\/chef asked us how our food was. It is like eating in a small cafe, in a small town, except, you're in Las Vegas on the East Side in a not-so-great shopping center. \n\nBUT - the burger. OMG the Seoul Burger! \"Korean barbecue glazed patty topped with mushrooms and smoked Gouda cheese, and kimchee mayo\". This burger was perfectly done - sauce was tangy, mayo was creamy and spicy, comes with lettuce, tomato, and red onion - on a beautiful Brioche bun! Also comes with your choice of fries, garlic fries, or homemade chips. I got the garlic fries - delish! \n\nHusband had the pancake platter, which is a little lacking. It only comes with one pancake and one slice of bacon with a small side of eggs. My hubby ordered another pancake for extra.\n\nI also had a house salad to start, which was OK. One thing I can say is they included mushrooms in my salad which I LOVE because I always add mushrooms to my salad at home, but it's a rare sight to see in restaurants.\n\nWe ended the meal with the craziest dessert - Bacon covered in cookie dough and deep fried, sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was OK. My husband did not like it at all so I ate all three. (Fatty fat fat...)\n\nBUT - THE BURGER, OMG THE BURGER!
