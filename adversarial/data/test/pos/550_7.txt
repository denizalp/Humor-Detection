New Happy Hour menu for drinks. Personal pitchers are only $5 or a bigger pitcher for $7 with mostly domestic beers at that price point. Not a huge crowd for cardinals game, so plenty of elbow room at the bar. Also tried the #17 Chicky wrap, which contained some quality beer battered chicken fingers, good slaw and a good dose of chopped onions. The fingers were top quality and it was served with a giant portion of crisp, slightly spiced chips and salsa. Not a bad time during happy hour and plenty of TV's to watch games as well.
