The spruced man that stands by the main register is not well mannered. I was answered about a product I was looking for with a \"AH? I DON'T KNOW! MAYBE THERE!\" brushed me off and pointed to the isle the product I wanted was at. Don't worry, I found it after looking for it for 10 minutes.\n\nAside from this impertinent man, the store seems to have a variety of products. They're always busy and their shelfs are stocked frequently. \n\nI was also told their tofu is fresh, so much so that a coworker of mine eats it raw. \n\nUnfortunately it's hard to find some products. Most packaging are in Asian writing and I don't understand it.
