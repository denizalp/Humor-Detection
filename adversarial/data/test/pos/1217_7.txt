This is quite possibly the worst store in all of Las Vegas. I was disgusted with the merchandise. I walked into this store, walked around for a bit to check the store out and was not greeted once by anyone. If you're in the las vegas area for old garbage collectibles this is the place to go. Never have I wanted to throw up more then when I saw the pure ugliness of this establishment. What a disgrace to the city of Las Vegas.
