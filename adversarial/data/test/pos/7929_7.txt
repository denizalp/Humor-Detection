Oh. My God. Drop every single thing you're doing right now and go to Salt of the Earth. Go ahead, I'll wait. Go eat there, then come back and give this review a big ol' \"Useful\" (I also accept gifts) for leading you to the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe surroundings are modern and warm, and the waitstaff is friendly, professional and knowledgable. The food is conscientious, complex, delicious, quality, and surprisingly reasonably priced. When I went, none of the entrees were more than $25, and the portions are perfect.  I was really afraid this was going to be a fancy $40, 2oz fillet with celery foam pretentious place, and it was the total opposite. The menu is written on a giant chalk board, and you can also download it to your phone if you want to read it in hand. There's a set of specialty cocktails, wines by the glass and bottle and beer for libations. The appetizers are big enough to share, and are all around $10. Get the cockscombs. Yep, that weird thing on the top of a chicken's head. Get it. Eat it. Love it. Get dessert too. Goat cheese ice cream with raw honey, crushed pistachios, and lavendar-infused white chocolate-- how you gonna say no?? Finally, they have the chemical symbol for salt on their exterior. Nerds rejoice!
