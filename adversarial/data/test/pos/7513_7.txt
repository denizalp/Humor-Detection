A burger? With anything I want? FINE....I'll do it.\n\nI need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.) \n\nEarleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.\n\nI stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?\n\nIt was PACKED! But I digress.\n\nAs soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)\n\nYou get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.\n\nOrdering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!\n\nMy food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc. \n\nThe fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!! \n\n(I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).\n\nUltimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again.\n\nOh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!
