This place is nasty, my fiancé and I had the worst experience at this restaurant. We ordered 5 tempura rolls and a shrimp hibachi and they give us the wrong order. This was a Togo order, when my fiancé got home I tried the first bite and I almost trow up. It was the wrong order with some kind of nasty tuna. \nWhen we called to let them know they never answered the phone. \nWe live about 30 mins away from this restaurant, and as soon I was able to come back to the restaurant the next day, I brought of corse the nasty wrong order in order to ask them for a new order, not only a refund but the right order. \nWell the manager, \"Janene\" said that they can't do anything about it. I even show her the menu online where it shows how confusing it is because it has a  description along with a different item. \nNo refund, no food, no nothing... Wow wow wow  \n\nNever going back I feel disgusting and VERY disappointed!!!\n\nThey were very mean and definitely no customer service skills!!!\n\nI don't recommend this restaurant - totally a turn off in all ways!
