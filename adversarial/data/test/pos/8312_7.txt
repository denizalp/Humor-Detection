This whole market has something for everyone! There's stuff for the bathroom, the kitchen and a great selection of wine to choose from. In the middle of the store I found a guy named Jeremy having a wine tasting! What a great way to spend a Saturday! If you are looking for wine at a good price this is a great place to get it!\n\nOh yes, for those of you who use the Braggs Apple cider vinegar this is the place to get it kist $5.99 for a big bottle; but you have to wait for them to restock because I just brought the last two!
