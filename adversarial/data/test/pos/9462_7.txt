One of the difficulties I find when traveling to the East End or Strip district is parking. Not here. Alida's shares parking lot space with the Roberto Clemente Museum lot. When I arrived I was told I could park there safely since they own a portion of that lot.\n\nI came in for lunch and pretty much had the whole place to myself. They have a bar off to the side with a couple of TV sets. My waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu choices. I've always loved meatball hoagies but never ordered them since they are usually served in hoagie buns.\n\nHere they are served in thin paninis. Along with my sandwich I got a side of French Fries and ordered a cup of wedding soup. Alida's serves free bread with dipping sauce but believe me with the portion sizes you are getting there is no way I could even finish a slice of that bread.\n\nThe soup came fairly quickly with crackers. It was spot on delicious! Shortly afterwards I got my panini and although it was huge I was glad the panini was on the thin side. Meatballs were very good and very filling! Nothing special about the fries. They are the kind you pretty much get anywhere.\n\nMy waitress showed me dinner, drink, and dessert menus but there was no way I could even order dessert after all that food. Price of my lunch was fairly reasonable too.\n\nAlida's Woodfire Cucina sits right next to the Clemente museum and at the juncture of Penn Ave and Butler St in lower Lawrenceville. Having the free parking helps since they do have a small sign outside indicating parking with an arrow facing forward but there is nothing telling you which is their lot without going inside. I'm glad I took a chance and was able to get that matter clarified.
