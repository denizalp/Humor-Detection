A while back I had heard about the Yardbird in Miami and had hoped that they'd open a location closer to Los Angeles at some point.  So when I realized that I was going to finally be able to try it out in Las Vegas I was excited.\n\nThe ambiance here is pretty cool: dimly lit, southern lounge kind of vibe with plush couches spread all about.  It sort of reminded me of one of my southern cousin's living rooms in Georgia.  You can opt to sit at a table here, but let's be serious-- considering how cozy the couches are, I don't see a reason to wait for a table or sit at the the bar on a hard stool when you can have fried chicken served to you on a couch.\n\nUpon first glance at the menu my inner fat boy was overwhelmed with excitement.  Mac n cheese, pancakes, fried chicken, waffles, shrimp and grits, cornbread and not to mention an array of southern inspired cocktails that sound really good when you're not hung over from the night before like we were.  We opted for the fried chicken, cheddar waffle and cornbread.\n\nThe presentation of the plates at the Yardbird is great.  The plates look like your Auntie from the deep south who hasn't seen you in 15 years is excited that you've come to visit and because she's so excited, she has piled the fried chicken high on your plate and added extra butter everywhere because she loves you so much.  Meanwhile the flavors of the food here are kind of hit and miss.\n\nThe cheddar waffle wasn't very good at all, but the bourbon maple syrup that comes with it was really good.  I would have been happy with a regular fluffy waffle and not a fancy cheesey one.  The fried chicken left a little something to be desired.  The skin was crispy as it should have been but something about the seasoning was off.  I didn't really enjoy the chicken.  The plate also comes with watermelon, which by itself would have been nice and refreshing but at Yardbird they douse it with a little seasoning, that to me at least, is overkill.  The cornbread was just alright.\n\nI left the yardbird slightly disappointed as my conclusion here is that while everything we ordered sounded really good, it didn't quite deliver on taste, but as with all things in Vegas, if you're drunk enough, you'll probably enjoy it!
