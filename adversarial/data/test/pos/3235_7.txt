How can you not love XS?\n\nI can't count the number of times I've been here, but a good night here is unforgettable.  XS really knows how to celebrate.  I came on a night that Calvin Harris was playing.  Forget fog machines or confetti coming down.  They literally made it rain money.  I had so much fun dancing.  Smiles all night long =)
