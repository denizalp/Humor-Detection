Having to see the doctor is never fun but when you have a Doctor Who has a good sense of humor,  and always has a smile and he's carrying that's a plus. Dr Walters has been my doctor for two years now, he has taken care of all my needs and makes sure I have my prescriptions on time. I became sick a couple days ago with a sinus infection and I did not have to wait for an appointment , they got me in right away, his staff are very friendly and caring, I never wait long to be seen, I think the longest I've ever waited was about 15 minutes, they're waiting room is very clean with lots of reading material and a widescreen TV . Their lab is on site so you don't have to wait to get your blood drawn. His Nurses are very caring and they log everything in the computer before he even comes in the room to see you . I think very highly of Dr walters and trust him with all my health needs . I'm with honor health so I'm not sure what other insurance he acceptance .
