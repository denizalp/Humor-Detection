Seriously, they don't deserve any stars!\nThey really need to advertise that this cafe is a training facility.\n\nDrive thru 10-15min wait with no one in front of me. Repeated my order when I got to the window. Got a crunchy icey smoothie! \nBecause it took that long I didn't have any time to go back and wait another 10-15min for another one. \n\"People have important things to do like go to work and be efficient and make money not waste my time waiting for a smoothie in a drive thru\"\n\nSo I kept my crunchy, ice chunked, not able to drink smoothie until my break thinking it'd be ok then, NOPE! I was wrong. So I decided to call and let them know so my new drink would be ready and I didn't have to waste time again waiting.\n4 attempts to call and all I got were busy signals! Finally, it rang several times BUT no one answered, and no voicemail 3 other times. \n\nI went back to the cafe NOT drive thru and I kid you not 6 workers sitting looks like a meeting of some sort, 5 workers in kitchen and 2 up front.  I walk in and No One knows what the hell their doing in there! \n\nOMG I don't even want to continue. \nFor the price I pay with their service so not worth it. Like one of the yelpers said\n\"They're consistent in being INconsistent\"\n\nI hope management and owners read these reviews and do something about it, it's not just 1 customer complaints.
