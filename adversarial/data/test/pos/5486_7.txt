YYoga is finally open in Toronto!! I was a big fan of this in Vancouver as there are many locations all over the city there. Hopefully when YYoga is more established here we will see centre's popping up all over the city.\n\nBecause I previously was a member in BC I had already used up my unlimited month for $40 (if you're new grab that for sure), but I did jump on the month to month at a discounted price which ended up being $118 with tax. Considering the premium facility you are getting with the membership and the organic shampoos, soaps, conditioner, the beautiful change rooms, the sauna, and just the entire atmosphere in here it's worth it. \n\nThe spin classes here are different than the ones in Vancouver, there is no yoga at the end, just pure spin. So far the best spin class I have been to in the few weeks since they opened was with Catherine Mortimer on Saturday and Sunday mornings. You know when you are getting a good work out when you want to physically assault the person teaching the class because your body hurts so much. I also very much enjoy Ian Jarvie's spin classes, he focuses on proper spin technique which is essential in preventing injury.\n\nAnother highlight: Hot Yoga with Megan Marie Gates, and Vieslav Krystyan. Great instructors, great work out, incredibly relaxing. Oh and hey, people in the hot yoga class who don't use mat towels.... what is that wizzardry? My hands slip off my mat if I don't use one.\n\nBONUS: beside the two studios upstairs there is a small door to the left hand side. I hear, from other members of YYoga, by going in that small door that you become John Malkovich. How could you not want to join?
