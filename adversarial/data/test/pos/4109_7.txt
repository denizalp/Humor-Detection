Came here last night with my wife to pick up the traditional Christmas ham. This location is brand new and thus very clean\/organized. They have a set path for the line to make things easier to manage while also allowing customers to sample their different sauces\/mustards prior to reaching the registers. Since it's only us two this Christmas, I was a little worried they wouldn't have a ham portion that was small enough. However, I was proved wrong! We were able to get a boneless quarter ham that was the perfect size thanks to the assistance of HoneyBaked staff. Not to mention, they did it with a smile and no sense of being rushed at all! Supreme customer service! Looks like I found my new spot for high quality ham.\n\nPS: at the time of this review, there is no signage above the entrance yet. Just go a few doors to the left of the new Fry's Marketplace (same building) and you'll find it no problem!
