Eh. It's OK... He kept asking me if I was alright every five ten minutes which was annoying. He smelled like cigarettes especially his hand and I could smell it even more when he was rubbing my neck and shoulders. The massage was just OK, very routine. A good masseuse would feel where the knots are and work them. I would give them two stars but they were friendly.
