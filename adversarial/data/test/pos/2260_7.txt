Gosh, I still love Ohio City Burrito. A lot. Cue yesterday! When one of my other favorite nearby establishments was randomly closed despite their hours. Then I remembered, \"OCB!\" and felt ridiculous, like its that dude I've been friend-zoning for a while. It had been a while, but now that we're back together, I re-see the light, because he's awesome.\n\nI always stick with the Brother's Burrito with guacamole, rice, any meat, veggies galore and salsa. Their ingredients always feel significantly fresher than other places. At OCB, all of their meat is juicy and tender. Whereas at other spots I may just get chicken, you can truly get the pork or carnitas here and be completely happy. I can't explain how satisfying I find their burritos.\n\nThe staff is awesome and friendly despite being open quite late. Anyone who I can talk about dogs with is an A+ human in my book and they are always pleasant to see. OCB's awesome, inexpensive eats make them worth the trip every time. When you're checking out at the register, don't forget to ask if they have any horchata or fresh limeade. They make some of the best horchata around town! Viva la OCB.
