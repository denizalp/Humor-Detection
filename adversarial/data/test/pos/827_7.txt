Not sure why the hype here. Shawarma is incredibly tiny; little meat and even less pickled items included. I suppose you get what you pay for with a shawarma pita costing 6.75 but, completely unauthentic - even BBQ sauce put in the wrap! \nTwo stars BC the staff was friendly, place was clean, low price.
