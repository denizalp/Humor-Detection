We were just returning from ER and needed some tacos to lighten the mood, it was 8:45 pm and knew we would be approaching closing time based on our GPS ETA.\n\nThe man answering the phone kindly waved any of our poor etiquette and put our order in.\n\nWe arrived, yup 8:57 pm and even as they were cleaning up the restaurant, they happily greeted us and even went out of their way to ask if we needed silverware.\n\nThe ordering style reminds me of Hanbaneros off of Stoughton Rd. We chose the tacos, with steak. You can choose from two colorful salsas; Red or Green and load it up with veggies.\n\nWe wanted to stay authentic with only cilantro and onions. Quac is $0.50 for a total of $7.86 with tax before tip, ask for it on the side as I think you'll get more. Pickled jalapenos appeared from a can, but I can't be for certain. The meat was very good. It's always a little sketchy to order steak from a hole-in-the-wall, but the stead didn't have any fat or gristle and not chewy.\n\nThey accept credit cards!
