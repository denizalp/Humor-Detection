horrible.  the meat was barley cooked, The centre was cold.  the cheese didnt melt.  I was going to send it back, but then they would spit in the centre of it for you, and they lock you in by paying first....  The stuffed burgers are just a gimmick you can find on any at home shopping channel and do it yourself at home.\n\nNever ever go here - the hype is paid for publicity.
