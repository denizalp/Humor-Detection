Man, these bean burritos are so good. I've been a fan of America's since they opened their original spot which is now closed. Just went there with my wife this weekend and their service was excellent. I don't actually typically recall service being a noteable benefit of eating there, but this one visit in particular was very pleasant. Keep it up guys!\n\nMust gets for me are: Bean Burrito, Breakfast Burrito and a Quesadilla. And a huge Fanta.
