I have been coming here since Dec 2009.  Shame on me for not doing a review sooner.  This is my favorite spot for their yummy chicken tom yum goung (sp?) soup with small noodles.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about it!  I've tried their crab fried rice, pad thai, duck fried rice, fried chicken wings, papaya salad and curries and they have all been good.  They do tend to get really busy around noon, so keep that in mind.  Other than that, good food for cheap prices, this place will not disappoint.
