Somehow I wound up inside this little Persian nook on a drizzly November day and entrusted the fate of my stomach to the kitchen and recommendation of the hostess. I am now in fact entrusting the hostess with all my future life decisions. \n\nThe restaurant interior is nothing fancy, but pleasant and inviting. As you sit down with the menu and after placing an order, you'll have time to admire the unique Iranian relics and tiling, and if you're lucky, you might even be comfortably nested amongst the pillows in the traditional dining area. Be charmed by soothing Persian tones over the speakers. Arriving close to opening time on a weekday is a good bet if you don't like to wait, as there were only three parties (including myself) enjoying our meals.\n\nIt being a cold, rainy, early winter morning in Toronto, the hostess recommended the Haleem (my other choice, Guisaveh, was also vouched for but ultimately vetoed). I got mine with a small side of Yogurt (topped with rose petals and cardamom). Anyone who is a fan of conjee, gruel, porridge, and the like should prepare to have their taste buds collectively explode. The top layer of Haleem is a sweet, buttery, cinnamon-spiced membrane, but just beneath is a savory concoction of oh-so-tender lamb and barley. I noted some salt and pepper as well as a large bowl of sugar on each table, so it seems like spice-layering is common practice. It was several bites in when I remembered that I also had two pieces of Barbari bread, which are good by themselves or dipped quickly into the Haleem. The bowl was big - I don't think I could have finished such a hearty meal without the tartness of the yogurt to cut the rich Haleem. \n\nI practically skipped across the street to the TTC stop after paying - no excuses if you don't have a car. No complaints from me or my stomach, and I certainly left feeling like no amount of gloomy weather could stop me from enjoying the rest of my day.
