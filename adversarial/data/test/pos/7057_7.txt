We really like this tropical themed place with good prices and booth seating- we've been here a few times. (We've also tried the one @ Ala Moana too BTW.) Always has very nice servers and hosts- smiling faces. \n\nMy husband always gets a burger- now comes with fresh cut fries. I think he gets the Hawaiian- pineapple, teriyaki sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, & swiss cheese. I've had the Kilauea- jalapeno, black pepper, pepper jack cheese, chipotle, lettuce, & tomato- tasty for the person who likes a little spice, like me. I've also had the sandpiper- grilled chicken breast, saut√©ed mushrooms, swiss, lettuce, tomato & mayo- I always scrape it off because every place puts too much of it. Otherwise, very gratifying eats. \n\nAlso on the menu are: chicken sandwiches, tuna sandwich, wraps, soft tacos, salads and soups. For those of you watching your waist line, the  \"Paradise Bikini Beach\" menu- kinda like Applebee's lighter menu, listing the total calorie count. \n\nThe last time we were here (around summer), there were a couple of senior ladies across from us, who kept staring at us and our food- they even tried to make conversation, \"Ooh, is it goooood?\" But my annoyed husband, who hates when people stare at his food, opened up a menu and placed it standing up, so they couldn't look at us anymore- I think they got the hint. They were pretty chatty and talked to several other people in passing. Other than that, we enjoyed our meal here.\n\nOverall a great place for burgers. It's fairly popular with people of all ages and a good crowd is always here for lunch (the only time we're here). And then afterward we walk around in some of the stores in the area.
