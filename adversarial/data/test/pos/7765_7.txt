Atmosphere is supposed to imitate Italy, and it does a pretty good job considering I have never been there myself. They have a gym, lots of independent family owned, high line retailers, Brio Italian food, and a breakfast joint with amazing coffee that I usually visit for. It is a very nice place to walk around to see all of the neat places they have here. They also have valley and tons of parking, so there is never an issue with that. Not ever crowded so long as I have been coming here, but I foresee more companies leasing spaces for this place to become a hot spot in Vegas
