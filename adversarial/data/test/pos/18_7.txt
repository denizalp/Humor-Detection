First of all I have to say I hate all McDonalds so this might be a bit biased. My daughter was really hungry and wanted some chicken nuggets (yes, I disapprove of chicken nuggets in all shapes and forms but decided once in a while is OK). We ate inside. When we opened the door I noticed it was almost as hot inside as it was outside. It was so hot in there!! Do they not have air conditioning? I know McDonalds is low budget but that is ridiculous! \n\nNo one was speaking English behind the counter and when that happens I don't know why but I always feel like they are talking about me because I can't understand them. My Spanish is very limited. \n\nAfter my daughter finished her meal we went up to get her a snack McFlurry. It is advertised for $1.00 but in the small print it says with a meal. Since we had purchased two meal I thought that qualified but that's not the case. You have to order it when you order your meal. Really? Why is that? What kind of Nazi made that rule and then sticks to it? Why would you order it with the meal just to have it sit there and melt in the stifling hot smelly eating area? Makes no sense. This place is just stupid with stupid people running it. My daughter was really looking forward to the McFlurry but after we were told we would have to pay full price even she understood why I almost flipped them off then walked out the door.
