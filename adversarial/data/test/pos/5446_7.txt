The hotel lobby is really beautiful (love it!) as are the fountains outside. It has a lot of great restaurants and shops like Elements, Javier, Bardot Brasserie or Jean Georges Steakhouse. However, I would say that in the majority of them the air-conditioning is too strong.\n\nThey also have a great casino! It's pretty big, a tad dark and not as loud as you would imagine. Even though there's a lot of slot machines and poker tables there, it's not as flashy as to cause you immediate migraine. The waiting lines for cash games are not very long and there is a lot of cheap tournaments for amateurs. The staff is very polite and quick and I haven't seen any drunk and aggressive people there. Also, the drink bar nearby is great.
