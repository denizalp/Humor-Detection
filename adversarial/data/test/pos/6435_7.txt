There is only 1 thing that trumps free booze at a Yelp Event; a free trip to Vegas.  I got to leave the Yelp Atlanta Gilded Age and proceed directly to the City of Sin.\n\nI am a somewhat frequent business traveler.  One of the destinations I always look forward to is Las Vegas.  What's not to love?  Everything is legal, even those things that are illegal become legal when you enter Las Vegas airspace (even if they remain illegal they are still legal).\n\nLikewise, morality holds not weight in this town.  Morals are frowned upon in Las Vegas.  You want morals, go to the desert.  With that said, THEhotel is a fine place to set up your temporary homestead.\n\nAs an all-suite hotel your room can comfortably sleep 7 (if you're into the group thing). The large master bath accommodates 3 with ease.  The only knock here is the lack of the additional sink, you will have to make due with simply his and hers sinks (minus the additional hers sink that would otherwise complete the hers\/his\/hers triumvirate).  The glass enclosed shower is sufficient for at least a standard 42R gentleman and two accompanying size 5 and under companions.  Likewise with the deep tub, similar proportions are easily manageable if a sharp eye is kept on the water levels.  The additional half-bath ensures proper decorum while entertaining.  The ihome system keeps the soundtrack rocking (or grooving during quiet storm hours).  TVs in the living room (complete with DVD), bedroom and bathroom keep you \"entertained\" when entertainment is required.\n\nBy now you get the point, this is a fine establishment for reconnecting with ones primal self.\n\nUnfortunately for this poor chap, there is nothing that can happen at THEhotel that will remain at THEhotel.  \n\nAs a somewhat vital guy for a large event our company produces at The Mandalay Bay Resort there are few VIPs on staff at the resort I don't know on a first name basis.  From the head of Security to the head of Housecleaning I literally know them all.  Though I get the ultimate perk in free room and board at the property the lack of extracurricular possibilities will cost them a star!\n\nAll in all it's like kissing your sister.
