She might not have actually sang one damn word the entire show, but shit! We LOVED IT. Bitch be workin! (And, sidenote: She rakes in $475,000 a show. YEAH. YOU READ THAT RIGHT.)\n\nWe loved it so much we spent $45 - FORTY FIVE - dollars on a hat that proclaims, \"WORK BITCH.\" No wonder she makes bank.\n\nBritney must have had me in her spell.\n\nI'm not a fan, really, of Brit. I mean, I listened to her stuff when it came on the radio back in my college years, but I'm not like my wife who WAS DYING TO SEE HER.\n\nShe still put on one hell of a show and I haven't been able to stop listening to her tracks on Spotify for the last week. I also have taken a habit to skipping a'la Britney down my apartment's hallway. Yes, there's a whole shitton of skipping and arm waving - but she does this every night and ole girl is prolly TIRED. Shit! I was tired after one jaunt of mighty skipping down my 150-foot hallway. Can't blame her.\n\nGo and check it out for production, lights, fun, etc. There's really not a bad seat in the house and you'll be able to marvel at Brit as an angel, in a ring of fire, floating\/flying off a tree and other spectacles.
