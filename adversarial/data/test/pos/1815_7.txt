Hooray for Friends and Family night!\n\nGreat grub, great company, great smells, great space!\n\nThe pizza was terrific, the scotch was a delight and the onion rings and fries are wonderfully crispy and soft at the same time...hard to do.\n\nI had the roasted chicken after making a pig of myself on the testing\/tasting stuff!\n\nGo...just trust me this once!
