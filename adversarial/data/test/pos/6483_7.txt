Firstly, everyone should know that Toby Keith has nothing to do with this location at Harrah's. He did sell his likeness to the group that does own this location. If you are looking for cheaper prices and a true Toby feel you should try the locations he does own in Oklahoma.\n\nI was told it would be about a 10 minute wait and they have some tables and chairs to sit and have a drink or just hang out while you wait to be seated. \n\nI ordered the \"Fried Chicken Salad\" and it was fantastic. It is so huge you can eat off it for 5 days! The ranch dressing was thick and delicious.\n\nI loved the country music playing and how other customers all sang along with the music together. When \"Red Solo Cup\" played everybody was singing and having a great time. They have many drink specials and for beer lovers they have special sizes just for you! With a players card I was able to get a discount off of my bill. If you want a good time this place is a must try!
