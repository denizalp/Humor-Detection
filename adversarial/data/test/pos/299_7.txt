I've been in jails and prisons all over the world. And I can tell you that CCDC is truly on the same level as a jail in a Third World nation. Filthy, inedible food, hostile staff. Not enough support personnel and 1980's phone system makes your stay 2-3 times as long as it would be elsewhere. Poor classification system results in high amount of assaults. Maybe Al Sharpton has a point about federalization of all law enforcement.
