This place was ridiculous for a number of reasons.  I scheduled my friend a fitting here on a Saturday at 3 p.m.  We got there early, but it didn't matter because as we found out, they do not do private fittings.\n\nThere is a small main room with 4 dressing rooms off it where brides can either select their own dresses, or have an employee do it (if they are available). There was a girl in there who had AT LEAST 20 dresses in her room, one of which my friend waited to try on and never got to.\n\nAll the sample sizes were at least a size 16 so you had to clamp everything, and they were out of clamps! There was no way my friend could have chosen a dress she liked based on fit.  There was a sales girl who tried to help us, but she was clearly overwhelmed by the commotion in the main dressing area.\n\nThis was just too chaotic for what it should have been. I wish we would have been told there were no private fittings. A dress we saw at Abotts in North Canton was priced significantly lower here, so if you are price comparing this may be a good stop. Just be ready for the mayhem.\n\nI
