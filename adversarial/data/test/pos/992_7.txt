Great prices & my stylist Ashley is the best! I have 2 sisters who visit from out of state & they always make sure to save time for a haircut from Ashley. Thank you for giving me great cuts for a few years now, Ashley.\n\nI'll never understand why women think they have to pay more than $13 for a great haircut. My style is pretty complicated & I've used Great Clips for maybe 20 years now. When I get compliments on my hair women will ask who my stylist is. I tell them & very seldom do they \"stoop low\" & go to Great Clips. The ones who have gone thank me again & again.\n\nCheck in online before you go & your name will be on the top of the list when you arrive. When you arrive it's then you request the stylist you prefer-if you have one. I've never waited more than 10 minutes when I get there & even without the online check-in the wait never seems longer than 20 minutes. Wow, they have great hours-opening early in the mornings.
