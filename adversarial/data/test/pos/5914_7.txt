Ah delux you little fancy hamburger joint, that must have a corporate account at Ikea or something because that place is chalk full of swedish furniture. Any how this place is pretty fun, its open till 2 in the morn which is a big plus in my book, the tap beer is extensive but in a beer snob way its kinda boring. It reminds me of the fathers office, I'm sure they ripped the shopping cart thing from them but its all gravy if you like fancy burgers at 2 in the morn than go getcha some son.
