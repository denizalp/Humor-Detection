AWFUL-- NOT CLEAN....the Free breakfast is a joke-  it shuts down at 9:45 because they run out of food... they Don't have much food to start with... We are a Diamond Hilton member and this hotel was awful, the bathroom was NOT clean, the beds were NOT clean...the hotel is worn out... I will NOT stay here again...
