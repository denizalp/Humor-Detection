Really great group of people that work here. The man who does the tractor rides (aka hay rides without hay...lol) was so kind. I think he may have been the owner. The selection of snacks are great & affordable. The play area is really neat for the kids! Everything was so fun for my 3 year old that picking a pumpkin was like an after thought!!! :) will definitely come back next year!
