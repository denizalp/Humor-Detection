I was so excited to try this place, what a disappointment.\n\nI found the prices pretty high for the portion sizes, and bringing out meals randomly whenever ready is not appropriate when you are having a nice meal with friends. My food came out before the appetizer, my husbands food came out when ever one was finished. You wouldn't have known it was even coming out because the waitress went MIA during that time. Took forever to get a refill on chips or drinks. Basically we had our food and drink orders taken and then the server came back at check time, thankfully other people dropped off food to ask them for salt and other simple requests.\n\nDon't know if I would ever come back.
