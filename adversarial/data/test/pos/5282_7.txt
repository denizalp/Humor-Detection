Tonight my wife and I went to the softy opening of this great new concept in good eating.\nI can honestly say that EVERYTHING was outstanding.  The food was fresh...hot...beautifully presented and packaged...and the price is more than right. \nThe place will open this Thursday and I can;t wait to go back.\nThe staff was very plugged into the heartbeat of the operation...and I will wager that the place is an instant hit.\nI had a 'Pellini' that was awesome.  I would imagine that there are (seriously) over a million different combinations of things you can create to individualize your meal.  Pasta bowl...Pellini....salads...\n\nLOVED IT.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.\n\nPS:  The previous reviewer that gave this place a one star...must be mistaken. They haven;t opened yet...so how could Rick M review it?  And..Pellini's is NOT a sandwich shop.
