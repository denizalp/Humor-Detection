I consider myself an expert in the delicate delicacy of POZOLE (having lived and traveled throughout Mexico for many years).  Given this, I believe I can say that the pozole offered at  Jennifer's \"The Market\" is as good as it gets.  You won't find better pozole in all of Guadalajara where this dish originated.
