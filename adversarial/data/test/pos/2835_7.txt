Most 'adult' stores (besides the magnificent Babeland in Seattle) give me the creeps. They're clearly marketed towards the male population as opposed to either a gender-neutral or female market. Sadly, they lose a lot of potential business that way.\n\nFortunately, for the ladies in the Akron area, Ambiance is there for us. Granted, they're not a female-specific store, but they are definitely a more welcoming store than the others. No garish neon lights, no shady 'viewing rooms,' and not in a 'seedy' part of town. This particular Ambiance is located right off Howe ave in Cuyahoga Falls (one of the nicer suburbs of Akron) which is both convenient and a decent neighborhood. \n\nThe store itself is well-lit, decent organization and general flow to the store. The staff is incredibly helpful and no matter what your particular kink or preference, they are very knowledgeable. \n\nAs for merchandise, they do carry a very large assortment. They won't appeal much to the fetish crowd, but they do have a broad spectrum from straight-laced vanilla to a chocolate sundaes. Highly recommend this location and franchise.
