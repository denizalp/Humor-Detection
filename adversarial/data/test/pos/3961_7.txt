Good ol' greasy chinese food. Pretty much what you'd expect from a \"fast food\" Chinese restaurant. Lunch specials are pretty good. If you're thinking of ordering รก la carte just opt for the dinner combos. It's a dollar or two more and you basically end up getting the same amount of food with an extra egg roll or rangoon. My kids love the egg drop soup & chow mein.
