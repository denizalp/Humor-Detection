Yes the rumors are true this place is closed I just had to see if for myself on my last trip to Vegas. I am so saddened by this you just don't know. I feel bad about writing this so late but I am pretty late on many reviews these days. \n\nThe food here was fantastic they made the udon from scratch and the service was fantastic. The portions were on the bigger side and for the price it was so well worth the money. Timmy and me are still confused as to how this place ended up closing because it was busy all the time. The owner's daughter did attend UNLV so maybe she graduated and that was the end of that.\n\nI will miss this place like crazy I have recommended it to everyone I knew that flew into Vegas and it was huge hit with the UNLV students. I will have to see if the one down in So-cal is the same owners but if you guys are reading this???? Vegas lost one of the best Udon restaurants around and many of students at UNLV miss you guys greatly. Best wishes to you all but if you choose to go back to Vegas PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!. I will twitter, Instagram, Yelp and Timmy FB the announcement. :}
