This is my third vendor I went after after attending the Yelp makers and bakers event earlier this month. They have special holiday lattes for the season but I decided to go with a holiday blend. I asked the man who waited on me about that burnt almond torte I had previously and he said the menu changes from day to day. They usually don't serve that. Bummer! Actually their selection of baked goods was rather poor only because I came in the afternoon and he told me most of the stuff was gone.\n\nSo I settled for a chocolate chip cookie. The place was somewhat packed but I managed to find a spot in the front. Most people there were using their laptops since WiFi is available here. The coffee was good-it was their strong one called \"the holiday blend.\" My chocolate chip cookie was also good but nothing overexciting about it. \n\nThis place is located on Penn Ave right near the center of East Liberty and near some construction. It is also a block away from the Hotel Indigo. As far as my beloved torte goes \"it went with the wind.\"  Will return only if I'm in that area.
