Looking to slip away to a quiet little tropical isle where colors of the sunset and cool, cool rum drinks surround? You won't have to board ship or plane to escape the mundane anymore, because there's a hidden harbor of tropical delights awaiting. In Squirrel Hill. What?! \n\nThis lovely little spot is called Hidden Harbor, a place sure to make all your tiki and tropical dreams come true with well crafted tiki and tropical cocktails and themed small bites that whisk you away to an island vacation, if only in your mind.\n\nA collection of top tiki bartenders (tikitenders?) create cocktails using the best of the best liquors and fresh ingredients. Wes, Max, and Greta (and sometimes Adam) shake up drinks like the Tropic Thunder, Fashionola Fizz, and the signature Hidden Harbor, to name just a few. Then there are the tiki drinks for 2 or 4...fun to share with friends for sure!\n\nThe kitchen was kind enough to adapt the pulled pork sliders for my gluten free needs by turning them into mini tacos on corn tortillas instead of the standard bun. Yum. You're gonna love these! My dining companion really enjoyed the sweet and smoky Chicken and Bacon Meatballs. Also on the menu are veggie tacos, ahi tuna tacos...and a selection of other tasty small bites.\n\nDespite the name, Hidden Harbor isn't hard to find at all, it's right next door to The Independent Brewing Company on Shady Avenue. (In fact, both establishments share the same ownership.) Make a point of searching out this \"Hidden\" gem of a \"Harbor\" the next time you find yourself in need of a quick mental vacation AND a damned good drink. Ahhhhhhhhhhh......
