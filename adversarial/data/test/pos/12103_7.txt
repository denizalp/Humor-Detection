I'm OBSESSED with this adorable little coffee + breakfast spot located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. I have had it bookmarked for so long and finally had a chance to stop in. \n\nFirst, it is a bit smaller than I had expected, so if coming for a meeting, I would make sure you're keeping it at 2-4 people. That said, the decor is ADORABLE and service is so friendly! They also have outdoor seating so it would be totally appropriate to bring your pup(s) along! I ordered their honey lavender latte with almond milk and it was so dreamy. It had a strong lavender taste which I LOVE. I also ordered their breakfast sandwich and you guys, it may just be my favorite one in town now and this is saying A LOT because I basically get one everywhere I go for breakfast. It had a fried egg, cheese, ham, tomato, avocado, arugula, and the yummiest aioli (see pic). \n\nI also think the prices are super reasonable for the quality of food and uniqueness of their beverages. Their hot teas come in little tea pots which is adorable. I'll be trying their avocado toast next time as well. I can't wait to come back!!
