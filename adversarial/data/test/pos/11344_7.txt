the rest of our group stayed at the bellagio, which was one room short - therefor my buddy and i found ourselves across the street at ph.\n\nbeyond being made fun of the whole weekend, i actually liked ph. the casino was refreshing modern and 'hip,' and the room was really nice.\n\nthe casino floor bathrooms were also super clean - and when you go on a 3 day binge of tequila shots and buffets...this is important.\n\nthe one major downfall was the pool. im no high roller but comparing the ph pool to the bellagio pool isn't even fair. i think my childhood neighbor had a cooler pool - and possibly better looking people hanging out around it.\n\nwould be fine staying here again - if i had to.
