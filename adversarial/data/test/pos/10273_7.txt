After reading assorted bad reviews on yelp I somehow lost my mind and decided to try it because I really wanted some Chinese food - when you walk in everything seems nice but not only was our booth about to fall apart but all of the food that was ordered for all four people at my table was completely void of any taste or flavor so much so that eating air would've had more flavor I definitely will not be back I gave them one star because I couldn't give them less
