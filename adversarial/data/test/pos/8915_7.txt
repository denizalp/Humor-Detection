Have you ever stayed at a hotel in Central America during the 80s?  Well, if you haven't, come over to the Cortez and travel back in time.  \n\nSure, it is $35 a night, but that is if you can sleep with all the sounds coming around and below you.  \n\nRoach hotel checklist:\n\nCrappy neighborhood (check)\nCheap rates (check)\nInsects (check)\nOld Hotel (check)\nTube TV (check)\nThin walls (check)\nMold (check)\nInadequate Ventilation (check)\nSecurity Problems - crappy neighborhood, cheap rooms attracts a certain type of folks (check)\nPlumbing Problems - water drain, shower pressure (check)\nTackle the door to open (check)\n\nTook forever and a half to check-in.  I slept with my clothes on.  The only reason they didn't get 1 star from me is because they are dirt(y) cheap, good location for downtown activities, and free parking.\n\nBut not cheap enough to attract me back.  I rather pay a few bucks extra and live the good life in Vegas.\n\nThe hotel is perfect for hooker banging and\/or drug deals.
