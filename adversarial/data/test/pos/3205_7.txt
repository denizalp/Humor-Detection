I present to you, \"The Ifs of IP\"\n\nIf you need a window or balcony doors that actually open\nIf you don't like flat screen TVs\nIf you like to buy Fat Tuesday before heading to bed\nIf you like to stay close to Hash House A Go Go\nIf you're taking advantage of the cheap open bar at Rockhouse, so you don't have to stumble far to your room\nIf you like a cheap and no frills room\nIf you want to be in the center of te strip and have everything in walking distance if your base command\n\nI'm sure there are more. Beds are more than okay, wish there was a thicker blanket though. Full disclosure: comped regular room.
