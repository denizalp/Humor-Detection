OMG - was this ever the perfect Foodie Restaurant.\n\ntrying to find a good spot i went to YELP, and this place popped up 4 stars, with 75 reviews....wow - i checked out the photos and was totally impressed. Called the restaurant for a reservation......nope, sorry first come first serve.\n\n6:30...ok, no problem, it's montreal - everyone eats late - let's hurry over.  At 6:55 we were standing in line to get in this tiny 40 seater restaurant on St. Catherine....hmmmmm.....can't recall the last time i waited in line on the street.  Felt like i was 18 trying to get into Le Ruisseau in Hull :)\n\nFinally at 7:30 we got seated.....at the bar.....a foot for the chef prepping the dishes....frick'n foodie heaven.  \n\nNow, i don't know my Japanese food, and i don't even know if it's japanese.....but oh my god it was so good.......check out the photos.......the food is as good as it looks.\n\nservice was super fast, friendly - and they need to be fast, because they people were stacked up down the street like cord wood trying to get a seat in this place.\n\nthank you, montreal yelpers for making my night
