This place is horrible! What is anyone here even being paid for? I call you and you say you'll call me back and never do! \n\nThey send these auto email job offers and when you reply with interest nothing happens! You apply for jobs on their website and nothing happen! No email at letting you know that they got your application or even if you did or didn't get the job...  Nothing! \n\nI see hundreds of jobs on their website and after applying and being ignored so many times, I decided to call them. And they say \"sorry we don't have anything\" so are all these available jobs I'm seeing on the website fake? \n\nSo after being ignored for over a year I found a job all on my own. \n\nThis is the most lazy neglectful staffing agency I've ever seen! This isn't even a staffing agency! It's a pure waste of time. I wish I could give 0 stars! They don't even deserve the one I had no choice in giving them!
