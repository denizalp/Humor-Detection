I'd heard a lot of good things about Paymon's from other Vegas locals over the past year, but unfortunately I'd never gotten the chance to stop by one of their locations. So you can imagine how happy I was when I heard there was a Paymon's opening down the street from my house. Finally a location on the southeast side of town!!! Their location is perfect too, right off Eastern and the I-215 which makes it easily accessible no matter what time of day it is. \n\nNow let's get to the most important part of this review: the food and the service. I must say the food here is exceptional!! I was with a few friends when we decided to stop by Paymon's after work earlier this week so naturally we thought it was best to order items off their happy hour menu and let me just tell you, every item we ate was fantastic and the portions were enormous!!! Plus, they have such an extensive amount of items on their happy hour menu that you can try a variety of delicious dishes without breaking the bank! I must add too that they have a lot of delicious cocktails on their happy hour menu (not just beer and well drinks). I tried the pink grapefruit martini which was so good that I could've easily ordered another round of them and not feel the least bit guilty about it!  The service was wonderful as well, we had made a reservation for 6:30, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us right when we arrived even though we arrived a bit earlier than our reservation time. Our server heard we wanted happy hour so she seated us in the lounge and tended to us often, making sure we got all the items we ordered and even suggested a few to try, which we appreciated since we were all Paymon newbies. I can honestly say I'm so glad I finally got to try this place and I will definitely be back for another fantastic happy hour date with the girls in the near future!!
