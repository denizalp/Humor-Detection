Face it, do you really go to Vegas to get a crepe? I didn't think so. You're probably like me and Jamie. You're probably staying at the Paris Las Vegas on a weekend discount package. You just saw Cher at Caesar's Palace and was wondering how a 63-year-old woman can have the body fat of a ten-year-old on a weight-gain program. As you come to realize you should go to bed with that question weighing heavily on your mind, you respond to a moment of weakness and come here. \n\nIt's open late, well late for me, not for Vegas. 11PM. It's fairly quiet at this hour with the faux-Paris hallway with only a smattering of drunken tourists. The main dining room is closed, so you just walk up to the kiosk and order. Jamie and I split a $8.99 \"Favorite\" which was all sort of berries hidden under a large folded crepe. Lot of whipped cream, powdered sugar and berry puree oozing all over it (see my photo). In other words, it hit the spot. We sat in the dining area adjacent to the place and were perfectly content to discuss whether Cher has ever ordered one of these. \n\nCREPE - 3.5 stars...no great culinary art but it does satisfy a late-night sweet tooth \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...well, it's Paris...sorta \nSERVICE - 3 stars...they're pretty much on autopilot at this hour so don't expect frills \nTOTAL - 3 stars...so I was hungry at 11PM...so what?
