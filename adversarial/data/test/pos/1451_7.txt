We came here for Amy's lunch time UYE, uh like forever ago. I just suck at staying up to date with my reviews. I have to say that I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. So I was pleasantly surprised with the opening week lunch $5 specials that were actually really tasty. I was in love with the enormous salad and pizza each for only $5. Unfortunately it has been so long ago that I don't even remember what they were. I really need to get back there and have something else. That way I can update my review with some spicy details. Yeah that would be better than just saying it was good. Hehe! So aside from the food itself the waitress was really great accommodating us quickly for our large lunch group. The only thing I didn't like about the experience was the music. It was garbage Kesha or something of the like. Note to self: bring them better music... \n\nGotta get back here soon!
