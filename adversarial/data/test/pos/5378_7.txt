I went with my boyfriend last night. It was my first time but he had been before with a friend.\n\nThe food was pretty good. However my experience here was greatly affected by our server. I unfortunately did not get her name. We waited around 5 mins to have someone give us menus after we were brought to our table. Our server came and started talking not to the both of us, but just to my boyfriend, completely disacknowledging my presence. She then comments about my boyfriend being damp (because it was raining outside) and touches his chest (not shoulders) two times. She came back again taking another drink order and touched him again, did not follow up if our food was okay and didnt check if we needed anything at all. I wanted to tell her to stop touching my boyfriend but I didn't want to make the experience any more unpleasant than it already was. Personally I thought this was an inappropriate way to behave in front of customers you are serving and to make them feel uncomfortable. The people working are supposed to be serving you and making sure your experience at the bar\/restaurant is as pleasing as possible not disappointing. It was my first time here and my impressions of this place is forever tainted.\n\n\n\nMaking reservation: \nI was done work at 9:45 pm which is a bit late for dinner but we wanted to eat nonetheless. I called around 7pm to make a reservation and the lady I talked to on the phone said it was no need and we can just walk in. My boyfriend called again around 9pm and they took a reservation for 2 people at 10:15.\n\nWe got there around 10 pm and we were seated in the bar area. It was raining out and the place seemed a little busier than we thought it would be. The space was a little crammed for our order which I guess was understandable since we were not in the dining section.\n\nWe ordered:\nMexican Streetcorn\nThe Brisket\nDuck Tacos\nFish platter\nA bunch of cocktails: Black Mamba Margarita and Manhattan\nBasque Cheescake for dessert\n\nMy boyfriend really like the brisket appetizer and we both enjoyed the fish platter and basque cheescake. The black mamba margarita is also pretty good.\n\nOverall rating for the food: 3.7\/5 stars\n\nThe place itself is aesthetically pleasing. High ceiling, spherical lamps extending from the ceiling, burgundy leather couches.\n\nWould I recommend this place to a friend? Probably, if they dont mind their significant other groped in front of them.
