It's like a supermarket for the United Nations. You will find anything kind of ethnic food here. The aisles are labeled by country or ethnicity. The market is predominantly Asian, but there is a good selection of Mexican, African, Middle Eastern, and Polynesian foods. The meats are good quality. There are cuts that are that are hard to find in most American markets. You can get fresh (still alive) fish and lobster. I am a big fan of the produce here. You will find a variety of fruits and vegetables like nowhere else. Everything we purchased was fresh and good quality.\n\nThe positives are that you can find almost anything ethnic here. The wide variety of items and brands.\nThe negatives, you notice a fishy smell when you walk in and prices are a little higher than the same thing somewhere else.\nIf I don't find it at Fry's I will keep going back for all those hard to find and specialty items.
