I'll be the first to say it: when I drove by, pulled up the rave reviews, and visited their website, I kind of scoffed at their claims of fresh-made pasta and sauces. Noodles & Co has been doing this for years, and we already have Mac Shack as a local version- same concept for all.\n\nBut my dinner here was really pretty great- I dig the modern kitchen decor, and the service is charming with a prominent Italian accent and genuine warmth. You pick from a variety of pastas and sauces, and add on apps, salads, soups, and\/or desserts if you so desire. Note that pastas and sauces\/toppings are priced separately, so this can add up- it's no bottomless Olive Garden bargain. \n\nThe mushroom ravioli ($5) was a generous portion of large, lightly-stuffed pillows. I opted for the pesto gorgonzola ($9), which was creamier than expected and quite rich. I would love to see them add a regular, robust pesto to the menu rather than just the cheesed version.\n\nWas a bit disappointed with the caprese salad ($11)- the tomatoes were underripe and flavorless, which didn't rise to the level of the the fresh mozzarella, basil, and other vegetables. I realize they're new, but until they can get a supplier who can provide fresh, ripe tomatoes, perhaps this should be sidelined or only featured as a special.\n\nSplit the pasta and salad for a large dinner, gave the rest to my guy- along with the complimentary bruschetta that comes with each order. Giant amount of food, total was just under $30, with tip. \n\nNOTE: The lunch \"specials\" offer very limited, basic selection. Hopefully they will expand what is covered in this category. I currently cannot recommend it as a lunch spot, despite working nearby.
