Shit show. Front door midget has a Napoleon complex. And $20 cover? Rip off. \"VIP\" lets you go upstairs whoooooo. \n\nOverall the music and people were ok, this coming from a straight guy in a gay club. Outdoor seating is kinda nice even though it's table service only. Music was decent, friend made out with a random couple but this place definitely isn't worth $20. Should be free for guys for once.
