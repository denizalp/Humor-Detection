This review pertains to lunch prix fixe for Restaurant Week.\n\nThe Skinny: upscale overpriced American comfort foods but doesn't deliver completely (3) service: upscale diner type service (3) value: expensive for what it is (2)\n\nMy hubby really wanted to hit Society Cafe this week for their $20.10 special for restaurant week. \n\nLuckily my husband being as astute as he is, noticed some wording on the menu. For the entree, the sandwiches are listed as \"slider\" (singular). When asked, the server did confirm that there was only 1 slider provided for the Restaurant week menu.\n\nDon't get me wrong but 1 slider\/small sandwich, a side salad\/soup, and three donut holes for $20.10? 'xcuse me... I thought this was Restaurant week, not Jenny Craig. Well, at least they threw in a couple of pretty tasty warm pretzel breadsticks with mustard butter but still. If  you ordered off their regular menu, the sloppy joes plus fries are only $14 - just saying.\n\nOkay, enough breathe and remind yourself that this is for charity. Breathe. On to the  food.\n\nAlthough it was nice to see they used real turkey in their turkey club sandwich, the turkey was rather dry. The sandwich was very unbalanced - too much filling for the size of the roll (1\/3rd an avocado, a large amount of dry turkey, 2 slices of large tomato, plus 2 strips of bacon all squished into a roll.\n\nSalad was on the sweeter side but tasted pretty good. Good for the price? Not really. But regardless, it was good. My husband ordered the soup which he said was okay, not great.\n\nThe warm doughnut bites were good but weren't the best doughnut holes ever. The outside wasn't crispy enough while the texture of the doughnut was tad too dense and dry.\n\nOverall, okay food, exorbitant prices. A 3 star review.
