Drove all the way there only to discover that they're closed even though the ad in Kijiji said they open at 9am today, as did the \"Contact Us\" page on their web site. And I wasn't the only one who thought so. At least 3 other people were outside when I arrived, all of them equally peeved. No doubt many more came during various times of the day. Fortunately I just wanted to pick up a box spring for a guest bed, the others were there to pick up Christmas gifts.
