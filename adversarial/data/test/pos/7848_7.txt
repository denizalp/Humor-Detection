They won me over, when I walked in, with the classic red place mats that explain the Chinese zodiac. I fully understand they have to cater to an all American clientele, so you're not going to be seated at a table with total strangers and they aren't going to bring you a whole fish and scoop the brain out for you to eat.\n\nComing off 12 years in New York City I'm very biased when it comes to Chinese food. Sam-Pan is pretty good though; it is totally Americanized (didn't even give me chop sticks) but the fried rice is not very heavy, the wonton was great and my shrimp kung pao pretty good. The hot sour soup was almost thick as gravy, sadly, but nothing a couple ice cubes couldn't fix.\n\nThe lunch menu is cheap: two lists of dishes for either $4.95 or $5.95. I'll be back again.\n\nUpdate: my friend Nicole writes to me on Facebook:\n\n''Jeez, is everyone in NYC like that? Like, \"Even though I'm a sophisticated New Yorker who eats fish brains every weekend, I deigned to eat at this little Chinese restaurant which caters to ignorant Americans.\"''\n\nWell, I should think not being seated with strangers and served fish brains would be a *good* thing even to New Yorkers! I meant no snobbery, really. I liked the place!
