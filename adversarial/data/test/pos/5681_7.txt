Maybe it was because I was starving that night, or maybe it was because it was actually just really good, but I had a fantastic meal here! We came in at around 11 or 12, I can't even remember! All I know is that I was having a blast in Vegas and I started getting hungry, and this is the place we hit up. We had the burgers and fries, and they hit the spot. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town.
