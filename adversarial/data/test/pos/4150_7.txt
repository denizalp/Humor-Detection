First time here. Service was good but food was terrible. Very disappointing especially taking into account the price. The pan-seared Cacciatore style calamari appetizer was \"fishy\" and not worth the price of $11. Our steaks were not prepared as ordered and the Prime Rib was very chewy. Would not recommend this place.
