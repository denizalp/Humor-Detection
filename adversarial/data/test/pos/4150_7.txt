The first step in addiction is admitting you have a problem. Happily, I travel often enough to enjoy Sprinkles at several locations. I was in Vegas to celebrate my best friend's birthday and was unaware of this location. I am addicted to Sprinkles. So much so, that I startled a young family on the monorail that was carrying take out from Sprinkles Vegas.  Apparently exclaiming \"Where did you get that?! \" is not considered friendly.  I tried to suppress my excitement and question the poor man.  Once he realized I wasn't drunk, he gave me directions.\n\nIt is located in the Linq, between The Quad and Flamingo. If you are on the strip, follow the signs toward The Highroller\/ Ferris wheel,  Sprinkles will be on the right by a fountain. It is about halfway down the walkway. \n\nBack to the cupcakes, I had heard about the cupcake ATM.  I was gleeful when I saw it.  Of course, I tried it. It is a little more expensive than the inside the store cupcakes.  The touch screen is easy to use and each cupcake is individually boxed and presented quickly.  \nI was on vacation and willing to pay for the novelty.... it is Vegas just go with it.  We also went inside. My friend enjoyed her cupcake and understood why I dragged her there. The quality is what I expected as our cupcakes were delicious.  I came back before our flight to get some to go!!  The ladies packaged them well for travel ( boxed and Ziploc style bagged). There is an ice cream shop attached as well.
