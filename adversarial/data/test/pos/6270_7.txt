They've slowly been trying to upgrade this place over the past few years but it still has that dirty bar feel to me. On my last visit here I was joining some friends that came for karaoke. The server was trying way too hard. He immediately acted like he was my best friend and started some banter and making some comments. Combine that with 20 minutes of the worst singing I've ever heard and I had had enough. I said goodnight to my friends and walked out.
