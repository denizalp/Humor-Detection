POORLY ORGANIZED and POORLY CONSTRUCTED NIGHTCLUB!\nWHY on earth would they make so many staircases inside a nightclub! imagine walking all night climbing stairs in 5 inch heels! There was absolutely no room for walking or standing, let alone dancing!  Rooms are SMALL. MUSIC SUCKED (house music).  I will NEVER go back to this place. I'm going to stick to our beloved XS bc they have never disappointed me.  DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WAIT 2 HOURS IN LINE TO STAND AND BE PUSHED AROUND INSIDE A SMALL ASS DANCE FLOOR! NOT WORTH IT!!!
