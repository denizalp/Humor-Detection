I have had Rudy's in NM, it was so good!  Pre-Yelp days.  I was excited to hear that they are in AZ.  \n\nThe lines at 5:30pm were already 1 hour+ long.  After you wait and wait, you need to find a spot to sit with all your goodies.  Got the 1\/2 lbs of brisket (moist), a little dry but the table side BBQ sauce fixed that up.  The 1\/2 lbs of baby back ribs = 5 ribs was dry and the BBQ sauce could not save that one.  The small order of new potatoes was really really small (about 10 small chucks) & tasteless and the corn on the cob was great.  The sweet  tea is out of this world.  And they forgot to give me bread.
