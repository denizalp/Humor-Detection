I swear, this spot has been two or three different froyo businesses over the past couple of years. This one doesn't really vary from the norm: about 10 flavors, a bar of toppings, a polite but bored teenager working.\n\nThe peanut butter and toasted marshmallow froyo flavors were decent. Nuts are in small open-air bowls with spoons by the register, possibly an allergy risk? Found it odd that whip cream was in a compartment in the condiment bar rather than in a can. Just not used to seeing that.\n\nCheap stop for a sweet treat. Customer service was pretty nonexistent. Second time I've been here and been the only customer for my entire visit. Decor is very child-friendly. I like the colorful spoon options at checkout, and they do have a loyalty card program.
