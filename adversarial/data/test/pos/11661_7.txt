Food was tasteless.  Potatoes came to the table looking like a soggy mess.  I asked the manager if he could bring out crispy potatoes.  He told me that NO, he could not, because the potatoes were \"pre-made\".   I am sorry, but any restaurant that is unable to throw some potatoes in a pan and crisp them up is no place for us.  We ate one bite of the other items we ordered, were very disappointed, and left.
