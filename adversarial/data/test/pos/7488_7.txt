I've been seeing all my Yelp friends review this place. Goodness I wonder how they have time to try new spots so quickly. The CA fire department should sign them up for forest fire season, cater it, tell them there's a new restaurant that needs to be reviewed among the blazing inferno while giving them a bucket of water. That fire would be contained in no time (especially if they got a 5 star review). Because we all know these people will go to any part of the city, ghetto or otherwise to try out a place. I am not that bold. I am just ghetto so I live there already. :p\n\nSo we finally went to check out the place on our way back from a new auto shop that we tried out for repair\/upgrade (review coming up soon). Since I am ghetto, I knew I could get there from Twain then Stober, cut through Joyful's rocky parking lot, while bypassing the traffic on Spring Mtn to get there. After all, polite drivers who let you into a plaza in Spring Mtn is as rare as a casino letting you actually win a jackpot). The exterior looks like the old place. I noticed that they spruced up this plaza from the old days when cardboard boxes were strewn everywhere (thanks to Hotai furniture up the block...BTW if their housekeeping is indicative of their furniture, I suggest you make your own cardboard furniture and lacquer it, it will probably last longer). They painted it and threw some sticks up to give it some flava.\n\nWe got the special that ends in August. Basically small bowl of pho and a drink or macaroon. I got the soda to tempt my hygienist and my other half got the macaroon. And then she drank some of my fizzy drink anyway. Bah. It's served in a can but they brought out a straw and glass of ice. Nice touch but unnecessary. We, hard boiled types drink it straight from the can and sometimes in a funny hat with straws that come up to your mouth (depending on availability and seasonal of course, come winter time, no one drinks from a summer Coke can....the can swaps to a polar bear or Santa...very important to denote the seasonal vintage by Coca Cola's standards apparently. But we need to swap the right can in that contraption or else we would just look pretty silly).\n\nWe both got the combo pho, flank, tendon, beef, tripe.  Noticed that filet mignon pho was on the menu for $8. Can't believe how that would come about but it's there. The soup was delicious. The meat and soup were lean and not fatty or oily. They brought out 2 separate plates of sprouts for us. Again nice touch. Usually I ask for my own. After all, they bring out the same size plate whether you are dining Han Solo or with another.\n\nService was ostentatiously attentive and friendly. Take that Pho So 1, No 8, or Kim Long. There was a time when No 1 had good service but I think they lost their way when their eyes were covered by bundles of cash and couldn't see how bad they were getting.\n\nEnough said. I hope D does not fall into that trap when they are as successful or surpass them. I hope they catch on and can upgrade to a soda ice machine. Those things do cost a pretty penny.
