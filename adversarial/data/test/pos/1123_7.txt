Well lets see. Hidden away like a crazy uncle in the attic. Inside is very elegant and charming. There's a small area for private parties. Plenty of flat screen TV's for sports. Full bar with super expensive poorly made cocktails. This reminds me of a singles bar, dress-code looks upscale. It doesn't have that \"lets hang out and have a beer\" feel to it- more like \"Sex in the City lets sip on the Martini\" kind of vibe. Too fancy for me really, I'm into the bar fights and breaking beer bottles on my bar mates head ;b At least this place is open late on school nights. But thats about all. :)
