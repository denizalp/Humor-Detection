At this gas station before you get out of your car you actually stop and think \"do I have any change in my pockets?\"  If you do, you make sure to leave it in the car because if something in your pocket goes jingle jingle at this BP the odds double of one of Cleveland's fine bums approaching you for bus fare.  And we're not talking about doubling from a 1% chance to a 2%...  we're talking like 45% to 90%\n\nIf you end up here, it's worth the drive down Chester to another gas station where it's only a 20% chance of meeting a bum and the gas is even about 10 cents \/ gallon cheaper
