I don't do my nails often, but when I find someone I like, I'm loyal. Unfortunately, the person I was visiting at another salon took an extended leave and I really needed to have my nails done before a trip. So, she recommended someone at Diamond Nails and I was confident about my visit.\n\nI made an appointment and indicated the specific technician. When I arrived, she was with another client and the receptionist told me it would just be a moment. Nothing unusual, except I ended up waiting almost an hour for my appointment. Why would I wait that long? Because the receptionist kept LYING TO ME. I would ask how much longer it would be and I kept getting the \"just a few more minutes\" type of responses. I assume a well-regarded nail technician has a certain level of expertise and that would would mean s\/he knows EXACTLY how long it takes to carry out certain services. Everyone knew it wasn't going to be a \"few minutes\" when I arrived. If the receptionist was forthcoming about the technician's availability, I could have made other arrangements - come back later or go to another technician. What made matters worse, my technician had finally concluded with her client, then the manager (or owner) pulled her to another client!!!! This lady was already with another technician for a pedicure and there was some disagreement over the quality of service, so she threatened to leave, but they persuaded her to stay with the promise of a better technician. Therefore, I had to wait for the completion of her pedicure as well. RIDICULOUS.\n\nThe tech herself was very nice, though she was really distracted and rushing because of everything that occurred and the fact that now her entire schedule was pushed back almost an hour. I felt bad for her because I knew it was due to scheduling and other obligations given to her by management (like the last-minute pedicure). Anyway, I had a special nail condition because of a previous illness, so I had an acrylic extension with gel manicure. I opted for short coffin nails with a thin gold metallic stripe and overall, it looked amazing. The issues: the thickness of the nails including some inconsistencies and a couple of the nails weren't straight, symmetrical, or filed evenly on the sides when creating the nail shape. Also, her acrylic or gel brush had traces of glitter, so random pieces of glitter ended up on a couple of my nails. It would have required re-doing the nails and obviously she didn't have the time, so she offered a discount on the nail design charge.\n\nI was content with my nails, but spending two hours in the salon for a manicure and the terrible customer service leading up to it is enough to swear off this salon completely!
