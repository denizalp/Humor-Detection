In class:\nThe class rooms are very small, and the class I was in was full so there were barely enough chairs for everyone. Its located in a scary run down building on the corner of Brimley and Ellesmere in Scarborough walking distance from STC. When I tried booking with two of my other friends the \"secretary\" I talked to gave me a hard time and all three of us had to call multiple times to confirm we were all registered for the same class. Classes were terribly boring, videos shown were probably over 10 years old (on cassette and mostly fuzzy) and they were shown on a very small TV. Their white board had many scratches and stains on it making it hard to read anything the instructor wrote on the board. If you think this was bad, its only just the classes.\n\nIn car lessons:\nThe instructor I had was different from the in class instructor. I had an older man named Rafi. He had a Toyota corolla, old and basically falling apart. Learning to drive with his car was probably the worst thing ever. His brakes would only kick in at the last second (so you'd have to press very hard and early) his door handle would fall off if you open it from the inside so you have to open the window and reach to open from the outside. His car was pretty messy to. He didn't talk too much while driving just motioned where to turn and where to park, but when he did talk his directions would be very confusing (if he wants you to turn left he'd motion left but say right). Also he would always be late for my lessons and one time he just never showed up at all! It was very frustrating. I basically learned nothing from the in car lessons aside from parallel parking.\n\nOne thing they failed to mention when I signed up for the class was that if you want to use the instructors car for your road test, you have to pay them $100 on top of the $275 plus tax (that's what i paid in summer of 2014) but they recently raised the prices. I think there was also a certification fee for the insurance discount. The certificate you're supposed to get, I never got. They said you have to go to another ministry to pick it up but they never told me where.\n\nOn the plus side I passed my g2 test the first time, but then again I learn easily. My friend however did not (her first time ever driving was with the school) it just goes to show how much you learn here.\n\nOver all I gave this school 1 star because it was a pain to book the classes ( in class and in car ), the car used to learn was falling apart, and they don't follow up with you.\n\nI paid about $400+ for 20 hours in class, 10 hours online homework, 10 hours in car, and the road test.
