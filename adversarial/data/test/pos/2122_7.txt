Went to nine inch nails concert on June 13, 2018.   No encore by the band ??? Really bummed out a lot of fans.   People weren't leaving.   No body knew what to do.   Really weird situation.   The joint is not a good place to see a show.  You spend a lot of money and they have no seats !! Standing only,  people push and shove.  No security.   Surprised it's not shut down by the Fire Marshall.
