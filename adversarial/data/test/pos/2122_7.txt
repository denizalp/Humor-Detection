Went there and received undercook chicken to the point it was still bleeding and slimy. The owner of the restaurant was very rude and didnt want to refund us, she said \"this happens all the time. She didnt even apologize not once to us and we were loyal customers! PLEASE DO NOT EAT THERE! YOU MIGHT GET SICK!!
