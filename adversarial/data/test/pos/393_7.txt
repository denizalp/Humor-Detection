Crown Bakery is located in Chinatown, on the 2nd floor of a building with other eateries located there. Their d√©cor is cute with kind of a warm, rustic theme. They have beautiful cakes on display in a glass case as you walk in and also all of their baked goods lined on tables and shelves in the middle of the bakery. They also have some tables and chairs available.\n\nIf you love French macarons, do yourself a favor and don't get them from Crown Bakery. They have them on display in the glass case in by the register and it should have been a good indicator of their quality that they were not uniform in size. \n\nI also tried the mini cinnamon rolls and was not impressed. They were a bit dry and the flavor was mediocre. There were many other pastries available and the prices were pretty reasonable. \n\nThe customer service was good but like my fellow Elite Yelper Rohlin says, \"You can't eat service!\" I will probably have to pass the next time I'm in town.
