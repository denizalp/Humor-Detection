The Dressing Room is now part of the Roosevelt Row family, and if you want to see plants, art, grab a cup of coffee, and fulfill a burger craving, The Dressing Room can help you achieve all of those goals as it's connected to Be, The Bosque, and Monorchid.\nDespite the small quarters, it smelt amazing as we walked in, and I knew right away I wanted to try the RoRo burger. I watched the grill as the gruyere cheese melted onto my thick burger and was squished between two buttery toasted English muffin slices. \nWith ingredients like porkbelly bacon and pink Russian sauce, my first bite was a culmination of delicious flavors. But soon enough, sauce, grease and all types of toppings were falling onto my hand as the burger was too big for the bread, and fell apart quickly. In retrospect, it tasted somewhat like a glorified In and Out animal style burger with fancier beef, and to clarify, this is a compliment, not an insult! \nFries were included in the meal and they were over seasoned and a little undercooked; the yellow aioli dip had a tang to it that I could live without, but all of this could be overlooked because the customer service here was friendly and attentive, so much props to the staff!\nI wish I could've stuck around to have drinks and taste the burrito, but try the RoRo burger if you're in the area and use your fork and knife to eat it!
