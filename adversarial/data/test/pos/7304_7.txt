The food used to be good and superb when I went with a Greek friend.  The service has declined over the years and up until the most recent visit it has very much so disappointed me.  Came here with a few friends and our bill was about $380 and we were left without a thank you for your business or see you next time.  These little things are what I look for in repeat visits at a restaurant especially where there are vast competitions with exact food on the same street. \n\nWe ordered a lot and the foods were ok but did notice the flavour has declined from before and our souvlaki was hard and dry.  The worst was we ordered saganaki (flaming cheese) and the gentleman lit the flame shortly before he even got to our table and just put it down.  Excuse me but where was our OPA???  I get it you didn't give two crap about our table but why the difference in treatment because I observed your attitude was 180 and friendly with other patrons.  Makes me kind of upset with their attitudes, didn't give any smiles or speak when taking our orders.  Almost felt like I was at a mute restaurant. \n\nThanks for declining business as we will be not visiting after 10 years of our patronage.
