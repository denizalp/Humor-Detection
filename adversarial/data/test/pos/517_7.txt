I thought this place was pretty cool and chill.  Love the little ice cream shop atmosphere.  I remember eating these from the ice cream man pushing his cart around.  I can't say I enjoyed them much when I was younger since I was chubby little stinker wanting drumsticks....Mmmmm -- think I'm still a  chubby little stinker minus the chub :)  I ordered the Mango flavored paletas -- chunky full of mango pieces and the ice cooled me down as I walk along the warm streets of downtown Chandler.  Great location and great dessert after eating out at the restaurants around! - Enjoy!
