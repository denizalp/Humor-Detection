Marc is awesome! I was so impressed with his professionalism and the high level of care he provided for my two cats. The photos, texts and daily reports made me feel so at ease and definitely made me more relaxed while away.  My little girl Ginn is normally scared of all strangers, but within days she was greeting him at the door! His prices are very reasonable, considering all he did for the cats. I highly recommend him and will use him again in the future!
