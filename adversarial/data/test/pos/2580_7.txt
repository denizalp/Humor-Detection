What a horrible show!  The real magic is the fact that this show hasn't shut down yet.  I mean, c'mon Criss you must be able to do something other than yell into a mike about drunk people (who clearly aren't drunk) and pulling doves out of your sleeves.  Also you need to work on the transition between your one or two \"tricks.\"  They were so obvious and BADLY done.  Also enough of the weird rabbits...they couldn't even dance in sync.  And Cirque du Soleil -- you just ruined your reputation by joining forces with this faker.  Where were the great acrobatics, the beautifully designed costumes, or anything resembling a Cirque du Soleil show.  Criss made inappropriate comments, is clearly full of himself (err full of shit), and the show was a waste of my time, money, \nwas boring and lame.  Seriously, this show sucked!!
