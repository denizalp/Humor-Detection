This place is pretty much a high end hair salon for men.  I told the front desk\/cashier person that I didn't care who cut my hair because it was my first time here.  It was cool that I was offered beer as I waited in the lobby for my turn.  A hairstylist by the name of Alex came to get me.  \n\nAlex was constantly distracted by his cell phone, talking to his co workers in the shop, screaming when there was a strike on television, and wasn't focused on the task at hand. It took about 30 - 45 min for him to finish cutting my hair, quite a freakin long time. I told him I'll come back in a week for a trim up before my conference.\n\nDuring my second week. I texted Alex in advance to let him know I was coming. He confirmed via text. I noticed that the previous client how he had built a good rapport with... However, when it came my turn. He was extremely cold to me. He wasn't personable and didn't really took an initiative to get to know me. He trimmed my sides so they were more defined. However, what really trip me up was that he charged me the same amount for a trim for a haircut. I questioned him about it and he said that's what it cost.\n\nAfter such a cold experience 2x time and charge for a trim the same price as a hair cut. I don't plan on returning back.
