For the price of the rooms, it really is just okay.  MGM and Mandalay Bay, which are in the same range most of the time, are a lot more enjoyable and have the same quality of rooms.\n\nI was there for a bachelorette weekend getaway a few weeks ago, and spent the whole 2-and-a-half days trying to keep up with these girls, clubbing 'til 4am and running around the casinos.  \n\nOn day (night?  middle of the night?  morning?) two, my feet really started to give out around 4:30am.  Shouldn't have worn those brand-new slouchy booties... but they're just so cute!  Anyway, every time the group stopped moving I'd slump into a chair at a nearby slot machine to give my feet a bit of a rest (I wasn't alone).  I got glares from staff every time because I wasn't playing, and a couple of times I had them approach me to tell me to move.  The first time, they pretended they needed to do machine maintenance.  Smooth.  Second time, they just flat out told me to play or get out of there.  \n\nThe place was empty, mind you, as it was 4:30 IN THE MORNING.  \n\nSo my also-tired friend and I split off from the group to head up to the room, where one other person was already sleeping.  We didn't have a key, and planned to just have her let us in.  Of course, then we ran into \"elevator security,\" the guy who won't let you past his podium without a key.  Back to the front desk to see if they'd issue us one, which of course they couldn't, as neither of our names were on the room reservation.  All of that is understandable, but what ISN'T is that each staff member talked to us as though we were 5-year-olds, assuming we were piss-drunk.  For the record, at that point, we were both sober.  Tired as hell, but sober - I had had one drink 6 hours ago.\n\n\nAnyway, enough of my rant.  I just was not a fan of the staff in the least.  I've stayed at at least six different hotels in Vegas and spent time in all of the casinos (never gambling, always waiting on others - and therefore sitting in slots chairs without playing) and was never made to feel so unwelcome.  I'm over you, Venetian.
