This was my first time here and I really liked their menu a lot.  If you order ala carte, it's a little pricey and you might as well order all you can eat.  Their burrito hand roll thing is AWESOME!  (BEST DAMM THING ON THE MENU) The service is just fine.  I did however find out that they are open til 2 a.m. (I didn't realize they were open that late though)  When I stopped in at approx 12:45 a.m. on Tuesday night to place a to go order, there wasn't a single person in there.  I was surprised because my other 4 sushi places I visit late at night always have a crowd in there late night. \n\nSo PLEASE people don't underestimate this place.  It's a good place, great variety and the quality of the sushi is good.  It's not great or better then any place else but it's good and I've been to far far far worse places.
