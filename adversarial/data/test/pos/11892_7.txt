Located in Mandalay Bay Rx Boiler Room is really weird.  Not normal in almost any way except for the food which is also not normal.\n\nI had a taste of their cheese board and the cheese was outstanding.  The standout was the blue cheese and the goat cheese.  I ordered a Cesar Salad and if you look at my picture it is not normal. I really like how they used the full leaf of the lettuce and just laid the anchovy on top.\n\nMy main course was a lamb shank.  It was served with Couscous with a slight balsamic vinegar taste.  Really a fine solid dish.\n\nOdd in that nothing matched.  Silverware, glasses, plates all kind of like the dishes you find in your home.  My water was served in a mason jar and my wife's was a wine glass.
