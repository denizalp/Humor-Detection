Zinburger = HANGOVER CURE!\n\nAside from that, the burgers are deeeeelicious and the ambiance is great as well. But let me start from the beginning..\n\nI wake up to a pounding headache and not feeling too hot as a whole..you know, when the thought of eating breakfast (eggs especially) makes you want to lose it. So, when my friend invited me to venture to Zinburger, I was excited. Not about moving...but about burgers. \n\nWhile en route to the restaurant, my friend calls and tells me that they have a Bacon infused vodka bloody mary and if she wanted me to order one. Ummm...YES???? Liquid bacon plus vodka in the form of a bloody mary? Mommy daddy...yay!!!!!! \n\nI arrive to this delicious beverage screaming my name, a sunny spot on the patio and just a prefect\/fun atmosphere. The bloody mary alone was to die for. I had to refrain from eating the glass...\n\nOn to the food..burgers...and lots of them. Not to forget the sweet potato fries and other yummies. The burgers were great. Maybe only us people, who are completely obsessed with burgers, can truly appreciate a good burger. Others should opt for McDonalds. I don't care what you say..you can taste the difference: the meat, the cheeses, the buns, the lettuce...everything. \n\nWhy the four stars? Because Delux still has the crown...
