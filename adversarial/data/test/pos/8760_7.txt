This review is for a Saturday night dinner service and not for their happy hour service.\n\nI guess I am definitely in the minority here, but I thought the best thing about my visit was serendipitously meeting Eric and Lisa R and having them join us for dinner. Beyond that this place had mediocre food and terrible service. From the moment I walked through the door, it was nothing but waiting.\n\nWaiting for a host\/-ess or anyone to acknowledge us or tell us to put our name down, etc. After being seated and ordering, it was waiting for my ice tea which came after everyone else's drinks were served and only after prompting the waitress. Then waiting for everyone's entree. I ordered the bun bo hue and green papaya salad, which came out in that order.\n\nThe green papaya salad had large, steamed 20\/25 shrimp, instead of the dehydrated small bay shrimp (which add additional saltiness to the dish). It was okay. The bun bo hue had a good, robust beef flavor and was not too spicy, but it was missing the pig hock and the pig's blood. When I asked if they forgot, the waitress replied they were out. Gee, you couldn't tell us that before we ordered?! You can't send someone across the street to 168 Market to  buy some? To add insult to injury, while waiting our waitress to refill my ice tea, I see a waiter carrying a pitcher of ice tea by, look at my empty glass, walk to his table to fill a glass of ice tea, and then walk away to set the pitcher down. Really dude?! I know we were not your table but I guess you would've died on the spot if you had filled, or even inquired about, another customer's ice tea.\n\nAt the end of the meal, after all the waiting, I could not leave this place fast enough.
