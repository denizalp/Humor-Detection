5 stars for the store itself. I love it and we are very lucky to have it in the 217 area.\n\nMinus 3 to the rude girl with a pony tail and dirty blonde hair working 11\/5\/2014 in the dog food section. Came in to inquire if they *by chance* had kittens for adoption and to ask if they would in the future as my grandmother recalled seeing an ad about in the News Gazette a few months back. It was a simple question and I got a smart ass look and comment and she reacted as if I was an idiot. Of course, referred me to the Humane Society, which is obvious, but how dare I ask or inquire about something to someone who works there?! \/sarcasm\n\nNow I don't feel like I can ask *any* questions there knowing that I'll be treated that way. Such a shame.
