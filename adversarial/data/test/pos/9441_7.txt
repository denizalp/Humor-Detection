When I reserved a room everything was clear, until I arrived. \nFront desk said I'm not getting any buy one get one free brunch, dinner specials which they told me when I was booking. They told me Mystery show is playing (representative knew I was booking between January 1-5th) when I arrived they said Mystery show is in a vacation and I left without watching that show. When I booked they said everything was working properly, unfortunately pool was closed when arrived. I told call center which I was expecting a mail when I was booking. Call center told me it's fine after they received they will give me. Didn't mentioned which I have to pay $7 handling fee. Front desk said after I arrived I need to pay extra because prices has been changed for holidays. You know that's not right. They didn't told me anything about that when I was booking. A lots of surprises which it shouldn't happen when people come for vacation from long hours distance. \nBeing honest this was worst experience ever I had. Call center needs more professionalism and they need to be clear what informations they are providing to us.\nImagine if I was coming from Japan only to watch mystery show and after I arrived front desk says it's not playing. How do you feel? Do you think is that right to play with someones money and time?\nI'm not happy with this service I received in my honeymoon vacation.
