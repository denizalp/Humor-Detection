Google maps said it's a 40 minute drive from my house (southwest LV), but I made it there in almost half the time. It was really easy to find and wasn't too crowded on a Sunday morning\/early afternoon. The little duck pond and waterfall is cool, but stay away from the geese! If they even think you have food they'll start walking towards you. And, don't antagonize them. I saw some kids chasing them. They may look friendly, but they do bite.\n\nThe play area is cool. It's got a dinosaur themed sand pit, swings, and some slides. The main playground equipment is a 4 level structure with many slides of varying heights. It's perfect for kids 5 and up. Not so great for toddlers.\n\nThe splash pad is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and it's on some weird timer that only allows water to come out of one feature at a time. So, each time the water would come on, all the kids would migrate to that one feature. It makes the splash pad seem more crowded than it is and with all the kids wanting to get wet, some of the younger ones were pushed aside by the older kids.\n\nAs far as Las Vegas parks go, the look of this park is very cool, but the splash pad at Red Ridge park in the southwest is better. And, they don't have the variety of play equipment that Exploration Park does (also in the southwest). Aliante Nature park is definitely worth a visit if you live in the area, but if you live further south, I would suggest trying out some different parks.
