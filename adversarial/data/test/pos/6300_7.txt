Let's be honest. It doesn't matter what I put because you'll still probably go here due to the aggregate score being very high and well regarded as well as people assuming my experience was an anomaly. Nonetheless,  here's my experience. \n\nI searched for a nice brunch spot on yelp and made my reservation at 9:50am for a 10:45 spot that was available via OpenTable. We got to the restaurant at 10:30 and checked in knowing that we were early and we would probably wait.  We were asked to sit and we patiently waited less than five feet from the two ladies that checked us in. (One was Filipino and the other seemed to be French) \n\nAfter we checked in a group of four came in asking for a table saying they had a reservation but both the Filipino and French lady said there was no reservation.  After some hub bub and complaints about not having a reservation, they were promptly seated. We didn't think it was a big deal they sat before us because we'd be upset too if they lost our reservation a d we didn't know if their misplaced reservation was before or after ours. Besides, we were early so it was fine. \n\nAfterwards a string of parties came, both larger and the same size as us with no reservations, and we're seated almost immediately. We felt that was strange and I walked up the two steps away I was to the Filipino lady and waited in front of her to be acknowledged so I could ask how much longer we would have to wait since it was now 10 mins past our reservation. \n\nWhen the Filipino lady looked up from what she was writing, she looked right at me, then looked beyond me to the line that was forming and stated she would help who was next. \n\nI was surprised that she looked right past me and the guy behind me came up next to me and said he would like a table for five. \n\nA bit pissed, I loudly said \"Excuse me. I'm standing right in front of you. I just had a quick question. Can you just tell me how much longer we have to wait?\" \n\nShe then asked me my name again,  when my reservation was and what time I checked in. She couldn't find the time I checked in nor remembered me checking in even though I was five feet from her the whole time. \n\nShe then called the French lady who looked at me and asked me what time my reservation was, what time I checked in,  etc. She also didn't remember me. \n\nShe also intimated that I had never checked in and I walked in now. \n\n\"I've been standing right here for over twenty minutes now, it's past my reservation time,  and you let three other parties with no reservations seat before us. I just want to know how much longer we would have to wait.\"\n\nThey kept looking at the pad and not making eye contact with me and asking what time I checked in,  trying to figure out if they had made a mistake or if I was lying. \n\nAt that point I was fed up so we left. The Filipino lady was totally clueless and I was getting tired and offended trying to prove myself to the cold French lady. \n\nThat was experience. Hope yours is better than mine.
