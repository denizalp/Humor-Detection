This place is absolutely fantastic. Music is awesome. Hookah is great. My boyfriend and I went here after being referred and we were completely satisfied. The new owner is friendly and really on top of things. His customer service was personal and made us feel welcome. His staff was just as lead from example. Not to mention the food is very addicting. I would recommend this place to anyone. The location isn't all that awesome but you don't really have a thought about it once you're inside and settled. We can't wait to come back when it's really going on the weekends.
