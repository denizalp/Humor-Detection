Very reasonable prices, decent AYCE spread with fresh foods and a good selection. Hard to find online (likely owing to the super generic name) but it's worth the hunt. \n\nSteer clear of Sunday lunch though. There's a church nearby and it seems the entire congregation heads here after the Sunday service.
