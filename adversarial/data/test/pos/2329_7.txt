Came here Sunday for brunch. Street parking....there's bound to be a spot somewhere...but whether if it's close or far, that'll be based on luck.\n\nThe atmosphere had a hipster vibe. A lot of people were on their laptops or reading a book. It was quiet, staff was friendly and the place was pretty calm and chill. Natural lighting filled up the room. Tables and chairs can be difficult to get if you come during peak hours. We took the last two empty seats in the restaurant located up on the bar top.\n\nI ordered the Hawaiian Benedict Sandwich. Came out pippin hot, fresh and flavorful. Pretty big portion too. It came with a small side of chips. Boyfriend order the sausage breakfast sandwich. He enjoyed it and honestly, I liked his a bit better. I wasn't a big fan of the over easy egg on my Hawaiian benedict sandwich...it was super runny. \n\nFor drinks, I ordered the macadamia almond latte that everyone orders. I guess that's their specialty drink, am I right? It was alright...not sure if the caffeine is strong enough because I didn't taste any hint of it. To me, it taste like almond milk, it had a thick consistency unlike most lattes. Boyfriend got this berry hibiscus looking tea. \n\nI've had Vesta bookmarked for a looong time and I'm glad I was finally able to give them a try. This is really a 3 1\/2 stars review. Everything was good but I much rather go to another breakfast\/coffee shop close by.
