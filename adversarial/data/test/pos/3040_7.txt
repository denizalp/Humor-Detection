I wish I could give less than 0 stars.  While walking through the Venetian, my friends and I got the eye \"treatment\" and were offered the products for $299.  Thankfully, we declined.  Within a couple of hours, all of our eyes were stinging and had some flaky residue.  We went back to our hotel just to wash our faces but the stinging continued.  The next morning, one of my friends had redness and swelling in the area where the product had been applied.  Fortunately, it was cleared up the next day.\nI can't believe this company is allowed to continue operating its business.
