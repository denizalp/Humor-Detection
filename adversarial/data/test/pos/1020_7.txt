Bought my car and get its service done here whenever the mileage hit the markers indicated on that little sticker thingy they put on your windshield... Now, I'm the type of person that needs and drives a car around, but really don't know very much about them. It's always good to have a dealer service department take care of your car, which is why I head over here whenever I need to get my oil changed and what not.\n\nThis review is mostly going to be about the service department, as that's where I go mostly whenever I'm here. Don't have that disposable income to be buying new cars all the time! The receptionists are quite nice, but their bookings always seem to be full. Make sure you are calling about a week before a date you want, or there won't be anything left!\n\nThe consultants that you deal with are awesome. Jeanette is the one I've spoken to the most, and she is friendly and efficient. They do ask you before they do anything to your car, so make sure you listen carefully and not just blindly agree. I've made that mistake before and had to pay for an alignment that I really didn't need...\n\nThe waiting area is a small and cozy, with couches for you to sit and enjoy some complimentary coffee or watch some TV (CP24). Unfortunately, they only have 1 area that includes an outlet, so not many areas to plug in. If you don't want to stay and wait, they have drivers that will drop you off somewhere to pick your car up later. I'm not sure if they also pick you up when your car is ready though...\n\nAll in all, a good place to get your regular car check-ups, if you drive a Hyundai. Anything else, I'd probably just find a regular autoshop\/mechanic.
