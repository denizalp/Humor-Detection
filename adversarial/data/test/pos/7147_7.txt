Meh. It's not for me. It reminds me of a fast food joint, but for donuts. \nThe atmosphere and product... guess donuts are fast food?! But I'm used to Glory Hole Doughnuts (GDH) where the donuts look like delicacies, an art and you can physically see the love they put into their d'nuts plus they're placed in sturdy containers, not a brown paper bag like Jelly Modern supplies.\n\nI went on National Doughnut Day. The guy behind the counter gave 4 people in front of me a free donut for the holiday, but when I reached the front, he didn't mention or offer me one. Thanks alot a$$hole! Those customers didn't even buy anything. You would think they would reward their paying customers a lil' something! GHD gave me 1 of their aprons for National Doughnut Day and they sell them for $30! Just sayin. (Thanks GHD! Love you!)\n\nI tried 5 different types of donuts:\n\n1. Banana chocolate chip - very sweet and tasted like artificial banana flavour and the chocolate chips are on top of the donut NOT in the actual cake donut. \n2. Madagascar vanilla - wayyyyy toooooo sweet! 1 bite felt like I was eating a spoonful of white sugar. \n3. Lemon curd - again, toooo sweet! \n4. S'mores - tasteless! It was bland and not even close to a s'more. I had no idea what this tasted like.\n5. Peanut butter cup - the best one I tried. It actually did taste like PB & chocolate.\n\nI was only able to handle 1 bite of each with the exception of PB cup. \n\nI'm not lying when I say, I feel like I wasted my money. Argh! But at least I can now say, \"Jelly Modern?! Been there. Done that. Don't want it.\"
