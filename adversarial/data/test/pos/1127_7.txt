Stopped in for desserts and coffee. Spent some time talking to the owner Sammy. Seemed like a very nice guy and we chatted for a good 15 mins.\n\nHe went on to tell me about the drama he had with Gordon Ramsey etc which def seemed to take a toll on his business for better and worse.\n\nThe French press coffee was excellent and the cakes were fantastic.\n\nGood spot. We will def stop back in for dinner sometime.
