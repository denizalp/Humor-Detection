Some time back, my wife and I were staying at the Rio, and went here for dinner, Tuesday night about 7 PM.  Walked in and was told that, since we didn't have a reservation, we would have to wait, which was cool with us.\n\nSo, we're in the waiting area, and we see two different parties walk out within 10 minutes.  Within those 10 minutes, we see another couple walk in.  I couldn't hear whether or not they had reservations, but they went right in.  After waiting another 5 minutes, I decided to just stand at the hostess station, thinking that maybe we had been overlooked or forgotten.\n\nOops, a family comes in (three small children and their paternal units), and gets seated.  I'm standing RIGHT THERE, no meniton of a reservation.  I walk to my wife, sit down, and tell her what happened.  I'm telling her that I'm ready to bounce to eat anyplace else, but she's pleading that we're already there, and to just give them a few more minutes ...\n\nAnd here comes the hostess, \"We're ready to seat you now.\" Really?  You mean a table just somehow opened up?  Would it be next to that lovely family that just came in?  Because I would love to use some colorful metaphors.\n\nBottom line for me was, the front of the house really spoiled my appetite. As the first person to greet your mostly out of town guests, why would you want to want to alienate even one?  Is the place really that fiscally sound that they can blow off customers?  Since then, my wife asked me once if we could go eat there but I told her I refuse to go back.  First impressions, indeed.\n\nYo cuz, mangi questo.
