this was an amazing experience that takes dedication, committment, passion and love.  Lilke a fine cook uses the freshest ingredients in their meal preparation, what you put into it is what you get out.  this was the most physically demanding, and mentally challenging event I have ever participated in.  In the end, it was all well worth it. In fact I look forward to the next one.  The event was well run and extremely organized. The crowd support was amazing and motivational.  I look forward to volunteering the future to help the next iron athletes achieve their goals.  the day was the hottest day in AZ to date at 95 degrees for the year and had 25 mph winds.  This made the finish line even more sweet.  of the 2035 or so athletes we saw a 19 percent attrition rate of people who didn't finish. this is one of the worst in Ironman History. This was no doubt due to the extreme weather conditions.  In the end of a race like this its not longer about time but rather finishing and pushing through the temorary hardships mentally and physcially.  I was so elated to have made it to the finish line I didn't even hear the announcer say my name.  However, it didn't matter. Embracing the medal at the line is like embracing your newborn at birth. You hold onto that puppy like your life depends on it and feel so relieved and full of joy that words can't even describe the emotion.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about embarking on an ironman journey to make the first step .... SIGN UP TODAY and good luck. Zack
