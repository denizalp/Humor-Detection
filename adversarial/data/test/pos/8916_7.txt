Time after time, terribly slow service. This past visit was definitely my last for quite a while. I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked. It took 40 minutes to get our meals and then the burger might as well have been hockey puck between 2 buns, because it was black and rock hard. If you're going to assume how someone likes their burger cooked... I wouldn't guess \"charred\" would be the correct answer. \n\nThen we sat with food on our table for another 10 minutes with no one coming by to check on us and no silverware. By the time they finally came over I decided I didn't even want the burger remade because my infant was getting fussy and I didn't want to wait any longer. \n\nThey took my meal off the bill but no other action was taken. You would think, at the very least, a gift card for a free burger or 20% off next time or something. I won't be back any time soon but, given the poor level of customer service, they probably don't care.
