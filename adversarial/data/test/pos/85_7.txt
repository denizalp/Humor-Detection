My go-to Far West Valley breakfast spot. First and the foremost, before we even talk about the food, the coffee is like a mule kicking me in the chest. SUPER STRONG and I wouldn't have it any other way. \n\nYou can't go wrong with the omelettes and various other breakfast fare. I recommend the Greek Omelette. Enjoy!
