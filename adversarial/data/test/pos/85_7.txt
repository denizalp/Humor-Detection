I came here with my little godson and cousins for the free holiday ornament-making event on a recent Saturday afternoon.  I can't believe it's taken me so long to visit this local, unique Las Vegas gem.  The ornament-making actually took place outside at the Neon Boneyard park, across the street from the museum.  There were staff from the Neon Museum on hand to show us how to make the paper ornaments, as well as provide all the supplies:  paper, glue, glitter, stickers, markers.  The kids and adults had fun being crafty together.  With the event starting at 3:00pm, we hung out and socialized until 5:00pm, when we were allowed free entry into the Neon Museum for complimentary hot chocolate and listen to Christmas carols sung by a group of students from Las Vegas Academy.  Part of the Neon Museum was open as well, so we were able to walk around and see some of the signs lit up at night (see pictures).  It was an excellent opportunity to see some of the site and introduce my cousins to the museum, too.  We all want to come back soon for the night tour, $25 regular price, $22 for locals and students, free for kids 6 and under.  I hope they have this event next Christmas!
