I've lived in Las Vegas going on 9 years now and have never taken the opportunity to go atop the Eiffel Tower. Well, I had learned a few months ago that you can take a ride to the top for free on your birthday (with valid ID). So, while playing tourist on the strip on my birthday, I decided to check it out!\n\nLocated inside the Paris Las Vegas(duh), you will find the entry way to the ride not too far from the Race and Sports Book. You'll take an escalator upstairs and as you're walking along the pathway, someone will try to sell you a souvenir photo. We opted out. I am local and don't need to commemorate my trip to the top. Also, I am cheap.\n\nAnyways, after reaching the end of the pathway you will wait in line to board one of the elevators to take you to the top. The day I went, the wait was roughly 10-15 minutes. \n\nWe finally loaded on one of the elevators and took the ride up. The \"host\" (or whatever you'd like to call them) was friendly and informative. She started spitting out these stats and info about the Eiffel Tower(both here and in Paris) that I'm quite sure she could recount in her sleep. She actually had some personality though! She wasn't robotic and just \"go through the motions\".\n\nOnce you exit the elevator up top, you are welcome to walk anywhere on the platform, which covers all sides of the tower. Of course, the most popular area will be right where the elevator doors open as it faces the Bellagio\/Cosmo area. It was kind of annoying never getting any great pics around that area since people would squat there waiting for the fountain show to play. So I opted to walk  around and check out other areas. You do get some great views of Planet Hollywood and the Paris its self. There are some great views of the north end of the strip as well, like Caesars and the Mirage and even the new High Roller observation wheel. \n\nThe deck isn't as high as the Stratosphere observation deck, but then again, you get a much better view over here! There is so much more happening on this end of the strip! This is something you should do at least once just to experience it.\n\nThey are open from 9:30am-12:30am Monday through Friday and stay open till 1 am on the weekends. Standard pricing is $10.50 during the day and $15.50 at night for adults. Besides the birthday discount, they also offer free passes to U.S. military also(with ID, of course).\n\nI went during the day, but I will definitely be back at night when friends or family visit just to take in the views at night! I bet that's a sight! \n\n4 solid stars.
