A hole in the wall Chinese fast food spot with some \"tasty\" options. Tofu dishes for veggie heads too!\n\nRyan C described this place perfectly, so check out his review ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/tasty-house-chinese-restaurant-phoenix#hrid:dPH4TU9Ys-04gmbkYPj5Yg ) to get a good picture of what this place is like.\n\nI dropped in for lunch today and was also impressed by the $5 lunch specials. Unfortunately, they had zero tofu dishes available on the lunch special menu (there are 3 or so tofu dishes on the dinner menu). I inquired about this fact and they hooked me up with a custom tofu dish lunch special deal! Now that's good customer service!\n\nI got the tofu with vegetables dish, which is some tasty thinly sliced tofu, deep fried and doused in a ameri-chino sauce. A selection of vegetables is also tossed in, with white rice and a veggie eggroll finishing off the dish. All this for $5.XX! Noice!\n\nI really dug their tofu dish and the low prices. I'll be back to try their other offerings.
