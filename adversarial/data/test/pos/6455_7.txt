First - A few things I think we can all agree on about the Fry Bread House (East)\n\nYes its kind of a hole.\nYes they are stingy with their soda (50 cent refills... really?)\nYes their staff can be a little....  independent\n\nNow something folks might disagree on about the Fry Bread House (East):\nThey serve the best fry bread on earth and deserves a 5 star rating even if they decide that folks in line need to be regularly beaten.\n\nI've had fry bread from all over this state.  You can get it at the state fair, various restaurants, roadside stalls, a yellow school-bus in the parking lot of Mazatzal casino, there's even a guy in mesa who sells it out of his driveway.  None of it compares to what they sell here - its just stunningly good.\n\nGet a \"Taco\"  for lunch and then get a sweet one for desert - you can buy em both at the same time they'll toss the desert one in whenever you ask.
