HIGH TEA!\n\nMe and my BF had comps for high tea at the Petrossian Bar, and I was so excited to dine here!  The restaurant is slightly raised (a couple steps) above the casino floor and overlooks the casino slot machines.  Haha, an interesting view, but you do get a lot of feet traffic and I freaked out when I saw Kourtney Kardashian, her mom, and BF Scott Disick (as a Kardashian fan, I had to throw this in here haha).\n\nFirst we chose our tea from a nice selection.  I had jasmine and my BF had earl gray.  They were both loose teas so we were equipped with fancy silver strainers to make sure the leaves didn't get in our cups!  Talk about fancy!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/petrossian-bar-las-vegas?select=4B5Ec4VTXty--_Vco9njNw#4B5Ec4VTXty--_Vco9njNw\n\nWe got to choose four finger sandwiches each.  Between the two of us, we had:\n\nSmoked turkey, brie, and black grapes on cranberry bread\nBayonne ham and gruyere cheese, dijon butter on rye bread\nClassic egg salad, topped with quail egg on white bread\nAlaskan king crab salad, avocado on brioche\nSmoked salmon topped with transmontanous osetra caviar on pumpernickel bread\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/petrossian-bar-las-vegas?select=LugPdrVwQQ9EkVVFf9hAlA#LugPdrVwQQ9EkVVFf9hAlA\n\nThe sandwiches were probably only about 2\"x2\" at the most, but so DIVINE!  Every bite was the perfect taste and texture and so satisfying for such little bites.  Somehow everything tasted buttery and rich, in a decadent way.\n\nWe also got a few desserts with our high tea tower: mini cheesecake, fruit tart, and a lemon tart cake thing, but I didn't eat any of it (I'm not a sweets person).  My BF said the cheesecake was delish though!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/petrossian-bar-las-vegas?select=LugPdrVwQQ9EkVVFf9hAlA#F_Ecvp70fDUuEzIViZ6KhA\n\nWe also got two cranberry scones each, served with lemon curd, cream, and butter.  They came out PIPING HOT (=fresh?)!  Very good for scones (I generally don't like scones) and more light tasting than ones I've tried.  As the meal went on and we focused our attention on the sandwiches, the scones got hard and less pleasant to eat...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/petrossian-bar-las-vegas?select=LugPdrVwQQ9EkVVFf9hAlA#NydVYplRPn_PmSG2ct3M7g\n\nI figured since it was high tea aka dainty small sandwiches and scones, it would be a pretty light meal, so I made the reservation for 2:30pm as a sort of interim meal between brunch and dinner.  But WHOA that meal was so filling!  We ended up having to push back our dinner reservations by almost two hours!\n\nAll in all, a great experience, especially for high tea lovers like me!  One of the best high tea places I've been to!
