I will keep the quick tip recommendation short.....\n\nHungry? Just go here.  It's one of the better buffets on the strip.\n\nI will spend a little more time talking about my general take on it.\n\nLOCATION:\n\nThe Wynn casino seems a bit further out (especially if you are walking around) from what I call the \"heart\" of the Vegas strip (Bellagio, Ceasers, Paris) so if you are closer to the Bellagio, then I really don't think there are that many differences when it comes to the food.\n\nWhat is nice about the Wynn is that I think that there is generally less traffic at the Wynn compared to the Bellagio and the buffet location is tucked away further from the casino floor traffic.  This isn't to say that there isn't a line, but there are few casinos that don't.\n\nFOOD:\n\nMulti national cuisine (but it slants on the side of having a lot more Asian dishes). but there are enough options for even the most picky eaters (meat and potatoes kinda people).\n\nDesserts are fancy to look at and don't be ashamed that your plate has 6 types of desserts.....EVERYBODY is loading up.\n\nCATTLE LINE?:\n\nUnlike the lines waiting to get into the buffet, you don't necessarily feel that way when you go to each station to get your food.  It's pretty open and I never feel like I am queuing up.\n\nWANNA EAT CHEAP?:\n\nWorried about how much your meal is going to be and feel like winning some money that will take less than 3 minutes of gambling time (minus the cash out at the casino cage?)\n\nForget the slots, forget blackjack....I'm talking QUICKER....your are frickin' hungry, man.\n\nHere is what I usually do.\n\nGo to the \"money wheel\" on the casino floor. \n\nPut $20.00 on number \"1\".  Win?  Get 20.00 bucks profit.\n(it usually hits more often than not.  You get even money back.  Don't focus on what you could win, you goal is to double up your money).\n\nLose?  Put 40.00 down and go again.\n\nBam....your buffet is now half price!\n\nWanna get your buffet for free?  \n\nPress you bet on 1 again.  Win?  You got your meal paid for, son.\n\nThere you go...you either saved 50% or a full 100% of your meal ticket.\n\nIf you strike out, don't worry...you were gonna blow that money anyways.  \n\nThe upside is that it will give you even more motivation to eat as much as you can to get your money's worth.
