The entire east side east of i271 seems nearly devoid of any Mediterranean cuisine, which is sad. Taza fills that void with delicious kebabs that would \"skewer\" the competition. Wait, there is none. Oh well, order the hummus, baba ganoush, various wraps and appetizers. They have a delicious garlic mayo condiment that's similar to Nate's, but be warned, it's intense enough to stay on your breath for a few days and yet still remain effective enough to kill a few vampires. 4 stars!
