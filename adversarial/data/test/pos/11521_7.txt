Stayed here for a two nights with a few friends. We were looking for cheap options to crash for a few nights, and this seemed to fit the bill. The location was incredibly convenient. \n\nThe check-in\/ check-out line was absurdly long. For how many people were working at the front desk, it seems that the line should have moved at least 6 or 7x quicker than it actually did. Not sure what the holdup was, but from the lady's expression, this seemed to be normal. Yikes. \n\nOur room was decent- not quite up to what I would consider normal hotel standards, but it was alright, because we really were only looking for a clean place to rest our heads. The room was lacking almost all amenities. Very different from what we saw online when booking our room. Updates haven't been made here in quite some time and it is VERY obvious. \n\nIf you are comparing places to stay and you have other options, I'd say go with those other options. Unless you're willing to fork out a lot more money for an actually nice room.
