As part of my birthday celebration, my husband made dinner reservation in advanced, in hope to give me great experience. \n\nLawry could easily have at least a solid 4-star. As we arrived last night, the valet gentleman was very friendly and advised where to self park (velvet is complimentary); he even opened the front door for us as we were walking toward the door. \n\nNow you might think why 3 stars? Well, when we arrived at 6:40 for our 7pm reservation, the male host did not even give us eye contact at first, he was looking down when saying his \"hi\"; after we told him that we have dinner reservation at 7p, another couple walked in, the host then asked us to wait for a moment. Another gentleman came to guide us to our table; while the restaurant was half empty, he gave us this corner L shape tiniest seating. For a moment there, I was thinking maybe it's because we were small party, then we looked around, there were many party of 2 were seated at the larger booths by the wall.\n\nAs much as I hate to use the word \"racist\", they made me feel like they were because the couples seated at the larger booths were Caucasians. About 30 seconds later, we also saw the host personally escorted the couple who walked in behind us (Caucasian) to one of the larger booth by the wall. \n\nI was unhappy that we were the only ones who were seated at end table when the restaurant was half empty and we had reservation; in fact, we were the only ones seated at that session. Call it racist or special treatment if you would, but this was unacceptable; we were just going to leave, fortunately our server Ashley made the change and had us to be seated at one of the larger booth. Throughout the dinner, we also noticed the host only escorted people who were not Asian, he asked another gentleman to take all Asian customers to their table. I was very confused, because he was Asian himself, why treated Asian differently?  \n\nNow on to the food; we ordered 2 prime ribs, 3 lobster tails, mushrooms, creamy corns, and a bottle of Cabernet. The prime rib was cooked to perfection, every bite was juicy and savoring; we added the lobster tails to make like surf and turn, the lobster were fresh and good as well. \n\nOur server Ashley was very friendly, patience, paid attention to details and very professional to explain the history and menu. At the end of the dinner, I only ordered espresso but Ashley surprised me with a red velvet cake for my birthday. As we left, the same velvet guy said good night to us with a bright smile; we tipped him for his friendly attitude.\n\nOverall it was a great experience; if it was not the host, I would have given 5 stars.
