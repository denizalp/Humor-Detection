I'm not sure if this was a fluke or what but our experience here wasn't really good at all.\n\nActually the food itself would get a solid 3 stars but service where it all fell apart!\n\nFirst off I admit, I never like to eat in a residential house converted to a restaurant unless it's been totally redone, which is unfortunately not the case in Planeta Mexico's locale. The conversion isn't the best as the raised level dining area and a very residential bathroom don't really lend themselves to a commercial eatery but I guess some will give it a \"cute\" factor of sorts.\n\nMain problem is no one here apparently been trained to wait tables! Don't get me wrong, they are all nice, pleasant people but:\n\n- Orders came at different times.\n- Items were missing.\n- No one ever checked on us to see what we need or refiled drinks.\n- No uniforms, each person is wearing whatever they please.\n\nThe biggest issue was when they moved us mid meal to make room for a group booking! Tip: If you know you have a group booking, get your dining room in order and block tables ahead of time. \n\nThey first moved us to a corner and blocked us with all the tables for the group with literally no way to get out easily without disturbing a bunch of people! Seeing this, I asked them to move us somewhere where we could at least get out which they obliged. The gentleman who I believe is the owner (based on the Yelp photos) was present and helping his staff rearranging the tables but never bothered to come over and apologize to us.\n\nI thought this was annoying but when that poor group showed up, they crammed two extra chairs at both ends of the long chain of 4 or 5 tables to manage to accommodate them! That's sharing a 2 person table (Which is on the  smallish side already) between 3 people! It looked so horrible I actually felt pity on whoever made the booking and couldn't help but chuckle at what awaited them service wise.\n\nNote to the owner: If you're reading this, and if you care about your business, please hire professional staff and not your family and friends! Your food is good, even if your location is a bit awkward but you must have proper service to go along with your food! Watch some Restaurant Impossible and you can indeed improve this business and bring in even more revenue. Last but not lease, if you inconvenience guests to accommodate additional business, at the very least you should come over and explain why you're doing so and apologize for the interruption.
