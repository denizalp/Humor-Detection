I had this dream where a guy who looked a lot like Will Smith from Men In Black kept telling me to pick up the phone. Except there's no phone around. I'm in like a doctor's waiting room. I don't see any doors, it's  just some chairs and a coffee table. He starts yelling at me to pick up the dang phone. I'm like \"Dude what phone? I loved you in Fresh Prince of Bel-Air but there's no phone!\"\n\nSo I'm like looking around and under my chair is the phone. It's that toy phone like from the Powerpuff Girls. It's not ringing but I pick it up. I put it to my head but I don't say hello, I just listen. There's a faint rustle, like autumn leaves blowing down a lonely road. I put the phone down, but the sound doesn't stop. I keep looking for the source of the sound and I can't find it. It's not coming from the chairs or the table or any of the weird magazines lying around, but it keeps getting louder and louder when suddenly...\n\nI wake up in a jolt.\n\nMy girlfriend is standing over me. She's rubbing together two pieces of seaweed paper. A little bit of drool dribbles out of the upturned corner of her mouth and she says, in a hollow and dangerous tone, \"suuuu... shiiii...\"\n\nSo yeah, it's pretty good and on Mondays they have buy one roll get the other one for $1 (it's a limited selection for the dollar rolls).
