I'm a fan of Kahnawake and supporting places here\nWould love to give this 5 stars, but really can't, that is clear\n\nI've been here twice, both for birthday partys \nAnd while the first visit was great, the second was shoddy \n\nTaxes are included so the price isn't that bad \nBut some of the items prices made me quite mad\n\nThe first time I came, I had the avocado salad \nWith goat cheese and chicken so satisfied my palate\n\nUpon my return they now charge four dollars more\nAnd less of the quantity they offered before  \n\nSo on the 2nd visit I ordered some tacos\nServed with moldy cheese- which was quite the shock-o! \n\nWe had waited so long for the food to arrive\nI scraped off the cheese and scarfed all 3 live!\n\nI did let them know, and they ended up comping my plate\nAnd the fried dill pickles I also ordered were absolutely great\n\nThe service was long, but friendly at least \nStill part of the reason my opinion decreased\n\nThat and the cheese because c'mon man, that's lame\nTo serve rotten food even when comping it, is a shame\n\nBut it's nice and it's cozy with its' wooden decor\nSo I'd be willing to come here at least just once more\n\n-------- Installment 31 poetry reviews \n\nI want to like this place more, but I can't. At first they tried to still charge me 1\/2 price for the tacos since I ate them... But i was starving by that point! I didn't argue or say I was upset and our waiter said they decided not to charge at all for the tacos (I still paid for my wine and fried pickle side, which I agree with) before bringing our bills, so ultimately I decided it is worth giving them another try. \n\nBut I still can't give them higher than 3 stars for now. 'Cause...why and how was the cheese moldy in the 1st place...and how did it end up past several employees and in front of a customer? And how could you even fathom charging me at all for it? And why didn't the manager\/owner or chef come to apologize? Though I appreciated how our waiter handled it it wasn't his fault or responsibility to deal with that.\n\nAlso I found the price increase on the wine to be quite exaggerated. (When you charge me more than half the price of the bottle itself at the SAQ for 1 measely cheap pour glass...no. You upset me.) Not to mention the selection limited and poorly chosen for a steak house (with a few exceptions, I'll admit). \n\nBut damn, those pickles were good! X-D
