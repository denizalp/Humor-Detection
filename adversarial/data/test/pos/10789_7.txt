My first Poutine in canada!! I got the bacon cheeseburger artery clogging beast, but what a tasty fucker this was.  This thing was just curds, fries,  grease meat, gravy piled high. If this thing didn't have the potential to kill you I would totally have one a day. \nPRO TIP: try it but get a small one unless you have magical unicorn diet pills
