***Biltmore Fashion Park features a small selection of upscale clothing stores and shops like Pottery Barn; there is nothing here that is really interesting though the chocolates shop looked nice; there is a variety of dining options from upscale chains like The Capital Grille and major, moderately priced chains like California Pizza Kitchen to more local places like Zinburger (a local burger chain)***\n\nBiltmore Fashion Park has its own parking lot--both valet and pay self parking are available.  At least some restaurants (like Zinburger) validate parking (Zinburger validates up for 2 hours).
