I heard of this place on Groupon, which has a 20% cash back deal. I didn't realize it was in the same plaza as Chanpen, so after dinner there I stopped in here. There wasn't any customers when I walked in after 7pm and the owner greeted me. I told her it was my first time and asked if they had other locations, she said her other store is in Chandler but with Bosa Donuts nearby, the competition has been tough and sales have suffered. She had a positive demeanor though and was nice.  \n\nI got a small Thai iced tea and upgraded to the larger size when I was told that there's a $0.35 surcharge for credit payments under $3. Inexpensive drinks here and I was too full to consider buying donuts. My drink was okay, the flavors of the Thai tea were fine but the boba was too soft and flavorless for my liking. Also I'm picky and like the sealed lids, and this was just a regular plastic lid. Can't comment on the donuts but maybe next time!
