In 2002, we lived at The Grand Hotel and Suites for 5 months. The hotel did accommodate us by converting a second bedroom in our suite into a dressing room, where we stored our clothing, albeit on clothing racks; intimates in armoires.\n\nThe hotel staff was very helpful, but we didn't appreciate the cleaning staff asking if we were selling clothing. It just bothered me that they did not mind their own business. I would ask them to stay out of the second bedroom, unless I was home and required they enter to vacuum and dust (while I was present). Furthermore, I would post a tag on the door knob requesting they stay out of our dressing room, but that didn't help. One day, someone entered our dressing room and broke a very expensive bottle of perfume--now there is no way they could claim they weren't in there.\n\nAnyway, I did not often venture by foot on Jarvis Street because on a number of occasions, I encountered shady characters, who always seemed to know I was venturing out. Others liked hanging out behind the hotel (next door are a couple of not so desirable venues). Oftentimes, while in my car on my way into the garage, I would find strange females trying to hail me to stop and \"chat\". Uhhh, I didn't think so.\n\nAs regards amenities, the workout room was nice; along with the indoor swimming pool (I doubt things have changed much). We did not ever use the hot tubs on the roof, but they are there.\n\nOther than that, it is nice for extended stay. A bit of advice, have your own car or make arrangements for a drive to the heart of the Yorkville District or beyond; and back to the hotel. It seems if one is a runner (athlete) and is actually running, one is not bothered by passersby on Jarvis Street\/parts of Yonge Street\/parts of Bloor Street. However, if one is walking, one may be made to feel uncomfortable by the many peddlers on these streets.
