How come the reviews of Grumman78 are so divided?! It seems that people either love it or hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter category.  The fried chicken was dry and crumbly and tasted horrible. Nothing about it worked. The tacos we ordered were ok. They were not remarkable (I make better at home). The food was just no. The prices too expensive for what it is. The service was slow and cold - I felt like we were bothering the waiter by asking if we could place a drink order. We waited and waited and waited some more for a waiter to come take our food order. We ended up leaving after appetizers and the first round of drinks because we were hungry and thirsty. The service is a fail - I don't care how slouchy the waiter's smurf hat is or how many tattoos he has or what band is on his shirt. FAIL. We went down the road to another restaurant that was more than happy to take our money.
