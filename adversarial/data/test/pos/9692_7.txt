I came here about a month ago and Matt was super nice at the front desk, I think if anyone else had been working I probably would not have committed. He offered a free training session with someone the next day so I took him up on that offer. After being stood up, the manager, took me in his office for about a half hour and talked a whole bunch of shit. Basically he told me that I was fat, I have no idea what I'm doing and I need to be in the gym 6 days a week. After meeting with him I though that I should try meeting with a trainer again. Well I changed my mind and when I called out of courtesy to cancel the girl was a total bitch on the phone. So the next day I see Matt and I told him what happened, and he talked with me and apologized for it all. It helped to get some of my anger out but I still that one douchebag around and I even walked passed him the one day and asked when I was rescheduling. I said I'm good, and walked away. I hate everything about this place. But there is nothing cheaper. or closer for that matter
