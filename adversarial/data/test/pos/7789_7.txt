I haven't Yelp'd in a while.  However I was trekking to the dreaded suburbs to meet friends for dinner and I wanted to see if there was anything new and locally owned and came across reviews for this place,  some were so scathing I knew it was the place for me to try.  \n\nI have been in and out of the service industry for decades some of these reviews were either written by former or current employees who simply do not like change.  With that said, here is my honest unbiased review.\n\nThe food was good, the pizza was good, the service was good.  It is a new family owned restaurant, give the growing pains a chance to subside.  I had a memorable experience and I will go back infact it was so memorable we are having my sisters rehearsal dinner there.  It was fun the staff was overly attentive sometimes good sometimes bad but we definitely knew they were there weather we wanted or not.  Our water glasses and soda were so over filled we practically floated out of the place. \n\nWe were greated with a smile, we were thanked with a smile as we left.  What more can you ask for.\n\nI like it better with out of the pretentiousness of the Tutti Santi name it is more relaxed and just a little bit more fun.  \n\nThe guy with the obvious north east New York \/ Jersey accent was hilarious everytime he talked I lost it.  \n\nThank you again for a good time I hope we get to the GREATNESS level
