I ate here for dinner with my husband.  We are visiting Scottsdale from Chicago and we had a fantastic experience.\n\nBoth Sammy and Amy were very sweet and accommodating.  Our food came out in a timely fashion.   Sammy asked us how our food was tasting every time we got a new dish (we got drinks, an appetizer, entree, and dessert).  Really great service and they obviously really care about their customers and their experience.\n\nAll of the food was so good!  I absolutely LOVE Italian food and this is the best italian I've had since I got to AZ! \n\nWe got the flat bread for our appetizer and it was nicely seasoned and garlicky!\n\nMy husband ordered the Sweet and Spicy Pasta Rustica.  My husband LOVED his dish.  I got  the tomato basil gnocci and it was delicious!  The home made sauce was so good!\n\nWe both got dessert and it was very rich in flavor and taste.  It was a very sweet ending to a great experience. \n\nOverall the ambiance was nice and the prices were reasonable.  \n\nWe will DEFINITELY be coming back!
