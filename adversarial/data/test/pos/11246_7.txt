We rarely venture into the Old Town area. And honestly, with wood-fired pizza restaurants currently opening up like corner gas stations all over the damned city, the only reason I even took an interest in Craft 64 is because of the chef. Horacio Hernandez runs the kitchen - or at least he did initially. Not so much anymore. If you didn't know, he's the former right-hand man of some dude named Chris, who just so happens to make what many say is the best pizza in the entire country! \n\nThey have a pretty extensive locally crafted beer list, which I'm sure will please many people that are into that scene. It's their gimmick. I don't like beer, so I'll leave those opinions to the craft beer connoisseurs. \n\nDuring our first visit, we had their charcuterie board, featuring some bread with olive oil, a couple of cheeses, grapes, nuts, seeds, soppressata and chorizo.  Everything on the plate was very fresh and tasted great. The bread, however, which is free, is pretty standard-fare in comparison and is starkly different than the bread used for the bruchetta. During a return visit, they've modified the board to include a bleu cheese. We asked the server if they could substitute it out due to our mutual hatred of bleu cheese - which our server didn't seem to really understand. He said that's all they had, which kind of made no sense, considering they have a variety of cheeses back their used to make their food. Instead, we ordered the mascarpone and fig paste bruchetta, which was actually one of the best things they offer. \n\nFor pizzas, we've had their margherita (or margarita in their case) as well as a FICO, due to our intense love of either figs and\/or fig jam incorporated into a pizza. We requested that they hold off on the truffle oil, which one would think they'd know better. Additionally, we've also tried their Spain, which seems to get rave reviews on Yelp.\n\nHonestly, I don't know. Aside from the chorizo, the Spain tastes kind of bland. The mild harrissa sauce is no substitute for a great tomato sauce. We both agreed that it just kind of lacked any presence or pop. The margherita was decent. However, we both found it strange that their mozzarella had a very sharp, almost cheddar-like aftertaste. I'm not sure why. My girlfriend seemed more put off than I was. Very interesting. The Fico is probably the best of their offerings, as they use a very high quality fig paste. It's good, but sadly, we've seen it done better at other places.\n\nCrust is a bit baffling to me. During the first visit, I felt the crust was very comparable to Bianco in terms of texture and taste. Coming back almost a year later, it tasted far more doughy and not quite what we've become accustomed to. I guess that's what happens when you make changes to the kitchen.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the nutella indulgence. We both love nutella, so this was a default choice. It's okay, although as another reviewer noted, would probably benefit from a scoop of ice cream. I wouldn't quite put it on par with some of my favorite Nutella desserts in the city, as I feel there's way too much going on with all of the combinations they throw in here.  \n\nOverall, I think this place works for what it is. A respectable pizzeria and beer joint that seems to receive a lot of business. While I wouldn't quite rank it up there with some of the best in the city, it's by no means a poor choice. If you've never had this type of pizza before, I'm sure you'll be blown away. But if you're well versed in wood-fired pizzerias in the city, you'll quickly realize that this place kind of just blends in with the rest of them.\n\nRecommended to try out.
