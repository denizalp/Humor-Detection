First I need to say that the foods and services were EXCELLENT. It is definitely a place where you go when your company is paying because the Entrees were all in $30+ range. However, I ordered Ahi Tuna Skewers from Small Plate section and it was delicious and enough for me especially when combined with my Crab Cakes appetizer. \n\nThe ambiance of the resturant is very masculine with dark wood paneling and Men's club type decorations. Not a place for a romantic dinner unless you're planning on talking about your Pre-Nup arrangement. If you're dining out with your business associates over 40 years old, this is the place to go.\n\nTwo of my colleagues ordered Steaks and said that they were cooked perfectly.
