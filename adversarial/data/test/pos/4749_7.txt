If you are considering this program, I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO FIND ANOTHER! They should be ashamed at how they treat their students. They should be ashamed to even call themselves a school. \n\nThe worst part about my experience here was the student services. If you've ever been a student, you know that student services & the people that can help you w\/ your studies are very important, especially w\/ online courses. You will get little to no help w\/ them! Especially when you come across a problem, they play the blame game on their own coworkers & say there's nothing they can do. Don't even think about asking to speak to a person in charge\/supervisor because I did & that person refused to even come on the phone...why? Because they know their wrong & have nothing to say!\n\nYou guys can keep my money since you're so desperate for it... you guys are pathetic. I canceled my program. \n\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
