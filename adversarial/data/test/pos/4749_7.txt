Love the 32 oz frozen margaritas! This is the first bar that I went to when I woke up the next morning in Vegas! I loved the outside bar with stools and the mixed frozen margaritas. I had the orange mixed with blue. So bomb! And the service is quick and friendly. My bf payed 15 for a 32  oz and that includede the souvenir plastic cup! I went back for refills like twice. Loved it. I'll be back!
