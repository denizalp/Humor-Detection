I spotted this donut shop by accident, I was looking for a different donut shop called the pink box and passed by this location, found the pink box but display was not very appealing so I went back to donut mania to see what they had and was surprised to find that today was the grand opening, the display was appealing and pastry looked delicious so I purchased a glazed and a twist and was offered a free choice as a grand opening perk so I chose a cinnamon swirl which was outstanding, all of which were superb. I must also mention the staff who were nothing short of good friendly people. Run don't walk to donut mania, worth a place by your morning coffee!
