I actually stumbled upon American Video and Security by mere accident.\n Not even a month after moving here, I had an attempted break-in.\nIt took me about a week to finally leave my condo. I was so scared.\nA friend suggested I look into a security system and after calling several companies, I gave up due to contract issues and other reasons.\nOne night, I was on Craigslist and decided to type in \"Security Systems\".\nI came across Bob Bowers Ad... he was contacted the next day.\nOn the phone, Bob had a very understanding disposition.\n After a day or so, met with Bob in person and proceeded with the paper work for my new and very affordable American & Video Security System.\nThe following Monday morning at 9, AVS Technician, Todd shows up with all his equipment in hand, he brought his own mini power vac! \nBob even stopped by my condo to make sure all was going good, how awesome is that?!\nIt took Todd a good 4.5 hours to install my new 2GIG Alarm System. He then proceeded to fully explain how to use it! \nNow, first... let me tell you... I am not very savy on New Technology but, Wow! I actually understood it. The Beautiful Alarm Panel is so sweeeeeeet!\nI even contacted the 2GIG company to thank them as well!\nAfter Todd left, I can't begin to tell you how I felt!  I purposely opened and closed doors and windows just to hear the warning Chime sound. \nThere is nothing like the feeling of actually, feeling safe. Especially in a place where I only know a few people.\nThat night, I had the most restful nights sleep I've had in a long time.\nI thought about it and realized it took a near tragedy to find American Video and Security . I hate to say it but, it was worth it.\nI now own my system, when I move... Todd will come and uninstall the system and reinstall it in my new place.\nYou couldn't ask for anything better than that...\n\n~Thank you Bob Bowers for your Craigslist ad.\n~Thank you Todd, for installing my new 2GIG system.\n~Thank you American Video and Security System for being here!\n\n\nAngel Wright
