Compared to their other locations, the Scottsdale location is small and carries nothing.  But when you look at how horrible people dress in our fine state, then you know why this Barneys doesn't carry Rick Owens, or Junya Watanabe like their other locations.  \n\nYes, the selection is lacking, but the menswear selection is the best in the whole state.  It is wonderful edited with simple, classic, modern essentials.  The most eccentric designer they carry on the men's floor is Etro, and that is conservative compared to what the L.A. or NYC locations carry.  If you're looking for jeans, they have a wonderful selection ranging from A.P.C., Nudie, to your basic AG's and Levi's (the made in U.S.A. line).  Their shoe selection is small but edited.  They carry Harry's of London, Crockett & Jones, to Lanvin sneakers.  The suiting area is a bit of a disappoint.  The used to carry Kiton and Isai, but at least they still have Etro, Armani Collezioni, and their private brand (made by Canali).  Niemen's suiting selection is better, but Barney's is still able to compete.  Their dress shirts and tie selection is the best I have seen.  I know of no one else carrying Duchamp or Richard James ties.  I was ecstatic when I saw this location carried Guy Rover dress shirts.  They also have Isai shirts and ties (as of 3 months ago at least).  \n\nIn conclusion, though Barney's may be small, the selection is wonderfully edited.  The service is top notch and the staff is very helpful and will answer your questions.
