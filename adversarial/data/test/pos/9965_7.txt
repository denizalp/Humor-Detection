Over the years since my original review, the theatre had started to see better days with wear and tear.  Recently, the theatre began a remake by installing recliners in all theatres.  Have of the work has been done and they're working on changing the other side.\n\nThe screens are new and larger and it appears that they have added new curtains in the theatres to help with the sound.  The seats recline--not as much as some other theatres and there is a bit less room between your feet and where people walk.\n\nThere is an extra bonus to these seats.  If you feel a bit warm on your lower back, you've pressed a button below the up and down of the seat.  This is a lumbar heating switch.  I couldn't imagine why my seat felt like my car's heated seats in the winter.  Then I saw the light.  Nice touch.\n\nIn addition, they have put carpeting in with LARGE letters so no one should have a problem finding their row.  Well, yes, someone did yesterday.  I wonder why some people turn stupid when they walk into a theatre or stadium and can't find where to go.\n\nNice upgrade, Cinemark!
