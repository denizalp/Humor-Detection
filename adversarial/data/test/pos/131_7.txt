This is a Spring 2012 RW review (even though spring doesn't start for a few more weeks).\n\nWhen we were deciding on a restaurant to check out, one of the criteria was a place that neither of us had tried before. Well, I failed on that. Hence the review update. But that previous visit was just to the lounge to watch The Skooners play. I had never dined at Brand before.\n\nLet it be known that I'm pretty cheap. RW doesn't normally interest me. So with that in mind, I have to give up the five stars to Brand. Everything was excellent (to my admittedly unrefined palate).\n\n1st course: Onion Soup - 24 Hour Caramelized Onion, Four Cheese Gratin\nI don't know that I've had a lot of onion soup in my life, but this was a tasty start to the meal, especially since I was recovering from a little cold.\n\n2nd course: Chilean Sea Bass - Lemon Risotto, Rock Shrimp, Lobster Broth\nThe fish was perfectly flaky. The risotto had great flavor, but wasn't quite perfect. Granted, I just had the best risotto in my life the previous week up in Napa Valley. Still, it was an excellent main course.\n\n3rd course: Grilled Banana Smores - Coconut Peanut Butter Sauce, Vanilla Ice Cream\nO. M. G. Each course of this meal just kept one-upping the previous. Talk about a creative and delicious dessert. As Angela H described, it's cracktastic! Think of a grilled whole banana filled with chocolate and topped with marshmallows, and served with graham crackers, peanut butter, more chocolate, and some ice cream. It's truly redonkulous.\n\nApparently, Brand has a happy hour from 5-7pm. I think our next plan of attack is to check out the HH and just order some more of that grilled banana goodness!
