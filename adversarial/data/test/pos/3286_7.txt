Time for an Herb Box update... this one is specifically for the catering side of the business.  Read on if you want details on the pre-pre-Wedding celebration we had at our house last Thursday night.\n\nI always knew that when the time was right, I'd have the Herb Box cater a party for me... and the time finally came.  We had about 40 people over at our house on the Thursday night before our wedding.  It was primarily our friends that flew in from out of town early and we really wanted to entertain.  So I reached out to Robert, Director of Catering, and explained what we were thinking about.  \n\nHe responded in no time at all and he was extremely professional as we went back and forth a few times on pricing, menu, etc... the outcome was perfect.  We had a buffet style dinner including a chef and two buffet attendants.  Robert and Mary came over to the house a few days before to do a walk-through, and go over details.  \n\nOn the day of our event, the team came early and went above and beyond, even running to the store for us to pick up lemons and limes.  I know you're dying to know what our menu was, aren't you?  Okay - I'll share!  Here you go:\n-Urban Market Salad with watercress, red pepper, dried corn, sugared pecans, avocado, and blue cheese vinaigrette (dressing on the side)\n-Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress, pear-gorgonzola salsa\n-Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze\n-Asparagus couscous with feta and mint\n-Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs\n-and of course my favorite, the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curry\n\nWe arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event.  They worked within our budget and made it quite an evening to remember.  I highly recommend using The Herb Box whether you're catering a party for 12 or 100+.  Just trust me on one thing - make sure you get those sweet potato chips!
