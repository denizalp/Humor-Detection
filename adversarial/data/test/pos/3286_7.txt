I don't understand why there are so many 5 star reviews, the meat is good but you barely get any, you get a tone of rice and it's not lentil rice with onions and stuff it's, like barely seasoned white rice, then you get a very little amount to sauce on each corner of the plate and then abunch of cheap lettuce, worst shawarma Iv had in a while, owner seems like nice person, jo daily specials, honestly over price for rice and raw vegetables with a little rice
