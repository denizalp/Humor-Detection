The grand tour of Las Vegas spas continues!\n\nAfter kicking off my Vegas weekend with an afternoon at the Aria Spa, I decided to finish off the weekend with the grandaddy of spas -- the Qua Spa at Caesars.\n\nThis time I came prepared with a reservation for Qua's men's \"poker face\" facial.  The name doesn't really mean anything in particular -- it's just the generic men's facial.  But generic is good, since the aestheticians take the time to analyze your complexion and skin condition to customize a treatment for you.\n\nI'd give the facial a B.  It was definitely relaxing-- relaxing to the point of me dozing in and out of sleep several times.  I loved the papaya and pumpkin-scented enzyme masks.  And who doesn't like cucumbers on their eyes?  Unfortunately, the centerpiece of the facial was just deep-cleaning with a Clarisonic, which is fine, but something that can easily be done at home with a gadget that anyone can buy at CVS.  The \"mini-massage\" component of the facial was very gentle -- gentle to the point of not being able to feel anything.\n\nThat said, my skin had a nice glow once the facial was done.  The best facial that I've ever experienced was the one at Sahra Spa at the Cosmo, and Qua's version didn't quite compare -- but let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good, amirite?\n\nOf course, Qua's common facilities are lovely as well.  There's a dry sauna, steam room, cold mist room, and a handy-dandy wet sauna for shaving or...umm...other \"water sports\" of your choosing.  There's also a ginormous hot tub, which was the perfect place to relax post-facial.  (I might've screwed myself over by getting chlorine all over my freshly exfoliated skin, though...)  The layout is a bit confusing and maze-like, but, luckily, signage is abundant.\n\nWhile nice, Qua's common facilities don't have the \"wow\" factor of other Vegas spas, either.  In fact, they're pretty spare and nowhere as extravagant as depicted in photographs on the website.   Plus, Qua is really freakin' expensive.  Thank the maker that the $75 admission fee was waived when I booked the facial, since there's no way in hell I'd pay that much for just a day pass.\n\nAll in all, Qua is a nice option, but I think I'll stick to the Sahra Spa next time I need some skin rejuvenation in Vegas......
