The WORST place I've ever stayed at. I love how this place is called \"The Jockey Club Resort\", because it is the total OPPOSITE. The \"penthouse suite\" was a complete DUMP, so don't be fooled by their pictures on the website. They obviously do not maintain it, and I've stayed in better motels than this place!! We did not book this place, so we did not stay here by choice had we known it would be like this......\n\nPenthouse unit we stayed in: https:\/\/m.airbnb.com\/listings\/2723250\n\nPROS:\n-price\n-access to cosmopolitan pool (THANK GOD)\n-full mini kitchen area\n\n\nCONS:\n-IMPOSSIBLE to get a cab in the lobby here. You have to walk over to Cosmopolitan hotel in order to get a cab.\n-stains on bed sheets of master suite room\n-cushioned toilet seats (in master bedrm)\n-filthy shag carpet that hides the most bacteria and dirt\n-bedding on each bed looked like it was donated from the Salvation Army. Flat, no fluff, never washed, & from the 60s.\n-outdated decor\n-bed sheets look like they've never been washed\n-gross stains on carpet\n-shower is gross and the hot\/cold almost burned us bc it wasn't working\n-mirrored walls\n-GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!!!!!!\n\nStay here ONLY if you do not mind stains on your bed sheets or care about cleanliness.\n\nPicture below is of our actual room. My friends CALLED to tell me to bring my own bedding because they had to use POOL TOWELS to line their bed due to stains. DISGUSTING. So I brought my own flat sheet to sleep on top of this old bed. Thank god I didn't bring back any bed bugs.
