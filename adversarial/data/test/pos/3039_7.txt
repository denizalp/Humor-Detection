Again, another hit for guu. (Hit out of the park?)\n\nI am in love with the room to the right, where you go shoeless and sit on straw mats, while the tables are close to the floor. I know, I know, it's basically like a normal table and chair, but the chair is built into the room...but hey, don't knock. It's still cool.\n\nAs with the other location, great food. My friend and I got the ribs and the mackerel to share (need to brush up on my nonexistent Japanese skills...so don't know the official cultured names of these dishes) and they were scrumptious as always. The mackerel in particular was tender, juicy, and seared to perfection.\n\nI had the sake mojito this time around. I love mojitos. I love ramune. (Both tables beside us turned to watch as we caused a commotion releasing the marble.) I loved the sake mojito. Pretty easy to understand, I think.\n\nNo munchie goodies with the bill, but I will gladly trade those for the awesome mats on the floor.\n\n(Oh, probably obvious, but it's LOUD. bring a megaphone.)
