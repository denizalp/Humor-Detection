Whenever I come to a special place like this, I feel lucky we have it right in our fair city!  I may not be a botanist, but I do know that there's some purdy flowers and plants growing at Phipps!  \n\nI visited for the first time during the Dale Chihuly exhibit a couple years back.  It was SO gorgeous.  I just love his work!  But going at night, it just shined!  Literally, they knew the right spot and the right lighting to place these amazing pieces of art that made them pop among the plants.  I'm sure it was intentional to put this exhibit in the winter, so that you can have multiple bursts of color in the usually dull winter months.\n\nGoing back, I'm glad to see that some of those Chihuly pieces are still tucked into permanent display.  This winter's theme was The Nutcracker.  They had Christmas trees decorated as the specific dances\/lands in the story.  It was a really cute idea.  The real beauty was the massive tree in the Victoria room.  I love blue and silver, and this tree was decorated in that color theme.  It was incredible!  I also enjoy the orchid room.  It's really cool seeing the different types of orchids they have.  I also always think I'm in the garden scene in Alice in Wonderland, when the flowers are singing.  You too?  Okay, maybe not, but it's a nice little scene for me to think about!\n\nI've actually only been here in the winter months, but it actually makes me think I need to visit sometime in the spring\/summer\/fall.  I walked through the outdoor area with mostly dead shrubbery and flowers.  But you could tell with the landscaping that it has to be beautiful in the right season.  They also have a lot of different events going on throughout the year, like dinners in the botanical garden at night (which sounds really romantic and cool) and special rotating exhibits.  So go out and enjoy this unique place, just don't think you can pick up some free flowers, they probably frown on that!
