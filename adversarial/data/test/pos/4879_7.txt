Highly disappointed!!!\n\n I made a reservation for Valentine's Day 2015 on Oct. 24, 2014. I've literally been planning my entire Valentine's Day weekend around this restaurant reservation - I'm staying in Paris, I'm seeing a show after this meal... you get the idea.\n\n Unfortunately my plans were shattered today when I received a call from Stacy  around 1:30PM asking me to confirm my reservation and note that they had a \"special\" Valentine's Day menu. Okay, no big deal, this isn't my first time dining out on Valentine's. I call back Stacey at the number she provided (not the main number) and it rings and rings. I call back 15 minutes later. Same thing. I try calling the main line which takes me to the Paris operator and ask to be transferred to GRS only to be told they are not currently open. Clearly somebody was working when I received the call, but now they have magically all disappeared in a matter of an hour or two!\n\n I call back this number several times over the course of the next few hours with nothing more than a ring-ring-ring-ring... ever heard of a voicemail or a pre-recorded message letting callers know when you'll be open... or if you're open? Hello, is this thing on? \n\nI finally get a hold of someone around 6PM tonight and confirm my reservation. I ask her about the \"special\" menu as I know I am  a very picky eater and the hostess tells me I can find it on the OpenTable website. So I get off the phone and hunt down this menu which is not easy to find and there's almost nothing on the menu I'm going to even think about eating!! Honestly, my husband who will eat almost ANYTHING hardly even saw anything on there that HE would eat!! I called back to verify that nothing else would be served that night, and that's what I was told. I was planning on ordering appetizers, filet mignon, dessert, tons of champagne, etc. but now I can't get ANYTHING that I'm even remotely interested in! I don't want a freakin' quail egg! I want to order off your REGULAR menu that I based my reservation off of TWO MONTHS AGO!!!!!!!\n\n I do not understand the concept of a \"special\" menu on Valentine's Day! I assume this is to make it easier on the kitchen and wait staff (along with making it more expensive by taking off the cheaper menu items) but instead it ends up making it a pain for the consumer.  I am so very frustrated and disappointed. I wanted nothing more than to have a fancy French dinner at an upscale restaurant on Valentine's Day at Gordon Ramsay Steak, and instead I had to cancel the reservation I made over two months ago and now I'm left scrambling to find another place to meet our needs on Valentine's! How romantic indeed!\n\n Screw you, Gordon Ramsay, I'll go waste my money on overpriced food elsewhere!
