Third time I've been here. \n\nFantastic food. \n\nMy problem was the service. My problem was when our waiter asked how everything was going and if we needed anything. In mid sentence the waiter noticed the college girl next to us was raising her hand for his attention (yes, like grade school hand raising) and he completely dismissed us and catered to her. He brought out her request and then got back to us. \n\nPoint being, we felt very disrespected.
