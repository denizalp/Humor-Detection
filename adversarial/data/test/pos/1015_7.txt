Decided to try the place out after reading about it.  Food was terrible.  $16 for a burger, only worth about $8, if that.  Fried pickles were like none I ever had before and tasted terrible.  The only good thing was the beer was cold.  Would not go back to order food again.\n\nUpdate to comment below:  we did not complain about food while there because it was our first visit and it appeared that the food was properly prepared but the bison burger was a single patty that was extremely thin and was not near the quality that the price would dictate.  All menu items were very high priced.  The comment on the other place was made months prior to ever visiting your location so it had nothing to do with being a coincidence.  However since you brought it up, we have since tried the new location and they will kick your butt.
