Update:\nGiving one more star as someone (they didn't identify their position) from Ocotillo responded to my review right way. They addressed the menu changes (I certainly understand that restaurants do this) and photos, and that I did have prosciutto, they cut it to resemble bacon. What they didn't address was the long wait for our meal and that it wasn't hot. Also that grilled bread is a personal like\/dislike and sorry that I didn't enjoy it. Well I've had grilled bread before and I do like it, but not cold!\nThey invited me to come back to get a better impression of the restaurant. Thank you for your offer, but my husband and I will pass.
