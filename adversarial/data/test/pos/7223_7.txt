My #1 favorite bar in Vegas.  All drinks are $8, so don't f*ck around ordering anything less than 4 or 5 skulls (they rate their drinks 2-5 skulls, depending on strength).  I've had just about everything on the menu, and they're all good.  Atmo: totally Quentin Tarantino -- dim, smoky, tiki, jukebox stocked with 60s surf music.  Clean bathrooms, friendly staff.  No food, but there is a Del Taco right across the street!  Gets pretty crowded on Fri\/Sat nights, but if you hang out long enough it's almost like the tides rolling in and out -- crowds come and go, all night long.  You;ll be sitting there alone with no-one but the bartender, and next thing you know at 3am a fresh wave of meth heads, Cirque stagehands or rockabillies will come in.  Weird!  Love it!
