What words can describe this place? Its like a Funko Pop Bobble Head in restaurant form. It's located in a small plaza next to a Sonic. When we went, the plaza was not crowded and the restaurant had a few people inside eating or waiting for take out.\n\nThe menu changes often, per the server, to accommodate for changes in likes and ingredients but there are the popular dishes that have always been on the menu since the beginning:\n1. Crispy Brussels Sprouts: Tangy with that touch of sweetness. The fried leaves are flavorful with the drizzle\/soak of sauce that taste like it has some honey, vinegar, and spice. 8\/10\n2. Sweet Corn: A version of creamed corn with pork belly and what looked\/tasted like queso fresco. The flavor of the cream was a bit strange but I couldn't pinpoint why it tasted that way. That said, the corn was sweet, and even that it was a bit odd, the creamy, rich corn was a good side. 6\/10\n3. Crispy Rainbow Trout: My favorite dish. The trout was perfectly cooked. The meat just sturdy but easy to break off and not crumbly. The julienned peas were fresh. The sauce tasted like sweet fish sauce with slivered almonds. I like things salty so I felt it was a great but it can be salty for some. It was all over a bed of rice. 9\/10\n4. Triple Garlic Yakisoba: Comes in a Asian To-Go box but then you flip it out onto the plate and mix. Truly garlicky but IMO, if you are showcasing the garlic, I wouldn't cook it until it becomes sweet and I really wanted that kick of garlic flavor. It wasn't bad and a good carb but just OK. 7\/10\n\nNonetheless, it was a great place for the meal. The server was very helpful and friendly. The vibe is relaxed with R&B playing. The walls are painted with the restaurant name on one side and other pictures on the other. Worth a try and since the menu changes, it is worth coming to see what else is new.
