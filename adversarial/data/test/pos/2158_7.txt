Why do craft stores always smell like cinnamon? \n\nMaybe there's some scientific study the Michaels people commissioned where they found that the \"Scent of Christmas\" causes otherwise sane people to spend obscene amounts of money on those rubber stamps and scrapbooking scissors. I don't know but it freaks me out.\n\nIt also makes me sorta hungry. But what it doesn't do is make me want to buy anything. \n\nAnd the woman in a cat hair-covered black velour tracksuit blocking the yarn aisle ain't helping things either.
