We came here on a Tuesday morning and order 2 casino specials for $5\n\n- The restaurant in Rainbow is called Images \n- Breakfast specials served from 6-11am. As long as you are on the waiting list before 11, you can still order from the special menu! \n- 15min wait around smokers can be a bit irritating, but can't blame them. \n- Casino special is the same as El Dorado's Cafe and Grand Cafe's midnight special, 2 eggs, choice of 2 sausage or bacon, hash brown, and choice of biscuit with gravy or buttered toast. \n- Hash browns are very crispy here! \n- Service is very quick! We got our food in about 5-10min. Great job Lacie. \n- If you want to order another Casino special for yourself, it's 2.89! Haha..\n- Prices are actually more expensive here than El Dorado, gotta love the 4 deuces there. At Images, it's 4.25!
