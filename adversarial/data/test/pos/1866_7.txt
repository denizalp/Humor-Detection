I love this service. It would be 5 stars, but I had 1 car that was smelly as hell. Well actually it was the driver that was smelly. \n\nTip - make sure you also use an Nav app like Waze and give the driver directions if you think he is taking you a crazy long way. This is so much better than cabs in Vegas. Great for when you want to go out for drinks and be a little responsible for a change. Just add $30 to your budget and Get It In!!!!!
