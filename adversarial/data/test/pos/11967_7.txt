This place is a dream come true for me!  I'm a fairly organized person and love having everything in a spot so its easy to find in my place.  Since I just moved, I was looking for a cute tabletop desk organizer to keep stuff like bills and important paperwork around and organized.  Since my other favorite store called storeables closed, I found this place instead. I  had no idea they were even in the valley! Shame on me!\n\nAnyways, this place carries everything you could imagine.  Laundry stuff, bathroom, drawer organizers for the bedroom, office and just about everything closet organization you could think of.  I wandered through the store and really loved the selection. I've ordered from their website before but never been in the store.  They have great sturdy containers that I use for scrapbooking supplies, which I still have today all these years later.\n\nTheir selection 's amazing.  Lots of different styles, sizes and options to choose from. I was in the office section and noticed that they had a stackable office organizer, but it was to big for my needs, as I wanted something more compact to hold mail, clips, and a few other things to keep out on my table for when I do bills or have important documents that need my attention.  They had an entire aisle just for me!!  I found a cute little mesh wire organizer and I immediately knew it was mine! Plus, it was only $10!  Nice!!\n\nWeather your crazy organized like me, or you just need help getting there, this place has something for everyone.  Don't be afraid to channel your inner diva at this place...guys included.  Staff here is awesome, friendly and helpful and will answer all your questions.  The guy at the register who checked me out was so friendly, and it really made my day.
