I have been here a few times and always find something new to try. The staff are a delight and I have great back and forth banter with the elder gentleman who is usually at the counter. \n\nMy latest visit here was to get supplies for a friends Hot Pot night. Both of the staff were incredibly helpful with my questions. They directed me towards the best cuts of meat (I knew thin cut beef and pork worked well but not the specific type - i.e. fatty or lean). There was a great selection and variety of fresh vegetables which were well priced. Self control with respect to the assortment of red bean paste-based sweets was difficult but I managed!
