Hula's is a pretty cool spot.  Its a tad small but clean & cozy.  The name was a bit misleading, as I did not see one tiki, coconut bra or hula dancer anywhere.  Positives would include  weekend happy hours, a dog friendly patio and good location.  Weekend evenings can get pretty crowded, but its pretty open during lunch, and a good option for post work happy hour. \n\nTip -try the pineapple mimosa
