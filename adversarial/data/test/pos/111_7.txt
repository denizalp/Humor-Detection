Fare thee well Jerry.  After 24 years and my last dining experience at the coffee shop my family and I bid you a fond farewell.  What is going on in this restaurant??  Waited over an hour to be seated in a half empty restaurant.  Problem?  The cooks were backed up  Really?  Staffing issues were the next guess.  Ok.  Ordered appetizer, a reuben sandwich, and a dinner special (fish)  and chicken fingers.  Appetizer never came.  Dinner arrived 40 minutes after ordering.  Sandwich inedible.  Mystery meat dark purple and crunchy ??  Fish,  completely tasteless on 2 slices of tomato instead of the bed of spinach as stated. When I told the manager the fish was frozen (that was THE only flavor) he argued with me and said it was \"ice packed\" not frozen.  I sit corrected.  The manager tried to make things right but we had no appetite and were not interested in waiting another 40 minutes.  After noticing a subtle decline the past few years. this is the end for me.  Very sad.  I have very fond memories of this place.  MANAGEMENT..... fresh food please, stop with the frozen crap.and SEASON the food as described.
