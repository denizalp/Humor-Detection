This new establishment opened about 1 week ago. This is located on St. rose parkway near St. Rose hospital sienna campus right next to the Tommy's burger place you can't miss it. \n\nFor someone who is really hungry order the caniac! it comes with 6 pieces of chicken fingers, coleslaw , fries , a piece of bread with two special caniac sauce and a drink all for $8.59. Bam! What a deal! Oh yeah they will charge you 29 cents for honey mustard sauce be aware. Grrrr! I'm a stinking Asian every penny counts for us joke!!:)\n\nFast food establishments aren't my usual cup of tea. But I made an exception with this place. Customer service was great you were pleasantly greeted, the drive through had a long line but they managed to get everyone out if there within 10 minutes. I really enjoyed my food. The thing I like about their chicken fingers is they use lean white meat and the breading was great! Can't go wrong if your on the run and looking for a quick bite.
