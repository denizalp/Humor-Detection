what can one person say about food heaven on earth.....the ox tail soup is the best in the west....i am in a different world when i walk thru the doors of el rancho. i drive or fly from san diego just for the ox tail soup...........the service and the fresh food is better than some 5 star restaurants i've eaten at. again 5 stars is not enough for this place. when i die i want my ashes spread around the place.
