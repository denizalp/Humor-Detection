OMG OMNOMNOMNOM!\n\nThis maybe the biggest secret I've ever unleashed on Yelp!  The Kraft\/Peek Freans Cookie outlet!  Buy billions and kajillions of cookies for $5!!!  Ok maybe not billions, but at least millions!!!\n\nGiant garbage sized bags of minor barely broken pieces of chips ahoy, or lady fingers or wheat thins and other assorted cookies.\n\nEven though I've passed by it a million times, I only stepped in for the first time when I was getting some work done at the mechanics across the street.\n\nAnd OMG! OMG! OMG! Coooookiiieeeeeeeessssss!\n\n(Think cookie monster) OMNOMNOMNOMNOM!
