Choosing between Southwest Airlines and Greyhound Bus?  Don't!  Choose Allegiant instead.  Look at the fares and factor in the \"nickel and dime\" charges for luggage and so forth, parking costs at the airport,  and I'd wager you will save money by choosing Allegiant.\n\nWe flew on newish Airbus planes with young and energetic pilots.  Our flights were on time.  Luggage was quick.  Staff was pleasant.  And I wasn't surrounded by a bunch of career people who were all dressed up for their flights like I see at Sky Harbor.\n\nGive them a try!
