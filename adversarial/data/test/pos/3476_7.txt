I was a customer of this office and I have to say that Duvel is very nice and seems very knowledgeable, but his staff are absolute, poorly trained idiots and THEY are why I canceled my auto policy.  \n\nSadly, each and every time I've had to deal with his staff I've been left thoroughly irritated.  The problems with the office staff have ranged from unprofessional demeanor on the phone, to no returned calls after I've left voicemails, to giving me the flat-out wrong information about my policy, to not even answering the phones during the posted business hours!  \n\nAnd the last straw for me was when Duvel himself mispronounced my first name.  I had logged into my State Farm account online to check my auto insurance rates (against a quote I had from another place) and out of the blue that afternoon my cell phone rang and it was Duvel calling me to see if I needed anything because they'd noticed that I had logged into my online State Farm account that morning.  (If you can get past the creepy factor that State Farm makes notes of when you log into your online account, I think that following up on that is a pretty good customer service move on their part.)  \n\nAnyway, I bet Duvel, rightfully, suspected that I may be comparison shopping and wanted to save my business, but the problem was that he called me Sharon when I answered my phone.  :\/  (Uh, my name is Shannon and it's a pretty easy name to pronounce.)\n\nI'm gonna chalk this up to one of the idiots working in his office getting some automated report that a customer had logged into their account and was accessing copies of their policy, and this same idiot probably wrote a quick note to Duvel and put it on his desk:  \n\nIt probably looked something like this:\n\nDuvel-\nCustomer named Sharon accessed her account this morning, you better call her and see why.  Maybe she's gonna cancel?\nSincerely,\nIdiot Employee\n\nWell, if they had managed to get my name right *maybe* I would have kept my policy there, but botching my name in addition to all the other customer service blunders I'd experienced when I had occasion to deal with his office staff was just too much for me.  \n\nIt's too bad too, because he seems like a nice guy who really knows his insurance business.  Too bad his staff doesn't seem half as capable.
