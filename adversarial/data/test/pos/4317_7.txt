I booked online and over the phone.  Jesse U had showed up a few minutes early and was available by phone via a temporary text message and phone link that forwards to his phone.  He was polite and verified he was in route.   \nHe showed up and after a quick review he put in headphones and began working for the entire 2 1\/2 hours.  During that time he completed all the rooms we requested.  When he was completed he had me review his work and politely closed the appointment, shook my hand and thanked me for my business.  He was prompt, very attentive and since we wanted a general cleaning so he can cover more ground in the house as opposed to focusing on a few rooms being deep cleaned we are completely satisfied.  He is very professional and him cleaning the house allowed me to focus on a few other tasks outside and errands so it was time and money well spent.  In talking to him he had a professional background in prior employment which explains how he carried and conducted himself. We and friends have used Homejoy in the past and were very happy with the results.  They use a telephone staff in the main office that if an issue arises they have authority to make it right instantly which is something large corporations can learn from.
