This is an interesting place where Church's and White castle are together. It's a pretty quiet place - not many people visited there, not sure why. I wanted to have spicy but apparently they didn't have any ready so they would want us to wait for 20 minutes, so I decided to get normal instead cuz I didn't want to wait for that long. The fried chicken was ok; I can't really tell if it's because they didn't fry it long enough or their seasoning needed improvement. I did enjoy the fried okra though!
