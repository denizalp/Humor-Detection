Great local shop and a great selection... from $7 bottles of wine to $500 bottles of cognac. They also stock Crystal Skull Vodka (promoted by Dan Aykroyd in one of their other locations in Scottsdale recently).\n\nOne of the owners, Ted, was there this Sunday and was extremely helpful. We know nothing about wine, and he took the extra time to make us comfortable and explain which types might work best for our palates. His knowledge is extensive.\n\nWe purchased a bottle and are excited to give it a try tonight.\n\nI also picked up a couple \"pocket shots\"... this is really cool technology and I have not seen it anywhere else in the valley yet.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.pocketshot.net\/
