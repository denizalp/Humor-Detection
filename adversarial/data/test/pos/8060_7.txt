The d√©cor here is elegant: dinnerware in white resting neatly on the tablecloth in silver, mural of Chinese paintings, huge flower arrangements, floor lamps with big shades and high ceiling.  The chefs here have used a modern way to present the dim sums:  there aren't bamboo steamers, and steamed dim sums are placed on plates instead.  I like the \"chicken duck egg in sticky rice wrap\" the most.  The sticky rice wraps are opened up and presented like a sandwich on the lotus leave with duck egg yolk on top.  The bottom is seared and crispy.  But there are a few chicken strips on the side drenched in sweetened brown sauce; they are dry and tough.  The \"special BBQ pork bun\" is a must try; the baked pineapple buns are soft and fluffy and the BBQ pork is delicious.   \"Eel rice noodle roll\" is delish..  I can't imagine a thick slice of eel wrapping around in rice noodle roll could be this good!  But again there are some edible garnish, and again they are drenched in sweetened brown sauce.  The steamed meatballs don't have garnish drenched in sweetened brown sauce, but instead, they are each sat on a slice of bitter squash and circled by a few corns.  The bitter squash had lost the greenish color, and it had been overcooked.  Shrimp dumpling is embellished with shrimps and sweetened orange sauce.  Beef tendon with fries..... the list is endless........... each and every dish has garnish that is edible.  Some of them are drenched in sweetened-colored-sauce, some just don't \"fit in\", and most of them - don't taste good!  If you don't want to ruin your meal here, just let the garnish does its job; comes as garnish and leaves as garnish.   Ambience -5 stars, Food-3 stars, Service - 2 stars
