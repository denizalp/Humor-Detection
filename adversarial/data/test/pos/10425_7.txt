It's adorable. I stopped in on a sunny summer day and they had the door open to the bakery, making my visit feel like I had stumbled upon a nice neighborhood caf√©. It seemed the type of place that would have a collection of regulars, since everything was so authentic and made with love. \n\nThe pastry cases loomed out at me with numerous tarts and scones, but it was the croissants I was craving. I settled on a chocolate almond croissant and loved its flaky exterior and gooey almond insides. The thin layer of melted chocolate on the bottom portion of the pastry was perfection. The dark richness of the chocolate nicely complimented the sweetness supplied by the almond and both were enveloped by the croissant's soft interior. \n\nCan't wait to be back to try some of their famed breads, sandwiches, and definitely the tarts. There was a caramel nut one that I almost caved into buying but I wanted to savor that croissant, and that I did. Until next time.
