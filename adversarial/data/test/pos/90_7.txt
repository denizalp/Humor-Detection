Hello.  I want to save anyone I can from attending this university.  It is a joke. A friend of mine who is an intelligent, hard working mother and career woman attending this university.  She paid in full her tuition to receive a degree in psychology.  When she was researching different colleges she chose NCU because they guaranteed that she could go at her own pace.  She was receiving straight A's and liked all her teachers in the first year, but as her career was becoming more challenging and her children were taking up the rest of her time she would spend the late hours into the night working on her school assignments.  She was finishing three to four papers a week so that she could get them passed in by the deadline that the school gave for that class.  She was confused when the Teacher would not except bulk assignments.  Yet when she passed them in one at a time the teacher was aloud to take up to seven days to grade!  I witnessed her panic and frustration with the teachers and faculty.  The faculty never took the paying students arguments.  Which I find that very humorous since the students are paying their salaries! The first time she found out they didn't take bulk assignments was when she went on vacation and wanted to turn in all her assignments so she would not have to stress about it while vacationing. At the time she didn't have a lap top to take everywhere with her.  She had to go out of town on business trips and sometimes if a few papers were due between those periods she needed to turn them in before she left.  It was truly a ridiculous rule!  They told her she could go as fast as she wanted or as slow.  In reality they lied!   She did everything in her power to plead her case.  I read the email she wrote to the Deans office, and she had valid points.  The Dean took the teachers side every time over the paying customer.  This university does not care about the students, they care about greed.  I've noticed more and more in the past few years that this country is becoming overly greedy.  I come from France where education is free.   I'm appalled at a University that takes over $17,000 from a student so she can complete a few classes in order to receive her degree and then dumps her in the last year when she was almost finished and doesn't give her a refund on the classes that she needed to finish to go somewhere else to complete them.  Shame on NCU.  I would have giving this school zero stars if I was able.  They don't deserve even one star!!!
