For our date night last night, hubby and I started at Dominic's.  \n\nIt's the first time in two years we've ordered their food dine-in.  I'm pleased to see that, even after a major fire threatened the business, it is alive and well.  Nicole was our hostess and Michelle was our server.  They were both so nice and helpful!  \n\nOur Hawaiian pizza was perfect (that buttery crust - oh man!) and the onion rings were okay.  It was the chipotle ranch dipping sauce that made our side order sing. The only downer to our meal were the complimentary breadsticks.  I am grateful they offer them right after you're seated, but sad that they taste like steamed dough.  It would be nice if they basted them with garlic butter and crisped them up in the oven. Maybe serve them with oil and balsamic vinegar or marinara?\n\nBright and cheerful, Dominic's is a pleasant place to spend Saturday night.
