We made reservations through American Express.  When we got to the front desk and check in was almost complete, they handed over  a \"spa voucher\" which was in the past had been a dining voucher.  Confused I said this used to be a dining voucher in the past and I had no need for the spa voucher asking if there was anyway I could convert it to a dining credit.  They were inflexible.  I asked to speak with a manager thinking surely they would want to make a frequent customer happy.  The manager very unapologetically and matter-of-factly informed us it was for spa use ONLY and it could not be converted to dining.  He acknowledged that this had been the case in the past but is no longer this way.   So sad I really loved this resort until today.  I decided to cancel my reservations because of this snafu and relocated down the strip to Bellagio where they happily let us decide to opt for a dining voucher over a spa voucher.
