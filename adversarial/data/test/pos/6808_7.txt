So I'm scrolling through Instagram being all nosey and ish on a Sunday morning and came across a Yelp post about this spot. Hopped on over to the official Yelp place for this joint and saw all these 5-star reviews. Now normally I would just bookmark a new joint or a place I want to try and get to it when I get to it, but I was at my house literally salivating over the pics I saw from my fellow Yelpers. That ain't the norm for me. So I just knew I had to stop at this place on my way to work. Well... it's not exactly on my route to work, but it's close enough. \n\nI figured this place would be jumpin on a Monday morning, being that's it's new, it's the morning, this place closes at 2 PM. NOPE! But that's great for MEEEE! I didn't have time to stand in line. Didn't matter anyway, cause they move pretty fast. \n\nI slide up in this spot, was greeted with a smile, and was squinting at the menu above when the lady at the register gave me a menu to view. I was overwhelmed cause everything looked good (pics from Yelp I mean), and I didn't know what I wanted to try first. Decided to go with what I know. And what I know is cheeese. If they can't do pimento right (cause they advertised it), then I'm pressing on. I know this place is about biscuits, but all the elements have to come together. \n\nFinal verdict: They did it right! They did it ALL the way right! \n\nTo be honest I'm not a biscuit person, so I have nothing memorable to compare this to, but this biscuit was RIGHT! It was flaky, buttery with a hint of sweetness. I LOVED IT!\n\nI loved the creaminess of the pimento cheese and the few jalapeno peppers for a bit of kick. \n\nThe chicken was crispy and cooked just right. I have to say that because of a popular place (that shall not be named) that I frequented often was giving me some undercooked chicken on several occasions. And that's a no-no. \n\nFor the price, it's a pretty huge biscuit. So it's extremely filling. \n\nThe potato salad was aight. Better than some but not the best. I wanted to try something different and this was different. The flavor was good, but I'm particular with what's in my potato salad. I ate it all so it wasn't bad at all, just not the best. Again, good, just not the best.  \n\nBut BRAVO Holler and Dash! I'll be back to try another biscuit tho!
