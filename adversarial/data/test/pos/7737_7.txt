I came to the Golden Nugget to see a show and decided to have dinner at Lillie's.  I was seated promptly in a mostly empty restaurant.  I was brought my iced tea quickly and then I ordered.\n\nFor starters, I had their marinated jelly fish with sesame oil, chilis, and some thinly sliced pickled vegetables.  The sauce made with the oil and chilis gave the jelly fish a very good taste.  This was the first time I had jelly fish and I found it good.  Chewy and not too flavorful in itself.  It needs a good dressing, like pasta, to give it some flavor.\n\nFor the main course, I got the curry chicken clay pot.  The dish was listed as spicy and it was.  When brought to the table, my server cautioned me not to touch the bowl as it was very hot.  When he removed the lid of the pot, the dish was bubbling from the high temperature.  I let it cool for a minute or so.  The thing that caught my eye on the menu was the chicken was in a coconut curry sauce and it had pineapple as well as mushrooms and some normal vegetables in Chinese food.  The pieces of pineapple went well with the heat of the curry.  The portion was large enough it could be split by two.  I wasn't going home after dinner or I would have taken some home in a take out container.\n\nMy server suggested three items from the menu and I ended up with the lemon yuzu cake.  It was quite good and a nice finish to the meal.\n\nService was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled often and for each course the server and the manager came by to check and make sure everything was OK.
