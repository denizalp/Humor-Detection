GOBBLE GOBBLE\n\nIf you're ever yearning for some thanksgiving food before thanksgiving definitely try this spot out and get the \"bobbie\"\n\nTurkey, Stuffing, and Cranberry Sauce in a sandwich. It was very flavorful and was definitely a good hang over food lol oh plus if for someone you feel a little lazy call them up they deliver. \n\nThe 20'' inch subs are good for 4 people but even after that you still want another..thats how good their sandwiches are. I will definitely come back when I get back to Vegas. Peace Yelp Heads!
