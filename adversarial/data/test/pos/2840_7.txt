My most recent experience at Prince's Island Park while sitting on a rock trying to write, and being interrupted by a gentleman with a mohawk, a shark tooth around his neck, and Ed Hardy rip off shoes.\nStranger: There are a lot of birds. \nSarah Louise: Why, yes there are.\nStranger: Do you like birds?\nSarah Louise: Yes. I'm sorry, but I'm trying to write.\n(long pause)\nStranger: (thoughtfully) What's your favourite kind of bird?\nSarah Louise: (with obvious irritation) An owl, I guess.\nStranger: WANT TO KNOW MINE?\nSarah Louise: Not in particular.\nStranger: THE RAPTOR.\n(pause)...\nStranger: Want to know why?\n(pause continues)....\nStranger: BECAUSE IT IS THE MASTER OF THE SKY.\n(still no response)\nStranger: WHATS YOUR FAVOURITE LAND ANIMAL?!\nUnfortunately, this mostly one ended conversation went on for nearly twenty minutes as I waited for my friend who I was to meet in that particular area of the park, until said stranger tried to touch my hair and I issued an actual slap. From now on, I will be bringing a bodyguard to Prince's Island Park. \nThat aside though, I love how this park comes alive most of the summer time with all the festivals and what not. Calgary Folk Festival is my personal favourite, where I can be found for the entire weekend drinking sangrias, swooning over all of my favourite bands, and hopping on the rocks next to the beautiful river. The park is always gorgeous, with the exception of when the City of Calgary decides that construction is awesome. Stupid peace bridge. A great place to bring visitors to the city if there's something going on, although I prefer less busy parks for when I want to actually just chill uninterrupted.\n\n(11\/30)
