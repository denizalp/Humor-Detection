One of the worst movie theatres in the area.  The sound kept going out, they stopped the movie, rewind, and start over.  And again and again the sound goes out.  Tried to talk to the manager and ask for a refund, was told since they rewind the movie and we didn't miss any parts they weren't going to refund the tickets.  Tried to explain that it totally ruins the movie going experience, again nothing.  Like the Tempe Marketplace Harkins much better.
