Balls. Yes . I am writing a review that starts off all about Balls. Yes. Balls. Mancuso's is located in the downtown part of Phoenix near Chase Field and The Talking Stick Arena. You may have to look a little to find it within the enclave of other building fronts of the Collier Building , but you will and when you do, it will be worth it.  Now, despite this review starting off about Balls, the MEATBALL, type of balls,  mind you! Mancuso's is a very classy , intimate Italian place. Down home authentic Italian. But let's get back to the Balls. In the BallRoom the most amazing meatballs are made: succulent , amazing and so yummy that you can't just have one. They are on Mancuso's Happy Hour from 4-7pm and I highly recommend you sample as many as you can prior to moving into the dining room later for dinner .. but maybe you just want to fill up on these amazing Ball Room Balls. Of course you may be stuffed if you do! For $5 you get two BIG balls made of Veal,Beef & Pork, Turkey or add a few bucks and get a special Bacon Wrapped Shrimp Ball(s). Then, add a choice of sauce : Marinara ; Arrabbiata; Alfredo or Pesto. They are served with a generous serving of Parmesan \/ Garlic Toast.  Amazing for dipping up that sauce! IF you didn't want to leave this big ambient Ball Room , add a side of pasta or salad or veggies and quinoa for $4 ! The drink specials are also amazing : $7.50 Martinis \/ 1\/2 priced Margs\/ Wines by the Glass $3 off \/ Bottles of Beer $2 off and $5 Wells.. there is a great selection of mixology drinks and a great wine and beer list. The bartender , Pai, has been with the Mancuso family for a LONG time and even relocated from Bobby's in Scottsdale to this new location downtown. I loved that he could tell you the history of the family and how this location came to be. In fact, the Mancuso family has a pretty long and colorful history in the valley of over 35 plus years and the menus recipes are from Fran's ( one of the owners) mother Agnes' Mancuso and her family from Northern Italy! After we filled up on balls.. we moved into the dining room. Here we started with the Crab Lump Meat Stack a generous portion of fresh crab atop a stack of hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, greens, tomatoes and asparagus with a light dressing. I'm picky about crab being in Arizona and this was super fresh and great for sharing. My dinner entree was the Baked Meat Lasagna and although a tad heavy on the salt , it was a huge portion and like my Gram used to make! RIch, full of cheeses and meat! I couldn't finish it all.. errr maybe I was full of balls! Fran Mancuso oversees the dining , literally she walked around the night I dined here and checked on us; that gives a very homey touch! I was so impressed with Mancuso's and I'm so happy they are in the downtown arena, as I think a place such as this was needed. Great, authentic Italian is so hard to find and this is a special place!
