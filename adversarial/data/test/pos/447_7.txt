I went to the grand opening. We went in a really large group, paid for all drinks in cash and I only charged one $30 transaction. However, when I looked at my credit card statements there were two more charges on my card adding up to $150. Our group tipped them very well, and all in cash. Horrible experience and also got charged 2 times for drinks transactions that I didn't even get to enjoy. I would never recommend this place to a friend and would never set foot in here again. Very unethical services!
