You better have a range rover, Cayenne or other luxury SUV when rolling in to this Costco.\n\nIn addition to the usual Costco fare this location carries a selection of high end items. Notable items are very high end watches like a $27999 Cartier watch, the elusive kirkland scotch, high end reserve bottles of wine, bags of frozen Ahi Tuna and Empire Kosher chicken breasts.  \n\nParking can be tough to come by on the weekends here, I often go with my older parents who get VIP handicapped parking.\n\nThe biggest negative about this location is the food court hot dogs, they are not Hebrew national. They are Kirkland brand.\n\nNot this costco also has a automated car wash for $7.99 bit pricey but seems to do a good job.
