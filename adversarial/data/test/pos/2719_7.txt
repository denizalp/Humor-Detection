A sailor such as myself is forever dealing with the seductive advances of sirens and succubbi. That's just a fact of my life. But, friends, let me tell you a tale of a particularly harrowing ordeal.\n\nWhen I say \"a sailor\" I mean \"a middle class white guy\" and when I say \"sirens and succubbi\" I mean \"coffee places.\" I feel that disclaimer is important.\n\nSo I was sailing along with me vessel and me crew, and the lads (just me) were starvin'. As ye tend to be after many a fortnight at sea (an afternoon of laying in bed). Just then, we began to hear a gentle song floatin' o'er the breeze. Now, a seasoned captain such as meself (I'm 26 and sort of went to college) recognized these lilting notes as that of a succubus immediately. But the lads (nope), they was taken. Positively taken. I had to risk a mutiny or follow the call, friends, and I had no choice a'tall.\n\nWe (I) sailed into the port o' Starbucks and I was immediately taken by the number of other sailors. Surely this must be one of the busier ports for this mighty succubus. The succubus chose a simple decor and 'er minions are always quite friendly even amidst the chaos of so many enchanted sailors (middle class white people). Seating be limited, though, so batten down ye hatches if ye lookin' to settle for a spell. The minions, forever enslaved to her call, peddle reasonable quality goods and do so with speed.\n\nI request a bean drink over ice and the minion, with it's Cheshire Cat smile, produces. The lads (again, I am friendless) be lovin' this oasis but only I know I am being taken. None of this is as it appears, friends, and the mighty succubus surely awaits in the murky shadows a-ready to plunge us all to our doom. But that mix o' reasonable quality an' reasonable speed, me hearties, it's a falsehood this sailor (boring white guyyyyyy) could get mighty comfortable in. Mighty comfortable, indeed.
