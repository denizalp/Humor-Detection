Omg. This is not the first time this has happened, but last time was my son. My mom checked in to ER today at 1:00. It's now 7:00 and has yet to see a doctor. Are you kidding. 6 hours and nothing. Ok. I exaggerated 12 minutes. It's 12 till 7. \n\nWhen we were here with my son we waited in the main lobby 3 hours and just left.
