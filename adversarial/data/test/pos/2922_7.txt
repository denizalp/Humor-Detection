I should have known that anything with \"authentic\" in the name of the restaurant is a tip off that it's not authentic. But I trusted other Yelpers that must have been compromised with the \"punch card\" they like to do here. 6 meals gets you a freebie. No thanks. \n\nThe sample house wine they offer tastes like communion wine. I get it's their house wine but man let me just bring in my Thunderbird or Night Train wine. Fail \n\nBread gets 5 stars. \n\nAntipasto salad mixed at the table gets 5 stars. \n\nHere's where things go into an uncontrolled nosedive. \n\n4 cheese sauce is blah and flavorless. There's no fixing this mess in the kitchen. \n\nKids pizza was terrible. Woolworth's pizza back in day was better than this offering. \n\nI had spaghetti and a meatball with sausage. Sausage was dry and was sliced up and maybe that's why it was drier than the Sahara. The sauce was ok and I sicilianized it. That means garlic, pepper and spicy. \n\nThe other end of the table was lasagna and manicotti. Seems if you stick to the red sauce you are in safe harbors. Once you leave those harbors the waters get choppy! \n\nThere was a low carb chicken shrimp dish that was deemed \"gross\" and poorly executed by most at the table. The shrimp was poached as was the chicken and lacked any resemblance of flavor and was devoid of any taste. It was barely eaten. The waitress should have picked up on this terrible mess in the kitchen and offered to replace it with something else or take it off the bill. She did neither and failed miserably in her chosen profession. The server also took a salad away that was still being eaten. Didn't even bother to ask.\n\nWhich brings me to the last part of this awful meal. The waitress had zero personality and  zero charisma. A Waymo van might as well been our server. She didn't engage her customers at all. It was like she was a drone devoid of a soul that failed to connect at all with anyone at all at our table. Maybe she needs to be head of security for ex Sheriff Joe Arpaio! Lol he's got the personality of a toilet seat so it would be a perfect fit! \n\nSo 20% if the meal was ok and 80% was awful. Never going back. No second chances. One and done and on a mission to expose this place with the truth! \n\nI didn't even want to try their dessert at  the end of the meal. \n\nMy new name for this place is: Phony Tony Bologna! \n\nFlying Black Wolf keeping it real for the masses!
