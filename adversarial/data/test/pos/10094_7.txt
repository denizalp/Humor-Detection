Considering you can't give 0 stars, TCSSC gets 1 extra star for sport selection, both that's really all they have going for them.\n\nFirst, the prices are ridiculous. Compare to any other leagues in the city and other cities around the world and you'll realize you're being gouged.\n\nI would be fine with the price if the product was of high quality. Instead you get terrible customer service and no referees. I realize the sports are co-ed and recreational, but no referees leads to a multitude of problems, especially when the games become more intense (i.e. playoffs).\n\nI played one season of indoor soccer in this league and it was a horrible experience. First of all, there are no nets, instead you use flipped elementary school benches like you're a 5-year-old. We had a disputed goal in the semi-final game (what a surprise!) and the TCSSC head office staff was extremely unhelpful when we tried to resolve the issue. We vowed never to play in TCSSC again.\n\nPlease support another GTA sports league: XTSC. Their prices are cheaper, indoor\/outdoor soccer includes real nets, all games are officiated by an XTSC referee, and the staff are extremely professional and accommodating. The problem is that they only have soccer, dodgeball, and volleyball at the moment. Please support them so that they can start to add more sports!
