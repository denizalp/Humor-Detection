Update: after a night, all the cuts from the harsh cuticle pushing, filing and buffing showed up. Out of 10 fingers, I have cuts on 5.  My fingers are not happy from what should've been a relaxing experience. Updating from 3 stars to 2. I think the owners are trying hard to make the business work but this nail tech is not on the same page. I probably will not go back.\n\n\nCame here after work and the place was pretty empty. The lady who did my eye brows was pretty pleasant and the price was decent. It was normally $10 but they were doing 10% off so I thought it was worth it. \n\nSince the lady who did my eyebrows was so nice I decided to give their nail service a try too.  I thought I was going to get the same person but ended up with this other person at the store. Impressed? No. \n\nOverall-she did an okay job but would I ask for her again? Probably not. Here's why:\n\n1.  She was really rough when she was pushing back my cuticles. I get it... I haven't gotten my nails done in a couple of weeks but there is no need to use brut force. She was scrapping my nail bed so hard that I flinched a couple of times\n\n2.  She gave me a pretty bad cut when was buffing my nails.  It hurt so bad I pulled my hand back and she didn't even notice the cut until I started bleeding. Then she tried to stop the bleeding by wiping alcohol on it and that stinger so much. \n\n3.  The filer were used. I get it, not every place will give customers new filers but this one was USED to the bones. Time to get a new one.\n\nI think overall, the owners are trying really hard to give excellent service.  They are super friendly and very accommodating.  She went helped me with picking colors. They look like a local business that is just starting so I am all for that. I would probably give them another try but would not ask for the same nail technician.
