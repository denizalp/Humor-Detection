Patio action in February is always A-OK in my book. The 75 degree temperature this past week was the catalyst for my recent visit. I needed a drink on a patio and Nacho Daddy has Union Jack on tap and\/or a free house Margarita with a Yelp check-in. I skipped on the margarita (saved the offer for later though) and opted to share a pitcher of beer with my party. Union Jack pints were $7 and pitchers were $25. \n\nIt was mostly about the atmosphere and alcohol so the only food I tried was the order of spicy shrimp nachos. It was good for what it was, bar food to soak up some of the alcohol. The service was great, our drinks were never empty. Not awesome but good enough to sit and sip on the patio. The beer selection does take it up a notch if you want something other than the usual tecate or modelo offered at most Mexican spots in Vegas.
