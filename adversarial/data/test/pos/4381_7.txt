I don't enjoy writing negative reviews. In a lot of cases bad service is redeemable, what isn't is a rude, arrogant owner that doesn't value their customers enough to handle their complaints with maturity.\n\nMy husband and I have patronized this restaurant several times, usually the pizza is decent.That wasn't the case tonight. Instead what we received was pie that would bring any seasoned pizza-lover to tears. The entire center was a soupy, congealed mess that was completely inedible. We chalked it up to a one-time mistake and figured we could just call them up and make it right.\n\nCalled Pino's and asked the polite, young cashier if I could speak to a manager, to which she hesitantly replied, \"Um, well, my boss isn't here, but I can take a message.\" I declined, and instead explained the situation to her and asked for a refund. She then informs me that her boss IS there, in fact, he's the one that made it. She asks me to hold while she tells him. She comes back on the phone and nervously says, \"He says that the pizza is perfect and that if you want to bring the pizza back for a refund that's fine, because if he makes you another one it's going to be the same.\" \n\nI felt so bad for this girl, she sounded so uncomfortable. Truthfully I found it pretty pathetic that he had her say it for him. And considering my husband only made it about half a slice in before declaring that it tasted as bad as it looked, I told her he'd be glad to bring it back for the refund. \n\nWhen he got there, she nicely handled the transaction, and then Pino made his way to the front, opened it, barely looked at it, and then condescendingly said \"That's the way it's made, if you don't like that style, no problem\", and turned his back to my husband and just walked away. Cool, man. You seem like a really reasonable person. \n\nMaybe Pino and Sammy from Amy's Baking Company are long lost relatives? Needless to say we wont give this place our business again.
