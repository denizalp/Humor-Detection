This is my first time visiting this place and the place was good ... I liked the burger it tasted good and crispy fries, would not say the best burger but definitely good I felt like I has similar burger before but I am not sure where specially the place is not franchises ... I liked the service the guy was very nice ... The setup of the place was good but the location was hidden, it is located beside tire services and other places that got nothing to do with food  ...
