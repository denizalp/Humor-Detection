You better be good and hungry when you walk through the doors of Sunny's diner. Because your portions are large and flavorful. The service was good and their waiters and waitresses were fast and kind. They kept our water, coffee and juice filled. We had stopped in for lunch. But I must say I was unable to dinner afterwards. \n\nI will be returning. They had a few things on the menu that I want to try. That plus an easy-going atmosphere works for me.
