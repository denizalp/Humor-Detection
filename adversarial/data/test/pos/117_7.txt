They have a nice fresh selection of goods every day and prices can be higher than the norm for some things, and yet not for others. What I have an issue with, is I find them very cold and dismissive. I've noticed most of the polish customers and staff seem to treat you different?? if you're not polish??? Just an observation.... I don't feel comfortable shopping there anymore which is no great loss. I feel like the staff are robots and if I didn't know beter I'd say they behave like Scientologists.
