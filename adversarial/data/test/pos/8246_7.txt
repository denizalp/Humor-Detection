Very Rude and unprofessional owner! I left a msg explaining the poor job that was done on my carpet and he spoke to me in a very condescending manner, as if I was not  being truthful. I told him to send a tech out here to sniff the carpet and smell the odor that was left behind an he was like yeah ok. This is the first time I have heard of that kind smell being on the carpet. Overcharged for a incompetent job! My carpet was not cleaned fully! The previous owners of our new home had dogs and were train smokers. Our carpet still smells like dog urine in some spots, even though we were charged $75 for a special solution to remove the pet urine and bacteria on our carpet. Our downstairs area smells like cheese on the carpet! I have no idea what the cleaners did wrong there. Total waste of money! I choose this company based on the reviews, but I have sadly paid for my misjudgment. My advice would be to watch the carpet cleaners clean your area in your home, make sure all spots are cleaned and all smells are removed before they leave.
