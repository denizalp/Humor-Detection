Have you seen Coyote Ugly? Well its just like that... Crazy drunken bartenders dancing on the bar, pouring shots in to patrons mouths, bikers galore. Love this place. When I go downtown I always end up at this dive. Very reasonable drinks and a one of a kind staff I always suggest this place. If you offend easily this is not the place for you. They also have a photo booth which is always a crowd pleaser.
