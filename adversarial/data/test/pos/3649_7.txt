I've been dying to try this place thanks to all of the stellar reviews. After eating here, there is no way is this place a nearly 5 star German restaurant. Please note that the bulk of stellar reviews come from people who say they have never had German food prior to this meal.\n\nBrian P. & I came here for our weekly date night on 1\/3\/15. It was a big surprise for me because Brian knew how much I wanted to try it despite living on the opposite side of town now. We figured the reviews, plus the much hyped once a month buffet would surely be worth the long drive and steep price. We were disappointed.\n\nThe best way to describe the food is like this - if you were going over to your German friend's house for dinner but their mom toned the food down to try to appeal to what she thinks is your American tastes. She also decided to use a bunch of premade stuff because she didn't want to waste the good stuff on her kid's school friend.\n\nThe buffet included: \n*Marinated cucumbers - a bit on the bland side. Not too tangy or seasoned. \n*German potato salad - decent but not as tangy or hot (spicy) as I prefer.\n*Mashed potatoes - fancy looking but tasted like premade potatoes from the grocery store.\n* Spätzle - Good. Possibly coated in margarine rather than butter.\n*Sauerkraut - decent.\n*Rotkhol - decent.\n*Roasted chicken - very good but just regular roasted chicken.\n*Peas & Carrots - straight up frozen, from a bag, peas and carrot cubes. Did not try.\n*Assorted sausages - what types they were was unlisted. Did not enjoy.\n*Pork Schnitzel - very thin and crispy, but the highlight of the meal.\n*Frikadellen - reminds me of the hamburgers my parents made when I was young that I hated. Did not enjoy.\n*Brown gravy - OK\n*Mushroom gravy - OK, tasted like thickened, canned soup.\n*Paprika gravy - looks gross because of vegetable bits but tastes delicious.\n*Assorted packaged mini desserts from the store such as cupcakes and those little doughnuts that come in powdered, waxy chocolate or toasted coconut.\n\nFor $22.99 per person, I expect more than prepackaged desserts, frozen vegetable medley and the cheapest items that I have or can make (sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, ground beef patties.) I made spätzel daily as my after school meal in middle school. Parents make better cabbage dishes and cucumber salad at home. For that price and as much hype, I shouldn't say \"if I had to choose, I'd just eat a plate of the sides.\"\n\nWhile the staff was friendly and the kitchen looked exceptionally clean from the register, for that price, go enjoy AYCE sushi or meat heavy Korean BBQ and save German food for your make-at-home meal.
