Reathy Sekong is the only Cambodian Restaurant in town so it is the BEST CAMBODIAN Restaurant in town and also the worst Cambodian Restaurant in town. This is a small restaurant where you enter from the parking lot behind the restaurant. You see grape vines, fig trees and a big Italian looking dry fountain. Inside are all kinds of interesting Cambodian relics.\n\nI had a wonderful meal here last time and was hoping to have another wonderful meal here again. \n\nWe started with a spring roll. The spring roll was large enough for two people and seemed freshly made and was tasty with the dipping sauce.\n\nI specifically came across town to try the National Dish of Cambodia. The Fish Amok. After I ordered it the waiter told me the kitchen wasn't making it today. So I ordered something else real fast and just hoped it would be delicious.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Kreung. It was basically a stir fry with similar seasonings that the Fish Amok was made of.\n\nWhen I saw the dish I was VERY surprised to find a very large portion of chicken. I'm guessing it might have been eight ounces with fresh green beans and fresh red bell pepper slices. The last time I was here I think they only gave me 5 small chunks of meat that might have added up to only TWO ounces but it was a VERY DELICIOUS two ounces. Last time my husband enjoyed the Cambodian Sausage but it is no longer on the menu.\n\nIf you read my reviews you KNOW a peeve of mine is properly prepared chicken. I received CHEWY, RUBBERY Dark Meat Chicken in a Gritty, Paste-like, Oily Sauce that was saltier than I can handle. The sauce was heavily laced with lemongrass and also had lots of turmeric in it. Maybe the sauce is the way it is suppose to be and I just didn't like it?  However I can't justify anyone anywhere preparing of all things dark meat chicken that's DRY and RUBBERY. I don't know how it was prepared but seemed very leftover to me because it is very difficult to make dark meat chicken dry and rubbery. \n\nMy husband tried the Mi Keaw Noodle Soup. It came out almost COLD with two shrimp in it and SOGGY home made pork dumplings that busted open in the soup. (THAT IS A FAIL) My husband had to fish for the dry dumpling centers. The soup was not flavorful and just was an almost cold gooey mess. He also received a side of bean sprouts with wedges of lime in antique bowl that had chipping red paint that didn't seem sanitary to me.\n\nThe waiter was too busy to check on us and never asked how things were.\n\nI don't know what happened in the kitchen. I don't think the same caring person was preparing the food as last time. \n\nMaybe it just was an off day?\n\nLast time was a BIG HIT this time was a big miss.
