I give Caesar's 4 stars because every time I come here I am always amazed at how beautiful the property is. The casino, exterior property, and Garden of the Gods pool area are IMHO, the most impressively designed of all the Vegas hotels. I mean the Cosmopolitan is awesome too, but I just love the Ancient Rome motif at Caesars. The Bacchanal Buffet is my favorite buffet in Vegas. I personally have always had great service from the staff and that is one reason why I keep coming back.  \n\nThis last trip,  I stayed in a room in the Roman Tower. It was a small room but very clean. I was nervous at first because you could clearly see that the center of the mattress was noticeably sunken in.  Ultimately the mattress was still comfortable and I'm pretty picky when it comes to a mattress. The room clearly had a bathroom redesign at some point. It had a large roman tub and a huge shower as well as double sink. There was one annoyance though... The bathroom had no door separating it from the rest of the room. Now I don't know about you, but I like a lil privacy when I'm dumping. This is especially true in Vegas where copious amounts of alcohol and buffet food can add up to some pretty tragic dumps. LOL. I keep no secrets from my wife, who was staying with me, but I don't want her to keep the door open when she's dumping and I'm quite sure she feels the same way about me. For the love of God.... Caesars, when you remodel a bathroom, don't forget to put the freakin door back on.\n\nOther than that, my stay at Caesars was enjoyable yet again and I will be back.
