East Towne was where my mall rat days were played out from about 12 to 14 years of age.  It has changed so much over time. I remember the sunken seating areas where kids would sit and hang out, I remember the movie theater, Yonkers, the cookie shop where I had my first love affair with chocolate cream cheese brownies, and the security guards who hung out with us like they were part of the group... Yea... I remember my bike being stolen and a week later being found stashed behind the bushes at East Towne Mall...  \n\nIt has been about 6 years since I have been back inside that mall, and I was expecting a run down, empty shell of a mall like some haunts I know in Milwaukee..  \n\nI'd heard stories of people getting attacked in the parking lot... that the place has really degraded... \n\nPssshhh, WHATEVER Madison!!  This mall is decent.  They have a new Express store opened, the food court and carpeting has been redone, nice decorating and a comfy feel as one walks through the hallways, a Hollister, Boston Store, a nice Victoria's Secret....  \n\nSeriously, I was pleasantly impressed that the mall of my mall rat days is still doing just fine.  \n\nIs it Mayfair Mall in Milwaukee?  Heck no!  But it sure as hell is A-OK.  East Towne is a staple for east siders like myself, and we're not givin' it up!
