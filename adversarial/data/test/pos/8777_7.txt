Yo KoMex...Dawg...Where have you been all these years i've been living in Vegas?!?!\n\nI'm not from LA i'm from NorCal so the whole Korean\/Mexican fusion never hit me until i started thinking about it and realizing that...holy shit it just might work...\n\nWould have LOVED to try out more of their fusioned foods but man 4 lettuce wrapped (low-carb) tacos filled me up.\n\nWent here for a 2nd round taco eating contest UYE. Winner narfed down an amazing 12.5 tacos. TWELVE AND A HALF!!! i was stuffed after 4 and those were low-carb'ed.\n\nAll the meat choices were pretty awesome, if i were to pick a favorite...i would just get them all. Are they a bit on the small side? Sure, they are street style after all but man oh man KoMex doesnt hold back when they stack the toppings on. \n\nAlso love the way they dice up the kimchi so you can get some in every bite. Great stuff.\n\nNow if only there was a fusion of Horchata...
