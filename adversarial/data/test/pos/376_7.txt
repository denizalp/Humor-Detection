I have had their food, it is OK, not the greatest for the price you pay.\n\nThe ice cream is great! It's very creamy...I love the turtle, but the only thing I don't like about it is that they change the flavors every day and you never know what the flavor will be, that is annoying to me!\n\nWhen I like something, I stick to the same thing every time. This means that I will ONLY go there once a month for the ice cream that \"I\" like!! The other problem with that is that I always forget when that will be, so that leaves me only going there about 2-3 times per YEAR!!! Which sucks because I DO LOVE that flavor!!
