Gates & Brovi is home to the best cheese curds in Madison. There, I said it. FIGHTIN' WORDS. Come at me, bro.\n\nEveryone has their favorite place...but I would literally crawl to G & B for their battered curds. They're crispy and not soggy...how a real cheese curd should be. I have enjoyed everything I've ordered. \n\nThis place is amazing----I love the vibe, the food selection, and the craft cocktails.  \n\nParking in this area is the only draw back. They have suggestions on their website, so I would plan ahead. It's an awesome option for those on bike----would be awesome if G & B invested in some established bike parking (I have yet to find a bike rack nearby...?)\n\nWhether you're local or visiting....don't miss this place.
