So, update to my review. Just had more issues with our vehicle. I'm not saying it's an old car, but I do believe there are scratches on it from a T-Rex. Bill has managed to keep it (safely) on the road, and without forcing me to get a 2nd job belching the alphabet or something. OK, here's the details on the most recent problem. Gas was leaking when my wife filled the tank so I figured it was the filler throat\/hose. Since I had no wish to see if our car could double as a space shuttle, we had Bill check it out. He verified we had a gas leak (from the car, not from me after chili night), and also discovered some other issues. For everything he did, the price was still very reasonable, and our car is safe to drive again. Unfortunately he can't do anything about the loose nut behind the wheel (when my wife drives), but this car should last at least another couple years. The maintenance is definitely cheaper than a car payment.
