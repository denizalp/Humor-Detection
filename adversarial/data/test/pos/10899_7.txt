I've been here three times and had a great experience each time. It's warm and cozy inside, and the servers are so nice. They always make me feel good about my choices too.\n\nThe menu is half Indian and half Tibetan. I always order at least some things from the Tibetan side because it's in Little Tibet afterall. Plus I've enjoyed all the Tibet dishes I've had here :)\n\nTonight we had a combination of items from each side of the menu:\n\nLamb Rogan Josh - delicious, nice tender chunks of lamb in a creamy sauce\nRice - average, ordered this to go with the lamb\nPaneer Naan - YUM! get this get this get this. Served hot and fresh with cheese inside.\nBeef Momos - like beef dumplings, except more firm and with a thicker shell. Comfort food.\nTheinthuk - hand-pulled pasta in a beef broth - I really liked this. It's hearty and the pasta definitely tastes homemade. The pasta is similar to the shell of the momo. The beef is kind of meh but to me the pasta and broth are the stars of the show.\n\nIt was definitely too much food for two people. We could have skipped the naan or the momos and still been satisfied, but how can you skip naan and momos???
