(Unsweetened boba drinks)\nI love it here like everybody else. It's delicious!!\nI love that they can make my boba slush no sugar added (unsweetened). I am watching my sugar intake when I can so I'm happy. Not many boba places can make their slushies unsweetened. \nI never drink sweet stuff so it's delicious to me the way they made, but when my friend tasted it she said it was disgusting. If you are not unsweetened drinker, I guess it's not for you.\nI'll be coming here every week :-)
