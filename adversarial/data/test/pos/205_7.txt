Right off the bat I had problems had to wait almost 20min to be seated was seated BY The Waiter then accused of seating myself. after getting that settled I ordered the slider trio and found a hair in my fries ugh. after having to argue with the waiter again that it was indeed not my hair I finally got a new plate only to find there pulled pork tough and disgusting overall crappy service crappy food do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.
