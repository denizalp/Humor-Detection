I had a manipedi first thing in the morning.  Long line to check in.  No staff at all on the second floor for ten minutes.  Manicure was the worst I have ever had.  Polish was old and thickened.  After the first nail, I requested to pick another color that was not so thick.  This was refused.  Throughout the manicure I was constantly criticized--for dry cuticles, for the way I was holding my hands about eight times (??), for stained nails from red polish.  She constantly flooded my cuticles and repeatedly had to apply remover with an orange stick to scrap away extra polish.  Yes. That will help those dry cuticles.  Lol.  I do better applying polish to myself.  Predictably the polish buckled and wrinkled later in the day.  Left feeling bullied.  Go anywhere else.
