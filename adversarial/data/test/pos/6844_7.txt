So before I chose Don Farr I read all the reviews on various review sites and priced several different moving companies. I know there are good and really bad reviews out there.  Our move was pretty simple - a larger, more expensive moving company (paid for by relocation from my employer) packed all of our stuff an moved it into storage while we built our new house.  Don Farr moved our belongings out of storage and into our new home.  They took care to make sure the new home was well protected while moving stuff in and around (read: new hardwood floors throughout).   The price was more than fair compared to other movers for a local move (try $1,000 to $1,500 less).  They were generally efficient and helpful.   If you have a lot of expensive antiques you might want to watch carefully.  Otherwise, there's nothing wrong with them.  One guy (out of 6) was a bit of a stooge, but remember MBAs don't generally become movers.  I would recommend this company.
