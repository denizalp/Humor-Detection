** this review is for the restaurant**\n\nThe Ellis Island restaurant is the epitome of cheap but good eats in Vegas. It's located off the strip but not unreasonably far from the Paris\/Bally's area. We already heard about the great deals they had on meals but when we saw the sign for a $6.99 sirloin steak dinner with a BEER while driving into the parking lot, it was like a dream come true!\n\nWe eagerly waited for our number to be called while playing some slot machines and that only took around 35 minutes. The crowd in there was comprised mostly of senior citizens and families but we didn't mind! Our server, Jorge, was so wonderful and nice which earned him extra tip money!\n\nOk, so I thought that maybe my meal would just come with a dinky steak and a tiny glass of beer for that price but boy was I wrong! The meal also came with a choice of salad or soup, a side of garlic green beans, and either a baked potato, mashed potatoes, or fries. The sirloin steak was a massive 10 oz too!! That's unheard of! The beer also came in a tall pint size glass and I only drank 1\/4th of it. haha Jorge was kind enough to switch my amber ale to the light lager at no cost since it was too bitter...thanks Jorge!

The green beans were tasty with a hint of garlic flavor. The baked potato was great too with some butter and sour cream to top it off!

Definitely worth the wait and drive\/cab ride out here!
