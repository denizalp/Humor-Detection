The store has many costumes to choose from. Some pricey and some fairly priced. A lot of the costumes are of poor quality...but let's be honest, you'll only wear it once or twice so what does it matter.  I've made a couple purchases and they have been a hit at parties. \n\nThe staff are nice and have been helpful with finding what we need.\n\nThe store is a bit run down and feels dirty, but the product is well organized.
