I don't get it. I paid $5.99 for a very small burger which was good, I admit, very tasty, melt in your mouth, but microscopic!\n\nI think most people who rave about this place don't want to admit they got ripped off and feel the need to justify shelling out so much for a perfectly ordinary tiny piece of meat. Either that or they are trendy hipster doofuses who somehow think egotistical cooks with attitude and cramped dining spaces are authentic and decide beforehand they are going to like it no matter if their senses and sensibility tell them otherwise.\n\nI have no such qualm. I got ripped off and I'll admit it. \n\nI can say I've tried it if it comes up in casual conversation but I will never be returning.\n\nDon't believe the hype, folks. In all seriousness, you're better off going to Lick's. You can actually get something substantial and filling there.
