Overpriced, overhyped, and completely underwhelming. \n\nThe much ballyhooed sangria is suspiciously reminiscent of the Livingston kind you can get by the 1.5 L bottle at Wal-mart for $5.97. Don't get me wrong: I am fond of said sangria, but cheap and voluminous is on its side. Caffe Boa sangria is $5 or $6 a glass, which is mostly ice, with an afterthought of an orange slice and a sorry maraschino cherry. (To be fair, the second glass we had at the dinner table had a few token blueberries and a strawberry chunk tossed in for good measure.) \n\nThe menu is kind of limited. Not an overabundance of options for your vegetarian friends. The pastas start at $13 and I saw something likely involving a steak at the $31 mark. Wooooo! I thought I was on Mill Avenue...? The crowd of extremely trashed and screaming college kids at the bar reaffirmed this, and I am really not so down with paying Scottsdale prices for a squealing co-ed experience. \n\nI had a salad with sad, droopy leaves and too few chunks of feta and spicy pecans to break up the soggy monotony. The bread that comes out before was tasty, but the accompanying sauces disappointingly bland. The only partially saving grace was the bruschetta, although I could have done without the drizzle of syrupy balsamic, which overpowered the fresh tomatoes with sweetness.\n\nWe didn't even stay for dessert, and for us, that says a lot. Total mediocrity, across the board.
