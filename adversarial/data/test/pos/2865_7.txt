$42 this memorial weekend.  I've been here before and I'm very disappointed how this time around the food is bad.  The food is super dry and salty.  Eggs are runny.  Fruit is all sour. Service is slow. Took us 20 mins to get in because they had two cashiers.. One catering the Gold members so basically one cashier.\n\nVery limited selection.  \n\nI mean, who fucks up eggs\n\nKale salad has been out.  Walked back three times\n\nWhy is there dairy in everything!!!!!!!
