Woe! Woe, wait just a minute!  Hold onto your hats cowboys\/girls, this Portillo's is the real deal!  It's worthiness is much greater than some of the 3 star reviews I'm reading on the Yelp iPad-acus.  I've been here now 3 times (Yes, I missed a checkin for you fact seeking yelp nerds) and this is the Portillo's I've grown to love when traveling to Chicago many time over the years.  \n\nThis Portillo's reminds me of the one in Dekalb IL.  The decor, shape and  size are very similar.  The food taste just as good as well!  The only thing different are the droves of people trying to go here for a bite to eat all at the same time!!  But don't let that stop you from giving this Portillo's a try!  It's a fantastic place to go for a delicious hot Italian roast beef sandwich dry, dipped or wet!  Their hotdogs are great and so are their salads (believe it or not :-) \n\n If your feeling adventurous and hungry, I must warn you this can NOT be good for your health but it is really tasty good, try their Italian roast beef and grilled sausage with peppers!  OH MY!  It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this, but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload... \n\nThe only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food. \n\nIn looking forward to going back again real soon.  I hope to see you their!
