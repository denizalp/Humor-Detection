This is a basic neighborhood bar. We came here for happy hour and ended up trying some of their food. \n\nThe drinks were not memorable, but the service was decent and the food was as well. We ordered a pizza, nachos and some wings. The waitress warned us that the chef had to hit the store for some ingredients so the wait might be longer than usual. This news made us nervous but we felt weird about canceling anything so we just sat and enjoyed our drinks the best we could. The food was ready quicker than we expected and we were pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe pizza was really good, the surprise of the evening. The wings were good too. Well cooked and meaty and I enjoyed the chipotle lime sauce quite a bit. I wouldn't order the nachos again, these were generic at best.\n\nI wouldn't make this place a regular in my rotation but they have some decent pub food, the drinks and atmosphere leave a little to be desired.
