Patagonia is known for quality products built for the outdoors.  Don't expect much as far as bargains are concerned but expect a product that does its job.  Stopped by to by some gloves.  The people here are helpful and friendly and there is a couch inside for you to sit down and warm up.  FYI this company is very environmentally sounds and among the most ethical on the planet.
