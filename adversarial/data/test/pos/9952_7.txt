2 person's dinner for $100 not worth it for a tiny place that has no ambiance, very loud and cramp. Backround live singer sounds nice \nbut hey there is more than enough noise going on in this place. \nStaff spends more time talking to customers about who knows \ninstead of getting our order quick and getting drinks and food out. \nBread sticks dripping in butter (yaks ) , chicken parm cut in tiny slices\n ( who does that ) and creme brulee cold and bland( yawn)  \nhouse cappuccino $ 7.00 yaks . besides I noticed they have no\nwebsite on their own. Great staff going around too often  \n asking you to comeback  buthey improve this place and I might.
