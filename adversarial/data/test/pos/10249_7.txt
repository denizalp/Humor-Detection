I'm actually fairly impressed.  I lived in Greensboro for several years & they have a great outdoor shopping mall that goes way back called Friendly Center.  They've updated it and it's pretty upscale now...\n\nPRSS reminds me of pre-refab Friendly Center & not in a bad way.  \n\nThis center includes food, deli, bakery, hardware, coffee, thrift, clock, music, grocery, post office, nursery, consignment, art, cleaners, shoes, clothing, movies, sports, tobacco, ice, atm's, books, toys ...whaaat!  yes, in length...everything & I'm sure I've left some stuff out.\n\nMuch more can be accomplished here in a short amount of time than in most places.\n\nParking could be a bit more \"friendly\".  They might as well make the driving lane closest to the stores a pedestrian only area (which could make it smaller) & ditch the speed bumps.\n\nIf they ever upgrade though I hope they keep the old-fashioned sign!
