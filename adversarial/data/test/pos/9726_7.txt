I went here with my partner and her mother, who was visiting from out of town. My partner and mom used the restroom, which they stated was filthy. The toilet bowl had a black ring in it and the sink was covered with hair. If the service is great, these things do not stop me from returning. The employees unfortunately were not very polite. The manager commented on my partner's tattoo, \"What is that for? Is it a religious thing? You couldn't just put it on a canvas?\" It was the definition of Namaste written on her arm. She made negative comments about hot yoga and proceeded to ridicule her employee woking besides her, \"you're so lazy, my fat friend.\" Later she said, \"I'm so tired, I want to kill myself,\" as she walked around singing Christmas songs. I was very surprised with how obnoxious they were. I asked the lady if she could cut my toe-nails short. She responded, \"I did!\" We were not impressed. I would not recommend this place to a friend. I would've been happy with all of this STILL if the chairs massaged and if I would've gotten a leg or hand massage, but I didn't. I get a mani-pedi about 3x a year. I'm not picky. That's why I give them 1 star. \n\nSorry NV Hair Studio. I hope this helps you to better your business. You have a cute place.
