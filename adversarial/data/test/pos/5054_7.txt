i was in dire need of more alcohol. the show is definitely enjoyable dont get me wrong- but the choreographed dances, and watching the boys dry hump the beds and motorcycles, the floor? is hard to bypass without a chuckle.  the guys were hot hot hot. but i had a strong sense that they werent really into women... lol. hey anything for a buck right?\n\nbut go, if its yours bachelorette\/bday party go for it! just dont end up being one of the 45+ year old women at the show going ape shit over the removal of a shirt. now THATS hard to watch!
