I am beginning to see a trend here.  First Pesto Prima Café.  Now this.  If Yelper Max A says it is a 5-star restaurant, then a 5-star restaurant it is! \n\nAnd B&G Bistro's food is exactly that.  The wonderful smells greet you at the door. Add to that a very hard working, charming young couple, Claudio and Nadine, who are at the helm, and frankly, what's not to like?\n\nSimply put...at the time of this writing, this place has barely been on the map more than 3 months.  It already has the whole neighborhood talking and supporting it.  I saw person after person come in, pick up their food, and tell the owners that they heard about them from somebody. They don't need to advertise but I shall Yelp regardless. I can already see longevity and expansion in their future.\n\nAntipasto salad. Decorated with attractive rolls of excellent tasting meats and cheese. Add more shredded cheese and very crisp romaine. Top it with still warm, freshly grilled red bell pepper in olive oil. Then top it with his house balsamic dressing. Get it!\n\nThen make sure you sop up the dressing with slices of his own freshly baked bread. And try not to roll your eyes into the back of your head while you moan in delight.\n\nChicken Marsala. Tender, generous, moist chicken breast, pounded then seared to perfection, then topped with copious amounts of sautéed mushrooms in a Marsala sauce. You get to name your pasta, Mr. B chose Angel hair.  An excellent choice.\n\nCheese Steak Deluxe. A sandwich that is destined for fame. Start with thinly sliced, tender beef and a touch of pepperoni, add well sautéed mushrooms, onions, some of those magnificent grilled red bell pepper slices, and some great melty cheese, then drop it and all its juices into one of his freshly baked Italian rolls.  Juicy, flavorful, huge. Wouldn't change a thing.\n\nThere is no pretense to his food. He cooks with simplicity. He cooks it fresh. He loves his customers and already knows them by name. There is a very special vibe here.\n\nPlenty of left overs to revisit tonight's meal. And we will be back.  Maybe to try a pizza from his stone oven.\n\nAll I can say is, if you dropped everything and ran over here now, it will not be a moment too soon, and you will be happy you did.
