I can honestly say I have stayed at (almost) every major Strip hotel\/resort in Las Vegas.  It's kind-of a badge of honor and I'm proud of my love for Vegas. I've gone there dozens of times for work, probably a hundred times for relaxation\/vacation\/gambling\/partying\/pleasure and I love the town...the size of everything...the pulse...the fun.  Love it.\n\nThe Mirage is no different...good sized property in center-north Strip location, next to T.I. (Treasure Island) and Caesars Forum Shoppes linking to Caesars Palace. \n\n- TONS of restaurants.\n- Huge casino floor with all games all the time.\n- Great poker room (an iconic place).\n- Massive sports book\n- Huge pools, and in season the BARE topless euro pool.\n- Dolphin Habitat, and the former Sigfreid and Roy Secret Garden\n- Good, clean rooms.\n\nMain tower is 25 stories tall (not counting VIP villas). You should ALWAYS request 24th or 25th floor rooms. Bigger, newer renovations, huge bathrooms, and elevators that are dedicated to get direct to those floors.\n\nMirage is a great place to stay. Pretty close to the heart of everything. Good views north and south. Good prices (unless its a special time of year).  Lots to do.  Great service. \n\nAll-in-all it is not the newest, not the largest, not the most posh place in Vegas...but it is a good spot to stay. It's bright, festive, pretty clean (except for smokers and you cant help that), and it's got good food and clubs.\n\nENJOY!!!
