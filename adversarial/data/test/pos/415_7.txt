I've been to this sushi spot a few times now to satisfy my sushi cravings... =)\n\nThis past Saturday I came here with some friends. One of the best things about them I believe is that I think they have happy hour everyday. They have a certain variety of sushi for happy hour as well as their little mini bombers. I always get my philly roll which is actually not too shabby here because they REALLY fill it with salmon and cream cheese for you where I feel like most places gip you on that. As far as their specialty rolls there weren't a lot of items that really caught my eye. We got that Rice Crispy one which is not bad. \n\nSo we saw this one drink on the menu that we just HAD to try. It's called the balls of fury. If you ever come here you HAVE to get it. It's a ginormous drink! It is equivalent to 4 regular drinks so you have to share it with someone. I'm not sure what's in it but it doesn't taste strong at all so it ends up creeping up on you! lol. \n\nAll in all, I like this place because it's really close to my house and I like their happy hour menu and drinks. I'd come for happy hour but probably not during regular hours. Or maybe come just for the drinks! =)
