We stay in Vegas about once a month. \n\nOne expects excellent service at a hotel of this caliber, but the Skylofts service is remarkable even when compared with like hotels.\n\nAnything you want? Done. Your butler will pre-stock the fridge with Coke products, but ask if you want them switched to Pepsi. If there is anything missing from what you usually prefer, it will be added immediately.\n\nIf you want a movie that is not in the DVD library, without hesitation they will run out and purchase it and deliver it to your room.\n\nI asked about ordering food from restaurants within the MGM. Within moments the butler delivered all menus from every restaurant. Anything can be ordered and will be delivered very quickly, usually within 30 minutes.\n\nWe ordered from Pearl=excellent chefs menu, Wolfgang Pucks=big fan of their tea, and normal in room dining=the banana split rocks!\n\nI had an additional room at the MGM for my kids, the staff checked in for the other room and had the keys waiting for us.\n\nI wanted tickets to Blueman. They bought them and had them delivered right away.\n\nThe bathtub is super cool invisible edge circulating fountain type thing. Nice. The shower is very nice with combo steam room\/ multi-shower head deal going on. Nice.\n\nSpa? Nice. Massage=mediocre, Facial=excellent, Mani\/pedi=normal, Hairstyling with Eric= damned awesome, never ever had better.\n\nNegatives? The only thing I had trouble with was getting the bedroom, which is in the loft part of the suite, down to a cool temperature for sleeping. I couldn't get it below 74, which is too warm for me. They did deliver fans and it helped. But despite my love of the hotel, it might prevent me from choosing it on our next visit to Vegas.
