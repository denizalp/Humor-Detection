Ok service and food. Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 2pm-6pm and the deals are good, but other places sell tastier tacos for less i.e. Los Taquitos. Waiter was very slow and forgot my drink a couple of times. Starter chips and salsa are free and tasty. Mexican corn was good as were the nachos. Carne asada and crispy fish tacos were average. Patio seating is pet friendly.
