This warehouse of a store is full of cheap apparel I wouldn't wear even if I was slumming about. One would almost do better at a Goodwill aside from the fact that BCF also has lots of other neat items such as 2 foot long sea salt grinders, chocolate high heel shoes, pop rings, and avocado oil potato chips.
