Luckily I read the reviews on yelp before I decided against purchasing from here....\nI saw an ad on Craigslist for the car I wanted. When I emailed about it, the manager Adam Goldring, called back and wouldn't give me a price on it. He said that their pricing fluctuates depending on the market or something and changes day to day. Really?? That gave mean warning flag. He pressured me into making an appointment to see the car the same day. I did, but then got online and read the reviews and it made me change my mind. A few hours later I call to cancel the appointment, and very politely say I'll reschedule when it's better for me. 5 days have passed and I've had about 6 calls from them on my voicemail trying to get me to come down there. Back off already! 1 star for being annoying.\n\nTo update: \"Tj\" is actually the owner Adam. He just personally messages me about my review I had previously posted. He wrote to me \"I've had 7 bad reviews and have sold over 5,000 cars, that's pretty good...\" um no its not. As a business owner, why would you say that? It's embarrassing to have that many. You are obviously a shady character with no integrity.  To come on here and give yourself a 5 star review pretending to be a customer is disgusting. No Adam, I will never ever buy a car from you. To this day your shady people STILL call me. Ugh....
