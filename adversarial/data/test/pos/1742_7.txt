This place is pretty much a disaster. It's a ratty little airport hotel. Perhaps you know the type. You'll no doubt be on the second floor and there is no elevator. The adjacent \"restaurant\" is a seedy redneck bar.\n\nI stayed there twice in July 2010 - going and returning from an international trip with my grandson. The second visit was worse than the first. I checked in around 12:30 am exhausted. \n\nI went to my room (second floor) and the door was ajar, the bed unmade and the TV on, although no one was there. The manager, with some hesitation, found me another room. That one had no coffee maker (although it had coffee), was a smoking room, and had a broken lock and thus no working key. I was told if I left the room, I had to go to the front desk to get the pass key.\n\nThis place is cheap, and now you know why...
