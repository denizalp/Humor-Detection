I keep giving Friday's more chances in hopes that they will restore my faith in them, but I think I'm good. Tried one of their black angus burgers and it was very dry even after ordering it medium. The bun was juicier than the patty since it was covered in grease. The blue cheese was lacking. Fry portion is now smaller, everything we needed (i.e., napkins, mustard, water) we had to ask for. I could've and should've done better at home and saved myself $40. Sorry Friday's, I must bid you adieux.....
