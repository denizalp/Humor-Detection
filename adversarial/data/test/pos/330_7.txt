My first visit here! We came in early before a show so it was not crowded. I like going to restaurants near here because in parking-challenging places like Plaza Midwood, having a no cost big parking lot is a plus..\nWe started with Nigori sake. Cold and refreshing compared to others I have tasted. \nWe got a small plate of beef wrapped asparagus and an order of shumai. The beef was tasty- the asparagus still had good crunch and the meat was tender. The shrimp shumai was not the best I've had.. a bit gummy. \nOur server ...hmm. Frankly, we were very engaged in our conversation so I didn't chat with her like I usually do so can't remark on her personality, etc. She was efficient and we had everything we needed so that's a plus. \nThe menu has lots of options, some look somewhat outside the box, so I can't wait to come back and try more items.
