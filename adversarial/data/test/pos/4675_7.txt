Can't say anything that hasn't already been said, if you're from Chicago or the Midwest in general you know all about the hot dogs and Italian beefs sandwiches the area is associated with. Portillos is the best you're going to get in the valley. Luke's greasy barely flavored sandwiches have always been a sad imitation.\n\nIf you're in the area...hell if you're not in the area give this place a try, it's loud and busy but worth it..if the inside noise is too much for you, sit outside it's a lot quieter. And the sandwiches are SUPPOSE to be sloppy...please beware of that before going, us Chicagoans don't eat dry ass sandwiches, I think those are called Philly Steaks.
