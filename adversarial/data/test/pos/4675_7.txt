Finally! Gen is in Southern NV. This is the same one in California. If u like Sura Korean BBQ on Spring Mtn, then u r going to love Gen 3x more. All u can eat high quality food for only $15 lunch and $20 dinner.  Can't beat that anywhere! Kailin our server was amazing too! \n\n5 stars for food, service, price and ambiance!
