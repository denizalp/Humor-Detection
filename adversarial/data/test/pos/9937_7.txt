I'm rarely in the mood for a burger these days, especially since they all seem the same. I mean, how creative can a burger get anymore?\n\nI didn't try any of their specialty burgers - I decided to build my own. I know that's not new or anything, but when you have things like sun dried tomatoes, pesto, grated Parmesan.. You can make one helluva burger.\n\nThe service was great, the beef was cooked extremely well and the view of the city and light rail made for very interesting people watching through their large double pane Windows.\n\nOnly downside imo is location. Parking is a bit tough, but don't let that deter you. Check it out and tell them Chris sent you.\n\nOk, don't tell them that. They probably have no idea who I am.
