Having had my hair completely miscolored and shabbily cut at a salon in Henderson that shall remain nameless, I was unsure of where to turn next in my quest for gorgeous, shiny locks.\n\nAnd then someone told me about Globe Salon. So I quickly made an appointment to get a partial highlight and cut and then squirmed with a mixture of anticipation and fear for 14 days.\n\nWhen I drove up the strip to my appointment and arrived at the apparently designated address, I had two thoughts: \"Wait, where the hell was this place?\" and \"Oh god, I'm in the ghetto.\" Street parking was available on Hoover and I found a spot that didn't specify 2 hours only. I stumbled up and down Hoover and looked around for the invisible salon while several homeless people asked me for money, the use of my cell phone, or preferably both. I was not happy and was thisclose to calling the whole thing off, getting in my car, and drowning my sorrows in a fattening Dairy Queen blizzard, size large.\n\nAnd then I saw the tiny writing on one of the windows in a huge, blank building: Globe Salon. While the building is technically on Las Vegas Blvd, the doorfront faces Hoover Street. I quickly fended off someone threatening to throw their shoe at me because I didn't have any spare cash to give them and raced through the doors.\n\nA total sweaty mess at that point, the receptionist at the desk treated me with kindness. He handed me over the Complimentary Beverage Menu and told me to choose something I liked. Complimentary Beverage Menu? Really? I've been in nice salons before, and I've only ever been offered water or weak coffee. Excited and overwhelmed, I pondered the vast menu choices and decided upon...water. Because I'm an unimaginative tool.\n\nFairly quickly, I met my stylist, Gina. She was a sweet and talkative woman who really took the time to put up with me explaining my preferences and the history of my hair. I felt like a royal pain in the ass as I went into over-detail that my hair was \"naturally crazy wavy\" and I preferred \"piecy, stripey highlights\" that were neither \"blended nor chunky\" and I hated \"warm\" blondes in my hair and preferred something \"cooler\" but not necessarily \"platinum\" and I liked \"blended layers\" that were still \"lengthy\" and....and...the list went on. I wasn't meaning to sound like a jerk, but I know my hair well, and I was also still baffled and shakey by the terrible job the Henderson stylist had done on me.\n\nGina was awesome. She listened to everything I had to say, explained her action plan on how we were going to achieve it, and then got straight to work on mixing up the dye. I immediately opened up my magazine and started reading - I'm the least social person in a hairstylist chair that I know. I absolutely dread small talk with stylists and prefer to zone out to reading bad sex tips in Cosmo. But Gina surprised me. She actually ended up winning me over with her sunny personality, and I found myself closing my magazine and chatting animatedly with her about various topics.\n\nSo my stylist had the gift of gab, but how did the hair turn out? After it was foiled, toned, washed, deep conditioned (my hair is still not used to the dryness of Vegas), cut and blow dryed with a curling brush....it looked positively magnificent. Super shiney, perfect gorgeous piecy highlights in just the right shade of blonde for me, cut at just the right length with all the right face framing pieces. I nearly squealed. No wait...I did squeal. Gina spent a few extra minutes with me explaining the products that she used on my hair, and gave me a few styling tips with the new cut. I genuinely like most of the hair products I own already, but I did invest in the Oribe Deep Conditioning Hair Masque as well as the Bumble and Bumble Spray-In Hair Lotion (it's detangling, conditioning, and infused with tea tree oil). Gina was not pushy about selling me the hair products at all, which I appreciate, because I feel some stylists just recommend various bottles of crap so they can drive up their commission. Instead, I really felt like she was trying to right-fit me with the appropriate products so I can improve my hair.\n\nI paid my bill which was neither cheap nor expensive. $180 for a cut and partial highlights for long and thick hair. I gave Gina a hug goodbye, a tip, and a promise that I will definitely be returning.
