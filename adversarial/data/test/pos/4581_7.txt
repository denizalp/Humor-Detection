Probably my least favorite of all of the Spring Training facilities I've been to, and I come watch my Giants play ball every March.\n\n- Most parks have vendors that that unique to them. The ones at Camelback Ranch are the ones you'll find everywhere: Vienna Beef, Carly's Italian Ice, that nasty Lemonade, etc.\n- The advertised Dodgers Dogs don't taste anything like the dogs I've had at Dodgers Stadium. Lower-quality beef and the standard white bun. Nice try.\n- Street traffic getting in and out of the facility is one of the worst in the Cactus League.\n- No cup holders in the seats!\n- The parking lots are just dusty dirt fields.\n\nOn the other hand, ticket prices are pretty darned cheap!
