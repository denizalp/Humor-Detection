Bartender shame! I really have enjoyed this place until tonight when the bartender call my best friends \" queens\" not knowing anything about them. Totally inappropriate and disrespectful!!   Get some class and tolerance. Bartender, Please continue to boast yourself as the girlfriend of the Owners son...I only hope they are ashamed of your verbiage. On another note, appreciate that you told my catholic friend celebrating lent, \"she wouldn't know the difference\" in meat or not. Thank you for offending a multitude of religion and sexual preferences.... Shame shame shame on you.
