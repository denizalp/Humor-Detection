Group fun at Cantina.... OH YEA... we got the fish bowl room!  Just be careful you don't run into the awkwardly placed glass partition.  Dinner was wicked good!  I had the veggie something or nother... Tasted fried, so I'm good!  Everyone at the table (8 or us) was pleased with everything that they ordered.  The waitress was very attentive even though our group seemed to have overwhelmed her a wee bit!  I do like this place a good bit, so if you're looking for a great lil mexican restaurant then definitely check it out.  I've never heard of anyone having a bad experience there!  Check out the Dragonberry cocktail!  It's spectacular!    Make reservations, they book up quick!
