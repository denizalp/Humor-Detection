You can probably call it an obsession but I've watched every episode of Kitchen Nightmares religiously, so it should go without saying that the most anticipated portion of my most recent getaway trip included a visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak. I will preface to say that as I'm writing this review, I will try not to let my love for the man to color what should be an unbiased opinion based solely on the food, service, and ambiance.\n\nIf you walk through the front of Paris, head towards the middle of the casino, and you will not miss its sign, its incredibly red decor, and beautiful hostesses in tight, black dresses. To add to the dining experience, one of the ladies opened the door for us, escorted us in through what is supposed to represent the \"Chunnel station\" while explaining that we were leaving Las Vegas and being transported to England to dine at GR's homeland. Inside the restaurant, a large Union Jack Flag is painted on the ceiling with a red neon sculpture below it depicting Ramsay's hand movements when preparing his signature Beef Wellington. The open view kitchen, the two-story dining area, the bar - everything - was aesthetically breathtaking. The vibe was a mix of romantic, sexy, lively, intimate, and while it didn't feel casual because of the dress code, the guests seemed relaxed and happy.  \n\nService at Steak was impeccable. We were served by an incredible team who were all polite and well-mannered, and each course was brought out in perfect timing; there was no sense of rush\/urgency between to turn over tables quickly. After already wow'ing us with a drink menu presented on iPads complete with pictures, ingredients, and prices, staff proudly showed off a trolley to each diner's table that put on display stunning cuts of meats served. Although most of his speeches were scripted, our waiter Mathew was an absolute delight and very efficient. He maintained a pleasant aura that shined through the uniform attire, and he even joked with us as I was signing the check. \n\nLast but not least, I can say with confidence that Steak served us a solid meal including 2 alcoholic beverages, 2 appetitizers, 2 entrees, and a dessert that we shared.\n\n--BREAD: A complimentary bread plate was served to start off our meal. To its side was a circular cut of butter with a deliberate sprinkled line of volcanic salt. The butter was soft but it held its shape and had a little bit of flavor. The grains of volcanic salt added to the texture and gave each bite a burst of subtle flavor.\n\n-- DRINKS: I was told the popular drink amongst the female diners was the strawberry martini, so I ordered myself one while my friend had the Southside. The strawberry martini was a tad bit sweet, and the alcohol was noticeable but not overwhelming. My friend seemed indifferent to his, and there seemed to be too much going on with the mint leaves and lime.\n\n-- APPETIZERS: We were first served the Kurobuta Pork Belly after we were done with our fill of bread. Let's just say it knocked my friend's shoes off because every last bite was devoured and bit of sauce was licked clean. The Mac and Cheese was served with our entrees. It had a creamy and soft bottom masked by a crispy top. The blue cheese, cheddar, parmesan and truffle made the dish heavy, but the sweet peas helped by adding a bit of contrast. The flavor was a combination of sweet and savory best consumed fresh. I say fresh only because I took home a quarter of what was left home, and when I heated it up, all of the cheeses liquified into an inedible, salty mess.\n\n-- ENTREES: I thought I needed some spoiling, so I ordered myself a Japanese A5 Kobe (not real Japanese Kobe beef, mind you). My goodness, it was like butter dissolving on my palate. The flavor was subtle, and the richness of texture was absolutely divine. My friend was kind enough to share with me his Beef Wellington. I wasn't particularly excited to try it because I initially assumed it to be just meat stuffed in a puff pastry. However, I was floored when I had my first bite. I'm told the meat is prepared by being coated in a mushroom paste (\"duxelle\") and prosciutto before being tucked into a puff pastry; the wellington is served with potato puree, red wine demi-glaze, and garnish. Execution was flawless.\n\n-- DESSERT: If we hadn't already been spent from the dishes before, the Sticky Toffee Pudding helped us achieve the ultimate finish to our episode of multiple foodgasms. The brown bread pudding was excellent at absorbing the flavors of the toffee and butter; the insides were soft, warm, and moist. Combined with the flavor and temperature difference of the brown butter ice cream shaped into a stick of butter, the dessert was out-of-this-world. Easily my favorite part of the meal!\n\nIf you want to treat yourself out to something special, head over to Gordon Ramsay Steak. Every detail in flavor and presentation was accounted for and well worth the $300 for our meal.
