Don't like to downgrade ratings but last couple of times here food and service has fallen so have to ding them a star.  Tonight's dinner service took about 3 hours to finish and that is with constantly asking about missing food;(\n\nWould get first couple of dishes then wait 15 mins and nothing. Kept asking about the food, get a bunch then wait, ask again...   Eat, wait, ask, repeat....\n\nFood was not bad but hard to enjoy a meal like this.\n\n3\/5
