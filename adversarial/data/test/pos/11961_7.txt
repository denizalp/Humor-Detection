Dang. Duh -HAng \n\nThis is goo foo! \n\nMy mom is deathly allergic to shellfish. That, and I grew up in a desert for 10 of my formative years. When I think of shellfish, I think of slightly forbidden, delicious little delicacies. While growing up the idea of lobster and crab was the ultimate indulgence in haught cuisine, it seemed. \n. \nThe only time my Mom liked fish is when it didn't taste like fish. \"I like swordfish because it's not fishy\", or \"ooh orange roughy is so good! It's not fishy at all\". \n\nI wanted fishy fish. I wanted something that tasted like the ocean. I wanted to see why lobster and crab was so expensive. \n\nIn more selfish and morbid moments I hoped a chef would accidentally drop a shrimp into her food so she would die, and I could eat all the seafood I wanted. \n\nThere's no lobster at Oscar's Pier 83, but you can get things here that are really rare in Arizona, and plenty of it is exquisitely fishy, in the freshest way imaginable. \n\nI did takeout and I ordered a lot of food: \nOscar's Ultimate Combo (1 Jumbo Shrimp, 1 Jumbo Sea Scallop, 1 Oyster, 1 House Fish, 1 Chicken Strip, 1\/4 pound Fried Clam Strips, Fries, Cole Slaw) \nTHEN \nFried Soft-shell Crab \nCrab cake \nClam Chowder \n\nIt was all at least 4 stars. \n\nThe Exquisite: \nThe Fried Oyster- My god this was good. Keep in mind I told you I like fishy fish, but this thing was fresh, juicy, full of meat, and perfectly matched my seafood craving. I thought it was a scallop at first, which is one of my favorite things on earth- but it was so much better than any scallop I've ever had. \nThe Fried Soft Shell Crab- This was served with a pink remoulade like sauce that was divine. This thing was meaty, a little salted, and perfectly flavored. The remoulade was excellent. \nThe Crab cake- It had a ton of crab in it. The only one I've had that was better was in Maryland overlooking the water. Dipped in the remoulade this more than just good. \nThe Clam Chowder- It spilled in the car, in the bag, so I brought it in and ate the chowder with a spoon out of the bag. It was that good. \n\nThe Very Good- \nThe House Fish- Really good. Probably the best I've had. What's weird is that I think the excellence of the oyster and soft shell crab overshadowed this. Had I had this on it's own I'd probably be raving about it. It wasn't fishy at all. \nThe Scallop- It was a little dry and bland. Very big however. \nThe Shrimp- Better than a lot of shrimp I've had in Arizona- but not the best I've ever had. \nThe Chicken Strip- Had I been more present at the time of ordering I would have tried to substitute this for something else. \n\nWhen I go again, I will order the soft shell crab, 3 oysters, and some clam chowder. \n\nMaybe I'll bring in my mom and Oscar will be the one to finally do her in with a stray piece of shrimp (DEVIL LAUGH). I kid, I kid.
