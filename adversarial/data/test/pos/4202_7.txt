QuikTrip is doing a great job at raising the quality of gas station convenience stores. This one is bright, clean, well stocked, well priced and has a very nice and wide covered pump area.\n\nGreat selection of drinks and snacks plus a large made-to-order sandwich area.\n\nGas prices are very competitive.\n\nOne point off for the receipt printer at the pump not working.
