We dined here for my birthday on 2\/13. We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. We got a very nice table with corner bench seating, so we could sit side by side. \n\nOur server was efficient and very friendly. We were served the complimentary chicken pate. Sorry to say, I am not a fan of pate, but it was a very nice touch. Next came the legendary popovers. I understand that these are Chef Tourondel's signature. They were so amazing. \n\nWe decided to share the crab cake appetizer. It was served with remoulade and spicy coleslaw. I can't say enough about how delicious it was! The slaw and the crab was a perfect combination. It was definitely the best crab cake that I ever have eaten. The best! Since it was my birthday, I went a little crazy with birthday drinking. I had \"The Fountain of Youth\" which was delicious. Can't remember any of the ingredients, but it's an amazing drink. \n\nFor dinner, I had the filet mignon. Oh, my. It was perfectly cooked, and so tender and delicious with the right amount of char. I opted for the chimichurri sauce which was SO good. BJ opted for the 3 lb. lobster. Wholly, mother of lobster, it was huge and perfectly prepared. And even more amazing, he was able to eat it all. Well, I helped a bit. For sides, we selected grilled asparagus and a baked potato. The potato was served with add your own sour cream, chives, cheese and bacon. The sides were huge and meant for sharing. \n\nEven though we were full, we couldn't not pass on dessert. We had the warm chocolate tart served with pistachio ice cream. Wow, it was so good. Also, they were thoughtful enough to serve this complimentary with a nice bday inscription on the plate complete with candle. How nice. Another thoughtful touch was a letter with the Chef thanking us for dining there and a promise of 10% off on our next visit. Wow, that's sweet!  Also, the complimentary dessert cookies were also very nice!\n\nAs the other yelp reviewers have mentioned, this restaurant is expensive and best reserved for special occasions. However, my birthday experience here is one that will never be forgotten. It was amazing!!  Thanks BLT!
