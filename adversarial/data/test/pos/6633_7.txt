Sometimes size DOES matter, and when it does, bigger is better!\n\nI was planning a date night for a recent Thursday night, and I wanted to go bowling. I didn't want to deal with bowling leagues taking up all of the lanes, so I specifically looked for a large bowling alley... Strike Zone Bowling Center is the largest alley in town, with 72 lanes! I figured there was no way all those lanes would be taken... and when we arrived we were happy to see that while there was a lot of people bowling, there was no wait for a lane.\n\nWe paid for 2 games and rented some shoes from a friendly enough employee, then grabbed some balls  and got down to business. We didn't use bumpers, but I thought it was really cool that you could specify if the person bowling wanted them (making this a great spot to take kiddies!). We didn't get any food or booze, but for those that want to there is a snack bar and a separate bar. \n\nAnother reason to love Strike Zone: 1.50 games after 9 pm on Monday-Thursday!\nI'm looking forward to going back to check out Cosmic Bowling on a Friday or Saturday night soon!
