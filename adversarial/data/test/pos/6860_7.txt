I am over the moon about Craft opening! I stopped in last night for their opening night and WOW was I impressed at the beautiful job they have done with this space! The best way to describe this place is Common Market and Good Bottle Co had a baby and she is perfect. \n\nAmbiance and Decor - The building is brick painted white, their great logo in black on the front and then market lights are over the biergarten with about 8 picnic tables. The look is fresh, clean and inviting, we all couldn't help but snap a photo. \n\nOnce you enter you are greeted by a U-shaped bar with the first portion dedicated to their food menu, the main portion dedicated to their 36 beers on tap and seating wraps around the rest of the bar. \n\nFood - Since it was opening night we didn't get a chance to try their food and trust me, we were DYING to get a charcuterie platter. The menu is simple, charcuterie platters, flatbread sandwiches and flatbread pizza. They also have a deli display of local cheeses and meats from around NC which I can't wait to dive into. The flatbread sandwiches have savory and sweet options (I am pretty sure the Nutella with banana will be a huge hit). \n\nThere is a grocery type section with a variety of local treats and I wanted to take each and every one of them home. I could see myself stopping in to pick up a growler and some treats for a great gift basket. \n\nBeer - There are 36 beers on tap and half of those are dedicated to local brews. You can enjoy your beers in the biergarten or inside at one of their wooden tables, there is plenty of room to sit! If you want to back beers up and take them home you can have growlers filled or select from their shelves of bottles ready to go. \n\nBottom Line: You should check out Craft. They are a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and I can not wait to spend more time here (especially when the new wine and dessert spot opens up next door. Yes please!)
