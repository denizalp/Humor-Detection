I was a cardholder in our neighboring state for many years and can assure you that Euphoria is running a good, orderly operation.  The place is clean and the employees are friendly.  Some of the posters below seem to complain about silly issues.  What did they want from security guards, a fixed smile and some weather conversation?   Where did they expect to wait since the lobby was full?  Give the place credit for supplying shade and cold water.  Much ado about nothing.\n\nWhen you break down the price per gram, an eighth ounce was about $60, similar to top shelf bud in a lot of California dispensaries.  Hopefully they will eventually get more inventory and have some product a notch or two below premium bud as well as some daily specials.  There were no edibles available yet, so time will tell on that.  They do sell very convenient pre-rolled joints and the potency was satisfactory.  A few tokes was all that was necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, everything seemed to be smooth and normal for a startup.  There was a sort of ma√Ætre d' named Trent who greeted and seated patrons and he was very personable, as were the other workers.  \n\nMy reason for giving only 4 stars was their weak reaction to the guy outside who tried to con buyers into selling him some of their purchase.  I would have liked to see security call police right away to make an arrest in order to send the public a message.  They did get his license plate number but that's not enough.  To their credit, they were alert and knew what the guy was doing.  But you cannot just tell a person like that to scram and expect him to not repeat his actions.  They need to tighten this up or there will be problems down the road.
