I honestly don't see what the hype is about with this 'chili'. It looks like dog food & doesn't look very appetizing when it's slapped on over cooked noodles.\n\nThe only things that make the chili somewhat edible is the mound of cheese & hot sauce. \n\nAt least the employees were very nice & helpful though.
