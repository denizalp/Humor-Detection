John has been cutting my hair for about 8 yrs now. He has become a close friend who has invited me out for lunch and to his home. He truly cares about his customers and knows what is best for them. His jokes are hilarious too. He cares about his trait (just ask him to show you the House of Commons video tape) and is obviously well respected by his community and his patrons. I've left and forgotten to pay, paid him with car parts, and tire discounts. He is also a car guy like me and teaches me everything I need to know about the mechanics of how cars operate. Keep up the great work John. Your friend,\nDavid
