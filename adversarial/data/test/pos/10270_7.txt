This is no longer a Sam's Mart and Shell station. It has been rebranded as a 7-Eleven with Mobil products.\n\nThe station is on the corner of Fort Mill Highway and US 521, which is generally a busy intersection. It's also one of the first stations as you cross over from North Carolina into South Carolina, so you're going to save about 18 cents a gallon in state gas tax. GasBuddy has them as pretty competitive compared to the other stations in the vicinity.
