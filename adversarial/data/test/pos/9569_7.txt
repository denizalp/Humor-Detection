Been here several times.\n\nBought an Opera cake for my bf's birthday a couple years ago here: it was fresh, delicious and moist, reminiscent of a tiramisu in texture and taste but different and delightful in its own respect. Good quality for a good price. \n\nSince then I've been back mostly with clients from work. For coffees and pastries. All delicious, served by the extremely sweet gentlemen that work there. They allow you to relax and are always happy to serve you at your table...they didn't even look annoyed when the elder gentleman next to us spilled his whole cup of coffee on the ground and dude guy came to clean it, still with a smile. \n\nLast visit I tried the samossas cuz I was starving....i was skeptical when they didn't have the usual sweet sauce that accompanies samossas...i was even more skeptical when they put them into the panini press to heat them up....But they were soooo delicious! At a very reasonable 1.35 per samossa I will be back for sure for these tasty lil buggars. \n\nStill discovering all they have to offer but lovin it more and more... Will keep comin back. \n\n(P.S. Mariko: this was the pastry place i mentioned in a previous conversation!)
