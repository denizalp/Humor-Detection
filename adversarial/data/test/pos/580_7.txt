It pleases me when somewhere gets what it deserves review-wise on yelp. The YMCA is most deserving of its 5 star status. Not only for an affordable $67 (I think, too lazy to check my visa statement here) a month do you get a top notch fitness facility with basketball court, squash courts, track, studios and pool, you also get top notch service. The staff are friendly, helpful and even funny and zany in a charming-a**hole kind of way. Take for example, volunteer who always gives me a girls membership when I turn my lock in. A sauna is included in the general admission locker room which is really nice after a work out. \n\nYou also get a wonderful cast of characters who would produce a heck of a reality show. They include guy who looks like a stereotypical Jesus, guy who is clearly on roids, hot girl who knows she's hot and kind of has her nose in the air, guy with spiky punk hair-do and trainer who is an ex-UFC fighter and still maintains the demeanour.  All characters that make me want to continue coming back. The culture is so rich here!\n\nThe YMCA is pretty special to me. It the only thing outside my apartment, save Yelp, that has actually become a part of my life. If I have a bad day there is nothing I would rather do than workout and shoot a few hoops after work. If I ever left I would truly miss it.
