No. I don't want your used grease burger.\n\nWhile I get these other reviews from folks growing up in WI, considering that people have different tastes everywhere, I strongly caution anyone not from here to give it a second thought before purchase. \n\nAll we purchased was a couple of burger baskets but we both walked out without eating more than a single bite of the burgers. The fries were good. What none of these reviews mention is the state of the food that you get or how it is cooked. The burgers, if they were indeed fresh ground, tasted like fast food burgers. Fake. The grease pooled instantly around the bottom of my plate, rendering the \"bun\" a useless sop of nasty. The bacon was undercooked, enough that I wouldn't even eat it off the burger.\n\nImagine how bad that has to be, how greasy and undercooked, that the bacon wasn't pulled free and eaten. I don't know people who would leave bacon behind, I certainly never would have otherwise.\n\nAll in all, it might be a great place for folks accustomed to eating dripping mounds of slush or if you have a sudden craving to eat a burger with a spoon. For everyone else, as disgusted as I am to say it, I'd eat Wendy's. \n\nWe did not stop to complain and get our money back.\n\nThat said, the folks there seemed really nice and it was nothing but smiles. Helpful staff to explain how seating and ordering goes.
