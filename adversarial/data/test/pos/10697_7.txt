I didn't have my cam the last time I ate at PJ, but old pics never die.\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/KFhou4roVjI\n\nUsually I get a Veggie Lavash Wrap with wood-fired vegetables of eggplant, zucchini, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, arugula, pesto, garlic sauce. It comes with side Greek Salad and is rather filling.\n\nThis time, though, I ordered something light; wood-fired Lavash Pizza. Sounds good, right? \n\nIt came topped with mushrooms, bell peppers, tomatoes, kalamata olives, herbs, cheese, baby arugula, and balsamic all on a thin lavash crust. It was simple but tasty because the salty toppings breathed life into the flat(lined) lavash, and I managed to gobble it down even faster than I imagined my already full belly could do. \n\nOn top of that I shared a slice of Carrot Cake and then ordered another slice for myself. There's something about pineapple chunks, carrot shavings, walnuts, and cream cheese frosting that never gets old. Yum yum.
