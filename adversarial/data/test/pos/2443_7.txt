After years of using this company for all our vacation travel, we are done with them. They were never fantastic, but the bookings went fine and I was used to the website.\n\nLast year after we were downgraded from our reserved room class at a resort, we were given a voucher to claim a refund from itravel2000. Three phone calls went unreturned and we were given the runaround and never received our refund.\n\nThe last two phone conversations I have had with them, just inquiring about our bookings, were curt and completely unhelpful. The women on the phone had that distinct \"I couldn't care less about you\" tone to their voices, which is not what I'm looking for when we have a $15,000 trip booked through them.\n\nThere is lots of competition out there - selloffvacations.com, tripcentral.ca come immediately to mind - and I will be booking with one of them on our next trip in the hopes of not being treated like total garbage.
