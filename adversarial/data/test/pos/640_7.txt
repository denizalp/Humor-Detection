I love Tommy's! Yum, yum, yummy!\n\nI am so excited that we actually have Tommy's in Vegas now.  It used to always be one of my first stops whenever I was in Cali, so having it in town is a blessing, in my book.  It is nicer to just drive across town instead of across state lines!  \n\nI am a big fan of pretty much anything smothered in chili and cheese, so this place is nirvana for me.  You will definitely be full after eating a combo meal.  The burgers are big, juicy, and so messy.  The hot dogs are huge and just covered is delicious goodness.  And the fries, well all I can really say is DROOL...Everything comes with chili and cheese, but you can order things without it as well, if that isn't your thing, though why would you not want chili and cheese??? \n\nOn top of great food, the staff is always really friendly and cheerful.  It is so nice to be helped by someone who actually is happy, smiling, and fun to talk too.  Great customer service is always a big bonus for me.  I wish more food joint like this had friendly people working at them.\n\nSo the moral of the story is that you need to get to Tommy's ASAP!  And to bring a bib because the amazingly, delicious, gooey chili and cheese will most likely get everywhere when you are eating a fantastic burger!
