Have you ever been happy just to get the heck out of somewhere? I had that feeling tonight at Red Robin. My wife was craving a loaded cheeseburger so along with my 2 year old off we went. Being a Friday night the parking lot was almost full, my wife and I took the last two open spaces as she met us there. Once we stepped inside things went South. Rather than write war and peace let's just drop the facts: \n\n1: They called that iced tea? \n2: You quit carrying spinach and artichoke dip? WTF? \n3: The Mushrooms \/ Zucchini appetizer picture had to be Photoshopped. What we got, well the mushrooms were edible. The zucchini was, well, ugh!\n4: Normally the Fish and Chips are good. I've had them in Kansas City, Denver, and Vegas. Tonight's batch failed. Blah, boring, undercooked. Why mince words, it sucked. \n5: I asked for malt vinegar sauce. 3 requests later someone finally gets it. \n6: I would like my steak fries to be warm, preferably when they come to the table I want them hot enough when served that I don't want to keep my fingers on them for long. What I got made me wonder if the cook was celebrating 4\/20 prior to coming to work. \n7: 1.19 for two lame little bitty slices of avacado that looked like it was on it's last legs? Really? Pathetic. \n8: My 2 year old thought the mac and cheese sucked. He ate two bites, thankfully the orange they served with it was good as that's all he ate. And it's hard to make kids food suck but they rose to the occasion. \n9: On the way out we had to walk past a bunch of servers and a manager who wouldn't clear a path and they were talking about a large party that came in. The manager said and I quote \"I don't know where in the f*** to sit them, either they wait or they can sit on the damn floor\". \n\nNeedless to say I was happy to leave. Thankfully the Cupcakery that shares the same parking lot was still open to provide some sustenance that actually tasted good.  \n\nOn my way home the way my stomach feels it made me wonder if I might need some Syrup of Ipecac before the night's over. \n\n2 Stars: Our server was overworked but tried his best. And 1 star goes for the TV's that let me see the end of the Giants \/ Mets game.
