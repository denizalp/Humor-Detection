First off, when you're talking about \"service\" car washes such as Super Star, I think it's important to keep your expectations realistic. In other words, don't go in here expecting to plunk down 25 bucks and receive a professional detail job where your vehicle looks virtually flawless upon pickup. It's just simply not going to happen. And sometimes, when I read some of these reviews, I feel that a lot of people are just simply expecting way, way too much from these places.\n\nBut then I look at some of the pictures and realize that maybe, just maybe, if the crew would be willing to spend just a bit more attention to detail, they wouldn't have to defend all of these negative Yelp reviews they receive.\n\nI've been to this location several times. The first thing I'd like to point out is that, like most car washes, don't be fooled by their tiered system. Just because you paid for a more expensive wash doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to give any extra attention to your car. Yes, they may add more items to the washing and drying process, but that doesn't mean that they're going to vacuum or wipe down your interior with anymore elbow grease than they would by opting for the cheapest wash. On some occasions, my car has actually looked cleaner after a low-end wash than it does the premium. It's mainly a gamble, with the quality of the work being largely dependent on how lazy or how productive the crew is on that particular day.\n\nPersonally, I don't care about time. I couldn't care less if it takes ten minutes or sixty minutes. I just want my car to be clean.  And while expecting a full detail job is admittedly unrealistic for 25 dollars, I do feel that they should at least be responsible for cleaning up trash and vacuuming up crumbs. And believe it or not, there have been many instances where they're cutting way too many corners. It's almost as if they're not really targeting anything specifically. They just slap some glossy gunk on your dash and quickly run the vacuum over your seats to suck up whatever they can get in about twenty seconds. Don't expect more than that, which is pretty sad given the prices they're asking.\n\nThis establishment has Yelp signs posted, encouraging angry customers to talk to the managers before posting their negative reviews online. Clearly, they're well aware that they receive many poor reviews from customers. And while I'm sure management thinks they can reduce this, don't you feel that simply upping the quality of the work would be a more effective long-term solution? I don't know about you, but the last thing I want to do is start scolding crew members for not doing their jobs in 115 degree heat. That's not my job, but the responsibility of the management to ensure that they become more consistent with the work that the crew is performing.\n\nAfter visiting this location several times, I don't feel that the detail, or lack thereof, that they provide is worth the cost they're asking. If I spend 25 dollars to have my car washed, and then proceed to spend my Sunday afternoon cleaning up donut crumbs and paper trash that they failed to pick up themselves, then clearly there's something very wrong with the way that this establishment does business.\n\nI guess the old saying rings true. If you want something done right, you're better off just doing it yourself.  \n\nNot recommended.
