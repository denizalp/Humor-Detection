3-Stars and that's just for the deep-fried Oreos (the twinkie is ok) but the Oreos are a steal at 3 for a buck! Waited in line for the first time yesterday when I took my dad and his girlfriend who were in town visiting. Nothing bad to say about the Oreos (when they are willing to make them for you). One time the guy told me to come back in 45 minutes, I came back and it was a different guy (shift change) and he told me it would be 30 minutes!\n\nI feel for them in a weird way working in this dump of a place but come on... you got a great opportunity to make some decent tips with a friendly and outgoing demeanor. Especially with the number of people that go through there just to try the twinkies and oreos. The staff yesterday was ok. One girl was pretty friendly and kind but the other girl seemed mad at the world.\n\nAlso as mentioned in another review... the so called Nathan's hot dogs didn't taste like any Nathans brand hotdog I have ever had but for 99cents its not bad. They should just stop advertising it as Nathans (no point if they are that cheap anyway). \n\nThe casino itself is dirty, smelly, filled with some miserable looking people and employees, and in a strange way somewhat enjoyable.....\n\nbut maybe thats the Oreos talking.
