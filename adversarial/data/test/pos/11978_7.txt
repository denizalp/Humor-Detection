Great going down... not so great later. \n\nMy roomate and I discovered this place about 2 years ago and since then have eaten there 1\/2 dozen times or so. The cliffs notes is that all the food is delicious, but it is sooo rich\/fatty\/terrible for you that there is usually a great deal of time later spent nursing a stomach ache. Perhaps we are just getting old and can't take it anymore but we had to stop going because it just wasn't worth the tears.\n\nLet me explain more- we basically focused our ordering on things on the menu that have both pork belly and garlic mayonaise- so it could just be the combination of these two ingrediants that is waging a thermo nuclear war on our insides- but damnit those are the best things on the menu- what are we supposed to do eat some vegetables? Not in America chief. \n\n\nThe inside- not very glamorous or inviting- definately a take out style place.
