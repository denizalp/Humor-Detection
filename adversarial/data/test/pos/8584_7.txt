This place is 5 stars upon arrival and like 3 stars at departure time. \n\nWhen the plane lands, I can already feel it. I've been waiting patiently for the doors to open so we can get our Vegas on. I mean, the moment we walk through the doors we are speed walking to get a cab. I don't even know if I have ever noticed anything about the airport when I arrive. I couldn't tell you the color scheme, what food is offered, nothin'!\n\nWhen we head back here to go home, I am moving in slow mo. I notice everything! I notice the stench, the outdated decor, the paint peeling and on and on it goes. The food options suck, I don't feel like eating at Blimpies, the place smells like a urinal biscuit and I just want to get the hell away from here asap!!\n\nThis is one of those places that has traffic like you couldn't imagine. But they don't need to spend a dime on the airport b\/c what are gonna do, stop going to Vegas b\/c the airport sucks? Stop having bachelor parties here b\/c the airport furniture is outdated? Nope.
