Domo arigato Dolce Gelato!\n\nMe loves me a good gelato, and this new location in Greek town does the trick!  The best part is they allow for two flavours with a small cup.  I love my frozen treats, but I really don't need much of it to satisfy me.  Here I managed to have to my favo-combo of Oreo Cookie dough and Tiramisu.  Score!\n\nIt's a perfect last stop after a meaty souvy meal.\n\nhttp:\/\/app.toronto.ca\/food2\/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=10398984
