I have been to many hookah lounges, and this one is hands down the cleanest. Layla's has awesome food and drinks. The hookah is great too, they have many common classic flavors as well as their own twists. The customer service is amazing too. Always tending to the coals and making sure you're good on food and drink. It's a must try!
