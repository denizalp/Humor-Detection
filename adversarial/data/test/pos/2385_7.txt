Bruh. The carne asada in the beast burrito was trash. The elote was over priced but was the only saving grace to this god awful place my boyfriend and I tried on a whim. Couldn't get a drink refill for the life of me, but after I'm finished with my meal the waitress decides to refill my drinks. $12 for a cardboard burrito. I enjoyed writing this painfully honest review more than I did the food. \n\nOn the bright side if you love dubstep and terrible remixes of Sam Smith and Adele you'll fit right in with the try hard atmosphere.
