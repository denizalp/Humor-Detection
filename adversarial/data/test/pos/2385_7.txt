Came here while on vacation. I saw the restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares and wanted to check it out. We just ordered a plain cheese pizza and salad. I'm from Chicago and we know pizza. We got our pizza and the dough\/crust was still raw and soggy in a lot of areas. How do,you mess up a simple cheese pizza? We left the pizza ate our salads and left. This place is simply open because it's on it's 14th minute of fame. There are many great Italian restaurants in the area Yelpers. Check em out instead!
