This branch must be the weakest branch from Grimaldi's. How do I know? I did Grimaldi's patented pizza pie test. So you should test it out for yourself and make the decision. \n\n1. Hold your pizza pie up by the crust and it must lie perpendicular to you. The slice was slagging. Grade C-\n2. Make sure the ingredients\/ toppings remain on the pie. It started to droop off the dough within several seconds. Grade C- \n3. When you bite into the pie, make sure there's a crunch. No crunch to be found. Grade D\n4. With the bite, steam should be coming out of your mouth. Indeed it did A. \n\nI'm sad to say, all the key components are there at Grimaldi Summerlin. I think it's all a matter of execution. Side note, the service is not the greatest from the host\/bartender. We arrived to an empty dining area but the bartender and host simply chose to ignore us over their chit chat.
