Everythint about my experience at this salon was amazing. As someone with thick wavy hair, its always been a challenge to find someone to do my hair well.  However , at lisadinhs this was not the case. \n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I was offered muffins, conversation and someone to take my coat away.\nAs a sat in the chair, my colourist\/stylist, who was Olivia, listened to what I wanted done (ash beige balayage highlights), she asked it I had any pictures and recreated the whole thing. She is a very sweet girl and it was very enjoyable to talk to her throughout the process. At the end, when she was styling my hair she also allowed me to show her a pic of the way I wanted it done (tousled beach waves) and without a doubt she was able to recreate that too. The final product was amazing.  Olivia also explained how to maintain my ash hair and offered me multiple product choices that I could buy, which was very appreciated. \n\nAlso- In the process of my hair session, despite the fact that I wasn't booked with Lisa, she greeted herself to me and kept asking me if everything was going alright\/if I needed anything. I thought this was a very sweet and warming touch as she is the owner and was busy with another client but she still made the time to make sure my experience went well.\n\nOverall, I am so happy with my hair and the experience here.\nThis was my first time here but I will definitely be coming back.
