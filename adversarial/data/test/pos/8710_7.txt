I sure didn't experience all the hate people are posting.  I ordered lunch to go for my office.  I called it in and was told it would be about 25 minutes for 5 dishes.  More than a reasonable amount of time.  When I arrived I was greeted by a happy hostess and sent to the bar for pickup.  The order was ready for us upon arrival.  When we got back to the office there were no errors and the food was still warm.  We all got something a little different and were all pleasantly surprised about the thought and quality that went into their food.  It was definitely made with love!  I got the chicken parmesan pasta with a fresh bright marinera sauce.  The pasta was lovely.  Others ordered the chicken sandwich, chicken alfredo, chicken and pesto, and spaghetti with meatballs.  No complaints here!  The serving sizes were more than generous and each item came with a salad.  The salads were very fresh with no wilted greens at all!  We also received their house braided bread which was awesome!  \nRiazzi's was tired and run down.  I cannot imagine what the carpet looked like when they pulled it out of this place.  Quartiere has a bright and cheery feel.  I encourage everyone who has posted bad comments to give it another try.  Put your nostalgia aside and go with an open mind.
