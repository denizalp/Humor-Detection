Its a shame I have to give it one star. Don't take your dog here for grooming. The service is horrid. The couple that owns the shop are both nuts. They overbook and when you telephone them to check on status, they are rude and will hang up on you. As I was lodging a complaint about that in person at their shop, the husband jumped up and sprinted towards me yelling for me to leave and acting like he was going to get physical. His wife joined in too. They are both crazy. Beware of these two loons.
