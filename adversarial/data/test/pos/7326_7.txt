BACKGROUND \n\nFinding a gorgeous swimsuit that is also well fitting is one of the two clothing dilemmas that women struggle with. The second one is buying jeans. Luckily, I found Beach Bunny Swimwear at Kierland Mall in Scottsdale, so at least one fashion problem is solved. \n\nTHE STORY \n\nI was invited to a pool party a couple weeks ago.\n\nI was really excited about going, until I went through my swimsuit collection. I remember wearing all the suits in my drawer at one point, but they all seemed kind of old and tired. I threw a bunch out and started searching online. \n\nI love shopping online. All of the cutest swimsuits were from BeachBunnySwimwear.com, but I needed the swimsuit within one day. Buying a swimsuit online is a little risky for a last minute thing, due to shipping constraints and what if it doesn't fit?\n\nSo, I went to a few places at the Biltmore, but basically, the selection was limited because it was the end of the summer season and they weren't planning on restocking. Also, most of the swimwear available was just plain boring.\n\nI was explaining to one of the sales women at the shop at the Biltmore how all the swimsuits on the Beach Bunny Swimwear website were exciting with lots of bling and super strappy and original. She told me to go to the Beach Bunny Swimwear store at Kierland Mall. I had no idea they had stores locally. \n\nTHE BEACH BUNNY\n\nThe Beach Bunny store at Kierland is pretty small, so I wasn't sure I would find anything. I told the sales woman what I was looking for and she immediately pulled out 10 different swimsuits. \n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE \n\nEach swimsuit she showed me was prettier than the one before and very original. It was actually very exciting to see such beautiful swimsuits. \n\nHowever, one of the biggest problems for me is that I have wear mixed sizes: a large top and small bottoms. At Beach Bunny, they allow mix and match sizes, so that problem was fixed. \n\nI tried on a bunch of swimsuits and fell in love with three. Then I checked the prices and each swimsuit was around $200. So, I picked my favorite. It turns out they were having a sale and the swimsuit I picked was over half off.\n\nThe staff was extremely helpful.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nMy only complaint is because of the size of the store there isn't a huge selection. But that was really irrelevant because I found so many gorgeous things.\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nAnother great aspect is they keep updating their stock all year round, so you can always be sure to get the latest style at any time.\n\nOF NOTE \n\n*Hours:\nMon - Sat 10am - 9pm\nSun 12pm - 6pm\n\n*For more information:\nBeachBunnySwimwear.com
