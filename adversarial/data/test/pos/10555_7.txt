Brand spanking new location served up just about all that I want in a Doctor's office experience: clean facility, paperwork available online to bring with me to appointment, punctuality and respect for my time, courteous and competent ancillary staff, and a personable, thorough and non-condescending Doctor (Raymond Theodosis) \n\nFrom the Front Desk duo who checked me in to the two techs who tested my eyes, dilated them and took my history, to the Dr, check out and glasses selection tech: everything was pleasant and easy breezy. The physical location is easy on\/off the 215 and close to Baguette Cafe :-) \n\nDr. Theodosis introduced himself, asked good questions and answered all of my queries. He was more than kind considering I only ever have my eyes checked when I lose or break glasses. Needed a driver because my eyes were dilated, and was so impressed, my Mom made appointments with him for Dad and herself before we bounced. \n\nThis spot is less crowded than Summerlin office, though they just opened a few weeks ago. There is a very small selection of frames, but nobody gave me a hard time for not ordering today. Will check the Summahood spot, or another joint for those purposes. \n\nSee ya next year...or, I'll make a concerted effort to not wait 5x as long...
