I LOVE Ronald's Donuts.\n\nThis is my mom's number 1 place to go for donuts even though we don't live in this area. The case is always fully stocked with fresh doughnuts when we go (we always go in the morning). She always gets a dozen of their fluffy and perfectly glazed doughnut holes and I always get a chocolate rainbow sprinkled doughnut, perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. There are always a few regulars eating inside when we go. You can tell they've been regulars for a while because they address the people working there by their names and start asking them things like, \"so how are the kids?\" If I lived in the area and went here a lot, I'd probably be inviting them over for dinner. They're THAT personable and their doughnuts are THAT good ;)
