My husband and I visited Jalapeno Inferno for lunch last weekend and were not very impressed. The restaurant and the patio are nice looking but the food was not as appealing. \n\nThe salsa and chips were \"okay.\"  I wasn't a fan of the chips. I know that many people do but I found the texture to be similar to \"Cinnamon Twists\" at Taco Bell. I prefer crispier chips. But, my husband was a fan so I guess it's just personal preference. \n\nMy husband had the Hatch Green Chile Enchiladas and I had the Anaheim Chile Relleno Platter. I did not like my meal. I could only eat a few bites of the Chile Relleno but I did enjoy my rice and beans. My husband enjoyed his enchiladas but they were not as hot as advertised since they are listed under the \"some like it hot\" portion of the menu. \n\nThey main reason I am giving this restaurant two stars is because of the lack of service. We rarely saw our waitress and the restaurant did not appear busy. She never asked if we needed anything and never refilled our water or beverages. She took our order, dropped off our bill, but never provided any service in between those two events.
