Why hello Pink Box! Welcome to my circle of delicious doughnut finds!!\n\nWas introduced to Pink Box by my cousins and I will be sure it is a staple now during our family visits! Went with a plethora of assorted classic, specialty, & gourmet doughnuts plus a few cronuts - y'know, go BIG or go home!!! \n\nPricing comes in 4-tiers: Classic\/Gourmet\/Specialty\/Cronut\nYou can mix & match to your hearts content. Grabbed 3 dozen for the family and got to try over 14 varieties...some faves?\n\nCampfire s'mores - gourmet category: loved the gooey marshmallow topping. Not too sweet, perfectly paired with a cuppa joe!\nSamoa - gourmet category: was the flavor of the day during our visit. Y-U-M!!!! Awesome take on the classic girl scout cookie.\nCoco Loco - specialty category: I thought this would be too sweet and the coco krispies stale (as I had ordered something similar from a very popular pink boxed donut shop in Portland..no name mentioned but rhymes with boodoo=P). But Pink Box's coco loco was deeeelish! Crunch crunch went my krispies and it was not overly sweet at all. \nBlueberry Cronut - flaky, good blueberry flavor & thumbs up to pink box's version of the cronut\n\nCan never go wrong with the classics - traditional (like old fashioned), chocolate bars, and the sprinkle cake donuts were a huge hit with the kiddos. \n\nWould definitely recommend trying this place out if you're feeling like a decadent donut or just your simple chocolate bar. So many flavors to try I think anyone can find a favorite here!\n\nLocated at the corner of a strip mall, plenty of parking for everyone. Went in the morning and had many choices to choose from.\n\nY'know the mantra:\n\ngood service + deeeelicious doughnuts = thumbs up Pink Box!
