My wife has been shopping here for a while now. I came for the first time recently. There isn't a major chain store that can compare to the prices here. I will say the quality may not be as good, but you can choose the better quality items by taking time to pick through the produce. If you are willing to take the time to look at everything you pick out you can score big savings here, It does get crowded so come with plenty of time to shop.
