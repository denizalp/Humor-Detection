I give this place 1 star due to cheapness & lack of respect for people spending $ in their establishment. They've been open over a year making money hand over fist & still give ghetto packaging in styrofoam containers with foil over the top. This is not acceptable the frozen ice cream sticks to the styrofoam & makes it impossible to scoop out . The styrofoam crumbles when frozen and cracks thus leaving styrofoam in ice cream. Look at the pictures of both mine and my husbands ice cream. Save your money & go somewhere that respects people enough to provide actual cups and lids to their customers.
