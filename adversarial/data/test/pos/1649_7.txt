this place is straight corporate, i brought my wife one night there and maybe i'm of the simpier folk o r at least good home cooking, and this aint...the  gave some weird salad, some weird pasta, and some weird meat, by the time you know it the bill was $250 for two, my wife didnt even touch her food because it sucked. and we went to another restaurant to eat after we left there... do not recomend...only if your boss on Bay st is paying.....
