This was the first Korean restaurant I ever visited, I was a young and naive university student who thought this was the best restaurant ever. I still think its a great restaurant, however I know have eaten at other Korean restaurants only to sadly find out out that Manna is average at best. \n\nNow that you have a the back story you understand why manna holds a special place in my heart. Although their food may not be the best, it is a excellent place for poor students and cheap eaters alike to enjoy some decent Korean food.
