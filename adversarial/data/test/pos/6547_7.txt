I met my yelper buddy Dottsy for happy hour before a show at the Herberger.  This was my first time and hers as well-at the restaurant.  I arrived about 15 minutes early but decided to get a table and start on a cocktail.  I may as well have waited outside as the server was absentee.  When he finally arrived, he did apologize however.\n\nWe ordered the lobster lettuce cups and sweet chili calamari.  The lobster cups were chunks of lobster meat, avocado, and a veggie slaw-really good.  We ordered the calamari at the server's suggestion.  I am not generally a huge fan of calamari, but this was soooo gooood.  Perfectly cooked, and the sweet chili sauce was just enough to give it a little zing, but not overpower the dish.  And the serving was HUGE, and I'm an eater.  I was sorry we didn't have time to finish it.  I considered dumping it in my purse, but not sure the other theater patrons would have appreciated that.\n\nHappy hour prices are great as well.  I think our bill came to $30 for a glass of wine, a specialty drink, and the two appetizers.  Definitely four stars for happy hour in spite of the slow start.  I'll have to try dinner next time.
