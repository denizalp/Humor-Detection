Went here today with friends and family. I love that they have so many different options on the menu that it's perfect for those that are eating healthy and those that are not. Service is always great here as well and I like their lunch specials. Everything on the menu is good priced. \n\nI got the chicken fajitas. It's one of my favorite dishes. Simple but so much flavor. My friends got the quesadilla explosion salad and the margarita salad that  they both enjoyed. My fianc√© tried one of the seasonal BBQ dishes with the sausage and crispers and didn't care for it. It was small portions and pretty bland. \n\nI recommend to go with the classics here food wise, can't go wrong! But great place to have options. Good lunch specials, happy hour, and to go.
