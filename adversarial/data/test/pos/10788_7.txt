Still my favorite buffet on Sunday mornings in Vegas, no question.\n\nBut check to see if it's king crab legs because without those, it loses a star.\n\nhowever, the bread pudding is apparently the recipe from some woman who worked in the Wynn house and is straight up ridiculous and authentic as heck (we have some old school southerners with us to confirm but were unsuccessful in bribing the waitress for the recipe). I recommend vanilla ice cream and the vanilla sauce.\n\noh, and the herring is shocking good (never would have guessed).\n\nHelpful tip: send friends over early to wait in line which you ferry bloody marys back and forth. (it's all about teamwork)
