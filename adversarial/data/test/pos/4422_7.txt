Horrible. Worst burger if you can call it that ......that I've ever had. The patty was squished to the thickness of a piece of bacon. Then on top of that all around the burger was burnt. It was like eating a burger full of crumbles that was left in the pan after you cook it. Cheesy hash browns were good but the burger ruined it for me.
