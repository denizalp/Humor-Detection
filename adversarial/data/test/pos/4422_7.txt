I have gone to polish 3 times now. My last visit was Friday 1\/13\/12. I am pleased with my service of a full set of pink and whites and a pedicure. I'm unsure if I will be back seeing as they are already breaking. some of the staff made it not an enjoyable. \n\nOn my second visit ther susana came up to my nail technician and Rudely told her and the technicians around me not to speak Vietnamese because it made me uncomfortable. She also said \"Kim said to listen because she hates repeating herself\" I never complained. If anything she made me uncomfortable. I called and complained and was told that was policy and hung up on.\n\nOn my last visit susana allowed other technicians to speak in vietnamese right in front of me while \"lil kim\" was saying fuck her baby daddy and karma is a bitch while susana was agreeing. I'm sorry but if I'm paying $75 for nails and a pedicure I don't want to hear that. I'd much rather you speak in Vietnamese. I think some of the technicians are poorly mistreated and others are allowed to get away with anything. There's a sign the says if you have a problem to let them know and NOTHING was done to fix mine.
