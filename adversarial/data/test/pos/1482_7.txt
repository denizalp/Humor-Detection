Perfect if you like your meat served with a side of 'intolerance.'  Not like hardcore... but the kind probably exhibited by your oldest uncle (this is a cross-cultural thing so I'm not singling anyone out)... you know the kind. \n\nThe first time I went, an old argentine man was yelling at me en espanol because I parked in front of the store... he probably assumed that since I was Asian, I was going to one of the adjacent Asian businesses... but I wasn't.  This dude followed me in screaming about how 'this chino' was parked out front.  The folks inside assumed I didn't understand what he was saying since I guess Asians can't understand derogatory screaming and pointing... the folks inside seemed embarrassed enough but didn't apologize or try to remedy the situation. I blew the old guy off understanding that he was from another time and place. \n\nFast forward some months, and I'm back in the store... this time I'm ignored and can't be served at the butcher counter... every Spanish speaker gets served but not the Asian dude waiting his turn.  \n\nFast forward again, and I'm back at the butcher counter... this time I'm served with a side of rude and haste... but there was a nice woman behind the counter who stepped in realizing what was happening.  She was very nice, but the same rude guy rang up my order at the register.  After getting my CC statement a few days later I realized I was overcharged by nearly double. \n\nSo you might be wondering why I keep coming back?  It's because my wife is Argentine and occasionally wants stuff from the homeland.  she'll sends me for empanadas or some cuts of beef since my office is closer to this place than hers.  I personally am a sucker for mollejas and blood sausage, so I can put up with some BS.\n\nIf you order anything pre-made or from the restaurant- the food is very over cooked, salty and prepared last week.  It's not my thing, but my wife's family enjoys the soggy mayonnaise sandwiches with no crust.  Most if not all the cuts in the Parilla are pre-cooked and re-heated before bring served on the bed of coals...\n\nMy advice, go for the raw butcher cuts and grill them up at home... they're usually ok if you're looking for the more exotic cuts not found at Albertsons or Whole Foods.  \n\n2 Stars since i'd be a hypocrite giving it one star while having been a repeat customer.
