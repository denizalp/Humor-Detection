This place was the worst. My husband made a down payment on a car, but he didn't end up buying it. He was at the dealership for 6 hours and they still didn't give him the money. We waited for about 2 weeks from when they said he would get the money and they kept ignoring his calls. Finally, he called the family lawyer and within 12 hours we had our money back. I will never buy a car from here.
