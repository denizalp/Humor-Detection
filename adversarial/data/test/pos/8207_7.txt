Mandy L., a previous reviewer of Insomnia Cookies, asks the rhetorical question regarding the longevity of a business that pretty much only sells cookies, ice cream and milk to drunk people late at night. The answer, of course, is the longest longevity that ever longeved. Even in the ashes of World War III, Insomnia Cookies will stand, because a house made of cookies is like Switzerland - no one will attack it because everyone loves it, because of its delicious chocolate.\n\nInsomnia Cookies opens sometime around noon and closes shortly after the bars do. Oddly enough, they deliver cookies too, though their delivery radius is pretty small, from what I hear. Whenever I am in Kent for lunch or dinner, I always stop by IC for a quick, cheap desert. Most of my friends are girls, and girls seem to love the S'more Cookie, which is a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips, marshmallow gooey swirl stuff, and graham chunks. And most women find more pleasure from that cookie than they ever have or will have with any man. Especially if I am that man. I, on the other hand, always get the white chocolate macadamia nut, which is to die for. The cookies are always warm and soft and gooey and melty. They have milk and ice cream. I haven't had the ice cream, so I don't know if it's good, though I'm sure it is. They often have Superman ice cream, so they get points there. Regarding milk, milk is milk so I'm sure it's fine. They don't have a lot of seating, but that's fine. Since you just got a cookie meal from a cookie restaurant, you should probably start walking some of those calories off anyhow.\n\nIf you're in town and want a pretty great cookie. Stop by Insomnia Cookies. The prices are cheap, so you can try quite a few. If you love chocolate, be sure to get the s'more cookie.
