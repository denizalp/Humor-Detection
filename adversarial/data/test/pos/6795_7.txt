This place is pretty terrible. I guess I feel bad about giving it a one-star rating so I'm giving it two.\nThey cannot cook a steak. It's unreal. And to think I ignored all the other bad reviews here on Yelp saying the same thing. The servers seem to be absolutely clueless as well. They seem like they knew they were floundering and tried to kiss ass a little bit but that doesn't make up for the expensive price tag. \nI'd rather eat steak at Sizzler. No joke.
