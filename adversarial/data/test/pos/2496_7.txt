It's Sobeys -- yes \n\nbut how it's _unique_ is that offer many Kosher foods, from dairy, deli, meats, cheeses, dry goods. \n\nWent here to get Potato Latke package and this Sobey's didn't disappoint I found 4 brands and 3 varieties from each company. Regular, home style, and low sodium. haha\n\nImagine me an asian guy standing in the grocery isle going through 12 packages!  of  Potato Lattes to determine the best one..  \n\nGreat selection for Kosher foods nuff said. :)
