Don't waste your time or money on this shady club with unethical business practices.  There is nothing that stands out about this club besides it just being one of the newer clubs on the strip.  It has LED light panels on the DJ booth and off to the sides of the DJ booth\/stage, but thats about it.  I went to see Pauly D who was an awesome DJ at the Hard Rock, so I wanted to see him at his new residency.  I'm sad that he signed with Aria because it was the first and last time I will see him at Haze.  I pre-purchased what was supposed to be VIP admission tickets for myself and my girlfriend.  The tickets say that are no longer valid if you do not enter the club before midnight.  We arrived at 10:45PM.  The lines to get into the club were a disorganized mess with staff in orange jackets huddled around each other off to the side not willing to direct or try to control any of the crowd.  There were several lines which were not clearly marked and you had to take a guess along with others in line in hopes you picked the correct line to wait in.  After waiting in line for 25 minutes, we found out the hard way along with others that were around us, that we were standing in the wrong line after reaching the front, and before we were finally directed to the correct line to get to the back and wait in again.  We patiently reached the front of the VIP line to watch the doormen let groups of people they know walk straight in, time and time again.  Hey I understand that happens once in awhile, or a group of guys in the back of the line might slip the doorman a few bucks to let them in without waiting etc., but the doormen completely ignored people in the VIP line and the only people they would let in were the ones breaking down from standing and waiting for an hour in the VIP and general admission lines and bribing the doorman the required $20 to be let it.  After an hour, a guy in line started to complain to a doorman about not being let in, so the doorman got a group of bouncers who looked at the guys prepaid ticket which says it is not valid after midnight and told him his ticket isn't good anymore so he should just leave.  WOW great customer service huh?  Well he would have been inside along with many others before midnight in the doormen were not shaking down every person in line for bribes.  So much for paying more for VIP tix vs. general admission.  Like I said I've been to many clubs in Vegas, I don't have a major problem with people slipping the doormen tips once in awhile, but the doormen should not demand it and refuse to let anyone in without a \"tip\" besides the expensive cover the club charges.  Why does a monkey that moves a rope back and forth deserve to make a few thousand dollars a night in \"tips\".  Why does HAZE management view that as acceptable behavior?  My girlfriend and I finally broke down and gave the thief posing as a doorman a $20 \"tip\" each, to let us \"cut in front of the line\" as the doorman put it, which was funny because we were standing against the rope in the front of the VIP line.  My girlfriend sweet talked a guy at the ticket booth to accept our pre-paid vouchers because they were supposed to be expired after midnight, but I saw many others in line with the same vouchers that were told they are not being accepted and they had to pay cover charge again.  Purposely making people wait in line so their pre-purchased tickets are invalid so the club can turn around and charge people cover again, plus the $20 required doorman tip in BS.  F this club, I had no problems at Marquee, XS, 1 Oak or Pure. Don't wast your night in Vegas at HAZE.  \n\nYou have been warned.  Do not go to HAZE.
