I had a terrible recent experience at Marquee that has convinced me I should never step foot in that club again. I sent the letter below to guest relations for both the Cosmopolitan and Marquee over a month ago and received no response. This club is dangerous, unethical, and unsafe. Furthermore, they seem to only care for patrons who are straight. It's 2015, this behavior is unacceptable. \n\nDear Management,\n\nI am writing to you today in regards to an incident that occurred at the Marquee nightclub, located in your hotel. On the night of 10\/17\/2015, I entered Marquee with my male cousin and a female friend. \n\nA group of female friends of mine were celebrating a bachelorette party and had purchased a table for the night. I was invited by the group to come by the table and celebrate with them.\n\nUpon entering the table area, located to the left of the DJ booth, a security guard immediately grabbed my cousin and I and pulled us out of the area forcefully. Due to his actions, I almost fell over and bumped into one of my female friends. \n\nThe security guard then told us that this was a table reserved only for women and we had to leave. After informing him that the table was paid for by my friends and they had personally invited me, he continued to push us violently away from the table. \n\nThis action was shocking and upsetting to me and the women at the table. The security guards actions were aggressive and inappropriate and he had no right to violently touch me and my cousin. The entire party found this action unprofessional, sexist, and incredibly dangerous to our safety as patrons of your establishment. \n\nI know certain nightclubs in the Las Vegas area grant free admission to women in hopes of enticing male patrons. Some staff may have seen two men near a female group and thought that they were a \"threat\" to business. However, as a gay man I also find this behavior sexist and homophobic. \n\nI would like to speak to whomever is in charge of safety and\/or guest services so we may resolve this matter. What should have been a memorable night for all those involved turned into an upsetting event. My friends and I are apprehensive about frequenting your hotel as we are concerned for our safety due to this event. \n\nWe are planning to be in Las Vegas from 11\/20-11\/22 to celebrate another bachelorette party. I hope your establishment can convince us that you welcome all patrons regardless of gender or sexual orientation. If you would like to speak to another witness of this event, I'd be happy to provide you with their contact information.
