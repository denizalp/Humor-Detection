I'm really confused here. Is it because I'm still sort of new to Charlotte? This is my first bagel from The South. It was cold. They gave me a cold bagel sandwich. I've lived all over the country, and in NYC - probably home of the original bagel - and I've never been served a cold bagel before. Is that how they do it here? \n\nCream cheese was fine. Lox was fine. Capers were fine. Cold bagel. \nTurkey was fine. Bacon was fine. Chipotle mayo was fine. Cold bagel. \n\nI paid $15 for two cold bagel sandwiches.
