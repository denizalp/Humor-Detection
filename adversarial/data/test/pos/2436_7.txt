I had a $10 off coupon from Station.  The plan was to do the feast buffet for lunch but the line was so ridiculously long on a Tuesday.  LBS didn't accept the coupon so we opted for this.  \n\nMy wife got the corn beef hash which came with eggs, hash browns and toast.  Good portion but she's definitely had better.  I got the California benedict for $10 and that was a total joke.  Small plate portion and I guess the chef doesn't know how to poach eggs either.\n\nLooked like all the regulars were getting salads.  Maybe that's what I'll go for next time although I am pretty sure I am not coming back.  I'd do IHOP over this anytime.
