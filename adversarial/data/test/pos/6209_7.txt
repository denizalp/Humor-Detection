01\/30\/2017 6:00pm update -\n\nJust received a call from the Gilbert Police alerting me that the business owner called and has told them about my review.\n\nWow! The ridiculous behavior that some will engage in rather than simply doing the right thing can simply be appalling to me. I've already informed the business they're welcome to keep their money. It's clearly more important to them than their customers satisfaction or the truth.\n\nSadly - Mr. Stark's and his staff have repeatedly chosen to be unprofessional. Instead of addressing issues Tony offers comedy and an attack of a client.  (See business owners comments). Unfortunately the business owner also chose to lie about what has happened and misrepresent his former client and commit slander in his writings below. \n\nI called the shop to speak to the owner and was told I sounded drunk and to never call or return. They don't need my business or anyone else and will do what they want when they want!\n\nAfter this horrific call, i phoned the business owner only to be billed and pushed around by him until he was informed that I record telephonic communications for later review. Although he continuously interrupted me while trying to speak, he finally tamed his control issues once the recording was disclosed. \n\nSo, gee... am I a bad customer or I this the case of someone simply not knowing what's actually going on around them?! Seems lame to me that it took me turning to social media before anyone bothered to care. I had emailed, called and spoken to Tony Starks about each of these concerns previously. \n\nReactive much to the public opinion?\n\nAlso, if you take a look at my yelp ratings you will find that I offer a variety of ratings and feedback depending on the business and interaction. In my opinion this business owner would rather tell fiction and hope folks don't actually look to see the facts. \n-------\nI once thought that this was the best of the best places to go, I have now changed my opinion for a variety of reasons, all of which I think are valid and in my opinion more than the average consumer would have tolerated before writing an updated review. \n\nI first came here at the recommendation of Yelp. I made an appointment, arrived early and waited to be seen. The barber at the time had taken on some other walk-in business and was running behind, so I asked a different fellow to cut my hair and trim my beard. Joe, the scheduled barber joked that Jay had poached me. Jay and I both clarified. \n\nIt was a good enough time joking around and getting good things done. As I left I noticed a spot on my beard that hadn't been trimmed so I went back inside...got it fixed and of course listed to Joe say had I waited for him that would have never happened. \n\nWent back and neither barber was there and nobody really knew when they'd be around, so u let someone else do my haircut and beard trim. Paid and went home. Looked closely in the mirror and had to make a lot of adjustment to the beard trim. Pretty lame for the price, but typical. \n\nI go again...this time I see Chris at 6am. He cuts my hair and trims my beard. When done he informs me that the price has gone up. It's now $3 more than what it says on the wall or Yelp...(Wtf?!) but I pay it. $35...hand him $40 and he says - \"you don't want change, right?!\"\n\nDang guys - u understand selling the tip, but there's a difference between selling it and shoving it down my throat. This was shoving it down my throat!\n\nPay it go home - everything looks good enough. Minor adjustments on the beard. \n\nSo, I still like these guys, but don't want to pay this much and keep on with having to make adjustments, so I schedule with Tony. The owner. The man. The legend. \n\nGet a call - Tony can't cut your hair. He broke his foot. We'll call you and let you know if he'll be back soon. No call. Messaged Tony on Yelp he called and we got it worked out. \n\nSee him a few times for services, and start noticing the same issues. Paying lots, but still going home and having to fix my beard because massive amounts of hair are uneven, not cut or just looks bad! So, I message him and tell him about all of this and he is very gracious offering a refund and a free service...\n\nI've been trying to schedule with the online application from the website for two days. Can't get it to work, so I do the next best thing...\"Request an appointment through Yelp\"\n\nMy appointment request on Yelp is met with thus response - \"can you call the shop and schedule?\"\n\nNow, why have this option if it's not an option and secondly if I was able to call while you're open...do you think I would have spent the last two days trying to schedule an appointment any other way guys? \n\nThe luster has worn off in my opinion following a little success. It seems quantity has overtaken the priority of quality. I'll be going elsewhere. I suggest you do the same. It is abundantly clear that they are overly confident and sufficiently satisfied with their level of customers and poor customer service.
