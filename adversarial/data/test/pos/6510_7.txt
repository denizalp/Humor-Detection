It has been awhile since stopping by TJ's, but the food and prices are as good as ever. On top of that, the restaurant has had some remodeling that has really made a positive improvement.  Service today was very good and attentive. For dinner, the family had the super cheap ($2.69)but huge cinnamon roll to start and finished with the Spanish omelet, biscuits and gravy, and the meat lovers scramble.  All were very tasty and satisfied that home cooking craving. Only complaint was the cinnamon roll was a little overcooked.  Overall though, a good time and good meal.
