Mom loves the Turkey Club.  Dad wasn't impressed with the BBQ Bacon Burger.  It was dry, dad said, 'where's the beef' and wasn't fond of the BBQ sauce.  My 440 Chicken sandwich was super dry.  Also the goat cheese was not flavorful on it.  I needed to ask for a side of dressing to swallow it on the ciabatta bread.  \n\nI've been going to Rachel's since day one, but ALWAYS get the Chicken Chopped Salad, or Turkey Club with sweet potato fries... Amazing!!  All four of us had soggy sweet potato fries.  The Turkey Club as always gets 5 stars, but as a restaurant that I love, I don't always want to order the same two items.  Earlier this year I tried a breakfast omelette that I wasn't impressed with, but thought, maybe breakfast isn't the way to go so I stuck to the same lunch items next time.  I wasn't yelping at the time.  \n\nPosting pictures of my favorite CHOPPED CHICKEN SALAD & TURKEY CLUB!!  I highly recommend.  \n\nI am rating only three stars because it's my third time ordering something new & not impressed with.  If I stuck to my original favorites I'd give a 5 star, but expect more from Rachel's. The menu is simplistic and I believe can be better than that, especially when it comes to a chicken sandwich on ciabatta and a bacon burger.  \n\nYesterday, September 27th 5pm the employees were wonderful, they get 5 stars.  I will be back to try something new again, hopefully or go back to usual the Chopped Chicken Salad.  Also checking in w\/ an entree gets you a free glass of wine.
