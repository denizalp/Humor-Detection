If you are thinking of trying a new restaurant stay far away from Osteria Dei Ganzi!!! I am proud to say I enjoy going for dinner with family, friends & having a good meal. You would probably call me a foodie & I'm ok with that. So, when a friend of mine suggested this new restaurant I was excited to try it.  \n\nWell if I knew that I would have to wait for more then 2 hours for our meal I would have thought twice. Aside from that, we had two different waitresses take different parts of our order, which wouldn't have been bad if after about 30 minutes one of them didn't come back to the table to find out what my appetizer order was. Unfortunately they both looked lost!  \n\nAfter an hour & a half of being at the restaurant without being served, the Chef, who had come out to see another table & saw we had nothing on our table but a bottle of wine. He came over to talk to us & as nice as he was to bring us mini pizzas & rice balls while we were waiting, unfortunately the rice balls were frozen in the middle!  \n\nShortly after, they proceeded to bring my appetizer, my friend's pizza & another friend's appetizer & pasta dish. By the time she finished her appetizer, her pasta was cold. By 10pm, 1 appetizer & 2 pizza's were still missing from the table. At one point they brought the pizza's out & were so confused they brought them back to the kitchen, even after I told them they were ours. The waitresses never returned to our table after they took our orders, not to apologize or ask if we needed anything.  \n\nAt this point we asked to speak to a manager that sincerely apologized & then we asked to speak to the owner. Luca Viscardi, previous owner of Toula, was extremely arrogant, although he apologized & took care of our bill, it was not sincere. They continued to offer us more wine, dessert, coffee & champagne, which we refused. This was not about getting a free meal or free drinks, but when you see a table where only half the guests are eating you should realize there is a problem. It would have been much better if the wait staff checked in on us every once in a while.  \n\nWhen going to a restaurant, you expect to be served a meal & have good service. Growing up in the restaurant business & being a member of the service industry myself, I expect to be treated with the same respect as all other customers. Other patrons, as well as the other owner had no problem at his table. Needless to say we will not be returning to this restaurant & we discourage you to go as well!
