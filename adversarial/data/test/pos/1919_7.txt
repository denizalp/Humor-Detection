like everyone else has said. this place is horrible. I think this is the place in the desert where records go to die, cus at these prices no ones ever gonna buy em again. Unless theyre suckers. I had heard that nothing had price tags on em and that it was for true record collectors so i went in knowing Id have to spend a lil xtra to get what I wanted but the prices are way out there. I picked up 3 45's for him to price me. I thought he'd look em up in a price guide or on an online auction site and ball park it. No. He looked at one and told me $100. I knew it was kinda hard to find so i was like eh maybe the other two he said he'd have to listen to em to price em but prolly $50-75. I wanted to gage his pricing so I found a LP i have at home I got for $12-15 \"Get Ready Rocksteady\" he had his son go online and look it up then tells me $250. I asked him how many were on the site. maybe he was lookin on Ebay. I was hoping there was 3 and you split the difference he told me just one. i still dont know where he got the price. When I first walked in he was very rude not nicely asking what I wanted and seemed like he didnt want any business trying to scare me off with \"these records are pretty pricy\" he told me nothing less than $15 but i didnt think he'd want $500+ for 3 45's and one LP. dont waste your time with this guy and his horrible shop
