We use Blue Sky Parking pretty frequently if we're going to be out of town for a few days. The shuttles from the parking lot to the airport are plentiful and getting back from the airport on the shuttle is a breeze. Service has always been really great when I've used them, and they offer various discounts through other companies as well as their own. They have a punch card which allows you to get one day free for every 7 days you park with them, and I've received coupons for things such as a free cookie from Paradise Bakery at the airport and a free car wash from Cobblestone when I've checked out and gotten a receipt from them. Overall it's a secure and affordable choice for parking your car when you are going out of town.
