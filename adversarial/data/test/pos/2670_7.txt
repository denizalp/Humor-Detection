This review is about my second experience with NCM and how it was significantly worse than the first. The first time was when we bought our house, and though the organization throughout the process was lacking, everything got done and we were [barely] able to move in when we were told we could.\n\nFast forward a year later and I receive an unsolicited call from Lindsay Lipsky, of NCM, telling me that it would be a great time to refinance. If you've ever owned a home you're aware that you receive calls or mail nonstop from other companies telling you it's a great time to refi as well. However, I decided to proceed with NCM since we worked with them before and it was relatively painless.\n\nBefore agreeing to start the process, we had multiple phone calls with Lindsay in order to outline the terms and conditions. We were told -- mind you, this is multiple people on my end listening to and participating in the call -- that the ONLY thing we would be paying for was the appraisal. I paid the $400+ during that phone call and I was told that I would be reimbursed for it when we closed (which Lindsay claimed that we misunderstood later on). This was reiterated multiple times, as we were not looking to refi if we would be coming out of pocket on anything. Lindsay confirmed this and the process started.\n\nA couple days later, Lindsay emailed us several documents and gave us about 45 minutes after seeing that we had opened them before she called us to see if we had questions. It seemed a little odd to literally give us less than an hour, on a Monday while at work, before trying to hurry us but that wasn't a big deal. As soon as these documents were signed and sent back, Lindsay all but disappeared. The majority of the process was handled by a woman, Lisa, whom we were told was fired halfway through our file. Unfortunately for us, she was literally the only person we could ever get a hold of with questions.\n\nLindsay had requested all the typical documents from us: pay stubs, taxes, bank accounts, etc. From that point on, she forwarded everything and took a back seat. Over the course of the next few weeks, Lisa repeatedly emailed us asking for documents that we had already sent to Lindsay. I called Lisa asking what the issue was since it seemed like every few days we were going in circles. Lisa essentially told me that Lindsay was responsible for these things and that she doesn't have \"great communication\". Great, at least I knew where the problem was.\n\nONE time ever throughout this entire process did Lindsay answer her office or cell phone when we called. Literally one time. Each and every single other time we called either line, we left a voicemail and sometimes received calls back at 9PM or 2-3 business days later. On one particular phone call, after expressing our frustration with this (no cursing or demeaning language was used) she told us that she was \"personally offended\" and that \"99% of her clients are satisfied, so we were the 1%\". Funny, a quick Google search shows plenty of complaints about her specifically. She told us that she has 40+ clients and that's way more than the average Sales Manager. Well, why did you bother calling us if you couldn't handle that big of a workload? She also had no problem throwing any of her colleagues under the bus and telling us that she would find out who didn't get something done and that person would be fired...\n\nEventually, this got to the point of us contacting Ron Goetz, the General Manager. He started off by defending NCM and their large pipeline of millions of dollars AKA we're super busy with tons of other work. After explaining to Ron our issues with Lindsay and the complete lack of communication (as well as CC'ing him on emails from that point on) he stepped up. Ron seemed to understand now and he began facilitating the process. We had constant communication with him from then on, even texting, but still got nothing from Lindsay. She did make a point, prior to closing, to tell us how glad she was that this was almost over and that she \"couldn't wait to get my commission\". Super professional.\n\nIf you've taken the time to read the longest review I've ever written, I'd like to also say that anyone can reach out to me to confirm any and all of this. I have every single email. This isn't an anger-fueled review due to having too much time on my hands. It's to help others stay away from one of the most frustrating people I've ever done business with. Again, I want to reiterate that Ron saved the deal, because I was ready to chalk it up to a giant waste of time and start over from scratch with someone else.\n\nLindsay Lipsky, you may want to try to learn from this opposed to being offended and shutting down...it's not a good look and it's clear we're not the 1% who feels this way.
