Had a previous experience that wasn't good but didn't get a chance to have the pie, so I didn't review. The latest experience was okay too but the pies were not good.\n\nService on the phone for the takeout order was solid. We arrived about 10 minutes late to pick up . It was to be ready in 15-20. We arrived in 30. Though the service was good and prompt, the order wasn't ready and the crew seemed to be hustling pies out of the oven. It was only another 5 minutes or so. No biggie.\n\nThe veggie salad was very good; however, when we opened the pie boxes, we thought the Margherita was pretty sad. Sure there are all kinds of variations on this fare that has evolved from peasant food, but we took a pic so you can judge for yourself. It tasted rather \"okay.\" The roasted mushroom pie tasted really salty to me, which might have been because it was a bit overloaded with pancetta... probably cheap pancetta. That might have been nice for many folks to get extra swine, but we wanted a mushroom-based pie, not a pancetta pizza.
