We were looking for a new Chinese restaurant to try on a random weeknight.  The reviews looked surprisingly good for a Chinese restaurant in Boulder City, so we decided to give it a shot.\n\nThere were 3 other tables with diners when we arrived and a couple take out customers came in while we were there.  The service was quick, the food hot, and the restaurant clean.  I would not say the food was anything special though.  The soups and entr√©es were a little bland, but tasted fresh.  This is definitely 'Americanized' Chinese, but the price was right.
