This would be really great pizza, if my idea of a great pizza consisted of a ludicrously large portion of the kind of pizza one would find at a high school cafeteria. Alas, that isn't my idea of a good pizza, and so King Slice does not rate highly on my list. \n\nThe deluxe slice I ordered was really bland. The cheese didn't taste very fresh and was barely melted (I prefer the cheese on my pizza to have the kind of golden color that comes from a little extra time in the oven). I liked the crispy crust, but the toppings weren't integrated with\/anchored to the crust -- it was sort of like eating a pizza made on one of those Boboli pizza shells from the supermarket, where the toppings just slide right off. The slice was gigantic, but it just wasn't very good. Because the slice is so large, it's served on two plates; however, their use of flimsy paper plates just makes things super messy. \n\nOn the other hand, the Greek salad was impressive for a pizza joint: the lettuce was fresh, crisp, and hand-torn; the tomatoes were ripe; the feta was semi-soft and nicely briney. \n\nSorry, King Slice - this princess is off to find pizza in another kingdom.
