I accidentally spilled my first beer and was excessively ridiculed and embarrassed by this disrespectful bartender, Jennifer. She also charged me full price for the spilled beer (which probably costs the bar pennies); never seen that before. Accidents happen. No damage was done. Be professional. Never going back.
