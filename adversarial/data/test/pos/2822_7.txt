I do not get the concept on this place. Service is not the key, I fuel my two car every week and  pay at the pump most of the time but  if I need to fuel and pay cash this a nightmare!!!   The cashier is the Barista , If you happened to get in line with three guys in front of you , better start praying because it might take 8 minutes before you can pay for Gas!!!!  you are stuck between lattes and cupcakes,  in my opinion the need two cashiers at all time . Do not  kill customer service for trying to be fancy????????
