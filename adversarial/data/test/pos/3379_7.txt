I ordered the \"High Maintenance\" burrito with soy paper fro the wrap.  Again, deliciousness....how else to describe the text, crunchy, and fresh fish! My burrito was even more extraordinary because I added salmon to it!!\n\nThe ambience is casual, clean, and the employees are inviting.  \nThis is the first and best sushi burrito and poke bowl place in town.\nIts a must come, if you want a change in pace for the normal day to day food choices!!!
