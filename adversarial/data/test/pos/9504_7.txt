I like the idea: a two-story flexible open-plan space for businesses to pop up as needed. I'm just not really sure the concept works here. The only business that had more than a couple of customers was the View Wine Bar, in the middle of an otherwise busy weekend afternoon where other businesses where packed and a farmer's market filled the plaza with foot traffic.\n\nThis area has a variety of complementary but non-competing businesses clustered together: a braiding\/blow-dry bar and a tanning salon, a portrait studio and an art shop, a candy store and kid's clothing shop, and a surprisingly stunning d√©cor store. Several of them seemed to be hurting for business though, with a single bored-looking employee and no customers. \n\nProperty management seems to be making an effort to direct traffic this way: there are standing easels in the outdoor plaza pointing to the entrances in the area, there is a dedicated elevator in the parking garage, and extensive wall-art encouraging visitors to stop in and explore. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working.
