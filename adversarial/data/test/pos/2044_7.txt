I have heard stories and dreamed about this day.\n\nI have finally tired In-N-Out Burger @ Las vegas \n\nThis was like dream come true.\n\nLet me say we went on a good time where that outside temperature was 98 degrees and this restaurant had a\/c and room to dine inside!\n\nWe ordered 1 cheeseburger and 1 double with fries and drinks.\n\nFood\nPro: This place rocks. Burgers were well cooked. with fresh lettuces and tomatoes.\nCon: I expect more on the fries. Sort of disappointed.\n\nI live in the south and always eating McDonald and Burger king and coming to Vegas able to hit the IN-N-OUT was one of my bucket-list.\n\nOverall:\nIt was a dream come true. I finally made it. I have joined the In-N-Out club. I feel proud :)
