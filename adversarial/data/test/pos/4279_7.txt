The past few days,i have had major discomfort in the jaw area in my mouth. After doing an\ninternet search for dentists in las vegas,I decided on making an appointment with Dr. Amy\nTongsiri. Reasons for selecting Dr. Tongsiri is that  what I call a ma and pa small business.\nThat is One doctor small office facility. I am never impressed with a massive dental practice with multiple dentists and a large building as its location. I expect competence and hopefully affordability.plus passion for their responsibilities as a dentist. After meeting Dr Tongsiri,I am confident that she has passion and competence in her skills. The affordability determination will have to wait till my next visit late next week since i have to take antibiotics for a week before determining this. If your looking for a dentist that has passion,competence,Dr. Tongsiri will meet your needs. According to the Silver State Smiles web site Dr, Tonsiri is part of the faculty at UNLV School of Dental Medicine.
