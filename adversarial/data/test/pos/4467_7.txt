Looking for authentic Thai food in Las Vegas? Look no further than West Sahara at Chuchote Thai Bistro and Desserts! Service was excellent and very attentive.\n\nThe family met here today to enjoy some lunch and and hour later and 12 menu items in our bellies we all left STUFFED!\n\nWhen we eat Thai style food we like to share each others meal and sample everything. They served our waters in small metal cups true Thai style. Today we started with a couple appetizers: chicken wings 4\/5 which comes with a bowl of some sweet and sour sauce with hot sauce in the middle, river fish cakes 5\/5 served with sweet and sour sauce topped with cucumbers and peanuts, presented on a skewer with a cherry tomato, cucumbers and fish cake halves, delicious! Mum also ordered a thai coffee which came with a ball of shaved ice atop 5\/5.\n\nIn addition to the appetizers we ordered the pad si ew beef 3\/5 which was just ok, the beef boat noodle soup 3\/5 noodles were good but the beef was just ok, the pad thai with fried tofu 5\/5, spicy and delicious, cashew nut with chicken very spicy 5\/5 served with a bowl of rice, addicting, I ate every last piece! We also had the tom yum soup seafood style with mussels, squid, shrimp and mushrooms 4\/5 very good broth flavor. \n\nFor dessert there was a Yelp check-in offer for a free shaved ice, the pleasant servers combined our tables Yelp check-in offers and made it a large. We also saw on the board when entering they offered a special custard bread which was a sweet bread stuffed with homemade pandan flavored custard and we also got one thai coffee flavored 4\/5. We also tried the roti which was amaze balls 5\/5. Lastly we had another shaved ice, the mango flavor with fresh chopped mango surrounding the tower of shaved ice 4\/5.\n\nAll in all a great family meal, we will be back again!
