I'd been to Postinos a couple times, but once I took my parents there, it's the only place they ever want to go! As big wine folks, they know that after the hour and a half drive from Tucson, they just want to relax and have a glass of wine and some bruschetta.\n\nWhile there isn't a HUGE menu to select from, the bruschetta, soups, salads and paninis are perfectly portioned, amazingly tasty and refreshing, no matter what time of year. Their unique selection of bruschetta includes apple and brie with fig spread, proscuitto with figs and mascarpone and salami with pesto (plus a few others). And their wine list makes up for it. They have an extensive selection that they change out regularly, and you can buy a bottle on your way out to enjoy at home.  My favorite that I discovered at Postinos is the Hey Mambo.\n\nTucked away in a charming neighborhood in Phoenix, Postinos is a great place to enjoy some wine and bruschetta. They usually do have the garage door open, so you get the fresh outdoors no matter where you sit. When the weather is perfect out, the outdoor seating is great too.\n\nAlthough 90% of the time you have to valet park due to limited parking, it is only $3 and very convenient. It is probably one of the only places I don't mind valet parking at in Phoenix.
