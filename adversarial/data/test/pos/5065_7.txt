This is our go-to movie theater.\nAlways clean and the service is always friendly. \n\nOur most recent visit was delightful because we sat in the D-box seating and it was a real adventure. Similar to Captain EO! Just try it yourself. PS D-box seats DO NOT RECLINE. \n\nI would def say this is the best Galaxy theater we have been to. Last time we were at the other local one it was super dirty and all the floors were sticky! \n\nMY first visit the snack bar guy verified that their popcorn is vegan without the butter on it. Now that's customer service! He actually went and got the flavoring ingredients list and showed me himself. It being GMO and artificial now that's a whole other ball of wax I won't talk about :)\n\nHop online, pick out your movie and pay online, go to a kiosk upon entering and slide your card you used. Out pops the tickets and enjoy your show. \n\nIt's a casino so you can valet if you like. There is also exterior theater doors in the self park area if you don't want to walk through the casino.
