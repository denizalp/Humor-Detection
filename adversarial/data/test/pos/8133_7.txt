As a noodle lover, I'm so glad Ohjah Noodle House opened nearby! \n\nShoyu ramen was great, similar to Ramen Sora in my opinion. The house fried rice was delicious - flavorful with pork and imitation crab. My husband had the House Oxtail ramen and while the noodles and broth were good, he said the oxtail was just okay. It didn't have a lot of meat and lacked the \"cooked all day, fall off the bones\" texture that oxtail lovers enjoy. Shrimp skewers were a 7 out of 10, okay but not worth ordering again.\n\nService was friendly and quick. The restaurant is spacious, open, clean and inviting. Other ramen places tend to be small and cramped, so this was a nice change! \n\nWill definitely be adding this place to the rotation!
