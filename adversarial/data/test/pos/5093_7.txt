Comwave is a nightmare.\n\nI signed up and was told the install would happen in 10 days, between 8 and 5, and that they would provide me with a narrower time frame when it was closer to the date. They didn't. I waited around for 9 hours for the tech they contracted who never showed up. Called Comwave at 5 to cancel my service, and had to FIGHT for the service representative on the phone to let me cancel. I have never repeated myself more in my life. After that, I got nothing but incredibly shocking rudeness. What kind of business practices that kind of treatment?\nIn between those 10 days, I had several other bad customer service experiences over the phone because of various things they'd mishandled. It's clear that their reps aren't trained very well.\nThankfully, I found a better service provider (better meaning it was the same price without a monthly download limit, and they actually showed up!). Don't go with Comwave. If a \"discount service provider\" can afford commercials, avoid them. Avoid avoid avoid. So many other things were treated with incompetence.
