Food: OK at best\nService: HORRIBLE\nAmbiance: NOT great\n\nI got the chicken pistachio pesto and house cut fries. Fries were good. Chicken was nicely cooked. Nothing special though.\nMy sister got the caramel pancake. It was the size of my face and pretty good, but nothing special.\nMy brother got the fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit and he wasn't impressed.\n\nThe service was horrible. I had to flag someone different down all night for water refills. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our check. Every time we got someone to refill\/get our check\/etc, our waitress came around RIGHT AFTER, but never any other time.\n\nThe live band was so loud, we had to scream most the time. It is a nice idea, but maybe turn the volume down several notches. \n\nThank goodness for Reba. She wasn't our waitress, but was helpful when we needed.
