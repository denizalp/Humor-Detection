The Village Green restaurant was great. I was having a tough time figuring out what to order and could not decide. Then, my good buddy George recommended the Prime Rib Sandwich and I could not be more impressed by the choice. I was in love at first sight when I saw this sexy sandwich. I wanted to scream at the top of lungs and express my love for this prime rib. Waitress was great and pin ball machine kept the kids in check. \n\nP.S. The cheese curds gave me a semi.
