Usually I jump around from different nail salons because I could never find anyone that I did what I considered to be a good enough job. I had given up and just figured that I was asking for too much and would never find the person I was looking for. That all changed when I found Elaine.  Looking for a new salon on yelp I came across Elaine. I read the good reviews and figured I would give her a try. Well I am certainly happy I did. Elaine is truly a protectionist. She does a great job every time. I have definitely found a nail salon and would never consider going to anyone else but Elaine.  Her place is very clean and I love the fact that she gives you your own nail bag to keep and use when you come in.  I don't know what I did before finding Elaine.  I would recommend her to anyone who is as picky about their nails as I am.
