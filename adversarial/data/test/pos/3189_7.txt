I was nervous about renting here after reading the other reviews but luckily all turned out OK!  They're definitely rough around the edges, but it was worth it for the ridiculously low price. \n\nPick up from the Pearson parking lot was pretty quick - about 10 minutes - in an unmarked van.  \n\nMy biggest complaint was how long it took to check out the car.  Lots of confusing paperwork.  The car itself was pretty good (~30K km).\n\nAfter seeing other reviewers complain about damage fees, I did a close walk-around with the person, and made them check me in when I got returned the car.  No extra charges -- whew! \n\nTip: if you're going into the US, there's an extra fee ($10\/day) and your mileage is capped (200 km\/day, $0.20\/km thereafter).  Negotiate an extra kilometres package at a lower rate if you know about how far you'll be driving. \n\nNote that they'll charge extra for liability insurance (~$9\/day) if you don't have proof of your own.\n\nAll in all, this place seems just fine if you're willing to put up with a little extra hassle and \"good enough\" service to save some money (like I always am!).
