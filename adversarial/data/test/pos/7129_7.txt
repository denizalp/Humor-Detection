I have been there 3 times only once I had freshly cooked ribs the other 2 times was horrible just like tv dinner heated in a microwave . The food is overrated and definitely  very over priced for what you get. They try to hit you over $10 minimum no matter how small you want your portion to be.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all as you never know what to expect after you pay and they do not believe in refund if you are not happy with your food.
