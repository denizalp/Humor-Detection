On my most recent trip to Vegas, it was totally planned for me to visit both locations at Border Grill.  I did the Border Brunch at Mandalay Bay (which you can read here -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1J9rf0S) so with my other visit to the Forum Shops location, I decided to try their famous Chile Relleno Burger which was on Eater Vegas' list of Top 10 Burgers to try.\n\nChile Relleno Burger -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1J9Cedu\nGround short rib and brisket, panela cheese relleno, pickled chiles, tomato jam aioli, arugula\nThis was a very solid burger!  And different as well.  Using a Chile Relleno for a topping was a stroke of genius since it added a spicy, crunchy, gooey-cheese enhancement to the well-cooked burger.  I would recommend giving this burger a try.  And it came with fries as a bonus.\n\nAs for the location, it's located at the entrance of the Forum Shops where the escalators are in the the former P.J. Clarke's space.  The layout is essentially the same with the bar in the back of the restaurant and patio out in front which is great for people watching.\n\nIn terms of which Border Grill I think is better, I'd say the edge goes to the Mandalay Bay since it has that almost beachfront feel to it with their patio being outside near the Mandalay Bay Pool.  Nevertheless, both locations are worth visiting and have almost identical menus including their famous Border Brunch.
