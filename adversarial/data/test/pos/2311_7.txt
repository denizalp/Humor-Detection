What can I say about Cinnabon?  The perfect cinnamon bun, with cinnamon jelly stuff that perfectly encapsulates the cinnamon flavour without being too sweet or too synthetic-tasting.  The same applies to the frosting.  The inside of the bun is always perfectly soft and gooey, even when you heat it up after freezing.  And nobody else can come close.\n\nWhy do you have to be so far away from me, Cinnabon?  Why Cinnabon, why Cinnabon, why?  Do you understand life?  You're tearing me apart!\n\nAt least you're open until 10 PM and you have a seating area, which, I kid you not, I didn't notice until my tenth visit xD.  Alas I must also point out that you have to pay a TTC fare to access Cinnabon, as they are inside the Eglinton subway station.\n\nThat's all I have to say - Cinnabon is just amazing!
