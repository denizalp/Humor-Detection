Ive only been twice , but i loved it.. its like the white trash version of coyote ugly. Gotta love all the bras scattered and hung behind the bar. Dont order water or the bartenders will scream at you and call you a P****\nIf i were a guy suprisingly, i might not like it as much, they call out the guys alot about buying girls drinks... kinda bs. and i do think the cocktails are overpriced so order beer....hmmm come to think of it... maybe i was just drunk and this place sucks....
