Rating: 3.5\/5.\n\nThe fresh $12.99 crab roll came with a small side of crisp cucumbers. The crab meat mixed with mayonnaise tasted slightly bland. \nMoreover, the size portion was too small to be fulfilling. \n\nThe waiter made a mistake on the order of a crab roll. Initially, he brought a lobster roll. To be honest, I told him so. \nThe fresh-looking lobster meat was paired with iceberg lettuce. Nevertheless, the size portion of the lobster meat was small. \nSo, the ~ $17 lobster roll went back to the kitchen. And the ordered crab roll arrived afterwards.\n\nThe clean decor was relaxing and homey. \nThe bathroom was clean with no changing table.\nTheir free wifi for customers wasn't working.\n\nYou can park easily on the street for free up to two hours from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m..\n\nThe food was fresh. But I would hesitate to come back here because of the size portion.
