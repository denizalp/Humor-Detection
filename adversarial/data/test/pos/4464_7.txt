Bob Evans is a decent breakfast place. Whatever you order, it will be done right and you won't mind the prices. The service is okay but there's one thing that bugs me about Bob Evans - any Bob Evans restaurant:\n\nThey really want you to hurry up and get out so they can turn the table. You can tell from the minute you walk in. If there's a wait, ( there always is on saturday or sunday) in the back of your mind you know some people are in line watching you eat, hoping you'll hurry up so they can get your table. The waitress wants you to order your breakfast as soon as you sit down but she'll be patient and wait the 30 seconds it takes for her to get your coffee. Any longer and you'll get the look. Your food arrives a couple of minutes later. You eat for a few minutes and she's back. Is everything okay? More coffee? Here's your bill. Take it up front. You wolf down your eggs and find yourself doing the unthinkable, you tell your partner, \"C'mon, honey, finish your coffee so we can get the hell out of here.\" She slows down on purpose and now your heart rate is up and you can't wait to get out. There's a line at the checkout. C'mon, let's go, people. The lady waiting for a table, just off the highway with her six kids is looking at you. If she weren't so polite, she'd call you something rude. You're the problem. You're the reason she can't have breakfast. You hang your head in shame. You want to apologize. You pay. Was everything all right? Yeah, sure. You breathe hard a few times and you're back out into the world. It's over. Breakfast is over. It's okay. It's gonna be okay.\n\nThe prices are good and the biscuits are great with honey. Maybe it's a lot more fun on a blizzardy tuesday at 10:00 am in February. Maybe.
