Located in Treasure Island, and is opened 24 hours a day, is this American Diner Theme Eatery place. It's convenient diner food, which is all that is remarkable about this facility. \n\nThe service could be better, it was slow during my visit. The dining hall is dead on 0630 on a Tuesday morning, and it took us at least 15 minutes to get our place mats, additional flatware, and water? And then another 15 minutes to get our meals? Some how I think the staff needs caffeine injections. \n\nFood is ok, it's swimming with the heavy use of butter on everything. It's a diner place after all - don't expect anything healthy from here. Just fill you up and then rush to a tradeshow.
