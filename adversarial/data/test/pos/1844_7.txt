Hadn't been to a Fuddruckers in years!  \n\nMy wife signed up for their e-club, and they sent us a coupon for a free kids meal.  We were going to be down in the area, so we decided to come here for lunch.\n\nI went with a Large Burger, cooked medium, with American cheese and made it a combo (fries and drink).  My wife went with a Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and we got the kids burger meal.  You order and pay at the counter, they hand you a buzzer, you find your own seat\/booth and then pick up your food at the counter once the buzzer goes off.  Less than 10 minutes total between ordering and receiving our food.  Here is how everything was...............\n\nCheeseburger w\/American Cheese-  This thing looked fantastic!  They present it to you open faced so you can go to their topping bar (That's the big thing about Fuddruckers...they present your burger plain, and then you go over to the condiment\/sauce bar and create your own masterpiece.  They have lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, relish etc.) and pile on whatever you want.  I am a pretty simple man when it comes to burgers, so I just added some onion and I was good to go.  The burger was cooked a tad above what I ordered (medium), but it was still great!  This thing was incredibly juicy and full of flavor.  Cooked on a flattop grill, the patties had nice crunchy marks on both sides of each patty.  The American cheese was melted perfectly, and the bun was incredibly delicious, too! My combo came with their steak fries.  These were just ok.  Could have been way crispier, and were just kind of plain.  I did get some of their jalapeno cheese sauce to try and \"jazz\" them up a bit.  Even then,  I didn't really like them and wished I had ordered onion rings instead.  Screw the fries though.....this meal was all about the burger.  If this was my last burger I ever had, I would die a happy man.  This burger was easily 5 stars, and one of the best burgers I have had in Phoenix!  I really enjoyed it! \n\nMy wife enjoyed her chicken sandwich and gave me a piece of it.  It was a huge chicken breast, perfectly fried and nice and crispy.  I would definitely eat this again if I wasn't in the mood for a burger (hard to do though since the burger I had was so great...couldn't see myself NOT ordering a burger from here in the future!).  Kids enjoyed their cheeseburger and fries, and their meal came with a cookie.  Had a bite of the cookie and it was just meh.  \n\nService was friendly from the cashier and the lady at the counter who handed me my food.  Place was pretty clean, and there is plenty of seating.  I could definitely see myself coming back here soon.  That burger was fantastic!
