I've decided to go with 'middle' 3 stars for two reasons:\n\n1) The steak pizza is probably the best I've had, especially if you have late night munchies it is absolutely mouth-watering.\n\n2) I know multiple people and have various stories about gunshots, and other shady things that occur here so that kind of knocks down the pizza a bit if you're fearing for your life.\n\nIs it worth it? Go in the daylight or if you're real brave, at night with pepper spray, a posse of friends, & running shoes.
