There is no way to know what is in your ice cream. \nDO NOT GO IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES. \nIRRESPONSIBLE food selling. \nI asked if the coconut cream had wheat in it. The lady went back to ask, the person in back did not know. She asked another girl who said it just had coconut, something and sugar gems. I had no idea wtf a sugar gem was. I had specifically told the employee I could not have wheat. I had a bute of taster and there was a piece of cookie - pretty sure made with wheat. \nDO NOT GO IF YOU ARE CELIAC. \nThey are irresponsible! Their own employees have no way to find out what is in their ice cream.
