I've always wanted to try the Vig and never had a chance. Saturday afternoon we were in the area so we decided to try it. \n\nWe walked in for lunch and I guess for lunch it's a pick your own table no hostess. Very modern looking. Very interesting inside just can't describe besides very modern. The inside is pretty dark where we sat. They had modern music playing. Pretty upbeat but not rocky. \n\nAnyways, I ordered the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was interesting with grilled red onions, tomatoes, cheese, and greens. It looked really good but tasted ok. Let me put it this way. Not a lot of taste. I really loved the sweet potato fries. Overall, I thought it was an okay meal. \n\nMy wife ordered the Turkey sandwich which had tons of turkey with coleslaw and cranberry on a pretzel roll. Nice combination. I stole a quick bite and it was really good.  \n\nThe service was really good. We were greeted quickly at our table. Drinks were at our table quickly and refills regularly. They even boxed my wife's leftovers. \n\nSo overall, we had a really good time. Great relaxing atmosphere, good food, and good service. What else could you ask for. We enjoyed it. I hope you do too.
