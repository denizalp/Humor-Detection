I am a new patient who was referred to this location by a friend. I have been trying to book an appointment for almost a month now. I signed up via their online form and never received a response... so now 3 weeks later I call in to speak with them directly, and get an answering service who offered to fax my information to the scheduling office... the same place who never called me the first time.\n\nThis is absolutely unacceptable and I will try my luck elsewhere instead of waiting for my health condition to worsen. I will not try this location again until whoever is managing their scheduling department has to find another job. If I could give this place zero stars I would.
