Oh god, I just.... I just love you, Lupie's.  There, I said it.  Now declare your reciprocated love for me by serving me delicious chili mac, burgers (meat & veggie alike), bbq plates, BEST mac n' cheese and veggies.  Confirm this love even further through your peach kuchen and banana pudding and I'm yours forever.  Serenade me with Parliament Funkadelic and the Smiths.  Thanks for making it okay to be lazy by driving to you instead of walking because I know I won't make it home when I'm done even though I live close by.
