I stayed @ the Wynn in December when Encore first opened, therefore I took a look that visit. \n\nMy recent visit, I gambled a bit @ Encore and was surprisingly successful.  \n\nParking is fairly easy @ this casino.  You don't have to walk a mile to the parking lot like that horrible casino the Riviera...   Parking is also convenient @ Wynn.\n\nEncore doesn't have a sports book which isn't a good thing...\n\nI put a hundred into a video poker machine and ordered a coffee.   It wasn't comped, I had to pay $4 which is Neiman Marcus prices.  This was the first time I played video poker @ a casino bar which didn't provide me with a free drink.  That's bullshit!  Well, @ least I got 4 aces and doubled my money...\n\nBeautiful casino and I will stay there someday soon...
