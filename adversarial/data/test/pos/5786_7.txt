I was excited to try this place because I'm always looking for good BBQ and it was on The Food Network. Sadly, I was disappointed. The brisket was very thin and didn't have much flavor, the ribs were okay (not great), the cornbread was too sweet (tasted like cake not cornbread) and the Mac & cheese was yummy. So only one thing was actually good. While we were eating I was thinking \"well at least the Mac & Cheese is good...it wasn't a total waste\" but then...my upset stomach began. My stomach was messed up all day and into the evening. My friend had the same reaction. I'm so disappointed. \n\nIf you do decide to go here, I wouldn't go in the summer unless you plan to take the food home because the only seating is outside on picnic tables. Luckily it wasn't too hot the day we went, but it still wasn't comfortable.
