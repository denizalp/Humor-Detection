Ay yi yi!  I hate leaving bad reviews but sadly, this one is deserved.  I'm a bridesmaid in a friend's upcoming wedding and the bride decided to order the bridesmaids dresses from here.  Everything was fine and good...until the bridesmaids dresses failed to arrive by the promised date.  The poor bride and maid of honor made repeated frantic calls to see if the store could put a rush on the dresses or at the very least, provide a new estimated arrival date.  The staff here was very rude and unprofessional -- they never once apologized for the delayed dresses, got flustered and angry on the phone, and refused to pay any extra amount to have the dresses rushed so they would actually arrive on time.  Very bad customer service!  In the end, the dresses arrived a mere week before the wedding, the bride had to pay out of pocket to overnight them to out-of-town bridesmaids, and we all had to pay extra to have them rush tailored.  \n\nIf you're a bride, save yourself some unnecessary stress and find another place to look for your wedding accessories!  Bad bad BAD!
