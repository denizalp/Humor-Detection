***Like many restaurants in Las Vegas, Border Grill is a multiple-location restaurant; while it might not be the most original Vegas dining experience, the kitchen does a good job of churning out quality food with great consistency not found at many big brands on The Strip***\n\nLas Vegas, especially The Strip, is filled with second location restaurants from big name chefs. Border Grill in Mandalay Bay is one of them. Several of these restaurants are disappointing especially due to how it feels like quite a few Vegas kitchens are phoning it in because they are going to get a big customer base regardless of the quality. Border Grill is not that way though.\n\nBorder Grill features upscale Mexican cuisine, and while it may not elevate Mexican cuisine to justify the high price point, food is prepared with consistency here. My lunch started with a complimentary basket of hearty and crunchy tortilla chips. The chips came with a trio of sauces with two of them being surprisingly spicy for somewhat mainstream Mexican cuisine.\n\nFor my entrée, I had their chile relleno, which I enjoyed quite a bit. The roasted poblano was filled with a really good, thick and stretchy Mexican cheese. The poblano was nicely cooked and flavorful. The outside crispy crust was good and not too greasy. The chile relleno came with sides of two kinds of rice and really good pureed black beans topped with Mexican cheese.\n\nFor dessert, I had their salted chocolate chip cookies with condensed milk ice cream. Of all the restaurants I have ever been to, this was probably the best bang-for-the-buck dessert I have ever had. At $6, the dessert included not 1, not 2 but 5 large salted chocolate chip cookies. And the cookies were delicious. They were fresh out of the oven and were nicely crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with warm and gooey chocolate chips (perfect chocolate flavor).\n\nThe cookies were accompanied by two generous scoops of condensed milk ice cream. The ice cream was very creamy and not icy, and it delivered on its name by really getting across the condensed milk flavor with every spoonful.\n\nService was friendly and quick.\n\nTheir lunch prices vary. Some items like the chile relleno are priced about right given that it is Vegas, but some of their more entrée-dishes are in the high-$20s range and are probably not worth the high price tag.\n\nIn terms of the décor, Border Grill is okay. It is far away from the casino (near the convention center at Mandalay Bay) so you do not get the disturbance of cigarette smoke like you do at several other casino restaurants. Border Grill offers both indoor dining and an outdoor (and covered) patio.\n\nBorder Grill is a good spot for a satisfying and slightly upscale lunch. I have been to the Border Grill in Los Angeles, and it is about on par with this location. While Border Grill is known for serving upscale Mexican cuisine, several would say that Border Grill does not warrant their high prices. I would agree on that point to a certain extent. Rick Bayless' Chicago-based restaurants (especially Topolobampo) truly elevates Mexican cuisine by integrating hard-to-find Mexican ingredients and churning out moles of incredible complexity. Border Grill does not come close to that. But judging Border Grill on just what it really is, which is an upscale restaurant with Mexican flavors, it is a worthwhile lunch spot in Las Vegas--especially if you find yourself at Mandalay Bay, which is quite far from other notable Vegas casinos.\n\nI noticed that Mandalay Bay no longer offers complimentary self parking. I imagine it is because they struggle to secure parking for their hotel guests during busy times. It is kind of a nuisance given how almost every hotel on The Strip offers complimentary self parking.
