Came here after the Warriors final game. Warning!!! This place is a bit scary. You have to ring a door bell to get buzzed in. A group of us came in and a bartender started to stare us down. We were told that there was a designated area for us to order drinks even though we have been here before. After settling in we were asked by the bartender to hush down and there is no roaring  because we were being too loud playing foos ball, again there was only 4 people in the establishment. I will not surprised if this place will last another several months. There is 2 manikin stripper spinning in lingerie, a bit creepy, not to mention every other photo on the wall is some scantly clad girl on the wall. \nThis place has potential but management will run it to the ground. We tried to quickly redeem our points, but he gave us attitude all the way through to redeem them. It was pulling teeth and nails. Worst experience ever!
