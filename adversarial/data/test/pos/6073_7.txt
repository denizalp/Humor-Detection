Hakkasan is a really fun place but there are a few downfalls. The music is great. They have cool screens and stuff but those just show the same thing over and over and over, which I found really boring. \nFirst downfall was the exit. When you are ready to leave, this place is actually pretty scary. I feel like there are only enough exit signs to be legally acceptable. It was very confusing and very cramped. I didn't drink, but I can't imagine being drunk and trying to navigate that. It was scary for me even! \nWe got there early on one of the guest lists and the pre-DJ music really was not making it fun for us. We went right down in the middle of the club by the DJ booth and I was shorter than longer that we were crowded out. Another downfall, women are encouraged to just go up to guys who have bottle service just to get free drinks. I guess that makes it appealing to men to go there, but I just didn't really like that. \nSome cool things: there is confetti dropped multiple time throughout the evening. There was 'undercover' security everywhere! They did not look obvious but after people watching for a little bit, you could totally tell they were security. You do not need to pay to get in unless you are going there for a special DJ or something. On any old regular night, try to take a walk through MGM Grand or some of the other hotels owned by MGM and find a promoter! Give them your real name and phone number and details about the group of people you are with and they should get you on the guest list and help you out with plans for the rest of the night. \nIf you are in Vegas and have the opportunity to get into this club at no cost, I would check it out. I had a good time after the actual DJ came on.
