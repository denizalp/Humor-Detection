I am surprised, Toronto. What do you have against this covered sky bridge connecting my fave stores? It's cold here in the winter, rains here sometimes, and August is just too darn hot. I'm digressing... you understand weather. \n\nThis climate controlled beauty connects the Eaton Centre and The Bay allowing you to keep your dignity intact in the face of the ever-changing Toronto temperatures. Crap. I'm talking about weather again. \n\nIt's how I get from H&M to Top Shop, and it's how you do, too. \n\nPost Script: Pepper's credit card is maxed.
