Wow Wow can't even explain why I paid $13 + tax for nothing here. \n\nMy car was soapy, dirty and dripping wet after coming out and waiting for a dozen cars in front of me. I would have never noticed if my side mirrors weren't covered in soap. Upon stepping out and inspecting my windshield wipers and parts of my car were also covered in soap and still had dirt on it. On top of all that...dripping wet. \n\nWent in to complain and lo and behold the girl that was in front of me driving a white honda was also complaining.  On her white car you can see the dirt so clearly. \n\nThe guy cashier was apologetic but the white woman who seemed to be the owner just kept on having a convo with the cashier about something else while I was speaking. \n\nLoudly just saying no refund no refund... I tried to talk to her logically but she wouldn't even listen. The guy offered another rinse which would leave my car the same way. \n\nThe girl and I took it because the owner was adamant of not doing anything else. Didn't even seem that she wanted to offer the re rinse. \n\nThis is not the Esso brand that I am loyal to. \n\nWent through again and they only did water so it was still dirty just no soap and dripping wet when I left. \n\nNot the cashiers fault but the franchise owner needs to step up because it wasn't a one off...ppl just don't see it til they leave. \n\nBS
