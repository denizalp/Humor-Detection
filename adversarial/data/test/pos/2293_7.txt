Tried coming here once. No parking!  They have like 3 parking spots. Its hot as hell outside no one wants to drive around looking for a place to park on a regular Wednesday night.  Maybe if you can walk or ride a bike or a horse it may be worth trying.  Get a  building with more than 3 parking spots and this place could be legit.
