I called to see if this place is \"Japanese\" owned and asked TWICE. The girl responded YES TWICE. Well, she LIED! I was pretty pissed and after we left, I gave a $3 tip (dollar per person).\nI don't appreciate when people lie as it was Korean owned and they don't have the knowledge to cook Japanese food. Of course, most people don't know the difference between Japanese and Korean (except for Asians). And on top of that you can tell by the atmosphere that it's not Japanese....Never again.......
