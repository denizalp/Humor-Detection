Yeah, four stars for this little lounge type restaurant in Caesars.\n\nI liked the feel of the small place. I loved their location close to the Poker Room and Sports Book at Caesars. \n\nMost of all I found my favorite pre-poker-tournament meal at Munch Bar. \n\nTheir Sirloin Steak Salad is freakin awesome. The ingredients combine perfectly and my hats off to the cook who prepared the sirloin that topped the salad to a perfect medium rare and the dressing just set the entire dish off perfectly.\n\nI loved it.
