If I could give no stars, I would.\n\nMy mother, sister, daughter, and I walked in to get nails and pedicures done. But were turned away for not having an appointment. Which had they been busy, would have been understood. But the man and lady in there were just sitting around watch tv and eating. Like really?? \n Sorry to want to give you money and interrupt your breakfast. Bye Felicia.\n\n\nEdited to add pictures of the owners response.
