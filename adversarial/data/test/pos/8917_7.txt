Seven Inches Tacos Y Mariscos is the place I used to run in Toronto, but it went out of business because it was numerically inaccurate, so I'm glad that a similar (but similarly fake) business has popped up in its wake. Owned by Marisco Hargitay, this taco place is in the flowery hipstery awesome Kensington Market, and it could not be any more white if it tried... and it has tried... and found it impossible. \n\nI got a very very angry private message because I said this place is not Hispanic. I mean, it almost is in a fusion, Americanized, Canadianized, whateverized way. Whether an actual Hispanic person owns it is not the point. People who come here for traditional Mexican food will balk. If they know what it is. Still, if you come here for San Diego style Mexican, or just something tasting good, then maybe it's ok.\n\nWhat to get: Gubernador (shrimp taco), Fish Taco, Horchata.\nWhat else: Get a beard and some tats, or you won't fit in.\n\nI'd like to give it a 5 based on food alone because the Gubernador, while being nowhere near as good as German Marisco's Truck in San Diego, is really quite yummy. The fish taco is good too, and the Horchata is excellent.\n\nUnfortunately, wait times are insane in a crowded tiny little room, the people that make the food are not Mexican (and it shows), neither are the customers (because who wants to eat food appropriated from your home country's food, but missing the mark in terms of authenticity), and the product... well let's say it's a very good Canadian-ized version of Mexican fish tacos, but not really authentic, and while it is delicious and perhaps worthy of a 5, I prefer authenticity, especially when everyone in their (clueless) reviews is raving about how authentic this stuff is. Sigh. \n\nAnd sending me hate mail for my honest appraisal of it too. Sigh again.\n\nYou know it's not authentic by the stuff that goes in it, to put it bluntly. The ingredients are fancy, hipster, and gentrified. It's not Mexican. But it's \"inspired by Mexican\" and it's pretty damn good.\n\nThe reason it doesn't score 5 is three-fold:\n\n(a) it does bother me that people think it is something it isn't, and rave about its authenticity despite thelack thereof.\n\nBut moreso:\n\n(b) the prices are way too high for what you get. There is no way people should be charged this much for a couple of tacos. A Mexican place just wouldn't.\n\nAnd also:\n\n(c) the service was pretty awful. Hurried, annoyed, unfriendly, business-like. If you're going to charge me this much for faux-Mexican street food, at least be nice about robbing me blind.\n\nAll those criticisms aside, it's still really good food and worth trying. Just don't expect authentic. Love it for what it is - an expensive Canadian knock-off - and then maybe it'll be worth it.\n\nNow I've used up seven lives today so I only have two left. You'll have to excuse me. Meow.
