This is the main Zinburger that I go to and its one of my favorite interiors and atmospheres. The service is friendly and I almost get the same thing every time I'm here. I really enjoy the juicy burgers and it's one of my favorite places to go for one. The fries are also on point with the garlic and original fries.
