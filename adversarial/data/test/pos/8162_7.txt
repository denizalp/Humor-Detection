I grew up in the neighborhood and for some reason I thought Chino Bandido was a buffet. I was way off! I can't believe I waited so long to eat here but I am a little worried about my addiction to their chile relleno burrito. I think Chino Bandido made a deal with the devil when they created the best chile relleno ever! Its not your average chile relleno made with an egg its more like a giant jalepeno popper. I get it every time I come here with a veggie quesadilla and top it off with their yummy salsa. I am also obsessed with the snickerdoodle cookies and I don't really like cookies. The ordering system is kind of weird but if you act like its your first time there they'll just fill it out for you ;)
