I am torn between a 2 and 3... \n\nI stayed at Palazzo for my bachelorette and my although my friends wanted to stay at another hotel I was told the Prestige lounge made the stay exceptional. And for the most part it was great. The service is great. The drinks and food served are spot on.  But the management needs serious customer service. \n\nThey incorrectly charged me for an additional guest... I thought not a big deal, its day 1 of my weekend trip, Ill talk to the manger and they can confirm the guest count and reverse the charge... boy was I wrong. First I spoke with Thomas L nothing, then Peter C... nothing.. finally spoke to another manager and he finally agreed to reverse the incorrect charge. WOW! I mean, Im ordering room service having great dinners and have brought a party with me to your hotel and you are giving me a hard time over $100?! \n\nIf you go you'll have a great service and drinks but be warned check your statements and be ready to talk to many managers before anything is corrected.
