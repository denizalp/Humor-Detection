Las Vegas Yelpers, you guys rock for sharing about a great place like Babystacks!\n\nWe're from the SF Bay Area and we've had a few visits to Las Vegas the past year.  We're so over the usual stuff and just wanted to find a good breakfast that wasn't on the strip.  We Yelpers know that some of the best food can be found off the beaten path, right?  So my trusty Yelp App not only roped me in with an eye catching menu that had pancake choices like Smores, Banana Creme Pie, Red Velvet (cue eye pop here) but it also told me that this place is about 15 minutes from our hotel.  Sweet!  Off we go in our rental.\n\nProbably because we went on a weekday, we didn't experience a lengthy wait as mentioned in the other reviews.  During the 5 minutes we did have to hang out, I noticed the clean, casual & laid back surroundings with a bit of an island touch.  Cute butterflies everywhere.  I also saw the specials on the board and I knew I was in for a dilemma.  Almond Joy pancakes?  Orange creamsicle pancakes?  I asked for a menu to have an early look but by that time we were ready to be seated.\n\nI got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  It only comes in one size, and the order was HUGE.  The cream cheese syrup made each bite delightfully sweet and really went with the lemony, fluffy pancake.

I liked my pancakes, but I was coveting his plate the whole time.  The pork was tender and nicely salted with perfectly poached eggs.  I've never had this rendition of Eggs Benedict before and its a work of genius!  If it were me though, I'd throw in some spam in there (which I did order on the side; comes with two slices).  Note to self for the next time.  And I'm definitely getting my own. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=wgy9HFmRWyhY8IupO76RHw&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg\n\nThe Keikis enjoyed a short stack of Almond Joy pancakes (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=RziSeEnGuGZ-SfEMFhZXrg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg) and the combo meal that came with bacon, hash browns, eggs and a red velvet baby stack (no picture, sorry...my little girl inhaled it).  \n\nEverything was delicious.  We may have ventured off the strip, but we made our own smorgasbord here.  Service was sufficiently friendly and there is plenty of parking.  We will definitely be back when we visit this area again!
