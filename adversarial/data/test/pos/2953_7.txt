What a cool local bar! \nThere is a large parking lot, and the bar is bigger than the normal dive bar. \n\nWhat I really enjoyed is the Tijuana Hooker... ya know, because I like visiting Mexico! \nReally though, the mango flavor stands out and the spice is just right. \n\nI just came from dinner, so I didn't get to try the food. \nI will be back soon and will update the review with the food and more drinks! \nCheers!
