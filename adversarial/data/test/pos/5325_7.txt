This neighborhood owned Ace Hardware has been our go-to for fix-it help and items since we moved up here a year ago! Everyone at this shop cares about your success on your projects and is so happy to help! \n\nToday we were in for help replacing my car fob battery- a few weeks ago it was for replacement house keys, and before that it was for cleaning supplies and lightbulbs! \n\nAs we continue to make our house a home, this will be our one-stop-shop for helpful tips, tricks, and supplies!
