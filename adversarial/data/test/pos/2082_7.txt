Ate here with a large group (12 of us) on a Saturday night. We called in advance to make a reservation, which they ended up screwing up, and we had to wait for a table. They ended up giving us possibly one of the worst tables in the place, right by the door. At this point I was so hungry I was lightheaded, that I could have been seated on the floor for all I cared. \n\nSoooo our waitress comes, and suggests a pitcher of margaritas, and we said yes. Little did we know this pitcher was $30!!! More than my entire meal. Anyways, we ordered 4 orders of nachos as appetizers and then ordered our meals.\n\nWhen the nachos arrived, a few of us didn't have forks. Wow. I must have asked 30 different servers, a bartender, the hostess, and anyone else who looked like they could have possibly worked there for a damn fork, only to be told \"sure no problem.\" The 3 of us sat there for what felt like an hour waiting for our cutlery. Oh and we also didn't have napkins. These nachos were VERY messy, otherwise I wouldn't have cared.\n\nOne thing that stood out in my attempt to ask for cutlery was when I asked a waiter and was told \"we're working on it.\"\n\nFinally we got our stuff (after we finished the appetizers) and got our mains. The food was borderline gross, and the last straw for me was when I bit down on what felt like a rock in my burrito. I spit it out, and complained to the manager and was told it was an \"uncooked bean.\" They took my puney excuse of a meal off the $500 bill, and apologized.\n\nNot only would I never return here, I would never recommended this place to anyone who likes eating GOOD food, and who would like to keep their teeth intact.
