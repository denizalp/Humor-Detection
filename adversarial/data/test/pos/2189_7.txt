Very affordable internet service provider. Can be slow at certain times, i.e. 8-9 pm, not sure if this is the fault of CIK or Bell. Customer Service is not the greatest, since they have to contact Bell to do installations and etc. But otherwise satisfied with what I paid for.\n\nI have used Rogers, Bell, Teksavvy, before, they all suck. CIK isn't the best, but at least they are much more affordable than the other providers. Plus, no over use charges for data.
