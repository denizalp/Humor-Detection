Thank you to the service technician who was at my house in 30 minutes this morning.  \nI give him 5 stars and 6 if I could.  I highly recommend the prompt and thorough job he did for me at 8:00am this morning.  The issue was small but the fix was appreciated by me and my two golden retrievers who were able to be comfortable while I was at work.  I came home to a nice cold house just like I like it.  Thanks again Vanguard you guys ROCK!!!
