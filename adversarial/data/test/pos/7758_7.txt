My friend and I reserved a car for our Grand Canyon-Bryce Canyon-Zion National Park trip.  My friend is under 25 and spoke to someone about her corporate discount code which would cancel out the fee for being under 25.\n\nShe spoke to a rep on two occasions before the trip to confirm the code would work and that it was the right code.\n\nWhen we went to pick up our car, the code didn't work.\n\nI hate surprises, especially when it about doubles the cost we were expecting.  Maybe there was a misunderstanding on my friend's part when she called but I can't imagine how.  She called twice and she's not stupid.
