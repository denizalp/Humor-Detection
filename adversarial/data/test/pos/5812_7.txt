Heirloom tomato salad - perfect \nChicken liver toast - perfect (though asking if you can split for parties of two is a nice touch - not done)\nFarmers cheese on watermelon - perfect \nDeviled eggs - not really impressed bc the yolk stuffing overpowered roe caviar. Took 35 min plus after we ordered them. \nPotatoes with asparagus and grilled chicken - horrible. Potatoes were overcooked, hard, tasteless. Chicken came out 35 plus minutes late and tasted and looked like turkey breast found in deli counter. Server tried her best and our water and serving pieces were regularly replaced but it was not a great experience. Mgr David adjusted the bill and really tried to save face but I was tempted to ask him to eat the potato and asparagus salad (we did eat it while waiting for chicken and eggs btw). Took a few attempts to get check as well.
