I used to go here often.  I was never really happy with them, but I had to go some place and the price was cheap.  Let me tell you about my last experience there.  Upon arrival I had my name put on the list and waited for my turn.  Another guy arrived and the hostess let him go ahead of me.  I complained.  She stated that he had a reservation.  When my turn came I was seated next to the guy.  We began to talk.  He told me that he did not have a reservation.  Basically, the hostess let him go ahead of me because he was younger and better looking than me.  I vowed to never go to any Supercuts ever again.  I know I should not condemn a whole chain because of the rude actions of one person, but that is what I have done.
