Fatty delicious goodness! I'm so sad this is their last remaining location... it sucks how far this is from my house (or maybe it's for the best!). \n\nThey have so-called \"diet\" fried chicken. Somehow they claim it's less fatty and less calorific because they pull off the skin THEN fry it. Hmmm.. I don't buy that this stuff is healthy, but damn it tasted awesome. Plus I loved how they let me get 2 legs unlike most fried chicken places that require you to get a leg\/thigh combo. \n\nWe also tried the cloqueetos (ok that doesn't look right, but it's spelled something like that!).. so they are basically just chicken taquitos with tons of cheese and lettuce and salsa. Delish, but they definitely could have used some sour cream. \n\nMashed potatoes and gravy were heavenly. \n\nBiggest disappointment was the gross cold rolls that came out of a bag. Fried chicken places typically have YUMMY homemade rolls\/bisquits.. SOMETHING... wtf is up with the crappy grocery store sh*t guys? Otherwise this place was greasy goodness.
