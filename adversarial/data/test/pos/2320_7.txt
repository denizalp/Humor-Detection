Very strange experience.\n\nWe came here the other night to grab a quick bite and play some video poker.  We walked in and there were a few people around the bar, not too busy.\n\nWe ordered wings and had drinks.  There was a fruit fly in my drink so I had to have the bartender remake it.  My friend has extensive knowledge of beers and was asking about what kinds of porters and different things they had and the bartender didn't have good knowledge of beer at all.\n\nAs we were there for a bit we noticed the people around the bar were definitely regulars.  There was one lady who clearly knew the bartender who was having an argument with him.  \n\nThen there were 2 guys who came inside who we noticed were sitting in their car with their lights off, at the time we arrived, which was probably an hour before they came inside.  It could have been a coincidence but they had words with the bartender and they went to the bathroom and then so did he.  Definitely seemed sketchy so say the least.  \n\nI'll definitely stick to my PTs and Sierra gold.  This experience definitely left us unsettled.
