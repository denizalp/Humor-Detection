I went there for macarons, and it was my lucky day!  I was served by the owner, I think.  She was an older (and very French) woman, who everyone called \"Madame\".  There were also younger staff present, but \"Madame\" came over to help me.  I told her I was there to eat macarons! And she was very friendly, attentive, and generous!  She described all the flavours to me, and I asked for one of each.  She then proceeded to give me triple of each!!  And she told the cashier girl to ring up only the amount I asked for (which was 6 macarons).  I ended up with a hefty little brown paper sack of macarons.  God bless her for feeding my greedy soul.  \n\nEach macaron is slightly larger than a toonie.  Flavours the day I went were: Raspberry, Chocolate, Coffee, Pistachio, Lemon, and Vanilla.  The flavours were done nicely.  I always love seeing black vanilla seeds in an authentic Vanilla.  Pistachio contained finely ground nuts, yummy.  Something funny happened when I bit into the Lemon; my teeth hit something plastic-like, and I was like, WTF?!  I pulled the tiny piece out of my mouth and found it was a piece of actual lemon zest (aka peel)!  So after a sigh of relief (and pleasure), I give Patachou two thumbs up!
