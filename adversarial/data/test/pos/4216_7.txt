Gorgeous local casino! Probably one of my favorites. \n\nRooms are spacious, bright and clean. Huge bathrooms so thats a plus!\n\nTons of Amenities. Spa, pool, restaurants...\n\nThe pool..love it! Its not tiny like some lol casinos. It has a beach side sand entry. Fun for the kids! They also have an adult pool if your traveling without kids.\n\nThe district is right outside the casino so that allows for shopping and some extra spots to eat.  \n\nSuper cute area!!!
