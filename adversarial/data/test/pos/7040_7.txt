I was torn between giving this place one star or two stars.  It's not so horrible that I'd never step foot in the door again, so I gave it two.  Its only saving grace are the drinks.\n\nI should note that I wasn't expecting much for a chain restaurant in Stow, OH.  But it doesn't take that much skill to work a deep fryer, so I assumed it would be passable.  Ha.  You know what they say about assuming.\n\nI met a group of friends here on a Friday night for drinks.  Of course, drinking leads to eating, so it wasn't long before we were ordering food.  Being a vegetarian, I had about 3 options on the menu.  I chose the cheese quesadilla and french fries (healthy, I know).  The quesadilla was ridiculously bland: cheddar cheese metled between flour tortillas with a jalapeno slice or two.  Boring.  But that wasn't even the worst part of this plate.  The sour cream was.  They put PESTO in the sour cream.  Yes, you read that right.  Pesto in the sour cream.  I nearly gagged on it.  You'd think they would at least warn people that they do this.  Who wants pesto sour cream on a quesadilla?  I could see maybe putting pesto sour cream on a baked potato, but come on.  Seriously?  I had to ask for some plain sour cream, but even that couldn't save the quesadilla.  And the fries?  Mushy and flavorless.  \n\nNone of my companions complained about their meals, but none of my companions are foodies by any means.  They're all quite content with the subpar restaurants that inhabit the town of Kent.  So hey, if you have no tastebuds, you might like this place too.\n\nLuckily, they do serve very large, strong, fairly cheap drinks.  I ordered some sort of raspberry concoction they list on their drink menu and it was served in a goblet.  Hence the two stars instead of one.  Two of those babies plus two shots, and I didn't even mind the people bellowing karaoke off-tune.\n\nUnless your soul goal for the evening is to get trashed and sing karaoke, pass this place by.
