Time to update.  Stop in Los Chiludos every once in a while.  Always get a good meal.  They have a few specials on the chalk board and I always look at the menu while in line because I try different items every time.  Recently stopped in and the special was Shrimp tacos.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and tasty.  Service is always friendly.
