The more often I come, the more I like this restaurant.  That's why I'm changing the rating for this restaurant from 4 stars to 5.\n\nEach time I come here, I'm greeted right away by a warm smile from the waitress.  This just goes to show you, a warm smile goes a long way to make a costumer feel welcome.\n\nI'm sure the waitress can't be having a good day everyday like the rest of us, but she still always manages to give her costumers a great smile.\n\nI continue to like the comp salad and miso soup.  Always warmly received by me. \n \nAnd I have to say, the sushi chef is clever.  Every time I've ordered their sashimi, it always comes with more slices than indicated on the menu.  The slices might be a bit thin, but as the costumer, I feel good because I feel like I'm getting just a bit more than what I ordered which makes me appreciate the place.\n\nI agree with curious g.'s review that if the sashimi platter is dressed up a bit more with more varied vegetables, that would really bring the dish up a notch.\n\nThis last time my friend ordered the bebimbop and she said the dish was very good.\n\nI hope this restaurant continues to improve and I hope the smiling waitress continues to work there.
