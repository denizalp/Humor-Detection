5\/5 KBBQ!\n\nNever thought that would ever happen. Gen is the newest hot spot in town and man they aren't lying when they say premium quality! Not just the meat, but the rest of the food and service as well. Samuel was our server and he did an excellent job making sure we were taken care of. Yuhao was also awesome and super sweet!!! I'm a big fan of BBQ so this hit the spot.\n\nMust haves:\nBrisket\nBulgolgi\nBeef tongue\nPremium steak\n\nI love how fast they are when it comes to service and bringing out the food and our requests. Even when we sat down everything (the sides and salad) was prepared already! Their Shirley temple is yummy and they constantly filled our drinks. Gonna try the bar drinks next time... Soju is on the menu heheh.\n\nAwesome spot definitely will bring my boyfriend here!
