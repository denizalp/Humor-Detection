Well, Terry and Kathy have done it again. I had to have a new alternator installed on my vehicle and Terry got me a good price on the part and reasonable installation cost as well. I could not have been more pleased again with the service. I can't tell you how much I appreciate not only the reasonable price  but also the friendly and cordial atmosphere I get every time I go to them for service. I will continue to use them for my service needs.
