I've been to Esther's Kitchen three times--twice for dinner and this time for lunch.  Lunch is a bit different.  When you enter, you order at the bar from the lunch menu.  Then take a table marker with a card, have a seat, and your lunch is served when it's ready.  \n\nFour of us shared three pastas, two sandwiches, a Margherita pizza, and one dessert.  The two rigatoni dishes were excellent. The one with black garlic and lemon was something very different and delightful.  The sandwiches were great especially the roasted porchetta.\n\nAll breads and pastas are made in house and it shows in the fresh taste and deliciousness of them.\n\nWhether for lunch or dinner, this is a place you need to try.  Chef Trees and his staff are doing fantastic things.  The passion with which they cook shines through!
