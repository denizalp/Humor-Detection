Don't come here for the food. Come here to get your piss on. PROPER. Don't sit down at a table and look for service. Belly up to the bar and chat up your bartender! Order booze... talk to your neighbour! This is a Tavern not a Bistro. In fact, I think they should have nothing here but pickled eggs and pepperoni. There are still old men at the bar reading newspapers-- I LOVE THIS!\nPlaces like this are drowning in modern douche-dom. Speaking of which-- one of my favourite Pilot pastimes is to watch the dressed up douches stroll in as their tarty girlfriends sneer at the decor and some of the clientele they deem to be \"eeeew\".\n\nTime to drink...goin' to the Pilot.
