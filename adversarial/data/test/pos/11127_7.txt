YUCK!!!! This hotel sucks! My brother, my friend, and I stayed here once. Literally, this was the first hotel we say getting off the freeway, and it was about $100 per night. First, the AC didn't work, and this is in the middle of summer in LV, air conditioning is a necessity rather than a luxury. So we got another room, where the AC STILL didnt work. Thats when we looked around and noticed something: if you happen to be a john, this is where you take your prostitute. Cigar stains on the mismatched comforters, weird, nasty shag carpet, and the channel that automatically comes on when you flip the television on: hardcore pornography. After setting out toward the MGM Grand, we proceeded to get hammered, and just spent the $$$ and got a great room at the Flamingo Hilton
