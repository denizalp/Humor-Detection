This was like a pilgrimage.\n\nOn a gigantic hill sits a large church with a museum dedicated to a priest named Brother Andre.\n\nThey have his waxed likeness, like the wax museum, but even creepier they even have his mummified heart in a jar with a prayer that you can say for a blessing.\n\nThis church is beautiful, and there are plenty of candles to light with a fee of course.\n\nAlong the was are crutches and canes from those who have been healed.\n\nA great destination for anyone who's religious or is just interested in churches and buildings in general.\n\nAnd for all of you lazy people who don't want to walk a half a mile uphill there's a free shuttle!
