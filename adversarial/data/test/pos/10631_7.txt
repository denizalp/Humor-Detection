I've been to Tryst before and this time around was so much better. I'm going to say that Sunday night at Tryst is SIGNIFICANTLY better than Friday or Saturday nights for a couple of reasons.\n\n1. Less crowded. It was busy but not overly busy that you had to wait in a line for more than an hour. We waited like 5 minutes max.  Also, the dance floor was poppin but it wasn't so packed that you could barely move. It took us maybe 5 minutes to get a drink instead of 20 minutes due to the crowd. Seriously, it's just the right amount of busy-ness that makes it a party but you can still breathe and move around.\n\n2. Great Music. It was non-stop great music. Hip hop, top 40, remixes, etc. It was fabulous.\n\n3. The People. I think more locals go on Sunday. It just felt like a great party with no one to impress. Everyone just wanted to dance and drink and have a good time!!\n\nOverall, my friends and I had a great time! We paid no cover and we had a group of 40 of us. Some of us got bottle service though. But still, no cover and we had tons of guys with us too. We rolled in around 1045pm and had no problem getting in. Some were on the guestlist and some were not.  It was such a fun night. Too perfect! We never left the dance floor!
