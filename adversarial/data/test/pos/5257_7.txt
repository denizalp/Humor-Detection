My wife and I live in California and we were visiting friends who took us here. Great call, guys! This is the kind of place that I wish I could drive to, let alone walk to.\n\nWe decided to dine in the outdoor beer garden. We shared the Veggie Burger and the Veggie Deluxe. The Burger was hearty and one of the best black bean burgers I've ever had. I was skeptical of the Deluxe seeing that it contained both hummus and baba ghanouj, but it turned out to be a perfect combination. The draft beer selection kicked ass. There were even a couple of cask-conditioned beers. Welcome to the 'burgh!\n\nWe returned a few days later because of the bottled beer selection. We grabbed a few to take home that are unavailable where we live. Fortunately, the cashier suggested that we get six so that we would be eligible for the discount. We even got a loaf of free bread that turned out to be really good. I could get used to this!\n\nHow did I get to be the Duke? I am a benevolent leader, but I believe the title belongs with a local. Come to Carson Street Deli, Pittsburghers! Craft beer and delicious sandwiches. What more do you need? I shall definitely return the next time I'm in your fair city.
