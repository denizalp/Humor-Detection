This library is awful. As soon as you step in, you feel like you've stepped into 1973, and their book collection reflects that. Because of the huge Portuguese, Chinese and Vietnamese populations in the area, they carry a lot of multicultural content, which is good if you speak any of those languages. Unfortunately, I don't, and their selection of English language materials just doesn't cut it.\n\nI used to live a block away from here and the best way I found to use this library was as a departures and arrivals branch-- the one good thing about the Toronto Public Library is that you can go online and request the books you want to be sent to your local library. So I got them sent to Sanderson, picked them up, and dropped them off when I was done.\n\nBesides that, don't expect to find anything great to read, and especially don't go here if you need to research something -- you will not find it. There are a million better libraries, check them out instead.
