If you build it, they will come.  This may have worked for Field of Dreams, not so much for the Do It Yourself Bloody Mary bar at the Side Door.  We happened to wander in after learning about the 1 hour+ wait at a nearby brunch hotspot (pure definition of first world problems).  The place was empty but with happy hour 2:1 on rail drinks, bloodies, and tap beer, we were in no hurry to leave.  They have an impressive tap beer selection and while the tomato juice for the DIY bloody marys was a tad sweet, the \"add-ins\" were top notch. Speaking of top notch, the homemade tater tots were incredible.  Larger than the typical tot, the tater tot was the perfect mixture of crispy outside and soft inside.  I would come back just for them.
