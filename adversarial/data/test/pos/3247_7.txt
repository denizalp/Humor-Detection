The food made me feel like I was in Purgatory.\n\nThis restaurant is older and dated looking. The decor is perhaps entertaining. They have a cut away ceiling that looks like an artificial sky. Unless you are blind you will view a very large mural of a naked woman with nude cherubs flying above her and other various Italian artworks and Portraits.\n\n As soon as I tasted the bread and seasoned oil I became uncertain about how dinner would be. The bread tasted like that frozen bread dough that comes in a can and the extra virgin olive oil was oddly flavorless.\n\nReally I don't need to describe my husband's Florentine Cannelloni too much because if you take the time to view the photo you can see it looks like a coyote took a dump on the plate. The dump part was actually dried up crushed meatballs and other God knows what else. I was told by my husband that the inside of the cannelloni's were awful. My husband just kept saying,\"not good\" \"not good\". I did taste one of the gnocchi on his plate. It was much firmer than I was expecting and was a very chewy lump of dough that was covered with a mushroomy tasting paste that was just reminded me of the paste  that came in the plastic tub you used in elementary school but it was mushroom flavored paste.\n\nThe actual on-line menu differs from the menu at the restaurant. I like Sun Fish and was expecting to order it but I noticed it wasn't on the menu so I went with the Salmon Francesca. I didn't expect the best quality fish since this isn't a fish place but I was shooting for OK since it was $23.99. At that price point IT SHOULD BE OK!  I took a bite of the fish and tasted a very overpowering sour tangy garlicy sauce. The lemon butter, white wine, caper sauce was so strong in flavor I actually couldn't taste the fish at all until the third bite. Then I knew why the sauce was so strong. The fish had that off taste. It wasn't spoiled but it was that off taste like when you purchase fish from Fry's or Safeway kind of taste. I couldn't eat it after the third bite. The vegetables on the plate were OK and the the Italian Potato was tasty but would have been better if the cheese wasn't dried out and crunchy on it.\n\nOur waiter was extremely friendly and entertaining. I considered giving this place another star just because of the waiter. Before I knew how the fish was our waiter did ask us how the food was and I did tell him about the sauce.  He said that if we came back they could do the dish different for me. \n\n\nGood Luck!\n\nIf you give this place a try you should use the coupon on their website or one of the other various discounts they offer.\n\n1.5 stars
