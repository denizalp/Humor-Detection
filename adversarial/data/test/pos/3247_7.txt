This business is Trash. Always has been, always will be. The owner of this business is a liar and it's evident who has been telling the truth after all these years. Let it be known Amanda attempted to sue for 1400 twice the value I paid for the couch and barely got awarded 700. Because Vdub never picked up the furniture so I was charged for usage. She did not have the land slide victory she's conveying. She also wore a very tight and revealing dress to court with a hoodie. Lol, hilarious. This business is trash!!!
