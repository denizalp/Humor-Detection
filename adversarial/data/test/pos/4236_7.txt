I went to get a pair of prescription eyeglasses at Lenscrafters.  I had seen my friend wearing a pair of non-prescription eyeglasses for Hallowe'en, and asked if I could steal them and make them into my real glasses.  I then took them to Lenscrafters, with my prescription in hand, and asked if they could put new lenses in the frames.\n\nThe lady said no problem, took my eye measurements, took my prescription, and said I could come back in a week.  I thankfully had benefits at the time, so even though the cost was $270, I only paid $70 out of pocket.  Otherwise, I would be even more mad than I already am.\n\nWithin two weeks, the frames started to crack (they're plastic).  I decided to take them to the place I used to get my eyeglasses from.  The man behind the counter said that the type of frame doesn't hold such a thick lens, and that he couldn't even glue it back together because it would never supposed the lens.  They ended up just falling apart right on my face.  The woman at Lenscrafters should have told me this and never should have bothered putting in my prescription once she saw the quality of the frames I brought in.  :(  Such a disappointment, and I can't get new glasses for 2 years with benefits.
