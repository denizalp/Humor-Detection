Dear Graze, \n\nI am SO mad at you! We have encountered one another twice so far--and you never meet up to the hype. \n\nNo one would write a letter to another person like that, so continuing... I haven't heard a bad thing about Graze from any of the locals. It's beautiful, everyone seems to love it. The first time I went, I had the bibimbap bowl. It tasted like kimchi and that's about it, so if you like kimchi then go for it! I don't crave fermented cabbage on the daily, so it would have been more appetizing to me if there were more flavor profiles. Aside from this, the rest of our experience was pretty \"meh.\" Nothing to write home about. Service, cheese board... Meh.\n\nThe second time I went, the food was better, but the service was out the window. We sat for upwards of 25 minutes before being greeted by our server, who I had been watching the whole time to see if she would notice our empty table. (Yeah, I'll creep like that when I've been waiting for 5 minutes already.) I had to go back to the host table to get the ball rolling, and then we waited for another 7 minutes before she came over. Not sorry--this is inexcusable. \n\nIf you go for brunch, order the bibimbap burrito and some cheese curds, but have fun waiting an hour. I am just not going to deal with it again...
