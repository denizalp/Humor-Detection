Kingsley is a 6 month old Weimaraner\/German Shorthaired Pointer mix with energy to spare.  He loves APR and I love it because he comes home tired every time!  A full day there will normally temper his energy for the next day as well!  They're great about socializing and their report cards are so cute!  I'm very pleased, they're inexpensive and it's so handy to have the vet right there if ever there's a problem.  I highly recommend it!
