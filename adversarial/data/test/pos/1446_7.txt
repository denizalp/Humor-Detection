On the stretch of road that is between the Encore (awesome) and the Riviera (dumpy) my friend and I came across a strip mall.  We were heading for Circus Circus, just for the pure curiosity of seeing a casino based around clowns.  I was starving, so the A-frame sign on Las Vegas Blvd caught my eye...$5.99 lunch special.  After a bit of meandering around the crappy shopping plaza, next to the closed wedding chapel we found Ping Pong Thai.  It was late afternoon, so it was pretty empty.  \n\nOverall, I think it was a winner. The Thai food wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was definitely good.  The service was very nice and prompt.  The prices were really low.  Our check was so small I felt bad for the waitress, especially since she told us she had been stiffed by a party earlier in the day that returned their 'cashew chicken' because it had cashews in it.  Rejects.  Anyway, so I left her about a 75% tip.\n\nI suppose this is the new Ping Pong, as there is one already on Sunset Road.  \n\nIf you are staying at the Encore and want to save a bit of money, you might want to pop in here for lunch or dinner.
