First time coming here. The menu is confusing, unless you speak Italian you'll be asking what some things are. It's very expensive for what you get. (The size of say a papa johns that's a small was 20.00) Think of it more as a very nice place to do dinner, but you don't have to dress up. The pizza I received was not what I ordered. ..luckily we caught it before we got all the way home. They put a new one in right away and apologized. The pizza itself isn't that spectacular for the price\/size. This place is entirely for the feel\/atmosphere. The staff was friendly and helpful...I think they need to revamp the menu and drive down price if they want to stay open.
