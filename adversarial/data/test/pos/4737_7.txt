I can almost guarantee that you will regret even stepping past the threshold of this company! They ran a hard inquiry on mine and my husband's credit even after I told them we were just looking, he insured me that the paperwork was just to see what was in our price range, and I'm not stupid so I asked him again not to run our credit through a hard inquiry and this man orencio I believe was his name, and the salesmen jarrod both told me it was a soft check and wouldn't affect my credit score, well we looked at a few cars in the lot with our salesman jarrod and I asked were the otherwise who was helping us went.. No one knew so I literally ran inside the building to stop this guy and another employee brought him out to me, he apologized for taking so long and explained that we could purchase a vehicle up to 22,000.. I asked to see the paperwork and he confirmed that he ran a hard inquiry and already had our monthly payments set up and was way ahead of himself we were only LOOKING! I was furious and he didn't seem to mind at all! We finally left after he tried to pull out every trick in the book to get us to stay.. He even told us that if we wanted a certified pre owned vehicle that we would need to buy it that day because the east coast is buying up all of Arizona's vehicles because the hurricanes and floods destroyed most of the cars on the east coast, my husband couldn't believe what this guy was saying! I myself was shocked.. My husband and I lived through a couple of crazy tornados when he was stationed in North Carolina in the military and I know that it didn't wipe out all of the pre owned vehicles in the are, a few yes, but this man was so full of himself and so pathetic! I'm so embarrassed for this company! And their lack of honesty and professionalism!
