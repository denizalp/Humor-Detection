Maybe I'm jaded and getting older, but I just can't see myself spending $200 for a wine bottle holder that looks like abstract art, or salad tongs that look like two people kissing. However, walking in here is like going to the Museum of Industrial Design where you can buy things are fairly reasonable (for this kind of stuff) prices. \n\nI used to love coming here and doing just that. Perusing, and making a mental note that one day, when I have lots of disposable money, I can buy things here. I used to enjoy doing just this, and daydreaming of the day - but now, no matter what I earn,I am way too practical and know that I will probably never justify something of the like. It doesn't have the same appeal anymore, and I just get upset.  \n\nThat's where the extension of Bergo Designs comes in. Up the stairs is a funkier, younger, somehow more useful, yet completely useless items can be bought. Like a phone holder that looks like a hand, or the OCD cutting board, or funny ice cub trays.  It's a great gift store - these are things that people would always want but would never buy for  themselves, and for the most part, are useful too!\n\nYou'll also find Alessi and Bodum products here. (But there is a Bodum store in the Distillery - I compared the prices and it's a teeny bit cheaper over there, not by much)\n \nIn the back, are expensive but impressive looking, children's toys.   \n\nLike almost all the stores in the Distillery, walk in with no intention, and you won't be disappointed.
