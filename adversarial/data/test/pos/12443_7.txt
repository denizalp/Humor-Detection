So one day we're waiting on a prescription and absolutely ravenous. We avoided all of the chains and stumbled on Heidi's while turning around in their parking lot. \n\nThe place was VERY clean. The owners(?) were there, and very friendly. My husband got a BLT and it was pretty good. I got the 'Awesome Salad' and it was anything but awesome. Chopped iceburg, DICED tomatoes, slices of mozzarella and what has GOT to be pre-packed quacamole (it tasted like rotten eggs) - all jammed into a clear plastic to-go container. \n\nI've never been so angry about a salad.
