This is the scene-iest coffee shop I've ever been to. Like, did I even have enough cool points to enter? Like, I'm surrounded by the most beautiful people, and also the most hipster, and also the pinkest leather couches and chairs, and it's some old industrial chic thing, and no real sign on the building, and seriously, I do not have enough cool points to enter.\n\nAnd yet, I did enter.\n\nAnd I sorta loved it. Ya, it's a bit of a scene. You just kinda crowd the barista area and get your coffee (drip only) and some kind of pastry or scone. Then you camp out on the sofas, the tables, the big communal tables in one of the back rooms, or just sit and soak it in. On this particular day, one of the back rooms had a news feed projected on the wall, showing the big political event of the day. No idea if they always show news\/tv\/whatever, but that could be interesting too.\n\nThere's a small menu of prepared dishes as well, but I didn't grab one. It looked to be like small comfort breakfast foods with an elevation. The ambiance is quintessentially hipster, but I actually love that in this case. Why do some people think that's a bad thing? Well dressed dudes with beards and dreads, and delightfully modern women with vintage dresses? Ya, I'm down. I'm not cool enough for that crowd, but I'm down.\n\nWhite chocolate apricot scone is a hit, as was the quiche lorraine. I'm not a coffee dude, but caffeine snobs might not love that you can't get a pour over. Get over it. Pop in, join the army of laptop warriors, and stay a while. Are you cool enough?
