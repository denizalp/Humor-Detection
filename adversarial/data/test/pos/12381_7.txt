Review is for our impression of the casino only.  We came here on a Friday afternoon primarily for dim sum lunch (separate review for Pearl Ocean).  Lucky Dragon is probably the newest casino on the Strip, definitely catering to Chinese customers.  Most signs are in Chinese, with English subtitles.  The waitresses dressed in red Chinese traditional dresses.  Its definitely one of the prettier casinos in terms of decoration and layout.\n\nThe gaming area itself was really tiny.  All the manned tables were Baccarat, and all the Blackjack and Ultimate Holdem Tables were empty without any dealers.  Baccarat is the favorite game of most hardcore Chinese gamblers, like those you find in Macau.  Despite the favorable player odds and James Bond influences, we prefer Ultimate Holdem and Blackjack for more excitement.\n\nWould be worth coming here once to check out the gorgeous views, but the casino is too small and there's not enough variety of games.  We'll gamble elsewhere. 5 stars for the decor -2 stars for the gaming area for 3 stars.
