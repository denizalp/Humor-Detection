Dropping a star and here's why...  (copied from and email I sent Steve)\n\n\"We drive from the West Side to buy toys all the time.  The dude with the long dreads is literally one of the nicest, genuine people I have ever met.  So cool.  The dude with the short dark hair is one of the most miserable pieces of work I have ever met.  How can ya be such a dick surrounded by all those cool toys?\n\nSide Note:  The My Little Pony section is severely lacking and my daughter is bummed....
