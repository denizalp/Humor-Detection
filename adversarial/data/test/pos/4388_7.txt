I've been going to this location since 2005 and have noticed its quality in product has dropped severely.  No more of their dried out carne today I get carne jerky ! Black as it gets too mmmm appealing. Then I call the manager to tell them and all I hear is this cannot be.  Please it's not the first time it's happened and it won't be the last its just the last time I'm dealing with paying money for crap praying it will be consistent.  Now I'm leaving my home office to go and return my food.  The manager gives and offers no customer service as I am here.  \"do you wanna you money back or what ?\" Ummmm  if any of my managers acted as such id be outraged. How about you as the manager make a decision to do what is right to make a customer.  I would have returned my money and made my food for free. This is ridiculous the lack of consideration knowing I had to take time out of my day to come back so they could fix their mistake.  I do business consulting and this restaurant needs major customer service manners.  I got my food remade because I will be writing reports for he next 7 hours and one taco and one quesadilla last for a long long time ! But to the white headed manager \/ owner learn how to treat your clients.  Do you offer to pay me my value for my personal time , my gas money ? No all very horrid service and I and all my friends as they read this on Yelp face book and Twitter @jennysook holler will know your customer service needs a major attitude adjustment !! Your hand delivered food to my table and a sorry was too little too late ! Have a better more apologetic attitude like that from the beginning not when I show up with my food showing you the travesty you served that you find edible giving me no excuse why it was served to be in the first place
