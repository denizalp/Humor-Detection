This is my new go-to pizza place. You get your choice of crust, sauce and all the toppings that you could want for $8. Well, except for anchovies, but that's only the minorest of gripes. The toppings are fresh, even if the sausage is pretty much \"sausage crumbles\", it's still tasty. And it takes all of 5 minutes to bake your pizza. It's not fancy artesan pizza, nor do they claim to be. It's all about customization. The pizza is your creation, what YOU want on a pizza. Want a pizza with gorgonzola, feta and pineapple? Well, there you go. Want a barbeque chickpea and olive pizza? It's yours.\n\nThe staff is also great. Tons of help as you walk through your order. The girl who helped me last time was Sabrina. She was great! She just kept piling on toppings!\n\nI didn't even mention their salads. They are $8.99, but they are size of a basketball (well, half a basketball). If you get a salad and a pizza, its enough for 3 people! You can get any and all of the same pizza toppings on the salad. I recommend the raspberry vinaigrette.\n\nAll in all, I can't wait to go back!
