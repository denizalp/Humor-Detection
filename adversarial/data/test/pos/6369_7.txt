Lately I have been fortunate enough to enjoy four 5-star restaurant experiences at restaurants I had never frequented before.  Two serve Italian fare.  One is known for both its steaks and seafood.  And the remaining establishment maintains a laser-sharp focus on seafood.  Two of these are located in the Las Vegas valley, and the other two are situated deep in Southern California.  I will review these culinary gems one by one, beginning now.\n\nDon Michael's was introduced to me and Diane by friends who were surprised by an excellent Italian meal they chanced upon here.  They accompanied us to the ristorante's nondescript entrance at the corner of a small strip mall.  Here 40 seats await lucky diners.  And a bell rings every time someone enters.\n\nRight out of the gate with the first appetizer of Baked Mozzarella with warm Marinara Sauce, I knew this place was something special.  Then when I learned that the owners have operated Italian restaurants for decades, and are the parents of fabled Chef Marc of Parma and Novecento fame, I knew why everything tasted so good.  The quality of food preparation here rests on a bedrock of Italian cooking experience, high quality ingredients, and credibility.\n\nThe Mozzarella Marinara was gooey and excellent.  Fried Calamari with Marinara Sauce was golden and delicious.  An Antipasto Salad for one (me) consisted of Romaine and Green Leaf Lettuce, Roasted Peppers, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, Black Olives, Capicolla, Italian salami, ham, Cherry Peppers, cheese crumbles, and very tasty panels of Provolone.  Dressed with a very zesty Italian Dressing (I had to ask for more), this was one fine sampling of antipaasto.  \n\nPerhaps over-ordering a bit, I next savored a great cup of Pasta Fagioli that was chockfull of Canneloni Beans, carrots, and Ditalini Pasta, along with an excellent bowl of Homemade Italian Wedding Soup sporting meatballs, carrots, spinach, celery, and strips of white meat chicken swimming in an excellent broth.  Complimentary Garlic Bread was addictive.       \n\nFor my main, Veal Marsala was excellent served up with a liquidy brown Marsala Sauce and assorted mushrooms.  I will surely return for more of the same.
