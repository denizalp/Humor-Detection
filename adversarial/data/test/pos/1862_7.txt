And who says the city doesn't know how to have fun!\n\nEVENT\nI was late to the event but still had a great time!  I probably missed all the speeches!\n\nThey had great acts.\nShawn Desman\nDivine Brown \nand Sarah Slean\n\nThey sang live!! (At least I think they did). And now I have a new respect for Shawn Desman.  He was fantastic!  The singers sang a couple of songs which was just enough to get a feel for them but not too many to get bored.\n\nFIRECRACKERS\nThe fire crackers were really great too! I mean, it might not have been your \"in the US...firecrackers are so much better\" type of display as one bystander put it. But it was still very decent and well coordinated with the music.\n\nThey also tricked us b\/c they had a few firecrackers when Divine Brown was singing and most of us thought...oh...the fireworks weren't that great. And then a minute later, they started the real firecracker display.  It was really funny too see the fireworks bounce off the city hall buildings like balls being thrown around.\n\nGREAT IDEA\nspectators had the opportunity to text the number displayed on the jumbo screen and have their message displayed in front of everyone!\n\nWEATHER\nand the weather couldn't have been more perfect. It wasn't windy and it wasn't cold. Everything was perfect.\n\nCHRISTMAS CHEER\nI know in Canada everyone is concerned about inclusiveness so that's why we now say \"happy holidays\". But F that. I was so happy to hear christmas songs sung by the artists.  Eventhough I'm not religious, I think it's still acceptable to have traditional christmas songs sung at public events.  I don't think this action is excluding anyone or being biased to any particular religion in any way. Canada recognizes other peoples holiday's i.e. Eid, hanukkah etc and allows people time off work and school to celebrate so I say why can't we recognize christmas as well. \n\nSo I was happy to hear those songs.
