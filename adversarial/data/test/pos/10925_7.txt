This is the only cafe in the sketchiest part of the downtown core.  I used to live in this area and got to know John and Lina (sp? crap!) very well.  They are brother and sister and work very hard.  I like to stop by from time to time just to say hello because they are such nice, wonderful people.  Honestly, they have to put up with a lot of crazy folk.  A LOT.\n\nThis isn't the type of place I would go to just to check it out, because of the shady neighbourhood and messed up people. HOWEVER, if you happen to live in this area you have to check out the place.  They have a really mean burger and delicious spaghetti and meatballs, among other things.  They also have free computers and internet use for customers.
