I worked with Mark several years ago on some sunscreens. I just recently asked Mark to give me an estimate on some work.  I am shocked that Mark's quote was twice the amount of the second quote I received.  My recommendation:  do your homework and get at least two quotes to compare.  There is no misinterpretation on my part:  I was very specific as to what I needed and the second company checked all the boxes here too.
