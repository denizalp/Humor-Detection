As a man being a prodominately female store I may have stumbled upon a wonderful secret. The secret of this Michaels is it probably the quietest place to take a dump on the whole strip. While bathroom to myself through whole ordeal of pushing out a brown child. While the bathroom could do with some polish and a hard scrub it is fairly clean, stocked and inviting. Would drop my kids off at the pool here again. Why deuce on the strip with noisy bathrooms? \n\nThanks michaels also minus one star for the sand paper for toilet paper.
