Zydrunas Ilgauskas used to hang out here all the time and get ripped. It is rumored to be his favorite bar. It is nothing special but a decent place in Lakewood with a crowd that doesn't have much riff raff. There are two separate rooms, one with pool tables, one to drink and eat in. It is one of the better bars on the west side of Lakewood.
