To be honest, we kind of found this place to be a bit disappointing. Even with our 25% AAA discount, not quite worth the cost of admission.\n\nYou have a mix of the very well done, okay, and not so okay likenesses. We didn't care for the Whitney Houston figure at all. The Marvel 4D animated movie at the end of the tour kind of redeemed things.  Alright I guess for what will be our first and only visit. I hope the Hollywood Madam Tussauds is a little better.
