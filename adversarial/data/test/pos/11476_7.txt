Basic, generic Mexican kind-of-fast food restaurant, but like many of its brethren in that genre of eatery, it serves decent-quality stick-to-the-ribs fare. I do like the fact that they have a drive-in that's open way late at night, so that I can still get a tasty and substantial  dinner after a very late night at work.
