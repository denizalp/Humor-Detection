I visited Slickables last night. I thought it was a pretty decent place to hit up whenever you have a craving for sweets. The ice cream sandwiches are only $2, so why not, right?\n\nOther than the affordability and proximity aspects of Slickables, I wouldn't really go out of my way to go here. I didn't think the cookies or ice cream were incredibly wonderful tasting. I had the red velvet and white chocolate macadamia cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream in between. Even in my state of hunger, I was not that impressed.\n\nThe decor is definitely lacking. More seating would be great, and seats that aren't dilapidated.
