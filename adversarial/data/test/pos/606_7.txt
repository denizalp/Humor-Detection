It was either AGRA, or the Tandoori House three doors down. AGRA had people in it, Tandoori House did not. The choice was obvious, or so I thought.\n\nYou know those TV shows like Kitchen Nightmare, or Restaurant Makeover? Well, this restaurant was like the 'Before' photo. Agra is at the heart of North York, yet I felt like I was at a ethnic eatery in the middle of Owen Sound. This place literally felt shabbier than the Boston Pizza across the street...or any Boston Pizza for that matter. \nI came here with Chris. At this point of my life, the closest I've come to Indian food is packaged samosas found at my local No Fills, in the $10 value section. I guess you can say; I was pretty excited about ordering. I've been watching Gordon Ramsay's episode of Great Escape to India all day, and curry was all I could think of.\n\nChris: Butter Chicken with some kind of rice. Diet Coke.\nMe: Curry Chicken, Lamb Briyani rice, and samosas. Regular yoghurt drink.\n\nI was staring at the four girls two tables down from us, probably on their estrogen night out. Four Chinese girls, wanting to try something different..and somehow ended up here. I think it was the \"Fine Dining\" written on the sign outside that lured them in. It certainly was what got me. I don't appreciated being lied to.\n\nThe food came relatively fast, and the buttered chicken was served on a sizzling plate with onions that surprisingly wasn't burnt. It looked like a two chicken legs that got themselves a Jersey Shore tan. But maybe that's how all butter chicken looked, I certainly didn't know any better. Is it butter chicken, or buttered chicken? It says butter chicken on the menu, but that's just sounds like bad grammar. \nI don't know what rice Chris got, it was plain and flavourless. My Chicken Curry came in something that resembled a butter globe with the lid removed with a contraption that held the dollar store candle beneath it. It was anything but a generous portion. My Biryani rice however, was plentiful. The Chicken was dry, and I couldn't really taste the curry in the sauce. The evaporated onion & tomatoes in the sauce overwhelmed whatever spices used for the curry, and the base of the sauce was flat. The flaky sauce paired fine with my rice, but the dry chicken was what ruined it. My samosas didn't have any green peas inside...but that's like the best part of the samosa! In my opinion.\nThe butter(ed) chicken was not dry, but it wasn't tender either. I felt that everything lacked flavour. I didn't really notice the lamb in my rice until I remember I ordered lamb briyani rice. I suspect the curry here are made all with the same base. That's just not very Indian.\nI did however enjoy the sweeten yoghurt lassi. I had to suck pretty hard through their thin straw, but it was very good. I might turn this place into my bubble tea alternative. But really, sucking so hard on a straw for a glass filled with white stuff across the table from my straight male friend was uncomfortable. \nAt the end, we got this wet pastry ball for dessert, which was free. I have no idea what is was, but it was pretty good. The bill came out to $53....nothing Buddhist about that.\n\nSo with the food not being very exciting, I turned my attention back to the four girls. Why four...was it like Carry Bradshaw and her three friends? Like Sex & the City? They always met up in posh looking restaurants. So, maybe this was Sex & the City lost their jobs, moved to Toronto and started writing the relationship column for EYE. \nEYE doesn't exist now..so, that's two jokes in one...yeah? Funny right? I know..\n\n\nOh, you know how some restaurant hang rugs on the walls? This one actually framed it.......\n\nAGRA...NamaSHITay.
