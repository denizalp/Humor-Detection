The Modern Vegan is one of the best things to happen to the Las Vegas vegan community recently. I was smitten with TMV after I first perused its expansive menu. In the ~5 times I've been here, I've barely even made a dent in checking off menu items off my list. Thus far, I've been happy with 95% of the food I've tried. \n\nCORN DOGS ($11): This appetizer is a meal in itself since it comes with 4 giant corn dogs. Greasy perfection. 5\/5\nMAC & CHEESE SIDE ($5): Better than most vegan mac & cheeses I've tried, but not sure if it's omni approved. 3.5\/5\nGYRO ($14): The sauce and gyro plant-meat are amazing! But the pita bread is awful thick. 4\/5\nLOUISIANA FRIED CHICKEN ($15): My absolute favorite thing to eat here. My husband's too. The mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy are to die for. 5\/5\nV'EGGS BENNY ($15): Not my cup of tea. Not bad, but not great either. Too saucy. 3\/5\nTHE BUFFALO ($14): A buffalo chicken sandwich. Another winner. 5\/5\nOH MY GOD ($10): A chocolatey dessert. Good, but a small portion for the price. I wish the brownie was softer and warmer. The chocolate ice cream was awesome. 4\/5\nDRINKS: Expensive AF, so I stick to water. The downer here is that the glasses are teeny tiny and refills are usually hard to come by. \n\nAs you can see, there's a plethora of options to choose from at TMV. This restaurant is my go-to for meals with friends.\n\nYELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #17
