Review update: I decided to give Bulla another try last night. I walked in and was seated right away. There was no wait for drinks or food. The server was very friendly and extremely helpful with the menu. I ordered the red sangria which was so good and refreshing, perfect for a warm day.\n\nThe crispy calamari was not crispy. The flavor of the dipping sauce was good, though. It wasn't too bad. I also ordered the montaditos and the burger. The montaditos were pretty delicious. They come with four, which is plenty to share. It tasted like the beef was simmering all day in a perfect sauce. The burger was phenomenal. It was the best burger I had in a long time. I was blown away with the flavor!!!! I could've had two of them!!!\n\nIf you decide to visit here, I would 100% recommend the burger, you wont' be disappointed. My friend had the pork tenderloin, which was very good, but I still say burger all the way. I was happy with the service at my second visit. And I will be looking forward to coming back soon!
