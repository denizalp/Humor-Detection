I have had terrible experiences with hairdressers. The last cut I got was maybe 6 years ago, and I was dissapoint. So much so that I kept growing my hair and trimming it at home. \nStill, I've been collecting weird hair colours and hair ideas for years, and I wanted a big change. When I told her my idea, the girl who coloured my hair told me straight away to go to a barber, a friendly one who wouldn't mind serving a woman. A barber in the village seemed a shoe-in. I was referred to Tanya, who specializes in long hair. She insisted on meeting me beforehand to check-out what she would be working with, and booked an appointment 2 days later.\n\nThe place is teeny-tiny, but super friendly, they have a nice \"bar\" for you to chill at when waiting, and pump some electro jams worthy of Unity II. Tanya was a good conversationalist and seemed actually excited to do my cut. Bonus points! As a straight girl in a village barbershop, I was surprised by the warm welcome. No one batted an eyelash at me getting a \"dude\" cut, I was well-served, at a fair price, would love to be back!
