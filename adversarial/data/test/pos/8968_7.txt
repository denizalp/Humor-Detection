Not a bad spot on a Sunday afternoon. While not as overarchingly beautiful as it's Distillery District sister store, this Balzac's is definitely a lovely spot. Big windows, exposed brick, a charming antique tiled floor.\n\nNo wifi or outlets, so this more of a place to read or chat or mull over your own existence. It was delightful on a Sunday afternoon when I first went, but on night's when it's crowded it can be unbearable. Choose wisely.\n\nI recommend their brews over their espresso, especially the Balzac's Blend. Liberty Villagers should consider themselves lucky.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: ZAC'S a coffee maniac.\n\nMenu Readability: Yeah.\n\nNeed to mention: There's a parking lot across the street.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: No wifi makes me nutty\/needlessly existential.
