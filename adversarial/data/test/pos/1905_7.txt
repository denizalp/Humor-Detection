In the words of the late great Colonel Sanders - \"I'm to drunk... to taste this chicken.\"\n\nI don't like fried chicken to begin with, but sometimes I'm in a hurry and KFC buffalo sliders just sound delicious. To tell you the truth, they are delicious, and that is the only reason this shit hole is getting two stars. I've often gone here and the place is closed when they should be open, the dining area is over the top messy, and the people who work there have got to be the dumbest of the dumb. I understand it is fast food, but this is like the bottom of the barrel. They would be the dumbest of the kids with down syndrome.\n\nAnd they also have about 20 cats that live by the dumpster behind the restaurant. Poor kitties, having to eat KFC to stay alive.
