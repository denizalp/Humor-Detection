Minus one star ....when you make reservations and specify BALCONY.....you better get balcony! Well, after 20min of waiting for our balcony table, and a stern chat with the GM, we had comped drinks and our table.....but really? If I request something.....just give it to me.....or I'll complain until you do.....
