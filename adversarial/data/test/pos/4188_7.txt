I usually get my hair cut here. Despite being in Korea town, the staff is Japanese.\n\nThey are usually busy (good sign) but I can usually get a haircut without making an appointment by showing up and waiting a few mins. \n\nThe owner rules with an iron fist (although she is delightfully polite\/happy!) There are 4-5 female staff and 1 male stylist too.\n\nThe salon is pretty nice inside (and clean)  considering it is a low cost hair salon. (A wash, cut and style only cost me $28). I've showed up before just to have my bangs trimmed and they only charged $5. Very decent.\n\nPatrons are mostly asian but there are some whiteys like me who go. English is spoken, not great, but definitely enough to discuss\/understand what you want done with your hair.
