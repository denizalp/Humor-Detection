With over 2,000 reviews and a solid 4.5 star average, it's obvious that Mr Mamas is doing something right! I personally think this is one of if not THE best spot to have breakfast in town. It's not fine dining, just a casual diner with some delicious grub. \n\nI was a customer of the original Mr Mamas when they were located in a much smaller building on Decatur. The new location is so much nicer, but the word is out about this spot... there is almost always a wait to be seated. The employees here are efficent and get food out and tables cleared quickly.  \n\nService in general is just excellent... Mr Mama himself regularly stops by tables to see how people are doing, what a charming man he is! Every member of the staff I have interacted with has been friendly and I honestly feel like my patronage is appreciated when I eat here. \n\nStand outs on the menu for me are the Marty wrap, the french toast and I love their home fries. Don't skip the cinnamon roll, it's delicious.\n\nYelp Reviews 2018 30\/100
