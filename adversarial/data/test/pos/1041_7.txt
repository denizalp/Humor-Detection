Stopped in tonight for a doughnut on my way home. I really wanted some crullers or maple bars to dip in some milk when I get home. \n\nStood there for 10 minutes. While the winchells\/subway girls cackled in the back. Yes same girls different registers. Said hello a few times no response. Finally one came out I asked for 4 doughnuts paid and left. \n\nSeriously why don't they ever have crullers???? I ended up with some glazed doughnuts and the only maple they had was old fashion. Such a let down.
