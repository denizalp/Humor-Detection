After drooling over the photo of the beef noodles, I suggested this place to my friends for a weekend dinner. I was excited because the refillable noodles and I just wanted hearty broth!\n\nThe beef sirloin noodles (less spicy) came out pretty quickly after a few minutes and I was ready to dig in. I appreciated that the noodles and broth were both very hot and had an abundant amount of beef and it was delicious. I was too full to ask for and eat any more noodles. I'm also unsure if they handpull their noodles in house but it was still pretty good. The hard boiled egg was a bit powdery (what happens when you over cook it) but still good. Looking back at the photo, they display the noodles with bok choy but instead, they give you lettuce. So consistency is probably better.\n\nService was great, staff were super nice and checked up on us for noodle refills. Suggestions would to serve cold water with ice (especially on a hot summer day)!
