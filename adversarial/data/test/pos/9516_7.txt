So....  Where to begin. Let's start on the burgers as it is in the name of the restaurant. They were severely underwhelming. With an overall 4\/5 stars I expected at least mediocre. I was, if you didn't catch on yet, disappointed to say the least. The burger patties and seasoning was mediocre at best. I was asked if all the toppings including grilled onions were OK when ordering. Sure, I gleefully replied. Who doesn't like grilled onions? If you don't like them, stop reading your taste buds are broken anyway. Well grilled onions turns out to mean raw diced onions that just barely touched the grill. They were warmed, sort of, but still very much a raw onion. The buns were lacking and produced no memories good or bad. The burger had a very standard, fried burger flavor overall. On to the fries. Not much good to say about those either. More than half were greatly overcooked. Seasoning on them was also extremely inconsistent. Some had no salt, some were so salty I got instantly dehydrated and needed to have IV fluids. The other thing that bothered me (that's right you get more complaining) was the workers. I am all for skirting around my job functions and hanging out with friends but the location they decided to do this was strange. There was literally no one else in the restaurant besides my friend and I. The workers decided to hang out right in front of the drinks, ketchup, and pepper area and talk to each on on either side of the counter. I patiently waited until my burger was finished to get my fixings hoping they would move. They did not. I had to say excuse me while holding my tray to get ketchup. You couldn't pick a place to hang out that wasn't in the way? I mean seriously the entire restaurant was empty...  Needless to say at this point, I will not be going back. Two stars only because I did not get sick. \nWell at least not yet.
