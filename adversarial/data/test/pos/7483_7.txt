A beautiful mind can transform anything into beauty and the owner of Singh Farms is one of those beautiful minds. It's a work in progress but if you've been to his beautiful Singh Farms, you know that the finished product will be just as wonderful because anyone who can transform a plot of dirt off Thomas and the 101 into a secret garden can do anything. \n\nSingh Meadows is right behind Big Surf and right now, it's an adorable market filled with fresh produce and homemade honey, pastries, bread etc. It also has a cafe where you can order delicious food and juices. The meadow outside is a huge grass area overlooking a pond where kids can run while you snack on the treats. Right now it's a lovely place to visit on the weekend for breakfast and some locally made groceries and as time goes on, I can only imagine what this creative mind will create with this fresh canvas of green beauty.
