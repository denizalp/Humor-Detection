On the whole, I really enjoyed this place. The food was really good. The service was good...aside from our table being transferred to 3 different servers during our visit...but all 3 servers were good. My only true complaint is the fact that they allow children in the \"Yard\" area. This is the area to have a couple drinks & play a game of bags with friends...Not for your children to run around being obnoxious to adults looking to relax SANS KIDS!! Children in bars make me uncomfortable. PERIOD. It's not fair the majority of patrons have to suffer because a few refuse to get a babysitter or dine at a \"rugrat friendly\" establishment.
