BOUSTAN!!! If you ever mention this name to anyone from Montreal, they will have a smile on their place. The reason is this is the holy grail and go to place after a long night of partying. Hits the spot every time!\n\nSuper cheap and affordable. Expect a line up especially at 2-3 am! I always get the combo plate. It is just so fulfilling to stuff yourself with potatoes dripping of garlic and eating slices of well seasoned beef and chicken. Both choices of meat are extremely moist and tender. The portions are very generous and the service is great! All for under $10 as well!\n\nSECRET\/HIDDEN MENU:\nI don't know if many people know about this... but now that I am no longer in Montreal, I shall share with all of you a secret item that I found out from one of my best friends about this place. It is called \"The Creation!\" Order it and thank me later. I will keep it a surprise for you to find out!\n\nThis place is like a cherry on an ice cream - best and sweetest way to end the night. I will guarantee you that you will sleep like a baby after a long night out! Highly recommended!
