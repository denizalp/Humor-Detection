5 stars! Definitely 5 stars! I wish i could give them more.\nI now know that there are ITALIAN COOKIES close to Charlotte! And not just like a $15 variety pack like other places try to pass off. I'm talking 2 cases full of Italian cookies! Derado's is the only place in the south I have ever seen the set up. There are also cannolis, Italian deli meats, cheeses, 3lb sandwiches and so much more! Might as well call Derado's Heaven instead. Seriously. Then to top it all off, from the moment you walk in the owners treat you like a member of the family. Be prepared to spend a little bit of time sampling items and hearing about the delicious family recipes. It's an overall wonderful experience that's totally worth the drive a bit north of town.
