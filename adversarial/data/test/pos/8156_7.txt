With an average of 4.5 stars from 54 reviewers, how can you not try this place out? Having read about the hype, I decided to go find out myself. Of course, I ordered the renowned 'Spicy Mayan Chocolate' (One size). It was good, I've only ordered hot chocolate 2 times outside, because usually it's dissapointing or tastes gross. Weird. SO ANYWAY, yeah, too spicy for my throat. SORRY, GUYS! I'll try the non-spicy hot chocolate next time. Not bad, though. Definately not any hot chocolate I've ever tasted before with a pungent kick.\n\nPS: The atmoshphere was laid back with funky music that made you want to take off your clothes and swim in hot chocolate. (That's really the only way I can describe the music...)\n\n3.7
