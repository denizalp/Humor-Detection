How much wood can a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Well shiz. What didn't we order?\n\nWe started with oysters and sparkling wine. Some at the table started with their dark beer, campari and lemon twist cocktail. This sounds disgusting. It was actually quite good if you're a Bitter Betty. \n\nThen there were some whiskey and in-house root beer shots. They were totally tasty and unnecessary. We then got a whole whack of food. The gnocchi, steak and pork chops were all practically flawless. The tortiere was delicious, but we were all bummed it didn't come in one of the copper pots like the photos had suggested. Who doesn't love eating out of a pot? \n\nIn the end, I think we were all too full to think and quite drunk. Which made the extraordinarily high bill manageable. But the next morning when I looked at the receipt my jaw dropped a bit. A lot. I had to pick it up off the floor. \n\nPEPPER POINTS to our rad server, though she could likely calculate percentages, thus knew to be nice to us.
