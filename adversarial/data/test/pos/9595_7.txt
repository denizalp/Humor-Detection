Just moved to Vegas from the Bay Area.  I've decided to hit the neighborhood spots. To find Vega's hidden gems.  I saw some great reviews about Pop's Philly cheese steak.  I just knew it was going to be an great food experience.  Ordered the #9 and the chili cheese\n fries. As always when I have an negative review I never bash or criticize the food.  So since the mob was a great part of Vegas. I'm going to use an analogy from a great mobster movie. My experience turned out like Joe Pesci's experience did in the movie Goodfellas when they shot him in the head down in the basement. I just knew that Pop Philly cheesesteak was going to make me a made man. Instead I  got shot in the head and there was nothing I could do about it.
