Tryst is a great spot for breakfast\/brunch. I love their sweet potato tots, veggie omelets and thick applewood bacon. They also do a mean bloody mary and boast an amazing Organic Liquor section. I need to go back during the evening to check out their flavored vodkas.\n\nMy boyfriend has not been so lucky, he has had to send food back twice. The first time it was for a steak that was brought out bloody when he ordered it medium rare. The second time was ridiculous, he ordered eggs over hard and they came out runny, he sent them back and they came back BLACK. I didn't think it was possible to burn and egg like that.\n\nSo 3.5 stars for Tryst as long as you don't piss off the cook!
