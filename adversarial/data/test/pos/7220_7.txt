Call me a sucker for... \n\n1. Warm chocolate baked stuff with ozzy insides, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. The Chocolate Lava Cake.\n\n2. Friendly service welcoming and thanking you for being a customer.\n\n3. Small establishments that been around for a long time.  Surprisingly they've been around for at least a decade, I thought they were new. \n\n4. Variety. They have gelato, ice cream, churro, shakes, sundae, hot and cold drinks, waffle w\/ ice cream, pineapple upside down cake w\/ ice cream,  brownies w\/ ice cream, shaved snow, boba, ice cream cakes. And because of the business they share the same room fried food like wings and potatoes but they're technically another business since you pay separately. \n\nTheir gelatos and ice creams aren't up in the quality as AOF but none really are. They have variety chocolate mint, vanilla,  taro, black sesame, red velvet etc. And they also have an assortment of topping.\n\nMixers is located in the same parking lot as Taco Bell next to I believe a barber shop.I wouldn't have known it was here if it wasn't for that Groupon but would be back even without a Groupon. Definitely want to go back for more lava cake or maybe brownies with ice cream. They just remodeled, got rid of play area and added that fried food in place. It was clean, has a TV and music playing, and pretty reasonably priced.
