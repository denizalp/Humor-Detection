As soon as I walked in the door, I let out a big, happy sigh of relief. It was immediately warm and cozy from the heat of the pizza oven. I felt at home. A great refuge from the cold to hang out at before heading over to the Beachland ballroom for a show.  \n\nA local beer was in my hand in no time and the Cacio E Pepe pizza was ordered. Mozz, Pecorino, Stracciatella, garlic & black pepper. The dough and crust and everything about it was amazing! Mamma Mia! We ordered a Collinwood pie next and damn, son! Mozz, salami, It sausage, Cali olive, fresh green chilies and red onion all baked to perfection.\n\nThe staff was cool, the bathrooms were clean,  the ambiance was great, complete with a neat soundtrack. Glad to have discovered this pie joint. Soooo tasty! Can't wait to come back!
