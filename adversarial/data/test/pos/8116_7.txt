I think I'm going to buck the bad review trend here as I've been shopping here more often as of a recent focus on healthier eating and my experiences have all be very positive. \n\nA few years ago my wife and I tried to be ambitious and go healthy hard core and bough our entire weekly groceries here. We felt great about the decision, high-fiving our soon to be healthy meal plan filled with things like maca powder, chia seeds, rice malt syrup, vitamins, organic vegan eats and enough supplements to get Steve-o jacked like Rocky Balboa. \n\nThen the cashier gave us the $390+ total and we slowly pulled back our high five, handed over our credit card and argued about who made more silly purchases. It's your vegan protein powder that did it.... no no no, that's nothing compared to the 15 grains you bought. \n\nSo unless you're making Raptors player JV money, maybe not the best place to do an entire grocery shop. \n\nThat said, I've been following a rather strict meal plan the last few weeks, cooking 5 meals a day at home and some of the ingredients were \"niche\" to say the least.  It I knew Healthy Planet would have them, and they did. \n\nI think the smartest way to augment your healthy eating routine is buy the wallet busters like protein, produce etc from your regular store and come here for the specialty items to accent and augment your shop. \n\nThere's a few comments about staff being in knowledgeable but I'd politely disagree with that. Every time I have visited this location I skip the search and ask a staff member about where I can find this or that and ask them for an explanation on what it is and the benefits - and if I really need rice malt syrup or if pure maple syrup is fine. Anytime the staff either have the answer, ask a colleague to weigh in OR just this weekend the gal actually went and googled the info so she would know and so I felt comfortable with my purchase. \n\nI'd say that's an A+ in customer service in my books. Just smile and be polite and I think you'll receive the same in kind. \n\nOnly docking a star for their produce and overall higher price point BUT it's a specialty shop and you knew that walking in folks.
