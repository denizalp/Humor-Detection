There are two reasons why I love margaritaville and two only. \n\nThe first reason: Redbull margaritas. This is like the ultimate cure for a hangover AND you get to maintain drunkness. Fuck yes. If you sit there long enough and drink enough of them, suddenly you'll find yourself running down Las Vegas Boulevard at full speed against traffic with your shirt off and not remember a damn thing. Good times.\n\nSecond reason: rare burgers. You know, I get fucking completely tired of places cooking their burgers all the way through if I specifically ask for rare. I assume the risk that I might get ecoli or mad cow when I eat rare meat. Needless to say I'm stoked that margaritaville will oblige me and give me my fucking rare burger. \n\nThat's it. Just follow my lead and do it.
