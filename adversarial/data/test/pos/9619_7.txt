This review is not for the food, it's for the service.  I have not had a chance to review until now.  It was about 2 months ago on a Friday evening.  It had been a long week and my daughter and I wanted to grab a bit to eat and then browse the Borders next door.  I knew there would probably be a wait since it was Friday night.  We walked in and there we some other parties seated waiting.  I went up to the hostess and gave her my name.  I asked where the restrooms were and told her we were going to use them and we would be right back.  She said \"that's fine\" .  There was another party of 3 ahead of us, a mom and two children, that had been seated there when we walked in.  They came in the restroom too and we all came back out at the same time and sat down to wait.  They were seated about 5 minutes afterward.  I watched the hostess as she folded napkins and did other things at her station.  Another couple walked in and they were seated immediatly.  Then another mom and child walked in and were seated.  When the hostess came back I told her we had been waiting ang gave her my name again....this was at least 15 mins later.......and she said \"I called your name\" very rudely.  I told her we had been in the restroom (for not more than 5 mins) and she said \"oh well\".  And then she said well, I guess I can seat you now.  This girl was maybe 18 or 19, tall, thin, pretty, but certainly did not have the brains god gave her!  She was rude and clearly did NOT pay attention to her job.  She was too busy trying to look pretty.  \n\nThe rest of the experience was fine.  Our server was pleasant and fast. However, on the basis of that hostess.....stay away!  Management needs to keep a close eye on these kids.  They could take a lesson from the manager at Grimaldi's in Chandler.....that manager knows how to keep her staff in check and on the ball!\n\nI won't be going back to this particular CPK.
