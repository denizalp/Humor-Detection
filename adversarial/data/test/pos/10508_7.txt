Beginning with one fish & chips shop in Halifax, Battered Fish has expanded to a total of eight locations, including our very own T-dot.  \n\nIt's in a convenient enough location on Queen Street West.  Within a reasonably walkable distance from the Finance District, filling a gap where previously you'd have to take a streetcar on King to get to an actual fish & chips-specialty place or pay a boatload (if you're feeling punny).\n\nBattered Fish hits the mark for me in this regard: Starting at only $6 for a flat, hand-sized single piece of fish with a large scoop of fries on the side, I feel like it's a fair deal.  Choose your type of batter from original beer batter, crispy panko crust, breaded, or pan fried for a healthy option. \n\nI chose original beer batter for mine, while my friend had ordered two pieces: beer batter & panko crust.  The fish is a bit on the slim\/flat side and I feel like the batter could be lighter but this one wasn't bad.  I was told that the panko crust was much better, especially with wasabi mayo on the side.\n\nBy the way, you can choose one sauce, which comes in one of those mini, clear plastic cups the size of a loonie.  Coincidentally, if you'd like more than one, it will cost you $1.\n\nBattered Fish is a fast food joint where you order at the register, pay, then sit wherever there might be a free booth with plastic seating.  Utensils are dispensed via plastic homes that spit out one fork\/knife\/spoon at a time by pressing a lever on the side - seriously guys, those things are way more fun than it sounds.  Smart too, since it prevents from rummaging fingers and saves waste from individual cellophane packaging.  Press that lever.  Now press it again.  Awww, yissss. \n\nBy the way, at the same utensils and condiments counter, you'll find several different types of vinegar and two different brands of malt vinegar.  Nice. \n\nNo real service to speak of since it's fast food, but I did accidentally spill my fountain drink (~$2.65) and the cashier was quite nice about it. The lady at the register was also helpful in describing the batter types prior to ordering.  \n\nWhen it boils down to it, I'd still have to champion \"that place\" in Leaside for the fluffiest and flakiest fish & chips, but Battered Fish is a decent pick for a weekday work lunch and I expect to come back soon.  You might CATCH (heh heh heh) me there - I'll be the girl pressing out 100 plastic forks.
