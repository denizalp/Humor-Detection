A work colleague introduced me to the Brûlée Bakery on a nicely warm and sunny Saturday morning. We were walking down Electric Avenue, when she made a hard turn at an unmarked door and then hard left to downstairs. Upstairs was a cooking store and school, with the Metrovino Wine Shop farther through. She knows of this place as she lives in this general area and the next door spa she goes to serves Brûlée Bakery goods to their customers.. Her first reaction when I started asking for details of this place was \"Don't write this place up on Yelp!\"\n\nToo Late, as the secret of this wonderful little bakery is already out. I ordered a pecan roll that was the best warm and sweet piece of baked goodness that I had enjoyed in a very long time. And if actually lived in Calgary, I would be back often for the breads and the various tempting examples of Le Gâteau Élégant.  I was so impressed that later in the afternoon, I circled back by myself and snagged a few breakfast scones for the next day and after. It was all good to the very last crumb.
