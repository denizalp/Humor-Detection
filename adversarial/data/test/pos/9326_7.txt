I absolutely LOVE the Farm at South Mountain, especially during the Springtime! It is my go-to spot to bring guests for breakfast or lunch when they are visiting AZ. Beyond just eating here, there is so much to see! From their gardens, to their animals, to their cute shops and cafes, it is the perfect spot to relax on a sunny AZ afternoon with good friends and family. It is SUPER pet friendly and a great place for kiddos to run free. \n\nI love their smaller cafe where you order at the counter and they call your number. I pretty much always get their chicken salad sandwich and a tropical black iced tea. They also have delicious salads with homemade dressings, fresh fruit, and the baked goods are out of this world! \n\nI've also heard that it is a gorgeous wedding venue! I know that i'll be back again soon!
