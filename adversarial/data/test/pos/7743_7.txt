We finally got to check out Rai Lay Saturday night while out with dinner with some friends.\n\nSuper cute location in South End. We arrived around 8pm and were able to snag a table for our group. Most of us stuck with a Sapporo to drink.\n\nI ordered the spicy tuna roll and the edamame and my husband got the drunken noodles. The drunken noodles were delish! I know my husband likes it a bit spicier but I thought the spice level was perfect for me. My spicy tuna roll was about average but the edamame was fantastic. They put this seasoning on top that gave it an awesome flavor and kick. \n\nService was great throughout the whole evening. Great meal and cute spot.
