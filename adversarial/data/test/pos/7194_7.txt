Great New Place, right across, just a few yards from original Store which is Now All Western Work wear and Boots.This New Store is much Bigger, better, spacious and has Everything. Nice big area to get your Hat cleaned and shaped, they do a Great job cleaning Hats. Picked up some Shirts and jeans, New Boots, Belts & Buckles. Staff always friendly,and plenty of sales persons working, just don't know why you always have to hunt them down to help you and to get a dressing room Unlocked. Keep them Unlocked and stay with customers, last visit they lost a big sale,I kept waiting for someone to unlock dressing room door, so I could try on some wranglers,and nobody showed, so we walked out without a Purchase. Have to look for the sales, and salesperson. it's pricey. Great Deals on Boots, their Sale Items Excellent, Most times. We Buy alot of product and Boots and there is No sales person, Always Have to Hunt them down. It's Pricey, so look for the sales, act like an educated NYer, Look for the deals.
