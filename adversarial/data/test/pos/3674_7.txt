The current star rating of 3.5 stars is incredibly accurate of Mineo's.  I'm going to be unpopular and round up to 4 stars because I think Mineo's is a more unique pizza than other places in Pittsburgh.  You're going to be indifferent or love it.  I'm confused about my emotions, clearly.\n\nDisclaimer:  I did not order a pie here, only two slices.\n\nMineo's crust is unique.  It's thin but not like cheap Pizza Hut burnt-to-a-crisp-thin pizza.  It's almost like the dough doesn't rise the whole way or something, but it worked for me.  The sauce was ok, not too special.  But I love cheese, and this pizza was swimming in cheese.  It was pretty fast for my two slices to come out, and at $1.70\/slice, not terribly priced.\n\nI actually had really friendly service while I was there so I'm not sure about those complaints.  The tables were a little dirty and some weirdos were sitting inside.  Not pizza items were super slow, but it's not a huge kitchen.  I wasn't totally shocked by that.  I would come back here for a few slices on a laid-back night.\n\nCash Only
