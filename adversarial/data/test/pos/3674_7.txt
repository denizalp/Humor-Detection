NEVER A DULL MOMENT! Door guys were funny and courteous. Greeted by Elmo and Tigger. Then welcomed in by a Bearded Lady. PeeWee showed us were to get Tequila. Then we dropped it like it was hot with Snoop. Went blow to blow with Sly Stallone. Spoke French to Johnny Depp. Ate the Cookie Monster's Face. Saw a killer magic show. Ate chocolate from an Oompa Loompa. Versace Versace'd with Barney. And Motorboated the lady with the largest boosoms this side of the Mississippi! Amazing Time! Don't miss it!
