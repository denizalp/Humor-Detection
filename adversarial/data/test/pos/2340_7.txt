Love love LOVE that they have a second location in Summerlin.\n\nThis space is beautiful. It's a Yelper and Instagrammers dream location! So many incredible photo ops.\n\nSwooped in on a busy Sunday morning to grab some java to go. Ordered the Honey Vanilla Latte with almond milk from the lovely gentleman behind the coffee bar. Pro-tip, you can pass by the host stand and walk right up to the counter behind it. There you can place your order and wait on the comfy couch for them to call your name. \n\nAlthough the man behind the coffee beans was quick, I did think that it would be more efficient if they ran that coffee bar with three people. One taking orders, one prepping the cups, one person on the bar. I noticed the host was missing quite often too. This place is popping and it may run more efficiently up front if they had a host taking names and another host to escort guests to their table. That way, the host stand is never left unattended. Just my two cents.\n\nMy coffee was delicious. Nice and hot. Creamy and sweet. A nice little Sunday treat.
