You can smell of the sizzling fajitas from outside of the restaurant.  I have stopped by around 12PM expecting a very long line, but it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I had ordered 1 pound of top sirloin and 1 pound of beef fajitas.  I figured that might not be enough to feed 4, so added a super quesadillas.   The fajitas were juicy, savory, and accompanied with handmade tortillas.  They have a pretty impressive salsa bar.   A huge selection of flavorful salsa's range of spice levels, fresh guacamole, large jalapenos, and salted fishes.  The chips were very good, freshly made and warm.   I had waited at least 25 minutes before getting my order.  I definitly will call ahead next time.
