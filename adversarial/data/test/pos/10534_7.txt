This doctor is a complete crook. Not only was she late to the appt, she did NOTHING. my primary dr refered me here after an abnormal pap. She looks at me, spends 5 minutes telling me I have nothing to worry about (the primary dr said my cells could be cancerous) then goes on and on about how she's going to a funeral! Talk about unprofessional!!! So I got no pap, nothing but a BILL FOR 100! I wasted my insurance here. I have none left. I don't understand why I had to pay to listen to her talk about going to a funeral. I thought this appt was about my body? DO NOT GO HERE SHES SO UNPROFESSIONAL. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER OBS IN THE VALLEY WHO ARE MORE ATTENTIVE. CROOKS!!\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!
