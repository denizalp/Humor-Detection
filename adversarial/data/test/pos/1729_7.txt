Why 2 stars? Because it's one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI used to eat at a local Mongolian grill very often in high school, and I was pretty excited to be reunited with one during my layover in Charlotte.\n\nI can excuse the fact that my order was forgotten, and I had to wait much longer than everyone else around me... mistakes happen. What I cannot understand is how they can, in good conscience, serve the Mongo BBQ bowl. Honestly, it's one of the worst tasting things I have had in a very long time.\n\nI can't imagine the President of Genghis Grill visiting this location, tasting this dish, and saying, \"yep... that's the Genghis way!\"\n\nI mean, it was just awful. Even if I don't like something, I usually end up finishing the whole thing, because I'm a human garbage can... but I couldn't stomach finishing this.
