This place has pretty good pork tacos, but it's a bit on the pricey side.\n\nSpeaking of side, the sides that they serve you with the meals are lacking. Wish you could get your money's worth out of this place.\n\nI think if I was really craving mexi food I'd come back here, but due to it's price to proportion ratio, it's not some place I'd frequently visit.
