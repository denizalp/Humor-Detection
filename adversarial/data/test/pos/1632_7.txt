I walked in today with my girlfriend to buy some Wiz Khalifa papers and as she and I were leaving the manager, whom I have never met before in my life outside of this store, told me that if I ever harrass any of her employees, specifically one named \"Ellie\", whom I have never met before in my life, again (implying I'd harassed her previously, which I find to be absurd) that I would be banned from the store for life. Her accusation was that I had said something to her in a class we took together (which is false). Her accusation had nothing to do with her job at all!\n\nFirstly, I find this personal line of conversation to be very inappropriate at a well-founded establishment, which caused me great embarrassment in front of my girlfriend as I was being accused forthright for actions that I had (A) never done before and (B) felt were uncalled for in such a public area.\n\nTo verbally attack a customer on any such grounds is horrible customer service and wildly innapropriate for any establishment, but doing so on behalf of another person is even more innapropriate. If that person has an issue with me then let them take it up with me. This was the manager herself doing this, which showed me even more how unprofessional an establishment Puff 'n' Stuff truly is.\n\nBanned for life or not, I refuse to even set foot back in this place which has publically embarrassed me so. I personally feel this manager, whom wears glasses and has long red hair, should be fired for such descriminatory conduct which made me feel extremely singled out.
