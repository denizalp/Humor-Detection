I waited on this review for the past few months so I could make sure that the repairs that I paid for, actually stood up over the miles I put on. It did. So, here's my reasons for the mediocre review ...\n\nCustomer service was lacking. As I explained the issues I wanted investigated, it was as if his attention was elsewhere. One the quote documentation, because of his inattention, he had to redo the paperwork to include several of the issues he neglected to remember. \n\nWhen I came to pick up my car - no one went over the repairs with me which was noted on the survey the cashier asked me to complete. She said that wasn't good however, she didn't follow up and ask the service staff to go over it with me after the fact. \n\nIn their defense, I'm pretty handy and techie and I can read a receipt - so I wasn't pushing to have someone go over what I could see on the bill and I was going to put the work to the test by driving it anyway. \n\nThis all being said - the repairs were as promised - probably a little more than what a non-dealer would have charged but my car is running like a champ and that's all that matters to me. \n\nLastly - no follow up as of this review. The dealer I normally take my car to in CA follows up like they actually care. That does hold some weight with me.
