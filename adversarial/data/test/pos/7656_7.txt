I went to the Oakmont Tavern last night to visit with some high school chums and see a crack, cracklin' Motley Crue tribute band. Rest assured, this is most certainly not a dive.\n\nWhen you order a chicken salad at a dive, that is if they even have chicken salad, it doesn't look like a culinary grad made it. \n\nMy lovely ladyfriend picked for me, as I just couldn't make up my mind. Her finger landed on the Pub Chicken Salad, and it was magnifique! Red onion, crumbled bits of blue cheese, mandarin oranges, walnuts, and raisins adorned the gigantic plate. The poppyseed dressing was a creamy, tangy opiate, and the grilled chicken breast was tender and slightly charred. Notice I mentioned the chicken last, as the salad was so good, you almost didn't need any meat in it, and I barely finished it. Yes, a salad filled the belly of this 200 lb. muscled workingman. \n\nI also had the Loaded Baked Potato since I cannot pass on any hot spud made by someone other than me. You get two toppings. I went with sour cream and chili. Aside from the plate being too small, I have no complaints. It was monster, a headbanger's side dish, fluffy, with a chili that had a corned beef hash quality to it. Memories of Parkway Center Mall's Potato Patch filled my grey matter. In my opinion, a restaurant baked potato should be akin to an ice cream sundae, rich, creamy, and topped with things you don't have everyday. It should be as gaudy as it is gratifying. If Baskin Robbins added a lunch and dinner menu, The Oakmont Tavern's Loaded Baked Potato would be on it. \n\nThe live band playing that night was Dr. Feelgood, a tribute to everyone's favorite Kings of LA Sleaze. Professionals through and through, the band played expertly amidst arena quality lights and fog. My only complaint regards the location of the band set-up; it was in a corner of the bar not easily viewable and partially obscured by pillars.  Could a better space be made for the bands to play in?  \n\nThat minor caveat aside, I urge you to go there and have a good time.  It's posh sans the upscale prices, the service is terrific, the people are fun, and their brand of barfood  will please any bon viviant. Pardon the smoke and loud music though. It's essentially Gullifty's run by rockers, so perhaps I'm a little biased. Hey, they're my people y'know?
