Vegans, lend me your ears.  I discovered today that the taco stand in front of Reyna's offers two types of vegan tacos!  Yes, I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the word \"vegan\" on the menu.  Of course I ordered myself a carnitas burrito and my gf the black bean taco (also included rice, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro).   My gf could not stop raving about the flavorful beans and refreshing toppings.  She even hates cilantro but found herself liking Reyna's cilantro.  The other vegan option is SOYRIZO!  Yes, you heard me!  I was in shock when my gf mentioned \"That bean taco was so good I don't even want to try the soyrizo.  Just give me more of those beans!\"  So there you have it.  Even if you're not  a big bean fan, taco fan, or fan of the strip district - this taco stand is worth the trip.\n\nPrice is either $3\/taco or $5\/2 tacos.  Cash only.\n\nOn a side note, my carnitas taco was also really flavorful.  I can't wait to go back and try the other meats they offer.
