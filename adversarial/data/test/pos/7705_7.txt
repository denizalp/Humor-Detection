I love coming here, to get away from the heat of Vegas. Yes, it can get really hot here, but sometimes a few degrees cooler makes a difference to me. Lol. I love taking my dogs out here. When I'm here, I feel like I'm not in Vegas any more, which is a good thing. There really isn't much to do in Vegas other than gamble, drink, party, etc., so it's a nice change to just be in the wilderness and be one with Mother Nature. Haha the dogs love frolicking around and letting the inner coyote out. Great for the whole family and great exercise while your at it. They have many trails for different levels of expertise. If you are lucky, you will be able to see a tortoise and big horn sheep! To all you selfie picture takers, it's a great spot to do that here! So come on down!!! Take a picture, frolick, skip, hop, roll down the hill (not advised, may cause death or severe damage to All bodily parts due to cactus) and let's all get together and do that scene from sound of music!!
