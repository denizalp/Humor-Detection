We were in between breakfast and lunch so we ordered French onion soup, lobster benedict, and waffles with fresn strawberries.\n\nAtmosphere was lovely.\nService was good.\nFood was so so.\n\nThe French onion soup had way too much bread which basically soaked up the soup and left us with an entire crock pot of mush.  The cheese was melted perfectly on top and was deliciously savory but did not make up for the pile of mush beneath it.\n\nThe eggs benedict was pretty good, but it certainly wasn't the best we had tasted.  They were trying to be creative by serving a mini waffle under the poached egg insted of an English muffin, but the mini waffle did not have a good bite to it like an English muffin would have thus there wasn't a great contrast of texture with the egg.  \n\nThe lobster was cut into small pieces and sprinkled around the plate.  There was also bacon cut into small pieces too and sprinkled around the plate.  The saltiness of the bacon and the lobster surprisingly went well together and did not clash.  I wonder if it would have been better without the bacon, as the lobster flavor would really sand out.  Perhaps, adding some sliced avocado in place of bacon might be a good flavor pairing although typical.  \n\nThe waffles were crispy and yum. We asked if we could have both the whip cream and butter on the side, but they brought it with the whip cream on top and the butter on the side...it's like...HELLO...what part of BOTH do you not get?\n\nAnyway, our waitress was attentive and the hostesses were very nice.  Although I might have preferred going to the buffet for breakfast for around the same price as my eggs benedict!!!  \n\nBut the line is 2-3x longer!!  In Vegas, if you're NOT a VIP, be prepared to wait in line!
