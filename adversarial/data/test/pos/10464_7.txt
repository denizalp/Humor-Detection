I'm going to be real here, I'm unimpressed by this place. \n\nFirst of all, it is not Hawaiian. Let's just get that out of the way now. Half of the menu consists of tacos! Wasabi is a common ingredient. The standard side dish is coleslaw, when everyone knows in Hawaii its macaroni salad. Let us all just agree to call this some a pan Polynesian\/Pan Pacific\/Southwestern \/American fusion restaurant. Yeah, I find that confusing too. \n\nOur first trip to Hula's was unexpected. We were walking from our friend's home to Maizie's and decided we should just pop into Hula's on the way. If you are taking the LR I would suggest getting off at the Campbell stop, but I think its 6 of one, 1\/2 dozen of the other between that and Camelback. If you are driving they have a huge parking lot. \n\nThe initial visit was 4 days after they opened and we had some hits and misses with the food. I really enjoyed the fish ceviche, while my husband did not as he does not usually like fish ceviche. The shrimp rolls were a huge hit. I thought that the hapu was adequate, as was the mahi mahi. Our friend ordered a steak which was one of the grossest, grizzliest steaks I have ever seen. We left that night wanting to try it again, so we made reservations for a group of friends for my husband's birthday the following week. \n\nUpon our return we tried the tuna poke which was fantastic and the pulled pork sandwich which was poor, IMO. My kalua pork is a million times better. On the first visit we had tried the sweet potato fries and they were pretty lackluster so we tried the plantains the second time around. The fried plantains were some of the most disgusting things that I have been served at a restaurant in a long time. I was hoping for fried plantains in chip form but they were hunks of plantains. Plantains as a non fried fruit are not really all that great, there is a reason why they are always served cooked in some way. By not splitting them up into smaller pieces the starchy flavor is overpowering. As far as food is concerned I feel that you have to really try different things to find their strengths. \n\nAs far as drinks are concerned, get the Absolut Boston with lemonade. Thank me later. I have a PhD in mai tais and I will tell you that these are just average. They are entirely too sweet and the dark rum was not floating on the top, but rather it was shaken with the light rum like you would shake a martini. That is not the proper way to make a mai tai. We ordered a few volcano bowls for my husband's birthday and while they were strong, they were also very sweet. Tropical drinks don't have to be sweet! I really want a Tropical Itch or a Lava Flow but to be honest I'm not sure they offer them. \n\nService is hit or miss. On his birthday my husband was wearing a birthday hat and our server actually asked him- in what I believe was complete seriousness- if it was his birthday. What? Really? \n\nThe indoor space is great, not such a fan of the lighting on the patio. I think I will probably be back for that adult Arnold Palmer and apps. At the time we were there they didn't have a happy hour, but they have added one now.
