Thank heavens for Kahane Law Office!\n\nI received an offer on the sale of my condo, that had a weeks' turnaround time to the close.  I was a little concerned about finding the services I needed to help make this deal go through on such a tight timeline.\n\nKahane Law Office stepped up and make it happen. \n\nThey came highly recommended to me, and they did not disappoint. \n\nI spoke to the office at 3:30 on a Wednesday, and I had an appointment to sign the paperwork at 11 a.m. the next day. \n\nThe deal went through without a hitch.\n\nIts always refreshing to deal with such a high level of customer service when the pressure is on.  I will not hesitate to recommend this law firm to anyone.
