Urban...2 bedroom loft, stainless steel appliances, great layout for room, large rooms, minutes from the Biltmore, Wild Game Sports Bar, and shopping, etc., awesome pool area, (small gym), and you have the ingredients for a great place to live! The leasing and maintenance staff are friendly and motivated to take care of you! We've been here less than a month and we dig it!  (Did I mention it's quiet?))
