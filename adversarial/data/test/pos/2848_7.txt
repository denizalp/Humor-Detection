Had dinner with my husband, first time at Kazuki sushi... Had all you can eat. Food was ok , I had better for the price. Service was slow like they don't want you to eat too much. So order everything you want at once otherwise you will be waiting awhile  in between orders or have more beer and you won't realize your still waiting. Gave it a try and won't be going back.
