A groupon brought us in and I'm SO glad it did!!! We started out with a pitcher of the house margaritas and carne asada nachos. The margaritas were so good and the nachos were to die for. For our entree we shared a taco sampler with a fish taco, pastor and asada. Let me say that I'm from SOCAL and I know my Mexican food, Agave is authentic and delicious loved the whole meal. \n\nA special shout out to our server, Larissa, she was the best server we have had...ever!!!! Attentive, fun and not pushy or always coming around. We don't get to Vegas often....luckily we are headed back in December and we can't wait to visit Agave again. Management, if you have an employee recognition program Larissa is the best out there and made our dining experience wonderful, treat her well!!
