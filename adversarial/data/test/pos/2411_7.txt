I wanted to write about all the delicious sandwiches I ate here.  But now, I don't remember the sandwiches I got.  Maybe it was because we came here 3 times in the wee hours of the night.  Or morning.  But mostly night.\n\nI know I ate here 3 times and all 3 times I thought to myself that the sandwiches are delicious and that I must write a good review.\n\nSorry.  I forgot what I ate.  But it was still delicious.
