Derell is a great server and took good care of us.  Chef john is so kind as well as skilled. He always makes great suggestions that I love every time. He offered the trout from the Specials menu.  I love salmon, so the trout was good for me. The pop rocks are a nice touch!  Chef also sent over peppers and edemame to start, can't go wrong!  I like the salmon tostada ($1 during happy hour!) Kumamoto oysters for $3 each. Very clean tasting and nicely garnished with tobiko. The finale... Nice suggestion by our server white peach sake. Served in a nice carafe over ice (I posted a photo). Sweet and refreshing. The food is excellent and we always feel so welcomed!
