Just scroll down and read Jackie S.'s review.  I experienced the same service.  There's just better places to go for sushi; don't waste your time with this one.\n\nIt's on a lame and fast street corner, too, and the view \/ activity is non-existent.\n\nYou've got better things to do than sushi @ Pearl...\n\nSeriously.
