The Chandelier: the best bar in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Chandelier: home to the most talented mixologists in Las Vegas.\n\nPeriod.\n\nIn a city full of avaricious club owners who will happily extort a $50 cover out of you in exchange for the \"honor\" of paying yet an additional $20 for a mediocre vodka tonic in sterile nightclub surroundings, the Chandelier is like a beacon of hope -- hope that excellent customer service and superlative mixology aren't entirely dead in the Las Vegas nightlife scene.\n\nThe Chandelier is gorgeous and delicious -- and unpretentious.  No obnoxious bouncers, cover charges, or waiting lines here.  \n\nThe Chandelier is a multi-story work of art.  Spanning the first three levels of the Cosmopolitan, the Chandelier will make your jaw drop when you walk in.  You're surrounded by veritable waterfalls of crystal and glass, with lots of beautifully appointed bar counters and swanky lounge tables.\n\nWhen the two of us sat down at the first-floor bar, the charming bartender didn't skip a beat.  He informed me that there was no menu, and he'll make me any drink that I want.  I was ecstatic.  I asked for a fun and fruity gin-based drink.  He smiled, and prepared what he called a Misty Rose -- an amazing concoction with more ingredients than I can recall.  It had gin, Pimm's #1, St. Germain, apple juice, fresh herbs and spices, bitters, a few other things -- and strawberry marmalade.  Yes -- marmalade.  The marmalade gave the cocktail a rich and creamy consistency, which was completely different from anything I've ever had before.  The cocktail was ginormous, and more than enough to last me the entire evening.\n\n... All this for $12.  Even in San Diego, many spots will charge you more than that for a medium-quality drink.  No Las Vegas up-charge at the Chandelier, miraculously enough.\n\nThe rest of the Strip can keep its tourist trap bars.  Next time I want to booze it up in Las Vegas, I'm making a beeline directly to the Chandelier to enjoy some craft cocktails in a stunning setting.  It doesn't get better than this.
