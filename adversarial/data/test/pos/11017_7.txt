I remember when this place opened.\n\nI got the whole rundown from the franchise owner.\n\nIt's a Canadian operation that deliverers on healthy options in a sandwich\/wrap shop.\n\nI have a fun story about this particular location though.  \n\nI came in for lunch and was about to order when the staff took one look at me and all the mexicans ran out the back door.  The owner was obviously not working the store anymore.  \n\nThe manager-guy was like \"OH HI THERE!  HO HO HO!  PRETTY FUNNY, EH?\"\n\nHe was freaking out pretty hard.\n\nI realized that I was wearing a polo shirt that read \"INS.\"  Now it didn't stand for immigration, but the people working the grill didn't stick around to find out what I was about.\n\nThe manager bribed me with cookies for my silence... until now!\n\nThe food was better when a MBA was cooking.  Now it's just a bunch of dudes who slop stuff into a pita instead of a burger bun.\n\nIt's pretty hard to screw up falafel though, so give that a try if you want some veggie options.
