IKEA has the potential to make me believe in a higher power.  Not for the reasons you may think however.  If you believe in a higher power you must also believe in his counterpart and IKEA's store is proof he exists.  \n\nDon't get me wrong I love a lot of the items they sell and I'm happy that I can get them without having to pay shipping.  But the layout of the store is beyond irritating.  They force you to look at every item in the store just to get to the part you want to, everyone walks at a ridiculously slow pace completely ignorant of your desire to walk faster.  And the check out lines are so slow.   I'm bet Walmart goes there to learn how to slow people down even more.\n\n\nIt's highly likely I'll be back here, begrudgingly.
