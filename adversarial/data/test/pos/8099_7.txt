Got my first tattoo here several years ago as a Vegas tourist. I had a general idea of what I wanted, but no specific design. When I went into the shop, I found a piece of flash on the wall and Johnny went to work. I was happy with it then, but now know that the quality wasn't great.\n\nNot sure if Johnny phoned it in since I was just a tourist getting some shitty flash tattooed or if his skills just aren't up to par... Either way, I wouldn't go back. There are too many great artists in Vegas to risk another mediocre tattoo (which I have now had covered up).
