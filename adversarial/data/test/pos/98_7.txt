I heard it was good.  And it is. Thank. God.  Tukee deserves a neighborhood restaurant that knows what it's doing.  And it doesn't hurt to have a place to go for a cocktail that's within walking distance.\n\nI went with my girls dining group and everyone really enjoyed it.  The decor is comfortable and slightly upscale.  The huge patio doors were open to create an indoor-outdoor patio feel and the weather was perfect.  We had a drink at the bar first and the bartender, Eric, was hell bent on making sure we picked a wine we liked.  We felt genuinely welcome by everyone. \n\nBetween the 5 of us little piggies we had the lavash pizza, calamari, halibut, chopped salad, pappardelle w\/ragu, hamburger w\/fries and a poached pear dessert.  The pizza was huge and crispy and perfect - large enough to share between 2 or 3 for a meal and it's a great value at only $9.  The calamari was hand cut, hand dipped, thick and crunchy.  The alaskan halibut was flaky, served hot with homemade mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The pappardelle noodles were a bit wider than I'm used to, but they were obviously made from scratch because they were stretchy and yummy chewy.  The ragu was really good - I would usually spice mine up at home with some red pepper flakes so it seemed a little bit bland, but it was completely authentic.  And the portion was very generous.  They also brought out a block of thick parmesan to shave over the top.  Right then I was convinced that they knew what they were doing.  I didn't taste the burger or the chopped salad but they looked great.  The burger was huge and the thick-cut fries were hand cut and crispy.  \n\nAt the end of the meal we split a poached pear with housemade vanilla bean ice cream and limoncello drizzle.  Crazy good.  \n\nThe best part of the night was when the owner came out and told us about how he got started, what's going on with the sign out front - more like the lack of sign out front (you'll have to ask him), and where he gets his organic produce, meats and fresh ideas.   \n\nCan't wait to go back to try the mussels, angel hair w\/mushrooms, pork tenderloin, diver scallops, more wine and  live music.
