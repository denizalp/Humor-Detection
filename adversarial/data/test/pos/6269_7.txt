If you want to try many dishes, All You Can Eat Menu (AYCE)  is for you. The portions are smaller and not all the items from regular menu are included but you get the idea if Spring Rolls is for you or not. As for me - I probbaly won't come back.\nThe service was good, even though noone cared if we liked the food or not. We had to send back couple of dishes and noone asked what was wrong, why we did not like it.\nDishes that I liked:\nSweet potato fries were really good, mixed with kimchi (delicious), cheese and mayo. Full of calories but great dish.\nMango salad and Wonton soup were good. Chicken with ginger and broccoli was very flavourful, as well. And I really liked their Spicy Ginger Tea with Honey, even though I have to admit it was way too sweet for my taste. And boy, it really is spicy. But it is not easy to find a place with interesting, unique teas (I'm getting tired or regular green or black teas that most restaurants offer).\nAs for the dishes that I did not like:\nPad Thai Noodles were so-so. I usually love Pad Thai (PF Changs or most Thai restaurants offer delicious Pad Thai, but this one was a dissaster). I actually sent it back to the kitchen. I think it was the type of noodles they used that I did not like. I am not sure, it just didn't feel right. (They still charged me for the dish, even though I sent it back).\nLots of fried dishes, bright red coloring for some chicken dishes, including the Pad Thai I mentioned. There was a dish with beef \"on a bed of spinach\" - but there was no spinach (from AYCE menu). The manager explained that this dish does not come with spinach. Hmmm, okay.. so why is it called \"on a bed of spinach\"?\nI was looking forward to try their desserts but it was dissapointing.\nPumpkin Creme Brule came very watery and small. I was wondering if its a mini version from AYCE menu but no, it was actual size and costs $5. My friend had the same dessert and she did not like it either. It was just very sugary and watery.\nI also tried their Mini Mousse.. but was not impressed again. I wonder if I'm way too picky or the food is just very average.\nNote: If you go as a group and only one person wants to order from AYCE menu - it is not possible. The manager explained that everybody has to order AYCE at the table. That is just ridiculous! So should he\/she sit at the table next to us, alone?!
