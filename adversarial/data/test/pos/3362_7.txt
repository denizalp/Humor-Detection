I buy my cat food here and the staff is super knowledgeable and friendly. They have a large variety of natural products and are nearby my folks. \n\nHave been meaning to review them for a while & then saw the personal attack on Jennifer that I felt was extremely suspect and IMHO unwarranted. \n\nAdditionally to purchasing kitty products here, I do quite a bit of dog sitting and have purchased outfits (don't judge, my gf's Toy Pom has Alopecia) nice selection and again, super helpful.\n\nAn example of above and beyond customer service comes to mind 2 years ago when I was doggy sitting for the Poms while their CSAR Air Force family were in town for the funeral of their best friend at Nellis. Their Mama had been at Bethesda holding the hand of their best friend for a month until he passed from injuries sustained attempting a rescue in Afghanistan. Both pups were in dire need of a grooming with no notice. My go to spot & this place were both booked solid. They were so moved by the story that both found room for the girls. Only timing made me choose another spot. \n\nDue to years of patronage and never experiencing even a sideways glance...I feel secure in suggesting this as a fine spot to patronize and entrust the tummies and fur of your four legged family members to. Without a doubt.
