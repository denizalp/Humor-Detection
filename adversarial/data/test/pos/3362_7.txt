This is a nice hole-in-the-wall vegan spot that is open later than most restaurants in the area. \n\nAbsolutely love the tacos with quinoa and black beans, as well as their nachos! + their Thai tea with hazelnut is amazing!\n\nTheir staff is super welcoming. It kinda scared me at first because people aren't usually that nice, but these folks are pretty cool.
