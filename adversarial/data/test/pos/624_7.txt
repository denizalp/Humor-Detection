I should have know better then to come here. I live close to here and there was just something that I didn't like about this place. I couldn't tell you why or what but I just wasn't feeling this place. Granted you don't see an Urgent Care and walk around telling people \"I want to try that place one day\" but in an urgent situation this would not be my first choice even though I live literally 2 minutes away. I usually go to Fast Med which is about 1.8 miles but they had already closed.\n\nAnyway...It was about 20 minutes to closing and I had no other choice to give this place a try and see what it was about. The lady at the front counter...RUDE. Need I say no more. No smile, no welcome in, no nothing. Just a sense that she was annoyed that I came 20 minutes before closing. She didn't even bother to make eye contact with me. Just gave me paperwork to fill out and asked for my ID and drivers license. \n\nAfter I finished filling out my paperwork the nurse came to the door and just stood there. Didn't say a name and was just staring like we could read his mind that he was ready to take the next patient. I assumed it was us since we were the only ones in the lobby and proceeded to the door. My baby is screaming her head off and he is moving in slow motion. We get to a room and he starts taking her vitals. He starts counting on his fingers trying to figure out her blood pressure..WTF he takes like 5 minutes trying to figure out what number he need to put down. He goes to take her temperature and he can't get the probe cover out of the box. By this time I'm fed up but then the doctor walks in. She goes through her routine and tells me the medicine she is prescribing will make her feel better by the morning. That was definitely a misstatement. My daughter was actually worse off after taking this medicine and cried most of the day. I had to end up taking her to another urgent care and I told the doc what the previous urgent care told me about her feeling better. She politely told me that they should have never told me that and gave me a real explanation as to why she was feeling the way she was. They gave me a different prescription and I could already tell it was working better for her. \n \nThe only good thing I can say about this place is I was in and out pretty quick but the staff and level of service I received was not a very good experience. I will gladly drive further down the road then to ever come to this place again.
