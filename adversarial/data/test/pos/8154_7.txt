2018 YELP CHALLENGE: 68\/100\n\n3.5\n\nMore like PRICEY Mexican-inspired Latin fusion! Incredibly festive yet relaxing atmosphere. We luckily got a reservation on Mother's Day\/Graduation weekend Saturday night (which is kind of odd). Again, expensive, but the portions are good and it was such a relaxing experience.\n\nQuick Tips:\n-GROUPON.\n-Mostly OUTDOOR patio, but they do have a private dining room (great for groups, family outings, and date night!)\n-Bad cell reception.. but who's on their phone at dinner? ;)\n-Live music 7pm-9pm that changes nightly! A Mariachi band proceeded the Live Music (wish we came later!). Check their website for a Live Music schedule.\n-They share a tight parking lot with the Ballet Boutique, but there's street parking and another restaurant's lot next door..\n-Only ONE bathroom for each gender. It's a wait on a busy night.\n-Skip the cornbread. \n\nTaste\n\nTour of Fuego ($16.25) 3.5\/5\nA crispy empanada (4\/5) with ground beef (supposed to be pernil?), a salmon croquette (4\/5), a spicy veggie tostada (3\/5), and a cubano slider (4\/5). The MANGO SALSA on top of the empanada was delightful! Tostada was NOT spicy. It was meat, pico de gallo, and guac. The croquette was doused in a light butter sauce and the salmon resonated throughout! Cubano slider was good. This appetizer was hard to split among 5 people.\n\nFuego House Salad ($11.25) 4\/5\nMixed greens, black beans, corn salsa, 1\/2 an avocado, pico de gallo, candied walnut, tomato, and tortilla strips with an onion vinaigrette. I think it would have been better if the avocado was sliced in thin slices or cubed instead of two 1\/4 pieces, but the cinnamon spiced walnut was really good. Not overly dressed. Simple, somewhat substantial salad. Expensive for no protein.\n\nCoconut Shrimp Martini ($15.25) 3\/5\nAbout 6 huge battered prawns nestled with pickled red cabbage in a martini glass. Fun presentation! Well seasoned and sweet. Worth the price? ehhh.\n\nShort Rib Enchiladas ($28) 4\/5\nI split this dish, and half was the perfect portion. Entrees get 2 sides, so I got the Cornbread (2\/5) and Black Beans (3\/5). Cornbread was like baked mac n cheese. Supposed to taste like green chile, but I didn't get a hint of it. Black beans were a little watery, but good. Not enough cilantro. Short Rib enchiladas were topped with very complex mole. LOVED IT. All entrees (except the Surf and Turf) come with a side of pickled cabbage, which gave a lot of contrast of texture to our dishes.\n\nSurf and Turf ($30.50) 4.5\/5\nA huge piece of steak and a massive amount of penne and veggies. We had asked for the steak to be cooked Medium Rare and it came out PERFECTLY. The sauce, however, was just a creamy sauce (the green chile flavor was too subtle). Yes, this was worth it, even though it did NOT come with sides.\n\nPork Medallions ($26.50) 3.5\/5\nMore like chorizo stuffed rolled pork, but it was delicious. About 5 slices of pork rolls (like sushi) were smothered in a heavy creamy sauce. Good, but again, the red chile was too subtle. We got green beans and black beans for the sides. Nothing special about the green beans (3\/5) and the black beans were a little watery (3\/5)\n\nKey Lime Pie ($10.25) 3\/5\nWAY WAY too expensive for a slice of pie NOT a la mode. The good thing, the key lime is not subtle!! Maybe too much key lime. Coffee is necessary to cut the key lime. Ice cream would have brought balance to the force.\n\nPrice 3\/5\nThe reason why we didn't LOVE it. \n\nService 3\/5\nHe checked up on us only at the end. But he was sweet. Shout out to the wonderful busser who kept our waters full!\n\nCome for the vibe and share plates (which are much more expensive than most tapas). I really recommend the Short Rib Enchiladas and Surf N Turf Pasta.
