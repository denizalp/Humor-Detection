Probably the worst Walmart I've been to. Do not use them for oil changes. Some kid at the register tried to rip me off 48 cents and I had to talk him through using a calculator to do subtraction because he honestly had no idea. Effin' idiot! Plus there is a lady there in a wheel chair who will most of the time stare at you and tell you to hold on, then go chat with her co-workers. I hate this place!
