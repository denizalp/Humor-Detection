WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP CLUB THIS IS!!\n\nWe were given bracelets to get in for free for Jermaine Dupri's party here. WHY did we actually think this was legit???  My first sign should have been the guy chasing myself and my cousin down the strip begging us to go in and promising us a table and a bottle.  WOW what a lie!  \n\nWhen we got there, the line was very long and the extremely pretentious doorman was not letting ANYONE in!  My cousin finally jumped the line (she has more nerve than me lol) to ask what is the issue and that we had bracelets to get in.  He told us the bracelets were worthless and were not valid for entry.  He said he would let us in if we paid him $10 each and we said well, what about our bottle? He literally LAUGHED at us. I was so annoyed and kind of embarrassed.  I didn't even want to go in.  I don't think I've ever had such an experience at a club before EVER. And I have been to a lot of good ones back in NYC.  We decided for the experience, we would just go and check it out.  Douchebag Central! In fact, it was literally full of FEMALES. There were barely any men and the ones that were in there were..you guessed it..douchebags. See this doesn't surprise me since it was the doorman picking and choosing who was going to be going in or not.  I was in there for about 15 minutes before I was ready to go.  I'd much rather hang out at a nice hotel bar or lounge. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!
