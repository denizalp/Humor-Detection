Rude, abrupt employees.  On July 10, 2014, I received poor customer service.  I called the store and asked to speak to the manager.  He would not be in until after 2 pm, I was told.  I asked for his name.  At that point, the phone disconnected.  I called later in the day, and in a flippant way, I was told the manager was not in.  No wonder the employees are rude.  They lack adequate supervision.  Merchandise and gasoline are overpriced as well.  Stay away.
