Stars: 4\n\nPros: Excellent barbershop.\n\nI have been going here for the past year and every time, I am quite content with the haircut. \n\nThe service is prompt (it requires either online or phone reservation). However, the first time I went in, I didnt know about this. Yet, they were nice enough to immediately schedule me in. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes. \n\nAlex (who owns Quintana's I believe) is extremely friendly and actually remembered me the next time I visited. He always strikes up a conversation. The person who mainly cuts my hair is Theo. Does a good job and takes care to make sure its the way I want it. Clips on back and scissors on top. Plus, they always provide a straight razor shave.\n\nFor women, they have manicures and pedicures upstairs.... dont know too much about that stuff, haha.\n\nAll this for $20. \n\n\nCons: \nI do have to make comparisons especially with the National chain Hair Cuttery, which also washes your hair (in addition to the normal cut). All that is for LESS than $20. \n\nAs cheap as cleveland gets for many things, it seems that the prices for barber shops are more expensive than even Boston!
