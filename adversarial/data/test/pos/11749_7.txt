Burt's Bistro is a bookstore and artisan gift shop that serves food, wine and also part time musical entertainment. This business is affiliated with Benvilla the charitable organization that provides a variety of services including care, funds and support for the elderly, the disabled, children and families.\n\nI had the Baja Grilled Chicken Salad. The chicken was tasty but not technically perfect. My salad was also missing many of the ingredients the menu listed but overall was ok.\n\nMy husband tried the Steak Quesadilla. It was filled with a generous amount of steak that was undeveloped with flavor. \n\nOur server was very attentive and good natured.\n\nAll the books for sale are only $1.00 each
