This review is only for the beer, AND i only tasted one of their many beers so take this review with a grain of salt, it's a very narrow review.  I'll be back to try more beers and update when i visit next time.\n\nI've stayed at Main Street Station many times over the years, eaten at their buffets, gambled for hours many times but never tried their brewery.  As long as i can remember, even when i turned 21 there was a brewery in this hotel and casino but i was never really into beers until a few years ago when the whole micro brew scene took off.  So i finally have sort of a taste for what styles of beer i like and don't like.\n\nWhile walking outside the casino, i saw signs for $2.50 craft micro brews from their brewery on the Casino bar.  I had never noticed where the bar on the casino floor was because i always got free drinks while gambling.  I found the casino bar just to the left of the buffet.  Im not sure what they charge in the actual Micro brewery and Restaurant, but it was closed at the time and $2.50 sounds like a great deal to me.\n\nI ordered the Black Chip Porter ($2.50) it came in a plastic cup, I'm not sure what they charge in the actual Brewery\/Restaurant or the size that you get in the restaurant vs the casino floor.  I took a few sips and i wasn't too impressed with it, i just didn't care for the flavor.  I like dark beers, porters, stouts and dark ales, but i just didn't care for this one.  I actually ended up tossing it out after drinking about a third of it.  With that said I'd still come back and try their other beers, the Pale ale, hefeweizen, and their High Roller gold light beer look promising.  So although i didn't like their porter, i still have high hopes for their other beers, which i'll try on my next visit.
