Came in on St.Patrick's Day after the Flogging Molly concert and smooth jazz music is on??!! Big. Fat. Fail. We had to ask them to put it on something different (How about some irish drinking music, it's St Patty's Day for pete's sake!) and it took the manager\/bartender forever to get around to it. It looks like it was just somebody's ipad plugged into the system playing Pandora. On a side note, our female bartender was flipping awesome and knew a LOT of scotches.
