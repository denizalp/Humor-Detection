It was 3am & my hubby wanted food. He said let's go to McDonald's & I said ugh whatever. As we are about to pull up to the drive thru I spot Federico's & say let's go there instead! I ordered a quesadilla with sour cream & my hubby ordered the same with a carne asada burrito also, oh & 2 Dr. Peppers too. The quesadillas were huge & pretty good but so damn greasy, we both felt like shit the next afternoon. I split the burrito with him for lunch the next day & it was pretty good as well. We'd definitely return if we're drunk & hungry!
