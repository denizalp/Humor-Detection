I saw this place had a Groupon so I hopped on Yelp to look at the reviews.  Since they were positive I decided to buy it because the reviewers made me really excited about this place.  What a bust!  I will say that whenever I am excited about a restaurant and I see low reviews, I generally think those people are babies.  It's them that I should have listened too.  And here goes one of the whiners...\n\nThe area of town and the outside of the restaurant prompted my wife to comment that she 'felt like she was in another city'.  I thought to myself 'exactly the reason this place is going to be so great'.  Inside was the same story.  The decor was so odd and unflattering that I thought again to myself,'this place is going to be great'!  The sauce all over my menu just sealed it for me.  Greatness!  What I'm trying to say is that if you have 20 or so reviews and you still have 4 stars then I will overlook all of this garbage because you MUST have great food.\n\nAfter three different people took different orders from us we ended up with our house salad.  Greatest salad ever?  Nope.  The salad had to be from a bag and it was covered (COVERED!) in ranch dressing.  To top it off there was about an inch of water covering the bottom of the bowl.  (I made sure to post a pic of it.)  Gross.  We couldn't even eat it and I was starving!  When they took the salad bowls away they asked why we hadn't eaten it...oh wait, I was dreaming.  They didn't even acknowledge the fact that the salad was untouched.  Then the food came out and I was staring at some round piece of food that was supposed to be a Chile Relleno (Picture).  I have had a number of Chile Rellenos in my day and none of them have ever been round.  I will spare you all the drama to say it was the worst Chile Relleno I've ever eaten.  The sauce was so odd that I couldn't even gag it down.  My wife's enchiladas were also pretty bland\/bad.  \n\nI truly cannot even believe this place has 4 stars.  This was the most disappointed I have been in a long time.  I was so excited about this place and I thought it would be a great, hidden place to tell my friends about.  Amigos Cantina at Fiesta Henderson is waaaaay better and they don't have 4 stars.  Come on!
