I've been in here twice and each time my service was ok and food good and fresh. It appears they're understaffed. We walked in to many open tables but had to wait 2 be seated. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating. It took the food quite some time to arrive, but we hadn't ordered 200 wings so I don't know what was going on in the kitchen. Food was fresh and hot. I'd definitely return and hope they hire more staff.
