My boyfriend has been to the location in Carlsbad several times, and during his last visit in Vegas, he suggested that we come here for dinner because he knows how much I love seafood even though he's not a big fan himself.\n\nTucked away in the District at Green Valley Ranch, King's Fish House offers dishes for seafood lovers and non-seafood lovers alike. We walked into the restaurant and I was immediately blown away by the interior design. The ceiling, the light fixtures, the tile... Gorgeous! Yes, I pay attention to these kind of details. Overall, the atmosphere was wonderful and perfect for a dinner date. \n\nN'awlin's BBQ Shrimp- Okay, you MUST order this if you're a fan of shrimp! Absolutely delicious! The shrimp is saut√©ed in a spicy almost broth-like sauce and served with toasted sour dough bread for dipping. The perfect appetizer to share! \n\nLemon-Nut Crusted Wild Mexican White Sea Bass- Now say that 10 times fast! The cut of fish was perfect. Not too big, not too small, and breaded just right! It was served with lemon butter sauce and a choice of two sides. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the mashed potatoes were some of the best we've had at any restaurant! Garlicky and really full of flavor! \n\nHerbed Chicken Breast- My boyfriend enjoyed his meal! The portion was huge because the chicken breast took up almost all of the room on the dish! I tried the chicken with the au jus. It was moist and flavorful! He ordered the sweet buttered corn as one of his sides and O M G... BEST corn I've ever had! It was super fresh and extremely sweet! I love the fact that the corn was shaved off of the cob and not individual kernels like most restaurants.\n\nI truly enjoyed my first experience at King's Fish House and I am looking forward to dining here again in the future. Thank you to our amazing server Lacy for taking care of us! She was really attentive and sweet!
