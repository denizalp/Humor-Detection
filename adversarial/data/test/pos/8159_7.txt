One of my favorite places to eat in Kensington market. I had a very delicious vegetarian sandwich for $6. Grilled eggplants and bell peppers with cheese. I had a Philly cheese steak in past, and it was pretty decent for $7. \nIn the evenings they serve pitchers of Amber Larger or Amsterdam blonde for only $10. They also make margarita, sangria, and tequila sunrise.
