Same as the previous review.  I went there today to find that it was no longer working.\nI also found someone explaining the people that no one knew anything about Roy Thomas or the building or nothing at all... more than now we were able to go to Wynn Fitness.\n\nSo far I am trying to contact the people at Wynn to cancel my membership and see if I can get some of the money I paid in advance back, but I doubt it will happen.\n\nIt is a shame since it was a good place
