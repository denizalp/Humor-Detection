Still one of the best dayclubs in Vegas, but here are some notes from my experiences here:\n\nDayclub\n- Free on guestlist before 11:30AM for men, and 1PM for ladies, however the main DJ doesn't come on until 3:30-4PM, so if you don't like waiting around listening to repetitive house music for hours, it's probably more worth it to just pay general admission and come closer to when the DJ comes on\n-Cheapest table option is a lily pad which is about $2000 including gratuity\n-Don't forget to wear sunscreen or you will get burnt!\n-Beer starts at $14, liquor starts at $20\n\nNightclub\n-Don't assume EBC at Night is the same as nightswim, we found that out the hard way; EBC at Night means its just a regular nightclub and the pool is closed off, if the title of the event includes Nightswim in it online, then it's a pool party (we got confused because our promoter called it nightswim so we showed up in casual clothes)\n-Girls usually get drink tickets which can be used for vodka or champagne until 12:30AM\n-Very limited dancing space
