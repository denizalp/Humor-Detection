Fremont Street is definitely different from the Strip. The light show is entertaining, especially if you were, say on LSD, or just on the verge of throwing up.  It's overhead so you get to experience an awkward sense of community and relativity with every other drunk person around you simultaneously looking straight up and it takes up the entire street.\n\nAs for \"crazies\", my friend and I got chased down by guys with cameras asking us if they could take pictures of us. One of them followed me into a store and while I was looking at a side of keychains, actually stood there in the aisle long enough to try and snap a picture. Which reminds me, I need to go check the strip next time I'm down to see if I'm on one of those sex hotline cards.\n\nAside from that, there are casinos, buffets, carts welding typical Las Vegas propaganda, bright lights, crowds of people, carts serving alcohol, bars, fried oreos and bananas, a Starbucks, $1 shrimp cocktails (!) and a psychic.\n\nThat psychic's no good. I went there with 7 friends, about 5 of us went to see her, and only obvious bits of our lives were true. I'm still trying to find a good psychic like some girls seek out the perfect manicurist.\n\nOne old lady in a wheelchair wheeled herself alongside my guy friends trying to warn them about something and when they crossed the street to get away from her she started swearing at them.\n\nChippendale's had some dancers there and we took pictures with them. They just threw us in the air and held us like babies. There was a motorcycle show where three guys on three motorcycles got in a cage and rode around in circles.\n\nIt's fun, it's cute. Everyone should see the light show sometime.
