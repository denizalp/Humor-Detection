Absolutely the best tiki drinks I've had, and that includes local SF Bay favorites like the Conga Lounge, Kona Club, Tonga Room, and Forbidden Island, and places on Oahu.  Although one drink on Oahu in particular might be in the same league.  The bartender\/owner is serious.  I mean, 80 different kinds of rum serious.  You'll marvel at the selection of rums and liqueurs here.\n\nWe came on a hot afternoon, and were almost scared off by the someone having some sort of fit around the corner.  I think he was on some sort of non-tiki-related drugs, but in the back of my head I thought \"if this is what these drinks are gonna do, I might be in trouble.\"  We walked into an air conditioned tiki paradise and sat down with some older locals for a drink.  They were having beers, and we learned later on in our trip (at Palomino) that it used to be a regular dive bar and some of the regular patrons still go there.  Great people, though.  One of the best parts of Vegas is the people you meet off the strip at amazing places like this, Double Down, Palomino, etc.\n\nI had a Green Gasser followed by a Fink Bomb.  The Gasser will wake you up and get you going, and the Fink Bomb will lure you in with sweet coconut rum and pineapple juice and then hit you with a hurt bomb like one of Tyson's legendary '80s knockout blows.  They rate their drinks in skulls, and if you're driving, weigh about 175, and have a reasonable tolerance, you don't want to go over 10 skulls, trust me.\n\nGuys, take my advice and don't go through the bathroom door that has a skull with clearly defined cheekbones on it.  It's so dark inside that you won't notice that the skull has lipstick on until it's too late.  And by then you're committed, because the whole bar may be watching.  You would think that the strong cheekbones were for men, but go to the left.\n\nOne of the must-stop places on any Vegas trip if you want off-the-strip fun, along with Double Down and Hash House a Go Go.
