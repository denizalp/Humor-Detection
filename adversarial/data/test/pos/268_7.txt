Pretty disappointed, to be honest. Came here on an 85 degree day to enjoy dinner outside and instead had to sit upstairs in the freezing cold with every fan going on top of the a\/c because of a \"buyout\" downstairs and outside. I couldn't see my meal because it was so dark, and I'm now pretty sure there were little oranges in it, which I'm allergic to, based on how I'm feeling. (they weren't mentioned in this menu item.) It was also crazy loud. Bummed I came here for my last night in town
