I am upgrading IP to 4 stars.  I have now figured out the Rockhouse and since I am almost never in my room I shouldn't complain about it.  Now keep in mind that this is 4\/5 stars for what it tries to be, and IP doesn't try very hard.\n\nOh, one more warning.  Unplug your phone.  Some jacka** was calling my room at 5am and hanging up.  Oh no you dinint..
