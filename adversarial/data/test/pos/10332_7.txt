Came here for lunch one day. I was excited because well, I love tacos! And a guy from work was bragging about the quesadilla he had from here. So we walked here and got seated in a booth for two, there were 3 of us so we were all bumping elbows the entire time. The place was empty because it was raining. Like 5 other tables being used. I ordered 3 tacos, 2 beef one chicken and the chips and salsa. Chips and salsa were amazing! I'm talking amazing! But that was the only thing pleasant about this trip. My tacos came out and they were wrong. I ordered no sour cream, they came with sour cream. Plus they gave me 3 beef. I asked the girl if it was all beef and she goes \"oh no, it's the seasoning.\" Um chicken is white, not dark like beef.\" So she rolled her eyes and brought me out another one. This one was actually chicken. I didn't care much for the seasoning on these tacos. However the beef was way better than the chicken. I loved the toppings that were on it. My friends knowing I wasn't happy, or full, gave me some of their quesadilla. Oh my! That was awesome!! They were perfect, not dry just awesome. Then came time for our bill. The girl mixed up my bill with my friend. At that point I was just ticked, so she gave me the cash difference for hers and called it a day so we could get out of there. I was disappointed. The only saving grace for this visit was the quesadilla and the chips and salsa. \n\nA tip, if your fluffy and one of your friends is as well, ask for a bigger table so your not squished in a smaller one. They are fluffy people friendly, as long as your seated properly for the right amount of people. \n\nThe place was clean, tables not sticky and chairs were cleaned and wiped down properly.
