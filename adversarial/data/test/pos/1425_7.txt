As an admitted Sandwich junkie, I visit Subway often.  They seem to have a location everywhere.  I visit this particular one quite often.  \n\nMy standard order is a 12\" BMT on Italian Herbs & Cheese Bread, toasted, w\/Mustard, Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Salt, Pepper, Oregano, Oil, Vinegar.....got that?  Well, these Sandwich Artists do a good job every time I order it, as you can see for yourself.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/subway-scottsdale-14?select=aEFSPkyfHftB16ESUS76nw#aEFSPkyfHftB16ESUS76nw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/subway-scottsdale-14?select=70D3UjgOPAW1AtLmbym4rw#70D3UjgOPAW1AtLmbym4rw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/subway-scottsdale-14?select=EWZM7xwzBejjWRvNLS8XXQ#EWZM7xwzBejjWRvNLS8XXQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/subway-scottsdale-14?select=2-WpztOYeCkcB565agJFog#2-WpztOYeCkcB565agJFog\n\nThis place can get pretty busy at lunch time, so I'll sneak in around 11:30 to beat the rush.\n\nIf you're in the area, I recommend dropping by this joint for a quick Sammy.\n\nReturn Factor - 88%
