Monday night drinks with Jim B.. total chill place, great service, great owners. If you have questions about the beers, just ask the owner. He was very knowledgeable and enjoyed talking about them. \n\nThey appear to cater to bikers of all kinds, street, cruisers and HD types, but did not mind a couple of new faces. \n\nThe food looks killer and the prices are right on. There is a pool table, free pnuts and tvs. \n\nCheck out the Local Brewery tasting days too. I think it was Wednesdays.
