Very poor customer service. I wish i could give them zero.\nOur friends recommended this place. We decided to have dinner here. We called before we go there. Nobody even bothered to pick up the phone.\nWe were there 45 minutes before their close time. They said they are closing the kitchen and they wouldn't serve us. We insisted since we drove from Virginia but they didn't even respond and shut door on us! I guess she didn't care!
