Come for the Garlic knots and complimentary antipasto plate...they are the best things offered here.\nThe location is great (next to movie theatre) and I can see why it would be a goto spot in Downtown Summerlin. The patio seating with live lounge music is a nice place to hang out during the weekend...make sure to place reservations. The singer will politely ask for your favorite songs but then play her own lol...it's her thing :)\nA bottle of wine and great service from Sam and Daniel, the manager, plus the Garlic knots make this place worth revisiting.\nThe food is lackluster and overpriced but TR's crowd doesn't seem to mind.\n\nChicken Marsala, Veal Piccata  - Both very pedestrian. I think these dishes cater to the older crowd that doesn't like bold flavors but enjoys shuffle board. It reminded me of something I might get at a buffet. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend TR to anyone that wants good Italian food or knows how to cook. But if you want ambiance and don't mind making a meal out of the Garlic knots, then this is your place!
