I went in for a couple quick items i needed, could not find the beans, the tall girl showed me, and saw me looking for other things, and did not continue to help. She was more interested in her co worker (short curly haired guy)behind the counter.  I went to pay for my beans, and asked her why she did not help me anymore and she said she was talking to her coworker, he \"just got in\" and  because she did not like my attitude regarding the beans. The short curly haired guy said his boss would support whatever they do, (he was obviously trying to impress the tall girl)  It is a shame because usually i get pretty good service in there. This time the two working were both rude to me, AND there was hardly ANY PRODUCE at all. the stuff they had was old wilted and brown.
