Came here after a night of drinking and it totally hit the spot.  I got the small sized Pho Ga and it was too much for me.  The air conditioning blasting outside was a super plus because it was like 105 degrees outside and no one wants to eat Pho in that weather but you have to when you are hungover!!!
