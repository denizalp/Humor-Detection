I've been eagerly anticipating this place's opening as they'd been building. The thought of a unique, modern and upscale restaurant in Brampton was exciting enough; however having one only a stone's throw from my place (well, if Jose Bautista was throwing) only built up the anticipation that much more.\n\nI finally made it in today and was floored by how gorgeous and spacious the place is. It's modern decor with quite a bit of flair, and the place could probably fit 100 people. Very friendly and attentive staff to greet and service us throughout the meal.\n\nI was with the little guy, and figured the safest thing to do would be order pizza for him. The pizzas on the menu are all around the $15 range, but when I described that he just wanted pepperoni and they figured it was just for him, they said they had a kids one. It's not on the menu, but a great option to have, especially since it's 1\/2 the price of the pizzas on the menu. Not the cheapest item you'll find for kids if you compare to other places; but a fair price since it's still great quality and cooked in a wood-fired oven. He loved it naturally.\n\nI went for \"Backyard Special\" burger which is essentially a standard burger with cheddar. That said, all of the ingredients are premium, from the brioche bun, mixed greens and fresh angus patty. That quality was evident in the tasting and even the cheese really stood out. There was a great house-made relish on the side which was nice. I went for the house salad, and glad I did since it was made with top quality greens, as well as roasted peppers with cheddar in a subtle chilli vinaigrette. \n\nIt's only my first visit; however I can confidently say this place is primed to be the best restaurant in town in almost every respect. Moreover, J Red and Co. would stack up against virtually any comparable place in the GTA. I'm so glad there's finally a place like this locally. Now it's up to others - Bramptonians in particular - to discover this place for themselves and celebrate something that's been lacking for so long until now.
