1st visit..I asked \"what are you known for?\" Response \"our chili\".....\nShould ask more probing questions like is it known for being good?\nWarning- everything comes with chili on it except this one burger (California Classic). \n\nThis isn't what I would consider chili. It's not that it tasted bad, it just didn't taste real good. It reminds me of the insides of those burritos you can get at gas stations...you know the ones...when you drink or hungover they hit the spot, but sober you avoid them... It's that stuff.
