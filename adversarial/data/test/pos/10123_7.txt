Had a good experience from start to finish. Went for my first ever eye exam! since they had a $10 promotion going on and my insurance doesn't cover for it. Since I've never had to deal with eye issues, I don't have anything to compare this to, but I will say that if I have concerns down the road, I'm coming to this place. I booked my appt online- it was very easy to make, cancel and reschedule. I was taken in at my appt time, everything was explained in advance, no surprises. The staff was friendly and professional. Explaining the extras was done appropriately and I didn't feel they were being pushy. They have a large selection of frames, scored on another promo. As soon as people walked in, they were being helped. There's ample parking, and if you have to wait for a prescription, there's the rest of the waterfront shops and eateries to pass the time.
