My rating is based on this first review... not on the second.\n\nOn my first visit to Z Tejas, I went at lunchtime with 2 guys from Boeing.  We had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded.  As I scanned the menu, the Grilled Green Chile Pork Enchiladas with green chile sauce and a tomato-avocado chopped salad caught my eye... and I'm glad it did.\n\nI dont necessarily consider myself an 'enchilada' type of guy, but this dish provided me with the best I've ever tasted.  I recommend this dish, with no reservations.\n\nNow for my second review.\n\nMy boss and I headed to Z Tejas today.  I figured that I'd mix it up and try something new.  Bad choice.\n\nI was feeling a bit famished, so I ordered the more expensive menu item, which was Jack's Five-Cheese Macaroni Achiote.  The grilled chicken with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses and bacon gratin sounded like a complete winner.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nThe dish incorporates real cheese, which I would normally find appetizing.  However, in this case, the entree was served piping hot, causing the cheese to string everywhere.  Kind of messy for a lunchtime meal.  \n\nSo, I ate slow, in hopes that the threadlike curd would solidify some.  Well, it did, but it also left, what can only be depicted as an oily scramble, in the bottom of the bowl, due to separation.  Delectable!\n\nWell, I decided to ease up on the 'roni, and move on to the chicken, which was served with skin on.  Visually, the skin looked crispy... but I realized my peepers were punked when I chewed up on some rubbery epidermis.\n\nSwoop Says: skip the mac 'n cheeze, go for the whole enchilada!\n\n\nIn other news, the server at the bar was top notch.  She refilled my palmer again and again, until my bladder shouted: 'Uncle!'.  When you need some pampering, saddle up to the bar.\n\nBIRTHDAY BONUS: Signup for their birthday club and get an annual $10 coupon in your email.\n\n~Swoop
