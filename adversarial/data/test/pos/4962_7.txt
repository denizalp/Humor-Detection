Just came here today for lunch because friends are recommending this place and let me say,this place deserves more than 5 stars!! Quality meat products and they also serve appetizers as part of all you can eat! Awesome!!! Everything was good esp the marinated premium steak which our server Jaenica suggested. She is awesome she knows whats up! And very very nice customer service like she really cares that we enjoy our first time here! Definitely would go back here and ask for her! Thanks Gen!!
