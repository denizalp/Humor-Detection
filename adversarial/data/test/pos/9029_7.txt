Killer kabab joint at the corner of Bay and Gerrard. Recently opened in June 2010, this place outshines other hawkers of Halal. For starters, it looks like a million bucks with tumbled marble tiling, hardwood floors and lots of natural light. It's not often one can comment positively on the aesthetics of a shwarma place, but with two floors and plenty of seating, it's actually a respectable spot to relax and have lunch.  \n\nI ordered the chicken pita for $5. It was steaming hot and loaded with fresh ingredients, but nothing spectacular.  But I will give it points for being structurally sound; my hands were not sopping wet afterward, a fate I have befallen after many a failed pita.\n\nI only found out after I went that their mini-pizzas are the way to go. I'll have to try these next time I'm there.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: KaBAB's your uncle.\n\nMenu Readability: Wisely, they avoided the Obligatory Bad Pictures of Shwarma and went for the standard overhead fast food menu.\n\nNeed to mention: They have a small patio upstairs and a shisha for use. For real?\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Nothing makes me madder than when a pita falls apart on me.  NOTHING!
