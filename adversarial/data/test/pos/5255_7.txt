One of the rudest and nastiest persons I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with!  I called after hours last night and this guy tells me \" I should have not answered the phone, call us when the business is open\". I also told him briefly what my issue may be with my electric dryer and I used the word \"replace\" instead of \"repair \" and he states \" if your read the ad again etc\". I left an email and he acknowledged it just this morning ---he says\" yeah, we got the email and we have men working , so why don't you use 123 Plumbing !  What an absolute shit head!!  I told him I was a sinlge woman and needed some help. If this is the way you are treated , look elswhere. Monny Bounds---if you are the guy I spoke to earlier, you need a serious attitude adjustment.
