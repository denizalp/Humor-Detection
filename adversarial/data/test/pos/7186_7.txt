Oh sandwiches, how do I love thee?\n\nThere isn't a great deal of selection at Myrhe's Deli, but man can they make a mean sandwich. Earlier this year, I stopped in for a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich and ordered it to go. It took a few minutes to make it, but then it was packed into a sturdy little box with the coleslaw, some chips and a pickle. I ate it in the park right across the street. It made for a lovely summer lunch!\n\nMore recently, I stopped in for a Pesto Chicken sandwich. Also delicious, and also served with coleslaw, some chips and a pickle. There's no messing around with the coleslaw either. It's crisp, it's fresh, it's sprinkled with pepper and not slathered in creamy dressing, but rather in a delightful more Italian tasting dressing. Mmm!\n\nStop in for a sandwich, or order yourself a whole pound of Montreal Smoked Meat and make your own!
