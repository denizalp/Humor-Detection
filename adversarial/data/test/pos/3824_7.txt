I h8 dis place. Place haz no water or electricity. It's day 27 and I've gathered enough fire wood from the front lobby to keep a fire going for at least 7 more hours. I've ordered solar powered energy pads that run off of me using 8 hamster wheels so my phone will consistently sit at a solid 8% or it'll go down and be at a steady 7 if I'm streaming something from Netflix. Brb. Will finish review later. I have to grab my flint rocks for my fire.
