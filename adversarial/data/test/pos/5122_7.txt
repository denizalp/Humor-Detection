I've now been twice for lunch and once for dinner with a friend. The place is spotless. Most of the seating is booths along 3 walls. In the center are a couple of square tables and a few round tables seating 6 with lazy susans in the center. The owner pretty much runs the front of the house with help in the evening. He was training a helper at lunch my last visit.\n\nNow to the really important part, the food! For lunch specials I have had Moo Goo chicken and chicken in garlic sauce. They came with a small salad, an egg roll, soup of the day and your choice of white or fried rice. Both were cooked tasty and filling. For dinner we had chicken with broccoli off the regular menu and chicken casserole off the white menu. As an appetizer we had spicy dumplings in chili sauce which was very good. I think I would order solely off the white menu for dinner. Not that there was anything wrong with the regular menu but there is so much tasty territory to check out in the white menu.\n\nOverall a very good addition to the West Valley.
