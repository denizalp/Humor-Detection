Thank you Gordon Ramsey Steak for giving us a superb dinning experience. You have set the bar very high.\n\nI want to say thank you to Ted and John for taking the time to serve us. The attention to detail throughout the night was amazing, and impressed us several times during the dinning experience. Ted is the man you want helping you decide from the impressive menu. He made us feel very at ease with our choices and made great recommendations. \n\nFor the appetizers we had the Kurobuta Pork Belly and it was absolutely delicious. The crunchy skin and tender center mixed with the cheesy grits created a great balance of texture and taste. A must have! \n\nFor the main course we had the famous Beef Wellington. My boyfriend and I have been watching Hells Kitchen for a long time and wanted to try one of his signature dishes. Let me tell you, it was more than we could have imagined! The Wellington was cooked perfectly.   The center was nice and pink, and \nthe potato pure, red wine Demi glaze, and vegetables compliment the dish perfectly. \n\nWe had a side of Mac and Cheese, and if you are a blue cheese lover, you will not be disappointed. Is a very unique dish full of flavor. \n\nFor dessert Ted recommended the signature Sticky Toffee Pudding. \nHowever, he went the extra mile to taylor the experience to our tastes and found out what flavors we preferred and recommended the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar. We where in heaven after taking the first bite!  If you are a peanut butter fan you must try this. The crunch from peanut butter ganache mixed with the peanut butter cremeux and chocolate mousse mixed well to make a perfect dessert to end the night. \n\nOverall it was an amazing dining experience from start to finish!  Next time you visit Vegas, you must make time to have a great dinner at Gordon Ramsey Steak. You will leave with a great smile and a happy belly!
