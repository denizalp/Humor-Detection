I always sit at the bar in Librettos. They have some great TV set ups for watching sporting events. They also have good drink specials and pizza by the slice. It's just like being in the Big Apple. \n\nI like coming in there at night when I want a meal that won't break my wallet but will also leave me full of delicious food. They have some great appetizers as well. My personal favorites are the pepperoni knots and the wings! But you really can't go wrong. The eggplant rollatini knocked our socks right off. \n\nIf you want a relaxing meal in a laid back environment I suggest the bar area of Librettos. The dining area is probably for families or something. I've never sat in there. Plus the closer you sit to the bar the less walking they have to do to get your drink to you right? \n\nShout out to alcoholism!
