I went here twice so far and Fries are super delicious, actually the best fries in LV I think, but burger is just ordinary taste sadly. Buns are normal levels and burger pate is just Nothing special taste. I like the shop's atmosphere and service is good also. So I hope they will reconsider of their burgers.
