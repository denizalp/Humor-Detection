My usual spot to swing by every time I'm in town.\n\nIt's definitely bigger than the one on Fairfax. They've got a much better selection compared to the one in Fairfax and the dudes who hold down the place are always cool and don't come off snobby. I never really understood the brands that hire their homies to represent the brand at the store with their snobby attitudes. So glad this place isn't like that.
