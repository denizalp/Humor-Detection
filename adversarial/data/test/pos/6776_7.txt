I was surprised by how much I liked it. I watched Kitchen Nightmares, so I had to check it out. I was waiting for the shit show to start!! There were only 2 tables that were eating. The servers were very attentive and picked up straw trash and sugar packets, refilled drinks. They were almost too nice, but I'd take that over being ignored. We had the flatbread and hummus. Flatbread tasted like naan bread and was good. Roasted red hummus was average. Eggplant parm was perfectly fried and full of flavor. The pesto was ok, just needed salt and pepper. The desserts were absolutely beautiful.  I tried to talk to Amy, but she seemed annoyed.  We ordered cheesecake and white coconut tart, and a pepperoni, sausage, pesto pizza to go. Sammy asked how our food was as we left, and he was quite friendly. Damn, I didn't get yelled at! I really was expecting fireworks, but am pleasantly surprised on how good the food was. I re-heated the pizza at home. Thin, very, flavorful crust, toppings were generous: large pepperoni slices, not the little packaged kind. The center of the pizza seemed a bit doughy, but it was still really good.  I honestly think it was one of the top 5 pizzas I've had in my life. Wish I could've hated this place! Lol. I really do hope that they can start getting more customers, and I don't think people should post who haven't even tried the food.  And I can't believe how nice I'm being. Rawr.
