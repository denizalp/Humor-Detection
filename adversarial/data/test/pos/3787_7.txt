I can't believe no one has reviewed this place and I'm not even living in TO. You people are horrible. \n\nAll i have to say is best in freshness, best in variety, best in cleanliness, and most of all best in service. They were out of bbq baskets - you know those things that keep the fish from falling apart, the lady went to the back to check and offer me hers from home. Now that's service, too bad she's married.\n\nAny thing you can think of they have Porgies, Snappers, Monk, Oysters east\/west\/ clams, lobster. I'd kill for Diana's to be in NY, but Astoria Seafood is almost as good. You pay a little more but you get fresh and well cleaned fish. And that's all i have to say about that.
