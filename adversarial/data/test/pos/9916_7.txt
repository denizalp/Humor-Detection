Read someone's quick tip that they were able to walk here from Douglasdale. Well, since that's where I am, I decided to check it out. \n\nDidn't walk, since I was with company, but it is pretty close by. A short drive through Bow Bottom, and it's in the shopping plaza with the Dollar Store and Donair Hut. A pleasant lady took our orders; I decided on their red espresso latté with soy, my sister had a chai latté, and my niece had a Pellegrino lemonade. There were also homemade bars: mocha fudge, lemon, and a gluten-free salted chocolate caramel bar. \n\nI'm not sure what exactly was in my red espresso, but it was tasty! The chai smelled wonderfully spicy, as well. Service was cheerful and pleasant. It's good to know that, even in suburbia, there are independent cafés within walking distance.  Will definitely stop by again very soon :). Wish they had wi-fi, though! \n\nETA: I just Google-fu'd Red Espresso: It's Espresso made with Rooibos tea! Delicious.
