I had dinner here with my husband and a good friend of mine with whom I used to work.  Overall, the food was good, but it was way too loud in there and made catching up really difficult.  \n\nMy husband and I got there first, so we started off with some half fries-half sweet potato fries ($3.75) to munch on while we waited for my friend.  They were hot and crispy and really good.  I thought that they would separate the different types of fries, like one on each side, but they were all mixed together.  Not really a big deal, but thought that I would mention it.\n\nFor my main, I got the turkey burger ($9.25) on a lettuce bun.  I love how they have some unusual free toppings that you can order, and lots of cool sauces too.  I got sauteed onions, tomatoes, beets and alfalfa sprouts.  I also got chipotle mustard and chipotle ketchup.  Let me tell you, the chipotle condiments were spicy and added a nice kick to the burger.  The lettuce bun was iceberg lettuce.  I would have preferred it if they used Boston lettuce, but iceberg admittedly holds together better, even though it's my least favourite of all the lettuces.  The turkey burger itself was well cooked and very flavourful.  Not too salty, nor too fatty\/greasy.  Toppings were fresh and tasted well together.  I found it a little pricey for just a burger, but I think these are the prices for downtown Toronto.  \n\nMy husband had the slider sampler ($21.99).  This was a platter of 6 sliders: (I think they were) beef, brisket, kobe, bison, lamb and turkey.  They came on tiny little sesame seed buns.  I didn't have any, but the hubby said they were good.  You can't chose the toppings on these, they come with default toppings which are different for each slider.\n\nMy friend had the lamb burger ($11.75) and he added some premium toppings which they charge for, cheese ($1.75) and avocado ($2.50) and he also got the onion rings ($4.75).  The onion rings were huge!  Like each one was bigger than my palm.  He was kind enough to give me one and it was good, but because of the size, the onion wasn't as soft as I like.  The panko breading was crunchy, but I think I like regular battered onion rings better.\n\nOur server was very nice and attentive.  I think his name was Anthony (he had a British accent).  \n\nWe were there at 6pm and I was surprised how loud the place was, considering it was still early.  By around 8:30pm it had gotten unbearably loud and we had to leave because we couldn't take the noise any longer.\n\nOverall, good food, but a little pricey in my opinion, and way too loud for my taste.
