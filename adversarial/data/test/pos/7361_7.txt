Visiting the folks back in Lakewood and mama says: \"We need bread.\"\n\"Where should I go?\" the good son replies. \nMama again: \"That place on Detroit...\"  \nGood son: \"Uhh...I haven't lived here for over 20 years.\"\nMama again: \"Take the car, you'll find it, it will be right in front of your eyes if you just look.\"\nPerturbed, yet still good son huffs: \"OK, where are the car keys?\".....\n\nSo off I go, in pursuit of bread somewhere on Detroit Rd.  I make my way west through Lakewood and don't see any promising signs, but then wait...could mama have meant Giant Eagle?  No way.  That is not a bread store, although I'm sure they SELL bread and it is just off Detroit Rd.  I discard that momentary lapse in judgment and I keep going west and now I make it to downtown Lakewood. Could my quest be over...I see it, the sign, Panera!  My smile begins to disappear as my brain cells start firing - just because they have the word BREAD in their name doesn't mean they are THE bread store.  Close, but this is not horseshoes people, this is bread we are talking about, this is about carbs, screw Atkins. \n\nWestward ho!  And then, finally it appears to me, as I pass W. Clifton and Detroit Rd., just like mama said \"right in front of your eyes if you just look\", Breadsmith- Artisan Breads.  \n\nI so badly want to make a U-Turn to get the one remaining parking spot left on Detroit, but I resist the impulse, this is Lakewood OH and one doesn't even consider jaywalking let alone making U-Turns.  Eventually I park (no dedicated lot and if you park in the church lot across W. Clifton then you will have to answer to a much higher authority...Baker Towing) and walk into bread heaven.  I have found it, this is THE BREAD store on DETROIT in Lakewood!\n\nThe first thing you will encounter when you open the door to Breadsmith, aside from the aural ding of the bell, is that sensational, memory inducing, and completely reassuring smell of freshly baked bread.  This is a great start to your experience; then you hear the cheerful and sincere sound of the employee, not only offering to help, but also giving you a warm greeting.  Nice. There is a lot to choose from, so I play it safe and select the Rustic Italian, free form, and not sliced.  This is one of their Everyday breads, as in the make it each and every day they are open.  In no way is the taste every day however, it is exceptional!  I like the crust, the way the bread slices, the taste, the all-around goodness.  Breadsmith also has a rotation of different breads for each day, like Greek Olive Focaccia on Saturdays, too bad it was Sunday, no wait, Brioche Cinnamon Swirl, YES!  \n\nJust like mama says, open your eyes and you will find THE BREAD store on Detroit Rd.
