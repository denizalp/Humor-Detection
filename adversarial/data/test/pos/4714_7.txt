Brunch on a Saturday at 11am isn't something that fits into our schedule on the regular, but with our first visit with Lulu being such, I have to say I'm looking to be a regular here. There was hardly a soul around and it was wonderful. Warm, breezy weather with all of the windows open, 80's music blaring, and hot coffee.....Sign me up. \n\nSported a menagerie of choices for our brunchtacular adventure -- Country Benedict, pimiento cheese grits, creme brulee French toast, Neese's sausage, and the morning frites. The sides were fantastic. The grits are rich, but not overpoweringly. The frites work wonders on your palate with the mix of peppers and onions. \n\nFrench Toast reminded me of what I grew up with. Thin cut, easy-going, not overtly sweet, hot syrup on the side, and powdered sugar. YES.\n\nThe Country Benedict. Duuuuuuuuuude. I've never been a fan of eggs Benedict, but the hollandaise on top of the perfectly poached egg, on top of a wonderfully buttered\/toasted piece of sourdough (or maybe boul√©) worked so well. \n\nService was impeccable, friendly, and welcoming. Prices are fair for Brunch, and the menu isn't too expansive. Looking forward to many visits to come.
