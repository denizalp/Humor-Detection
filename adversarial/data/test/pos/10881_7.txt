We stopped here for ice cream after having pizza at Sal's next door. This seems like a nice  little lunch box. We just had the ice cream so this review is based on that. The server was friendly. I had cherry amaretto ice cream. It was pretty good. Nothing fantastic but it hit the spot. They have a nice selection  of sandwiches and hotdogs. May try them some day. Watch for the review when we do.
