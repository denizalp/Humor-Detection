Three cheers for the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card!\n\nKnowing I was traveling from Canada to the US, I should have realized I was going international. I guess keeping my feet on North America, it kinda just slipped, but as I emerged on the other side of the duty-free shop at the Calgary International Airport, it all clicked. \n\nNaturally, that drove me to check for any nearby Priority Pass lounges, and low and behold, the Aspire Transborder popped up, and I was right next to it! So I showed my card and was politely informed they'd be closing at 7PM (it was 6:30ish) but that I should make myself comfortable. \n\nIn the 30 minutes I was there, I had the chance to grab a few drinks, a bite to eat, and a few snacks for the flight home. I sat at a high top, which wasn't the most comfortable, but I did see some nice chairs and sofas, as well as TVs with news from around the world. The lounge has a decent selection of spirits setup in a self-serve style. The bottles have the pour stops on em, so that just means tip twice for a double! I really appreciate this in the lounges, as you can make the drink you want. By the time I got there the food was just about packed up, but I managed to get a few bites of beef over rice and picked up a croissant for the road.\n\nHaving access to these international lounges is such an incredible perk of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. They charge like $60-$80 per visit, and with the card you can visit any lounge in the network as many times as you like while a cardholder. \n\nThis card keeps finding ways to pay for itself, and this lounge is just another fine example of how great it is to be part of the Chase family.
