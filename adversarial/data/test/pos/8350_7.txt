I wish I could give this place either no stars or a negative 5.  That's NEGATIVE 5 stars.  Yuk. Ugh. Gross. I picked this place for two reasons, the reviews that said it was \"awesome\" and because it was right by my apartments.  never again.  I walked in to what looked like a nail trough with ladies everywhere.  I was NOT relaxed.  I was tense the entire 15 minutes (yes..that's right folks, my pedi took a wopping 15 minutes).  So disappointed. I'm so glad that the cost was only $25 but now I'm scared that I will get a foot fungal of some sort.  They don't clean their tubs, their instruments, nothing.  Yes they serve wine and beer for free but who cares.  So do other quality salons.  Stay away.  It's not worth the risk of getting an infection.  Ugh.  so gross.....I will pay the extra money to for a better experience.
