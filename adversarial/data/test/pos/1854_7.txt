I'm stayed in hotel Vdara. I was given a \"four hand massage Hawaian \" Lomi-lomi\" as a gift. The staff was highly knowledgeable and very informative to my specific needs. The four hand massage was definitely a unique experience. I recommend purchasing over an hour, if money is not an issue, as it took me time to settle and correct my breathing. Wonderfully exceptional experience. No doubt, I will be coming back!!
