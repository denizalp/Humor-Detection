We frequent sushi restaurants regularly including several all-you-can-eat places. Over the several years, even the AYCE restaurants have improved in quality of their fish.  \nMy husband and I decided to try Kobe Sushi Bar on a whim. Didn't realize it was an AYCE restaurant. The quality of the fish was downright bad. Fish was definitely not fresh and smelled. The so called sashimi was not sashimi. It was marinated and soaked in sauce.  Even then the fish tasted bitter.  Ordered some salmon and white fish sushi and the fish was definitely not fresh.  They smelled. This is by far the worst sushi restaurant an't we have been to. The fish being displayed on the bar look very old. I normally take pictures But it looks Horrible I actually didn't take any pictures today
