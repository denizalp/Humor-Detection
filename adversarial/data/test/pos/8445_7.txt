I'm gonna give New York New York 4 stars, where I would normally rate a large Vegas Hotel of any type at 3 stars max (due to prices)...    And the reason this gets 4 stars is due to the fact that their roller coaster was so rough, violent and scary that it pretty much frightened the living son of Jesus out of my brother and I.   \n\nMy brother and I are veterans of some of the most notorious roller coasters in the US.   And upon walking by New York New York, and hearing the screams of the people riding, we thought it looked \"cute\".   We noticed the signs warning people with heart conditions, etc., not to ride it and just thought \"Yeah, yeah yeah, whatever, bring it on.\"  \n\nI can tell you why the people were screaming.   I know now...    It's because they were terrified of dieing!     This coaster shakes more than any I have ever rode in my life, and from an engineering point of view, when riding, I was 100% certain that the wheels were going to break and we were going to be killed.   I was totally sure of that.   In fact my brother says that I screamed \"I want off this ****** NOW!!!!\".    I don't recall that, but once you're on it, there ain't no one to listen to your demand that it stop.....     :)\n\nAfter that ride, our parents were laughing and said that we looked \"pale\".    So we rode it again.    \n\nAfter the second ride my brother could not stop laughing as I had \"slobber\" all over my shirt.   I don't recall \"slobbering\" but sure enough I was covered in slime.     Those two rides are all I care for on this roller coaster.   I won't do it again.    But I highly suggest it for anyone that wants to get to know their own religious beliefs a little bit better, quite fast.
