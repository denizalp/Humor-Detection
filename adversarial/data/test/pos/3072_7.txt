MEH. \nIt's fine, but it's definitely not worth the wait. The amount of time I would wait for this, had I known the taste beforehand, would be like MAXIMUM 10 minutes. And that's only if I was like suddenly craving a dessert akin to a sugary cheese cotton puff. It's almost TOO light. \n\nIf anything was remotely satisfactory, it would be those non-madeleine looking madeleines. Buttery and tasty when starved (after waiting in line for 90 minutes) and when they're fresh out of the oven. But wait a couple of hours and those soft buttery cakes are equivalent in taste and texture to the wrapped, over processed madeleines you can get over at Starbucks for --- wait for it --- ZERO WAIT TIME! *applause*\n\nAll in all, don't go... Don't go. Don't go!\nUnless you have a friend you want to catch up with in line and have nothing else worthwhile to do whatsoever. :)\n\nBUT, gosh darnit, if you are as stubborn as mule, take a look at my pictures for more info on prices and times.
