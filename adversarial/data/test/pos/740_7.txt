If you are a history buff or love to listen to a lecture, this is the tour for you.  \n\nI do realize the information provided is describing the vegas history.  But doing the night tour I just wanted to see the cool old signs lit up.  It was a lot of standing around looking at mediocrity.  Blah.  Our tour guide probably didn't take any breaths for an hour straight.  I wish we could have walked through without a tour guide.  It would have been more enjoyable.  \n\nI wouldn't rush back nor would I recommend it.
