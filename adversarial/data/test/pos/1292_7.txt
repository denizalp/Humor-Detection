Note: This review is for injectables. I went in for Botox and Juvederm with Jayme. I also got to meet Gaye, who is their new Practice Manager, who is really sweet and nice. Jayme was fabulous. She was really friendly and so patient with my endless questions. Every time she walked into the room, I'd think of a couple more questions. She was very knowledgeable. They use a numbing gel, so there was little to no pain. And she was great at going minimal. I love the way my lips look, but it wasn't such a change that anyone else could tell. I now love wearing lipstick - something I never did previously. And the Botox on my forehead completely eliminated the deep crease I wanted gone. Again, subtle and not overdone. I can't believe I waited so long to get this done. And the prices seemed pretty reasonable too. I'll definitely be coming back to see Jayme. If you're considering injectables, it's worth it and you'll want to come here to get it done.
