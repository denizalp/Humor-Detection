Hands down the worst bar I've ever been to and I'm originally from Detroit, Michgan. The bartender Michelle, who I think is the assistant manager, is a rude and very unprofessional bartender. She is the perfect example of what not to be in a bar employee. Never smiles unless to regulars, terrible attitude, doesn't comp drinks even if you put a $100 in, and then rolls her eyes at a $5 tip after she totally wrecks you on your comps. Will only go back in the mornings to see the girl who is from Indianapolis and is nothing but courteous and comps well. But overall, DON'T COME HERE! MICHELLE WILL RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE. AWFUL IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!!!
