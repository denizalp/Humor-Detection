Want to be waited on by a staff of people who are noticeably hungover, but still pumping out good food? Also, need to start your summer base tan? Cafe Hollander! The place stacks cafe dwellers on top of each other and sitting at the top gives you a great view of the Hilldale Target...if you know what I mean. \n\nBeware of wicker chair legs!
