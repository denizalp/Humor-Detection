What can I say about Fluer, by Hubert Keller at the Mandalay Bay? This place is gorgeous! As with most restaurants at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, this place is no exception to the rest. This is a beautifully designed restaurant!\n\nThere are ample parking at the Mandalay Bay's hotel parking lot, by either valet or self-park. There is also parking at the Luxor, with a quick walk across the bridge through the Shops at Mandalay Bay which connects the two resorts. Fluer is located south of the casino floor along restaurant row at the Mandalay Bay!\n\nFrom the moment you walk down the long hallway of this beautiful hotel, all of the restaurants in restaurant row are lookers! I have  heard from friends you could just pick one and would not be disappointed! After all, it is a 5-star hotel! I would rate my experience at Fleur as a 5-star! Dress code could be described as beautiful, business, casual attire.\n\nIt was happy hour so we ordered a few drinks and had the Caesar salad to start. There are only so many words to describe a salad, so honestly? It was delicious! Very delicious! They do have an extensive cocktail menu of wines, champagne, craft beers (they offer a milk stout for you beer lovers with the Mandalay Signature label exclusive to the hotel by Left Hand Brewery), and cocktail and spirits!\n\nFor my main entree I ordered the Lomo Saltado (a 12 oz. grilled New York steak, with a soy aji Amarillo glaze and Peruvian fried rice). The steak was soft, tender and juicy, one of the best prepared New York steaks I have ever had!\n\nAs a side order to the New York steak, we ordered the garlic fries, which came with two dipping options: ranch dressing and\/or ketchup! \n\nLastly, I ordered the Classic Tiramisu for dessert! Yummy! The Tiramisu was served in a martini glass! Very nice! I have never had Tiramisu served out of a martini glass before!\n(For those not familiar with a Tiramisu dessert, it is a coffee flavored sponge cake, coffee and cognac syrup, dark chocolate ganache, chocolate chunk pearls). In Italy, it is called\nGianni Doglia, Moscato d' Asti, from Piemonte, Italy.\n\nChef Hubert Keller offers creations from across the globe, including  USA, France, Japan, Peru and Italy....... Chef's inspires desserts hail out of Hungary, Italy and Portugal! Quite a Worldly experience!\n\nService was exceptional! I would like to commend Jason, our bartender\/server, who took care of us during the whole experience! Thank you, Jason! I look forward to my next experience here! If you are ever at the Mandalay Bay, be sure to check out Fluer! :)
