Holy cow...if anyone likes a good Sandwhich def come to this joint....great selection with a different special every week, great slection of chips and amazing service...after about 10 min of deciding, I went with the \"Vernon Davis\" while my friend went with \"The Bella\" ...went 1\/2 and 1\/2...they were UNREAL...prices nothing crazy but definitely not cheap...regardless some of the best sammies I've ever had !!
