I booked our stay through Priceline.  I provided a credit card for resort fees and the security deposit at check in. The room was nice. Very spacious. \nAfter checking out I noticed the security deposit had not been refunded. I called the hotel, They blew me off saying it may take up to 7 business days to show up. I waited 10 business days and called again. After arguing with a few people I finally got a front desk manager who informed me that the deposit had been refunded to the credit card that booked the room, not the card they charged it on. So, they refunded my security deposit to Priceline??\nI still have yet to recieve my security deposit back!\nDON'T STAY HERE, IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE
