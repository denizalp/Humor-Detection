They have an amazing selection of beer and a slightly limited menu for food. \n\nI ordered my regular g&t - very very average, the amount and the drink itself is something I can easily get at bar244 for $3..not watered down but very medicore. \n\nFood was terrible...unbelievably disasterous. The nachos were dry and tasteless. It only came with the sour cream dip, not even salsa or guac???!?\n\nAnd the calamari was a joke...\n\nOur server disappeared for a good 30-40 min, then suddenly came back to check up on us every 5 minutes.
