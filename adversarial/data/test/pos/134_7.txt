The kind of place that everyone can find something to chow down on, Lucille's BBQ is popular with my extended family.  With a party of 11, we came here last night for my cousins' birthday dinner at their choosing.  Located at Red Rock Casino, there is a separate entrance to the restaurant so you don't even have to enter the casino unless you have to use the restroom because there aren't any in Lucille's. Reservations were made in advance and we were seated at a long table that accommodated all of us quite easily.  I've been to this location before with friends who also chose it for a celebration, it may have been a birthday, too, but I don't remember.  What I do like about this place is that the service is excellent.  I want to give a special shout-out to Miles, the staff member who was assigned to our table last night.  This guy took care of our larger group from beginning to end and was especially attentive to my littlest cousins who sat at one end of the table together.  Miles took their orders, crouching down to speak to them at their level and treated them, 7 and 9 year olds, with as much courtesy as he did the adults.  \n\nAs for the food, the menu is the huge kind with loads of choices.  We started off with their biscuits and apple butter that came out fresh and hot.  They're hard to resist so why try?  I had the BBQ half chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries.  Between the chicken, some of the mashed potatoes, plus a biscuit, it was more than enough food for me and it was all good.  My son ate the fries which he requested because his pulled pork sandwich only came with one side and he wanted more.\n\nMiles checked on us often and everyone had a satisfying meal. When I asked him to take a group picture of us at the end, Miles wanted to clear some of the table off first so it didn't look so trashed plus he took more than one picture:  this guy knows what he's doing.  I would definitely recommend this location if you're a fan of Lucille's for the wonderful service and hearty food.
