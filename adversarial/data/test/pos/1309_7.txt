If I had one night with someone in Champaign, someone from someplace far-far-away, one night to be a gentle soul's Virgil, no ... Beatrice, yes ...Beatrice, as he explores the graceful, yet sublime, spheres of heaven, our trek, our ascension would end here. KAMS is the Empyrean of Champaign life. Simply put, to experience KAMS is to be enveloped in all that is good, all that is beautiful, and most importantly everything that makes no sense to an ordinary human at all.
