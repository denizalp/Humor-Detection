Finally had the chance to take the family and some close friends and check this place out for lunch. It's been on my list of new places to try out for a long time. Not to mention we had a $50 gift that was screaming to be used up.\n\nThis location is a masterfully transferred old federal bank building that used to do business here in another lifetime. It has everything from the old drive thru to the super old metal covered parking area for the previous bank employees.\n\nInside is themed with the current hipster vibe and they did a great job exploring ways to make both the decor and the food interesting and great tasting at the same time.\n\nWe started with several appetizers and decided to share most the food. Ordered the F&A Veg Board, the Wedge Salad and two plates of the Arancini. They were all very delicious and left us in the mood for some main entrees.\n\nNext we decided on the Lamb Bolognese, a Big Star Pizza, a Meatball Pizza and a Casanova Pizza. Everything was very good and we really enjoyed all the fresh ingredients. Even the grand kids did a great job of polishing off their portions.\n\nThe pizzas were also tasty but the dough and crust were not anything special and different than what we were used to eating. We all generally agreed that we preferred more of a Chicago or NY style pizza crust during our drive back home.\n\nService was friendly and the food came out hot and ready to eat. We did have a small problem trying to talk over the loud music. My wife even ask them to turn it down a little bit and had no luck. The music was so loud in the bathroom that I started having psychedelic flashbacks from my college days. Nice!\n\nOverall we had a fun time and would most likely go back again. Get your buns over here and show this place your dance moves. They also have a large selection of spirits and other alcoholic beverages that you can enjoy. Maybe the loud music is more appealing when you are three sheets to the wind? BEER ME!\n\n3.75 STARS
