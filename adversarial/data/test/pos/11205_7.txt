Pretty desert course in Summerlin next to its sister property where the PGA event is held. The greens are fast and the course itself is a bit challenging. The carts have GPS and the clubs for rent are awesome! Only issue I have is not being offered any water\/Gatorade in our coolers, unlike other courses in Vegas, especially for the price.
