i mean, it's a rental car place. do they give you the car you reserved? yes. are they efficient? yes. friendly? yes. \n\nmost car rental places fail on at least one of these counts, and in fact, i've rented from enterprise at other locations and they had a massive failing on these fronts. but the reason i wrote this review is because the interaction was somewhat comical.\n\nfirst, both guys at the place seem very young, early 20s at most. and i think they think the job is somewhat comical. why do they need to dress up fancy to give someone a rental car? especially since they are actually dealing with cars, often dirty, all day long. all kinds of absurdity, likely imposed by enterprise corporate. the decor is straight out of \"the office.\" i could go on. \n\nanyway, the guy who seems like the boss is wearing this slightly too large suit, and while the other guy is checking us in, with a huge grin on his face with every required question, the boss just shouts out, \"hey i got a great SUV for you guys! wanna upgrade?\" \n\nwe don't. but i almost laugh. the boss is just hanging out in back, and he shouts it out. like your friend who goes to the fridge and yells out, \"anybody want a beer?\"\n\ni suspect these guys would go insane if they didn't have each other.
