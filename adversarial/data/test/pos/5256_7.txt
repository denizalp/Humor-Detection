I try not to throw around 5-stars out like gang signs, because I really want to reserve the primo ratings for places that really knock my socks off. But, Giuseppe's is quite deserving of the highest rating because it really is a gem of a place. \n\nVoted New Times Best of Phoenix Neighborhood Italian (2003), veal (2004) and BYOB (2005), Giuseppe's certainly has earned such accolades. However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I'll most definitely be trying the veal. And since I went with Robert M, you should know that BYOB is a given. Well, honestly, since I showed up it's almost certain that I'm carrying some form of alcohol on my person. \n\nAfter watching a decidedly emotionally-charged movie at Camelview (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, an amazing must-see even though a key element in the film is grossly misleading--PM me if you've seen it and I'll share) Robert M and I needed to do something to appreciate the goodness in life so we decided to devirginize ourselves of the Giuseppe's experience. It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth. We also split the lasagna which was made with fresh pasta and plated with the most divine \"gravy\" [for all the Italians, although I'm Irish] that we've ever tasted. So *smooth* and not bitter or acidic or sweet or anything less than heavenly. If I could bathe in this, I would. But, since I'm not a splosher... :blush: \n\nIf only I wouldn't have eaten so much popcorn in the hour before going to Giuseppe's, I would have indulged in so much more. But, alas, I have found a reason to take this Avenue kid back to the Streets: Giuseppe's.
