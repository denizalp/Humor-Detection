Finally got the chance to try out this new little coffee spot, had been hearing good things about it since it opened. I tried the pumpkin, honey cappuccino which was delicious. It is inside the Evening Muse which is already a pretty awesome spot and while we were there they had folks set up selling donuts and a few other goodies. Def. worth stopping by if you are in the area.
