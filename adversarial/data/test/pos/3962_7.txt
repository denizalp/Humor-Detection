My pup Sugarbaby enjoys the outdoors even if it's over 100 degrees. So just walking her where I live during the day is a death sentence since it is so hot. Dog parks are a wonderful getaway where there is less heat and non-desert scenes so the puppy can safely enjoy the outdoors too.\n\nWith Yelp and my fellow Yelpers as my tour guide we decided to check this park out. The reviews and check in's I have seen were amazing. Some fellow Yelpers describe this park complex as having true tranquility and serenity. I enjoy nature and this park provides the user with nature, even though it was engineered and developed. Besides having a dog park area which we did not stay in long. It was very nice but my puppy likes to log the miles. We hit the trails together and explored this new location together. \n\nThe Mountain View's of the Sierra Nevadas are so amazing here. It is really breathtaking. The views of the mountains being so close add to the peacefulness here. It really makes one feel small being this close to the mountain range. The trails are well maintained and everyone we passed that was human was very nice. The furry ones want to interact too, but that's not always going to be. We enjoyed our private time here walking and tuning into nature. If just for a brief time.
