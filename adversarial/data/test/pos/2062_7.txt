Owen's Bagel & Deli has committed war crimes against my taste buds.  These are the worst bagels I've ever had that weren't purchased from a supermarket or a dirty food truck.  I took two bites and threw out my very expensive breakfast.\n\nIgnore the other reviews for Owen's.  It's clear that these people have no idea what a bagel is supposed to taste like.  This place is a joke.  Let's get specific:\n\n#1)  Flavor:  there isn't any.  These things have all the excitement of wonder bread.\n\n#2)  Texture:  Mush.   Bagel's are supposed to be soft, dense and chewy on the inside with a crispy but yielding skin on the outside.   At Owen's you get a steamed pile of mushy goo.  Yes, STEAMED... more on that in a moment.\n\n#3)  Toppings:  As any true New Yorker would do, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese a lox (that's smoked salmon for you North Carolina natives).  The fish they served me smelled really bad- not fresh at all... but what can you expect from an establishment that prides itself on Boar's Head meats?  Sidenote: Boar's Head is the Hunt's ketchup of deli meats- an inferior product that somehow maintains astonishing market share, despite offending anyone with taste buds.\n\nOkay, so back to the part where they STEAMED my bagel:  I had asked for a TOASTED onion bagel, because that's the proper way to warm a bagel.  The moron behind the counter nodded dumbly and didn't mention that apparently Owen's doesn't OWN A TOASTER!   Instead, without informing me, she STEAMS my bagel, turning it instantly into soft, gooey mess, without even a hint of the crispy crust that the bagel may have started with.  If any heating method is the exact opposite of toasting a bagel, it's STEAMING a bagel.  It's like steaming a pizza or a hamburger... you just don't do it. \n\nIf I could give Owen's Bagel's a rating with negative stars, that's what I'd be doing right now. \n\nAfter throwing out the worst bagel ever from Owen's, I drove a few minutes away to Bruegger's.   Sure, Bruegger's in a boring chain, but they at least know how to make a bagel that doesn't suck, and they understand how to work a toaster.  Also their smoked salmon was fresh.  I never thought I'd recommend them over an independently owned Bagel shop, but in this case, I have to.
