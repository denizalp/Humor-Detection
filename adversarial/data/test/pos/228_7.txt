...called at 6p to see if they would take reservations for that night. yes, but not 7p... 7:15p is open. Cool, table for 4 at 7:15 it is. We arrived at 7:10 and were told we will call your name when a table is ready... at 7:25 I asked if our 7:15 reservation was ready yet and she said we are a little behind. There are a few still ahead of you... Our name was called at 7:46 after 4 tables of 4 and a table of 6 were seated. \nAnyone can take a reservation... Its the holding of the reservation that counts right? (UNHAPPY)\n The food was OK, a small salad for the table, 2 shared dinners for 4, a side of pasta with a meatball & 1, $12 bottle of wine and 2 deserts nothing worth going out of your way for at a cost of almost $150.00. There was also 5 or 6 \"birthday\/clapping\" sessions around us like at Applebees.\nThe wait staff was nice, quick and good looking, but I'd rather have a slow, ugly waiter with good food myself.\nNo hurry to go back there... ever.
