It's a no-brainer why this is my favorite Trader Joes location:\n\n- Closest to home\n- Minutes from work\n- In Downtown Summerlin \n- Well stocked, organized, and great staff\n- Easy access to 215 and Summerlin \n   Parkway\n\nThere are so many choices here that you can't find at major chain supermarkets. There are many unique food items to choose from such as organic gluten free power bars to virgin coconut oil. They carry numerous items from almost every part of the planet! \n\nI find this place really entertaining. I can spend 15-20 minutes in each aisle and check out the goodies that always seem to catch my eye. Those food labels and packaging sure are working! This place is always a time saver for me. When I'm too exhausted to cook after a long day at work, it's TJ to the rescue!\n\nThey have the most amazing frozen food selections that can be prepared in minutes! The quality and taste sure beats some Chinese takeout in my neighborhood. The Mandarin Chicken and Shiitake Mushroom Chicken are delicious when it's prepared right! \n\nDon't get me started with their sweet selections... I have to mention their frozen french macarons are addicting and even better when an average macaron cost less than 50 cents! When holiday comes around, additional flavors are added!TJ! \n              \n                 You've earned my 5 STARS!
