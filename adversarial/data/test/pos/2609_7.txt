Don't hesitate! Book it! This worth every penny and with a Yelp! or Living Social deal you can't do any wrong. \n\nWe met up at Lynard Skynard at Excalibur where were offered complimentary appetizers and a free drink. We actually got a game of flip cup going and it made it even more of a value, because they supplied several pitchers of beer.\n\nAfter this we walked to Coyote Ugly, not a bad walk at all. You get over an hour at each spot, and they do a good job rounding up the groups. From there you hit Gallery, Chateau, and end up Tryst. There was a free shot to claim at each place after that. At Tryst we just stayed, you don't actually have to leave.\n\nI'm not going to review the clubs, but Sin City Club Crawl did everything they promised and more. At no point did we have to wait on line. After the first walk they take you around in party busses, complete with stripper poles! You can't go wrong with this one. You get to see a lot of clubs and meet a lot of great people. Lord knows what it would cost in covers to hit the last three clubs alone.\n\nI got more than my money's worth out of this one!
