Went here, wasn't aware of what time they close. When we pulled up the neon sign was lit up and said open. The door was unlocked. So we went in and wasted 10 min. Being confused as to why no one was coming to the counter to help us. After we were completely frustrated we walk out and then an employees magically appears, saying they are closed, I think she had been outside talking to someone the entire time. Wouldn't common sense be to turn off the light, lock the doors, or at least tell people you are closed when they first pull up? I have never tried this place and I guess now I never will because I am never going back. \nIf I could give 0 stars I would, or maybe even negative stars.
