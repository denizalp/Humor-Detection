Immediately upon entry I was impressed by the layout of Life. It's wide, so it's spacious when you compare it to Marquee or even Hakkasan from what my friends have told me. I was able to navigate from one end of the club to the other without much effort.\n\nThe crowd was friendly the night we went, compared to all the douchebags and fake EDM bandwagoners we dealt with the night before at XS. There's a free photobooth by the restrooms that prints and emails you a copy so just in case you get trashed, you can wake up the next morning to find pictures that you forgot you took, assuming your motor skills were still good enough to type your email address correctly. The sound system was nice and loud. Confetti is pretty much the norm, but holy shit! Whoever loaded those confetti cannons was trying to suffocate the club.\n\nLet me take a step back and say that the urinals here are awesome. Why? Whoever it was decided to put these piss cushion pads on the back of the urinal so when you're taking a piss, it doesn't splash onto your pants or your hands was BRILLIANT. Anyway, the sinks are unisex and the restroom attendants were really friendly.\n\nAlso, whoever I knotted the tie for at Steve Angello, I apologize because I was wasted and did like, a sloppy half-windsor knot. Don't judge me, haha.
