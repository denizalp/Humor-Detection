2.5 stars...it was ok. But since I got in at 11pm last night..I just wanted a comfortable bed and no screaming neighbors in the rooms next to me. The girl behind the counter was hopped up on meds and didn't look like a happy camper at all. Oh right...I'm not staying at a Westin or anything. \n\nThe room was ok. The beds were nice and firm, but I'm going to have to get king beds from now on cause I've been spoiled with king size pillows (on our queen size bed) so I felt like I didn't have enough pillow under my head. The decor was...plain. Oh right...not a Westin...I keep forgetting. \n\nThe complimentary breakfast was ok. Powedered eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, cinnamon rolls, etc. \n\nBut the best part was all the old people there...I swear it smelled like Ben Gay. \n\nWould I come back? Not if I didn't have to.
