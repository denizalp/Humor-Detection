Filipino food in Vegas!!! Yesss! Tastes better than my mom's cooking.... haha jk nothing is better than home cooked Filipino food by Nanay and Lola. Anyway so glad we found this place... craving longsilog and tosilog -- but we arrived late and breakfast was over. So on to lunch.  We ordered sinigang (yummmm sour), fried fish (is that tilapia?) with JUFRAN, lechon (not enough meat) and menudo (didnt try it).  I like this place better than Kapit Bahay before they closed down. I think its cute, they allow you to eat first before you pay lol.
