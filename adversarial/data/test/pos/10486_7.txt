The end product was good however the overall experience was not pleasant. I've NEVER been charged extra for having my old gel removed. My nails lasted as long as expected however having a conversation with Pam was like pulling teeth I bought a deal on Deal Chicken as someone who needs to use Deal Chicken to drum up business she was not trying to hard to keep my loyalty. I will not go back to Pam.
