We were told this place was a good spot with a lively nightlife. When we went there only people that were there were having dinner. We went to the bar and had a drink. We ordered the infused vodka with blackberry and lychee. It tasted like syrup. We struggled to finish our drink. We didn't have any of the food. I am just rating the bar.
