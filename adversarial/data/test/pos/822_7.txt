I believe this is the only or one of the only gay bars in Urbana-Champaign and may I say, it blows... It is really huge, with a large dance floor, three pool tables and a few other games. Obviously college crowd, but I wouldn't call it a crowd as much as a smattering of town folk. The drinks were ridiculously cheap, something like $3 beers and $4 vodka tonics. They did have $3 cover though, odd. I wonder if it actually gets crowded ever. I guess it was early-ish for a Saturday but still... I'd have expected more kiddos since there so many of them here, but I guess many are underage. Oh well, but this place has potential.
