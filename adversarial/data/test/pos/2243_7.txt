I was a little skeptical because English food isn't exactly considered a fine culinary experience. (For some reason I think of bleating sheep and porridge whenever i think of English food?) But I had the Oggie's (traditional) pasty and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The crust is flaky, but not like a croissant. It's tougher than that. The pasty came with a very nice gravy that tasted a bit like a mild A-1 sauce. The selection of European beers is quite wide.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.
