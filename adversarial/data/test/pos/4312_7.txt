Stopped in on our way out of the Ross Park Mall.  Guess shopping makes us hungry.  We sat at the bar and our service was great.  We received bread and dipping oil to start.  I ordered from the lunch duo of a 7\" pizza and salad.  A nice meal at a fair price. Enjoyed the pizza with a good crust and had the Mediterranean salad.  Was not a fan of the salad because the dressing is a mustard herb vinaigrette that is just to mustardy, while I do enjoy mustard, the mustard overwhelmed any other taste of the salad.
