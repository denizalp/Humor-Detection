So much fun! It was my friend's birthday. She'd not been with a man in quite some time, and she was a self-described prude; I needed an environment where she could cut loose and have fun but feel safe and comfortable. I'd spoken with the manager ahead of time, and he'd been exceptionally honest in saying that he couldn't promise me the best seats, etc. He could have just taken my money, but he didn't, and I really appreciated his honesty. (There's a story about a different group who were totally skeevy.) He said instead that we were most likely to get great seats if we arrived earlier in the evening, rather than later. The two of us were picked up by free limo in exchange for having to buy two drinks each. That's fair, especially as it was only $50 total for all four drinks. We got there early, and the women around us were still too sober. We brought our own fun to counteract the grumpy grumpsters behind us. That was around 8:30 pm, I think. But the men were already dancing, and they were all just gorgeous, gorgeous men. Those fabulous dancers were immediately attentive and charming. And soon, the place was hopping. We enjoyed a number of very attentive dances without having to share until the place got packed around 12:30 AM. When we left, it was full of crazy women having an awesome and amazing time. (I guess the key is to make sure your bachelorette or birthday group isn't full of pissy women, and come prepared with a good attitude.) \n\nAs to how Hunk Mansion compares to others, my previous experience with strippers involved a couple of local shows at home, Men of X (MOX), Thunder from Down Under (TFDU), and Olympic Gardens (OG). MOX and TFDU are just male revues in which you sit amongst way way way too many women and have no real interaction with the guys. At TFDU, for example, a bride seated in the middle of our overpacked table kept walking into the aisles and *trying* so hard to have interactions with guys. While very inexpensive, those shows are so impersonal and lame as to be a waste of time. And forget getting drinks at the overpacked bars of the male revues! Hunk Mansion is SO much better than those places! The men at HM were all over us, and my friend got all of the attention she could possibly want. It was easy enough to get drinks at the bar, and the bartender was such a sweetheart and outrageous flirt. Any woman would feel honored by the attention. It was nice that not only did my friend whose birthday we were celebrating get some affection, but so did I as her buddy. \n\nAs to how it compares to OG, Hunk Mansion is way better. I swear that most of the men at OG the last time that I was there were on drugs, were not very good dancers, and only one guy had seemed to actually have any interest in being sensual with women. Whereas at Hunk Mansion, the men love women. (Holy moly! Hector is insanely sensual. That guy looooooves women! Seriously, get a dance or five from Hector.) They're also more athletic and better dancers. I felt like OG was totally lame, and I wondered why women got shafted (excuse the pun) at strip clubs. Why do the men only get high quality and beautiful dancers? Whereas at Hunk Mansion, it's what a woman would hope to experience at a strip club. \n\nI also liked that the men at Hunk Mansion were upfront with prices and expectations, so you knew exactly what you'd get, and it was a very fair transaction. Much as in real relationships, it's always better when there's honesty involved.
