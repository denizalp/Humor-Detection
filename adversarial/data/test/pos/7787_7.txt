Don't say that you're open until 1 am if you're not. Just walked 15 minutes to Dutch Dreams in the rain, got there at 12:30 am to reward myself with some ice cream after battling a shitty day, then realized they weren't open. I looked for hours of operation on the door or side windows, but found nothing. It's not that f*cking hard to take 2 minutes out of your day to update your hours of operation (and maybe... post them on your front door as well OMG like a business!).\n\nWILL REMOVE THIS REVIEW ONCE THEY POST HOURS OF OPERATION
