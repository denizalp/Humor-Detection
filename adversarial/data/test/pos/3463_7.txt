I used to see Dr Ahmad. I think she's an excellent doctor but this clinic has the worst staff and scheduling sucks! The doctor is not very friendly. She will not listen to the patient and borderline rude and so is the staff. i am not kidding when I say I have waited to see her close to 4 hours. No apologies from her or her staff. Then the consult is less than 5 minutes. I do not recommend this doctor. She is probably good but she is not worth it. Find somebody else.
