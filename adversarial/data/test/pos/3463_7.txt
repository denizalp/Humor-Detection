Why TAO WHY?!!?\n\nTo sum it up: Too small for Vegas. \n\nI wish I could rave about this place just because I have so many great memories here, but the greatness had nothing to do with the venue. This place gets too crowded too fast, the dance floor is the same size (maybe even smaller) as Incahoot's (Fullerton, CA) -- and that ain't nothing to be proud of. The drinks are pricey, the bartenders are smiley and accommodating, the security team inside are nice dudes, and the ladies bathroom upstairs is pretty legit with those trippy doors. TAO would receive more stars for the roof top bar area, but it's not always open. \n\nOverall, the club is nice. I'm not sure about cover because I've always been on the guest-list so it's all comped. If there was more space for people that don't have tables\/VIP whatever, that would make this place more spacious and worth going to.
