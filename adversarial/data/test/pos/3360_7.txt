Ok so I'm not from the east coast so I've tried many burgers in Vegas and I was pretty disappointed with these. \n\nFood: \nCheese sliders- 2\/5 I ordered the cheese sliders. The burgers were small and pricey. I didn't like the smell of them and I didn't like how it tasted like a burger from any other franchised restaurant. Nothing stood out for me. \n\nChicken rings- 1\/5 Seriously don't get these. They are crispy but flavorless and super thin. Honestly thought McDonalds chicken nuggets were better. \n\nFrench fries- 2\/5 Fries were a bit soggy. But these were my favorite out of all the stuff I ordered. \n\nService is GOOD! 4\/5:\nExpect a long wait. I waited in line for more than an hour but I got my food in less than 5 mins! They are friendly and efficient!! They try to make the wait bearable by talking to you, which I thought was neat. \n\nOverall if your a person who likes a burger with flavor and who has ate many flavorful burgers, White Castle isn't for you. I was quite disappointed but many other people love the simplicity of their food. This joint just wasn't for me.
