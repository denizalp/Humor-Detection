An awesome dive bar with cheap drinks, burritos, and miniature bowling? Sign me up.\n\nThis bar is great. The vibe is perfect, the people are friendly, and the drinks won't set you back anymore than $5 or so. It's apparently a lesbian bar, but I hate labels. It's just a great bar, period. Any and everyone is welcome. \n\nApparently they do a pretty mean karaoke night where the duckpin bowling lanes become a massive stage. I'll have to time my next trip a little better so I can be sure to show Quebec what I've got.
