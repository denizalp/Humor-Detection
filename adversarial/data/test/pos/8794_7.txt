Prior to the Fozzy concert at Altar Bar, I was yet again in search of grub, and was foiled by Lefty's, which doesn't have a menu. Even though I am not a drinker, I was taken by Lefty's quiet, old, wooden charm. If I ever choose to dabble in the demon alcohol, I could imagine myself loafing about here without trouble. \n\nPssst. Start serving up burgers and wings and such. It'll be a hit! It's not as if there's no room. \n\nThis lefty (and I ain't talkin' 'bout my hands) endorses Lefty's for those who like the booze.
