This is a gorgeous and adorable store, though it's more about the idea of being a gardener than about actual plants as such. They carry heirloom seeds and some bags of organic potting soil and soil improvers, but the vast majority of the store is given over to garden-related tchotchkes, so it's not an urban substitute for going to a big locally owned nursery.\n\nThat said, if you want garden-related tchotchkes, this is hog heaven. It's all beautiful, clever, shiny, affirming, thoughtful, and ready to impress the readers of your lifestyle blog. Your credit card will leap out of your pocket and prostrate itself before the \"construct your own affirming flag string\" flags (cleverly retro!), the tiny placards for hipster saints (including one for bicycling), the many forms of colored glass, the little air plants suspended over flasks that look like labware, the many colorful things you could use to hold a party on your patio... also, there are books on how to make your garden exciting enough that it will be worthy of all these marvelous things.\n\nI vaguely recall this store being at Thomas and 15th Avenue (not street, per the disappointed reviewer), where it was equally full of lovely things but more risky to walk around.\n\nIf you want gifts for your avid-gardener friends -- or you have some spare cash to reward yourself for getting the dull tasks like weeding done -- this store is full of sparkly, sparkly win.
