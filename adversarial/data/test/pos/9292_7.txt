Our second visit to The Keg was on New Year's Eve.  Our first was sometime during the summer for happy hour.  It was one of those days that was seriously 113 degrees or so and I remember when I walked in to the bar I couldn't see anything.  It was so dark.  Normally I like that, but I had a hard time finding my husband.  I was thrilled when I put my hand on the right man.  My next thought was how much I liked the seating in the bar.  You can sit at the bar, they have high tops, they have cozy little seats along one wall, they have long tables for groups, and they have comfortable leather chairs along the front windows and by the fireplace.  Love the bar area.  \n\nThat visit we sat at the bar and had mojitos and shared an app and the bone-in ribeye.  Had an excellent time all around.\n\nNew Year's Eve is my husband's birthday as well, and this year he wanted to come back to The Keg for dinner.  This time we sat at one of the high tops and Kennedy took great care of us.  We ordered the calamari app and 2 of the bourbon maple martinis to start.  The calamari ($11) is great.  Nice and lightly fried and they have a few fried red bell peppers and jalapenos throughout for added flavor.  Enjoyed that a lot.  The drinks are very nice and made with Woodford Reserve, I just didn't think they were a great value at 10 bucks apiece.  More like $7 or $8.\n\nHe ordered the bone-in ribeye ($36 - 20 oz) again along with the twice-baked potato.  I'm convinced that is a perfect meal.  5-star all around.  Steak was a perfect med rare and the potato was just delicious with its rich buttery, bacony flavor.  I ordered the chicken and ribs ($28) with a side of vegetables instead of the fries and slaw.  There was nothing exciting or interesting about this meal.  Very generic flavors and the ribs were not very tender.  I wish I would have gotten something else.  Next time I'll probably go back to getting a steak.  With my meal I had the Angry Orchard ginger apple cider and that was delicious.  Mr. M ordered a glass of old vine zin to have with his steak.  That was very nice as well.  Total after tax, before tip was $121.08.  We will definitely go back to The Keg, but as we get to know the menu I'm learning what to avoid.  Great place overall.
