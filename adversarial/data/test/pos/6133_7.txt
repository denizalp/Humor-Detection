I've eaten here four times that I can remember. That's how I am starting this review. With quantity.\n\nWhy's that? Because that's all this place is about. All you can eat meat is all about quantity. If you want quality, you go on the other side of the strip and you eat at the steak places in the City Center places. If you want a sword's worth of meat, you come here.\n\nIt's worth the time it takes to chew through it all, though I do have some cautionary advice for you, depending on your evening's plans and how often you eat multiple pounds of red meat in a single sitting. Maybe consider this place on the night that you are not going to be bumping up against people for hours on end in a packed nightclub. The meat-burp-breath is not as popular as it used to be a few years ago. People are starting to move on to other fads, unfortunately.\n\nTaking a lady home? I hope you brought aromatic candles with you. Your room will smell like the dumpster behind a McDonalds by the time the sun starts beating against the blackout curtains.\n\nFive-hour flight back to the east coast? I hope the plane has a convertible roof, or you might set off the lavatory smoke detectors.\n\nNo? You've got it all under control? Okay. I won't give you the last bit of advice then.\n\nBest of luck.
