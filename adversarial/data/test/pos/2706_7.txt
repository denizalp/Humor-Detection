I've been to a bunch of the other gyms in and around Toronto (old and new TCA, old and new Rock Oasis) and I must admit this gym is very comparable to those ones. They have a nice area for bouldering, lots of high walls for top rope and lead climbing, and a variety of routes that are changed up fairly frequently. The people are friendly and the staff competent.\n\nBUT, with all that being said, they keep losing my information. I don't even know what the fuck that means to be honest. All I know is they keep making me fill out the same waiver form and doing the same belay test over and over. They do have computers. I see them at the front desk, so I don't know why this is happening. It confuses me. And its not like I come once every 3 years or something. This has happened three times over the past two months. Last night I had to wait around for 20 minutes to get a belay test because they were understaffed and a big group came in they had to take care of. Ridiculous. Get your shit together, Rockheads!
