While visiting my daughter in Tempe recently I made the mistake of pushing the garage door opener button to more easily access the beer cooler in my truck. After slapping the button I immediately thought I heard the cry of a wild bull elephant! I had to stop and think for a second.. did I land in Tanzania or was I really still in Sparky's back yard? After I came to my senses I realized no, my life dream of riding an Elephant would not happen today, but if I wasn't careful a life's nightmare of being crushed under a falling door might be!\nHey sorry Tempe, I'm not going to die in Sun Devil country, ill prefer to spend eternity with Wilbur and Wilma.\nAnyway I found the number for Raul, called him, he said he be there in a couple of hours and by thunder he showed up! He went right to the problem, gave me the info on I needed, quoted me a reasonable price to replace the original tired springs on the door. I approved it and an hour later I was enjoying my trip to the beer cooler while listening to the peaceful quiet and soothing sound of a well operating garage door. Thanks again Raul ! give him a call before your next Safari !
