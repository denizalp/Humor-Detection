So my daughter wants to have her birthday here.  They won't make reservations, they won't put our cake n the fridge.  Basically there customers service is a Zero in my book n the manager is very unprofessional and I give him a Fail as a grade. Just keeping it real. \n\nLet's see how the rest of the night goes. Stay tuned.
