world's most expensive bathroom!!!\n\nif i had to wait in line AND pay the cover charge to get into a club...wait, there's no \"if\" because that'd only happen over my dead body!!!\n\nthankfully, amex concierge service put us on the guests list of the hottest club on the vegas strip, so we cruised through a mile-long line and got to the front in a second.  we debated whether it was worth paying $20 cover, but decided to just pay the due, get drunk and dance our night away.\n\nfirst thing first...empty our bladders so we can drink more.  the ladies bathroom was on 3rd floor and while climbing up the stairs, several of us thought our bladders were about to explode.  the club was packed...butt to butt, boobs to boobs jammed to the point where moving an inch was nearly an impossible mission.  \n\nfinally, after our deeds, we approached the 1 big rectangular bar to get some drinks.  after 30 minutes of our furious attempts, we gave up.  at this point, we realized that getting to the dance floor would be almost as dangerous as getting thrown into a lion's den.  we inquired about getting a table (minimum charge was like $1000 if not more...f*cking ridiculous) in order to avoid the chaos, but none were available (HA!  some people were just as insane).\n\nthis club is in serious violations of fire hazard codes.  totally illegal and immoral of them to charge us the cover knowing how crowded the club was!!!  i could see the appeal of this place if girl on girl were my thing (girls in tiny tubs together, massaging each other).\n\nnot wetting our dresses + inhaling b.o.'s + failure to accomplish our missions (get drunk and dance) = $20 and 30 minutes \n\nyeah, f*ck that!!!
