I had a blast at this beerfest.  I saw some complaints about parking but my friend and I were dropped off and picked up so I can't speak to that.  I've been to a few beerfests in town and I was very happy with the water stations at this event.  It isn't summer so it was crazy hot but when you're drinking beer in the sun all day, water is key!\n\nThere was a great selection of brewers and beer and it was great to see all the local breweries together.  My friend and I bought the Living Social deal so we had early entry.  From 2-3 there weren't many people so it was easy to get some different samples without waiting in line.  Suddenly around 3:15 this place was packed.  Still, the lines weren't too bad in some spots and the most we ever waited was 10 minutes.  But we were waiting with our previous sample in hand so I'm not complaining.\n\nI thought there was a good selection of food at this 'fest and there were some freebies going around.  I would definitely hit this up again next year!
