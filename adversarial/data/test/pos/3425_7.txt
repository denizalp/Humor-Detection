Big Wong?\n\nYes. Yes. A million times yes. I don't know why I didn't start going to this place until recently because this place is literally a treasure. \n\nIt's located in probably the best food plaza on Spring Mountain so it easily gets overshadowed by Monta, Curry Zen, and Raku but wow! If you were to ask me to grab a quick bite to eat, I would choose Big Wong every single time now. \n\nThe menu items are based off of each other so if you're a lover of let's stay pork chop, you can literally have pork chop with rice or pork chop with noodle soup or even pork chop on its own! It's how they keep their prices so low but hey, I'm not complaining. \n\nMy go to order at Big Wong: Rib-eye over pasta and a side order of Roti. Whatever is in the rib-eye sauce has got me hooked. You get a good portion of meat, pasta, and potatoes for only $5! The Roti is a pancake that basically can go with anything (and it's only a dollar!!!). \n\nThe service is great as well! They seem to have only 5 people on staff per shift but they make it work. The older gentleman who seems to be the owner is able to cook, serve, and clean! He's quite the animated man whenever he interacted with us. \n\nSo thank you Big Wong. I'll be back soon!
