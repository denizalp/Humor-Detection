It's a love-hate relationship, i must say.\n\nLove: if you love filipino goodies, this is the best place! They even sell stuff you can't even find somewhere else. It's where I pick up stuff that reminds me of HOME. \nThey have a large variety of seafood and meat here. their stuff tends to run out later on the day so its best to go shop earlier in the day.\nFresh fish. Fresh seafoods. Even live crabs and lobsters. Playing with the live crabs makes me happy.\nThere are fast food restaurants around the supermarket complex. Chowking, Red Ribbon and Jollibee.\nThey sell fresh bread right nextdoor, Valerio's bakery.\nOpen from 7am till midnight.\nClean and organized.\n\nHate: Parking.  They do have really huge parking space, but since it's one of the biggest Filipino supermarket in town, people do come here a lot!! So go off hours.\nThe distance on every registers are REALLY narrow. Even the shopping carts couldn't fit.\nThe meat counter can be overwhelming, esp the line for fish cleaning.\nThey can be a little too overpriced. You can find some of their exact stuff at Walmart or 99 Cents Store for about 2-3x cheaper.\n\nI love you more than I hate you, so I'll keep visiting.
