I felt like I was in another country when I walked in, for real.\nI came to do a full grocery trip and kind of got culture shocked. I guess I wasn't prepared lol \nI probably looked out of place too! \nAnyway, I went for the $3.99 T bones, and all the other awesome sales, and ended up spending $200 there. I did have a whole fridge and pantry full after that. There are some pretty exquisite things there, like cactus pears, dragon fruit, and papaya as big as my head. I had a good time finding that stuff. \nAlso some of the best damn tortillas in town, I had to go back a second time just for more. One day I'll get brave and scout the deli and bakery areas.
