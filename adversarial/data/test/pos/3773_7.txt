Because of an unfortunate incident, the other location was permanently closed. I don't know if this place is a reopened version or just happens to be another location chain. But it gets 5 stars for the delicious food and the cheap price!\n\nThe extra large bowl is $7. Seriously? That's cheap. The regular bowls are $5.50+. Usually, pho places are $8 or more so you can see why this is awesome. Plus, their broth is full of flavor. One thing you should try is the stew #7 because it is packed with meat. The pho that I get is packed with meat. None of this 3 pieces of meat crap from the other restaurants. I still had meat in my bowl at the end of the meal. The amounts are generous which is another reason for the 5 stars.\n\nAppetizers are cheap too. Cheaper than a lot of places where they charge you like $5 for spring rolls. Here... $2. Yeah... \n\nI don't know about the service cuz I'm not really high maintenance but their service is ok. And the restaurant is medium clean. Oh well. I just came here for the awesome pho, anyway.
