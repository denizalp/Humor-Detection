We came to Tryst on a Thursday night and it was one of the worst experiences ever.\n\nMy friend from San Jose State has a bro from Beta Alpha Psi who previously worked as a bartender at Pure, but recently changed over to Tryst. She was working that night and happily put us on the guest list from my friend +11.\n\nWe headed over early, roughly 10pm-10:30pm to beat the rush. I'm not sure exactly what time because I was definitely absurdly plastered.\n\nWhat we encountered was pure unreasonableness and basically ruined my night.\n\nWe went straight to the guest list line with seven blonde chicks we had chopped it up with in line. I suspect the doorman we encountered was racist. because the males in our group were predominately Asian. They let the seven girls in ahead of us, and immediately the door man with the clipboard in the bottom stops us and tells us we had to pay. We insist that we are the guest list with those girls, and he says \"I'm sorry, I don't care if you brought 20 girls and had 1 guy - the 1 guy is still paying $30 cover charge\".\n\nMy friend tries to reason with the guy, even shows us our room key from Wynn. Clubs in Vegas NEVER reject people or ask for cover if they stay at the actual hotel. Well, this jerk did!\n\nWe stormed upstairs to the front of the line, and talked to another promoter and explained our situation. He said I'm very sorry, and worked out a deal with us that only two of us would have to pay cover. We figured being $60 in the hole for four guys and my girlfriend was no big deal - we'd be homies and split the cost between us all or perhaps buy each other drinks.\n\nSo we come down with those comps in hand, and hand it to the door man downstairs. He takes it away and says \"I don't care what strings you've pulled, you guys are ALL paying cover\". I blew up, asked to see his manager. He said the manager will tell you the same thing, and is too busy to talk with us. I got his business card afterwards, and we all left in a bad mood.\n\nI never thought I would feel so violated in my life. Tryst apparently hates Asian people and doesn't think seven attractive blonde women could be accompanied by a bunch of Asians.\n\nI refuse to ever come to Tryst again unless the door man gets on his hands and knees, apologizes, and then is promptly fired. I have been so upset about this experience, I am highly considering filing some kind of complaint of racist treatment.\n\nIf you are a minority, especially Asian please take your business elsewhere!
