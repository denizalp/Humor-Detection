I wanted to like this place, because of the friendly service, the tablet based ordering system and all the accoutrements to keep someone clean while eating messy food (gloves and a bib). \n\nUnfortunately my Cajun chicken and shrimp sandwich was rather mediocre and overly spiced, and my fries were just terrible. \n\nServing soup in a takeout container with plastic cutlery doesn't really make you feel special, and I cut my mouth on the spoon. \n\nI will give this place one more chance, to have their shrimp with corn on the cob, which comes in a plastic bag (?).
