I love this shop! The store's inventory is filled with very different cool refurbished, recycled and reusable items.  Forget the preconceived notions about second hand furniture, the stuff at UFO are pretty unique! I love the antique radios that have been converted into mood lamps, the illuminating spaceship sofa and other eye catching refurbished urban pieces . \nI could spend hours here just browsing. It's really nice to see that stores like this exist. I'm a big fan of Ready-Made Magazine and DIY books, so I love checking out shops like UFO.\nI bought an art deco oil lamp at this store as a house warming present for my sweet mom. I loved it and I'm sure she will too. The prices are definitely affordable and the items are definitely one of a kind.\nThe owner Leonardo is very personable, creative and very welcoming. I was inspired by some of the pieces in his store and seriously want to take the sewing classes that they offer. \nThe Om Boy bags are fabulous! I want to make one of those. \nCheck out this cool store. UFO is filled with treasure trove of seriously good stuff.\n\n\n                      _.-'~~~~'-._\n                .-~  \\__\/  \\__\/ ~-.         .\n               .-~   (oo)  (oo)    ~-.\n            (____\/~~\\   \/~~\\____)\n        _.-~`                             `~-._\n        \/O=O=O=O=O=O=O=O=O\\\n          \\__________________\/\n                     \\x x x x x x\/\n                  \\x_x_x_x_x_x\/\n\n\n      \"Earthlings...Buy Recycled!\"
