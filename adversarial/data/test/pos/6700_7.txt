My parents and I had to go to Holt's to pick up some ordered items. We arrived at Yorkdale around 5:30-ish and we were wondering whether we should eat first then shop, or vice versa. We decided to walk around first as Milestone's wouldn't be busy...after all, it was Tuesday!\n\nWRONG! This place was packed. We were there around 6pm and there was a line at the door. When my dad mentioned we were three, the manager said in a voice \"we have space for you\" as if the favour was a great one being done for us. We were put, in my opinion, the shit-e table - the one table that is in an awkward space close to the kitchen, where LOTS of people walk by, and placed along some wall where obviously they just wanted to put a table to fill up some space.\n\nMy dad was really looking forward to having Milestone's Seabass, but unfortunately, our waitress informed us that the Seabass and Cod dishes were gone. We promptly ordered the Mushroom soup (yum), I had the Meatloaf (juicy) and both my parents had the lighter cut prime beef. Done to their request of Medium Rare.\n\nThis restaurant was not calm or romantic in any way. It's a very hustle and bustle experience. One thing for sure, their kitchen staff are en pointe. We finished our entire meal in 30 minutes. Our appetizers came before the wine. We ordered the Chianti and waited...and waited...Our waitress informed us that the Chianti was no longer on their 'new' menu, to which she offered me to look and order again. The menu I got was exactly the same menu with the Chianti...oh well, not every waitress can be creative with excuses. \n\nBy the time our mains arrived, we just got our wine. This Milestone's 9oz serving was HUGE. We didn't feel like dessert as it just seemed they wanted guests in and out. When we left 45 minutes after being seated, there was still a huge line.\n\nOverall, Yorkdale lacks any special restaurants...only chains here: Moxie's, Milestone's, Picklebarrel, yawn, yawn. So, I would never, EVER, come out here for the Milestone's. But when in Yorkdale, you just have to deal with. My favorite Milestone's is still the one near my home right at Yonge and Sheppard.\n\n16\/30
