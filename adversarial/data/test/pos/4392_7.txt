I had a $5 coupon in the mail so I was like what the heck. And is it next to Home Goods (one of my favie home decoration stores). I got to the store it is like a Famous Footwear with an auction going on. Most of the shoes are off brands and made cheaply. Then loudly over the speakers, they announce the specials for the moment. Felt like I was at the fair. I rather go to DSW if I am going to shop discount shoes.
