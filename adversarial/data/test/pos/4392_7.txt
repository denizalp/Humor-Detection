Tomo, for me, stands out as one of the better upscale sushi restaurants in Richmond Hill. The quality of their sushi is consistently good. The portions are small in contrast to other places but the ingredients they use are of substantially higher quality. Also they cut their fish quite thick and their rolls are pretty large. \n\nI like their lunch specials and bento boxes. For example, \"Lunch Special A\" is $10 and gives you 11 pieces (assorted salmon and tuna) with a soup and salad. The presentation is another thing I like about Tomo's sushi. It's something you miss out on with the AYCEs.
