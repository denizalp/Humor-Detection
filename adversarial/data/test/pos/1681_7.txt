A large group of us were meeting for lunch.  This was the right place to do it!  Great service with an abundance of food!\n\nWith a large group you never really know how the waiter will handle things.  Luckily we had a great guy who really made it welcoming for each and every one of us.  He made it a point to make a personal experience while you were dining.  It was wonderful.  \n\nOur table shared some Queso with Chorizo to start.  It's served with tortilla chips as well as pita bread. Rich in flavor and great to share.  I would definitely add the chorizo every time. Our turkey sandwich was great.  The swiss & fontina cheese accompanied with the avocado and jalape√±o spread made this sandwich so delightful!  A turkey sandwich with a little kick is always good!  The BBQ chicken pizza was good but nothing over the top. I would suggest ordering one of their other pizzas or menu items.\n\nWe enjoyed a great lunch with great service.  Thanks Yard House!
