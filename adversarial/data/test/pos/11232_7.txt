It was Sunday in America, our nieces had packed up and headed back to their respective parents (fueled by a hypergolic combination of maple syrup and chocolate leftover from Easter...I have no idea how they got their little hands on all that sugar and chocolate) and the Beautiful Carin and I were, once again, free birds!\n\nhttp:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ca67ff\n\nWe decided a celebration was in order...we love our nieces and nephews, make no mistake (in fact, \"Auntie Carin\" is a family legend...the good kind) but it's always good to rev the kids up and then send them back to their mommies and daddies...kind of a practice session for when we have grandkids.\n\nAfter everyone was gone, we decided a big ol' breakfast\/brunchy meal was in order and since I had a Groupon for Saddle Ranch...well, you see where this is headed, don't you?\n\nThe joint was really jumpin'...I mean for a lazy Sunday in America, it was really going strong...we soon found out why...\"Babes on Bulls\"...adorable young ladies, in the fullest bloom of babehood were going to be riding the bull, while wearing very little in the way of clothing!\n\nIs there a better way to spend a lazy Sunday morning\/early afternoon than eating too much, having a few cocktails and watching live softcore?\n\nI don't think so, either!\n\nBabes on Bulls was a charity event...I have no idea what the charity was, but Carin and I donated, anyway...if only because the name of the event reminded me of the last great cinematic feature I saw...I think the movie was called \"Babes on Bob\"...there was a little riding going on in that movie, too!\n\nA huge and pretty tasty breakfast of steak and eggs, hash browns, biscuits and half a six pack of Devilish Something Bloody Mary's later, I was ready for the show\n\nAnd what a nice little show...Babes rode the mechanical Bull...lot's of \"yee-haw's\"...lots of jiggling...lots of hootin' and hollerin' from the crowd...in short, pretty much exactly what you expect when you walk into SRCH!\n\nSure, there are better breakfasts around...even some within my walking radius...but...SRCH is pretty decent  grub and better than average drinks and service (I mean, these people are always smiling and friendly) and ...\"Babes on Bulls\"...I mean come on!
