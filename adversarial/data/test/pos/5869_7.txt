Yankee alert!\n\nYes, I am American, and in my short trip to Canada, I could never get used to the fact that Canadian bars are packed with people as young as eighteen.\n\nRegardless, I took a look at this establishment from the sidewalk and thought, \"This is a bar??!!  No way!!\"  I love how this little yellow house stands nonchalantly amidst the massive skyscrapers.\n\nSIDE NOTE: This place is also the bar equivalent of my FAVOURITE cafe in Portland.  (See my review here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/rimsky-korsakoffee-house-portland#hrid:kMZBNKqWmvMKYA_JWd9vew)  If you are ever in Portland, I highly, highly recommend that you visit.\n\nUnfortunately, my party made this wonderful place the last stop of the night, so I can't even remember what I had to drink.  All I can remember is that it was very large and Canadian...\n\nGet your thoughts out of the gutter!\n\nIt was a Wild Rose Velvet Fog, and it was delicious!  My friends and I spent quite a bit of time there and I enjoyed every hipster-y, rustic, eclectic moment.\n\nBravo, Hop-in-Brew!
