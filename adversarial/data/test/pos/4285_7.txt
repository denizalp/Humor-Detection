I've been craving so much junk food this week but I was too lazy to get out the house. I ended up searching for local restaurants that delivered where I lived and found this one. \n\nI ordered poutine and a sundae with it and was relieved to hear my doorbell ring exactly 36 minutes later. Bonus for their punctuality! Then I tasted my poutine, and damn, was it good (especially while watching a movie).\n\nAll was good, except that the second time I ordered something (fettucini carbonara), the meal was a bit too thick. Other than that, my experience was pretty much good!
