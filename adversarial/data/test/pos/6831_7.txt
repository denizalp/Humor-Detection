Met with a longtime friend for brunch and coffee and a good catchup session.  I had the breakfast sandwich, and a cappuccino, my friend had a mocha.  I wasn't very impressed by the food. I did enjoy the barista creating a pumpkin in my coffee foam and writing Boo! So cute! Ahhh what can i say, it's the little things.  I definitely will give their menu a couple more tries. I love the outdoor space although the indoor seating is not cozy at all.  Wooden tables and chairs and very high vaulted ceilings make the place feel a bit impersonal.  Still want to like Madison Sourdough, though.
