Second time around, XS has lost its magic.  For me, anyways.\n\nDJ still sucks.  If you just play what people like, it'll keep them on the dance floor.  Hrm, maybe it's a strategy to play bad music so it gets people OFF the dance floor and towards the bar...\n\nThe whole area (indoor, outdoor, pool, restrooms) is packed to capacity.  Tables are sold out months in advance.  Guest list and general admission line is long, but it does move rather quickly.  I mean, they do want that $50 per guy.\n\nThe girls got to dance in the pool.  That was pretty cool, especially since our heels were so high and everywhere else in the club we were being herded like circus animals by the crowd.  I ran into a friend but couldn't talk because we were being crowd surfed in different directions.\n\nMaybe I'm just getting too old for this.
