2nd time here and it was just  okay. \nOur server Keefe was polite and provided good service but was spread too thin on this busy Saturday lunch crowd. They didn't seem to have enough staff to fill waters, offer more chips and salsa. We waited so long for everything especially our meals.\n\nTwo orders for cheese crisps were ordered and one was so incredible greasy that it needed to be taken away as it made my daughter sick.  She also ordered kids chicken strips and the had an unusual breading and a terrible taste.\n\nWe informed our server and he was very apologetic and offered to remove both items from our bill. Just disappointed this time around. The food seemed to be just tossed on plates and the presentabilty was lacking. May give another try as their reviews are very good and maybe were having an off day. However I appreciate consistency and expect the same meal to always be the same.
