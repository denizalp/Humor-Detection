I bought my tickets on Vegas.com, so I paid more than I should have, apparently!!! Dammit!\n\nI also thought this was a burlesque show, not a musical comedy. I hate musicals. I have to say, I was disappointed overall, because I was thinking this would be less of a stage show and more of a casual lounge-type environment... instead it was bench seating in a narrow theater. It was also lots of singing and barely any boobs. \n\nMoral of this yelp story: If you, like other yelpers, apparently, know what to expect (comedy, singing, very little boobies and very few glimpses of them) and you still want to attend this show, you will like it more than I did.
