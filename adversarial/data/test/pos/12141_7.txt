Road Trip\nSummer 2016\n\nOff to Adventuredome! Woot Woot! \n\nI toyed with the idea of buying my nephews single tickets for $6 so they could take turns accompanying my toddler (she was too small to ride by herself), but it was just easier and cheaper to buy the All Day Ride Pass for the two of us. Plus, I had a $l0 discount for staying at Circus Circus. It was worth it since she wanted to go on the rides over and over and over again. Too bad my nephews and I couldn't take turns wearing the wristband. It gets tedious riding the damn carousel fifty times! \n\nAnd the Ferris Wheel. \n\nAnd the Bus Ride. \n\nAnd the Road Runner. \n\nAnd the Jr. Roller Coaster. \n\nHaving a two year old in tow is a completely different adventure! Gone are the days of drinking all day and partying all night in Vegas. It's all about my little girl now and I have no problem with that. She had a fantastic time and her facial expressions while on the rides were delightfully amusing! The best part?!?!? She slept for 12 hours afterwards and I got to sleep in until 9 AM. Yep, the All Day Pass was totally worth it!\n\nTotal: $39.90
