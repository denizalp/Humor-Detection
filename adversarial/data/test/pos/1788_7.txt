This place is a joke. Their fire alarm goes off at midnight with no maintenance to reset it, the fire department cant do anything, their parking situation is basically a free for all. Cant wait for my lease to end so i can live comfortably in my car by a freeway because that would be an upgrade from this. I understand that for the price we pay we shouldn't expect much but this place just looks \"decent\" at sight. Save yourself the trouble and go live anywhere else but here. The problems are brought upto management but all you get back is a \"i know... we're working on it\" but nothing ever changes.  Oh and they seem to have a main water pipe issue about once a month that forces them to cut the water for the day and all you get is a last minute warning. Atleast the staff isnt as bad as they were at first, they pretend to care enough to leave a notice on the doors about robberies and burglaries that happen inside the \"gated secured community\"... and the gate doesnt work half the time. Our AC unit stopped working during the peak of summer and we had wait a few days for it to be fixed,our vintage 1920s refrigerator makes a weird continuous buzzing noise 24\/7 and last but definitely not least, our water heater burned out and we were left with freezing cold water during winter until they brought up a new one. I give them 1 star because they had a water heater already to go and we only waited overnight for our hot water.
