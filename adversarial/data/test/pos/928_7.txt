If you've never been in a Michael's, the interior is a throwback to nostalgia, with shiny vinyl booths, neon signs, and old coke machine. Retro poster boards adorn throughout reminiscent of good ole times, think Grease era, sharing a fountain soda pop with your sweetheart.\n\nThe facade of the happiness projected on the menu boards are lost in the employees. One, which was working frantically to fill the drive-thru order, and the younger, front register employee, who did not seem at all thrilled about being there.\n\nThe flavors are listed on a magic eraser board, today was vanilla, chocolate, and flavor of the day, chocolate cherry torte. We ordered two single scoop waffle cones ($4.21 each) of the chocolate and flavor of the day.  \n\nI was expecting chocolate custard with cherry pieces for the FOD, but instead it was vanilla custard, with chocolate cake  and maraschino cherry mixed in. It was delightful! Really rich and creamy, and I loved getting chunks of the cake with almost each bite. The chocolate custard was also velvety smooth.\n\nWe liked the FOD so much we wanted to take one home. I asked if I could have another single waffle cone of the FOD, but placed in a dish so I could carry it. Instead, they just gave me a plastic cup filled with the custard, no waffle cone. *waaa*
