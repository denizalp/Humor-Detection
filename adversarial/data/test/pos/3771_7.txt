I just went into Brews Brothers and I will never go back. Dickhead at the register didn't think to greet me when I entered but preferred to continue reading his book (strike one). Next, Dickhead (short white hair in his late 50's BTW) when asked about the prices for growlers barely looked up from his book only to grunt the almost intelligible words \"prices are on the whiteboard\" (and thats 's strike two AND three). GREAT customer service, Dickhead. How is this place in business with that type of SH!T service. Oh yeah...forgot to mention...they barely serve food. Last I checked with the liquor board that's a violation of their license agreement. Last thing (and something else I may have overlooked if Dickhead didn't act like his nickname)...it smelled like rotting fish in there.. So there you have it...if you want to be treated like crap by Dickhead in a sterile store with NO style and overpriced beer that also happens to smell like bad fish...go to Brews Brothers! Otherwise...go ANYWHERE else.
