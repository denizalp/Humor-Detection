I have visited the shop two times as I purchased several of their RDeals coupons. The coupon clearly states that if ordering more than a dozen cupcakes to call ahead at least 24 hours. I did, and was told by the owner \"no need to order, just walk in and choose from what we have\" even though I told her I have several RDeals coupons. I went in on a Saturday but the selection of cupcakes was poor. They did have several types of macaroons and they were very good. I took a dozen macaroons and a dozen cupcakes, they only had red velvet and chocolate chip left. The cupcakes weren't too sweet and I liked the frosting, however I was disappointed by the small selection. Second time I went, they were running low on macaroons and didn't even have a dozen cupcakes left, 4 hours prior to closing time. In fact only 8 cupcakes  were left as the person who was in line ahead of me had called ahead that morning and put aside 2 dozen cupcakes. Apparently you can't order ahead but you can call the day of and have them put the cupcakes aside for you. Today, I decided to do that. I called ahead and asked for a dozen cupcakes, of any flavour, to be put aside. I was told \"no, we don't ever do that\". When I explained that 3 weeks ago that is what I was told when I was in the store and only got 8 cupcakes, the person who had answered the phone again said \"no, we never do that, there is only 2 of us working and we just don't do that. We only made 1.5 dozen for today, so obviously I can't put any aside for you\". I told her I was told by the owner's mother last time I was in to just call the day of.  She then put me on hold for several minutes, and then I heard someone release the hold button and hang up the phone. I was very disappointed by the service I received. I also find it very hard to believe that only 1.5 dozen cupcakes were made for a Saturday. Out of the 8 cupcakes I got last time, 3 of them had to be taken out of the back by the lovely lady who was working in the shop so that we don't go home without any cupcakes when we drove in from Mississauga. Once we got home, those 3 cupcakes were still frozen. I was very confused by this since they are supposed to be baked fresh.
