The best. \nI ventured out here because Kent told me to! It was totally worth it, I met the owners who are charming and passionate. I ate a few things I had never tried before and was very surprised, I really enjoyed everything I ate.\n\n The space was very clean and had an amazing energy, cool communal tables, but I find sitting at the bar is always best! \n\nThe waitress was especially great!\n\nIll be back soon!
