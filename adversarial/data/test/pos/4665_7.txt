I kind of love Bailey's. Its hole in the wall divey with karaoke on the reg. Good song book selection and kick ass patrons. \n\nPool tables are always in use. Few bikers. Lots of regular folk. Haven't crossed paths with the forespoken meth heads. \n\nThey don't have a kitchen that I know of but they have pretzels behind the bar and sometimes pizza deliveries are made from what I've seen in the past. But what do I know? I'm usually drunk singing karaoke and enjoying myself. Holler at me, we'll go and find out for sure.
