I'll have to admit I'm one of those people who don't really get Trader Joe's.  But then, we do most of our (grocery) shopping at Aldi, and we don't really care about what we eat.  Sue us.\n\nThey do have some interesting product - where else are you going to find dark chocolate-covered edamame? - but then again, how often are you really going to need all of those things?  I mean, sure, I buy those things because I'm trying to find something to give to our son that he won't eat (he says he'll eat anything chocolate, and I'm determined to find something he won't).\n\nI'd have to agree that the cheese selection isn't that great, and since we already don't visit Harris Teeter, and find only a rare occasion to go to somewhere like Dean and Deluca, it's a nice diversion, but really?\n\nI guess it just comes down to what you eat, and we don't really eat that much that requires a trip to TJ's.  What they do have is cool, but I don't know that it's cool enough to require a visit there.  Sorry.
