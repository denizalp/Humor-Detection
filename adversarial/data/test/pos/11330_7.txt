WHO: Bring your boyfriends, girlfriends, nieces, and mamas for an amazing Tea Time!\n\nWHERE: Located at the top of the Mandarin Oriental in the City Center. \n\nWHEN: They are open from 10am-10pm, but Tea Service is from 2-5pm daily.\n\nWHAT: In all of my 24 years of being alive, I have never gotten the pleasure of having a TEA PARTY. So apparently my friend loves having tea parties, and decided to make reservations for my first tea party EVER! \n\nAs we walked towards the Mandarin Oriental, went inside and sat in the elevator rising up towards the Tea Lounge, my heart skipped 10 beats due to excitement. I was definitely an excited girl that day!\n\nWe were seated by the window overlooking the strip (that day they had part of the strip closed off for a while because the Nascar were doing a pre-show... Randomly we got to see the Nascar drift and all that jazz! Lol). Mary Anne was our server, and she actually recognized my friend since he comes here so much, Lol. He is definitely popular! Hahaha! She was such a sweetheart and explained the new temporary additions to the menu for winter. We ended up getting the Classic English Afternoon Tea set up, which came with several wonderful snacks and the choice of any tea in the menu.\n\nI chose the Lychee Organic Green Tea, and my friend chose the Peach Tea, which were both very calm and soothing! Mary Anne brought us honey and milk for our tea, along with our small little treats!\n\nAbout the treats, they were all really amazing, but I never knew how much the scones at starbucks and any other coffee shop were INCOMPARABLE to their scones here! They were fresh out of the over, and tasted absolutely WONDERFUL with the jellies they brought out!! I NEED MORE SCONES!!\n\nTREATS:\nSmoked salmon & cucumber with watercress spread- YES!\nCreamy deviled egg in a shell with Paleta Iberico & lavash\nTartlet of mango with foie gras mousse & spice bread crisp- YES!\nBlack forest ham sandwich- YES!\nSignature scones with imported Devonshire clotted cream and Chef Philippe's house made marmalades and jams- YES!\nRandom assortment of Tea pastries- YES!\n\nThe rest of the goodies were on point! I ordered an extra Passion Fruit Macaron... BEST I'VE EVER HAD! They change some of the treats every 2 weeks to a month, so I will definitely come back next month! YES!!\n\nRANDOM NOTE: Make reservations just incase! =)\n\nI wish and hope you all have the experience of your first Tea Party! PINKY'S UP!
