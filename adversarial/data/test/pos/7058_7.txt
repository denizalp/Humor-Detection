I would actually rate this place a 3.5.  I went there with a group of friend late on a Friday night and was surprised to see that the place was mostly empty.  The atmosphere was a contemporary Asian theme.\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely helpful in describing the menu. This was a nice place to enjoy some $5 appetizers late at night.  Everything we tried was amazing from the goyza to the tutu curry.  I look forward to visiting again during earlier hours to get the full dining experience.
