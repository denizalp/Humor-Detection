I have now been to Embers twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. Dinner was more of a two star really. Food was ok, but I've definitely had better. My steak was way overpriced for what I got, and it was corn-fed, not grass-fed. \nWhat clinched the one star for me was the brunch. First off, the coffee was very bitter and is probably the first time I've had to add milk to restaurant coffee, I always drink coffee black. Then my fianc√© and I ordered bacon-wrapped dates and crunchy beef tacos - both were ok. What really took home the grand prize for bad food was my omelet that I ordered. It was the Chorizo and Piquillo Pepper Omelet which had no seasoning\/salt added to it whatsoever and the chorizo was flat tasting. They top it with chimichurri - which caused me to gag. With the omelet that was provided to me, this sauce couldn't have gone any worse with it. I will not return to this place again.
