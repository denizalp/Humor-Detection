I love ordering their food Thai-Hot (thats the hottest you can get here). If you like you're food spicy, you can't go wrong. Their pre-meal salads; which come with every dine-in meal, has an awesome salad dressing. They also sell their salad dressing for ($5) to take home. I forget how many oz. they said it was. I think its close to 12 or 16, but don't quote me on it. Every meal seems to come with a slice of fresh cut watermellon.  The watermellon is a nice refreshing pre or post meal snack and also light on the added calories; although the rest of the meal may not be.\n\nMy favorite dish is their garlic dish; either rice or noodle, ive had it with chicken and tofu before. The tofu is prepared in such a way that it has a crispy outside and a buttery inside. I don't think that I've ever ordered a tofu dish before and thought \"I might order this again some time.\" \n\nTheir lunch meals will cost you about $10-$11 after tax + tip, so I don't visit all the time, but they are a great choice if you can't stop thinking about thai food and you're in the midtown area near central ave and thomas.
