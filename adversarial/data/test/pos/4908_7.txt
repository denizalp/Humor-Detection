I stopped into Festival about a week after it opened to scope it out and grab a couple of things to tide me over for a couple of days. Coming from the direction of the capitol I turned at the light before Festival and ended up parking on the street behind the building. I missed the tiny sign that points to parking in the ramp; it's more or less across the street from where you would pull in the other direction to get to Cargo Coffee's ramp and drive-thru. \n\nWe entered into the liquor store and it's pretty expansive considering the overall size of the store. We didn't do too much browsing in that section, but we did check out the growler station (pours between $15-20 + $5 with the jug). That ends up being $3-5 per glass, if you're curious. \n\nFirst stop was the deli. They have touch screens to take a number and people seemed to be really confused by this. Everything was attractively arranged and the staff seemed eager to help. There are several plastic to-go containers under the circular deli case filled with deli goods (salads, deli meat, etc.) in varying weights. Nice if there's a line or you're there when the counter isn't staffed. The area was crowded so I bailed pretty quick but I only noticed middle of the road brands like Hormel for the meat; I'll have to take a closer look on a future visit. \n\nThe bakery items looked amazing but I was disappointed by the muffin that I looped back for after working my way through the store. The bottom half was extremely dry and bordering on having a burnt flavor. I'm not completely ruling them out because it's a new store, new staff, new ovens - it'll probably take some time go get the bake times just right. The hamburger buns I bought were fine, but they get bonus points for being sold individually. I tend to eat veggie burgers so at most I need half a package of buns, and often only two as veggie burgers tend to be put in pairs so I'll eat it for two days then move on to something else. \n\nThe produce aisle was packed with moms with their teenagers so I moved right past that for this trip. \n\nI had a bit of a time finding soy milk - it's not in the dairy section but the natural foods aisle.\n\nRandom price checks of personal staples were reasonable, and sometimes surprisingly low: \n- Soy milk ~$3.50\n- Boca Burgers ~$3.50\n- Cereal was average with some good sales\n- Yogurt was a little higher but also evened out by sales like ~$2 Noosa\n\nRandom good things:\n- Tiny carts for those of us who don't mega shop for multiple people\n- Resealable bags - no knotting or twist tying or fighting to keep food fresh \n- Self-checkout both at the deli for grab & go and near the exit to the garage\n\nOverall I'm glad to have a full-service, non-price-gouging store in my neighborhood. I'll always wish it was a Metro Market (or, sweet lord, a Wegman's - a girl can dream), and I'm sure I'll become a regular customer since it doesn't involve taking a drive around the lake or through campus to get there.
