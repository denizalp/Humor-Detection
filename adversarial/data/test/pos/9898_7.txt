Well, friends. I guess all good things must come to an end, and charge you ridiculous fees. Pull up a chair, and settle in. Here's my unfortunate, lengthy update: \n\nI have lived in Atkins Circle since February 2013. I had three different apartments in that time, and my last review was written a mere 8 months into my lease. I'm finally growing up, and moving out, and wanted to sum up my time there for you. \n\nI've always been an advocate for Atkins. The neighbors are mostly friendly, kids and dogs everywhere, pretty and spacious apartments, depending on the layout you choose. I still agree with all of that, however, things have changed in the last almost 5 years and I wanted to let you know. I didn't have much trouble at first. I ran into your regular sketchy neighbors, and had my share of loud music and cigarette butts on the sidewalk, but nothing too outrageous. \n\nAfter my first 2 years here, they got rid of the security deposits. Which, really, is fine - they reimbursed my security deposit while I lived there. One man got evicted from his apartment, and started living in the upstairs section of the fitness center. They only found him because he got into a drunk fight and started stumbling and bleeding around the neighborhood. \n\nOn my third year here, I moved into a smaller apartment. It was beautiful, spacious, and cheaper rent. Two weeks in to that apartment, one of the water pipes in my wall burst. Water flooded the apartment, and made me a hotel resident for about 2 weeks - thank goodness for renter's insurance! Turns out, Atkins Circle had never insulated their water pipes, and this started to happen all over the neighborhood. Insurance put me (and a ton of my neighbors) up at the nearby hotel, we had buffet breakfast most mornings and wondered if we'd ever get back into our building. We didn't. Within those two weeks that I was at an apartment, and my dog was at doggy daycare - I had to hire movers because my apartment was no longer habitable. Atkins took me on tours of every apartment they had available and I eventually settled on one similar to the one that had flooded. My movers moved me one building over, and I once again was settled and settling for my life at Atkins. Later in this year, I ran into one of the front office staff members at a local bar. She was drunk and rowdy, threatened to fight me, physically assaulted a friend of mine, and had to be ushered to her friend's car (and banned from the bar). It look a lot of emails and reports, but eventually this staff member was fired. I had to repeatedly enforce the idea that I did not feel safe with an aggressive drunk having key access to my apartment. \n\nYear 4. April of 2017. I work really hard for my busy job, especially in the spring. So I went to bed around 10pm, and heard gunshots. On my block, a man shot his Uber driver. From my window I watched the car slam into reverse and watched the shooter go to his car and then heard him go into his apartment, right next to mine. We shared a few walls, and I could hear him (thin walls) on the cell phone while the police were looking for him. Police eventually shut down the street, and started looking for the man. An officer with a rifle set up by the gazebo and pointed a gun at my building. At this point, my gun firing neighbor is asking someone on his phone what he should do as the police came up his stairway. I took my dog into my living room and tried to put as many walls in between myself and my gun wielding neighbor. The police eventually got him out of the apartment around 2am. I called the office first thing the next day, and none of the staff had heard about the incident. They eventually put out a memo reminding neighbors that the neighborhood is safe. \n\nI've stopped going to the neighborhood pools, because it's filled with people I don't know (& that I've never seen in the neighborhood). All of the dog friendly potty spots are filled with dog poop land mines. The \"dog park\" is dusty and no longer has grass, so every time we go in there my dog gets muddy & growled at, because no one registers their aggressive dogs either. The office has no idea how many dogs live in this neighborhood. I don't recognize more than three staff members (front office or maintenance staff) because their turnover rates are so high. My AC went out at least 6 times this summer. And finally, I put in my notice to move out. According to them, I was a day late on my 60 day notice, even though I had never gotten renewal paperwork. Upon moving out, they charged me $166 for trash removal, water, and month to month rent for the first two days of January (my lease was up on January 1st). All in all, Atkins served its purpose; I had housing and was never in direct danger that police weren't able to handle. I use to recommend living here to everyone, I no longer do. Thanks for reading my Atkins adventures. The only real good thing that came out of it was some friendships and discovering Buona Vita across the street.
