Finally, the temp has started to cool down, so we decided to take the kids to the zoo.  It wasn't our first time here, but our first time in years.  Its not a huge zoo, but big enough for us.  Taking the family to the zoo is not cheap.  Even with buy one get one free coupons.  It still came out to $46.  I did purchase a drink inside, the biggest one was $4, which isn't too bad.   You do have to pay for ice if you want an extra cup of it though.  \n\nI do appreciate that the kids are actually able to see the animals since the enclosures aren't too big, but I do worry that they are cramped.  You see certain animals that are known for their running speed, but can't run anywhere in the enclosure that they are in all day.  Do they get to run freely after hours every once in a while?\n\nThe kids really enjoyed feeding the giraffes.  It will cost you about 50 cents to buy food.   The giraffes are my favorite part too.  Do they have elephants and gorillas, or did we just miss them?\n\nThis was our first time seeing the aquarium.  It's a pretty nice aquarium.  We had a chance to see a lot of interesting fish.  The kids spent most of their times with the stingrays.  You are allowed to touch them, but only with two fingers.  It was a nice end to our day.  \nI'll be back...with a coupon, of course.
