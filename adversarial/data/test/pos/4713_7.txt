My family and I went to brunch there on Sunday late morning. The place was pretty empty except for the bar that was full. Nice enough place. Been here for late night but never for Brunch. Well the food took almost 40 minutes to come out. The bacon was mooing. It was disgusting. I almost had to tackle the waiter to get his attention. Very very expensive for a I don't really care attitude by all who work there.
