Dr. Eric Auslander is not a mere chiropractor.\n\nHe is a mad, mirthful carnival barker of health and wellness. He will extol to you the virtues of a good neck snapping. He is a diamond of comedy, and he is always \"on\" as they say in the biz. \n\nA quirk of happenstance caused me to accompany Kay to one of her routine chiropractic adjustments. After seeing Dr. Auslander, a man with the personality  of a stand-up funnyman, interact with his patients, I was soon making an appointment myself, becoming known The Man Who Fell Off The Table upon my initial visit. \n\nYes, Dr. Auslander told me to flip one way, and I flipped the opposite way for some reason. It had been a long, grueling, exhausting day, my circuits having been fried. That's my excuse. \n\n\"Fall down go boom,\" he said invoking Robin Williams. \"That's never happened before! Not in all my 20 years of practice!\" \n\n\n\n\n                                Welcome To Dr. Eric's House Of Fun\n\n*Snap\" \n\n\"Have you listened to that Cults song I told you about yet? Huh?\"\n\n*Pop*\n\n\"No, not THE Cult. I know you've seen those guys. You WOULD see THOSE guys.  You told me. Cults. I'm talkin' about Cults. Indy pop.\"\n\n*Slam*\n\n\"C'mon man, broaden your horizons.\"\n\n*Thump*\n\n\"You're a nut. Turn this way.\"\n\n*Crack*\n\n\"Don't 'ooof!' me. It's not like this is your first visit.\"\n\n*Whirr*\n\n\"Get up outta there, Frankenstein,\" Dr. Auslander will say when I jokingly put my arms out in front of me as the table rises. \n\nSuch is Eric's stage banter. \n\nI've been visiting Mt. Lebanon Chiropractic for over a month now, and I already have more stamina, energy, and freedom of movement than I have in many years. The staff is friendly, the office itself is technologically up-to-date, and once you are thoroughly, rigorously screened, each appointment goes by quickly with minimal wait times. The roller beds and electric\/heat stimulation are so luxurious, one might as well be at a spa. \n\nIf you're feeling your age in the wrong way, you may want to consider a visit to Mt. Lebanon Chiropractic for a tune-up. Patients from all generational groups are welcome, so don't be surprised if you find yourself sitting between a fifty-something in a business suit and a 16 year-old with piercings and an Avenged Sevenfold t-shirt on. \n\nP.S. Biocraniopathy, massages, and oxygen treatments are also offered by Mt. Lebanon Chiropractic. \n\nP.P.S. Most health insurance plans are accepted.
