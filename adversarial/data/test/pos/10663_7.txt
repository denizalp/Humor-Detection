Happy Birthday and don't bring your kids! For my 40th my hubby took me & our kids to dinner. We've been to Passion8 several times but not w\/our kids.  It was 5pm on a Thurs and the restaurant was empty. Our kids looked at the menu & said is there anything simpler to eat?  I asked the hostess. She said yes, of course. Your waitress will tell you about it. The waitress asked how old the kids were. Then she said they'd have to eat off the adult menu and the chef would make modifications. Things got worse from there. The rest of the meal we were treated like 2nd class citizens, especially after the suits came in. Our waitress just disappeared. The kids didn't like the food and their meals were not modified. The hostess asked us if we wanted anything else 20 minutes after dinner.  We said we would like to order dessert.  She sent the waitress over. No one wished me a happy bday when the dessert came out . They just slapped it on the table. My husband looked shocked. He had been clear about it being my birthday and included it in the reservation. He wanted it to be special for me. When the check came, the waitress said, Oh and by the way, Happy Bday. She said it in a monotone\/blunt way and we did not feel welcome. Worst Bday ever! I felt so bad for my husband.  He tried so hard and I love him for it!
