Legitimate NYC pizza.  \n\nEven the workers have a Brooklyn accent, AND they flip their pizzas in front of you...Old school.  \n\nOrdered a large white pie with artichoke hearts, pepperoni, ricotta cheese and mushrooms.  Freakin amazing.  Everything from the crust to the toppings was delicious.  \n\nHad their seasonal blueberry cobbler cheesecake, best cheesecake I have EVER had in my life, which is a tie for first with Harriet's in Los Angeles.  Cheesecake factory needs to step it up if you ask me.  \n\nWill definitely be frequenting this spot.
