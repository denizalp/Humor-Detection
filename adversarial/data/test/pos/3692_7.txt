1 star.\n\nI have heard so much about this place. I have been dying to check it out since moving into the neighborhood several months ago. Last night was the night where my friend and I finally got down there to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nWe never even got to eat the burger. Even though it was a bit busy last night, we stood and waited in front of the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign for almost 15 minutes without so much as an acknowledgement. I understand if you're busy, but at least let me know you see me and you're working on getting me in. Upon looking around the corner there were at least 2- 2 seater tables available, and nobody waiting behind us, so I don't understand the lag.\n\nAfter 15 minutes we were finally spoken to and told 5- 10 minutes. At that point I wasn't too optomistic that we would've been seated within 10 minutes, so we told the guy nevermind and went to Freddy's(see review, glad we went).\n\nWe had been trying to decide between trying this place or Freddys Steakburgers, as we wanted to try a new place. I chose BB. What a disappointment. Myabe one day I'll try to get in again sometime down the road. Maybe its just me, but if I'm willing to pay 10+ dollars for a burger, than service certainly matters, and this was not going to cut it.\n\nWhen and if I go in the future, I will update it accordingly. Until than, its that 1 lonley star.
