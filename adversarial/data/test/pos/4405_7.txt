I've been here a few times now and my final verdict is...it's A-ok.\n\nIt's a cute little cafe located in the same plaza as Einstein bagel, Taco Y Taco, Popped Popcorn. So, parking can be a pain sometimes. It's a small space, so you might have to wait if it's busy. I've been fortunate enough that I've never waited. \n\nAs for the food, it's your typical breakfast\/lunch joint that serves up your typical breakfast\/lunch food. Nothing special. There's your omelettes, skillets, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, etc. Nothing I've eaten here has been super OMG mind blowing. Like I said, it's very typical. Prices are on the lower end with no dish being over $15.\n\nFor the service, again nothing stellar. The servers we've encountered just looked like they were going through the motions. Not rude, but just enough friendliness to do their job. No smiles from anyone either. \n\nLike I said, it's ok for me, but this definitely wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast.
