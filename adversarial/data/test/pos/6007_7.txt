Keep in mind, as you read this review that it isn't so much the issue, but how it is handled...or not handled in this case. \n\nThis was communicated to Barro's on April 4, 2012 and as of today, April 10th I have not spoke to anyone regarding this situation.  I understand that mistakes happen but again, it's how the mistake is addressed that can make or break a customer.\n\nSurprise, AZ Location\nOrder 5730\n\nI just tried calling twice and was hung up once when trying to be put on hold and was on hold for over 5 minutes the second time.  That probably lends to my frustration at this point.\n\nI called in an order at 6:20pm and was told 20-25 minutes and I showed up at 6:45 and was told my pizza wasn't ready.  After waiting TWENTY FIVE minutes I went up to the girl and asked her to check on my order.  After running around, she found it in the warmer and it had been sitting there the entire time!!  She said she was sorry but the order was under Linda Miller, not Melinda Miller.  Really??  At what point do you look at the order and realize it's the SAME person?\n\nWe actually stopped going to Barro's last summer due to issues just like this and this was some kind of welcome back.  We live around the corner and I'm pretty sure you'd agree, I shouldn't have to heat up a luke warm pizza, I paid for a hot pizza.\n\nHopefully you can use this feedback and get your act together.
