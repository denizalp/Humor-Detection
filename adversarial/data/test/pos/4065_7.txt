I finally gave Short Leash another try.\n\nI was on my way to the airport one morning and needed to get some breakfast\/lunch.\n\nOriginally, I was planning on going to Matt's, but (of course) it was extremely busy and chaotic.\n\nSince Short Leash was only a few blocks away, I decided to give them a shot.\n\nWhat a mistake that was.\n\nFirst of all, why does it feel like they have no air conditioning?  I'm always so f**king hot in this place.  Blah.  When I'm eating food, I don't like to be sweating.\n\nI wanted to try a few of their breakfast items, so I chose their version of breakfast dogs, which is essentially brats\/sausages dipped in batter and deep fried.  \n\nThis dish came with a tiny thimble of maple syrup and a European espresso cup filled with fried, crispy home fries.  I didn't mind that they were nearly unrecognizable due to being overly fried.  They were seasoned well and adequately compensated for the miserable breakfast corn dog.  \n\nWhen I bit into the \"breakfast dog,\" it immediately began to separate into two unique meals: an unappealing and seemingly undercooked, pale brat\/sausage and a soft, pancake-like batter that had been deep fried until it loosely wrapped itself around said meat-on-a-stick.\n\nBlech.  They serve you two of these things for about $8.00.  I took a few bites and decided that the remainder should deservedly be tossed in the garbage.\n\nFor the second item, I chose their version of \"chicken and waffles,\" which is a misleading title, because it doesn't represent the traditional meal.\n\nInstead, Short Leash serves you a large, dense waffle that has been daintily topped with minuscule amounts of syrup and butter, sliced in four separate pieces, and arranged messily next to a fried habanero chicken sausage.\n\nWith this dish, I enjoyed the chicken sausage, though it was a little too spicy.  Why the hell would anyone think that it's a good idea to put habanero peppers inside a sausage?  Why not just keep things simple and flavorful?  When I'm eating breakfast, I don't want to feel like I am participating in a spicy foods contest.\n\nThe waffle was another story.  To put it bluntly, it was awful.  It was everything you don't want a waffle to be: thick, dense, heavy, rubbery...   It would have served as an excellent flotation device, because it didn't appear to be capable of soaking up ANY liquid, creating miniscule pools of butter and syrup on the surface.  Meanwhile, the waffle just smugly sat there on my plate, daring me to take another bite.  \n\nFortunately, I prevailed and resisted further attempts to digest this seat cushion.\n\nHonestly, folks, I don't know why you like this place.  Nothing about it is enjoyable, except for the cute waitress.\n\nIt's overpriced, the food is mediocre, and the interior temperature is always at an uncomfortable level.\n\nWhy keep going back here and continue giving this place rave reviews?  Obviously, I don't get it, but I'm not going to punish myself anymore.\n\nThese Dogs should definitely be kept on a Short Leash and not allowed to roam free, unleashing their disastrous culinary creations on unsuspecting patrons.\n\nA sign should be posted out front that reads: \"Beware of Dog.\"
