Getting on the guest list entails: still having to wait in line (granted it is a guest list line), free cover for ladies, and half price cover for the gents. A good plus for this joint is on Saturdays for about an hour (11pm-12am) there is an open vodka bar for the ladies. Holla! Let's be real though, they're not gonna be pouring Goose or Belvadere.  It's vodka from a bottle where the label is stickered on.  But hey after your fourth or fifth one...who can tell the difference..right? Haha. Music is good...but the dance floor gets PACKED!
