My favourite neighbourhood place!  I have been going here for years.  Peter and his wife are amazing people!  Pat (server) has been with the restaurant for over 30 years - from when Peter's dad and uncle owned the place.\n\nAll of the food is great with great portions and prices are reasonable.\n\nThis is my #1 go to place for meeting friends and family, having a night out, or just enjoying a good breakfast (all day if I wanted!).\n\nMy favourites:  Clubhouse sandwich, souvlaki dinner, breakfast.
