On the recommendation of my friend, I decided to check this place out.  He has been going to this place since it opened 14 years ago, and he swears that it is the best jerk chicken he has had.\n\nI introduced him to my favorite spot, the Ritz at Yonge & Carlton, which he quite enjoyed, but he said that he still liked his spot better.  Well, that to me was a challenge, and I had to try his spot.  The guy at the counter was super friendly, and asked in his Jamaican accent, ever so politely, if I liked my chicken \"a little spicy\".  A big smile burst across my face, and I said \"most definitely\", and asked him not to hold back on the \"pepper sauce\" (which my friend told me was an inside joke that he had going with the owner).\n\nNow the Jerk here is quite good.  It's very smokey, tender and tasty.  My mom tried a piece and wondered out loud how they get the pieces so tender and flavorful.  I definitely enjoyed the chicken, but will I say that it is better than my old standby, nope... not quite.  \n\nSo after trying the meal, I decided to discuss the finer points of Jerk Chicken with my friend.  We came to the conclusion that there may be two (or possibly more) styles of jerk chicken: the more barbeque-esque, juicy, fall of your bone (which the Ritz gets to perfection) and the more smokey, dry but still flavorful variety (which Negril seems to nail).  It was the only way we could see eye-to-eye.
