Duck Donuts was the biggest culinary disappointment of 2015 for me. Why am I giving them 4 stars then you ask? Because it's not them it's me. Unfortunately I am in the yeast risen donuts camp and I refuse to acknowledge cake donuts as a legitimate donut.\n\nThat said I still really enjoyed their fresh out of the fryer cake donuts. Though some of the glazes were a bit too sweet for me such as the maple glaze the salty toppings help curb some of that sugar. Their store employees are helpful and the place is clean and no nonsense. Get your donuts, get your coffee and get to work.\n\nA charming concept that may bring me back if I am ever in a donut emergency and there is no yeast risen donut option around.
