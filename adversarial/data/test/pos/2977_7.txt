YUM.  Seriously.  Delicious.  The pizza was very good (only the final comparison to Pizzeria Bianco did it in - I would recommend getting the wood-fired oven at least another 50 degrees hotter to really crisp and blacken the crust), the pasta I had was awesome, and the dessert was to die for.  Oh yum.   \n\nScottsdale location opens next week, apparently, at 90th St and Via Linda.  Yum.
