Talk about getting your coffee fix this is definitely the place to go. Forget the coffee chains like Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks. No comparison to Not Just Coffee. \n\nIt's like a coffee house right in the center of the public market. Chairs all around and so much fun to watch how they make each customers coffee. This place is hopping and busy that's for sure. It is one smooth cool operation here. Talk about efficiency.\n\nThe coffee is definitely, gourmet and strong too, We each had two different cups of coffee.\n\nThe Cappuccino with the pretty artwork on the frothy foam.\n\nWas inquiring if they made Vietnamese Coffee like the ones with condensed sweetened milk. The mentioned getting a Cortado which it came in a shot glass. That expresso shot kept me up for most of the night.\n\nWill definite be back to get my next coffee fix.
