Southpark residents were able to get an ABC store without the tacky red-and-white sign. And in a normal, brick building. How did that happen? I thought it was a requirement that our socialized liquor distribution service be marked with 6-foot high scarlet letters to warn decent, God-fearing people of the sin within. Yet this Southpark branch has avoided the eyesore. Such is the influence of wealth, I suppose.\n\nSpeaking of wealth, this ABC store has a shelf of scotches that are older than I am and cost more than my car. Phew, that's something. I spent a few moments gaping at this, which I think made the cashier nervous. She kept a close eye on me.\n\nBonus star for being so close to the Taj MaTeeter, where I can buy my ice, garnishes, mixers, and other sinful accoutrement.
