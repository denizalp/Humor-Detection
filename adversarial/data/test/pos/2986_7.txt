The design interior very interesting with all the pictures, design, and ornaments but still classic, cozy, and welcoming. The setting of the chair was set perfectly where you can still talking nicely even the restaurant was full. Perfect atmosphere for family, romantic dinner, or after work at the bar.\n\nThe foods were amazing! My favorite were the dumpling, Olive salad (or oliver? lol), and donut! I ordered drink Loaded Mule, that was my new crush drink, so smooth, citrusy, and fresh. \n\nThanks again Sonata for all the services plus all the goodies! I went home with happy tummy, would love to come back again, and YES would love to recommended this place!
