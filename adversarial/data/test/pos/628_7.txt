This was the worst club I've ever been to. First of all the male dancers are so aggressive. I walked into the room upstairs where they have male dancers. Within 1 minute I was approached by 5 dancers. Two of them pushed me into a chair and just started giving me a lap dancing. I said NO I don't want a dance I'm here with my friend it's her bachelorette party, the dance is for her. I kept telling them no and they wouldn't leave so about 30 seconds later I had to get up and walk away. They proceeded to follow me and harass me for money. This was outrageous! I wasn't able to even enjoy myself. They were bullies taking advantage of women through intimidation. On top of this their ATM is rigged to steal your money. Every time I tried to withdraw cash the machine would show an error message and charge me for a balance inquiry! Don't go here! Save your money for a better club! I'm pretty sure that all of there 4 and 5 star reviews are from their employees!
