Did you know that over the years Pittsburgh has gone through many transformations?  Each transformation included new shiny towers that now define our skyline.  One Oxford Centre came out of the city's second renaissance (or transformation).  It is an octagonal, aluminum and glass tower that rises to about 615ft. from the ground.  \n\nIt is one of the towers in Pittsburgh that most people overlook because everyone seems to think of only US Steel tower when they think of Pittsburgh.  It is a prominent figure in all those Mt. Washington pictures that your friends have to show you if they have visited the city.  It's basically the first tower that greets you when you take the Grant St. exit off the parkway.  It's always right there in your face, but kind of just sits back and watches you walk by it.\n\nInside you will obviously find the common office space that you will find in every other tower in the city.  Along with shops and restaurants at street level.  Attached is a parking garage for your convenience if you fancy driving into town.\n\nThe outside courtyard area is pretty amazing to sit in and take in the sun or people watch.  Definitely a tower worth noticing when in downtown.
