Calling this a tiki bar is a bit of a stretch but it's a good place to stop for a fruity drink if you are in the area.  We got a couple drinks while waiting for our table at Wahlburgers.  They have an \"all day happy hour\" with 2 for 1 drinks but you can't get them at the same time.  It's weird you have to come back to get the free drink.  Not sure the point of that, I guess so people don't share.  It is slightly annoying.  They have dole whip which is cool.  Bartenders were friendly but one of our drinks was made wrong.  I heard that a Born and Raised is going in to this spot.  Not sure how much longer they will be open if that is true.
