Four Peaks brews are well knows in Phoenix. I like the fact that they have a big restaurant where you can dine and enjoy all of their craft brews. I would say that as at as brewery food goes they are a 3 star for me. Very typical, nothing special. But I love the location, the beer, and the service is great. \n\nRecently I came here and tried the Green Chile Pork Poutine: Fries, Green Chile Pork, and White Cheddar Curds. Something you would for come up with and totally devour when you were drunk. Decent but nothing special as I said. I also had the BBQ Chicken Pizza: Chicken, Onion, Cilantro, and Mozzarella. The Pizza was pretty good. The crust was surprisingly very good. BBQ was sweet and tangy. Chicken was tender and there was more than enough to go around. I like this place for what it is and I will continue to come and enjoy craft beers and pub food.
