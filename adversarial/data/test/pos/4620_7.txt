This place is awesome!  I wouldn't have thought this was owned by the same company that owns the run down, horrible Copp's by where I live on Shopko Road on the east side. \n\nThe store is very visually appealing. Love that they have an ice cream station a sushi bar and other cool things like where they will cook whatever meat you buy. \n\nI'd gladly spend a little more to shop at Metro Market if they would put one in place of the nasty Copps on the east side.
