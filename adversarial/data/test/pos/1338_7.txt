The Cuppa is definitely a nice addition to Downtown Summerlin. There's tables and chairs inside as well out on the patio. Inside was clean and they have a bookshelf and some games that you can help yourself to during your stay. I ordered an Iced White Mocha with caramel drizzle, which was about $5, and it was pretty tasty. I'd order that drink again, but want to try some of the other drinks on their menu. For food they offer oatmeal, pastries and breakfast sandwiches all of which are reasonably priced. Staff is friendly and checked on my table a couple times to see if I needed anything. One huge plus is that the patio outside is dog friendly. The Cuppa is a great place to stop by and chill or grab a drink to enjoy while walking around DTS.
