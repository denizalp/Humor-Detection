Here's my recipe for a perfect Vegas trip: Three parts obscenely cheap to one part ludicrously expensive. The $10.99 champagne brunch at Paradise Buffet is the perfect flavor for the obscenely cheap part of that recipe. \n\nAre there even cheaper brunch buffets to be found in the City of Sin? I'm sure there are, but this is the perfect three star buffet for me. For the most part, it's what you'd expect from an $11 buffet - some of the stuff sucks, some of it is okay, the bacon was dishearteningly bad, but the prime rib was surprisingly delicious. They do tout themselves as a \"seafood\" buffet, but... that seafood wasn't looking too hot, so I stuck to the carving station.\n\nAnd, of course it wouldn't be called a champagne brunch without the champagne.... that they bring to you in these awesome plastic champagne glasses (not flutes, but the older saucer lookin' ones). And, boy do they keep it comin'.... and comin'... and comin'. It's not one of those places that proudly declares endless champagne and then a waitress is nowhere to be found. No sir. You'll be lucky if you EVER see the bottom of that little plastic champagne glass here.\n\nAll of this in the lush, dark, tropical setting of The Paradise Buffet. A-OK through and through.
