In an effort to attract millennials, Wicked Spoon has resorted to plating poor tasting food in highly nonfunctional small plates. With the dining plates only being able to hold 4 small plates at most, this forces even small eaters to get up and get food far more times than necessary. It seems as if in a generation where everything we eat must be Instagram worthy, Wicked Spoon has forgot that taste is far more important than plating. \n\nI will admit, the plating is nice, but compared to many cheaper buffets, the food is just too bland to actually justify the plating. \n\nCome here if you're already full and all you want is pretty food to post on Instagram. \n\nBellagio, Aria, Bacchanal are all far better and actually worth the money.
