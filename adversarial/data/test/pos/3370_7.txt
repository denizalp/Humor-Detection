In need of a fast food fix? Don't want to spend more than $10 buck on a burger? Then Checkers is for you! A friend wanted to go to Checkers and I have not been there before even though I have seen commercials on T. V. and driven by one many times before. My friend said their fries are amazing, so I was excited to try that. \n\nWe went through the drive thru and I ordered an American  cheese burger and funnel fries. Yes, as in funnel cake. Only it was in small stick shapes and sprinkled with powdered sugar. There was an option to have it fully loaded- strawberries and whip cream. I passed, but may try it next time. I thought the drive thru said the burger comes with lettuce,tomatoes and onions, but I may need wrong. My burger just came with cheese and I think ketchup and mustard. It had some flavor, wasn't dry, but was very average. The funnel fries were hot, slightly spongy, and sweet with powder sugar goodness. This could be dangerous. Luckily it comes in small, but I still mananged to get powdered sugar on my shirt. Lol. I tried some of my friend's Checkers fries and that was a game changer. It had a batter on it and was perfectly fried. Peppery, salty, and crispy. It reminds me of the outside of a good fried chicken only it was in the form of a French fry. This is definitely their winning item on their menu. \n\nThey have an outside seating area, but it didn't look very clean. There were big pigeons all over the place too. Maybe the birds are some sort of cleaning team picking up the scraps and leftovers because those birds were unusually big. Will not be eating out there, but I will come back in the drive thru for the fries alone though.
