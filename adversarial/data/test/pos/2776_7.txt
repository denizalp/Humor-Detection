I wanted to see Celine Dion sing Celine Dion songs, that didn't happen, she sang covers most of the time? Her voice is great, the orchestra was awesome, back-up singers were excellent, but whoever decided singing a duet with holograms should be fired. I wouldn't recommend this show unless they changed the cell phone ban and one could entertain oneself with a smartphone.
