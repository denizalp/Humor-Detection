They have variety going for it, and that's about it.  You expect average quality from buffets, but the quality at this place is just bad. The sushi isn't fresh, and I've actually seen them store premade rolls in a plastic bin.  There is nothing FRESH about that.  Their hot food isn't anything to write home about either. The only thing I can give them credit for is variety, but that won't do any good if nothing tastes good. Oh, the crepe station isn't bad actually. \n\nI've been obligated to go here several times due to various party invitations, but you definitely won't find me going here otherwise.
