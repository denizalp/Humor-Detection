Do you know what Vietnamese Pho is? If so -- please hold that orgasm until the end of this review. If not -- look that shit up like in the Encyclopædia Britannica at your local branch of the municipal public library or look in the Yellow Pages for the number for 411 then call 411 and get the switchboard operator to connect you to the Vietnamese Embassy in Ottawa and ask them or something. Or come here and try it for yourself and then have your own Phorgasm (that is a Pho-induced orgasm by the way and not a fancy way to say fake orgasm) preferably outside of the restaurant if you can wait. \n\nVegetarians (and non-vegetarians alike) of Montréal! Take notice! Petit Marché Végé is now going to be your favourite spot around town for all things Vietnamese and vegetarian. Get your vegetarian Pho on hard and kick your vegetarian Bánh mì game up a notch to a whole other level. Discover the wonderful world of vegetarian Vietnamese food!\n\nPho sho, yo, motherfuckin' Pho Pho sho. And it's not just Pho show either! Seriously, please, Mrs. Jackson, I am Pho reals. Phoget all your worries, Phoget all your cares and come down and zone out on some spicy noodle soup and maybe a Vietnamese submarine sandwich as well. Be Phorwarned! This soup is addictive and it'll have you begging Pho more. Hold the Phone ... did you say Pho? I'm gonna have to stop going to this place so frequently lest they decide to Bánh mì Pho life! That is my only Phobia. Okay, I'll stop now. Phoever. Phoeverever?\n\nAs Kermit the Frog says \"it's not easy being green.\" \n\nActually, it's pretty easy if green means being vegetarian. It's easy on the environment, it's easy on your body, it's easy on your pocketbook and it's probably easy on your karmic scoresheet, if you believe in that sort of stuff. Although when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine it can be pretty hard as there seems to be a dearth of selection ... especially in the Pho (awesome noodle soup) department. But then, hallelujah, I happened upon Petit Marché Végé and this has changed everything! \n\nThis place is part Vietnamese market and part Vietnamese delicatessen and one hundred percent vegetarian. Even vegan - upon request. This is revolution! Vietnamese vegetarian revolution! Hey hey, L.B.J. how many kids (or cows) have you killed today! Nixon wasn't any better either. Go out, burn your brassieres and burn your draft cards and remember that Vietnam won the war fair and square. Yes comrade, it's all the way back to Ho Chí Minh City for us with red stars on our shoulders and vegetarian food in our stomachs. As Brother Mohamed Ali once said \"I ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong ... no Viet Cong ever called me (expletive deleted)\". Are you feeling all \"Apocalypse Now\" and hearing that Buffalo Springfield song yet? \"For what it's worth\" ... By 1976 Communist North Vietnamese forces finally united North and South Vietnam and ended more than a century of combined European and American colonial and imperial hegemony and sent the Franks and the Yanks running with their tails between their legs. How do you say \"good riddance\" in Vietnamese? \n\nEnough politics! Now we eat. Step into a world of sensuous delights! Vegetarian and Vietnamese delights. If you're starving, order up a large bowl of beautiful hot and spicy Pho. Pho bcok (Đàng Ngoài) is the Northern Vietnamese style which is more subtle and nuanced than Pho Sài Gòn which is the Southern version that is spicier and a tad more flavourful but both are absolutely delectable! If you've got a penchant for chillies burning a hole through your tastebuds like I have you'll put aside the Sriracha briefly for the time being and ask specially for the special hot sauce. It is a delicious blast into outer space. If you've got sandwiches on your brain you probably should schedule an appointment with a neurologist. These Vietnamese Bánh mì submarine sandwiches are absolutely scrumptious. They have three versions for you to choose from. My favourite is the curried shiitake mushrooms. There is also an excellent bean curd sub as well as a barbecued tofu sub. Try them all as they are each very very special! Have some green bean pudding or grass jelly for dessert. \n\nEnjoy Vietnam!
