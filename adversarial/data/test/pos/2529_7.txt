The first time I stopped by thinking it was another Chick-fil-A place. The only similarity was the superior customer service. They do have a nice spacious dining area inside, patio, and TVs. \n\nI tried the Thai peanut chicken bowl and the Pimiento Crunch chicken sandwich. The chicken had a good crunch but tasted salty side to me. The Thai peanut bowl had a mixture of chicken tender strips, broccoli, mango salsa, peanuts, toasted coconut, rice, and thai peanut sauce. Nothing too special worth driving a distance for this bowl. Overall, Chick-fil-A still has my vote when I want my chicken tender and sandwich fixes.
