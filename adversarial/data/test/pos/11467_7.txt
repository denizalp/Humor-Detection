Nice gym, but I would like my membership price cut, as I'm sitting here at 1:13 pm on Sunday October 2nd watching 3 male staff watch the browns game.  Please fire them so you can cut my membership cost.  They're knuckleheads.  Also you need to hire a supervisor if you're going to have this much staff working on a Sunday.
