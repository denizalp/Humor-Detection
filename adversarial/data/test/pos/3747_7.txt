I feel like I start so many reviews by saying \"this if my fave spot in Pittsburgh\", but I swear on our 6 Super Bowl championships that Thai Cuisine is my absolute favorite place in this city! So much so that I have to limit myself to a weekly trip, cause if I had unlimited money, I'd eat here every day.\n\nTheir vegan\/veg options are plentiful, and the staff are super-knowledgeable about all the ingredients in their food and how items are prepared. You can rest-assured if you have any sort of dietary restriction or allergy, Thai Cuisine will happily accommodate you. They are also BYOB will a nominal fee. I recommend popping across the street to Caliente to pick-up beer if you forget to plan ahead!\n\nMy go-to dish is the Three Flavored Tofu with brown rice. Tofu is not an easy thing to cook, and there is nothing worse than mushy tofu. I can promise that the tofu from Thai Cuisine is fried to a crispy, golden perfection. Even your most carnivorous friends would find this dish delightful.\n\nNever change, Thai Cuisine.
