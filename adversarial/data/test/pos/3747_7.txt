In my opinion Coldstone is one of the best places to get a cold refreshing ice cream treat. A favorite of locals and visitors alike, they have a variety of ice cream and toppings, and sauces to make your own creation. This time I chose butter pecan ice cream mixed with caramel and pecans. It was so very good! They have the option to create tour own, or they have their signature creations as well. There are three sizes to choose from and also waffle cones, waffle bowls. This location is clean, and the service is friendly.
