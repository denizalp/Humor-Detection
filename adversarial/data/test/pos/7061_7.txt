This cigar bar I have history with; it was a frequent on my late husbands and I date night. It has been 3 1\/2 months without him so today I am celebrating things that we did together. The staff here is always amazing and has such good customer service. They use humor to stay up beat with one another. I love to see a crew that works and plays together. They create a genuine feeling here that makes one feel like your among friends smoking cigars and drinking beer. What could be better ? How about with my check in I got a free beer or glass of champagne? I opted for the beer today, IPA flavor. The beer was so smooth. So cheers to you dear, me, the future, and great cigars and beer!!!!
