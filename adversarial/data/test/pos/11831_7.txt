I love coming to this location.  The yearly mammogram trip is no fun but there is no way around it. The front desk people are very professional and fast.  I was called to the back and headed to get my test.  After the technician was done, she asked me if I wanted to wait for the results.  I already knew about this service, that is why I chose this location.  Yes,  if you wait 30 minutes in the waiting area they will come back with your results.  If you have to have your tatas squeezed, might as well get the answer fast.
