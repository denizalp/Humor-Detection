I left this clinic , because I was very disappointed of everything . Over all I have another doctor now. It this new clinic they did new X-rays and calculated my insurance coverage , it was much cheaper . Crown was $150 less the at four seasons dental place. They just tried to get as much money as they can. Also my new doctor was amazed how bad was a cleaning work!!! This four seasons dental place is such a mess!!
