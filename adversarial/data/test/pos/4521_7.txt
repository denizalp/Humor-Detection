Came to see Les Miserables.  This cast and crew are definitely off, off, off, keep going, off Broadway. It's one step up from a community college troop.  Technical difficulties from start to finish.  Ushers seating late guests any time they pleased and the 2nd Act after the intermission started  without any kind of warning.  Half the audience was trying to find their seats in the dark.\n\nAcoustics are terrible even with wireless mics.  Couldn't hear half of the vocals throughout. Also, the lax attitude tends to draw the . . . less cultured, trashy audience.  I've come to expect jeans and t-shirts at Theatre\/Opera, but this was the first time I witnessed snowman yoga pants at a show.  Keep it classy, ladies.   Popcorn in the theater was the icing on the trailer park cake.  Was expecting a hot dog guy or funnel cakes to be coming by at any minute.\n\nNever coming to this shack again.
