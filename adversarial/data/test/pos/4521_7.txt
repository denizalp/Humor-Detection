Went here because I wanted authentic greasy stick to your ribs Mexican food. Unfortunately all I got was the greasy part. \n\nI ordered a combo enchilada and taco platter. The shredded beef was dry and the whole plate was just too salty. It came with an ample helping of beans and rice, which were tasty but nothing special.\n\nHowever I do have to agree that this place has great chips and salsa. And the wait staff is very generous with them. \n\nI just wish the rest of the meal had lived up to the chips.
