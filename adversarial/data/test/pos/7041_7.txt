Sorry Starbucks.  I think I found my new drink of choice.  And you don't make it.\n\nThe first time I came here, I got a hot chocolate to go to fortify me for a trip to REI.  The hot chocolate wasn't my favorite - not sweet enough or chocolately enough.  But the staff was great and it was the prettiest hot chocolate I ever had.  \n\nThe second time was for the Yelp book club, where the very nice man behind the counter gave me a tasty peppermint tea, for free!  I love that the tea comes in a french press and you get to serve it yourself.  Very nice touch.\n\nFinally, today, I came here for breakfast and got a decaf flat white.  Best drink ever if you like lattes.  I appreciate that they can make it decaf and with the care they put into making the drinks, I can actually feel comfortable that it is indeed decaf.  I'm never quite sure with Starbucks.  I also got a blueberry scone, which was very tasty and actually a normal portion size!  \n\nI'm definitely going to become a regular flat white drinker and a regular at Sambalatte.
