I ALWAYS regret coming to this Starbucks location. I've currently been standing here waiting for my simple iced coffee for 5 minutes and they're not even busy. I only stop here occasionally because it happens to be on my way to run errands. \n\nThe cream\/sugar stand is always unkept and the workers are super rude. \n\nGo to the one on Jones (Badura). For real.\n\nOkay if you must go here go through drive-thru because it seems to be faster.
