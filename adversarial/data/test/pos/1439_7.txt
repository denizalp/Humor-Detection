They gave me little yellow picked peppers in a packet with my order.\n\nMindblown.\n\nGrowing up in California and going to the original In-N-Out branch- you'd think I would know everything the \"secrets\". \n\nApparently not as this is my first pepper packet after 17 years. \n\nThis place was crazy packed when we went, but I had some friends from Seattle in town that really wanted to have some and this is the closest one to take them. I wish we took them to the Sahara branch because it was a bit of a clusterfuck. I'm sure for first timers though, seeing the famous burger with so many people gathering is a impressive thing. I got one a few blocks from home and had so many of these that the group excitement doesn't hit me. \n\nMajor kudos to the crew here as they churn out so many orders that these folks must be always tired after a shift.
