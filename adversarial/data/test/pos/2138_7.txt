Was just chillin on a Friday past midnight at a coffee shop then got a text from my friend Lisa bored as hell wanting to go out.  I've already made up my mind not to go out tonight turning down several friends but damn it, she's a lil cutie so I said yes.\n\nCalled her up and we decided to go to the Griffin (my fav spot in downtown). Went home to change...skinny jeans, check......flannel top, check......old ass beat up chucks I've had since high school, check.....yup this is the way I dress and reason why I love downtown Vegas because the crowd and people there express themselves more freely and not caught up with gold diggin' skanks, ed hardy wearin' muscle heads that you occasionally bump into at nightclubs in the strip.  The strip is just too glamorous for me.\n\nDrinks are cheap and the back room is bumpin with songs with the likes of Queens, old school hip hop, 80's, and other hits that I like but never usually hear at most bars.  Everyone comes here to socialize and dance without a care.  Most people here can't dance including me but we just don't give a damn, stepping on each other's shoes and just having fun.  That's why I love this place, the diversity, the type of style I like to see, friendly social atmosphere, and the cool samoan bouncers that make me feel like I'm back home in Torrance, CA.\n\nOn a quiet day, this is a nice place to bring someone to have a conversation.  Inside is dark, plenty of seating, with fireplaces that just sets up a mood of comfort and chill time to escape from the day.
