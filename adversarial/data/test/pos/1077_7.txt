I love donuts. Like donuts could be my best friend. There is just something so delicious and tantalizing about a perfect donut. These donuts are out of bounds. So out of bounds that I am mad at myself that I don't go more often but having donuts as a best friend is also bad for your health - so all things in moderation. But if I could, I would eat these donuts every day. EVERY DAY.\n\nThe hunt for local donuts in the Charlotte & Surrounding areas is fairly small prior to my previous living areas but with places like the Bakery Shoppe, it definitely makes up for it.\n\nThe donuts actually taste like donuts. The dough is excellent, the toppings not too sweet. It is a balance of perfection. They were not dry, they were fresh and actually held up for a few days too. The donuts sell out pretty fast! I learned that on our visit when we wanted something else but the people in front got the last. So learn from me, if you come for donuts on the weekend come early!\n\nI can't wait to come back and try a cake because I will definitely utilize their services for cakes. If the donuts are amazing then the cakes have to just be as good.
