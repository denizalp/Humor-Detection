I was interested in this place after seeing a bunch of yelp buds check into here. It was a very solid experience. \n\nI guess that this used to be the old Firefly restaurant, with the same owners as Firefly. Instead of a tapas restaurant, they have turned it into an upscale Mexican restaurant.\n\nThe interior is dark and moody, giving the place a very relaxed feel where you can just kick back and chill with your buddies.\n\nFirst ordered the house guacamole. It was nicely made, but I thought it could have used a touch more seasoning. But, I did enjoy that lil kick of heat that they put in it. The chips were super crispy, and not too greasy.\n\nThen, my tacos came out. First, I gotta say, I love the tacos here. They put a lot of attention to the small details. The rock shrimp tacos are bomb. Coated with a slightly spicy (but not too spicy) seasoning, they were cooked to perfection. I would also recommend the crunchy tacos. They actually put mashed potatoes in them! And it works marvelously. The lengua and barbacoa tacos were hits as well.\n\nOrdered some sides as well. The charro beans were just OK. I did like the fresh chicharrones on top though. Also got the hot chilies. I would say to avoid this. It came with just 3 roasted chilies that were cooked with lime juice. I'm sure there are better options on the sides menu that you can choose.\n\nI like this place and would come back here with friends and colleagues. I would also like to try some drinks here next time, they seem to have an interesting program going on there.
