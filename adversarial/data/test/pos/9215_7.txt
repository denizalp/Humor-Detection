Ok. 4 stars for a solid meal. The menu has a little bit of everything, it's a nice setting, the service is top-notch, the beer selection is decent, the desserts are slammin', and that cornbread app is freaking awesome. I enjoyed the grouper and several New Belgium Rangers, but I don't want to spend my time on the food. It's great, so know that. You'll be happy with most everything under this roof. However, I want to spend my time on HOW DARK IT IS INSIDE. I needed my friends to wear bells so we could locate where their table was.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not mad at all. I rather enjoyed the setting. I found it so comically dark, though, at our table that I actually used my phone as an added light source for my friend to read the menu, the bill, and even the cards in my wallet. My eyes didn't want to adjust hardly at all throughout the meal. I think all of us commented on how low the lighting was. It was so cozy that I wanted to ask for a few more napkins, kick back at a booth, and take a nap. It really closes you in, too. You feel like you're in your own dining room with nothing but candle light. A nice touch, but you have to be ready for it. With some of the bar staff opening the door to the setting sun, you may feel like a hibernating mammal being rudely awakened. Sunlight, kindly stay out of the dining room. \n\nImmensely enjoyed my first visit with 131 and only wish that I had done so sooner.
