I first took my car in for a belt replacement.  Later on I got it and it seemed fine but the next day it started to fray and was basically going to break off.  I took it in again and they claimed it was put on the wrong way.  They said it was covered under warranty and would put it on right and have it ready by end of day.  Ok no problem, but when they phoned me they said there was another problem: the power steering rack decided to explode as they were taking it out the garage door.  I was somewhat suspicious of this as they couldn't even put a belt on right in the first place. I brought up this possibility of them maybe doing something wrong to cause this breakdown with the manager.  He of course got defensive & rude and said this was definitely not their fault.  Afterwards he said he would replace the power steering rack half price and I wouldn't have to pay for labor due to all the trouble & being near Christmas.  I found this really strange he said this since he first claimed none of this was the mechanics fault.  I of course took the offer cause I was in a rock and a hard place & basically had no choice! \n  This was done  December of last year.  Just found out my power steering rack went again! I phoned Oakridge and asked about a warranty on this rack which should have been for a year.  We compared BOLs over the phone and he claimed there was no indication they had ever done a rack replacement on their BOL!! Therefore there was nothing they were going to do about it. Since I'm in Edmonton now I decided just to forget playing these games with these guys and just go over to a certified auto garage and get it done right.  Now I have to pay $1200 for a job that should have been covered under warranty.  Will I go to Oakridge Automotive ever gain? Never!  Buyer beware and make sure you go to a trusted mechanic!
