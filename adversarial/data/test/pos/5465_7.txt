Soooo good!\n\nAlthough the sign outside says \"POO\" and thus always make me laugh, the food is awesome and the menu is rather eclectic and unconventional. I have had two superb dishes here. Although they sound very similar (honey almond chicken and honey walnut chicken), they were prepared differently and tasted GREAT! Fattening and rich ... But great.\n\nWonton soup was ah-mah-zing. While the wontons weren't the best (a little flimsy), the broth was perfect!!\n\nAlso, I love that they have Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese dishes here. Very unique and flavorful food. I've only gotten takeout; would love to dine in sometime.
