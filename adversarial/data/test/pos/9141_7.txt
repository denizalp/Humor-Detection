Literally the worst place I've ever been to in my entire life. Was discriminated against for being white and told \"it's because you're white, it's not your style\". I was treated poorly from the minute I walked in the door (after I waited 30 min in line). The bouncer let 2 Latina women enter the club for free but charged me $10 at the door. I asked him why and he said they had already been in there yet they were waiting in line behind me for 30 minutes so that's a definite lie. The drinks were $10 each FOR WELL DRINKS PEOPLE. This is Phoenix not Miami?!?!!!!!! I will never ever return to this \"club\". Bunch of racist discriminating cheeseburger eating rude ass holes.
