I had the chance to go here this past Saturday afternoon looking to grab a milkshake.  Don't ask me why I wanted a milkshake on a Saturday afternoon in the middle of January, I just did, and Mattie's seemed like the perfect place to grab one.  \n\nAfter walking in and taking a seat at the counter with my girlfriend, a waitress took our order - strawberry milkshake with whipped cream.  All I can tell you folks, is that this is the best milkshake I've had in a long, long time.  It was the perfect consistency, not runny, but not so thick so that it couldn't be enjoyed via a straw. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, it took much longer than I would've expected to prepare a simple strawberry milkshake.  But it wasn't until I saw the waitress putting strawberries into the blender that I realized what the hold-up was.  YES, they actually make their milkshakes with REAL STRAWBERRIES folks!\n\nI've been to Mattie's a few other times after concerts at the Fillmore.  As I remember, their burgers where pretty good, although my stomach definitely wasn't too good the next morning.  Either way, this review isn't about the new Music Factory, the vast amounts of free parking or even the friendly service.  This review is all about the milkshake baby and it starts and stops at delicious!!
