Is it Five Star day or am I just in a good mood?\n\nPF Changs...PeiWei...Teneko's...Flemings?\n\nHow does Fleming's fit in with the whole asian themed restaurant empire thingy that Peter Fleming put together?\n\nI don't know...more importantly, I don't care...Fleming's Steakhouse is the best of the lot by my lights:)\n\nDoes Fleming's make the best steak in town? \n\nWell no, the best steak in town comes off my grill, when I'm in the mood to grill:)\n\nBut I'm not always in the mood to grill my own steak and when I'm not, Flemings consistently puts a very solid medium rare Rib Eye ( with a little salad and a few string fries) right in front of me (along with a couple of well made Grey Goose marti's:)\n\nThey do it in a friendly style with  exemplary and easy going service in a warm and welcoming atmosphere...lighter d√©cor than some of the very low lit\/dark wood\/red velvet steakhouses (BTW...not enough light to read the menu doesn't make the steak taste any better:)\n\nFlemings has never done me wrong...\n\nI have never felt \"optimized\" like I do at Ruth's Chris...I haven't felt that I overpaid for mediocre food like I do at Morton's or Mastro's...I never feel that I'm out of place when I show up wearing my shorts, sandals and golf shirt (exquisitely tailored, highly expensive shorts, sandals and golf shirt, but nevertheless:)\n\nFlemings is a comfortable and pleasant place to grab a steak:)\n\nThe Beautiful Carin and I wandered over the other evening, intending to take advantage of the current Happy Hour specials (5 items for $6...5 wines, 5 cocktails and five small plates, each priced at $6...all of which are phenomenal, BTW:)\n\nBut after a couple of well crafted and astonishingly cold marti's, we decided we wanted dinner:)\n\nI had the bone in Rib Eye and Carin had the New York Strip (my girl likes her steak:)\n\nWe split some shoestring potatoes and grilled asparagus:)\n\nEverything was essentially perfect...a little too much food, but we took it home and DeeDee continues to believe that we are The Best People Ever:)\n\nThe next time you're in the mood for steak and you don't feel like heading out to your grill on a balmy 112 degree Scottsdale evening, put on your shorts and golf shirt, slide into your sandals, get comfy in a booth at Flemings and build yourself a $200 credit card bill.\n\nHey, I never said they were cheap...just good!
