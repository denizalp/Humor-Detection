Very good service this morning for the state inspection on my wife's car. I was able to book an appointment online and when I arrived, I was seen at the time of my appointment. The service manager who helped me was very polite and helpful. I think they did a good job, especially considering that there is very little profit for them for one of these.\n\nThe waiting room was okay with chairs, coffee and a television. Free wifi worked well, but a table where I could put my laptop would have been a nice bonus.
