My review starts and stops with the telephone conversation I had.  I called to make an appointment and the man on the phone was very short and rude.  He sounded rushed and didn't even seem to care what's I was calling in to have done.  \n\nHe told me a week and a half wait for an appointment (still not knowing for what).  Then he hung up without saying goodbye.  \n\nI'm glad I took my business elsewhere
