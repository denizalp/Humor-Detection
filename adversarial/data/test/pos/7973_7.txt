With my husband and son out of town, my daughter and I met a friend on Saturday for a girls' lunch... We decided to meet at this First Watch due to it's convenient location + the fact that at least one of us may be in gym clothes (ahem, that was me), and didn't want to deal with too much of a busy scene or a place that was all about seeing and being seen.\n\nUpon entering, it was clear that there wouldn't be a much of a scene, as there were plenty of open tables.  That part was a relief, but we were a bit concerned to find several parties waiting and barely being acknowledged when half the restaurant was empty.  When we were finally acknowledged, the host \/ hostess were not the friendliest, approximating a 15-20 minute wait and forgetting to mention that we could have chosen to sit immediately at their \"community table.\"  We learned about that a few minutes later when another party walked in and sat right down.\n\nLuckily, we didn't have to wait that long and we were seated at a comfy booth about 5-10 minutes later.  Service wasn't the best, as we had to wait awhile for our water \/ coffee \/ juice, but once we ordered, it all turned out fine.  \n\nOne thing to know if you go here... Avocado Toast.  That is definitely the way to go.  It may be on a temporary summer menu, but my advice to FW is to keep that puppy on the menu forever.  If I come back, that is what I'll come back for!  I was also pleasantly surprised with the kids menu... my daughter had the eggs and bacon which comes with toast, fruit and a drink.  \n\nThis location doesn't feel a ton like a chain, which I like.  The inside has a warm vibe, fun decor, clean bathrooms, etc... they also have a shaded patio, which a couple of brave patrons were sitting at despite the high temps in the 100s this weekend.  If they can get a strong manager in place and\/or improve the service a bit, I'd consider adding this to my regular breakfast rotation for sure... especially if that avocado toast sticks around on the menu!
