While the sales pitch and proposal process was fine, it was everything that occurred after the initial appointment, that was terrible.  I had to call no less than three times to get my service scheduled, each time with a promise they would get back to me and nothing.  The sales representative said we would be scheduled within a week on February 22nd and that turned into three weeks and when I finally called the last time to cancel the project altogether, it was, oh, we have a cancellation, we can come the day after tomorrow.  How long would it have been if there was no cancellation?  Next were the installers that were absolutely horrible, and one, if not both, should be terminated based on their attitude and extremely poor work ethic.  They neglected to accomplish anything close to what the sales person told me they would, even stating that sales people always promise the world.  I vividly recall the sales rep stating that RetroFoam would put everything back as it was found, that is all I really wanted.  Not only did my 68-year old mother-in-law have to continuously remind them to move the furniture back in place, she had to take photos of the television and A\/V components so your installers could put it back together again.  Even then, one installer argued with her about what they are accountable for doing.  She spent over an hour cleaning up and replacing things where they were supposed to be, and that was just on inside of the house, not just the slight product run-off you spoke of.  When I arrived home that evening, I had to call again as they completely dismantled two sheds and left the pieces of the sheds and all the shed contents laying all over my backyard.  They left the touch up paint out and open, paint brushes laying around, spilled paint, food and beverage containers from their lunch, and all of which where my dog could get at it.  Not to mention, again, all of the shed contents everywhere and a ridiculous amount of foam in my pool.  How does that happen?  It was so ridiculous that I thought your guys were coming back the next day because they were unable to finish, it was in that much of a disarray.  While you sent the installers back out the next day, after yet another phone call to you, they corrected MAYBE 50% of what they left laying around and successfully damaged one of the sheds enough to where it doesn't close anymore, a $349 unit.  Additionally, as a result of the install, our home phone service stopped working.  It seems your product got into the phone jacks causing replacement jacks to be required.  This took my time to contact Cox Communications and to be home for them to come and trouble shoot and replace the issues, a $150 fee for this matter.  Let alone the issue of not having home phone service for a week.  Sure, I could have called you about this, but I didn't want anyone from your company back on my property after these experiences.  We will be discouraging anyone from this company and their services.
