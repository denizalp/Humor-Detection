I paid $22 for my room, and then $20 to an upgrade.  The lady at check-in then waived my fee for the upgrade, and I got a really nice room.  It is like a Motel 6 with pretensions to be a Radisson, but the key point was its pleasant cleanliness and newness.\n\nThis place is historic, for sure.  Marlene Deitrich performed here, along with Louis Armstrong.  This hotel was obviously the epicenter of Dean Martin whiskey swilling boozy smoke-filled room days and the classiness that somehow went along with all that.\n\nI am being kind to the hotel to give them 4 stars.  The casino was tired, smoky (no longer cool), the music too loud, and omnipresent, and the clientelle not the best on the economic scale.  I did not enjoy listening to country music as I played roulette.  DID NOT.\n\nThe casino is a dictionary definiton of vulgarity, but even better (or worse) was outside the building where I tried to take refuge around noon:  brochures advertising hookers blowing across the ground, dirty, torn, and faded, with photos that looked like the covers of 1980's porn VHS tapes.  Some things never change, right?\n\nIs possible to be base without being offensive?  I would have rather seen this hotel go the opposite direction, towards order:  moral, financial, architectural, all kinds.  Alas, it was not in the cards.\n\nThe hotel is definitely ok.  The casino was so awful that it was interesting.  They put a Buddha statue in the center of the casino, and that is the most interesting thing I saw in Las Vegas.\n\nLas Vegas-  don't go.  But if you are curious, then enjoy.
