In the city Extreme Fitness is one of the Better Places to Workout....But they are far from Being Perfect!\n\nHere is my 5 Star Rating for some general Categories:\n\nGroup Classes **** \nGreat beginner-advanced yoga classes, but the yoga room is starting to smell like \"Feet\" so bring your own Mat.  Do try the Wed. Boxing Class, and All the Spin Classes Rock.\n\nEquipment ****\nComplete selection of Machines,  Free Weights and Cardio equipment.  Could use more medicine balls, Kettle Balls.  Most of the TV's work.\n\nCleanliness ***\nProceed with caution.  Even if you can't see it, how clean can a Changeroom\/Shower be, that services hundreds of people a day?\n\nTrainers?\nI have No need for a personal trainer so can't comment...But I suspect Trainers are like Mechanics, they tell you more work is needed than actually is! \n\nCustomer Service *\nCould use some work.  Impersonal and most of the time Self-absorbed people at the front desk.  Trying to get a towel or your card back can sometimes be a hassle.  I can't wait until these people can be replaced by Hot Robots.\n\nOverall I give it 3 Stars.  Its as good as a Group Membership gym can be.
