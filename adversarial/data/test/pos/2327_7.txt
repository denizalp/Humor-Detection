BBD...Bell Biv Devoe or Black Bear Diner?? Either way, you'll want to smack it up, flip it, rub it down!!   We came in with appetites and left with food babies.  \n\nI felt bad for our poor waitress because I literally sent her away 3 times before I was ready to order.   Impressive, extensive menu that has every savory, buttery delicious breakfast treat and combo you could ever hope for.\n\nMy girlfriend commented that the crowd was a bizarre mix of local seniors and mature families...and young yelpers.  She was right.  But what everyone had in common were forkfuls of pancake goodness and huge contented smiles.  Oh mama.....are they pancakes or cupcakes??  wow.\n\n I always give bonus points to Vegas establishments that don't feel like Vegas.  This place, as others have said, has a comfortable Northwestern atmosphere, that the owners have succeeded in keeping authentic (if a bit kitschy) with several hundred bears everywhere your eye wanders. Papa Bear swung by our table to check on us, which was a nice touch.\n\nHighly recommended.
