City of Las Vegas - you get to be my Yelp Review #900!\n\nMany many years ago, I remember driving to Las Vegas from San Francisco via Southern California.  As we entered this city of lights and desert heat, all I could ever remember thinking was, \"I could never live in Las Vegas...it's so far from the ocean!\"\n\nFast forward to 2006 and I started to become a regular visitor to this city that was once so foreign to me.  Before I knew it, I'm living here and starting a completely new life here with the boyfriend (the BF).  It's here in this city that the boyfriend became the Big F (the fiance), and eventually, the Husband.  \n\nLas Vegas started to grow on me as I discovered more activities and events that kept us busy beyond the Strip life.  (And it doesn't hurt that we have our fave restaurants here - Ichiza, Hot N Juicy Crawfish, Shabu Shabu Paradise, Luv-It Custard, Poke Express, Lawry's, etc.)  \n\nYelp came along last year with an official community manager, which meant even more fun times and more great people to meet!  Las Vegas was getting better and better in my eyes!\n\nBut it's 2011 that the City of Las Vegas has brought on a new role for me in my life, and that is the role of \"mother\".\n\nOn January 16th, I gave birth to my adorable son (the Baby) and on his birth certificate it says he was born in the City of Las Vegas, Clark County.  \n\nThis city has now brought on a new permanence in my life.  Not only has it become my home, but the home of my family. \n\nAnd so, I can't help but love the City of Las Vegas.  It's brought on a whole new meaning in my life.
