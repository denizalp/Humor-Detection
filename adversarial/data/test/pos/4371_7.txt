We came across this place while chillin' at the 595.  We had the munchies and dined in really quick. \n\nNow we are hooked.  We've been here several times and this week we were having a party at our house and came here to get a bunch of food to go.  \n\nEveryone was very happy with the meat, chicken and veggies.  If you like Greek food then this is a must try. \n\nGood prices, good service and good food.
