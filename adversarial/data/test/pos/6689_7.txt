Man! I remember going to Hops when I was a kid! Sad that not too many are open these days, but I suppose I can see why. It's a bit of a 90's-esque trend in restaurants that didn't have long to live. \n\nThe menu is pretty blah -- steaks, burgers, boring salads. HOWEVER, I do remember that their bleu cheese dressing was some of the best I'd ever had. I was just a kid then and didn't experience the same here. Boo. \n\nBest thing in your life: Honey Croissants served pre-meal. Screw that. More like served THROUGHOUT. I'd make an entire meal out of these things. They are just pure magic. Whatever sorcery they use to make these is fine by me. \n\nThe beer? Ehhhhh it's not for me. Weak and doesn't showcase a ton of variety for my palate. Will I drink it? Sure. Will I do cartwheels over it? Nope. \n\nHops, you're ok by me. I'll more than likely be by in the next 25 minutes for some of those croissants. \n\nCheers.
