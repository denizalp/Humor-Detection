Man I love Kinh Do. I wonder how many stars I have given it. WHAT!?!I I have been going here and check-in for about 2 years now but I have never written a review.. *sad face*. \n\nThis is my go to first stop every time I hit up Las Vegas! I'm going to call this town LAS VEGAS and not Vegas. I'm sure the locals can appreciate that :). It's a lot like calling San Francisco by  \"Frisco\" nobody in San Francisco calls it that. Only people that are FOBs or from NYC call it Frisco. Get it right. Frisco is a town in Texas and besides it just sounds dirty (not texas- the name). I'm gonna Frisco you. That will be my new song starting R Kelly and Jodeci.\n\nANYWAYS! Las Vegas is like my second home. So many good and bad memories. She is like the one that got away and the crazy ex. So, here is my advise to you. EAT PHO! The Pho in California is way better, but that shouldn't stop you from visiting here when you are in town. The crazy casinos and vendors trying to suck your wallet dry is just too much! You need to ground yourself for a peaceful and affordable meal in Chinatown before you start your personal version of HANGOVER 3. \n\nI have watched as this restaurant went from a small whatever restaurant to becoming the clean and great customer service restaurant it is today. Before it had bad service and was dirty. I didn't know what door to enter from. I didn't know who was working and who were customers. The store was either blasting Vietnamese fashion rock videos? Or some other high techno trance music. Those days are over for the better. Now the restaurant is grown up, matured, and went to college got a degree and now wears a suit and tie doesn't charge the ivy school pricing. \n\nPROS:\n-Pho soup is hardy.\n-One size only, but it's large.\n-Menu has a lot of variety from Banh Mi to Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef blood soup). I want to try both of those, but I end up ordering pho every time.\n-Service is great and attentive.\n-Ice coffee good :)\n-Spring Rolls are packed with Shrimp\n-Clean\n\nCONS:\n-Directions. The location is hidden near a few massage places and a gun range. The best advise so you don't pass this location. When heading west on Mountain Spring Road look for the Kinh Do sign on the right side. Turn right away before you get to the Arco gas station (opposite side from Wells Fargo). I still miss the turn every time.\n-MSG :(. Man I'm thirsty.\n\nFor my peeps driving from So Cal, this place will not impress you pho wise, but the Las Vegas strip is freaking expensive so eat something good that won't break the bank. I recommend this place for locals, because it's still a great place to go, no annoying tourist here. On my recent visit to Las Vegas, I went here for lunch on day one and for lunch on my final day. It's worth a try.
