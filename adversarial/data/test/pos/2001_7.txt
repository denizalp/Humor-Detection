Oh my god. This Starbucks has so many wrongs. When I place a mobile order I expect to have it ready in the amount of time it says it will be. I even take a little longer so that it's ready when I get there. But no, not ready. Still have to wait a long time for them to make my stuff on top of the long wait they already make you wait in person... I was late to school thank you very much Starbucks. \n\nAnd theeeen today they left me hanging at the drive thru. He took my order, I asked if they had morning buns, and he disappears for a good five minute. I kept saying hello, and another girl starts talking. Ummmm hi where did the guy who took my order go? She's confused I'm confused, I told her the situation and she tells me they have no more morning buns. Okay cool, I didn't think it would take that long and much confusion for an answer.\n\nI pull up to the window and it still takes forever and a day to get my drinks and butter croissant. I'm now late to school again.\n\nStarbucks is supposed to make people happy not angry.
