Came here during Restaurant Week for birthday dinner #2.  Alton's is tucked away in the corner of a shopping strip in front of Harris Teeter. We kind of had a hard time finding it and then figuring out which side was the front door. \nThe restaurant was really nice and seemed to have a lot of spaces for private events.\nThey take reservations but you have to call the restaurant to make them. We were immediately seated once arriving and our waitress immediately came to our table once we were seated to get our drink orders. \nI ordered from the RW menu and ordered the Lobster Bisque, the Surf and Turf and the Apple Crisp for dessert.\nThe Lobster Bisque was hearty and full of flavor. I liked the small amount of whipped potatoes in the middle of the Bisque. The Surf and Turf was great, the lobster was seasoned and baked well done. The steak came on a kabob but was big pieces of beef. The asparagus were huge but sautéed just enough were they were not too soft but also not too crunchy. My favorite entrée of the meal was the apple crisp, I ate it before I could take a picture of it. The brown sugar, pecan crumble was amazing and the ice cream complemented the crisp really well.
