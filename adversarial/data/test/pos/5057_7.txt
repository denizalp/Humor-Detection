My wife and I were trying to decide between a Circe show and this one.  I wanted to see some comedy and I convinced my wife to go. There were some laughs but nothing like it was being billed. \n\nThe acrobatics were fantastic, I'm always amazed at what they can do with their bodies, 5 stars.\n\nThe venue was the perfect size but when it was all said and done we were disappointed in the show and how much we had paid for it.  This should have been a 50$ show not 100$. \n\nThis is a \"see once\" show only and I wish I hadn't seen it even once.
