(10 course tasting menu) Food: 3.5 stars, Ambiance: 5 stars, Service: 5 stars.\n\nI had mixed feelings about how to rate George because I so desperately wanted to love this place after seeing such raving reviews and from previous positive tasting menu experiences from other restaurants. I was expecting a terrific dinner experience which was exactly how it started off to be. \n\nI came here for an anniversary dinner and I'd have to say the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and has such a chic romantic aura. They were extremely accommodating when I had to change the reservation time and change the seating from patio to inside the restaurant. We got seated in a lovely booth at the back of the restaurant which was so cosy.\n\nFood: You have the choice of trying the tasting menus (5, 7, 10 courses) or a la cart. But of course you have to go for the tasting so we opted for the full 10 course ($150pp). We were warned that it would take approximately 4 hours but we weren't deterred because we wanted the full fledged experience and it actually only turned out to be around 3 hours in total (bonus!). Each course between the 2 of us was different so we basically got to try 20 different dishes which sounded pretty awesome right?\n\nThe problem and why 3.5 stars for food? Two reasons: \n1) I did not feel the 'omg this is SO FREAKEN GOOD' exclamation mark that I expect to feel for a tasting menu at this price point. I'd have to say that each dish was so intricately prepared and beautifully presented but to talk purely on taste it lack a certain 'wow' factor. Don't get me wrong - there were certainly dishes that we loved  and thoroughly enjoyed (such as the foie gras, crab cake, and lamb) but that brings me to my second point.. \n\n2) I felt like they could incorporate more hot food in their courses and a larger portion for their main course. Very few courses had the steamy, just off the stove heat to it and of the few, they were somewhat lukewarm. Not a single soup or pasta or risotto (only asking for a small portion of hearty carbs here) in 20 different varieties? A bit surprised. I think they can definitely think about improving on increasing variety on the menu rather than just a variation of vegetables and meats for all the courses. Also, they had a really tasty main course of lamb and steak but they can increase the portions a bit. I would not consider myself as someone that could eat a lot but I was not completely full until after dessert and I expect to get the satisfied and full feeling BEFORE we get to dessert. \n\nAll in all, still 4 stars for George because they really had impeccable service and a gorgeous restaurant. I would recommend this place for special occasions as it was a really pleasurable experience but from the food perspective, I personally found some areas for improvement.
