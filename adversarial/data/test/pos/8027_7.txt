So I haven't been to Red Lobster since... since I used to dive into that little toy treasure chest and fish myself out a plastic knick-knack to keep my entertained on the ride home to play my NES. But its safe to say when I think of Red Lobster, I don't really take it too seriously as a quality restaurant. When I was younger I used to think of it as high end seafood, but as an older gent I think of it as more low end seafood. Like a Long John Silvers inside a Swiss Chalet shell.\n\nWhy would I go to Red Lobster if I don't hold it in high regard? Well the mrs. got a gift card from her parents and we figured \"what the hell\". There was one where we were going that day anyway.\n\nThe staff was nice, the food is gross. It lived up to a rep I had not experienced first had.\n\nThe biscuits they bring to the table are ok at first, but you realize just how salty they are. \n\nThe Caesar salad was passable, but forgettable.\n\nThem the main course, king crab legs and garlic butter shrimp. The shrimp were slimy. Essentially served in a dish of butter and water, not just butter. The crab, boiled to shit! I always thought it was hard to screw up crab, but they did. When you snapped a crab leg, the meat snapped too. There was no firmness to it, which mean ripping the whole shell apart to get to the meat (which was flaky and stuck to the sides of the shelf). \n\nOn top of this, all this food was super salty too. \n\nBottom line, Red Lobster made me want to barf, as did the fact I had to pay $37 on top of the $25 gift card for what is one of the worst meals I've had.\n\nNow I understand there might be die hard Red Lobster fans out there who hate what I'm saying but trust me, if you want great seafood skip RL and head to Rodney's oyster house downtown. The lobster is the same price, and done right.\n\nGod that meal was gross. Bleh.
