If you are drunk and you're in Vegas, heck, even if you're not drunk and in Vegas, this IS the place to be. \n\nJust try any sandwich and it will taste like heaven because 1) it's probably the cheapest thing you can get in vegas even cheaper than cheap hookers lol just kidding 2) the best drunk hot sandwich you will ever taste and 3) the best next-day hangover sandwich because you didn't finish it the night before \n\nI recommend the club or the chipotle sandwiches. \n\nThe only downside is that the lines are ridiculous. But you will be with friends so the time in line will go by pretty fast.
