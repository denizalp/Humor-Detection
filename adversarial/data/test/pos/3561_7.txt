I so prefer Open Pitt over Kim's Wings. I stopped by here last weekend and left out because it was crowded and no one was at the window taking orders. I instead called in my order and came back. The sauce is okay, but my big issue when ordering wings is when feathers are left on the wings, which is exactly what I got here. What a disappointment to know they don't take the time to clean their wings, makes me wonder what else they don't take the time to clean.
