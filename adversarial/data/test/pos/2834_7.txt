If I lived next door at the Catalyst, I would be in some serious trouble. Why? Well, I would probably come over here every day and get something covered in shrimp sauce. Shrimp sauce makes everything better.\n\nMy good friends Andrea and Jason have told me about this place for awhile. They are here pretty much every week. So, I finally ventured here with them on Saturday.\n\nThe all day menu seems like the no-brainer option here. I ordered hibachi shrimp and zucchini & onions for the sweet carrots. It's 50 cents to swap them. I also went with a tom yum soup since it was a special that day. Hibachi, soup and coke = $14. Not bad at all. I ended up eating part of it the next day for lunch. Hasaki also has a sushi menu, a couple noodle options and dessert. I have to come back and see what this fried ice cream is all about. \n\nOur served was really young, but she was super sweet and attentive. Hasaki seems to do a lot of take out orders. Several people were in and out during our meal to pick up food.\n\nParking options: the Catalyst has a pay garage. Check for street parking. It's free on the weekends and after 6pm on week nights.\n\nI'll definitely back. This may be a new affordable hibachi go-to spot for me.
