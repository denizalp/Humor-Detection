Anything Chef Kenny touches turns into vegan gold. His new restaurant is the perfect place to share a meal with friends or a date. The only thing that's missing is alcohol, but I hear they are working on getting a liquor license! For now I'm content to sip on my Thai iced tea (~$3), which is delightfully thirst-quenching by the way. \n\nI'd recommend starting off your meal with some spring rolls (~$3). On my next visit I plan on trying the BBQ appetizer. Now for the main course, you MUST try the sushi. I am sold on the spicy tuna roll (~$11). My husband got the Kung Pao chicken and loved it. I mean, the menu is huge so it's going to be pretty hard to choose but there's really something from everyone!\n\nThere's also a Yelp deal and a Groupon available, so feel free to splurge. :)\n\nYELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #19
