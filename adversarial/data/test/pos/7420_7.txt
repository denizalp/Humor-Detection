This review is a little late, but I had a different experience compared to all the other yelpers. \n\nWe came in for Thanksgiving Dinner, luckily we got a table right a way. The hostess was very sweet. The ambiance of the restaurant was great, and it's located right inside the mall. \n\nService was great from our waiter and he was very attentive and helpful. My only issue was that when our server was busy and we tried to call someone over but even though other waiters were around and saw our flag down we were totally ignored. \n\nOur food came timely, the spinach and scallop was delish! My only issue was that there was a hair in my lobster mash. I let the waiter know and he kindly took the mash away and asked to replace it. The replacement was delicious but I was already turned off with that hair. \nThat's why I took one star away. I felt that if I'm paying $300+ for a thanksgiving meal, it should come with high quality food, good service at all times, and that doesn't include hair in my food. I requested my steak to be medium well but it was definitely very rare. The meat was under cooked for my taste, and they were nice to recook it but it just took two times for them to make it right. & I'm reallly not a picky eater. It just sucks that the time they spent recooking in sitting there watching my party enjoy their meals. \n\nAll in all, I was dying to try this restaurant and had high hopes for it.. but I would not come back because of the high price tag and the service\/food was not worth the $$
