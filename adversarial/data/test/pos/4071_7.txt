This place is horrible! And that's why I LOVE THEM!\n\nWhere else can you rent a car for $7 dollars a day? No where! If you rent from here be smart! Rent the cheepest car possible. Deny insurance, but make sure you are using a credit card that provides rental car coverage. TAKE 1,000 photos of the car before you leave, and 2,000 photos of the car when you return. \n\nReturn the car like a boss, when you realize you paid $21.00 for car rental for a weekend in Vegas!
