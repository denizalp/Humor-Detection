I needed some breakfast...and I felt like having a breakfast burrito.  Deciding on the Blue Burrito (T4 near A22) , I wasn't too sure what to expect of my breakfast burrito with chorizzo.  All in all I was pleased that it tasted relatively authentic and didn't leave me regreting my decision later on my trip.  It filled me up and left me stuffed for several hours.
