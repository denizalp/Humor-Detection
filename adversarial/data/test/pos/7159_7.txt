Let me tell ya....I usually don't care for Indian food but OMG, this stuff was DELICIOUS! I wasn't feeling well this past weekend so I thought some soup would help. Usually I go to Zupas for soup but they're closed on Sundays and I don't really know of any places that have vegan soups other than Pomegranate Cafe, which is all the way in Ahwatukee so I went onto the trusty Yelp app and looked for Vegan in Chandler, AZ and low and behold Ruchi came up. I browsed their menu and decided to order the Rasam, which is a traditional south Indian sour and spicy soup, and the vegetable briyani. \n\nThe Rasam was full of flavor but was a tad bit on the spicy side. I love spicy food so it was perfect for me. It also helped with my cold. \n\nThe vegetable briyani is aromatic saffron rice with fresh vegetables and fresh herbs. It had such amazing flavor! \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some tasty Indian food.
