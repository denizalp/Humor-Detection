I wasn't sure what to expect of Sky Asian Bistro because the past reviews have been so mixed. I actually really enjoyed the sushi that I ordered and would absolutely go back. I tried three rolls because of their Tuesday promotion of buy two rolls, get one free. Who doesn't love free?\n\nI tried the crunchy salmon roll, a rainbow roll, and the crispy mango tuna roll. All three rolls were really good, but seriously, the mango tuna roll was outstanding. I was still thinking about it a day later. As its name implies, it had mango and tuna, but it also had spicy mayo and a slice of lime. So good! They also have a pretty decent bar list with several options for sake.
