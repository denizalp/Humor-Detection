I needed to rent a large van to accommodate 14 passengers from the airport to our hotel in downtown Pittsburgh.  I'm a huge fan of Yelp and use that to find a reputable company.  Tony Williams almost hit the 5 star mark. Almost.\n\nTony is quick to respond to my calls and emails.  However, there was a lack of little details as time drew closer to my event date, and I didn't get the detail until I already left Los Angeles.  I wasn't worried about my car, as we secured (in writing) my price and the date, but I had no clue who my driver was, or where to meet.  \n\nOn the day of the trip, I got an email asking to reconfirm my headcount.  Fortunately I was checking email during my flight and was able to IMessenger Tony 3000 feet in the air.  I confirmed that I still had 14 passengers but 2 of my members had a full size suitcase. Apparently we needed a larger van or 2 small ones. Tony was able to get 2 vans for us, which worked out afterall.  One van would have been extremely tight for 14 people, so 2 vans made it easier... but naturally the cost went up.  \n\nOur 2 drivers Terry and Brad were excellent drivers. Friendly and chatty but not overly chatty. I got a text from both when they were at the airport, and they waited for us in exit 8.  \n\nTony negotiated a very reasonable price for the extra van, and I tipped our drivers appropriately.  Aside from the miscommunication, I would recommend Tony.  If you're like me, who needs to know stuff in advance, email or call him for the answer.  \n\nKeep in mind that for transporting with luggage, go up a size.  The van he has is for tours and such, without luggage.
