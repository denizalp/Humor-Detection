I somehow lost my toiletry bag on a recent flight back home from Calgary.  Unfortunately inside that bag was all of my make-up, some fabulous face moisturizer, tweezers, perfume, etc... \n\nI went several days without all of this stuff, and despite what my husband says (he hates me in make-up by the way), I didn't feel too pretty.  \n\nSo I made time to visit this Ulta to get a few necessities.  It was my first time at this location and I was pleasantly surprised!  They carry everything I was looking for and oh so much more.  From hair and skin care lines to perfume and make-up.  This Ulta has you covered!\n\nCaution as you shop though:  despite the moderate prices, everything adds up!  I had a $25 gift card and it didn't get me very far!  \n\nIf you are in need of new toiletries like I was and\/or you find yourself looking for cosmetics, fragrance, shampoo, conditioner, a hairdryer, or basically anything to help beautify, this Ulta has you covered!  \n\nAnd while I'd happily shop here again, I hope not to have to for awhile.  Lesson learned: do not put a toiletry bag with everything you own in your suitcase and check it through with your checked baggage, but if you do, Ulta will come to the rescue!
