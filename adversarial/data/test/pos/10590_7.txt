We placed a delivery order at Nick's last night for the first and last time. After a two-hour delivery wait our greasy and undercooked calzone arrived along with an equally greasy and soggy pizza. \n\nThe calzone was pallid doughy inside like ET's skin. On the outside, the crust was crispy brown to burnt black spots. The cheesy filling was a clumpy string of a mess, dotted with a piece of sausage or two.  The calzone was uneatable and quickly found its way to our trash. (I was even afraid to give it to the dogs, fearing a complaint for animal abuse lodged with the humane society.) \n\nThe pizza was only slightly better, in that we were able to actually choke down a few slices. It was soggy to the point where it had melded together with the cardboard box that disguised its appearance.  \n\nIt is a wonder either of those \"treats\" ever made the box. Any respectable employee of this place never would have let product like that  leave the store in the condition it was in. It truly was disgusting. I only wish I could give this mess of a place zero stars.  The way I look at it, Nick's owes me $42 plus tip for the waste of a meal brought to my door.
