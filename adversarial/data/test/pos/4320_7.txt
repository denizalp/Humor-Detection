I don't care that I have to shlep all the way to Namur to sit in a neon lit space with plastic plants for decoration, this restaurant is the bomb. \n\nOh man. The food is so flavorful and so delicious and so cheap that it is the best price\/quality ratio in the city. It's a completely vegetarian restaurant but the food is so umami that even if you do dine on swine you'll leave fully satisfied.\n\nAlso be forewarned that they don't serve booze and it's cash only.
