Owner scratched my car with her door and drove off...I asked for a discount on my two dogs just for Avalanche on my damages. She denied.i never returned ...she has a daughter and husband and I understand they were busy when it happened?but if I would've scratched her vehicle,i bet she wouldn't have just let it go...
