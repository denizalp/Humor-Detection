This place makes me angry and gives me anxiety, I'm not sure why exactly, maybe the fluorescent lights or the stacks and racks of single purpose tech, or the hordes of matching staff everywhere who seem to communicate both that they are vaguely superior to you and in desperate need of a sale.  I've had some good interactions with some smart friendly folks here, don't let me get carried away, but the overall taste in my mouth is sour and To Be Avoided. \n\nIt's two stories and central so that's good. End of the day, just another chain trying to make a buck.
