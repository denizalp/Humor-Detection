This is a newer fantasy location with the same great quality food\/menu. I am so happy to have a Leticia's location closer to Summerlin. Great layout and decor with nice restrooms.\n\nThe carne asada was cooked perfectly and a nice tender cut of meat.\n\nWe look forward to many visits to this location.
