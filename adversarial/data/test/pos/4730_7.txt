Lots of food to choose from but so very crowded. They need more space, it was elbow to elbow. Lines were long, food was expensive and 1\/2 the vendors only accepted cash. I should've brought more cash, I used the ATM machine and it charged me $5 just to use it. They need to use debit cards I mean come on it's 2017!! Take my money!!! I don't carry cash :( My $40 was gone too quick and then most wouldn't take credit\/debit so I stopped spending.
