I have been going here since my junior year in high school and I turn 24 this year. The place is stupid busy on the weekends but that's because they are worth it. The people will get to know you like family. Even after I moved away for two years, they remembered me when I came back! Not to mention the quality of work there is amazing. I have yet to see a place that does hand designs like they do.  Not to mention the owner has been doing nails for like, 16 years!  He's the best nail artist in the place, too.
