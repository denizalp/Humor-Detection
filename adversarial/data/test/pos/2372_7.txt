We spent one night in Las Vegas during a long road trip from Toronto to California. After 3 days in the car, we needed some time sans bebe. \n\nI was given a referral to Nannies & Housekeepers by the Aria Resort where we were staying. They were able to make very last-minute arrangements for us and we had a great babysitter that night. Our son was only going to be sleeping while we were gone, which always lessens my concern when considering a sitter, but Fe Cooper arrived, bright eyed and bushytailed (considering it was like 10 p.m.) with a bag full of age appropriate activities for our 16 month old, which was awesome. \n\nIt's not a cheap service, but given the amount of money you're sure to spend in Vegas anyway, why not enjoy a night out? You can pay the Visa bill later. \n\nI believe there is a one-time admin fee for booking and then it's $45 per hour, with a minimum 4 hour commitment. Well worth it, I think, after spending 40 hours driving, making up songs about the desert, enduring shitty motels in Omaha and eating every meal sitting in a car seat. \n\nReally fantastic.
