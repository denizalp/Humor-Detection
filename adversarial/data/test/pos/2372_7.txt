Nice big hello when you walk in!\n\nI had an irregular order and they fixed it quickly and well.\n\nIt nice to be able to see my meal prepared, even if it's quick serve.\n\nIt is about 'butt-cold degrees' outside and this place was warm and I was very comfortable.\n\nThe prep-station was clean and it was kinda cool that the staff was singing (on key) and happy.\n\nIf we play on this side of town again, I will ABSOLUTELY eat here again.
