We've been to a couple of other comedy clubs in the Phoenix area and finally decided to go to the Tempe Improv on a Saturday night. Chris Titus was here and we had heard really good things about his show so we had high expectations. We didn't pre-purchase tickets, just got them right at the door. They were a bit slow in this process for whatever reason, however we had gotten there early enough so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nWe were seated in the middle area towards the back so we had a pretty good vantage point of the stage. The middle\/big isle was behind me so I didn't feel cramped. I'd definitely recommend getting there about a half hour or so early, if not earlier, because the tables started filling up really fast after we got there. I imagine a lot of the shows are just as popular as the one we went to and fill up in the same way.\n\nI definitely enjoyed the show! Chris Titus is a funny guy. If you're not a fan of kids or don't mind poking fun at parenthood, this is definitely a good show for you to see!\n\nAdditionally, the service during the show was good. We were greeted upon arrival and ordered drinks right away. Since there was a two drink minimum, we made it easy and told our server to get us a round of the same thing when he came by halfway through the show. I think it would definitely be a good idea if you want something different than what you originally order to just tell your server beforehand. There were some people a few seats away from us who were have a conversation multiple times with the waiter while the show was happening. It was a bit distracting to us as well as others around us.\n\nKeep in mind this ends up being a fairly expensive date night. It was $50 for 2 tickets ($25 each), and the specialty cocktails were about $70 (2 drink minimum, so 4 total drinks each at $14 plus tax & 15% gratuity automatically added). I'm sure there are other options that satisfy the 2 drink minimum at a much lower price though. It was a fun experience for us, so we'll return.
