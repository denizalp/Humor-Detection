OH.\nMY.\nGOSH.\nListen, I *know* hair.  Besides the fact that I was voted \"most likely to become a hairdresser\" in HS, I've always been pretty hip to styles, color and product.\nWent to Chris today (male).  I told him he could do whatever he wanted.  After all, the company was paying for it.  \nI have about 4 different shades of red in my hair and it looks great!  Smooth, silky, shiny.\nNow, for the salon itself:  GORGEOUS!  It's big.  I've never been to such a big salon!  I usually go to Way Cool Hair in the PHX, which is small and way more intimate.  It works for Prova, though!  The salon stations were all very clean and well-kept.  Designer furniture scattered throughout.  All the stylists looked happy to be there.  People of all ages were getting their hair done.  I had to wait for Chris to do a boy's hair, about 10 years old, before I got my butt in the chair.\nI took a tour of the place.  These people do EVERYTHING!  Hair (color, perm, cut); Nails (mani and pedi); massages, facials.  You name it!  \nThough I only got a cut and color, I WILL be back to get my nails done and maybe even a facial!\n*DISCLAIMER* I work for their sister company, so I don't know what the cost was.  This review is legit, though!  I love Prova!!!!!
