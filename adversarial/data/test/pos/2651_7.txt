When you're really craving pizza , you're a vegan and it's almost 10pm at night ? COME HERE ! They won't short change you and close 15 mins early like the other place across the way . My husband & I were craving pizza one night after the gym , I knew I was cutting it close because it was almost 10pm and most places close around then . I went to the place across the street originally and sadly was completely ignored even though they still had 15 mins to close and the place was full . Did the employee come open the door even after making eye contact with me ? You bet she didn't . So as I started to pout , I remembered Pieology was literally right across the street ( earlier that month we went by , but it hadn't opened ) ! The heavens opened up and the guy was sooo sweet when we walked in - even though it was 10 mins until closing time their customer service was a breathe of fresh air ( or a fresh slice of pizza if you like C H E E S Y jokes - see what I did there ? Lol ) anyway , they made our pizza , including having the option of vegan cheese and it was everything I was craving . Will absolutely be back again and again . Thanks Pieology , you saved this hangry girl from disappointment !
