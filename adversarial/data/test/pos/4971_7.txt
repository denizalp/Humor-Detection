Mathew's review of the day reminded me that i owe a review on this place. Unfortunately , i don't share in his love for the place. \n\nElnino hit the nail on the head - WTF is with all the frosting !! \n\nBought a dozen to take to my old office mates on the eastside . the ladies in the office luv da sweets big time !! I've tried to keep them satisfied with the freebies i get from the Palms coffee shop ( brownies, cannoli and this cheesecake \" loaf \" that's pretty damn good ! ) , the Eastside cannery deli ( more brownies and cookies ) and my occasional stop at the various cupcake shops. \n\nWhen i saw Mathew's review of Gigi and noticed it's about 2 miles from the old office, of course i had to try ! \n\nGot a variety of 8 different cupcakes and i'm not sure what bothered me more - the ridiculous amount of the frosting or how frickin dry the cake was ...is that why they pile on the frosting ?!?! \n\nUsually I give a place a couple tries before i throw-down an opinion but it's my sense this is the 'norm' for these cupcakes and i just can't get past the frosting pile ...please please please Retro ...OPEN A 2ND STORE IN CENTRAL VEGAS
