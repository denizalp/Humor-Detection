Room ..... 4 stars, kind of Funky and fresh with great views. I found a little bit weird that right above the hot tub was a picture of Fonzy from Happy days, kind of weird, I would have preferred Marilyn or Sophia\n\nFree bottle of Booze with every room....   5 stars\n\nPlanet Hollywood is so 2009\n\nSwimming pool...... 0 star, I fell like I was at a Motel 6. My advice is to stay at PH but go to a better pool\n\nThe club Prive was .....one star
