Are you kidding me? My dad and I got an Uber from our hotel and we could not find the La Hacienda. I called La Hacienda and asked them for directions and the girl acted like I was stupid. We ran into a security guard in a booth and he tried to give us directions. We went through security gates and still could not find La Hacienda. We drove around parking lots, side streets, behind buildings, etc. and still could not find it. We ended up going back to our hotel.\n\nI researched this more and found out that the La Hacienda is in a resort and the address listed on their website as well as YELP is for the resort and not the actual restaurant so Google Maps only got us close to the restaurant but NOT to the actual restaurant.\n\nIf this was my business I would make darn sure the address listed on Yelp & my website was accurate so that people using Google maps could find it. - DUH!!!
