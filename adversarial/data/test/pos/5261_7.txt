The food is nice, but the service OMG! But the service is HORRIBLE! The \"waiter\" laughed at me since the first moment I asked for a virgin daikiry. He appeared in my table with TAP WATER... I wanted something without alcohol coz I cannot drink. I told him this was not what I asked for and his answer was (pointing the entrance door)  \"SECURITY IS RIGHT THERE\" Couldn't believe my eyes. WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE. RACIST STAFF!!!!!  \nBad bad bad bad bad! If you are not white American, please stay home!
