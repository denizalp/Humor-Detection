I could get gross and gushy about this obscenely awesome comic convention, so I'm just going to keep it concise and make a list:\n\nCheap, $15 a day\nLots (LOTS) of trades and resales available\nTons of collectibles, toys, video, posters, etc\nDippin' Dots \nBig names come, a longer list each year\nSmall names too - Indie Island is huge and stuffed with talent, online and print\nThere's beer\nAnd pizza\nSolution to not being a crowd person - come on Sunday\n\nIf you haven't been, tsk tsk. Next year's is only 350-something days away - could be time for a forehead tatt.
