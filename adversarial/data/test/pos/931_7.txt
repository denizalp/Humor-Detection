For my last meal on earth, I'd cut myself a huge chunk of Cheskie's chocolate babka for dessert. And possibly for the main course too. In fact, I'd eat these bad boys every day of the week if only I had adequate dental insurance and if Cheskie's were to open on Saturdays. They are amazingly moist and the amount of chocolate lacing through the dough is serious business. My other favourite is their cheese pastry which is shaped like a flower. It's not as sweet as the chocolate babkas, but just as comforting. Perhaps I'd have that for my second last dessert on earth.
