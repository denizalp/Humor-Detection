Ahh yes, The Farm Kitchen at The Farm At South Mountain. I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.\n\nWhile they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of $22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, $22) for lunch and that was no tip included.\n\nWhy no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.\n\n$22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, $10 to $12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to $22.\n\nAnd honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn. I'm not sure why all you people are so WOW about this place. I'm never going back.
