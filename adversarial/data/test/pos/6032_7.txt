I'm a fan! Especially of their asada- one tortilla, guac, and char; simple and delicious. Their $2\/taco rate is fair for the amount of meat they stuff in these babies. I do wish they'd add an actual salsa bar, but being able to get fresh-grilled peppers and onions is always a nice perk.\n\nLike I said, the asada is my preference here at Taco TJ. The suadero is nice and spicy, the al pastor lacked the crispy bits and pineapple I was craving, and the lengua could have been a bit softer. Note that lengua here goes for $2.25. Have yet to try the tripas.\n\nProps to the staff for being quick and helpful- they had no problem packing and labeling our massive order. Though I don't live nearby, I like that they are open til 1AM. Follow them on social media for alerts about their sales and discounts.
