I'm purely basing this review on the fact that this deep dish Chicago style pizza is AMAZING. \n\nIf you are as obsessed with cheese as I am, this is the place for you. The cheese pull on this pizza could stretch to the celling. And I'm not exaggerating, I genuinely believe that if you had arms long enough I think it would be possible. \n\nThe flavor is amazing. I personally love the Super Veggie and the Chicago Classic and obviously ask for like 10 sides of ranch. Obviously the star of the show is the filling, cheese and sauce. But, I think one of the best things about this particular deep dish is the crust. It's flakey, buttery, and almost like a pot pie crust. So fantastic. \n\nIf you do want to order a deep dish, be prepared to wait. It takes about 45 minutes to cook that thick bad boy. Totally worth it. The plus side is they have bomb salads and appetizers to chow down on while you wait for that cheesy, circle of heaven.\n\nSo happy you're here Giordanos. SO HAPPY.
