This place is located right next to Fat Burger... I wanted some quick food on my way home. I love Fat Burger, but I wanted to try something new.... next time I'm in the area I'll probably just hit up Fat Burger\n\nThis place is ok. No green sauce, first strike.\nThe tacos are pretty good sized... Be careful when ordering, it seems super cheap, but by the time you add all the good stuff... it adds up. Although it was still under $10 for two tacos, rice and beans. There was a lot of food.. I \n\nThe ingredients taste fresher than your normal Mexican drive thru, and the staff was friendly. I think the main thing holding me back, is no green sauce.
