I think this is where reality TV Stars go to die. Like die in the \"my career is dead\" die. Not the literal. I honestly felt bad watching it. Because the cast came out here to show their talent and then the show \"star,\" Daisy, is famous for dating an F list celeb.\n\nI'm giving it two starts instead of one because the cast wasn't bad. They weren't the most talented, but you could see that sparkle every once in a while. Daisy was most definitely lip syncing and kinda hopping around, instead of really performing. \n\nI also felt bad because there was probably 20 people in a most likely 300-400 plus seating area. When people clapped, it sounded like one person was clapping. It was just awful. I guess that's what you get when you buy tickets at a mega discount. \n\nI'll stick to the Cirque shows, were at least I know what I\"m getting. And no washed up reality stars!
