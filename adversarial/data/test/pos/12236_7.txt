I will say this place is conceptually cool, with the lodge theme and all their taxidermy as well as offering a topless 21+ alcohol side and a fully nude 18+ dry side to transition to and from as you please.\nHowever, the cover is ridiculous, and the drink prices are nothing less than criminal. You'd think as the charges accrue the dancers here must be drop dead gorgeous, but i've seen much more attractive women in cheaper joints. I noticed hardly anyone at all shelling out cash for the dancers themselves, probably because you feel so robbed before you've even sat down.\nAnd then I did sit down, in a chair that smelled like an indoor playplace. Not sexy. The music varies from alternative rock to rap to techno to hard rock so frequently that no one can possibly enjoy even half of what they're condemned to hear.\nThere are a ton of other strip clubs within a small radius of here, so I would recommend driving a block or two in any direction to stay out of this one.
