Floyd Lamb is a wonderful park with animals that poop on the ground; yes, it's true.  It happens when animals roam around.  Other reviews bring up the poop factor, but it hasn't really bothered me that much when I've visited.  I've seen dog poop, duck poop, bird poop, horse poop, but not peacock poop, maybe because I don't know how to identify theirs.  As long as it's not ratched people poop, I'm good.  On the other hand, I don't come to Floyd Lamb to sit at the tables and picnic, either.  I run the trails and around the park and this is what I give the stars to the most.  The trail system is used by humans as well as horses and dogs: look out for the poop!  It's not that rocky, but rather compacted dirt, so you don't have to worry too much about turning an ankle or looking down the whole time you're running.  There are lots of covered seating areas on the trail if you want to stop and enjoy the views, as well as dog poop bags and trash cans if you're the responsible dog owner type.  Bikers can also use the trails.  There are ponds at the park with ducks of all sizes and they're not skittish around humans, so you can really get up close and personal with them.  Peacocks roam around, too, but not usually near the water, but closer to the farm buildings when I've seen them.  You'll see things at this park that you won't at others around town, so I recommend it if you want a nice change of pace; just watch where you're stepping.\n\n$6 daily entry fee\n$50 for the annual pass\nWinter hours:  9:00am-5:00pm\nSummer hours:  8:00am-8:00pm
