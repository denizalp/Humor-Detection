My comfort zone extends no more west than Avenue Road, and on a gloomy Saturday morning, I was forcibly taken out of that zone, and brought to the intersection of Honest Ed's, and lead to a door I would have otherwise never noticed, if it weren't for the giant eyeball signage staring at all oncoming pedestrians. Surprisingly, I did not put up much of a fight when being instructed to go inside. \nDon't stare at it!\n\nWe were met by an unfriendly Chinese Maitre'D, she did not offer me a single smile, or much of an acknowledgment at all aside from telling us that it'll be a ten minute wait. \nHold on, we don't have reservations?!?!\nARGH!\nOkay, I didn't end up waiting too long, I think it was because there were only two of us, and my unending ambient complaining propelled our names on the top of the list. I don't feel bad, she didn't smile at me.\n\nI had trouble understanding the menu, I haven't had brunch since boarding school. It always just appeared as if it was lackluster effort lunch, with eggs. I ended up getting the AAA steak and eggs, and my friend got the eggs benedict. \nWhen the waiter asked me what I wanted for a beverage, I told him Redbull & vodka. I was met with a \"Seriously?\" Then he proceeded to tell me a story about another person ordering alcohol around the same time of the day. It was 1:30pm. Regardless, I was at a nerve away from decking him between the teeth. I don't need to be judged by my service staff. I just returned from Asia not a week ago, the service industry in North America has all dissipated to the air of shabbiness for me. I don't like hipsters. This place offers brunch til 3pm. I'm not the one with the f&%ked up hours okay.\nI had no idea what to expect, and my expectations for this place dropped considerably after seeing the horrendous sign, and being greeted by a Asian Racheal lookalike (think Blade Runner[that was a compliment]).\nBut, and a big but. Despite the fact this place was absolutely buzzing, and our table was just about the size of the dishes itself, somehow everything seemed to fall in place perfectly.\nThe obscure art on the wall wasn't displeasing, the lack of decor complimented the industrial tone of the walls, the uncomfortable looking couches were actually not uncomfortable at all. I can relax here, it's a miracle!\n\nThe food came. Triple A my ass..\nBut the home fries was bloody good. Not sure what sauce it was drenched with, maybe barbecue. The scrambled eggs didn't do anything for me. The eggs benedict was alright, but honestly, I don't like meals that resemble breakfast. \n\nWith everything said, my time here was not by any means, unbearable. This was supposedly my friend's favorite restaurant, and if I squint very hard, I suppose I can see why. The atmosphere is very engaging, and the crowd equally so. I can see this place offering shisha. It was overall very...chill.\n\n\nThe bill came in a metallic bowl, weighed down with a good sized piece of rock.\nI scanned the area for the Maitre'D...
