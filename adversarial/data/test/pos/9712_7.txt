what the Hell-when did they only gay bar on the Westside go straight? What an Effin' shame...\nAnywho, back to the task at hand. I love a good, friendly, divey bar. This place has it all: nice bartenders who pour a mean drink, good jukebox, cheap prices, pool\/darts, and this place has had a patio where you can take your drink out for a long time-even before the ban. Granted, it's not the prettiest place, but it's not a shabby hole either. Sure you might get a crazy guy wander in from Crip-Town across the way, but they seem to get the picture pretty quick-you are welcome as long as you don't annoy the animals. everyone seems to get along just swell. Good place for a drink or two after work when you don't feel pretty enough for Cobalt, but not quite slummy enough for Cruisin' 7th.
