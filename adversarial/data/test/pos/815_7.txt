The French onion soup.\n\nThat's what this review is for - because it's amazing. Seriously, please order this. \n\nThe atmosphere of 300 East is cozy and romantic. The servers and staff have always been friendly to me and helpful. They do however, make you wait until your entire party is there to be seated. The lobby space is very small, so it makes waiting uncomfortable if you've come in more than one car. But once you are seated, it's beautiful, warm, welcoming. And the french onion soup is to die for. I'm so glad that I ordered it. \n\nIt comes out in a crock with cheese everywhere. It's salty, and comforting and amazing. Our server was very helpful too. My mom ordered one of the drink specials on a whim and he offered to comp it if she didn't like it. \n\nSo, in short, I will come back here time and time again for that soup. And I might branch off the menu too, the burgers are suppose to be good.
