OMFG FRESH TASTY OYSTERS for under $2 a piece? And you get various oysters to choose from from the east coast? This is what I'm talking about. Vegas needed a place like this on this side of town that's not near the strip. \n\nI did not expect such a hip modern feel from this place. Nice and bright during the day and probably dark and romantic at night. They have a full bar, open kitchen, and plenty of seating throughout the place. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had a tasting of all the oysters and found that we loved NY Prime and the Fanny Bay oysters the best. They also come with two sauces that are freshly made! I also tried their Agatha cocktail and it was refreshing and sweet! Definitely will try other ones next time! \n\nWe also ordered:\n\nAMBERJACK CRUDO $11: my favorite dish! It was sour and sweet and worked perfect with the ponzu salsa!\n\nSUSHI SAMPLER $15: it was okay honestly. There was a lot of rice and it almost looked like brown rice was mixed in. The tuna was a little fishy also. I liked how the Chef Dan added the mantis shrimp! That's a new one I always wanted to try. \n\nPORK BELLY KIMCHI FRIED RICE: I loved how it came out still sizzling hot! It kinda lacked in flavor and I wished the kimchi was more fermented and had that sour touch to it. The pork belly was delicious though and had many large savory pieces in it! Plus the mushrooms gave it a great kick to it. \n\nSpicy Yuzu Wings $13: Am I the only one who didn't like it? I liked how crispy they were and it wasn't over breaded but it was missing flavor in the actual meat. I honestly didn't like the sauce they used to spread on one side either. It just tasted like sirracha and Yuzu mixed together. For $13 I kinda expect more than 5 wings. \n\nI can't wait to try their fresh live scallops and more raw seafood! Definitely will come back and try other things to see what I like.
