***** UPDATE *****\nOwner \"Alex\" will harass you via message if he does not agree with your negative review threatening legal action. I've noticed on other negative reviews he likes to attack people and disclose personal information. Perfect example of how business is conducted at Auto Junction.\n\n\nSHADY BUSINESS!! Would never purchase a vehicle here again. They sold me a vehicle that needed a major repair & made the \"exception\" to do the repair but in reality after having the vehicle several days, they never made the repair they claimed they made. Crooked liars, buyer beware.
