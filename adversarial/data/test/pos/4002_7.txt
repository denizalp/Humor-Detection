Came here for brunch and ordered the lobster and filet mignon benedict because it sounded interesting. In my opinion, the flavors of the benedict did not go well together. The hollandaise sauce was heavy, and the English muffin was on the soggy side. My friends got the shrimp benedict and the lobster and asparagus omelet, both of which they seemed to enjoy. As Bonefish is a seafood restaurant, I think I'd probably have better luck ordering from the lunch or dinner menu. \n\nService was good- no complaints there. Will try something different if I find myself back here again.
