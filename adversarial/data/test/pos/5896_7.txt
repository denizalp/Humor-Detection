My heart broke when I learned about a reviewers experience with the mule dying in front of her. I can't imagine watching an animal die like that without proper care and learning that G Adventures exploits people and their services in developing countries. Shame on them. \n\nI on the other hand only just learned of that review. And I am glad that I didn't become a customer. \n\nI am an unsatisfied almost customer of  G Adventure. \n\nAbout two weeks ago,  i learned that I would be going to Germany for a work related event. This seemed like a wonderful opportunity to join a  tour while in Europe. I have not been on a group tour before and my work week is too packed to find time to create my own travel on such short notice. \n\nTo make a long story short, in the confirmation I was sent, therein lied one sentence. The room that I was going to be booked in was a private room, not a shared room. I didn't need a private room and stated that in my initial call. The confirmation email was very long (probably at minimum one full page plus of text) and this message was buried in that text. I hadn't asked for a private room; the single supplement was $1200 more than than a shared room and I knew that I was okay with sharing. That is quite expensive given that Rick Steves offers $700 additional  for a private room and if they can't find a person to share with you, you still get the private room at no cost. \n\nAlmost six days later, when I was about to book, and had made arrangements to coordinate with business travel, to have someone watch my home, to make plane arrangements from Germany to italy, and all during an extremely swamped stressed work week. . .and I was in constant communication with G Travel, I learned about the private room on the day I wanted to pay for the tour. They said, it was in the email. \n\nHuh? I literally had to look hard for the sentence. I asked them to accommodate. They didn't want to and probably thought that they'd find someone that would pay the $2800, normally $1600 for shared. i asked if they could find a room near where the group was staying, etc.; they simply would not accommodate. \n\nI was disappointed with my experience and  the lack of customer service. It was their mistake, not mine, and they didn't want to take responsibility. The solutions they provided for me were a) I could share the bed with a stranger b) I could go on another tour that was in the same timeframe (none of which were interesting or active enough) or c) pay the single supplement. They lost me as a new customer.
