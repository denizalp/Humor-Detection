Guess what? I like pretending to be a chef. To fool people, you need to play the part and own super awesome kitchen gear. Since I'm just pretending, I don't like to buy things at retail. SRS saves the day in that regard. Many of their items are priced below Amazon or other local retailers. That being said, the rest are not. It's kinda hit or miss on many of the items. Also, I tried to buy a ton of paper goods, plastic cups, etc. and the selection was weak. I literally bought every 12-16oz cup they had and they were not cheap. Overall, SRS is A-OK in my book and should be for you too, if you're looking for some sweet kitchen\/serving gear.
