My visit here was because it was convenient to where I was at the time. With a small\/busy parking lot, there are probably easier places to access than this. I found it to be a bit on the spendy side unless you have a \"frequent flier\" account with them, in which case you'll have access to some discounts and BOGOs.\n\nIt was a decent enough shopping experience and I was able to locate the two items I needed, get them rung up quickly and be on my way.\n\nIt was A-OK.
