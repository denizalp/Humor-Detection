I'm so happy that Grouchy John's finally has it's own store. It's a definite bonus that it's right down the street from my house. I plan on spending many Sunday mornings hanging out with friends and drinking great coffee!\n\nI usually get a morning coffee but the smoothies are excellent. If you're feeling adventurous, just let John create a custom drink for you. Trust me it'll be tasty. You'll also get a chance to name your own drink and get it up on the menu!\n\nGrouchy John's is also very active on Facebook and Twitter so if you have any questions or comments, you know you'll receive a quick response.\n\nAs a bonus, if you have an iPhone you can download Square's Card Case app and just pay with your phone!\n\nI'm on a mission to create my own custom drink so be on the lookout for \"The Shewchuk\"
