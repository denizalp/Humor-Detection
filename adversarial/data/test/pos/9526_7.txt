This is a place worth driving half an hour for, and I've done it a couple times this year already.\n\nThe rotisserie chicken is prepared with tandoori flavours and roasted tender and juicy. Fries and double fried ( I think) and are some of the best I've had. And the coleslaw, my favourite coleslaw.\n\nThey could make the Caesar salad a bit less salty and they could maybe use one more helping hand ( or more efficient ). The girl at the front does everything from cashier to bartender to server to putting fries into the fryer...while two other guys in the kitchen do much less...\n\nWith all of the above, still a five star for me
