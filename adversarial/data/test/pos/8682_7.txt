I was told to bring my kiddos here by a friend and I'm glad I did. \nI must have drove past this place a thousand times and never noticed it was there.\n\nThe ladies in here didn't speak much English and luckily I knew enough to say what I wanted done plus a had a pic handy lol. \nthey were really nice and did a great job on my daughters hair!\n\nI liked that they had cartoons on and a little play area to keep the kids busy while we waited. \nKids cuts are only 7.50 so the price is amazing!\nI will be bringing my little princess back when she needs a touch up!
