I've been five times and am about done with it.\n\nThey purposely want to keep giant, hulking meat heads out, which is good, but they do it by restricting equipment that even non-meatheads use. Let me illustrate this in the cons and then I'll move onto the pros.\n\nCons\n- There's no long barbell, the type you would see someone doing a deadlift with. The dead lift is used by all athletes and is a great exercise for everyone. This also means one cannot do a bench press, unless it's on a smith machine. There are many exercise to do with a long barbell, but the long barbell isn't there specifically so meat heads don't sign up. \n\n- The short barbells (shoulder width ones,) only go up to 60 pounds.  That is not enough weight.\n\n-No medicine balls or kettle bells.\n\n-No resistance bands allowed, and you aren't allowed to bring them in. These are great for hitting alot of different areas. \n\n-Too many of the same type of machine. There's a whole wall dedicated to hip abduction\/aduction, why?\n\n-Many of the machines you do want to use are in the \"30 minute Circuit Training\" area. You're not supposed to enter this area if you aren't there to do the whole 30 minutes.\n\n-You're not allowed to bring in hand straps. The rationale being you shouldn't be using weight heavy enough to use them? What if you have weak wrists?\n\n-They offer Pizza Monday to \"keep people coming in.\" This makes no nutritional sense what so ever. They sponsor \"The Biggest Looser?\"\n\n- No Towels provided. This irks me more and more as I was accustomed to it at my last place. \n\n- No place should advocate UV tanning. \n\n-They don't allow personal trainers\n\nPros\n- It's 10$ a month with no early termination fee\n\n-Good AC\n\n-Plenty of cardio!\n\n-Plenty of Ab stuff... New people to fitness irrationally love tons of ab equipment, and Planet Fitness obliges this wayward thinking. They should use the floor spaces for better machines or a squat rack. \n\nPlanet Fitness is a gym for those who don't want to be intimidated by muscle beach freaks who want to rip your head off. That's noble, but they dumb down the options so much that they eliminate even the midrange people. What's left is a place for a person who want's to get fit, but isn't given the tools to do it in.
