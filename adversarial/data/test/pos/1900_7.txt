First time here and definitely returning. The atmosphere is nice. I love the furniture, it's VERY retro. It's a small place but you don't feel claustrophobic. The food was EXCELLENT. I loved the cucumber salad and I had the 12pc SASHIMI. My friends had the all you can eat sushi and raved about it. The service was FANTASTIC.
