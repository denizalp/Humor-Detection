I was skeptical of a trendy indian restaurant opened by Quebecors so close to the best neighborhood in town for authentic Indian food. However, I was pleasantly surprised because this is not just a fusion place, they respected the ingredients and added a lot more varieties in their Thali. Ok, it is $3-5 more expensive than traditional Thahi, but they also have 1) more variety of fresh vegetables 2) less sauce and more meat 3) some kind of spice to flavor the rice- nice touch and very delicious. --In fact, you might first had the illusion that the portion is small because they 'packed' the vege and meat into smaller containers than traditional thali and reduce the sauce\n\nThese days, all \"authentic\" indian restaurants more or less have a similar menu in Montreal (not the case in Toronto or Vancouver). There should be more restaurants like \"Le Super Qualit√©\" to challenge the traditional way of doing business by introducing new items on the Indian food theme in Montreal. \nBesides, my 'addiction' for an authentic Lamb Vindaloo won't stop me from visiting other classic Indian restaurants such as Punjab palace or Chand palace at all. \n\nps: the place is tiny and cute, so it's more for a 2-person sit-down meal or take-out. Cocktail list seems interesting, definitely will try next time.
