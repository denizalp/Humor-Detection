It is close to my house and that is probably the only reason I ended up ordering an $7.99 pan pizza with green peppers and pepperoni. The dough is fine and it basically is a pizza you order in a pinch. Considering I can't recall ordering a pizza from Domino's in years, my pinch moments are few and far between. The prices are cheaper on the weekdays, so since most folks order out on weekends, this chain is making a mistake on strategy.
