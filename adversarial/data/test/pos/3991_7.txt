I won't be back. Can't recommend this place. I ordered sisig and it arrived warm. Nothing on this plate was hot.\nThe spring rolls were piping hot and actually tasted fresh. Maybe the main chef was off and his apprentice was covering for him while getting over a cold. Just no.\nThe halo-halo was on point. Can't really mess this one up.. just dump all the ingredients in a cup and add a spoon. \nI won't be back and can't recommend this place to anyone I care about.
