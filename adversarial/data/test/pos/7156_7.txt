As a native Detroiter, I grew up on Coney Islands, as their a staple.  Most people have a favorite one, and when I left Detroit, I found that Phoenix doesn't really have any Coney Islands.  When a friend told about this place and how it just opened, I KNEW I had to go try it, and today I did just that.\n\nUpon entering, the place is in a tired little strip mall, but inside its the closest thing I can get to a Detroit Coney.  The menu is large and ample, with lots of Detroit goodies, such as a coney dog with all the fixings (chili, onions, etc.) Gyros, greek salads, fries and a whole bunch of other items that are made as they should be. I liked the fact that the menu spanned the entire back wall and was on huge flat screen TV's.  They also have some Detroit memorabilia on the walls of old car stuff which was really cute, and the interior was simply decorated with an open window to the grill so you could see the cook making your food as the girl took the order.\n\nOverall the food was good. I went with the Gyro and fries with a coke, and it came out tasty!  it was a bit garlicly, but in a good way.  I had also wanted to get a greek salad, but I knew there was no way I could eat all that food in one sitting, so I passed. I still have to try the coney dogs, as they have a few options here (Chicago, Detroit and Phoenix style dogs) but I think I will get that next time I go.\n\nThey had a steady stream of people coming in and out on a Sunday afternoon, and the girl behind the counter was busy as all get out.   The only thing that suffered was I got my food a good 5 minutes before my friend did, so bad timing on her part. I hate when that happens!  My friend didn't mind and neither did I, but I could have waited to eat (which I did) and that was probably the only thing with the meal that didn't go right. Every thing else was awesome!\n\nIf your from Detroit, back east, or just want some seriously good coney food, come here. Its like a little slice of home.  Local business support as well, and worth a trip for those of you who like this kind of stuff. Enough of a menu selection and a good price point to keep everyone happy and guarantee that you'll walk out with a full stomach like I did!  They also have a rockin breakfast menu as well!
