Talk about a huge selection of candy! I have never seen a candy store with this large of a variety of things to choose from.\n\nThey have all of the usual stuff and all of the unusual stuff too. Pez dispensers of all kinds, over sized stuff, rare and hard to find candy and most interestingly... ADULT XXX type of candy, if you know what I mean.\n\nYou can buy prepackaged candy or walk around with a bag and mix and match your candy. The bags have lines that go by 1\/4 of a pound to help with your budgeting. You can also use the scales to weigh your food as you go.\n\nThis place was a lot of fun and I highly recommend coming here if you are in town.
