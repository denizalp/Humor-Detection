After reading these reviews, I went to The Living Room for a haircut.    \n\nAfter getting a very bad haircut, I now realize that these overly praiseful reviews are obviously written by the staff who work there.\n\nFrancesco had no rhyme or reason in his haircutting method.  He just randomly picked at my head looking for longer pieces.\n\nThe only plus is that it was 20 bucks for the haircut.  If you are broke and in dire need of a trim, go here.  Otherwise, LOOK ELSEWHERE!  You are not going to get a good haircut here. \n\n(I signed up for an account just to tell the truth about this place.)
