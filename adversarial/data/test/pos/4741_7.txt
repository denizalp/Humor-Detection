A higher class Hooters, just as tacky but with good food.\n\nI do enjoy going to this place because the food is pretty good and it's right next to the Marriott Courtyard which serves microwaved food. However you can't help but feel like a creep going into the place. 99% of the staff are attractive girls wearing low tops and short short skirts. 99% of the patrons are overweight business men who like to stare at ass. \n\nWho doesn't? Right? I don't know. It's still creepy.
