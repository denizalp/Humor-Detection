This one was a hard one... I LOVED the food, but man, that meat baby stayed with me for THREE DAYS. Not only did I wake up at 4am in the morning feeling like I had rocks in my stomach, it literally was three days before I got rid of it. For those of you cringing, count yourself lucky that that is as gross as that description got. I had a much more graphic way of explaining it but decided to tone it down a little for the TMI Police.\n\nSo, moving on...\n\nThere's little in the way of seating at this place. Well, there's a moderate amount but like any popular food joint, you're not doing it right unless there's a queue out the door and people willing to wait it out. I ordered the double burger (and was surprised that it impregnated me with a meat baby, I know, not exactly the sharpest tool in the box) and it was delicious. The bread didn't stand a chance with all that cheese, mayo and GREASE, but oh was it fabulous. It handled it all perfectly, and only really gave in towards the end, soaking through in the spots where I was clamping down on it with my fingers.\n\nThe beef ... my God, the beef! I've had some nice burgers but this was exceptionally good. My boyfriend had the pulled pork and he said that while it was good, there was a lot of sauce, which kind of overpowered it all. He would have liked to have been able to taste the flavour of the pork a little more. Our friend had the fried chicken, which he devoured. Watching him, my boyfriend went back in and got an order to take home. Watching them made my tummy want to cry but they said the chicken was great.\n\nI also ordered one of their cute lemonades. They come with a little papery straw that discourages nursing your drink (it just turned to muuuush!) but the pop was lovely.\n\nPricewise, it's a little on the expensive side, considering it's \"just a burger.\" Really, though, you need to go to realise it's more than a burger. It's fabulous. Minus one star because there's been no child support for that meat baby I was saddled with. I was not sorry to see the back of that!
