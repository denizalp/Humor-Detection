This place is a true gem, a special spot for dessert and wine where the food is as beautiful as it is delicious. Part of the appeal is watching dishes be created in front of you. They no longer use the edible menu. Instead a more traditional printed menu with pictures and descriptions is used. A 2 course dessert pairing ($15) is listed in place of the previous 3 course option. I inquired about the 3 courses and the accommodated me. \n\nTo start was a smooth and light strawberry sorbet with jelly, followed by the perfectly light for summer Mt. Exotic. Its subtle sweetness and crispy base were topped with a spongey cake and mango cream with tartness and acidity added from a raspberry sauce. My wife ordered the Ringo ($12) a la carte. It's a gorgeous and well crafted apple pie. The caramelized apples were covered by a crispy lattice crust, next to it was honey ice cream and an apple-shaped object made of sugar and filled with cream and caramel. It's an absolute must when visiting this place and one of the better desserts I've had in town. Ending the meal was a delicate and flaky cream puff filled with a semi sweet chocolate cream and raspberry sauce.\n\nService was excellent. The interior is stark white, clean and pristine. The chef's work station is something to behold. It's immaculate. It's interesting to watch her work. Even when she's rushing around preparing dishes she takes the time to keep everything clean and organized.
