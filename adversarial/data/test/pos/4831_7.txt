Called Gary today at 8am.  He was here within a few hours and fixed my kitchen sink that I clogged. He found a leak under the sink as well and fixed that, too! He's professional and friendly and his work ethic makes him my go to plumber since his first time to my house in January 2015.  \nI plan to call him again next week to fix a few leaky faucets that he couldn't do today since he squeezed me in to get my kitchen sink back in order.  \nThank you, Gary!
