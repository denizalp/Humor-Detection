How have I not reviewed this railroad park before? I have been coming to this park for over 30 years with my family. \n\nHighlights: \n*For just $2 per ride you can take the train or ride the carousel 365 days per year.\n*The FREE model train building is beyond awesome. Dozens of trains of different gauges and towns, scenery, and decorations that are creative and interactive with handprint buttons at child level. These a maintained by 3 model railroad clubs.\n*Weekends Live Steam trains (mini trains that carry children) run.\n*Extremely nice playground.\n*Western town play area.\n*Covered picnic ramadas.\n*Snack shop and general store.\n*Train museum\/Presidential dining car ($2 admission).\n*Clean restrooms.\n*Holiday decorations throughout the park.\n*Lots of open, well maintained spaces for kids to run and play.\n*Ample, free, well-maintained parking and walk areas with plenty of shaded benches.\n\nI love this place. It is a real Scottsdale treasure.
