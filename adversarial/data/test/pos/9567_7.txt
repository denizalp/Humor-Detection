since we love poke and this place is just like a mile from the house we REALLY REALLY wanted to like it... the first time we went in to check it out was a couple of months ago and we had a weird feeling about it bc they were out of alot of items, the prices wer super high and the girl at the register made us more confused than ever.  so we didnt order anything, kindly took a to go menu and said \"thanku we'll be back\" ... today we came back :\/  this is another lesson in why you should always trust your first instinct bc intuition is almost always right! i had the salmon and tuna poke (.3 cup of each) and a cup of rice, husband had the bento box w\/spam, beef and chicken.  the poke was ok, the beef tasted boiled and was just meh... not worth it...
