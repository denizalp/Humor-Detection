Great hotel!  Modern and somewhat reasonably priced, if that can be used for nice Las Vegas hotels; ) wish the resort fees were less though....they just recently opened Momofoku on 2nd or 3rd floor. \nHowever, I WARN you, do NOT GET coffee at the first floor cafe!  They serve Illy which should be a good coffee, but the quality was worse than a cheap brew you'd get at the motel!  I seriously threw it away, after paying $4 for a regular coffee!!!! Should have just walked to Starbucks which is right by the entrance. Club access is pretty easy these days, as long as you chat with some promoters in the lobby \/ by the club entrance.
