Had this place on my To Do List for some time now.....finally decided to pop in for lunch.  I ordered a \"well done\" Small Veggie w\/Butter Cheese Crust (Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Onions, Olives, Green Peppers, $9.99).\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sNQ5ZaDneM31V6Qe_19d9g?select=XoGDsNgUlrK9Wb3P_pur2A\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sNQ5ZaDneM31V6Qe_19d9g?select=kqpEk-9H_AngZpHMgGE8ew\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sNQ5ZaDneM31V6Qe_19d9g?select=87Jca8jZku3Jb5TGzwo1jg\n\nI was curious what the Butter Cheese Crust was all about.....after I got the Pizza I realized that they brush Butter and sprinkle Parmesan Cheese on the edge of the Crust....ok, got it.  The Pizza was OK, not great.  I don't know, it didn't leave me wanting more....I know a Pizza is good when I can finish off a Small Pizza and feel like I can eat another....but this one didn't leave me with that feeling.\n\nHere's a tip....if you decide you want to dine in the restaurant, like I did, they only have 2 Liter Bottles of Soda, so if you're not in the mood to fill your bladder, bring your own drink.  Also, bring your own napkins too.....I couldn't find any in the eating area.....weirdness.\n\nReturn Factor - 40%
