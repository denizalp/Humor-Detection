This is the Motel 6 on the southern part of Las Vegas.  Oh yeah very near were the shootings took place at that concert.  What a sh**thole.  Prostitutes, pimps, drug deals right outside the room.  As for the room, oh my, hire a housekeeper!  The room is filthy, filthy.  The sheets smell like someone elses drool...eeeek.  Most disgusting and sickening room I have ever been in.  Bugs and more bugs and dirty icky room.  I wouldn\"t sleep on that bed if they paid me!  Fortunately,  not in the room much.  Left as soon as returned to the room.  What a pit.  Degenerates lurking around the cars.   At first arrival was approached by a drug dealer asking if we wanted to purchase their wares.  Went to Cocos restaurant next door, as soon as I went in to order food, a prostitute who just watched me get out of the car approached my vehicle to offer her wares.  \nThere's a rent a cop who rides around on a segway, reminded me of the movie Mall cop, however this guy has personality NONE and the professional skills of a rock.\nThen walked over to Hooters, which is a dive as well, came back and some 51\/50 African American (is that politically correct?) woman, who obviously is bucking for a check, is following behind yelling HELLO, HELLO.  Do you want a date?\nSo in summary, unless you are looking for a date that has bugs flying off of it, or you need to buy some drugs, or you just don't have enough cockroaches to play with, stay away.  Run fast away from this dive!  I am outta here.
