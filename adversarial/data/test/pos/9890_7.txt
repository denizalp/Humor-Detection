This is one of my favorite nurseries and the people that work here are extremely friendly and most helpful. Been coming here for over a decade and it is very close to my house. We could almost walk here but then who gets to carry the stuff back home. LOL!\n\nUsually come here for vegetable, herbs and spicy pepper plants and they have a nice selection. If they are out of something it will typically be coming on the next delivery truck. They also have a large variety of other types of plants, shrubs, cactus and fruit trees.\n\nThis week we picked out two different types of Basil, some Thyme, Dill, Oregano and several spicy Pepper plants. Jalapenos, Serranos, Poblanos, Caribbean Reds, Ghost, and a bunch of hybrid versions. Some of them are already budding and I'm excited see them smiling at me.\n\nThe people who work here are always ready to answer my questions. Even my stupid questions are promptly answered and they always have a variety of solutions for my dilemmas. Nice!\n\nThere are a few employees that have been working here forever. One of them is the Great Wizard Jimmy. He is like a walking encyclopedia of knowledge and could possibly be NASA material. He is so happy and smart and you will normally find a group of customers following him around for his Guru like wisdom.\n\nThe prices here are a little higher than the big box stores but they are very reasonable considering you are getting a better bang for the buck.\n\nJust need to come up with some new fresh salsa and stir fry recipes to enjoy my tasty yummies. There is nothing like the heat of some fresh peppers right out of the garden.\n\nAlso wondering if those stupid ground squirrels in my backyard can take the heat this year. They sure liked my tomatoes last year. Hoping these peppers are too spicy for their little squirrel mouths and rear ends. INFERNO TIME!\n\n4.75 STARS
