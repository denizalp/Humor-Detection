So first things first. As a person who goes out to eat at vietnamese restaurants fairly often, Wonderpho's pho is decent and it's more westernized than most authentic pho eateries (take this statement how you like it). That being said, the service at this establishment is god awful. \n\nI WAS a regular customer and I loved their BOGO deal (buy one get one free). The last time I went, the waitress took our order which was 2 large size pho with 2 regular sized ones and we SPECIFICALLY said please separate our bills so that the larges would be together and the regulars be the same; keep in mind my friends and I do this all the time. This was agreed upon and we got our food afterwards.\n\nAfter we finished eating, we proceeded to pay for our food and the man at the cash register (guessing it was the manager\/owner) put our bills saying we bought 2 larges so the regulars became free. We tried explaining that we've split the bills as a large and a regular (2 ways) multiple times and there was no problem with it. He insisted that it was the \"policy\" to have the bills that way and he asked us to show him evidence that we've previously got the bills as we asked for. Keep in mind, I never keep my receipts from restaurants and the request was just absurd. Both sides got heated and he called security because we wouldn't pay the bill the way it was. \n\nThe security came and did nothing about the situation because he found that it was too idiotic.  Like why would you call security over something this irrelevant? The owner obviously tried to use the scare tactic to make us pay the bill his way. When he saw we still weren't budging, he threatened to call the police and did so. After he explained the situation to the representative on the phone, he passed the phone to me and we explained our side of the story. The woman on the phone was just stunned at how stubborn he was over $1 and how stupid it was to potentially have 4 policemen patrol into a restaurant for something like that. \n\nSo when security and 911 didn't solve anything, he FINALLY suggested to make our bills the way we wanted (and the right way) so that we would pay. We agreed and let me tell you readers, I am NEVER going to Wonderpho ever again.\n\nThe owner ended up with less money than he would've (we obviously didn't tip) and even lost the respect from the security, the police as well as us.\n\nBefore I was wondering why this restaurant didn't attract much customers at all, well, now I know.\n\nScrew Wonderpho.
