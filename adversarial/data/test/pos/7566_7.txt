Today's wait was about 25 minutes because we didn't reserve online. However if you're in the same boat they have benches outside, couch and chairs inside and some water and coffee to start while waiting. \n\nThe Elevated Egg Sandwich: smashed in avocado, melted gruyere cheese, Egg over hard (but was supposed to be over easy but I preferred over hard) a couple pieces of bacon, mayo, arugula salad all in between the brioche bread. I was expecting the brioche bread to be soft and fluffy but this one was not-  however still edible. This usually comes with seasoned potatoes but I requested fruit instead which came with a melody of pineapples pieces, honey dew dices, grapes, strawberry cuts and two blackberries. Fruit was a bit on the unfresh side for my taste. \n\nSoCal Burrito (special of the season): vegetarian fed chicken, oozing mozzarella cheese, black beans, \navocado, pico requested on the side and a side of fruit but requested seasoned potatoes. We basically switched out sides! \n\nMorning Glow: fresh oranges, beet, turmeric, agave honey and organic ginger\n\nToday's brunch was pretty good  and the service by our server was superb. Owner\/manager and hostess did a duo teamwork job in getting everyone seated for a busy time. Nicely done. Until next time.....\n\nOh btw- my go to dish is usually the pesto chicken quinoa power bowl. My fave.
