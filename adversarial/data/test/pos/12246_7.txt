This ramen shop isn't bad.  But the portions are a bit small for the price.  We had the bacon fried rice, tonkotsu ramen and tori karaage.  The price for the fried rice was reasonable for $7.00 and the flavour was quite nice with a bit of a spicy kick to it, but they didn't give you much on the plate.  Same with the ramen, they served it in a big enough bowl, but the bowl was only half full and the two slices of thin chashu that were in the bowl were I would say 90% fat.  And not the type that melts in your mouth either. The ramen portion was also very small and you have to pay extra $2 for extra ramen. The flavour of the broth was quite good though but don't think I would be coming back for awhile, since the portions are so small.  \n \nThe tori karaage was a big disappointment for $6.50 I got three drumsticks and one wing and they were just average size.  The dipping sauce was okay, but the karaage itself was lacking in flavour.  Whatever it was marinated in made the texture of the chicken mushy like.  I didn't like it at all.  And it was deep fried too long.  I won't be ordering this dish again. \n \nAll in all, the flavour of the tonkotsu broth and the bacon fried rice was good, but they need to put a little more on the plate to attract a big eater like me.
