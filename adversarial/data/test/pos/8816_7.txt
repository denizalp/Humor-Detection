Last year we dined here for my grandpa's birthday and we loved it so much we decided to come back this year. This time we had my grandpa's nieces from Argentina in town to visit so as a happy reunited family we were pretty loud and the last to leave but our server Jim was patient, polite and there for us from Start to Finish! I personally had the Caprese salad, Chicken Picatta and Cheesecake. All meals were soooo delicious I was very satisfied with my selections. We mentioned it was my grandpas birthday and the manager came over with a birthday hat and cannoli! All staff members helped us take photos with our phones throughout the night. It's definitely a great restaurant to be with your family. My grandma and I hope to come back with our dogs and try their pet patio experience ;) thanks again Jim for your excellent service hopefully we get you again next year!!
