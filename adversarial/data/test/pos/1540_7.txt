3-stars.  Average.  Middle of the road.  The taint.\n\nSomeone help me understand how there can be so many people - legendary Las Vegas-based Yelpers that I have much respect for - that live in a town that has BLT Burger, StripBurger, Bradley Ogden, Daniel Boulud, Stack... and yet still stamp the holy, golden '5-star' on Burger Bar.  When it comes to burgers, unless it's a $1000 burger served in some back alley by a gorilla, I personally don't really care about the price, venue, wait, or even the service.  If you're gonna give this joint 5-stars, I think you need to be prepared to tell me that this is gonna be the BEST...[grrr]... BURGER... [arrrrgh!]...EVVVVERRRR!! [HULKSMASH]!!!!!   (Oh, and compare it to a known quantity, please.)\n\n1) THE TEST\nI strolled into Burger Bar the other day (after waving to & observing the flirtatious \"Minus 5 girls\" for a minute - big ups to 'Leo C' for the mention in his review) & bought two burgers:   This \"Rossini Burger\" & this other Angus Beef Burger with grilled onions, avocado, and swiss.  That's right.  Eff it.  I'm on vacation, b-tches.\n\n2) THE TASTE\nI hunkered down and tried each of these things, disregarding size or accompaniments.\n-- Rossini:  It was pretty GOOD... but it just wasn't OMGWTFGREAT. The beef was quite tasty and rich but the one thing I expected more of was the robust truffle flavor that I thought would be there and that didn't really come through... I question why they even add it.  And the Foie Gras thing was weird - I suppose I expected something a little more... \"fois gras-like\" and what I got... wasn't.  Did they make my burger, right?  I mean it still tasted good but the texture wasn't what I'd expected. \n-- Angus:  Again, not BAD... but just not that GOOD.  The beef wasn't nearly as juicy as the Rossini nor was it as flavorful which is to be expected I guess but to put this into perspective, I think a slightly better burger is purchasable through the Venetian's Room Service.  That's all I'll have to say about that.\n\n3) THE COMPARATIVES\nThink of this as, \"Two burgers go in; one burger comes out\".  I'm going to dump the Angus burger since I didn't think it was outstanding & nuanced enough to 'compete' and strictly compare the Rossini against some other burgers I've had from memory.  With the exception of Bradley Ogden, you may assume that I expressly order their best beef with avocado and some onions.\n\n-- BRADLEY OGDEN beats Burger Bar\n-- BLT BURGER beats Burger Bar (this was close)\n-- BURGER BAR beats Stack (this was even closer)\n-- BURGER BAR beats StripBurger\n\nCONCLUSION\nI don't think Burger Bar produces the finest burger in Las Vegas.  It's more like something somewhere in the middle... which of course is fine.  I boxed the Rossini Burger, because... well, I'm not gonna leave behind a frickin' $60+tax+tip burger on a plate for them to dump.  But it's sitting here in my hotel room after having made the taxi ride home and sadly I don't think I'm going to finish it.  Nor do I think I'll go back for another when Red Square's got such tasty casual tapas dishes on the other side of the hotel.  \n\n3-stars.\n\n-------------\nFUTURE PATRONS OF MINUS 5:\nI think that it's important that I verify for all gentlemen approaching Minus 5 for beverages, that based on my interaction & careful observation of the youthful Minus 5 marketing staff, that the area in & around the Ice Lounge is definitely \"chilly\".
