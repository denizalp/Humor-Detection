A review long, long overdue, but clearly they are not hurting for good reviews.  Fuego had been on my list for a long time, and fellow Yelp pal Christina P generously shared her Groupon with me.  Now while there has seemingly been a lot of complaints lately about restaurants treating their Groupon customers poorly, we experienced no such negativity.\n\nI went with the seafood chile relleno...\"scallop,shrimp, and Mahi Mahi stuffed in a jumbo Pasilla pepper with a panko crust and a lobster chile cream sauce.\"  I will let the description speak for itself other than adding, \"yes, it was that damn good.\"  As was the green chili cornbread and jalape√±o creamed corn.\n\nThe restaurant is small, but they have a very lovely patio.  Someday in the distant future, it will be usable again.  Until then, I imagine a reservation would be a necessity and deservingly so.
