Dearly beloveds,\nWe are gathered here today to get through this thing called...... Robin's Review. \nOk so boom! Hard Rock Hotel. Booked a spur of the moment over the night trip and decided to stay here. This is definitely the place if you're big on different genres of music. Although, the majority is rock, you'll still find value in your stay here. I really enjoyed my experience here. \nOutside-in. Can't miss the place. There's a jumbo sized, lit up guitar on the entrance. The facility is a well kept property. There's several free parking structures located on each wing of the building. You have the option to self park or use valet. \nRegistration was quick and easy. Thank you to Juan at the front desk for being so patient! Great customer service skills there. Received the room key, which is needed to use the elevator. Room came with free WiFi which is a plus. Signal and speed were strong and fast. I was impressed by the decor throughout. Love that the eclectic theme was kept all throughout the building. \nMy room was beautiful. I was on the Paradise wing. My view outside was of the Strip. Very clean room. No weird odors (lol.. you know it is Vegas). It was like something out of a magazine! Beautiful, glass shower. A\/C and heating worked perfectly. TV in room that went unused. \nAfter settling into my room, I went to walk throughout the casino floor. Didn't participate in any gambling, just wanted to have a drink or two and peruse all the memorabilia. How cool to stay in a place with a great atmosphere, with drinks, while being in a museum. There's really something for everyone here. Also nightly shows. MAGIC MIKE ! Nice pools outdoors. There's a lovely NY style pizza place in the main lobby. Go there!
