Was here recently to meet up with some friends.  The weather was great, so we ate on the patio.  The heat lamps and fire pits were on, so the slight chill didn't bother us too much.\n\nWe had the Chicken Quesadilla and Duck Quesadilla....both were simply amazing!  Of course, we ate too much Chips and Salsa (complimentary).....but who doesn't?  We topped it off with several rounds of Pacifico.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience.....the service was awesome.  I highly recommend the patio area during the warmer months.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
