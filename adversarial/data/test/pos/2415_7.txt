All right.  It's come-to-Jesus time.  It's hard to watch a thriving business implode, but that's what is happening here.  I've been a regular at this Teakwoods for about 7 years now.  My husband and I liked the atmosphere, food and friendliness so much that it's safe to say we even considered this when we bought our house (within walking distance) back in 2007.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and hard-working, from the bartenders to the servers to the bussers.  The wings (and other dishes) were great (especially as sports-bar food goes), beer selection was good, prices were reasonable.  We've seen staff (and management) come and go, but we've remained loyal, and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees, who have become like family to us.\n\nBut things have been steadily going downhill, and now I think they've nearly reached rock bottom.  \n\nIt started with cosmetic stuff.  Leaky ceilings, scruffy empty shelves behind the bar for a long time, mismatched and shabby (and some downright uncomfortable) furnishings, tatty bathrooms.\n\nThen, the food.  We used to look forward to the daily specials; now it seems management is finding ways to \"repurpose\" leftovers or overstocks in new and unappealing ways and, frankly, in weird combinations.  Sliced hot dogs on a lavosh? Really?  Even one of my previously favorite appetizers, the caprese (oh--now spelled \"caprice\" on the menu) tastes bland and worn out.  I used to LOVE the creamy, cheesy, meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu, but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery, virtually tasteless, and sorely lacking in the meat department.\n\nPrices were raised (during the recent Arizona Beer Week; talk about opportunistic!), and a rash of regulars left in protest, and have stayed away.  But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained, largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there, along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers.  The service in general had also gone down over time, but management seems to want to drive it right into the dirt, as they decided this week to get rid of two of their best servers.  That was the last straw for pretty much all of the regulars who had remained.\n\nI feel like I'm going through a divorce.  It's sad and depressing to watch, slowly but surely, a decent business and a fun place run into the ground (going much the same direction, apparently, as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone) by bad management and poor decisions, who put \"profits\" over people.\n\nWhy did I even give this place TWO stars? For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings, which are still great.  But if you MUST have them, I'd advise you to get them to go!
