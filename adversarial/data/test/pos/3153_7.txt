Double Barrel robbed me of my money, time, and life experience. \n\nWe paid Double Barrel a huge sum of money and we had a group of 100+ people. They brought 3 plates of small sliders and they ran out of food faster than Usain Bolt runs the 200 Meter Dash. \n\nI was expecting Double Barrel provide me with food so I could get to see Tiesto in time. I almost missed Tiesto because I had to run to McDonalds and nourish myself and the girl I brought. She later vomited because shitty food and vodka do not mix. \n\nThank you Double Barrel. Thank you so much for everything.
