It's an okay place for a morning nap.  I wish the \"quiet\" room was a bit quieter though.  The day I was there, wireless access was down, so I could not get any real work done.  The movie was some tear-jerker with Ben Affleck.  The place is clean and comfortable. \n\nThe staff from the security cops at the front-door to the Jury people were all top-notch.  Efficient, polite, informative, they let you know what is expected without being ugly about it.\n\nI'd go back.  But not until I'm called again.
