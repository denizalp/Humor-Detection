As I walk in to the spa area, I can't help but be overwhelmed with excitement. Took the day after Mother's Day off to relax as I had just had a huge party for my sons first birthday and my husband had given me a spa day for a gift. Days off to myself are few and far between nowadays. I checked in with the front desk and was advised to walk down the stairs to check in with the spa attendant. Go downstairs and end up sitting around super annoyed that I am wasting my day for 15 minutes.  \n\nThe gym is small but has really everything you need to get a good workout. There was only 3 other people in there at the time and I got a nice workout. They had a fridge with cold water and towels which was nice and a bathroom located off the gym. The gym has a great view of a private pool area and is very relaxing. \n\nI head back to the locker and got all undressed in my bathing suit and realize they never gave me spa shoes. I guess they don't provide them and you have to ask for them. Every other spa I had been too they provide them to you in your locker with your robe. So, had to go find someone to get me some shoes. Annoying. \n\nI finally go and check the place out. It is great. The actually spa area is really tranquil. The lavender steam room was small but amazing and the sauna was really nice. Like that they had spa music in the sauna to listen too. I hung out for about 1.5 hours going in between each area and then set off to find a clock to see if it was time for my massage. I could not find a clock anywhere. I finally asked and located one in the locker room. It is the only clock in the place. I can understand people don't always want to check the time, but it would be nice if they added one to the waiting area for the services. I got locked out of my locker and had to find someone again. I was thinking these people must be annoyed with me by this point. I ended up getting locked out of my locker 2 other times for a total of 3x during my visit. The attendant advised they do not use keys anymore and had to use combination locks because people kept taking the keys and it was costing them a lot of money to redo the locks. As I was waiting in the waiting area, they had pretzels to snack on, tea and granola. I asked the attendant why they had granola plain and she said people like to eat it.. hmm ok. She did offer me some juice that they had stashed away in a fridge. I guess it is an option for people, you just have to ask. \n\nThe Nirvana Stress Relief massage was really great. Nice pressure and love me some aroma therapy. Walked out feeling great. It was so great, I really didn't want to leave. I hung out for another hour in the spa area and went by the private pool area to get some lunch. I waited 30 min for a server and no one. Had to walk all the way inside to let someone know there was no service. Finally got a server and ordered a drink, watermelon salad and Shrimp Ceviche. The food was great. As I was checking out a lady that was hanging out across from me had at some point went inside and had walked two attendants outside and started yelling about how she just spent $500 on massages and could not even get a server to get her a drink. It was bad Service all around. I finally went inside, took a long shower and got dressed to leave.  \n**At checkout.. I go to the front to pay for my $165 massage and was advised that someone had already paid my bill. I told the clerk that it could not be correct. I gave her my name again and my service. She said that someone came in and paid my bill with a gift card. I asked for a receipt and sure enough there was a gift card applied to my bill. She said, Happy Mothers Day. Someone must really love you. Holy moly.. I could not believe it. Was it some weird stalker on Yelp that saw my check in? Was it my husband? Was it a random person that just wanted to spread love? Was it just a big mistake? I had figured it was a mistake.  just accepted the fact that someone did a nice thing and walked out on cloud 9.The next day around 5pm as I am driving home from work I get a call from a clerk telling me they had indeed made a mistake and that someone had a similar name to mine. Ok I call crap that someone with a similar name got the same service.. right? So, she said as a courtesy they were giving me a 20% discount and charging my card on file. At first, I was just like.. Okay.. whatever. Then, as I got home and settled I decided I needed to speak to someone about this. This was not my mistake, it was theirs and now I was being charged on my credit card when I had a gift card. I called back a million x and finally got the hotel director and they ended up working a deal out with me. They really need to work on their service here. So much for my stress relief day.
