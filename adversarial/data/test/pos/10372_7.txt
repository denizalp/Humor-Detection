I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with Opus.  The bartender, Damion, was very attentive, friendly, and prompt.  The food was awesome and seemed to be prepared very promptly.  The only complaint I have is that the owner interacted with everyone in the restaurant but me and my two friends.  I had been sitting at the bar alone for at least 45 minutes before my friends arrived and noticed how the owner was speaking to everyone else.  I know I was there for at least 2 hours & the owner still never acknowledged me or my friends.  I'm a big fan of customer service & feel that managers\/owners should always interact with their patrons to assure that they are enjoying themselves.  \n\nAll in all, I would visit Opus again however I would suggest that the customer service skills for everyone, including the owner, be refreshed.
