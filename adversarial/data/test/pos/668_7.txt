After reading the five star reviews on Del Frisco's and then trying it, I have lost some faith in my fellow yelper's. This is supposed to be a site of reviewers with an edge.. cool people with great taste. A site that stands apart with reviews you can trust.... But I guess I will only be able to trust professional reviewers from now on. And Yelp will just be a barometer but not the final word. Here's my review on Del Frisco's: The wedge was good, not great. My tuna was good. It all goes downhill from here. We ordered my husband's ribeye medium and asked if it was a true medium or more medium well. They said it will have pink all the way through... that it was a true medium. The thing came out with hardly any pink at all. Totally overcooked. Even being medium well, he should have liked it. He ate a few bites and pushed it aside. Flavorless. It must have really been bad because he usually loves ribeye.  And he was hungry. This would never happen at Ruth's Chris. The steak would be gone!  We ordered the Potatoes Au Gratin and they came with bacon, something I had just informed the waitress I don't eat when attempting to order another side.  My husband said it was near raw, anyway.  She whisked them away and brought us onion rings. They looked great!  But... they were undercooked and the batter had zero flavor. It's sad when the Awesome Blossom at Outback (I've had to go when in small towns!) is a hundred times better. Del Frisco's thinks they know meat but they don't. Sides are INCREDIBLY mediocre. So fellow yelpers, were you just so swept away by this \"real fancy\" restaurant that you convinced yourself the meat here was good? Or maybe it's your first time at an \"upscale\" steakhouse? I noticed the 5 star reviews are mainly from out of towners. Hardly any locals who know better. I have lost confidence in some of you but I will continue to write because I want to help others avoid making the same mistake we made. Don't let Del Frisco's happen to you.
