Asadero Torro has catered my work's Christmas party for the last two years, and I've come to equate the celebration of the coming of lil' baby Jesus to a full tummy of tasty Asadero Torro tacos. I think JC would give thumbs-up to these heavenly tacos. The beef is sooooo flavorful, the corn tortillas sooooo yummy, and all the \"extras\" darn right essential for a complete and delectable meal. Even the refried beans and rice are awesome.  And since they are close to where I work, I don't have to wait another year to devote my taste-buds to their delicious food.  Amen!
