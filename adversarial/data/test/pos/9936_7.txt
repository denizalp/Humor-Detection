The boy was right, and decided at just the right moment to have us sit down and rest our weary feet inside the Paris casino. Hey, if I can't get to Paris itself, at least give me some wine and some fountains to stare at and I'll be happy. Throw in some fancy meat and you may get lucky.\n\nThe wait staff was nice and accommodating. My water was constantly refilled,and I had no idea how hungry I was until I nearly ate half the free bread on the table myself. \n\nI ordered the Salad Maison to start, lured in by the goat cheese crouton. It was your average salad, but very fresh and came with a great balsamic dressing. I can never recreate those at home. I also intended on ordering the roast pork and a lovely glass of Beaujolais, but instead, was given roast chicken and a glass of merlot. The merlot i let slide, but when I want my pork, rotisserie chicken does not suffice! Blame it on my cleavage, I know some people get distracted...but how does \"Beaujolais\" sound like \"Merlot\" and hows does Pork Roast, sound like \"chicken\"? \n\nThe waiter was also an original Nor Cal native and very nice, so I wasn't bothered. I got a complimentary refill on my merlot and my pork came shortly thereafter. I passed the time munching on the boy's veggie plate--which I did envy. It was gorgeous, full of fresh, seasonal, comfort veggies and he was a member of the clean plate club. Garlic spinach, mashed cauliflower, roasted potatoes etc... delicious.\n\nWhen my roast arrived, I blushed. I called it the \"Pork Lollypop\" since really, I don't get much fancier than ground turkey or Trader Joe's chicken strips these days on the dole. I was in pork heaven. Nestled gently on a pile of mashed potatoes with succulent roasted carrots wedged on it's sides, this roast was bathed in a savory citrus sauce--like nothing I've ever tasted, and probably won't for a while more. \n\nExcellent service, reasonable Vegas prices for food that does not include french fries or gas bubbles and a great decor. It was dimly lit, sexy and I had a view of the Bellagio fountains from the table, minus the 20 degree wind chill factor. Oo la la!
