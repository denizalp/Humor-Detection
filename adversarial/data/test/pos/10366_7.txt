52 bones and 38 muscles, what once were two whole parts of my body are now falling apart into little pieces and I feel every single one of them after a log day at work standing on my feet. I've used and been loyal consumer of every Dr. Scholl's foot product he ever invented that he would probably be upset if he ever finds out I'm putting my feet on someone else hands. but I came to the point that I have to add two more hands on the care of my always tired feet.\n I went to the good foot spa looking for Joyce, recommended by a yelper friend, but she doesn't work there any longer so I asked for the second best. Kathy did a wonderful job, I can't say she's the best since this is my first foot massage but anything better than this would have probably been illegal. They have a 30 minute special but I opted for the 45 minute service which at the end given the prep and this and that you really get about 35 minutes of actual massage and even though I was there for the foot massage she started from the top of my head all the way down to my arms and legs covering about 99 percent of my body, (missing under the chin if you really have to know) while my feet soaked.\n It was early in the morning when I went there, I think it was just me and one other person in a different room being slapped around or at least that's what I made out from the sounds and the moans that I could hear clearly since there was no mood music. I didn't want my mind to go wild so I put on my I pod and listened to my own music, Maria Callas to be exact, her screaming was way more relaxing than the guy's next door.\nYes, there's a little of that language barrier, but at the end, the massage language is universal, besides I grew up at the barrio and being an expert on sign language came pretty handy for me. I really had a very relaxing experience, my feet felt like new and so did everything else she put her hands on.  I was really surprised how great it feels after after a good foot massage. Highly recommended, I'm sure I'll be back, I can get hooked on this.\n  No more peanut butter on my feet after work......sorry solin. (my dog)
