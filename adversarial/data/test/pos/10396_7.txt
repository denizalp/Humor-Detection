My family and I will NEVER come back here. First of all it was so loud that you couldn't hear the person next to you. Second of all the service was slow and when we paid our bill the waitress brought us the wrong credit card back. We had to ask other workers just to get her back so we could get the card before someone left. \n   The worst was a large group of people who sat in a small room with us. They were piss drunk and screaming while they were having a conversation. They loudly made in fun of the other guests at the restaurant, used curse words like C*nt, F*ggot, F*cker, and other completely inappropriate words. Multiple members of the staff had witnessed this group of people and said nothing. Completely offended, we asked to see a manager, to which none could be found. There was NO manager there on a saturday night. We told, who we think was the chef, about how offended we were by what had happened to which he said it's hard to control people. Well It's your restaurant and instead of asking a group of four people to quite down or leave, they let an entire room of people be ridiculed and bullied. \nNot only will we NEVER go back to the restaurant, but my family and I are telling everyone about our horrible experience. \nI have never been so offended in my life and I lived in NYC.
