I really did not give this bar much of a shot, but here goes my review anyway. A close internet friend of mine swears by the Saturday night karaoke here. So one Saturday night we decide to hit it up. Right away I am put off by the seating. I strongly prefer tall tables to booths for a bar setting, and most of the seating here is booths or low tables. The arrangement of the booths is very cramped and the place was really crowded so right away I was feeling a little claustrophobic. \nI only ordered one drink, rum and pineapple but it tasted INCREDIBLY bad, it was somehow both too strong and too sweet. It tasted like the pinnapple equivalent of grenadine was used. Nearly undrinkable. \nThe karaoke host talked WAY too much in the 15 minute we were there. And 2 of the three songs we heard stopped half way through for no apparent reason. \nThe deciding factor in our leaving (besides the friend we were hoping to meet not being there) was the INTENSELY creepy crowd. Creeps to tolerable strangers ratio was grim, I would say 20:1, and that is being generous, I don't recall seeing any tolerable strangers but I wasn't looking that hard. A very creepy old man maintained a very one sided conversation with my poor companion on the smoking patio and a very drunk girl tipped over stone bench and fell on her ass. All this was our cue to leave. We called a cab and escaped to our regular Saturday night karaoke up Dobson to Priceless Primetime. I guess I probably will give this place another shot, when I am more sure my friend will be there to show me what is to like about this place.
