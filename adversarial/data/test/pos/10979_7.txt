4-stars for their $1 oysters during happy hour. I forget what kind of oysters they were, but they were light and refreshing. As they say, it tasted like the ocean. A little squirt of the lemon and the vinegar-shallot sauce was all that was needed. \n\nI'll cut them some slack for the long wait to get our oysters, since it seems like everyone else was waiting on them too. It was barely 3pm too, when the happy hour starts. They had two people furiously shucking away at the oysters to keep up with demand. I know where I'll be the next time I'm craving oysters around the Strip.
