The Cosmo is one of my favorite casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.\nNo, I've never stayed in the hotel much less even seen one of their rooms.\nWhat I have come to love about this property is the ambiance and the amount of varied food options.  There are actually several quality restaurants located in this one casino, with new ones being added most recently.\n\n-You want buffet action?  WICKED SPOON has that AllYouCanFeast option covered.\n-Italian food?  Both DOCG (get the Braised Short Ribs) and SCARPETTA (get the Spaghetti) will fit the bill.\n-Greek food?  ESTIATORIO MILOS has the Mediterranean fare you seek.  I highly recommend the Milos Special which is a signature dish here with fried zucchini, eggplant tzatziki, and kefalograviera cheese:  opa!\n-A not-so-secret food stand?  SECRET PIZZA is the spot for a slice or two.\n-Burgers and boozy shakes?  HOLSTEIN'S has the beef.\n-An excellent chocolate chip cookie?  EGGSLUT actually has one of my favorites of all time with its Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Really.  Get it warmed up.  They also have eggsellent egg sandwiches.\n-Fried items served in a hiking shoe?  JALEO serves tasty Croquetas de Pollo just this way as well as other Spanish food from Chef José Andrés.  Check out their $25 \"Lunch Like a Spaniard\" option where diners can order 3 different tapas dishes.\n-Chinese and Mexican food can be found in one spot at another José Andrés restaurant, CHINA POBLANO.  The Salt Air Margaritas here are light and refreshing.\n-Dessert?  Just-opened MILK BAR offers their delicious cereal milk soft serve among other items.  I've had the Fruity Cereal Milk ice cream and love the cornflake crunch at the bottom. \n-Asian food is a brand-new option at MOMOFUKU, but I haven't eaten there yet.\n\nWith all of these choices, there's something for everyone here.  I almost forget that it's actually not one giant upscale food court instead of a hotel and casino.  And, for now, parking is still free.  Kudos to the Cosmo for its carnival of culinary spots and for keeping me and my stomach happy :)
