The good: This place has hella toppings! For a minute there, I wasn't sure what I was going to get. It's also a pretty chill space where I could definitely see myself hanging out with friends for a little bit. Reminiscent of tea rooms I've only seen outside of Arizona. \n\nThe bad: Holy tapioca! I love my little black pearls, but you can totally ease up. I don't need them filling up like half my cup! And while I love a good taro, I felt concerned that my drink was not cold enough to be refreshing. How do you make that mistake? \n\nIt's all cool though, this is the newer location so I'll trust their ability to work things out. The southwest valley needs more places like you, Bomboba, so get it together!
