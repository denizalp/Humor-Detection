I'm impressed! Somewhat comparable to Teriyaki madness but so much better! They have kicked up chicken bowls & chicken strips from heaven. My daughter got the Ohana (chicken strips, fries, Hawaiian roll & coleslaw), she devoured it. Huge portions for a reasonable price. Everything was seasoned to perfection and our food was prepared lightning fast. Did I mention the lychee lemonade? Wow, don't even bother with soda here. Try it, you'll love it! Great service too. Very friendly and welcoming. As The Terminator would say: \"I'll Be Back!\" ; )
