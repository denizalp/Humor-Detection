A clean,well - lit place pho you to enjoy something tasty.  \n\nEven though Kung Fu Chef is predominantly a Chinese restaurant, they also serve pho, and do they ever!  \n\nThe Pho Tai (med-rare thin sliced beef) was maybe the best Pho I've had in the valley.  This bowl of fabulous pho was fragrant, flavorful, and fulfilling.  The Vermicelli had just the right texture and the symphony of \"wow that's good,\" flavors had me excited about my next bite.  The cilantro and onion were what stood out most in the soup, and since I love both of those things, I was very satisfied. \n\nThe servers were very friendly and happy to answer all of my American questions, usually beginning with \"what's this?\" \n\nKung Fu Chef is all about good tasting Pho, a diverse selection of Chinese cuisine, great value, and a warm and inviting atmosphere.
