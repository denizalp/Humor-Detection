The name of this restaurant is Sea - The Thai Experience.  However, the cuisine is more than just Thai, it also serves Vietnamese dishes.  The 4 of us came here to try it and we ordered the following:\n\n1) Tom Ka Kai (Coconut Chicken Soup) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=lmAHepVByukDMOrWinBaoA.  This was quite good with lots of white chicken meat, mushroom, and baby corn.\n\n2) Pad See Ew http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=w_wIIAPX2YUkzawuA9tY1A - I personally didn't try it but my guest liked it.  It looked good, so I'd take his word for it.  \n\n3) Pad Kee Mao with Tofu http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=nUvoYj1Zn7M5W8rYXz1viQ.  This dish is also known as Drunken Noodle.  It was quite spicy with good flavor.  However, I didn't care for the tofu that was used.  Instead of fried tofu which has softer texture, it was the firm tofu (aka bean curb) which didn't take up seasoning well, therefore, tasted really blend.  \n\n4) Pad Thai http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=2GRb1HNlVo0kdAxruvpU6A.  A huge disappointment.  Although it looked promising, the sauce was totally off.  It had a funny sour taste to it.  My guess was that the vinegar used was too much.  My fiance who is usually is a big fan could barely eat it.  He ended up ordering Chicken Fried Rice below.\n\n5) Chicken Fried Rice http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=u7O2fDzz4VxtsVhikDg-uQ.  You wouldn't think an Asian restaurant could mess up fried rice, would you?  Ha.  Second disappointment.  It was bland and tasteless, according to my fiance.  I don't think I'd be able to convince him to come back here after having 2 bad dishes.  \n\nThe restaurant is kind of hidden in the back.  The decor is quite nice and staff is very friendly.  I think you can get better Thai food outside of the casino, but if you are too lazy to go out, this is not a bad alternative.  Just don't get the Pad Thai.  =)
