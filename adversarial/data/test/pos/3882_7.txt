Burned up some of my Marriott points to have my Mom stay here while she visited in Charlotte. The location is great, right off the Interstate. Plenty of parking. Very friendly staff.\n\nWhen we were walking up to the room, I spotted some trash on the floor. And a moment later, one of the staff picked it up. No waiting until the cleaners got to it. This guy just... did it. That's great!\n\nThe room was quiet enough, other than a bunch of idiots shouting in the hallway late one evening. Seriously, folks. People are sleeping. Otherwise, all good.
