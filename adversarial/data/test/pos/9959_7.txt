I love that this place is just about 2 min. from home for me. Hello Kitty and I are best friends so because this place sells Sanrio Items galore I am drawn to this place like a moth to a flame burn by the fire....(Janet Jackson song...)\nAnyways, after growing up on Guam I grew up on eating Japanese snacks so many of the snacks sold here bring me back to my childhood. This is the only place that you can find Aloha Maid Apple Iced Tea drinks and Meji Mango chocolate bars-not even the International market carries them....\n***Bring back the SALTED PLUM CANDY and the MANGO POCKEY PLEASE!!!!***\nNow other than the cool sancks and Sanrio stuff they do sell Japanese decor,make-up,various car air fresheners,lots of chopsticks, housewares,car stuff, Anime stuff,lots of sushi erasers,swords, jewelry, Japanese Hair dye, keychains, Japanese style wooden slippers, ect...\nFor all the stuff they sell this is a small amost tiny by store size standards. So isles are thin but shelves are full. Some things are cheap and some things are expensive just like with any store. I have noticed though that snacks have gradually gone up in prices. \n   The owner is a very nice guy who you can easily talk to just like he's your friend. I think it was last year that someone tried to break into this place and broke their front window ruining a Hello Kitty poster-LOSERS,GO FIND A JOB!!!!!!
