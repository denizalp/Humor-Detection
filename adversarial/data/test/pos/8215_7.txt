I've always wantd a Breitling.  It's really nice that a high end boutique was finally established in Vegas, capital of all high end watches.  The funny thing is that the Breitling brand keeps going down my wish list, but stays on it.  It doesn't help that the staff here judge you on the way you are dressed.
