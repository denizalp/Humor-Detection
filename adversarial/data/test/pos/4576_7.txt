***This Courtyard has a lot of the typical Courtyard pluses--complimentary internet, complimentary parking, 24 hr fitness center, decent rooms; however, there are also areas where it does not stack up well to other Courtyard Marriotts (slow internet, smell in the hallways, etc.)***\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is located near The Strip; it sits right next to the Las Vegas Convention Center and the monorail stop.  In many ways, it is very similar to other Courtyard by Marriott locations.  It has complimentary parking, complimentary internet and a 24 hr fitness center.\n\nThe rooms are okay.  While the lobby has been renovated to showcase the new Courtyard by Marriott lobby design (the bistro, the market, the modern seating, etc.), the rooms felt a little dated.  The rooms were still big enough and comfortable enough.\n\nThere were definitely areas where this hotel did not stand up well against other Courtyard Marriotts.  The internet was a little slow.  They do warn you when you log-in and you do have an option of paying an extra charge for fast internet.\n\nAlso, the hallways had a smell to them.  While Courtyard by Marriott is a smoke-free hotel, probably the years when smoking was allowed or simply the proximity to Vegas has resulted in kind of a smoky smell in the hallways.\n\nService was fine.  Prices were not too bad, but you could probably pay a relatively similar amount for a mid-range hotel on The Strip (like Bally's) if you planned ahead.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is probably a step below other Courtyard by Marriott hotels out there.  Also, its location is convenient only if you are spending time a lot of time at the convention center.  If you are planning to spend most of your time on The Strip, it is not that far from the Wynn\/Encore, but it is very far from everything else.  If you are coming to Las Vegas for vacation, you should probably try to look online at some of the lower priced hotels (Bally's, Mirage) before settling for this Courtyard by Marriott.\n\nAs mentioned, this Courtyard by Marriott offers free parking; the parking is outside, but it is gated.
