In search of food and out of the blistering heat of 103 degrees of Las Vegas, we ended up here just because we couldn't walk any farther. My soles were getting blisters.\nThe pitcher of margarita was average, but the steak nachos were awful!. The chips and steak were dry and no flavors were flattering my taste buds. At least the presentation was pretty...haha\n\nThat's what happens when you're desperate and don't read Yelp reviews.
