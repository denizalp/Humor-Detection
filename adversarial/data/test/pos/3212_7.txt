This was our second time going to the Tiki Lounge. The first time we were there it was pretty nice so we decided a few months later to make a return trip. I have noticed when I first entered that the atmosphere had changed. My family and I felt rather uncomfortable as we waited for an extended period of time to be seated. When the host came out he simply pointed at a table and says it look like that one was open and that we could have that one. Kind of like he was telling us to sit in a corner somewhere. We then waited even longer for hostess to take our order except for she never showed up. All of the servers were huddled in the kitchen talking and laughing amongst themselves. We ended up leaving as we did not feel welcome at all here. I welcome the owner to contact me if he has any questions orange X 2 what I have said in this review. This was not even a one star experience it was actually a star experience but I can't put 0 Stars
