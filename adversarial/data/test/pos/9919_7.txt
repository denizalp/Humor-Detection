The WORST customer service I've ever experienced. I went to pick up a thousand dollars worth of supplies and I was sent to will-call. The guy at will-call asked why the people in the show room didn't help me. I said there was a guy who sent me back here. \"WHAT GUY?\" Was his reply. And then he mumbled something under his breath I couldn't hear. 20 minutes later I'm still waiting for him to find all my stuff even tho I was told it was ready to pick up. Then he was trying to send me to the warehouse to pick up what they didn't have and all I asked for was an address. \"If you'd just stop looking at your phone, I'll point you in the right direction.\" If this is how you treat your customers I'll go somewhere else and spend my money. I won't come back here again, that's for sure.
