thanks to 2 free movie passes, we rode up to Studio Movie Grill today to see an afternoon movie. good thing Twilight was showing because we basically had our movie to ourselves!\n\nthe theater we were in was very nice. exceptionally clean. we chose the captain chair seating with the 2 swing away tables. my only negative was that i wish the seats \"rocked\" a little more so i could actively participate  in the movie, as i am a very vocal and dramatic movie go-er (i have no problem yelling out \"oh snap!\" when a greek warrior smashes in the head of his enemy).\n\nwe didn't order food, but the prices seem very reasonable and comparable for a mid-range restaurant. even the popcorn and drink prices are about the same. \n\nyou have a little call button on your table and a server will come, take your order, your bill, etc. about 45 minutes before the movie ends, you get your bill and then pay and leave it at your seat. \n\nthis whole \"dinner and movie\" concept is cool, and i know it's not new, but i'm glad it's catching on. i had a great time, especially since i was with my wife.
