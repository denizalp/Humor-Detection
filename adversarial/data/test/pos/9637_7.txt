Staff was polite and professional.  My friends and I all enjoyed our food quite a bit, and I had a HUGE smoked salmon plate with bagel, red onion, tomatoes, capers, cream cheese for $17.50.  It could have easily fed two people.\n\nMy buddy had the Chilaquiles with fried eggs, tortillas, rojo chicken, ranchero sauce, jack, \ncheddar and cotija cheese, onion, cilantro and crema for $17.95.\n\nWould go back.....wanna give it another shot...but gotta say, on this day, at this time, this food and service was excellent!
