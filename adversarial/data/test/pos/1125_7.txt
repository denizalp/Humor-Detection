Galito's Flame Grilled Chicken is a franchise from South Africa serving flame grilled chicken with Peri Peri Sauce.\n\nI arrived 5 minute before 3 pm so I can still take advantage of their LUNCH SPECIALS, where there are 5 choices for $7.99 each.\n\nThis review is going to be bias... as I think there was some misunderstanding!!! I want to have the 1\/4 chicken with Rice but ended up I was served:\n\nChicken Strips on Rice with Peri Peri Fries and Cole Slaw ($7.99) \n- I don't really like white meat. Yes it is a healthier choice but why I want to eat chicken that were so dry, chewy and tough.. I don't really know.....\n- So dried chicken bland, chewy and dry with no amount of hot Peri Peri sauce that would able to save it!!\n- I don't really like the yogurt sauce on top..\n- I don't really like the fries as they are like frozen fries with Peri Peri powder sprinkled on top\n\nWhy am I gave this place a 2 star??\n\nAs a minimum service restaurant, you placed your order and they delivered it to your table. At least all the food are delivered on real plates and you got to eat using real forks and knives. My waitress\/cashier kept checking on me and ask how my food was and if I need this or need that....\n\nI would definitely give Galito another try... but I really need to get the Leg!! The moist, fatty, juicy legs!!! I cannot stand chewing on cardboard again!!
