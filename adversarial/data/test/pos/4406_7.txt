Two words: The Food!! This place is busy, often with a line out the door, so try to arrive before you're starving. The decor is cute-old-diner chic and the service is matter-of-fact.\n\nI've been here several times, so I've only tried a few things, but the food has always been excellent! For example, the undeniable flavor of the seafood in my seafood eggs Benedict mixed flawlessly with the hollandaise, avocado, perfectly poached egg and Mancini's bread...I even failed when I tried not to eat all of the delicious potatoes (so good!!) - the Best seafood breakfast I've ever had!!
