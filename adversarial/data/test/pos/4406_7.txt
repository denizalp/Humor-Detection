We NEED a good cheap fish place in North Scottsdale, and I thought my prayers had been answered. Unfortunately, when we showed up around 7pm they were closed early with a sign that read \"out of fish\". I wish they had the foresight to stay open with 1\/2 price shrimp or hand out \"please come back coupons\" to entice us first time visitors to return. This place is either very good or just very green to business. You get one more try Seattle's Best!
