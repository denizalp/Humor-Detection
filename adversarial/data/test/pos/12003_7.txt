Are you serious? The worst BBQ I've ever had. I can't even call it BBQ. The pulled pork tasted like pork in a slow cooker that had brine solution dumped all over it. The ribs had the same roasted taste. They both tasted like they were juiced up with brine solution. There was no smoke flavor at all. It tasted like fast food at a cafeteria or McDonald's. Again, didn't taste like BBQ. The sauces were even worse. Not BBQ sauce but closer to a Chinese sweet and sour sauce. I have no idea what is going on at this place and the reviewers as well. How do you screw up BBQ? But the decor and the wall of beer cans, blah blah. You've been warned. I'm totally serious.
