Easy peasy! Filled out the forms on the website and then went down to pay, sign and pick up the paperwork. Because we did the online thing, we were in a much shorter line and got in and out in a jiff. The people there are really friendly and funny. They see it all. We met some great folks while standing in line. Definitely a memorable experience.
