Mom was in town from Maui for one of her famous gambling 'binges', so since she was staying at the lovely Fremont Hotel & Casino in Downtown LV we ended up going to the Paradise Buffet.  Friday night, Seafood 'Fantasy' night!\n\nBut alas, it was all just lackluster.  I'm sorry but I even forgot to take pics of my encounter with this lacking buffet.  I know for many tourists (especially Hawaii folks) just a buffet in general with all-you-can-eat crab legs is an endless wonder.  But when you're an LV local like myself you kinda expect more from your buffet!  Paradise Buffet was just borderline OK for me, not much I could find outstanding.\n\nThe crab legs are decent and plentiful at the buffet, but most of them are cold!  I like my crab legs warm, but there is not really any station setup for them to serve warm crab legs.  I don't think you can hand one of the chefs your plate and ask them to steam them for you either.  Wouldn't that be funny!  All I can say is please don't try this.  Do not interfere with an already disgruntled, busy chef.  That's asking for trouble!\n\nMost of the other offerings at Paradise Buffet were lacking as well.  The baked fish was alright, but after sitting under the heat lamp too long some pieces were tough.  Just FYI, if you go on a Friday night, it is mostly SEAFOOD being offered!  So if you're a meat-only type of person this is not your night.  Although they do serve a nice prime rib with au jus, which probably was the best thing I ate that night.  Medium-rare, extra au jus, and creamy horseradish on the side?  Made for some good eating.  But this is Las Vegas, every casino here has some kind of prime rib...it's practically a staple!  \n\nThe other seafood choices didn't impress me much.  The fried clams were either soggy or overcooked.  The pasta was eh, just pasta.  And the Mexican offerings that night were NO BUENO.  Just flavorless.  Don't get me started on the sushi that is served RIGHT NEXT TO the soft serve ice cream machine!  Talk about fusion!  Unfortunately the sushi was just plain terrible, dry rice & suspect raw fish.  Even the basic Cali Roll was falling apart.\n\nBesides the prime rib, the only other saving grace at this buffet for me was the sandwich station located at the salad bar.  Yes, the sandwich station.  Make your own sandwich with thinly sliced ham, turkey, or roast beef!  Then pick a cheese or 2!  I think only cheddar & mozzarella was offered that night.  A roast beef & turkey sandwich with cheddar and a ton of mayo helped save my sanity.  It wasn't gourmet, but it was familiar. \n\nHardest part about this buffet for me to swallow is that it's like $22 per person, that's with the B Connected players card!  Without the card it's an extra BUCK.  For me the value just wasn't there.  You can go to a local Chinese buffet with all-you-can-eat crab legs and still pay less than you would here.  And you can get Mongolian stir fry included!  And the very same soft serve ice cream machine.\n\nSorry to say Paradise Buffet, not impressed.  You're not bad, but for the price I would have rather have gone to a Station Casino buffet for less.  It might not have the crab legs but I could have done without them.  But don't get me wrong, the tourists love you!\n\n#crabby
