Specialty Luggage misrepresents customer service, does not make good on product warrantees, makes promises they do not keep and charges a premium for luggage that they falsely sell with lifetime warranties. I purchased a piece of luggage worth around $100 for almost $300 because the salesman convinced me that the luggage had a lifetime warranty. \n\nHe looked me in the eye and told me my luggage would be supported or replaced by them at any time.  He's a really good salesman - he smiles, makes you laugh and makes you feel like he's really honest. He'll go on for 10 to 15 minutes on the craftsmanship and quality behind the bags that they sell. \n\nHe'll make promises and guarantees to sell you a piece of luggage but in reality falls apart like any other luggage you purchase elsewhere without their excessive price \"service\" premiums. \n\nWhen I went in with \"lifetime\" warrantee luggage that he sold me that had defective wheels and a defective zipper that began disconnecting from the seams - he looked me in the eye and told me that I had a \"convenient\" memory. He laughed at the idea that he told me there was a lifetime warranty on this luggage. I told him I was insulted that he misrepresented the craftsmanship behind this bag and overcharged me for a product that was not worth the premium he collected - he offered me 10% off another piece of luggage and said he was insulted. \n\nSpecialty luggage is staffed by slimy salesman who lie and misrepresent facts to sell you over priced products that do not justify the premiums they gauge customers for.
