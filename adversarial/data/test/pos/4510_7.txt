Stay away from this company...big scam...they take your money and even if you try to cancel they dont, then try to charge your credit card for an annual billing.\nI really received a call from a high pressure collection agency to pay them for a bill that I never received.  I asked them to produce any paperwork that I signed that showed I owed them money, and they could never produce anything...STAY AWAY...if you don't want a nightmare if a hassle to deal with in the future.
