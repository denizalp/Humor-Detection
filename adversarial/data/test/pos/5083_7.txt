I'm not sure what to think of this place. Not exactly a dive bar and not really a great restaurant. Not sure why they have valet service either - it's not that nice of a place but then again there is limited parking. \n\nIt wasn't busy when I arrived to meet up with my fiancé and a friend. It actually was pretty dead - maybe 2 tables and a few others at the bar. It had that awkward dive bar feeling when I walked in but the interior was nicer than a dirty biker dive bar - not sure if I make any sense. It just doesn't have a welcoming feeling. \n\nI didn't try any cocktails, just a glass of wine. Not sure if they have a cocktail menu to be honest. \n\nFood: we had the sweet & spicy wings. Good but not memorable. The taco flatbread pizza had Doritos on it. I felt like they were trying to create some sort of drunk munchies. Fiancé said he would get it again. \n\nWe saw another couple with an order of nachos that looked amazing. That's probably what we should've went with... maybe next time... if there is a next time.
