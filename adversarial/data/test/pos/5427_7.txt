He stood in the face of a 2.5 star biz, and braved it anyway.\n\nSalsarita's is overpriced and fairly plain, but I'll give them this: it's not bad at all. Two steak tacos, with a side of chips and guac, and a bottomless soda will run you around $14. Ridiculous on the street, where tacos are king, but reasonable in a concourse that's flooded with stupid expensive, mediocre options.\n\nThe steak is sitting is a brine-laden warming tray, so it's hot and moist. Your choice of toppings - including guac! - are mostly veg and salsas of varying heat. Nothing wilty, gritty or wonky; the 'cado dip needed salt and acid. If you go soft shell on the tacos, eat quickly - single torts will disintegrate post-haste. The chips are warm and non-greasy.\n\nI'm not doing backflips over Salsarita's, but I'm not doubled over a Term E stall - so it's a win (enough) for me.
