Nicky is absolutely the best.  She's been doing my nails for almost 5 years and every time I leave happy.  Whether it be acrylics (she does them so perfectly...so thin and natural, i get compliments all the time) or gel manicures (for the rare times i take my falsies off) it's always perfect.  She always has the newest things...matte polish, gel polish, glitter powder, seashell powder, rhinestones, etc etc.   \n\nAlso, Nicky does eyelash extensions.  The first time you get them, they takes about 1.5 hours for her to do the individual eyelash extensions.  They look so real and are nice and thick, because she puts them on in layers...just how your natural eyelashes grow in.  They look amazing, another thing I get complimented on regularly.  Every 4 weeks or so, you go back and she fills in the ones that have fallen out (which is natural as your own eyelashes shed).\n\nSo between the nails, the eyelashes, the pedicures, and the eyebrow waxing...I spend a lot of time here.  Even though my life and my work and everything else gets super busy and hectic, I always make time to come to Rose Nails.  \n\nIn closing, I'd just like to say...Nicky's great at time management, always sees me on time, and ROSE NAILS is always very BUSY!  They do a great job.  I haven't walked into another nail salon in 5 years...because they're that good (okay maybe twice because I was out of town and the eyebrows were out of control...but that's it, just eyebrows).\n\nTip:  It's always good to make an appt.\nTip:  Nicky is the best when it comes to your hands and eyelashes.\nTip:  Pedicures from the guys are the best.  Good pressure, pleasant experience, very nice spa pedicure chairs.
