Blue Adobe Grill, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.  \nI love you every day of the the week, but especially on Thursdays!\n\nI love the way you greet me with a plate of tricolor chips,\nAnd the jar of chipotle salsa to pour into a bowl so I may dip.\n\nI love to hear Ivan sing and strum his guitar away,\nAs I savor every bite of my free caesar salad and creme brulee. (Thursday night special if you order a Blue plate)\n\nI love you as I devour your salmon, rellenos, tacos or tamales,\nBut don't forget those delicious beans, they also make me jolly.\n\nI love that you have great specials everyday of the week,\nOf delicious New Mexican fare does the menu bespeak.\n\nI also love your kids menu and your exceptional staff.\nOne last tip, don't forget to order sangria by the carafe.
