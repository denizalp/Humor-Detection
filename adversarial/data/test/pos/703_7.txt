If I could give 0 stars I would. I received a competition sratch thingy from this place and my numbers matched. I called gave them the receipt number and they told me that I won and I should go to the dealership to claim my cash prize. I actually called them three times to make sure that it was legit. They told me it was 100% legit. Well, I drove there and this sales guy told me- I have a \"chance\" to win a prize and do I want to look at some of the car deals and promotions they got going on.  Then they handed me a $1 scratch card and that's it. I WILL NEVER buy a Nissan after this experience. Who's genius idea was this to lure customers in like that? What a joke.
