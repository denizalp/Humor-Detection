Ok, first of all, some of the reviews (including in the not recommended), are written by staff. This makes me think that some of the others are written by friends. I would bet money on it.\n\nI wanted to take advantage of their first time client special a long time ago, which at this time, is still advertised as a special as soon as you enter their site: $399 for dermal filler for first time clients. When I called to inquire, I was told that for lip filler it's over $500. When I questioned the ad, they told me (rudely, one of the managers), that it is starting at $399 and that the special doesn't apply to lip filler, but that is not what it says, and I mentioned that. Needless to say, I did not go. However, the customer service was brutal. The front desk reception cannot answer any of your questions. Questions that they should know. The way that the manager spoke to me was appalling. Even after I brought it to their attention that they are advertising one price but actually doing something else, they did not apologize, honour the price, nor did they change it. This was a while ago and I can't remember all of the details of what the manager told me, but I was in shock at how rude she was. \n\nI've been getting lip fillers for $350, full syringe for the past year (from an MD), so their special of \"399\" actually being over 500, for a full syringe is ridiculous, and not a special. I do get a good deal, and yes it's hard to find, but them honouring the \"399\" for a first time client should be no big deal. Just a total lack of professionalism from their customer service.
