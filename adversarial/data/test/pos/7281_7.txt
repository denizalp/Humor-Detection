Let's face it, when you're Asian you eat rice and there comes a point when you begin to dread those little grains. Maybe you've even considered the Paleo Diet so you can use it as your scapegoat for ignoring grains. Wait, what do you mean no? Ah, guess it may just be me. Rice Trax is kind of an deep fried savior that came to remind me the glory of rice and its companions. \n\nYou start off with deciding if you want a plate (for the hungry) or a bento (for the REALLY hungry, or two somewhat hungry couple that likes to split). After you get the choice of upgrading to fried rice (do it) and pick your ingredients from their \"fried rice bar\". Wait what? I didn't tell you which bento\/plate to get? Get them all of course! Just kidding my favorite would have to be the Mochiko, wait no the Katsu Curry, wait actually the Garlic Bento. Hmmm! There are no wrong choices! The only problem is that unless you're a professional food eater, you won't have enough space to try everything in one go. No worries though, they have a stamp card! $5 off your next meal after 10 (?) meals.\n\nCan't wait for them to reopen in their new location on Rainbow! When I make the switch to the Paleo Diet you better believe Rice Trax will be on my long list of \"last suppers\".
