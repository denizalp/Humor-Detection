5 stars for THE BEST DEALS EVER on Nordstrom apparel, shoes etc! The prices are so great that there's actually people I know who shop here and resell the items on Ebay. Shopping here is an actual business for people. I got a Kate Spade purse and wallet and a dozen pair of designer shoes all at a great price!\nThe con is that it gets crowded. I would recommend not bringing your child as it gets crazy there and the lines are long. Also, avoid the fitting room if you can because the line is long.
