Yes its a mess, Yes its disorganized, and Yes the help is not very helpful and just down right rude! \n\nBut I'm not going there for there decor or service I'm going there for shoes because trust me service sucks ass! \n\nI LOVE there shoes and they have tons and tons of selections. Tons of heels in any color height or style you can think of, they have boots flats tennis shoes you name it they got it. Ive never gone in this store and not bought at least one pair of shoes. They are decent quality not the best but what do you expect for $9.99-15.99 dollar shoes. I usually stop by here on the weekend if i know I'm going out and want new shoes for the club. This is a place i will continue to be shopping at even though the atmosphere is lousy. \n\nWARNING: DON'T COME TO THIS STORE IF YOU GET OFFENDED EASILY BECAUSE IF YOUR CARRYING A LARGE PURSE THEY WILL MAKE YOU LEAVE IT AT THE COUNTER, ITS RIDICULOUS TO HAVE TO HAVE TO CHECK YOUR PURSE.
