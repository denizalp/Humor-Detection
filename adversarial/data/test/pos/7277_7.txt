Saw a friend bookmarking this place so I sent him a message through Yelp; one day later, I am here at Japanese Curry Zen with my sis and friends. The moment I sat down, I noticed right away how clean the table was. It was so clean and shiny, it glistened under the fluorescent lighting. \n\nThey have a very limited menu consisting of several fried meat\/protein options to go with your rice curry. I got to taste the vegetable curry, chicken and quail curry as well as my dish, the tofu curry. I think my favorite is the vegetable curry since it was the most flavorful out of the three. I also tried the coffee jelly and loved it! All of the items we ordered were very very delicious and well deserved the high ratings from everyone. \n\nCome here if you're in the mood for some comfort food. Don't forget to try the yellow (medium spicy) spice mix on the table. It smelled so darn good I wish I could take the whole bottle home.
