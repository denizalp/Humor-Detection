Waaaaaoooowwww. Please run away from this Wimpys. Run far far awayyyyyy. It is awful. Truly truly awful on all fronts that count in food service.\n\nWe walk in on a weekend afternoon and the place is mildly busy. We stand at the front waiting to be seated and no one approaches us. Not a single server acknowledges us, not even to tell us to take a seat anywhere we want. I'd understand if it was busy or something, but there were many empty tables and the servers were running around as if they were slammed. And there were about 4 servers for a total of about 10 tables TOPS. So I don't understand the shitty ass service we got (or didn't get as we walked in the door).  We stand there in some confusion, trying to figure out how their seating works for around 5 minutes before finally taking a seat at a table in front of us.\n\nThe table was dirty. So they wait until people sit down to wipe down the table in front of you and put down cutlery. Gross.\n\nTook around 15 minutes for a server to come to our table and hurriedly take our order. My boyfriend ordered a bottle of Canadian and was served a pint...by a different server. Service seems disorganized and ridiculous, we heard one server yell at others for some bullshit. Everyone just seems panicked for NO REASON AT ALL. It's brunch on a Sunday you guys, and it's not even full capacity. EVERYONE RELAX and focus on decent service. \n\nOur food was generally awful, My bacon wasn't even real bacon - it was some weird fake bacon closer to the travesty that is \"turkey\" or \"chicken\" bacon. Eggs were rubbery, potatoes were not memorable. The best part of my meal was their rye bread. Which...should say something; that the toast that they likely purchased elsewhere was the best part of my meal is depressing.\n\nThis place is messy. Messy service, messy food and messy servers. You are better off literally anywhere else. Like honestly, go to the Dollarama next door and get a chocolate bar.
