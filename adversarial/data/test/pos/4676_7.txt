I guess I'm not such a big fan of the alcohol\/ice cream combination after all.  I tried the passion fruit\/vodka and a champagne flavor (strawberry?).  While both were okay, I wasn't totally enamored with either the flavor or the texture of the ice cream.  I did like the amaretto flavor at the Yelp event, however.\n\nAlthough we went on a soon-to-be expired Groupon, the gal serving was friendly and helpful.  I might go back to sample other flavors, including the non-alcoholic flavors for comparison.  Definitely worth trying for yourself even though it didn't quite do it for me.
