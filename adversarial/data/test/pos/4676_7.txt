So I wanted to catch up with a bud of mine, as I haven't seen him in a few months.  I got off work early so I figured I could drive a bit to his area of work.  He told me of a dive bar next to his work called Smokey's.  I love me some dive bar, so I said OK.  I got there before he did, and parking was abundant.  They have a caged off outside area which I thought was kinda cool, if not unique. So I go in.\n\nTypical dive bar, but maybe a little more real estate than most.  I pop a squat at the bar and order a miller lite (special $2.00). Two full size pool tables, darts, and the traditional bar games scattered about the place.  Lots of HD TVs and a nice full bar.\n\nNow I didn't eat, so I can't critique them on their food, and its hard to review a couple bottles of miller lite.  They certainly were cold and yummy though.\n\nThe bartenderess was friendly and fast.  She appeared clean and well kept (which is hard to find in a dive bar).\n\nPlus, there is live music there 4 days out of the week. Good times!
