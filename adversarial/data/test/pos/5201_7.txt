Had a coupon burnin' a hole in my pocket for this place and I wanted to give it a go so I stopped in one afternoon before work.  When they say \"11am\"...they mean 11am.  Not a minute sooner.  By the 4 people milling about, outside I would say that's a good sign.  The kid whom took my order had the personality of a turkey baster.  Watched the kid making the subs microwave all the meat that was being used.  Kinda bummed me out for what they charge for these puppies.  Nevertheless, these were some damn good subs!  Im not usually a sub guy.  About as fun as a colonic but these subs are so good, I would eat them DURING a colonic...
