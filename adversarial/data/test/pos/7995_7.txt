I swear, will someone please tell me, what is it about these so-called \"celebrity\" chefs in Las Vegas, who think they can helicopter in once a year, dazzle the gullible rubes in the local press, drop off their over-price under-whelming menus, then leave the diner to the pathetic experience I was subjected to at Tom Colicchio's \"Heritage\" steakhouse at the Mirage last night.  Sure, the waitress deserved every penny of the shiny dime I left her for being such a perky junior-high school student but not much else (\"oh, sorry for the 20 minute wait, I didn't see you\") but the bartender who poured the dregs of a $20 house wine with a \"take it or leave it\" smirk on his face and a chef who lazily thawed out a $60 steak (cold & under-cooked) you'd think would have learned more at their apprentice stint at MacDonalds.  Alas, not.
