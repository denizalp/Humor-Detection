Horrible. As an out-of-towner, very surprised that this place was PACKED. Sat outside, comfy. Then the server scratches HIS BALLS with NO SHAME in front of us. Not just a quick scratch, but a lengthy one so that we can actually notice him doing this IN OUR FACE.\nI don't know why we stayed to eat, probably because someone else brought our food. It was greasy and unflavored. Just horrible. Especially since I went off of the reviews on Yelp to pick this place.\nWould NEVER recommend!!!
