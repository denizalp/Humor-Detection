A solid choice for home delivery. Our food arrived quickly and everything was delicious. \n\nI ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce, and it was very tasty and had a nice variety of vegetables. The vegetarian sushi rolls were also good.  I can also recommend the scallion pancakes. \n\nPortions we're large, for example, our ample serving of edamame was more than 2 could share. \n\nIn summary, good veggie options, large portions, speedy delivery, and delicious food.
