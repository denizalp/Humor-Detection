Archi's is a Las Vegas Thai chain with 3 locations, and I must admit that a recent obsession with Thai Noodle had caused me to forget about how much I do enjoy some curry and noodles at Archi's, particularly at my neighborhood location. \n\nWhen we first moved to town, Archi's was our go to spot for Thai. The food can be great, which I will get to later, but I think what distinguishes Archi's from most restaurants in Las Vegas is their interior. They have done a brilliant job transforming a strip mall space into a warm, clean and welcoming space. There is a coherent sense of design, which puts me at ease for some reason. Maybe it just makes me feel like Archi has a good handle on things. \n\nAnd he does! After being a little Thai adventurous and eating all around town, I can confidently say that when the food is good it is really good. Granted, they do suffer from inconsistency from time to time, and their spice scale baffles me. A 3 can be mind-blowingly hot despite the fact that the scale supposedly goes to 10. Consider yourself warned. \n\nDespite that, when I want curry or Pad Kee Mow or a very respectable eggplant dish, I am happy to visit Archi's. The tofu in their stir-fry and noodle dishes is not the most flavorful, but I was obsessed with their Pad Kee Mow for at least a month. I became a little frustrated when the vegetable selection kept changing. How hard is it to give a girl a solid helping of real vegetables (baby corn does not count) with her noodles? However, on my last visit, I told the waitress \"lots of yummy vegetables please\", and apparently that is the secret phrase to unlock garden delight because I got mega-veggies. Splendid!\n\nThe service has always been no-water-glass-empty amazing when I have visited. Food comes out quickly and hot. Servers are always nice.\n\nI was teetering between a 3 and a 4 for Archi's, but Archi, I am slapping a 4 on your establishment because although the food is a little inconsistent, I really really appreciate the atmosphere, cleanliness and service, and when the curry stars align, the food is definitely fan worthy.
