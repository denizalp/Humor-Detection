Gata Thai \nFirst off, thank you for taking the time to present my food to me in a beautiful well plated manner.  Gata Thai has a great lunch special at about $7.00-$10.00 which included soup, salad, egg roll and your main dish either veggie, pork,chicken or beef. I eat chicken about once only a week and today was my day for that!!! The soup offered by Gata came out full of Veggies. Which was a plus only downside for (Me) the broth contained fish sauce and this killed the entire game for me, for some reason it's taste Over powers everything for me and I mean everything! So with that being said I ordered a Thai tea that came out large and full of flavor, great value and size for Thai tea at Gata, I think it kind of did the job I needed it to with cleaning my palette. The main dish came out wow!!! It came with rice, salad and my yummy egg roll all taste great and my main meal of basil chicken, now this dish was over sauced but full of flavor, I would ask for less sauce on the chicken next time, this dish also came with red and green peppers as well as basil everywhere, I would try this restaurant again! I was a little out of sorts after my soup but I still believe I had a great experience at this restaurant, great food and great prices.
