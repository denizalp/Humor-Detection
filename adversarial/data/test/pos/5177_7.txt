Interesting experience, a first for me in Toronto\n\nLocation: This food hall is located at 111 Richmond Street W, a 5 min walk from the Hudson's Bay and accessible via the PATH. \n\nFood Selection & Variety: When I arrived at 6:00 this evening, the food hall looked fairly empty. I quickly realized that the hall had seating area in the back (up the stairs, towards Reyna). The selection here is plentiful - you've got everything from BBQ, ramen, Thai, Mediterranean, sushi, omakase, seafood, tacos, dessert, coffee....boy my fingers are getting tired from typing out the extensive list. \n\nBF and I opted to eat at Resto Boemo - omg the gnocchi is so sinful that it should be illegal. The mushroom truffle cream half portion was enough to fill me up; it was flavourful, rich and divine. Their gnocchi is 90% ricotta with the remainder being wheat.  Hit me up again *drools* BF isn't normally a fan of gnocchi as he finds it too starchy, but ended up enjoying this. \nHis meal was the classic double burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries.. you can taste the difference when a patty is cooked on a flat top vs a grill as the juices are retained in the meat...oh my. I'm drooling again at 1:30AM. \n\nPrice point: If you're eating here for value, you're doing it wrong. Expect to spend around 15-20 pp without beverages. \n\nReturn (Y\/N): Yes. I'd like to try the duck confit wings from DaiLo and the omakase from Tachi. \nOther things I'd be back for: Bulldog Coffee, Short & Sweet, Hibiscus
