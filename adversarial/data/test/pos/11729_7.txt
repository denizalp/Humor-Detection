Biggest corned beef in Cleveland?  Perhaps.  Best?  Unfortunately not.  My sandwich was lukewarm upon serving, with a large pickle side and a wide accoutrement of dressings and sides.  While certainly the sandwich didn't taste bad, there were no striking characteristic flavors, no exclamations of excitement, no fluorescent light-bulb exploding in my head.  The cheese was mild and flat, not pungent or aromatic in the slightest.  The beef itself, while certainly tender, lacked the fatty and flavorful full mouth experience that are a necessity in these types of sandwiches.  Horseradish and associated dressing were mediocre at best.\n\nThe service I received was excellent, with that being said the dinner is small and rather crowded.  Considering that the price of a corned beef Reuben is $14, and given the average quality of food, I was quite surprised at Slyman's popularity.  I can vouch as well as any other red blooded american male that more meat is better, but in this case quantity does not make the sandwich, as the meat suffers from a quality issue.
