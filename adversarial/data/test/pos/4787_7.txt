i really like the roof. like, a lot. i thought this place was really cool. we got fast service at the bar and the music definitely lead me to showing off my sweet dance moves. the crowd here was really cool and a big mix of really nice people. i love when you find people like that! \n\nthe only thing i didnt like was the smell of barf on the roof. it really grossed me out.
