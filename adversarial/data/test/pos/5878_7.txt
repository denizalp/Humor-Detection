I once gave this place 4 stars. But with two occasions where my friends or I have been disrespected by the security is RIDICULOUS.\n\nFirst time, I was taunted by someone who worked there themselves. But that was easily forgiven. Second time was the last straw, a friend of mine was pulled to the side and told to give up her ID. I butted in and asked why, I'll provide privacy for the security individual but he said, \" She is clearly intoxicated and stumbling.\" Which was a totally bogus reason. I asked the other security guards and had no idea either. The crowd I roll with never ever causes troubles, and usually buys a good amount of drinks providing business. But Marquee, you sure did mess up, and have lost a huge amount of customers. I suggest you review your security team, and stop getting muscle heads who have too much protein in their brains.\n\nMoving forward from my rant, the facilities here are good. It is clean and there are bars EVERYWHERE. There are different \"rooms\" here and it is nice to step into another area and have a different genre of music and a different crowd of people.\n\nLastly what gives marquee such a low rating in my book is their poor poor layout. Seriously? Stairs? I know the ladies will have a hard time after a night of drunken dancing, safely walking down the stairs. Someone is bound to get hurt and probably sue.\n\nI had a great time here at Marquee, but unfortunately, I am always weary when it comes to their security.
