Are you getting sick of my Cozumel reviews?  Too bad!  I eat Cozumel all the time.  I don't care if it's Broadview Heights, Brunswick, or Brookpark.  If I'm hungry and there's a Cozumel nearby, dammit, I'm down!\n\nSo I did some work on my buddy's house out in Brunswick one weekend in exchange for food.  Yes, I will work for food!  I'm not ashamed.  He is Indian, so I was expecting Indian food, but he said I could choose the restaurant.  I asked him if he had ever eaten Cozumel and he said, 'Yes'.  In fact, it's also one of his favorite restaurants.  Game on!\n\nWe get to Cozumel in Brunswick and I ordered something different, as I have been trying to do.  Don't get me started on my fajita spiel.  This time, I tried the Pollo Con Crema, or Chicken with Cream.  It had a spicy kick to it and it was good...but, say it with me, 'it wasn't as good as the fajitas'.  Good job, class!  The sides included refried beans, guacamole, rice, tomatoes and onions, and lettuce: standard Mexican fare.\n\nThis was my second trip to the Brunswick location and it was very quiet.  The only location that is always poppin' with the best service and the most people is in Broadview Heights.
