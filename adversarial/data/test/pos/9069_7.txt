We came here for dinner as our first stop for the Buffet of Buffet $45 deal. I had high hopes for this place based on all the reviews, but I was sadly disappointed. For dinner, I prefer the World Carnival buffet at Rio. It definitely has more selection. Yes it was cool they have cotton candy as a dessert, but by the end of your meal, the last thing you want to stuff in your mouth is a fluff of sugar. I was also excited about the cheese they had, unfortunately most of the cheese was dried out and getting hard. Out of all the things I ate, the best thing there was the crab legs. They weren't too salty or watery like other buffets and I do like how they cut them in half so it's easier to get the meat out. Other than that, there was nothing special about the food. Definitely stop by the Rio buffet instead if you are only going to one dinner buffet.
