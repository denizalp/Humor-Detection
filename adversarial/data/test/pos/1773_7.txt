A friend of mine and I decide to stop in for some take out. It was a Friday night and man was this place jumping. Lots of couples were dancing it up and listening to the Elvis impersonator. Too funny but everyone really seemed to be enjoying themselves and having a good time. George was out and about talking to everyone and his customers seemed to be regulars as everyone really seemed to know everyone in this place. \n\nAnywho, my friend and I had decided that we were going to order what is is called the Annie special in which you get a soup, two appetizers and two entrees. Plus all the entrees come with vegetable fried rice. We had asked if we could pay extra and have the house fried rice instead of the vegetable and we were told emphatically NO SUBSTITUTIONS! I was like ok, we had no problem paying extra, it wasn't that serious. My friend could tell I was pissed due to the look on my face. I was like wow really? Did that just happen? \n\nAnyway, we ordered shrimp with honey glazed walnuts, house fried rice and Kung Pao 3 seas. Let me just say that the food was very good. I mean VERY VERY good. The house fried rice had tons of shrimp, chicken and pork. The shrimp with honey glazed walnuts were divine and the Kung Pao 3 Seas was nice and spicy with tons of scallops, shrimp and fish. So why only three stars? When someone says NO SUBSTITUTIONS the way that this person did, it kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Will I drive all the way back out here again? Maybe but I know now to never, ever, EVER ,EVER ask to switch out one item for another and even offer to pay extra because it will NOT happen.
