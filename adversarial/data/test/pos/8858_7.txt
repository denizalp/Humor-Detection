Really nice ambiance, for studying, chatting, taking a quick sip, anything really. It's the kind of place where people say people say ciao to the baristas when leaving. There are enough seats to accomodate small groups and seats at the counter for solo. The retro decor of white wooden walls filled with old VHS and magazines feels genuine and unpretentious. Music is modern chillout electronica at an appropriately low volume to add depth to the ambiance but not prevent conversations or working.\n\nHidden gem.
