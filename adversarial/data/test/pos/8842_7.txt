I've never had such rude service in my life. We had come to have drinks on the patio, but the owner and server made us feel extremely unwelcome for not ordering food. We even overheard the owner talk about how he dislikes customers who only come for drinks. \n\nIt's a shame. We were gonna come back to try the food but have decided to never step foot there again after the scheisse treatment we got\n\nThey told us they didn't allow JUST drinks on the patio because it was dinner time and we were taking up potential space for customers ordering dinner. BEST PART: The restaurant was empty..
