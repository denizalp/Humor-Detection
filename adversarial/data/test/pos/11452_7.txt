Stopped in here to try it for first time. Prices for a sub shop are a little higher side. Then when I went to pay with debt card my total showed up with the option to add 10% 15% or 20% tip. The only other option was other so I clicked it and it took me to a window I could put in the exact tip I wanted to leave. The cashier said something and I apologized and said I just was not use to having to tip at a sub shop. I clicked the 10% button feeling obligated but then Someone behind casher made a comment \"he did not tip did he\" I was embarrassed and angered at same time. What is it I tipped for? They rang up my order. So does that mean I need to tip anyone at a cash register. Grocery store, auto parts store?? Tipping someone to do job is bs and I will not be back! \n\nTo me is is a company issue for basically forcing you to tip and then a respect issue with what the employee said. Cost me 20 of a regular sub and a child's sub. Same thing at subway would have been less than half that. \nMaybe I am out of date on who I am suppose to tip but they never came to table or did anything other that make a sandwich. I got my own drink.
