I have been wanting to check out this place for a while. The BF and I were in the area and I was able to persuade him. It was a random week day for dinner, but the place was completely packed. We were sat at a very nice table that wasn't too crowded, but I did notice that some of the tables could be a little bit squished. I think I'd be really nervous to come here on a busy night. \n\nThe BF wasn't really sure about this place at first, but in the end he really liked it. I ordered the Shrimp Creole and it was very good. The shrimp were the perfect size and portion. The sauce had a little heat, but was very flavorful. I will definitely be ordering that again. The BF ordered Bronzed Catfish and grits. He said he really liked it, but his favorite item was the deep fried oysters that he ordered a la carte. We also ordered the Bananas Foster and it was scrumptious. The whole meal was a total success in my eyes and I can't wait to go back. \n\nBonus points for the Shrimp Creole and Bananas foster both being Gluten Free.
