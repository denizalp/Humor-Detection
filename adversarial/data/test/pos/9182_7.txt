Table Thai is my go to spot for lunch in Henderson. They offer lunch specials that are good for pick up or dining in. \n\nI always get the Pad Thai lunch special for $7. It also comes with an egg roll and a salad! The portions are big! Especially considering that it is a lunch special. \n\nI recently ordered through Yelp and I was surprised by how fast and easy it was! Everything was ready to be picked up in 10 minutes, despite them being busy when we got to the restaurant. \n\nOther dishes that I've tried include the soft shelled crab panang curry (also offered during lunch if you feel like splurging a little!) And they also offer vegetarian dishes that are so good that you don't even miss the meat. I've tried a crispy tofu dish that was amazing!! \n\nAnd for dessert, you must try their Thai tea crepe cake! It's so light and fluffy and not overly sweet.
