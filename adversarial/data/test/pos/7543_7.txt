Food is not bad - not great.  El Encanto continues the PHX trend of nickel and diming customers for chips and salsa.  Party of 5 gets one basket of chips to share - want another basket of chips with your $100 dinner?  Pay up, they say.  Most meals include  either rice or beans - not both.  Birds in your face?  No extra charge.
