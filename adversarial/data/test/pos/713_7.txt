I absolutely love Capriotti's. I get the Capastrami everytime I come, it's simply delicious. That mountain of meat, cheese, dressing, and slaw. Oh and don't let me forget they have 20 inch subs. Yes that's 20 inches of deliciousness. Now overall I would give all other Capriotti's locations a 5 stars no question about it but I have had nothing but problems with THIS LOCATION the three times I have been here. The problems I have had everytime has been either with delivery or calling in my order for pickup.\n\nFirst experience: I found out they delivered so I ordered a 20 inch Capastrami with some other items for delivery to my apartment via their app at 6pm. The app said it would take about an hour and a half to get there, extremely long. I called the store out of curiosity about 20 minutes after placing my order just to verify everything. I get told they are not currently delivering as no one there owns a car, they deliver only from 12-4pm, and they did not recieve my order period. So why did the app let me order? That's an error on the owners behalf. If I didn't call the food would of never shown up without any notice. Seems like amatuer work to me. So I drive to the store and get my food. I arrive home and there is a delivery guy knocking on my door. Amatuer work at it's finest and terrible communication.\n\nSecond experience: I was at work and decided I would buy lunch for me and my partner as he has never had Capriotti's. I call and order a 20 inch Capastrami once again. The woman on the phone tells me I have to order over $30 for delivery. I don't know anywhere else that requires that much for a minimum. I tell her I didn't order $30 worth of items last week and got delivery to my apartment. She told me they don't deliver to apartments and basically called me a liar with her bitchy attitude. I asked to speak to her manager. A split second later she is back trying to disguise her voice. There is no professionalism with this staff. I hung up to prevent myself from saying some evil shit.\n\nThird experience: I order food for pickup and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. So I drive there expecting my food to be ready just to find out they had not even started my order. I waited 20 more minutes just for the food. What is the point in taking orders if they will not be ready. \n\nIt sucks because this location does make it's sandwiches good which is the only reason it still got 3 stars and the guy who makes the subs is great. The rest of the staff is shit and needs to get trained on their systems. GET ON IT FRANCHISEE OWNER.\n\nI will not be returning to this location.
