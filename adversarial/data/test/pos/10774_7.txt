I have spent over $1.000 at dot, dot, dot and tonight was denied entry because I had flop flops on. This was after we put our names on a waiting list, went home, spent money on an Uber.\nI will not be back and encourage others not to go.\nI have been there before with sandels.\n And admitted with no questions.\nStephen, who is the bartender is great, but treating returning customers like trash is not acceptable and against my policy. \nDot dot dot is a nice place, but worth being humilated. They need to check their arrogant approach to customers. You aren't the capital Grille, get over yourselves and treat customers right or you will be out of business!
