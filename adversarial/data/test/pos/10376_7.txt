Went to Vegas for the weekend to see Dane Cook, we decided to stay at the Monte Carlo because of the price and the location. The price is decent for a nicer hotel in Vegas; it all depends on how much money you want to spend. If you want to go cheap you go with Hooters or Excalibur, if you want to pay a decent amount of money you are looking at Monte Carlo, TI or NYNY. If you wanna go big, you're looking at The Bellagio, or Phoenician. Everyone is different, everyone has different taste and everyone has a different amount of money to spend in Vegas, that is why Vegas is so awesome to go to, so many options for everyone! I really enjoyed staying at this particular hotel this time because of its location. I felt like it was somewhat in the center of everything! Not too far down the strip one way! Also anytime I rode the bus, there was a stop about 10 feet from the front of the Monte Carlo, so when I was tired and didn't want to walk, hopped on the bus and took me straight to my hotel, five seconds later im in the casino of the Monte Carlo. Not only do they have a great casino, the restaurants they have are a nice variety to choose from, along with a nice variety of fast food! Having everything you need in one place is awesome in Vegas because you do tend to get a tad lazy sometimes. The rooms were nice, clean, smell free and the beds were pretty comfy! The lobby is beautiful, their convenient store carries anything you would need and the pool is pretty awesome. They have a lazy river, a wave pool, a normal pool and a hot tub! You name it Monte Carlo has it!\n\nVery happy with the service, the set-up, the d√©cor, the price, the room, casino, food, all of it! When I go back to Vegas this maybe my go-to hotel!
