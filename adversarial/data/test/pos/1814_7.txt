The Linq is a newly developed. outdoor. pedestrian friendly. brownstone looking. fun place to walk and shop kind of place.\n\nAfter you take your ride on the \"ferris wheel\" as my kids call it or a.k.a. the High Roller observation wheel, take a stroll down the walkway where you'll hear music playing while making some foodie and fun shopping stops.\n\nFor me it was great to find Kitsons, Ghiradelli Chocolate Factory and Sprinkles. SoCal tourists will feel right at home.  A few pub style bars, Asian fair, a Mexican restaurant and of course the Flamingo Casino are a few stops you can make.  \n\nWhat I love the most is during the day, it's much more kid friendly than a smoky casino or walking down the strip where you'll see too many 'coupon' peddlers handing out naked girlie cards-I'm sick of that.  I didn't see any of that here so I hope they keep it that way.\n\nThis will be a fun place to bring my out of town guests, don't miss!
