Located inside the Miracle Mile shops, this popcorn is so amazing and addicting. They have just a few flavors but always have seasonal flavors in stock. Very friendly customer service and you can always sample before you buy. This popcorn is extremely flavorful and worth the cost. Once you take a bite you just can't stop... My personal favorite is the cheddar and caramel mix, it's to die for! If you're ever in town you absolutely have to stop by and grab a bag! \n\n2016 Review #69
