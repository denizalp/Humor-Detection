Before the raid this was the spot to get your at wash. Everybody worked really hard, car was always spotless and I never felt uncomfortable.\n\nAfter the raid they hired a bunch of hoodlums. Many look like they just got out of prison and here we go giving them keys to our cars! \n\n\nI am here now waiting for my car. The guy who took my car said \"do you want to make the tires all pretty like you\". Creepy! \n\n\nBring back the old workers or at least hire people that are respectful and professional!
