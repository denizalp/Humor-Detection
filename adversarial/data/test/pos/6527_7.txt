Worst bar ever! Bouncers were rude and mean. They were pushy and just nasty. The cigarette smoke was so bad and the security staff were busy smoking and shoving into people spilling Payton's drinks. And it was not crowded inside. We ordered one beer and couldn't leave fast enough. Don't waste your time, money, and lungs in this horrible overrated bar!!!  Yuck. Took three showers to get the smoke out of my body\/hair. Clothes wreaked.
