Aria's spa is the place, ideally,\nif you want to spa with your boyfriend, freely.\nCoed jacuzzi, get touchy-feely,\nThat's the point of this spa, really.\n\nYep. Aria's the place to go if you want to hit the spa with your opposite-gender friend.\n\nI usually opt for Qua at Caesar's for my Vegas spa needs, and would recommend Qua over Aria if you are going alone or with one or two same-sex friends. But this time I decided to switch it up and try the Aria, because, for once, I was actually in Vegas with a dude-friend who wanted to spa it up with me.\n\nAria, if you do your research, has a couple of relatively unique features, namely a few coed areas (including an outdoor jacuzzi which overlooks one of the Aria pools), as well as an option (if each guest is having at least 2 50-minute services) to pay $40 an hour for a private spa suite.\n\nWe availed ourselves of both. The spa suite was great; photos do not do it justice. I enjoyed the VIP service that comes with that, for a relatively low price on top of the services ($160 for 4 hours, plus tip for your VIP host). \n\nThe spa suite included:\n- a shower\/locker\/get ready room with a small eucalyptus steam sauna\n- an area with tables for services\n- a living room area with television, couches & coffee table, and private fridge with beverages as well as hot tea maker\n- a private jacuzzi \n\nThe bath was cold when we arrived, which was a problem - our host started running the hot water and said it should heat up quickly, but we had to call her back when it became obvious that it was not making a dent. We drained the tub 2\/3 of the way and refilled it while we were having our side-by-side reflexology and massages.\n\nThe massage, for me, was one of the best I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of massages (I've been seeing the same massage therapist for about 3-4 years now). I had been to Disneyland a couple of days prior, and my quads were extremely tight from all the walking. My therapist at Aria honed in on that very quickly; it was impressive. He also did something with his arm across my spine and outward toward my shoulders that nobody has ever done before. Awesome.\n\nOne of the cooler things about the spa suite was also that we were able to order lunch from the hotel's room service menu and have it delivered there. Salads, a hot bath for two, CNN... we were happy campers. \n\nAfter the spa suite, I have to say, the service declined pretty rapidly. Already enrobed, I grabbed my clothes and headed upstairs to the main spa. I had to wait quite a while for someone to come along and assign me a locker - so long, in fact, that I gave up and went to grab some spa water while waiting. While I was doing that, of course, another patron walked up and that's when an attendant decided to show up. So she ends up giving this other patron the whole spa tour while I'm still standing there holding my clothes. Urgh.\n\nMy suggestion would be for the VIP spa hosts to help with the transition into the regular spa, at least as far as getting a locker and taking your things upstairs.\n\nOnce that was all over, though, things improved rapidly again: I enjoyed the peaceful vibrations of the salt room while my companion went back to the Bellagio to retrieve a swimsuit. Upon his return, we probably spent the better part of an hour, maybe 2, enjoying the heck out of the outdoor jacuzzi together. On a Tuesday afternoon, there were only 4 people out there, including us. \n\nIf I go back with a suitable companion, I think I'll definitely be availing myself of all these things again. I'd love to go in winter, when that jacuzzi will be open during sunset and the evening hours. \n\nI'd give the whole thing 5 stars if it weren't for the bad service at the upstairs spa desk. Overall, if you're like me and looking for the best coed spa experience, I'd recommend Aria.
