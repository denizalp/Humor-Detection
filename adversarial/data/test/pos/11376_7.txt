Oh Toronto...after all this hype about a Michelin rated restaurant coming to our home city, I had to check out what the hype was all about.  I checked in on a Saturday a couple weeks after the soft opening and it was not surprisingly, quite busy.  There were people piled out the door in the waiting area.  \n\nThe organization in terms of getting people's names to the list was quite poor. Nobody knew what was going on so you had some keeners who went up to try to get ahead and were told to wait back and then you had some confused jo's who were looking around to see what to do.   Turns out, they take in some names and when more people leave and those names get seats, there's a girl who goes back to take more names.  So you just have to wait until they come to take your name.  So don't bother being that annoying person who pushes everyone out of the way to get ahead in the name list.\n\nThe other interesting thing about this restaurant is that it's shared with a Japanese cafe that sells desserts and lattes.  I'm not sure if they're owned by the same person but it was a bit silly because there were SO many people waiting for ramen, that they couldn't help but wait in the cafe area and then were told that they couldn't just stand or sit around there b\/c it's for customers of the cafe.  I was that \"avocado on toast\" millennial who then proceeded to buy a latte and a green tea brownie and sat there sipping on drink as slow as possible - for an hour, which is how long it took us to wait.  \n\nNow for the food itself!  We ordered the clam broth ramen, the clam soy-sauced based ramen, and the smokey tonkotsu ramen.  Overall, the clam broth ramen was totally a different take than those strong, heavy ramens that you traditionally taste (the bone broth ones).  It was light in flavour and there was definitely a hint of truffle.  I can see why, if one is used to the heavy ramens, why they couldn't appreciate this broth more.  However, I really quite enjoyed it.  The soy-sauced clam broth one was not as good, however, because the soy sauce was too overpowering.  The smokey tonkosu ramen is what a lot of people who complained should have gotten because it was that heavy, BAM, umame ramen that Torontonians are used to.  And I quite enjoyed that one too. We also ordered the obligatory karaage...delicious but quite expensive for the 4 pieces you got. \n\nOverall, this place is worth visiting again!
