How cute is this little chocolate store :) inside the Golden Nugget, it's open until pretty late. \nTried the gourmet white chocolate with nuts Apple candy...mmmm!!\nThey also have ice cream, bonbons, liquor infused chocolates, toffee and pre packaged candies. Small little store but will fix your cravings in big ways.
