Wouldn't think about taking my girl anywhere else.\nScott the owner has been outstanding.  The staff love my girl and have even stayed open late just to accomodate my schedule so they can get to see her!!!\n\nAnd BTW they are no judgemental, and pitbull friendly.\nPuma's nailed have never looked better (perfectly grinded down and rounded (NOT HACKED WITH CLIPPERS).\n\nCan't say enough good things about these guys and gals.\nMediocre staff may come and go (it's a groomer not a doctor's office folks), but the owner cares alot and will always go out of his way for the dog b\/c you can tell he's a huge dog lover and that's what makes the difference!
