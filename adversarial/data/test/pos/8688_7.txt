Go to Wreckroom if: \n1. you are poor\n2. you are drunk, like grunge and grub and want to have a wild time (this is usually my excuse)\n3. you want to meet fun new people\n\nDon't go to Wreckroom if:\n1. you want to pick up girls or guys... \n2. you want to go out \"clubbing\" \n3. you like top 40 \/ hip hop music\n4. you are not drunk\n5. you have OCD \n\nSimple rules, and you won't complain.
