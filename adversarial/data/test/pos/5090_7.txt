I've been coming to Vegas every May for about 5 years now. I'm  usually in a rush to get out of town. But this year I decided to get myself over to Red Rock Canyon. And I am so glad I did. It's a 30\/35 minute drive from the Strip. It takes about an hour to drive the loop, but give yourself 2-3 hours so you can stop, take pictures, go walk around a little. \n\nThe wall of petroglyphs was pretty cool. Not many to look at - but still pretty cool and only a 5 minute walk from the parking lot. \n\nI was fortunate that the weather was in the 70s. So walking around was enjoyable.
