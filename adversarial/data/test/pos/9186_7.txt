Red velvet anything, french macarons, and toasted marshmallow are basically in my personal book for favorite desserts. So when I saw that this place has all 3 in one convenient cup I knew I had to have it. \n\nI got a bowl with passion fruit ice cream with purple rain (blueberry muffin), with a red velvet macaron topped with not one but two toasted marshmallows. The guy who scooped it said he had never stacked two toasted marshmallows before but I saw in his heart that he had potential to be a jenga world champion and he did not disappoint. \n\nBoth the passion fruit and blueberry muffin ice cream were great but the perfect bite to me was a spoonful of the chewy macaron with some gooey marshmallow, and blueberry muffin ice cream, followed by the passion fruit for some contrast. It's amazing!\n\nReally great place with nice people and especially excellent sweets.
