So apparently bond is no longer under the same owner.. Nor do they have the same amazing nail girls! I have gone to this salon multiple times.. And I went a few days ago... Asking for a basic design gel color change nothing super complex! Pretty similar to a French tip.. And the lady said she couldn't do it! Soooo I settled for a glitter hard gel which she also said she wasn't able to do (like are you f-Ing serious..) Along with her getting annoyed at the fact that I was being picky and wanted my nails done nicely! I should have been getting my nails done by someone who could do what I wanted, but instead I paid $50 for a basic AF gel color change not even a gel manicure! In which I was charged for anyways.. As well as my nail tech trying to make it seem like she did me a favor for not charging me for a gel removal.. \nI wouldn't have minded paying $50 for a gel if I was given what I wanted when I walked in and I also wouldn't have minded paying it to the girls I use to get my nails done! I understand bond is a pretty known salon.. But they're known for the girls who use to work there and did awesome designs, I was extremely disappointed
