Axe Monkeys seems like a fun place to review for my 800th review. This place is so unique and so fun. My husband first discovered Axe Monkeys and quickly declared it his new hobby. I was intrigued and joined him last week. Now I'm looking forward to returning for more fun. \n\nThe facility is very clean and uncluttered. The main axe throwing lanes are in a large fenced in area. Within the large fenced area are lanes that are also separated by fencing. There are two targets in each lane. Each lane is set up with a block that contains four or five axes for throwing. \n\nOne of my big concerns with a place where axes are being thrown was safety. I can be a worrier and I felt safe here. The fencing is solid so that axes can't cross lanes. There are lines drawn at the beginning of the lane clearly outlining areas that the axe can't cross. Before we began an instructor went over safety instructions. Employees are roaming the throwing areas to be sure that everyone is following safety protocol. Closed in shoes are a requirement for throwing.  \n\nWhen we arrived we filled out waivers and paid at the counter. We were given the option of one or two hours of throwing time. The employee that helped us recommended two hours for first timers, but I was good with one hour on my first visit. It did take me time to figure out my technique so I can see why two hours would be recommended. Each hour of throw time runs just over $20 per hour. There are axes included, but there are also specialty axes available for an additional charge. First timers can take advantage of a Yelp check-in discount code. I noticed that they were running a Groupon too. \n\nOnce we were ready for throwing an instructor came out to go over safety rules and then we headed to our lane. Each first timer will get a demonstration of a few throwing techniques from the instructor. Instructors are in the throwing area to help if you need them during your hour as well. Every employee we encountered was really friendly and welcoming. \n\nThis is such a unique activity. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!
