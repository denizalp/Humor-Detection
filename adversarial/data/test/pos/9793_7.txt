Jake's can be a really great place to hang out. I say \"can\", because sometimes it just misses the mark. For example, I came here on a Saturday for some dinner outdoors and enjoyed a couple beers with my friends. I had a fantastic time. The week before that, I came here on Friday night to hang around the bar and again, enjoy a few beers with friends. This time, it was not so fantastic. \n\nFirst, let's talk about the good. They've got a wonderful outdoor space that's large and comfortable. They've got a great drink and food selection with some hearty pub favourites like meat pies and burgers. The servers were extremely friendly and even though they were very busy, we didn't have a huge problem getting their attention. \n\nBut what happened the Friday before?? My friends and I got here at around 10 pm. It was pretty empty for a Friday night, but it was also chilly outside so it was understandable. All we wanted was a place to talk, chill, and drink so we took seats by the bar. For some reason, there were kids running up and down the stairs. Not Jake's problem at all, it just got me thinking about how it was past their bedtime. \n\nIt was nice for the first 30 minutes or so. Then suddenly, they decided they needed to pump the place up or something. Not that it was the crowd to do it with; there were maybe 10 people on the ground floor, and probably families up on the second floor since there were kids. The DJ started blasting some clubbing music about 2 feet away from us. So here we were in a nearly empty establishment, unable to hear each other talk, beats blasting into our ears, with kids knocking over popcorn from the popcorn machine. At some point, we even heard one of the waitresses telling the DJ to turn it down. \n\nWas this a bar? Was this a family restaurant? Was this a club? I left very confused with my ears ringing that night.\n\n(47\/100) - 2016
