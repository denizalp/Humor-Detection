My go-to taqueria in Montreal. Authentic Mexican tacos. No old el passo b.s. \nMy gfs and I come to this place on a monthly basis almost. Not much decor or ambiance; it's a chill, unpretentious place. \nThe tacos are simple; 3-4 ingredients at most. Just the way a taco is meant to be. And the sauces are to die for! My mouth just watered...
