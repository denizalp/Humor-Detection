We stopped in this place  for some dessert and boba. My friends ordered the pistachio boba and honey toast, and I ordered a slice of Italian lemon cake.\n\nThe lemon cake was interesting because initially the lemon flavor was very mild. I ate half of it, and then saved the rest for later. The next day, it's lemon flavor was much better. I am not sure whether what I ate earlier interrupted with its flavor, but it was much better the next day.\n\nThe cake was moist and came with a creamy butter cream center which was quite rich. The crumbly crust on top was good and the raspberry drizzle and powdered sugar sweet. The cake portion, which had the lemon flavor was soft.\n\nMy friends rather enjoyed the pistachio bobas and the honey toast, which did not last very long. Service was friendly enough, and they also offer WiFi and make a variety of teas and coffees.
