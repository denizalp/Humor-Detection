I come here only when they send me $25 coupon once in a while.\nThere are always a lot of waiting in line to get free food (Me, too).\nCan't complain about the food because I'm getting it for free but last time when I ordered Cobb salad, they only put 3 tiny pieces of chicken in it and forgot to put bacon. I saw the kitchen was crazy busy so I didn't want to complain. The salad was nice and crisp.\nI'll be back when I get a free coupon again.
