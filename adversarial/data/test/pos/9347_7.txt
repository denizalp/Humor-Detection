Forget about the beer, it's about the food!  Yes, I know they have 26,592 varieties of beer, but you can get all of them somewhere else.  But the food is made right there, right then.\n\nI stopped in on a Thursday night for dinner.  I had been wanting to try HBH for some time.  I picked a night where it was very busy, but I guess it's busy any evening.  The bar was full, nearly every table was full, and the noise level was full volume.\n\nI ordered the Farfalle with Prosciutto and Shrimp for $18 and the Vanilla Sparkling  Orange for a refreshing non-alcoholic bevy.  The pasta dish arrived looking as good as it would taste.  The shrimp were not overcooked, the prosciutto was salty and fresh, and the noodles were incredibly good.  The buttery pesto sauce was laced with parmesan in addition to the large shavings of parmesan on top.  I ate every morsel.\n\nI would have liked to see a few more shrimp in the dish.  Four medium shrimp seems a bit light (yes, I counted the shrimp, you can tell a lot from the protein to carb ratio), for $18 a couple more would be nice.\n\nThis is not the place to go for a quiet dinner, expect lots of noise, and lots of beer.  But that's why you go there, right?
