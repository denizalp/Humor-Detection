After years of getting ripped off and brutalized by Rogers I decided to give up and go with the underdog Wind. Not such a hot idea in many regards, great in others. \n\nPROS\nNo contract.\nCheap unlimited talk and unlimited data plan.\nUnlimited calling across Canada.\nYou get to stick it to Canada's mafia-like telecom monopoly.  \n\nCONS\nHorrible signal coverage. Phone often roams in the middle of Toronto or gets no signal at all. \nInaccurate coverage map. They claim to have coverage all the way up the 404 corridor but if I go north of highway 7 I get nothing. Tried getting a new SIM card and even upgraded my phone and still doesn't work for me on the 404.\nAlthough my plan has unlimited Canada wide calling I am often met with \"Not enough on your account\" when dialling long distance even when fully topped up. Wind has no explanation. \nThey cut off my phone a full week before the bill was even due and only allowed me to receive incoming calls even though my account was not past due. No explanation.\nSevere internet throttling even when well below the high usage threshold where throttling is supposed to kick in. \nIm pretty sure customer service is in India which makes the articulation of your issues with the service rep laborious and frustrating. \n\nCONCLUSION\nYou get what you pay for. Price is nice, signal is garbage. I hate to say it but I am going to have to bite the bullet and go back to a major unless these guys can improve their signal strength in the next few months.\n\nThree stars only because Im happy to not be getting hosed by Rogers anymore otherwise it would be a solid two star rating.
