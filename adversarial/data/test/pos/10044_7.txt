I was awesomely overwhelmed with yummy icecream smells when I walked in. The dessert was great! And the customer service was even better! (Super friendly and informative!) I think maybe some other Yelp reviewers visited the store when it was clearing out some training kinks when they first opened because service was great for us each time. I feel like we should all be supportive and understanding of small businesses (not enough of them)!\n\nAnyway!bI had a scoop of pistachio Thirfty's in a waffle cone! Can never go wrong with Thirty's! I've tried the shaved snow before and it really was shaved...ICE CREAM (if you can imagine that). I like taro with strawberries and mochi :) \n\nMy BF had a vanilla creamy bun with cinnamon crunch! Apparently he thinks that's a nutritious breakfast since it has cereal! I guess it's always a good time for dessert! Yay Yuki!
