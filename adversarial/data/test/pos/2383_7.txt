Location, location, location. \n\nDo you know how frustrating it is when it feels as though every Mexican food place in CenPho is a sit-down restaurant with limited hours? Goodness gracious, this is what I needed. Lowkey, there is a drive through if you make a right (while facing the building) and go around. \n\nI've greatly enjoyed their burritos, but not their other stuff. Works for me anyway, I need this for late nights and early mornings.
