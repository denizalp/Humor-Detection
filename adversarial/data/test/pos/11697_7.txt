Ok. So I saw this show. DONT JUDGE ME! Well, at least until you have seen it for yourself. Like most guys, I was very critical of this show when I first heard about it. My thoughts were, \"I don't want to go see a show just to see guys dress up in drag and prance around the stage.\" \n\nIt just so happens that I took the fam to go see Jeff Civillico at the same venue. Upon our exit, there was a guy giving out vouchers for two to go see Divas that same night. Again I was thinkin, yeah right, cant wait to see men dressed up as women! If it wasn't for my wife, which just happens to be the voice of reason in a lot of cases (which is why I married her), she suggested we go see this as a \"Date Night\" type of thing. So I agreed and later that night, we had dinner and then proceeded to The Quad.\n\nAs we were in line, a dude that looked like Tina Turner was walking up and down the line asking people if they wanted to purchase fans for 2 dollars in which all proceeds go to the Make a Wish Foundation. \n\nOnce we were seated, the star of the show, Frank Marino who was impersonating Joan Rvers,  came out on stage and did his spiel which was very entertaining. Joan herself would be impressed. I find out that Frank and his colleagues have been doing this show for 28 years running. That's very impressive. \n\nThen, Frank introduces the first act which was Madonna. Wow! That's a dude? The lip syncing and dance moves were all on point. Props goes out to the Divas male dancers. To me it looked like they really enjoyed what they did.\n\nAfter that, from my memory in no particular order because there were so many celebrities they impersonated were Dolly Parton, Liza Minelli, Shania Twain, Reba Mcentire, Lady Gaga, Beyonc√©, Britney Spears, Bette Midler, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Cher, Tina Turner, and Celine Dion. In between each introduction, Frank would change outfits and I don't know how he does it so quick because all the outfits he puts on look so complicated. Also if you watch this show again 2 to 3 weeks later, you may have new celebrities you have never seen before.\n\nSo in the end, I was impressed from the overall production. From beginning to end there was never a dull moment. I suggest to you if you havnt seen it yet is to do so soon because they have been doing this for 28 years now and there is no guarantee it will go on forever. Definitely worth seeing at least once. I give these guys props for all the costume changes and make up they gotta go through on a nightly basis.
