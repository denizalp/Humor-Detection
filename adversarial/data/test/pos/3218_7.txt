I like this theater because its just a theater.\n\nNow what I mean by that is that its not hidden away somewhere in some smoke filled casino or tourist packed mall. That alone makes it good in my book!\n\nI also like that I can get discounted tickets for Regal theaters at Costco!\n\nThe one thing I didn't like was once we bought our tickets out in front we were greeted by the ticket taker and while he was taking our tickets he asked if we would like to donate to one of the charities they support, i didnt have any cash on me, and really I didnt even bringmy purse with me because like I said before we pre bought tickets at Costco.\n\nSo we politely told him that we didnt have any cash on us and we started to try and walk by to get to our movie that was about to start. He blocked us from gloing in and said well we accept credit card donations out front, and then he just looked at us like why arent you going to donate. I am all for donating to charities when i have the cash ready and available but this guy was so pushy, condescending,  and borderline rude that even if I had cash or my card on me I probably wouldve passed.
