Hellooooo... it's my new favorite buffet in Vegas... even if I didn't have one before.\n\nEverything was pretty damn good especially since most buffets have mediocre food. $22 for brunch and it includes one free alcoholic beverage... oh hell yes!\n\nEat here, you won't regret it. Every single time I come to Vegas from now on, I'm going here... and Earl's for that matter. :)
