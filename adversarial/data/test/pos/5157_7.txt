Burgers in my mind are supposed to be grilled over a flame, thick and medium rare. Served with a toasted bun, american cheese with let\/tom\/pic\/mayo and mustard. (It's my review)\n\nSB does most of it perfectly. \n\nThe Bun is a yellow egg bun, toasted and topped with all the required toppings. \n\nThe toppings were all fresh and very good, including the cheese. \n\nThe burger, while it is a 1\/2 l\/b about 1\/3 was lapping over the bun. It is a thin, flat fried burger, sort of crispy on one side too. While not my preferred, it was still a good tasting burger. Just not great. \n\nIMHO Five guys is better if fried burgers are your thing. \n\nThe staff was great. The management was great, the place was pretty clean the price was high for what I recieved. $6 burger $1.80 drink.  \n(it was plenty of food though)\n\n3.86 stars
