Eating here was a terrible experience. The food was okay, but the service was a nightmare. We only had 7 people in our party, but they acted like we were an unwieldy large group. They forgot some of our dishes and beverages, even after being reminded several times. The management was rude when we tried to address the problem. Additionally, the plain rice is outrageously expensive and they tricked us into ordering far more than we needed. Save yourself the headache and find somewhere else to eat.
