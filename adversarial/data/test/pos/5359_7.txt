This place is so fun! The inside is super groovy and happy! Makes for a great atmosphere and a really fun trip for a sweet treat. They had more flavors than I knew what to do with! It was honestly kind of overload, but I was not disappointed! \n\nThe donuts are kind of small, (peace, love, and LITTLE donuts), and a little pricey - but honestly a larger donut with the same amount of fun would probably be too much and overwhelming. \n\nThese little donuts pack a whole lot of love, and they're made right in front of your face. I got a half dozen for around $8. You can build your own donut but I picked 6 from the choices they had and I was really happy with everything I got! I recommend the Elvis and the mocha! It was busy when I walked in but the line moved fast. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try 6 more!
