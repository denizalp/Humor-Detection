La Hacienda is one of the many restaurants where, after an initial visit, I praised them. But after returning a second time exactly one year later, I ended up dropping the rating after quickly realizing that things aren't quite as good as we remember.\n\nLa Hacienda is tucked away deep inside the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess resort. If you're just coming here to eat dinner, you'll be forced to use valet parking. Be sure to get your server to validate your ticket.\n\nAs for the restaurant itself, it's very nicely decorated. But as usual, I'm more focused on the food. Chips and salsa are fine. Their guacamole, which has apparently went from 15 dollars to 16 dollars in the last year, isn't quite worth what they're asking. We've had it done better and we've had it done cheaper. I'd suggest passing, or trying one of their more creative guac options beyond the traditional recipe.\n\nFor the first visit, I ordered the Filet a la Parilla, which is grilled beef tenderloin (cooked medium). The filet sits atop two Oaxaca cheese enchiladas and also includes some chile pasilla gastrique. My meat was cooked perfectly and I was quite pleased with the overall quality.  \n\nMy girlfriend has tried the Tampiquena, which includes skirt steak (cooked medium well). This includes a mole cheese enchilada, cactus pico, guacamole, chile poblano, and potato gratin. She's quite picky about her mole, but appeared to like the quality of what they offered here. However, she ordered some carnitas enchiladas on a return visit and discovered that the mole recipe has been altered, which now includes a bit of spice. Carnitas quality, however, was decent.\n\nI've tried their barbacoa tacos, which are fine, but really no different than what you can find at any respectable Mexican joint that knows what they're doing. Cutting a single slice of lime into thirds is embarrassingly stingy, but whatever. The taco meat was good quality, but not worth the 26 dollars they're asking.\n\nAdditional changes we discovered were the absence of the Oaxaca cheese mash, which has apparently been eliminated as a side during the last year despite being a big fan of it during our first visit.\n\nFor dessert, they offer some great-tasting churros. Although unlike most churros we've had, these are incredibly moist, soft, and practically melt in your mouth. Previously, the dish included three separate dipping sauces, contained in edible chocolate cups. As if that isn't clever in and of itself, each cup was a separate type of chocolate (milk, dark etc). Once again, they've also eliminated this, now providing you with a single plate of chocolate sauce, but still charging you as if you're getting the previous highly-stylized version. Pathetic!\n\nSo, after seeing pictures and videos of their flaming coffee, we reluctantly agreed to order one. Neither one of us are big fans of liquor, but we took a risk and ordered the Café Caballo - as it seemed like the least intimidating out of all their concoctions. This included Bailey's, creme de cacao, and frangelico. We assumed the coffee was served cold, but it was actually steaming hot. For the first trip, it was delicious, containing a rather complex flavor that in absolutely no way felt harsh on the booze end (which is what we both feared). Once again, in less than a year, they decided to up its price from 14 dollars to 20 dollars. During our second experiment, the drink tasted more harsh from the booze - while the server also seemed absolutely miserable while making it. Obviously, this does nothing to help his quest for a good tip. Additionally, they seem to have eliminated what was previously a longer list of different flaming coffee options, narrowing them down to just three choices.\n\nOverall, I originally gave this restaurant four stars. However, after returning a second time and discovering that they've eliminated items, arrogantly upped the prices, and exposed their inconsistencies, I don't feel the place is really worth it. I was originally surprised by their 3.5 star average. But now? It all makes sense.\n\nTry them once and be done with it.
