ADORABLE!!! I've been to the Serendipity in New York, this one is definitely a lot flashier and vegas-y. Very pink, very open, lots of colors and loud  music that makes you feel like you're in a club already.\n\nWe called ahead and made a reservation for lunch, which turned out to be a brilliant idea because it was super crowded and the wait was long. We also opted to sit indoors, because despite their fans outside, I was not about to sit in the 105 degree weather.\n\nTheir brunch menu looked pretty amazing.. super tasty breakfast items, and some super tasty lunch items. We decided to mix a little of both and ordered the french toast log and a cheeseburger to share among the 3 of us. When the french toast arrived, we were in awe. It was definitely a LOG, and it was huge! On one end were some breakfast potatoes and 2 sunny side eggs with bacon, and on the other end were some fresh berries with whipped cream. It was definitely a true breakfast meal! The cheeseburger was very good too. Everything was super tasty, but we were really waiting for the frrrrozen hot chocolate at the end! We got a coupon for a free one with our stay at Paris, so that just made it extra delicous. Nothing beats that cool dessert on a hot Vegas day! The bill only came out to $32!!
