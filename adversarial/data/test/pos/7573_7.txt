Hey...what can you really say, round trip from vegas to LA for only $79.  If you're going to die, you're going to die.  I mean...you're more likely to die driving on the 15 fwy 300 miles there and 300 miles back, ya know? Many things can go wrong when you drive long distances, such as flat tires, over heating, transmission issues, boredom, drunk drivers, horny truck drivers trying to stay next to you, etc...
