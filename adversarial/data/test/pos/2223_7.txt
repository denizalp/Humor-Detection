Pumpkin Ice cream? \n\nPeanut Butter? \n\nAre you shitting me? This is ice cream heaven. \n\nHaving worked and travelled in Italy, sampling gelato far too much, I can say without a doubt, this ice cream and their gelatos are my 2nd favourite in the world. That's pretty amazing. \n\nThe pistachio gelato is fantastic, it isn't the radioactive sweet stuff you get at a lot of gelato shops. \n\nMy experience at Ed's is that each flavour is the concentrated, best and pure expression of itself in ice cream form. I only wish there was one in the West end.
