I'll start with, the food is pretty good. Just like the other location, except this is more of a cafeteria style and a bit less divey. \n\nI am not a fan of the setup for multiple reasons. 1. It's confusing. I have no idea where I am ordering, if I am paying first then going to the counter to pick my toppings. I don't know which area I am supposed to order what food from. It is all crazy and unorganized. 2. The staff doesn't really care to help you figure out what you are supposed to be doing. I asked where I should order a breakfast burrito from, and the man behind the counter pointed at a area. However when I went to that spot, that woman said I should pay first, then come back. 3. Once I did order, I didn't get to select what I wanted to do inside the breakfast burrito. I had to shout, as she was rolling it up, \"Can I have some avocado?\". It was just a sloppy mess of a system. Speaking of sloppy mess, there were no to-go lids for the salsa bar, so that was a fun experience in the car, each of us juggling our salsas all the way home. Clearly, we were desperate.\n\nBottom line is, I have no idea what to do here, and if the staff helped you figure out where to order, and what the process was, I think this place would be great. The food is good, sure! But in a city full of wonderful Mexican food it is not worth it to deal with the strife of eating here.
