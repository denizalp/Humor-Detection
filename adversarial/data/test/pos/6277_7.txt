This is a hard review to do, so I think this is best left to bulletpoint format until I get to my final point of contention.\n\nThe Goods:\n* You can get some great clothing items for very good prices.\n* They are currently remodeling the front-end, so hopefully the result will pay off for the Center.\n\nThe Bads:\n* It's on the ass-end of the Strip.  You don't happen to wander upon this unless you are specifically looking for it, or get one of those motels down in that area (And why would you?).\n* Other than the carousel, it's not very kid friendly, as all the stores that could have proven entertaining have closed down in the last year or so.  I'd suggest a babysitter, or pray they like hanging out in the food court.\n* There's a few kitchen places, and one or two specialty stores, but largely, there's not a lot of diversity in the shopping experience.\n\nNow.  For the biggest complaint.  And the reason I HATE coming out to this place.\n\nThe mall kiosk vendors.\n\nLook, I did this sort of job once way back in the day.  Its not glamorous, and it's boring because you are usually stuck selling things no one really thinks about buying.  Or wants.  But I refer to this Outlet Center as \"The Gauntlet\".\n\nKiosk after kiosk of rude, pushy people who chase you down, yell at you from across the way, rub their wares on you whether you ask (or want) them to or not, and my favorite is when they actually stand in your way to block you and force you to stop.  And when you try to sidestep them, they sidestep WITH you to keep you blocked.  \n\nOh, Hell no.\n\nAt this point, you aren't going to get my business, but you are going to get something else from me.  And you're not going to like it.\n\nIt is what it is, and as long as you stick to the sides of the mall, or use some other customer as your sacrificial lamb walking through to \"feed\" the kiosk people, you can find some nice clothing options here.  Anything else, it's not what you could call an \"exciting\" shopping experience.
