Can we have a minute for the spicy chocolate coconut milk ice cream?\nThere are few things on this planet that I like the taste of so much I crave it...and this is one of them.\nThey also have all sorts of insanely delicious \"real\" ice cream flavours. Like SALTED CARAMEL (oh my god), CARDAMOM (I die), EARL GREY (AHHHH), P&S COFFEE (TAKE ME NOW).\n\nHonestly, I've never been there and been like \"meh, ice cream\". \n\nThey are open late, they have ice cream sandwiches and sundaes and the staff is always friendly and willing to give samples.
