$5 for a shampoo, cut and style??? Yep. \nThe prices for services here are amazing. \nMy only complaint is that it took almost one hour to get a simple trim. The student has to have everything approved and sometimes the instructors are not around. \nThe atmosphere is not spa like at all, but when I'm in need of a simple service this is the best bang for my buck.
