I came here for the very first time - to go to Parkway Mall mobilicity for the $25\/month data plan because I always here about this mall on the radio. \n\nAnyways, parking was pretty full here. The first thing I recognize is the beautiful METRO located in the mall (well more off to the side actually). The mall itself is relatively old, with a few bakeries and shops inside such as Home Hardware, Payless, mobile phone booths in the small middle booths in the mall and small stores. One of the stores that caught my eye was a tiny booth inside the mall where ladies were selling their knitted products. I thought it was super adorable, probably cause Christmas is arriving as well.\n\nThe food court has like two places you can eat from and a bubble tea shop. There's also a public library here as well. I think Parkway Mall is located fairly close to a high school because I saw a lot of highschool students in uniforms walking around here during after school hours.\n\nIn the same plaza, there's a McDonalds and an LCBO.
