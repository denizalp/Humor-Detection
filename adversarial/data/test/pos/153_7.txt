Ever wonder how far $56 will go at Pomelo's? I'll tell you. One appetizer, 2 salads (one with salmon) and 1 glass of wine. Yep....$56. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if they put more dressing on the salad. I'm a healthy eater and don't care for heavy, fatty dressings but come on. You could barely taste the lemon vinaigrette.\n\nOther reviews mentioned poor customer service. Our waitress was attentive and I didn't see other tables having to wait long for service. The music was really good. \n\nHere is a piece of friendly advice: EXPAND YOUR GLUTEN FREE NON MEAT OPTIONS!!! Thank you.
