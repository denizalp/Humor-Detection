I saw Natalie's car one evening on a day when I was feeling particularly big (if you know what I mean)... I took a mental note of her company name (it was marked all over her car) and went home to do some research... I found her website and her blog... and then I saw she'd claimed her business on Yelp so I figured it was a sign... and I gave her a call!\n\nA few days later, Natalie was at my house for my free consultation.  It was good timing, since I'd just found out I had a tax refund coming, so she sold me... an eighteen session package!\n\nI wanted to wait until I could boast a major weight loss before writing this review... but I cannot wait any longer to share Natalie with the rest of you.  While I have yet to see major results, I can say with confidence that Natalie \/ Fitness Elements is fantastic.  She pours her heart and soul into her business and it's evident.  \n\nI know that if I followed Natalie's nutrition and fitness plan (as I am supposed to be doing), I would already be at my goal weight.  Instead, I've had some challenges with travel, eating out, drinking, etc... At least that is what I am calling my excuses for now.\n\nI'm hoping to buckle down and stick to the program so I will see results moving forward.  I'm continuing to meet with Natalie on a weekly basis - i recommend meeting with her more often if your financial situation and schedule allows.\n\nI'll keep you posted on my progress!  \n\nAnd in the meantime, please do not peer pressure me into eating fattening food, drinking, etc... I mean it!  I've got a wedding that is approaching quickly, and I want to be a skinny bride!
