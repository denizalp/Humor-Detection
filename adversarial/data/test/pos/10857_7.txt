Yay Shake Shack is in AZ! I tried it in Chicago back in 2014 and it was an experience. I'm really excited for the Kierland one to open near my house, later this year. Anyways, someone provided a helpful tip on this page to park in the garage and take the elevator up (we took the escalator) and it was right at the end of the wing. The line was out the door around noon today and I placed my order at 12:23, took 10 minutes until my food was ready. I ordered chicken shack burgers, a single shack burger, and a shroom burger. I also ordered fries with cheese on the side and the Dust Devil concrete with added chocolate chunks. The latter two are the winners in my book! That cheese sauce is something else, and the mix of flavors in the frozen custard worked well together. \n\nReally great customer service, one of the employees gave us samples of the custard while we waited in line. My big order was executed correctly and the to-go bags were easy to carry away. Lots of seating and in a good location at the end of the mall, next to the outside parking lot and Thirsty Lion. I want to try some of their shakes so maybe next time.\n\nDefinitely on the pricier side for fast food, but my mom remarked on how good the chicken was and the experience makes it all worth it. They have calories listed next to each item but don't pay attention to those.
