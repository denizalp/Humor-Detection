Sweet Moses? More like SWEET JESUS this ice cream is fantastic. Laid out in the style of an old-fashioned malt shop, this place offers sweet treats that are both plentiful and inexpensive -- a huge-ass turtle sundae will set you back a mere five bucks. And it will be big enough to be your dinner. I went with some drunk friends around 11 p.m. on a Saturday night and got held up in quite the wait, but I guess that's what happens on the rare warm March Saturday in Cleveland, when all the alcoholic hipsters are awoken from their winter slumber. The service itself was fast and friendly, and I hope to make this place a regular hangout in the coming warm(er) months.
