What happened to this place? It is so beyond disgusting. I went here a year and a half ago and it was in such better shape. I moved to Vegas 5 months ago, just stopped in for the first time. The conditions are bad. The poor dogs look so sad and it is evident they are not taken care of. Most of them had   a large amount of old poop lying in the base of their cages. It is soooooo sad. This place needs to go out of business! Save those poor animals!
