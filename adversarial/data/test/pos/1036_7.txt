Great place. Food is great, happy hour is excellent and until 7pm. The new staff is on point. New owners really bringing things together and  bringing out the potential in the bar and location. Crowd is friendly, no drama. Music is excellent (classic rock, blues, etc.) during the week and DJ playing club music on the weekend nights. My new spot for a long time
