June 2014 was the first time I had ever set foot in a gym and I was pleasantly surprised with Yak's Fitness.  It was bright and clean (cleanliness is very important to me) and the staff appeared to be knowledgeable.  I decided on a three month contract and requested a personal trainer.  I was referred to Tamaki who asked me what my goals were and we were off and running.  My progress has been amazing and I attribute it to Tamaki's dedication and caring nature!  Tamaki will motivate and encourage you and if you do the work you will see results.  Tamaki is the only reason I signed up for another three months at Yak's.
