I think the owners of all the Chinese buffets in northeast Ohio got together in 2013 and decided \"let's all be mediocre, that way we'll get equal business\". \n\nFun Buffet in Streetsboro went downhill fast. Mandarin Seafood Buffet in Twinsburg was marginal at best before the remodel and I haven't returned to try it. The Royal Buffet near Chapel Hill is hit or miss. The Pacific Buffet in Macedonia is awful. Most recently, the Evergreen Buffet has begun its decline.\n\nBack in the day, Evergreen was good almost every time. The service was usually attentive, and the food was usually good and at the correct temperature. The last couple times I've visited, including today on New Year's Day, it's just been average to below average. Nothing was particularly bad today, just so-so food that wasn't up to temperature. The young man who is usually at the register is never rude, he just is very curt and unfriendly. He never asks if your meal was good. Today's waiter was also unfriendly and never asked if the food was good.
