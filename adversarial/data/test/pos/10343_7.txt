No attention to detail. After one of the diners in my party found a piece of cardboard in her food, I notified the sous chef, who notified the manager.  We were told her name was Denise.  The lack of concern for accommodating my guest was appalling.  I expected them to at least comp her meal, but she only offered my guest a drink. If this low level of concern exists for what a guest finds in their food, then who knows what goes on where we cannot see. No apology from the manager,  no explanation on how it might have happened,  and no gratitude for pointing out a problem.\n \nAnother in my party got insenced and insisted on finding the casino mgr to share the story. He was angry because the one who found the cardboard was his Mother. The casino manager empathized completely and took good care of my party. Thank you.
