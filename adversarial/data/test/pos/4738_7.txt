If you are thinking of eating here, be sure you fit into one of the following two categories. One, you are not really hungry, but you just want the taste of good food in your mouth. Two, you have stacks of money lying around and are looking for more exciting ways to use it than simply lighting it afire.\n\nI'm honestly not sure why everyone seems to love this place so much. I will acknowledge that yes, the food is tasty. However, the portions are extremely small and priced quite high for what you get. Not to mention a \"main\" is just that, only the main, no sides. If you want a proper dinner with protein and a couple of sides, be prepared to spend $50 per person - and that is without any drinks or appetizers. \n\nI had the duck and my dining partner had the \"large\" kale salad with added sand dabs. We split the mussels and a dessert. Our bill was $73. I don't know that we will return.
