A vibrant bar that is housed by glass giving you a scenic desert Mountain View's. I'm not a regular. I tend to stop by every blue moon and have never been disappointed. The scene is dark with dim lighting. A romantic spot or a nice place to have a relaxing evening. Often there is a live band at night to enjoy while munching on appetizers. I love the menu. Which entails a variety of food and drink offerings. Custom made cocktails for everyone's fancy. The service fits the vibe. Always a pleasure when I drop by.
