When I found out that they opened another location closer to me, I knew I had to check this place out. I got the 5 piece chicken tender combo with two sauces (honey bbq and creamy garlic parmesan).\n\nI was disappointed that the fries I got was all soggy and oily. For those of you who read my other reviews, this is one of my biggest pet peeves. I am not sure if this is just the way they make their fries or if this was a bad batch. If I'm going to eat something unhealthy, it might as well be a good experience! I ended up just eating a few of the fries before I decided to throw them all out (what a waste of money!). The chicken tenders themselves were pretty good. I really enjoyed the honey bbq sauce and it's nice how the chicken is pretty juicy. One thing to note is that the batter isn't as crispy as places like Raising Canes or as flavorful as Popeye's. This basically means you're pretty dependent on the sauces for flavor. \n\nOverall, this place is just okay. I don't think I'll be coming back unless my friends really want to check this place out. I would recommend just going to Canes or BWW.
