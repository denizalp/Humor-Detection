I'm going to risk sounding REALLY not cool here, but why are these places so dirty? When the lights are dimmed but I can still see a thick layer of sediment of ceiling fixtures....that's dirty. I don't know; maybe I need to drink more to see past the filth?\n\nSure, this place has excellent acoustics, and an awesome view, but I'd think twice before returning. There is nothing to do whilst waiting endlessly for acts that invariably start late. I realize the owners want patrons to drink up, but I don't go here for the ambiance. It's downright depressing to sit in the rickety chairs and attempt screaming conversation to kill time.  I thought it was telling to see most people glued to their cell phones until the main act started. I guess I'm not the only bored one here.\n\nThe women's bathroom should win an award for lowest air-pressure hand dryer EVER. Basically it's useless. And would it really kill them to clean the place up? \n\nThat's it...I'm officially old I guess.
