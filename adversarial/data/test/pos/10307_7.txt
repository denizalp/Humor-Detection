It's a little weird writing a review about an ice cream parlour when we're amidst a blizzard that is in full-effect, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and do it anyways.\n\nI'm definitely a huge supporter of any place that has jars and jars of candy lining their establishment. I mean seriously - life doesn't have to be serious ALL the time...;)\n\nMarble Slab is DE-LISH. I'm talkin' ice cream, toppings, mashing, eating, like I said, DE-LISH.\n\nAlthough it's not my *absolute* favourite frozen treat joint in the city, it's great nonetheless.\n\nWhen this blizzard clears up, and it BETTER, ice cream date?
