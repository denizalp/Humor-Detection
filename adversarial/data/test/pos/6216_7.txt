The GM of this hotel contacted me after i mailed in the comment card regarding the disappointing experience.  He was very nice to invite us back to the hotel for a night on the house.    \n\nHowever when we were ready to make the reservation (paying 1-2 nights + 1 free nights for my b-day celebration), i was told the dates we want are around big electronics show (CES 2013), 3 nights non-refundable minimum stay is required and the rate is around $600-$1,000\/night!!\n\nCome on, this hotel is crazy....The dates we want is 2-4 days before the show while all their competitor hotels are doing sales or at least normal rate.  Also no one requires any min. stay or non refundable crap..I have no idea where they get the guts to do this...\n\nThere were some businesses invited us back in the past after our terrible experience, they usually did a wonderful job to win us back ...But Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas disappointed me AGAIN, they simply don't mean to improve their customer service.\n\nThanks but no thanks Mandarin Oriental...i will never stay in any of your hotels although i heard your group has many nice hotels in Asia....
