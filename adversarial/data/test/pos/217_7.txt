I do believe these are the best cupcakes in town.  Cupcakes are just so wonderful anyway, I mean really, they are little packages of love and sunshine and always brighten my day!  \n\nI love that there are just so many flavors to choose from.  I try to try a different every time I visit a Cupcakery and I am always happy with my choice.  I do think they are on the pricey side, but they are delicious, so I always pay the price for them.   \n\nYummy happiness is a small cup, YEAH!!!!
