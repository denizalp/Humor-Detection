Avoid this business at all costs, purchased a stylus as a backup for a vintage turntable I was having re-furbished, in the event I would one day need it, the one day came, and the stylus was for a completely different turntable, upon contacting LP Gear to request a refund or exchange, I was told there would be no exchange or return, and that there would be no further discussion on the matter.  Very poor customer service, and whomever is in charge of their inventory is equally bad.  Avoid at all costs, try Audio Specialist instead on Ventura Boulevard, great service.
