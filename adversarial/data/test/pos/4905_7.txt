Let's be straight- you only get Little Caesars because you are broke, desperate for something fast to eat, throwing a party, or you're fond of mediocre pizza.  I fall into the broke\/desperate to eat categories.\n\nLittle Caesars isn't terrible.... I've certainly paid more for crappier pizza (by accident, of course- not because I enjoy torturing my wallet and taste buds).  But I don't think there's really anyone out there that says, \"Man, I sure could go for some Little Caesars right now!\"  Basically, it's tasty enough to make you think your $6 was not wasted.  Nothing more than that.  \n\nFor this particular location, we've never had to wait for a hot-n-ready and we are usually in and out pretty quickly.  The employees are your typical fast food employees- not the most professional service in the world but fine enough to make a cheap pizza and swipe your credit card.
