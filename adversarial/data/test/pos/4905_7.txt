Was hoping to have a place nearby that is fun with fresh Mexican food.  The place there prior used all real ingredients and had great cooks and fun regulars.\n\nIt is a fine place to get a beer buzz....Staff is a bit clueless and inexperienced.   \n\nMost advice:  USE FRESH PRODUCT.  Everything there is (tastes) frozen or canned.  You know the Guac is not hand made when it is thin as ketchup.  This comes from many years in a kitchen.  :)  You will double your business using better product!  Good luck!
