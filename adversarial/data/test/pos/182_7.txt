Mmmmmm.........I want to tread lightly because I don't want to tick off Guy's fans and I like the ole boy myself. Oh well, here goes.\n\nThis restaurant is new to me as I haven't stayed at Harrah's in a couple of years and this is located right outside going into the The Linq Hotel and Casino next door. Every time I walked past the place it was slam full as most restaurants in Vegas are; especially the celebrity chef restaurants. \n\nI swore I wasn't going to go but on the last day I decided to give it a shot. Place doesn't open until 9 which is fine for Las Vegas but bad for Jeff. Damnit, I was hungry but luckily, the wife keeps mini chocolate bars in her purse for just such occasions when I get hangry and start to hulk out.\n\n9:05 and the three young ladies at the stand still weren't letting us in. Should have took this as a sign but I didn't. Already committed so I stayed the course. Once in and were finally waited on, I went with the simple breakfast platter which included a biscuit (?), eggs, bacon, apple sausage, and roasted potatoes with red peppers and onions. \n\nThe reason for the question mark on the biscuit is cause it didn't look like any biscuit I ever saw but it tasted alright. Downside about it was that it was stone cold. More about that later.\nAs far as the rest of the meal, eggs are eggs, apple sausage was fantastic, bacon was so-so, and the potatoes were delicious.\n\nNow the wife. She went with the biscuit and gravy. The best part of this meal was the country fried bacon. That's right, country fried BACON. The rest of it: I've had way better biscuits and gravy for a third of the price. Gravy was bland and the biscuit was cold.\n\nWe asked our server why our biscuits were cold, figuring it was that way per the chef's (Guy) instructions. He stated that they were supposed to be hot. Also, he told us that they were not prepared fresh every day. After enlightening us to this little tidbit, the manager came out to talk with us. Why, I have no idea. He told us that heat lamp on the food may have not heated the entire meal.\n\nIf my meal is being prepared fresh, It shouldn't have that much time to cool out from under a lamp. Well, they offered to reheat it but that's about it. Not much in the way of compensation after paying $17 for biscuits and gravy.\n\nI have to say, the whole meal was a little pricey even by Vegas standards and I don't have a problem paying the high prices if the food is worth it but just wasn't for us. Hopefully it's just a coincidence but I'm afraid I won't be taking another chance next time I'm in town.
