This is a bit of a hidden gem. There's very little signage (I hope this changes) and you need to take an elevator to the second floor of Markham's old town hall. Once you get there, it's quite a pleasant surprise though! I should have taken a photo of the space; it has a mirrored skylight that makes the restaurant look huge. Despite the illusion, it's actually still quite big for Main Street Markham. The decor is fairly modern but there's photos of old movie stars, etc. throughout. The bar is quite nice; its covered in some kind of shiny tin-like material (I'm sure there's a word for this type of treatment!). \n\nI had the calabrese pizza and it impressed. The crust and ricotta cheese were top notch and the portion size was pretty generous. To drink I had cider, which they have on tap along with a few beers, and I liked that they served in with ice.\n\nFor desert we had the tartufo and it was also excellent.\n\nThe service was helpful and friendly. Despite not being easy to spot from the street, it was relatively full, especially for a Wednesday. I hope word of mouth continues to spread. All in all, this is a great addition to Main Street Markham (take that, Main Street Unionville!).
