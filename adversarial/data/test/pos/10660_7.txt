What I ordered was NOT even close to what I got- The bouquet I saw online and ordered they didn't have anything in stock The floral shop did call to tell me they had none of the flowers or the vase in stock to make the correct arrangement- to which I said that is fine, please make it as similar as possible, with clean lines and such.  What we got was a mess.  The owner did reach out and say he would make it right and resend another bouquet, but my 3 attempts to contact him to confirm delivery were not returned.  I work with small businesses on a daily basis, was very happy that he acknowledged the mistake, but not making the final step happen causes the one star in this review.  Sad, because I really love utilizing LOCAL.
