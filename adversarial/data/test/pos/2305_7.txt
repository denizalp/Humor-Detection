Skip the weekends and check out Sunday School or Wednesday nights, esp for house music. Better yet, go straight to the semi-secret side room for a more intimate setting and better chance of good DJs. Girls get somewhat fast-tracked at the door by signing up in advance on www.napkinights.com (or wearing lingerie on the OUTSIDE of your clothes, of course).
