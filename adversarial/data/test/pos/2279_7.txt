If you are looking for a great company to service your air conditioner, I highly recommend TNA Heating & Air Conditioning.\n\nOur air conditioner went out about a year ago last summer and after hours (really hours) of phone calls getting quotes we found this company. They were less than most ,by at least a few hundred bucks. Plus they came out really quick!\n\nUnfortunately for us, it wasn't just a compressor issue.\nWe had to replace the whole air conditioner (it was 10 plus years old)  :(\n\nThank goodness the price was very reasonable for our brand new TRANE air conditioner, plus it came with a 3 year warranty! Which is pretty cool! lol get it? Cool. Bahh Haa Ha!  I really crack myself up sometimes tee-hee :) Ok ,ok....\n\nSo today they came out (per our request) for our FREE service call to check our A\/C and make sure all was good with Freon etc. Our A\/C is running great!\n\nThank to Iris and TNA Heating &Air Conditioning for your prompt and excellent service.\n\nThis company is outstanding!
