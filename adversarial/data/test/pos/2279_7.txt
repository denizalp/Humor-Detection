I agree with the other reviews. Awesome place for FRESH FRESH FRESH. Catering is very good too. The platters are very fairly priced and boy is there a lot of food on them. Why are there only three locations??? I think I'm going to base my next home location choice on the proximity to Starsky....seriously, the bread, cold cut and cheese selection. Oh My.
