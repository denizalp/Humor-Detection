Québécois nose-to-tail cooking meets contemporary Toronto lounge styles in the Templar Hotel. \n\nStart upstairs for some solid cocktails against a backdrop of glass vessels filled with a mystery liquid and photographed body parts.\n\nContinue the prohibition-era spirit and move to a subterranean dining room that is bursting with raucous good times. It was hella loud and lots of fun. \n\nThere are naughty dishes like the deep fried lamb brains, horse carpaccio and the drop-dead delicious bread pudding dessert.
