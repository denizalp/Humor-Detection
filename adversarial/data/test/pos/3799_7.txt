This store is a little odd, but charming. (That's actually the same thing that I hope that people say about me behind my back.)   It's mostly a candy shop, with an emphasis on UK imports, and the selection is pretty big.  A lot of it is the typical \"Oh I haven't seen this since I was a kid\" stuff that you see in most nice candy shops, but I like the addition of the cool British stuff.\n\nThe reason that I said that the store was odd was that, in addition to candy, there are interesting UK-imported groceries such as jams and jellys.  Most out of place though is a cooler or freezer (I didn't look too closely) full of meat pies.  Also, the lady working there (today at least) could stand to be at least a little bit friendly - it is a candy store after all.  Still, a nice place to pop in if you're in the area.
