Charlotte Friends,\nDO NOT go to Carol Reithmiller CPA or http:\/\/www.ladycpa.com\/ for your Taxes or Accounting needs. This place is a SCAM!\n\nWe signed up on the Dave Ramsey website for a FREE review of my taxes. They put all my information in the computer and came up with an absurd number which I knew was incorrect. One look at each other and we left deciding NOT to do my taxes with them.\n\nThen we got a bill for $669!!! No rates or fees were ever discussed becuase it was a FREE consult and because we had never decided to actually use their services.\n\nWe wrote them that we had never decided to do our taxes there and that we would have never agreed to $669 anyways. So much for a FREE consult! Who would pay $669 for a tax return anyway? Writing the Dave Ramsey website, all the Review Sites and the BBB.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/carol.reithmiller
