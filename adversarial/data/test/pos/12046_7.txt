If you don't easily get offended by profanity or mockery towards you, then I think you will enjoy this restaurant.  It is located inside the Excalibur Hotel Casino in the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSupposedly but not sure, this place is suppose to resemble an east coast attitude type of restaurant.  The satire is to act like rude waiters and waitresses without giving a sh*t about how the patrons feel about the service.  When you first walk in, the hostess asks you if you have ever been here or know what this place is all about. You could say yes or no while you are being seated. But ultimately you will see a sign that tells you as you kind of and can't help but check the restaurant decoratives around the walls.  Or you'll hear profanity being shouted by the servers... of course in the name of fun.  \n\nBelieve it or not,  the food and drinks here are quite good.  We ordered a bacon burger, a local moco, and a rib eye steak along with a hurricane and a strawberry daiquiri slush, an iced tea, and a brownie in a cup topped with whipped cream and jarred cherries. \n\nThe bacon burger was huge. It's prepared with generous proportions of a beef patty and bacon strips with lettuce and tomatoes served with french fries.  It was good.  The local moco was also delicious. The beef patty was also a good size topped with an egg with gravy and some hot sauce with white rice underneath.  It was tasty and I devoured it and wanted to order a second.   The rib eye steak was probably the biggest surprise of our meal.  I really did not expect anything special. I actually tried to persuade my friend to order something else. Oh boy, I was wrong! The rib eye was cooked medium, and the steak was quite big at 14 ounces. It was served with steamed vegetables, but the meat was delicious with flavor.  The iced tea is just iced tea,  but their spiked slushies are awesome.  It's sweet and is fruity... very refreshing but with liquor mixed in it.  However,  the liquor seems more camaflouged in the strawberry daiquiri though... haha.\n\nFyi, all the food and drinks ordered is for three people. In case you thought I was a big eater, which i am. Haha. \n\nDick's is a very fun place to hang out.  Good food and drinks makes a difference. The ambiance is very east coast like indeed along with its attitude.  But you must be able to not get offended easily from what's said, and be cool.  Our waitress was actually really nice even with her wise cracks.\n\nEnjoy your time there and cheers!
