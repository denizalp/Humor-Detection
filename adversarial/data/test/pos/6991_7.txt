I spontaneously went to China City Super Buffet with the intention of trying something new.  Ironically, the experience that I received was far from what I was looking for...\n\nAfter finding this location in the hood, I was promptly seated and went for my first tour of the buffet.  After discovering that the first plate was not clean, I grabbed another and loaded up on some sushi.  It wasn't great sushi, but it wasn't bad either... it just didn't taste that fresh.  On my second trip, I grabbed some mixed rice, orange chicken, beef, and some cooked shrimp (with the head on).  Everything was quite lukewarm.\n\nFortunately, I was still using the chopsticks that I used for my sushi as I sifted my way through the rice.  Then, I found the special surprise of the day in my rice: AN INSECT LEG!!!\n\nNow, I'll gladly admit that I'm not an expert when it comes to bugs.  I've seen plenty in my day, from cockroaches to bees and even crickets.  So, I can't say for sure which kind of insect that this leg came from, but I am absolutely sure that it didn't belong in my food.  After discreetly taking pictures, I called for the manager and showed her the evidence.  She tried to act like the two-jointed leg was a black thread as she held it up to her black shirt.  Good try lady- I may look dumb, but I am not stupid.\n\nLong story short, I will not return and only recommend this place if you are really open to wanting any kind of extra protein in your diet.  Two photos of the leg are attached for your viewing pleasure.
