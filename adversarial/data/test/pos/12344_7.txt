YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(184\/365) \"Sweet Spot\"\n\nWow! there really isn't a bad spot in the house! Huge, spacious venue, comfy stadium style seating, great sound throughout the entire period. What more could you ask for?\n\nWe came to see Shania Twain (Review of the show to follow) Special effects used for the show were great too. Upon entering, the ushers tell you that the usage of cameras, video recorders, and cellphones are not allowed, but unfortunately in this day and age of your i-Phones and Samsung Galaxies, that's not gonna happen, especially if its the performer herself taking selfies with her fans!  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  4
