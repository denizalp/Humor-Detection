So a friend lives here and this place is horrid! I helped them move their things in, and when I walked in the front door I saw dead roaches. They asked the office staff and they denied any insect problems, but funny things they said they sprayed regularly. Anyhow, There are a million units in this complex, so many they have 3 different addresses...but if you judge by the entrance they would appear small and quaint. \n\nSo beside the roach problem...this place has nasty, disgusting cats EVERYWHERE! I swear there is a cat living under each car and a sh*t load by the garbage cans. The people here are nosey. That may not even be an issue, but I can't understand why they all keep they're doors open. I'm surprised one of those strays hasn't ran in an apartment. \n\nWhomever manages this complex gets the middle finger! Whenever I come over here the grass is being soaked to death! The last time I checked Arizona was one of the states in a drought. Water is literally pooling on the sidewalk. Being sustainable wouldn't hurt. From what I've been told these apartments run about $800+ for a two bedroom. Not even worth it. They are disguised as apartment homes but I think they're really housing projects.\n\nI believe they just got security the times I waited in the car for my friend they flashed the light on me and asked if I was a resident and who I was there to see. Well excuse me for waiting in the car. I didn't know I was in the Hampton. Anyhow skip this cat trap and keep looking.
