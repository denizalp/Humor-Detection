Photography is terrible!! For it being a place to get married you think they would hire good photographers for \"that special day\". And the memories that photos hold. Complete amateurs! Poses in front of plug outlets, bad positions, terrible aiming..If I could turn back time I would not have chosen this place. As I was also promised a group photo with all my guests to find out when I was done with the lame photo session inside, everyone was gone because the staff told them they had to leave because another wedding was scheduled. But I paid for an amount of time on the premises! Flowers were pretty if that helps.
