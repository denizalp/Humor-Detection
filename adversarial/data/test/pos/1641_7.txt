I had the oddest and worst service in my life at Jammy Buggars this Saturday afternoon. I would love to give more stars for the food and the atmosphere and the beer. I should have liked this place! I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try because everything on the menu sounded great. I went with the beer battered fish sandwich and regular fries. I LOVED the fries. I was planning on coming back to try the Mac & Cheese, and the different styles of toppings on the fries... \n\nBut the service was horrible! If it was this girl's first day, she should have still had her trainer standing with her. To talk for her. Because she couldn't. It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen in a restaurant. Were there specials? I don't think she even told us her name. My friend ordered a chicken hoagie, and she said, \"ok.\" There was silence. I wasn't going to start my order yet, because aren't there some other things to discuss? My friend had to say for herself \"That comes with fries?\" It felt like we were pulling teeth, like we were taking the order for ourselves. It was so odd (and irritating)! \n\nHere's where it gets even more so. I had almost finished my beer and had eaten half of my meal. Unnamed Waitress asks if I would like a box. When she brings it back, I tell her we are stepping outside for a cigarette and will be right back. Two minutes into our standing outside the front window and door, with our backs to our booth, the bus girl comes running outside with my umbrella, telling me I forgot it. I told her I did not, because we haven't left yet. We looked over our shoulders inside to see all our plates and glasses stacked up at the end of the table! She bussed our table, and I hadn't even put my food in the box yet. I wasn't done eating my fries! I wanted to finish my beer! I TOLD THE WAITRESS where we were going! \n\nWant to see it get even more weird? When we got back to our table, the plates and glasses were all spread out again. She UNBUSSED our table!!! Who does that?! Has that ever happened in the history of restaurants ever?! Were we expected to finish our food still?\n\nAny minor problem in my previous dining history has always been resolved sufficiently by the server, so it didn't even occur to me until later that I should have asked for her manager. When I informed our server of the problem, she said she'd go ask the bus girl what happened. I had hope that she was actually talking to her boss. She came back and offered us each a free drink. We took it, and although I felt we deserved a bit more than that, considering half my meal cost more than a drink, I just wanted this horrible service to end.\n\nI have had better service at Denny's.\nI have had my order taken better at McDonald's.
