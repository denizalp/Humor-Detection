First off, I'd like to give a shout & say thanks to Misti for the review! Your experiences are very helpful to the community.\n\nI was around the area one night to gas up at the station inside that business plaza. Immediately, my eyes feasted upon the Popeyes adjacent to the gas stop, so my mind fixated on a meal there. Luckily, I decided to yelp nearby eats! & good thing I did! I read up some reviews on Phat Phrank's, and after some thoughtful reviews I stepped inside. \n\nFrank really is a music enthusiast, I've spoken to him on it.. but music is not what this review is about! \n\n2 Words: Fish tacos. \nI've tried something different every visit (being a regular): carne asada tostada, trainer salad (recommend if you're going \"green\"), barbacoa tacos, but oh sweet fishies, their fish tacos hook you! Get it...? Hook you..? No?.. I tried. \n\nFrank tells me that their breakfast burritos are recommended. & that's exactly what I'm getting next! I mean.. after 3 fish tacos, please! :]\n\nP.S. We know you're thinking about opening weekends, and we all agree. Please do (even just for lunch or dinner) ! :D
