The best fish and chips I've have thus far. The fish is fresh, flavorful, and crispy without being heavy or greasy. You get steaming, flaky, tender Atlantic Cod without any fishy flavor whatsoever. The fries are crispy and light, and taste great \"dirty\"-style with Parmesan, truffle oil and chives. My wife had the chicken and chips, which were equally as great. With a choice of two dipping sauces per combo, there's no limit to the flavor combinations you can create. I had the mango curry and euro-style mayo, which were both delicious. I paired my meal with Gordon's beer recommendation, the Innus and Gunn. This place is a must-stop whenever you're on the strip!
