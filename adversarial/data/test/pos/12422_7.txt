Great food , HORRIBLE SERVICE.  The waitress purposely overcharged us and when I asked for an itemized receipt she said \"too late\"... as we left  she was taunting us under her breath.  The jumbalaya is unreal and I was a fan for life, not anymore.  Im going to David's Jamaican where they RESPECT !
