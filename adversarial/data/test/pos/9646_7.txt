This place is GROUND ZERO for Summerlin MILF's. If you are on the prowl, then the Kona is a 5+ star rating.  I sometimes used this place as a last stop after a few pops at the Three Angry Wives, in case I needed to see some cleavage. Food is great. Waitstaff is kinda pretentious. The mister on the patio is nice during the Vegas heat, and you can chortle at the D-bags that use the valet parking to show off their Lambos and trophy dates, errrr- escorts. I dunno-- I think you should just check it out for yourself.  Good luck!
