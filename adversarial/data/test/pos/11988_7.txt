You know what's bitter and twisted? Calling this vintage cocktail parlor-themed restaurant\/bar mitzvah party\/late night Vegas hotel joint nonsense a cocktail parlor. \n\nOf course, my imagination had me like... dark, smoky New Orleans-hotel-bar circa 1910? Just let me grab my brand new cigarette holder, darling.\n\n*record spins to a scratchy stand-still*\n\nFast-forward: It's 2015, and the most consumable thing at this restaurant is a ramen burger. A gastropub-tastic, spicy, juicy burger between crisp ramen patties, served with moist wipes for your sauce-covered paws. The tagine, which was was described to us as having \"Moroccan sauce on it,\" was also a contender. (Vivid description provided by suspender-clad angel.)\n\nBut wait - the drinks! The corpse reviver reminded me of weak jungle juice delivered in a glass vessel. The Ramos gin fizz was perfectly mediocre, but isn't on the menu, and was served in about 5 minutes (as in, no shaker boy spent more than 30 seconds shaking it.) Welp, we definitely ain't in New Orleans, anymo'.\n\nThe tagline is \"drink better,\" but some of us would have to first drink far worse in order to drink better at B&T.
