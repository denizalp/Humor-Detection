This location of Maricopa OBGYN called my cell phone for 2 WEEKS day and night, trying to send a fax to a cell phone. Brilliant though medical front office personnel are, they couldn't bother to call the number they were trying to fax and see if it was actually a fax machine. I called and left a voicemail, after at least 100 calls from their fax machine, and the faxes still continued to come. Delightfully, they dropped me as a patient because I was done getting fax machine calls. Considering they can't send a fax properly, perhaps this is in my best interest. Thanks Maricopa OBGYN! You guys are real winners.
