My boyfriend and I were going to head out to Little Italy this weekend for the Feast of Assumption, but we decided to stop into Osteria for a few cocktails and appetizers first.  I had taken him here before a year ago for his birthday and we had a great experience. Very intuitive and attentive service, divine food and even a friendly invite back for their live Sinatra singer! We've been meaning to come back to check it out since then, but just got around to it now. \n\nWOW. \n\nForget about \"The Feast\"...we stayed at Osteria all night! \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere was so awesome. You feel like you're in a private club for A-listers, but it's also really romantic. It's like we were part of an elite group of people who knew about this Cleveland gem, and they like it that way!  The lighting is dim, the space is modest and quite small, but the lounge singer is what really made the night. Rick, who was one half the Sinatra-ish style lounge act called \"Rick & Sharona\", kept us dancing and smiling all night long. He was so interactive and nice. At one point he even threw top hats out to the ladies (me included) and encouraged us to get up and have some fun. \n\nThe service was impeccable, as usual. We immediately grabbed a seat at the bar so we could have a great view of the singer. The bartender helped me pick a great wine, I didn't even have to ask! It's like he read my mind.  For the rest of the night, our glasses never went empty. He was always there when we needed something, but not annoying.  \n\nThe food? Oh my god, the food!! I mean, I wasn't surprised that it was amazing...it was last time too. But nothing can really prepare you for biting into the creamy, fresh taste of buffalo mozzarella cheese, breaded and served with a cucumber puree and herbs.  The crustini with chef inspired spreads was not only fun to eat, but delicious. There was a white bean hummus, sun-dried tomato, pesto and a roasted mushroom spread...YUM! Even something as simple as the caprese salad blew us away! They used a balsamic vinaigrette reduction that was divine. \n\nWhat an incredible night at Osteria. Slow dancing, singing, and laughing all while enjoying incredible cuisine. What more could you ask for? If you're looking for an authentic Italian dinner mixed with romance and fun, this is where you need to go!
