before i came to factory direct, i had never seen or heard of dryer balls before.  they look like a dog toy.\n\nbefore i came to factory direct i thought it was basically a discount computer and electronics store, which in part it is except for things like\n\nbasketballs\n(dryerballs)\nautomatic handheld car dusters\nstrange red hampers or garbage cans (see photos)\nergonomic fruit cleaners\n\nhows that for a stocking stuffer list?\n\nthese stores in general kind of depress me.  would someone think that they need a basketball and travel all the way to factory direct to get it?\n\ni think i would buy cheap power bars (not the kind you can eat but if you search hard enough ill bet they have them) and see how that goes first because i do believe that you get what you pay for, especially at a store like this.
