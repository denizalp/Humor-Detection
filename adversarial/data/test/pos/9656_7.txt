Pretty typical Burger King experience.. The location and proximity to the Rapid stop at 117th is the ONLY reason that I would eat at this place... You usually get to see a show of some kind while eating\/waiting on your food... \n\nI've seen a guy spill an entire big boy while trying to pour it into a water bottle... Many a bum asking for cash.. and some of the messiest children\/adults in the world.
