Our dinner at CHOP, next to Chinook Scotiabank theatres, was a good experience. We arrived at around 6:40 p.m., but had we arrived at 6, we probably would have made the 7 p.m. movie showings next door. \n\nWe ate in the dining room, not the lively lounge upstairs. The d√©cor of CHOP is lovely, equipped with large comfortable booths and a good amount of natural light. \n\nWe started with a Caesar ($6 Wed special), good flavor, fresh celery and red pepper, spiced perfectly. \n\nOur mains were both good. The Hunter Chicken ($25) was chicken breast with a mushroom sauce, seared crispy skin, seasoned well. The skin under the sauce got soft so I opted to remove that but the meat was delicious, tender and of a good size. Also was wasabi-infused mashed potatoes (no wasabi flavor that I could tell) and perfectly cooked green beans and red peppers. \n\nThe large prime rib ($35) came with one side, we didn't opt to go for the \"Chop Experience Dinner\" which would have meant for the same price we'd get a petite prime rib instead of large but also two sides (rice, baked potato, mashed potato, fries) plus a starter salad OR soup. We were happy with the large prime rib and one side, of which we got to choose a seasonal offering, lobster mashed potatoes. Not a lot of lobster. But excellent prime rib. They said it would melt in your mouth. It does melt in your mouth. We asked for it to be cooked medium. \n\nFinally the Caribbean Rum Cake with vanilla gelato. Excellent. We ordered the mini size ($4). \n\nGreat dinner. Our server Jesse was cool. He looked like Justin Bieber. The Biebs serving you a delicious large prime rib is solid good.
