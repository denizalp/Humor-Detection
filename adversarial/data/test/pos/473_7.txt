If it were run by overprotective parents it would be Smother India. Whereas if it were run by my sibling, it'd be Brother India. And if it were run by my childhood best friend, it'd be Brotherfromanothermother India.\n\nWhat to get: Chicken Tikka Masala with Roti or Rice\nWhat not to get: India-pendence from the bloody Brits, not without a lot of bloodshed first :(\n\nWays to improve: Slightly lower prices, slightly shorter wait times\n\nIt may take awhile for your wonderful, delicious Roti to be ready, but it's worth the wait. The lovely young woman serving here does so with a smile, and is as gracious and welcoming has her food is magnificent.\n\nIndian food is plentiful in Toronto, but few places blend the spices with fresh doughy roti as wonderfully and magnificently as Mother India. I think it is quite liberal use of the word mother, because I doubt too many Indian mothers can make their food taste this good.\n\nThe Tikka Masala dish borrows from British Indian food, invented by immigrants to the UK from India, which itself borrows from the original Subcontinent dishes. The Canadian incarnation of this - complete with the wonderful floury slippery roti skins, and the piping hot blend of spices and chicken inside - is unmissable. If you haven't made your way out to the West end of town for some of the ethnic delights - Indian, Caribbean and many more - along Queen St W, then you have yet to truly experience the breadth and deliciousness of the magnificent food choices in Canada's largest city.\n\nAnd if it existed in a world where the bloody Brits had never invaded and colonized India in the first place, then it would be \"Another India.\" But we can't undo the heinous actions of our past. Unfortunately, we also seem unable and unwilling to learn from them.
