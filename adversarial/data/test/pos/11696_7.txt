Great concept for a night club certainly the performers were outstandingly talented...However to my disappointment ...I contacted the club to your mobile texting through FB and requested to be on a guest list...To my understanding in most of the high end nightclubs I go to..If you made an effort to sign up and text ahead to be in the guest list...that means exactly that! You are a guest...and should not have to Pay the cover charge ($30.00)...$10 discount? Seriously ? It's not really the money but the principle behind a \"guest list...\" My suggestion to you..just don't solicit guest on FB ..and if we go...You'll just make money off from us...You have a great concept of entertainment ...people will spend money in your club once inside...You don't need to nickel and dime your \"Guest!\"
