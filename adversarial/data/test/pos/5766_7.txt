This cinemark is located inside the SunCoast Hotel and Casino. We saw the Big Short here and the theater was clean and the staff were friendly.  The big drawback to this theater is it is inside the casino so you have to walk through the smokey casino to get to it. Not sure if I'd want to bring kids through a smokey casino to watch a movie. That's just my opinion though. They offer a discount for military and students but you need to bring an ID for EACH ticket you purchase with that discount. So if you send someone ahead of time to purchase tickets; you have to give them your ID to prove hat each ticket purchased as a valid military or student ID to go with it. It's a little too strict in my opinion. And Tuesday's all movies are discounted 5.75.
