Looking for a new four-legged family member? Try these guys. They're one of the few animal rescue organizations with a true \"no-kill\" policy - they keep their animals until they can find a forever family. They've saved more than 9,000 dogs and cats from Maricopa County's euthanasia lists since 1995.\n\nI've adopted two wonderful dogs from them over the years. And now, to thank them for matching me with such great critters, I volunteer my time walking dogs for them, since they have no central facility. Most of their animals reside in volunteer foster homes and leased boarding facilities.\n\nTheir matchmaking process is superb - they are truly committed to finding the perfect home for each animal.
