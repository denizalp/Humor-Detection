Ok, let us start with yes, i would definitely come back here.\n\nWe came on a Friday night, after a day of skating, walking Queen West back and forth between Yonge and Bathurst, and after grabbing a bao at Bahn Mi. Well, I had a bao and some other stuff...but whatever, we were still hungry.\n\nTHE SERVERS ARE GODDAMN GORGEOUS!!!!!! These girls are just wow. So pleasant to look at. Kinda made me blush and such...but so pretty. I don't know anything about their intelligence, I think it's kind of weird that a lot of people are giving them a hard time because they...look good? Don'e be a hater. \n\nDrinks were normally priced, like any upper-scale than dive bar in Toronto (premium dive bar?). I think my pint of Sapporo was $7, big friggin woop that's how much I would pay anywhere...$5-7 seems reasonable.\n\nWe waited about 10 min for a table, it was crazy busy. Friday and all.\n\nOrdered foodz:\n- Mac and cheese - big portion, MEH. The cheese wasn't cheesy enough :(\n- Chorizo dip - MY FAAAVORITE. Really good. Really chorizo-ey. Next time I go for this (I shared).\n- Wings. I don't recommend...they're really really dry. And small. \n- Apple pie with ice cream - I didn't try this but it was huge and my friend really was a fan, so I will take his reaction and translate it into words because I don't do sweet stuff.\n\nI saw a bunch of people get salads and burgers and they looks delicious, burger smelled delicious too and was surprisingly large and in charge.\n\nI would give the food a 3\/5. Eat somewhere else. But it's a good place to gab snacks and beers.\n\nThe one this I really didn't like is the music. Turn that sh*t down people I walked away with a buzzing in my ears. SO LOUD!!! \n\nAnother thing that was hilarious is what's going on around the bar area. This is like a sitcom, no joke. The bar tends are beyond hipster... I'm talking like tank tops with sides cut out all the way to the belt of their pants, tattoos peaking out of every hole and cut. Amazing. Oh and hats, and beards! And they all dance and jump around and sing into the drink dispenser. It was entertaining to watch...like a hipster episode of Cheers, if Cheers was a musical. \n\nAnyway, it's worth a try. I wanna try more food, and I would definitely come back. Just turn down the music, a tiny bit. Please.
