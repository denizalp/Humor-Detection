I have to agree with everyone.  The menu is extensive, which is a good thing.  No matter who you go with, you'll all find something you like.\nBUT\nI hate the atmosphere.  I hate the crowd.  I hate the NOISE!  I feel like part of a herd of cattle there.\nThey have one salad I like.  It's got walnuts, pears and a good raspberry vinaigrette.  \nThe cheesecake?  Well, being from NY, I find it mediocre.  \nI got a gift card for CF last year for my birthday.  I re-gifted it.
