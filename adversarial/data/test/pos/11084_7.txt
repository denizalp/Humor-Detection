Pineapple coconut cookie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nWow\nWow\nWow\nMuffins and donuts looked amazin\nThese things ain't small by any means. What I liked about the snickerdoodle is that it was a lil crunchy on the outside, tender inside but not doughy even though it's kinda thick. Sorry about no pics.... they didn't last that long
