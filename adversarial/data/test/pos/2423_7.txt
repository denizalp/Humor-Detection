Second time coming to this restaurant, the first time was at the location Downtown st Catherine and I wasn't a huge fan. This Saturday decide to stop off somewhere to eat before heading home and we didn't want McDonald or subways.\n\nIt was pretty busy but we were seated quickly in a nice section not the bar.\n\nDrinks came quickly which is an automatic star right there lol.\n\nThe cheese sticks weren't my style I prefer mozzarella that's what I thought they were gonna be but it ended up being orange cheese inside super disappointed. Mini burgers were packed with flavour and sweetness. The salad was great could of been better with big croutons but the  chicken was cooked well and chopped up nice and thinly plus very well seasoned.\n\nService was over all great \nFood was good \nI would come back to this location
