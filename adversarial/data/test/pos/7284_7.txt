Not many options for udon in town, now with Monzo closed down and just Cafe Sanuki as the other udon joint. \nI've tried their curry, beef sukiyaki, kimchi, and Nabeyaki udon so far. The udon noodles here are solid with great texture, not too chewy nor too soft. It's fresh and homemade. However, the broth has been salty lately. Will have to ask them to adjust it next time. \nThey have a pretty big selection of tapas, and I was surprised by how fresh their sashimi was! I had the \"Energy Bowl,\" which is basically a chirashi bowl, and it was one of the best chirashi bowls I've had in awhile. Crazy considering it was at an udon spot. \nService is always great. \nIf you're craving udon, this is thee spot in Vegas.
