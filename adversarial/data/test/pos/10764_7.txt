I've been going to a lot of new ice cream places lately and I gotta say, Bang Bang is good. Real good. Was it \"wait an hour behind four smokers while they blow cancer into my face\" good? Well...no. But I wouldn't mind coming again when the wait isn't as crazy. \n\nThey've got some pretty interesting options for consuming your ice cream. You can get your ice cream pressed between two cookies, sandwiched in between a pastry (a puff), or rolled up in a HK style egg waffle. Being a square, I decided these were too exciting for me to handle, and opted for two (generous) scoops in a cup. \n\nThere was still plenty of excitement in the flavours themselves. I'm a big fan of having lots of choices, and Bang Bang had a wall full of choices. Ended up with the London Fog (originally wanted Campfire Marshmallow, but they were out) and Burnt Toffee. The London Fog was amazingly flavoured. Tasted exactly like Earl Grey tea, but in ice cream form. The Burnt Toffee was equally amazing, but much sweeter, with actual toffee ribbons and hard bits in the ice cream. I'm glad the Burnt Toffee was under the London Fog or it would've overwhelmed it. \n\nOther flavours that I got to try were To-taro, love oolong time, banana pudding, mango and sticky rice (yes, actual sticky rice), and vegan vanilla which tastes more like coconut than vanilla. They were all great selections but I actually enjoyed my combination the most. For my lactose intolerant friend, vegan ice cream is always a bonus. \n\nI don't think I'd ever wait for an hour for ice cream again, even though it was amazing, 5-star worthy ice cream. Knocked off a star for the ridiculous wait and also because the servers don't seem to care that it's a ridiculous wait. While they weren't rude, you'd think there might be a bit more of a hustle when the line is stretching down the street. But I guess when you have people willing to wait that long for you, why spend the extra energy?\n\n(53\/100) - 2016
