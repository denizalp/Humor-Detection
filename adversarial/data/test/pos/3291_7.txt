Housed in the former Hawaiian Tropic space it appears that not much has changed on the service front. We stopped by for happy hour which included $3 domestic drafts and had to practically shoot a gun in the air to get a bartenders attention. With the exception of the lack of bikinis, the bartenders are just as inattentive, robotic and surly as the former bartenders at HT. With cheap beer flowing like water on the strip there is really no reason to visit the PBR again.
