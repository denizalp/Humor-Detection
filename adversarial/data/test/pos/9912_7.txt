When it comes to the W club scene, I am not at all impressed. We bought two tables at $400 to celebrate a girlfriend's bachelorette party and were able to bypass the goofy waiting line to get into the \"standard area\" at 10pm. Little do the people know once allowed upstairs with the secret passcode (lame) when you ask a guard where the washroom is, they will send you through the double doors where you are trapped inside a stairwell! At the bottom, it opens up to the street where another guard yelled at me to close the door back up! No matter what somebody says, avoid double doors!!!!
