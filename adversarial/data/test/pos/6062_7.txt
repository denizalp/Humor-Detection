i used to come here a couple of times a week as a child.\n\ncame back here a week ago and they still remembered me.  some things have changed from the past the good food is still here.\n\nif you are looking for traditional french fare, come on by.  unlike paris, the portions are quite generous.\n\ni had the escalope de veau which was delicious - i ate the whole plate.\nmy parents and brother (despite their freak of nature ability to eat a whole cow gene) all took home leftovers for the ris de veau, the confit de canard and the jarret d'agneau.\n\nthe house own wine used to be much better and measured by the pours but times have changed.  still not bad.\n\nof course, a meal is nothing without dessert so try the creme brulee but i prefer the profiteroles - yummy puffs with ice cream and hot choco sauce.\n\non sundays, they have their legendary mille feuille.  a definite to try item!
