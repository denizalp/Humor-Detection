Vegas overall was an amazing experience. My tattoo experience in Vegas? One I wish I could forget, but SHIT, I have a crap tattoo stuck to my inner leg for life!\n\nI'm exaggerating a bit, just because it's not the worst tattoo in the world but for the price and the now extreme blotchly-ness, I wish we would have chosen another tattoo parlor! \n\nMy boyfriend and I got tattoos the size of a half dollar and paid over 200.... each. Embarrassing to admit that I have tons of tattoos and know the price was ridiculous? YES, but it's Vegas and we were winning so we didn't give a crap. The shop layout is very nice with touch screen tattoo portfolios and lots of merchandise.\n\nThe tattoo did not heal well and needs to be recolored, but I feel like that adds the Vegas touch to it. Hey, at least I'm being optimistic.
