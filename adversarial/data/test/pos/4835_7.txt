Came there on a Saturday afternoon, yes for breakfast after a spa treatment.  The wait was 20 mins, GAME!  I heard it can be up to 1 hour (yikes).  So 10 mins in, they text me - Table is ready.  Woot woot!  Love the atmosphere.  Cool tables, chairs, and decor.  I got seated in the back of the place, nice.  I got a green hot tea.  They give you the full on leaves and everything (you know it is pretty good tea).  I got the Breakfast Pot Pie, it was ok.  It was a little bland, needed to add a tab of salt.  I had to get the chocolate chip pancake as a side.  YUM!  The service was great too!  Hash browns could have been a bit crispier.
