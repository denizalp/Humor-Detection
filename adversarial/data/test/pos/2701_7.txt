Typical visit at this place. Food on the floor. Dirty tables and floors. Why am I here?  Oh yea. Lunch.\n\nUpdate: they let dogs in. Not service dogs. Just any ol dogs. Weird for a minute there I thought I was eating where they prepare food in a sanitary manor. Hmmm. I guess if I bring my giraffe it'll be ok. After all it's del taco. And not just ANY del taco. It's my least favorite del taco. \n\nSo I decided to have 3 tacos cuz it's taco night and I'm cheap. No cheese. None. I think my daughter had one that had 3 whole strands. How can I complain? It's taco night. \n\nTwo stars this time cuz heck it's starting to make me laugh a little. At least if nothing else it fills the gap in the tummy and provides cheap entertainment. Hey I wonder if we can get that dog into a tutu to jump they a fiery hoop or something?
