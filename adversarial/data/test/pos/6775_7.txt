You get a loud welcome from the girls when you walk in. The restaurant is covered in animal heads, antlers and tvs. Our server was Julia. She was very nice and attentive.  All the servers are pretty cute, fit, and young. \n\nMy bf ordered the chicken strips.  She asked what sauce, so our friend said honey mustard, my bf and I said ranch at the same time.  I pulled her aside and said we could just share one ranch.  I also ordered ONE pretzel.  Our order was brought back and we got 2 pretzels and also 2 ranch(there is a charge per ranch).  I asked about the pretzel, they were willing to take it back. However, the boys agreed to eat it.  The food wasn't bad, typical bar food.  Actually better food than the restaurant most adjacent.  Our friend joined the table much later. Very quickly our server came to ask what he would like to drink. Good job! \nMy bf ordered another small beer but then she brought back the large one.  We never had to wait on our service, but she did not always get it right. \n\nThey offer a fun 4 person shot on a ski. Chanting, \"shotski! Shotski! Shotski!\"  At some point some hip hop music was blasting loud on the speakers during the shot ski. (The speakers were LOUD) \n\nThis spot is like a hooters but with mid drifts.   I think this location is more attractive than the one on the strip.  Will for sure be a hang out for us close to home.  I'd say generously 3 stars for food.  And an extra one for the experience the boys enjoyed the atmosphere.  Wish the girls stopped by our table more, I feel like since I'm a girl maybe they didn't want to?
