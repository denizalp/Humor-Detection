Bagel Gourmet might be a rough gem that's located by the Fry's Super Market on Bell Rd with all the solar tiles that cover the parking lot.\n\nThis might be the most unusual Bagel Shop out there. Besides an assortment of bagels, sandwiches, wraps, salads, deviled eggs and more...this bagel shop SERVES UP JAPANESE FOOD!\n\nI noticed that the bagels are very large so we just shared a sandwich. We shared a fresh made bagel with nova lox and cream cheese. The bagel seemed very freshly made but was somewhat roll like. The cream cheese was thinly spread on both sides of the bagel and the vegetable layers of tomato and onion included and unusual addition of cucumber. The nova lox was better than what you can purchase from Fry's but wasn't the best. This was an OK sandwich. Not the best and not the worst but it was very large and very inexpensive.\n\nAs for the Lunch Box menu they also serve up Teriyaki, Yaki Soba, Fried Rice and Dumplings.\n\nService was SPEEDY\n\nAtmosphere is very dated\n\nPrices are very low\n\nThey have indoor and outdoor seating
