Shopping center with all the trimmings. They have everything that's required by \"Shopping Center Law\" - a supermarket, a hardware store, a post office, a bagel\/coffee shop, a hair salon and if you look really close in the back, they have a shoe repair shop and a dry cleaners.\n\nEven though they have adhered to the Law, they have exceeded the number of speed bumps that should be permitted in such a place. Bam! Bam! Bam! They keep the speed down, which is a good thing because the pedestrians tend to not look for cars and just step out into traffic. Then there are the drivers who don't look for pedestrians. I'm talking to you, elderly lady in the land yacht!\n\nYou can park and pop into the post office, or you can use one of the drive-up mailboxes.\n\nGetting out can be a good time. It's well worth your effort to drop down to the lower exit where there is a traffic light.
