Last Friday was my second visit to Lola. Ah.. my darling Lola. How I love you. Maybe I love Lola because it's a cozy (sometimes crowded) place with communal seating. Maybe I love it because I'm nosy and like to engage random unknown people in deep conversation. Or maybe I just love simple and delicious food. \n\nLola Tapas offers a limited menu that consists of favorites from Spain. The last time I was there myself and two pals had about 6 plates and a sangria for about 30 bucks each (that included tip). Is it pricey? Yes, but it is also well made and delicious. I highly recommend the fillet and and the tortilla de patatas. Do not go to Lola expecting Mexican dishes. An example is the tortilla is not a masa based flat bread. It's actually more of an omelet but not as \"eggy\". Just try it. You will be so glad you did. The ingredients are so fresh and well crafted, that it's hard to mess up here.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and quick. He even recognized me from my first visit. Any of the servers are there to help you so don't be afraid to ask any one of them for something. They all share gratuity so everyone is glad to help where they can.\n\nI won't write too much about my love affair with Lola, but I do know that it will happen again and again. My devotion for Lola is strong. \n\nGrab a few good friends who are fellow foodies and visit Lola. Tell her I said hello!
