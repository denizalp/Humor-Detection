Wow, the dispatcher picks up the phone sounding annoyed that I called, then immediately puts me on hold.  Okay fine, maybe he's working a double, I can forgive the attitude.  When he gets back on the phone, I tell him I need a ride to the airport, give him my location in Chandler, and ask for an estimate.  His reply: \"I don't even know where that is\".  Wow!  I then asked if he would like me to google that for him, and he said \"hold on\". Thats when I hung up.  If I ran a cab company, the last thing I would ever want to hear out of any of my employees mouths would be \"I don't know where that is\", there are plenty of other words you can use, when you don't know a specific location.  The initial attitude, I could forgive, the attitude plus outright stupidity; one single shinny gold star for you my friend.
