I've always marveled at people who ate sushi, yakisoba etc in Japanese restaurants. Being a vegetarian it's often to find actual entrees to eat in a Japanese place and I get bored with the customary \"VEGETABLE ROLL\" in every other sushi restaurant. \n\nMiko's to the rescue! I discovered this place while I was perusing Happy Cow (the veg website) one morning and immediately (I mean literally the minute after I read the menu I was out of the office) I galloped away to Miko's. From then on, I've been coming here regularly for my Japanese fix. This place has a SEPARATE VEGETARIAN\/VEGAN menu!!!!\n\nLocated quite conveniently in the Windmill\/Warm Springs\/Gillespie area (my sense of direction as you can tell is awful), this is a small establishment owned by a cute Japanese couple and the chef here is this 80 year old Japanese sushi chef who came out of retirement to cook here. Imagine that! \n\nThese are the items I love to order:\n\n1. Vegetable Salad - I ask them to add tofu for protein. Comes with an out of this world sesame miso dressing. I have been to every grocery store and even tried to home-make the dressing but to no avail. This dressing is really to die for\n\n2. Vegetable Tempura - When ordered off the Vegetarian menu, the tempura batter used is eggless. The oil that the tempura is fried is changed often so the taste is fresh and pure. My husband loves the tempura here and cannot leave without getting at least a half order. Crispy and fresh, this is really the best tempura I've had\n\n3. Rolls - We love the ladybug roll (avocado, sriracha and some other pickled veggies). The sensation of the heat of the sriracha is so surprising on a roll like this. We also love some other rolls here but I forget their names. Chances are, you won't be disappointed. We order our rolls with soy paper\n\n4. Yakisoba - Yum Yum....Full of oil but if you're ready for a splurge go ahead and order this one. Vegetarian yakisoba...mmmm...no complaints at all!\n\n5. Ramen - On a cold day (or if you are sick), this is such a feel good meal. Generous helping of noodles (tastes fresh) and onions and sprouts. We add tofu to our ramen. It's so satisfying\n\nThere are so many other amazing dishes here. Our friends who are not vegetarian like their seafood dishes too. \n\nCons of this place: A little on the pricey side esp for vegetarians\/vegans as there are no set menus or specials. They are not open during lunch.
