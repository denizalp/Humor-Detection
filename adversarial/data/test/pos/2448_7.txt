Booze in mason jars reminds me of bootleg liquor, moonshine and awesomeness. So it doesn't really get any better than this! Their concoctions are inventive, delicious and there is a selection for you, no matter your liking.  To boot, No. 2 is much bigger than the original Distillerie, but offers the same great ambiance and service, just less cramped. \n\nJust be warned: anything can happen at Distillerie. So be sure to open yourself up to good - even unexpected - times!
