Great family restaurant. Beats franchise ones like Kelsey's or Boston pizza any day. I had the pizza which was thin and tasty and my husband had the ribs and wing combo which was also very good and portion was huge.\nAnd they have carlsberg on tap!\nExcellent restaurant if you have kids since they have a special kids section that families can sit in.\nI highly recommend checking it out!
