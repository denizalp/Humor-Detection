Gross! Gross! Gross! I wish I could give less than 1 star. I cannot believe the other reviews listed here.\nWe had a group of four and had the all-you-can-eat menu. The sushi was horrible--it didn't taste fresh and seemed hastily prepared! The service was horrible--our waiter couldn't identify what was on the plates he brought, nor could the bar make the drinks we asked for! The atmosphere was horrible!\nAvoid this place like the plague! :-(
