This place opened up late last year and since they offered a Groupon we decided to try them out.  They are an all you can eat Japanese-ish place that uses iPad ordering.  The decor is rather weird for an Asian restaurant of any type with lots of purple and silver and crystals handing from the ceiling, making it look more like a bar or disco than a restaurant.  They were placing rap, hip-hip, and R&B which added to the \"where is the dance floor?\" feel,  We arrived at 8:45pm and they close at 10pm, but the first thing the server said is to make sure and order right away as they would be cutting off service soon.  This was not an auspicious start to the evening and the fact only 2 other people were in there eating raised a red flag.  \n\nA look over the menu showed was not encouraging as the variety was distinctly lacking for this kind of place and they were quite heavy on the Chinese style dishes.  We started with miso soup which was not as good as the instant mix kind I usually buy at the local Asian grocery.  The tempura was probably the best thing they had since that has to be made fresh while most of the other stuff we got was obviously boxed frozen food (coconut shrimp, cheese won-tons, fried scallops, and dumplings especially).  The pork katsu was very thin and very overcooked and probably a frozen cutlet.  The teriyaki was not too bad and the beef skewers were actually pretty good.  The beef fried rice was awful, very dry and desperately in need of salt and the beef was so thinly shaved it reminded my husband of phily cheese steak meat.\n\nThe sushi was mediocre at best and the wasabi was so weak you could eat it straight and still feel no heat.  The sashimi was tiny very thin pieces and they only had 4 kinds of fish.   The nigiri were OK and had a bit more meat on them but the lame wasabi kind of ruined the esperience.  I got a tempura shrimp roll which was OK but no as good as at other places I have eaten.\n\nDessert was supposed to be on a lame salad\/dessert bar but the staff had it cleaned off before 9:30 so all that was left was the ice cream when we were ready to try it.  Even the cookies had been put away!  We did manage to snag the last 2 mango yogurts (more like mango jello)  when we saw them start cleaning it away and they were OK but nothing I would really want again.  The ice cream was awful.  Bad quality green tea, strawberry, mango, and vanilla in 5 gallon tubs.  The taste was off on all 3 we tried (skipped vanilla) and very icy in texture.  (Note:  The salad\/dessert bar photo on Yelp is nothing like what they had this night.  They had maybe 20% of what is shown in that photo.)\n\nBy 9:30 not only had they cleared away the dessert bar, but they started mopping the floors and trying to rush us out the door even though they didn't close until 10pm!  Not a very pleasant dining experience what with being rushed and the poor quality of the food.  We agreed that we will never go back.\n\nOverall, I would say this place has very little chance of staying in business for very long unless they clean up their act.  Maybe they are better if you show up early in the evening, but still the food was not good and so much was obviously frozen food service stuff and I can cook that myself at home for much less than $22 per person.
