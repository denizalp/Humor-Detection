I had lunch here and coffee, of course, which is what I consider the baseline for all um... coffee joints. It was a mixed bag. I hadn't been here since the place was Willow House and was mostly decorated with dirty hippies. I approve of the change. Let's sample the wares, shall we?\n\nOK so first of all, the coffee is weak. Tastes like mom's coffee. Maybe that's your thing, it's not mine. Second, when I am asked if I want \"room for cream,\" and I say \"yes,\" I am not giving you the green light to put in what you figure is an appropriate amount of cream. Seriously did this just happen? Yep, it sure did. Oh, and it was too much freaking cream - shocking, right? Why would anyone do this? People's idea of what the right amount of cream is simply *has* to vary too much for anyone to think this is a good idea. So yeah. Boo.\n\nIt's too bad the place bills itself as a \"coffee house,\" because the sandwich I had (\"Vito's\" - the Italian one) made up for the coffee disaster. WOW. This was a GREAT sandwich. The bread tasted like it came from the Willo bakery down the street if the Willo bakery had ever made bread that was anything approaching edible, which it never has so I don't know why I even said that. The bread was a ciabatta type bread, lush, moist and delicious. The sandwich was overstuffed to the breaking point with meats and cheeses and had a delicious Italian dressing to top it off. The kalamata olives were a nice touch. Voted A+++ - would eat sandwich again!\n\nAll in all, I'd gladly go back. For the food. The coffee? Not so much. Maybe if you're the \"half caf double decaf caf with whipped cream and a shot of Bolivian Espresso\" type the place is like indie Starbucks heaven, I don't know. I'm the coffee type. With a bit of cream, which I am given to understand is actually weirder these days than the half caffers. WHATEVER
