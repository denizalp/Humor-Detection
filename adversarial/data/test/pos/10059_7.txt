I don't get the hype. First off, they don't have AC or at least they're not using it. Now Pittsburgh gets balmy in spring and summer and I like my thai food spicy, AC is crucial. The food is okay, they have some chinese dishes and mediocre thai. The place itself is pretty small and showing wear and age.
