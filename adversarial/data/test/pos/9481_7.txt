I shopped at this Woodman's all through college but now I don't have a lot of patience for this particular location. The set-up is super weird and the endless wood paneling is depressing, but  ultimately we all go to Woodman's for the same reasons: to shop the massive liquor department and score items on the cheap. \n\nI've been to this location a couple times over the past year and I'm always able to find what I want. I'm not a big fan of the produce and deli departments, but for everything else it's a pretty significant savings compared to other chains in the area. I'll still pop in as needed for a quick couple of items, but I'll save my big shops for other locations.
