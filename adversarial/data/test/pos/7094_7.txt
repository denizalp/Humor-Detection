I wasn't as impressed by the look of the other Mexican fare offered here as a whole, but if Nachos is what you crave, then this is the place to come!  And, while it is not prepared or served tableside, the guac dished up here is very good, has a nice slight kick to it, and is served with somewhat unusual homemade White Corn Tortillas.  In fact, the guacamole tasted like it had been stone ground--only in the back of the restaurant. \n\nSpicy Shrimp Nachos were very spicy, which befits their title.  BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos had a nice sweet barbecue sauce clinging to them.  And, Build Your Own Bacon Yellow Queso Nachos were lathered with mild cheese and smokey Applewood Bacon.  But, for me the hit of the night were Supreme Tostada Nachos,  which were really laden with stuff: yellow cheese, tomatoes, ground beef, a few jalapenos, refritos, Green Onions, and salsa.  I barely finished the whole platter.\n\nBut lest you think you can handle more than one platter of nachos here by yourself, I suggest you don't even try.  Besides my platter of Supreme Tostada Nachos, I only sampled the other just described varieties ordered by my fellow diners.  They are all called \"appetizers,\" but that moniker is only appropriate for four sharing souls.  Otherwise, for just one or two hungry diners these massive platters of fried tortilla chips groaning under the weight of piled on cheese and other ingredients are without a doubt main dishes in their own right. \n\nThere were a couple of discordant notes.  The kitchen was all out of Southwestern Soup, and the men's restroom was not properly maintained.  The bathroom floor was dirty, one sink didn't discharge water at all, and no paper towels were left in the dispenser.  Table service was good, and this casual eatery has comfortable seating.\n\nXXX-1\/2 stars overall on this dinner outing!
