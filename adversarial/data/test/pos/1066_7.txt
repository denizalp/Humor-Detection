When I think of the best BBQ I've ever had in my life, Little Miss BBQ comes to mind.  Not only is this the one of the best BBQ joints in AZ, it's one of the best restaurants in AZ, period.  \n\nDon't let the long line scare you away, it's so so so worth the wait!!  They have a water cooler next to the line so you don't dehydrate while waiting.  Even with temps hitting 100+ degrees, I'd wait it out again and again!!  Since moving back from TX, Little Miss BBQ has been on my radar to visit..  My only complaint... I've should of visited sooner!! Man I've been missing out on the best Brisket I've ever had!!! \n\nThe Cole slaw, Jalape√±o chedar grits and potato salad were also on point!!! The slaw and grits were the stand out and will be what I order next visit.  \n\nThat Fatty Brisket doe!!! Wow!! Melts in your mouth!! So flavorful it needs no BBQ sauce, but if you fancy some sauce they keep some delicious flavors stocked on the tables!!  Even though I've only tried the brisket, I can tell whatever you order from this joint is going to be amazing!  No shortcuts, no substitutes, this is the real deal Holyfield!!  \n\nThe seating is limited in the indoor dining area, so don't be afraid to make a new friends and share a table.  \n\nCan't wait to come back!!  My mouth is watering just thinking about that amazing meal!
