11.95 for ONE protein?! Are you crazy, Las Vegas?! \n\nUsually, poke places come with 2 protein MINIMUM and you're letting me choose between one or two proteins? Sure, lets just offer the least amount as possible and charge $$$ because in Vegas that's justifiable right?!\n\nAnother thing is that most poke places offer unlimited toppings, excluding the more expensive ones such as crab meat or avocado. This place offers FOUR toppings only and the toppings are so bizarre that I couldn't even choose 4. Some toppings they offered were corn, broccoli, spinach, etc, like am I at Souplantation or a poke place?!\n\nThe only saving grace here is the yum yum sauce. The poke bowl was good, but definitely experienced better in LA. That being said, the price and limited toppings are both red flags for me so I won't be returning.
