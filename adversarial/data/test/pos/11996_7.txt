I have a serious love\\hate relationship with this place.\n\nI love: \n--The fact that it's open 24 hours. Nothing's worse than needing something late at night, especially medicine, and knowing that the drugstores are closed (they close around here at 10PM--what's up with that?). \n--The fact that they have EVERYTHING. Seriously, you can get your hair cut here, eat lunch at Subway, get groceries, buy clothes, do your banking, fill your prescriptions, etc, and still have a bit of money left to hit up Redbox on your way out. Looking at this place from a \"green\" perspective, this place is quite environmentally friendly bc one only needs to drive to one place to take care of one's errands. I love coming here, getting everything I need, and coming home knowing that I'm in for the night.\n--The fact that the prices are unbelievably low for some items. $0.59 for a 2 liter bottle of pop? Yes please!\n\nI hate:\n--The glacial slowness of the checkot lines. I have seen a wide array of reasons for slowness of lines, ranging from the mundane (someone is waiting for someone else in the store who ran to get the one item they forgot to get), to the annoying (the employee moves at a place that makes a sloth look like a cheetah), to unprecedented (someone took two bottled waters from a 6 pack and attempted to buy them individually), and to the truly sad (someone only had a certain amount of money left on their Ohio Direction Card, and they had to pick and choose items to keep as they were being run up because they didn't have much extra money). Regardless of the reason, it's nearly impossible to count on getting out of here quickly. Picking the right line requires one part skill, one part luck, and one part guesswork. If one could come here and pick the best checkout line to go into every time, I'm sure they could make a killing in Vegas or at the local racetrack. \n--They also tend to run out of items towards the end of the weekend, making the place resemble a grocery store in Communist-era Russia. I've gone there several times and they've been out of various items\n--The behavior of many of the clientele. I know this isn't Brooks Brothers or Williams-Sonoma, but seriously, I have seen folks discipline their child in a manner that makes me seriously concerned that they abuse their child when others are not watching. I have also heard folks curse in a manner that would make the hardest sailor shy away. Aside from that, many of the people here act like they're on a personal shopping visit to the store and leave their carts right in the middle of the aisle and then act offended when one tries to get around them.\n--The vaguely Orwellian \"W-A-L-M-A-R-T\" chant that the employees do in the back within earshot of the sales floor at the start of their shift. I was told that it was intended to build morale and team spirit. I have had employers for whom I would have run through a brick wall because I loved them so much, and I felt this way because they treated me well, paid me a decent wage, and respected me. Maybe Walmart should do that instead...\n\n\nWhen it's all said and done, I go here fairly regularly, and I don't dread going here unless I have to be somewhere urgently.  The money I save is well, well worth the hassle. I just wish the management was a little bit more on top of things with regards to customer service, that's all...if they were, this could be a 5 star place for sure.
