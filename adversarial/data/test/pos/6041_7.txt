Dear Beat, \nYou may be trendy, and you may be in the vicinity of an awesome center for creative space (Emergency Arts), but the hipster staff who take my order are ALWAYS snobby. Please smile and be helpful.\nExcept for  Heather (she's great) and the cute foreign guy; I like watching him slice my tomato.\n\nYour food menu IS great, and though I think your coffee and espresso are not the finest, the ambiance and weekly events DO make up for that a little. I wish I could love you, but I just don't think the connection is there yet.
