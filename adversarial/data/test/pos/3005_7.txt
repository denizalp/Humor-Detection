Right up the place from the dealership I work at so I am surprised I've never tried this place out before now!\n\nGreat service and even better food! What's not to like?\n\nCheese Enchiladas 4\/5\n\nQueso Fundido with Chorizo 5\/5\n\nCarne Asada 5\/5\n\nEverything was good, made well, and pretty quick. We made it in and out on our hour lunch break with enough time to get back to work.
