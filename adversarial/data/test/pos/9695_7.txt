Signing the lease here seemed promising, boy was I wrong. A few months after moving in the air condition broke in the summer on a Friday morning. I called McKenna and they told me \"oh well, you'll have to wait until Monday\". My roommate, her two dogs, my two dogs and myself sat in a house over 100 degrees for almost two days. It only got fixed because I personally had to find an A\/C company with no help of McKenna. We called multiple times about the tile lifting in the upstairs bathroom,they sent multiple people to fix it but no one ever came back to finish the job. At the end of the lease Mckenna sends a piece of mail with a checklist of everything that needs to be cleaned upon move out, everything was done by my roommate and I. They took our whole $1400 deposit to power wash the driveway due to oil stains( they were there when we moved in), Change one light bulb, cleaning, \"adjusting\",not fixing all towel racks( there was nothing wrong with it), cleaning the garage( that was swept out by me personally) and taking out the trash and recycling that was siting at the top of the driveway because they took the garage door clicker, house keys, security gate clicker before the trash man could come.\n\nThere was not one time my roommate or I called that ANYONE in that office was polite or professional and not one employee ever returned a phone call unless they wanted money.\nMcKenna is a joke! They should be ashamed to call themselves a \"management\" company.
