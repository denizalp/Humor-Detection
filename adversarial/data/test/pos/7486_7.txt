Cancel all your credit cards with USAA.  I am a person with a few credit cards.  I got USAA believing that I would be helping the Vets.   Well, my credit was in the thousands.  Then I received a letter saying that my credit was reduced to $300.  I called up and asked why.  They said it was because I WAS NOT....NOT....NOT ....I repeat, NOT USING THE CARD ENOUGH.  So I said, \"I'm offended.  Cancel the card.\"  They said they would only \"close it\" which makes it look like they took the initiative and which would look bad on my credit.  They refused to budge.  So it is nothing short of blackmail.  Use our card or we'll ruin your credit.   Don't get the card if you have not and cancel it if you have it.  You can keep using it if you don't agree with me but you are submitting to nothing short of blackmail.\n\nYou're not helping the Vets when you patronize anything about this company.  You are helping corporate greed.  It takes no leap in logic to figure out that they are not providing much help to the Vets either.  A total SCAM!
