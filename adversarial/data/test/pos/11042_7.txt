Where do i begin?  Well, I had set up the reservation 2 months in advance for our group of 15.  Having read the reviews, I was really looking forward to this meal, as this was one of the main events of our trip.  Now it takes a lot for a steak house to really impress me, but it takes an equally bad experience for me to absolutely regret going....and this was that experience.  \n\nThey were running a little behind when we arrived, so we had a cocktail at the bar.  Every 10 minutes or so, i would check in with the hostess, who perpetually informed me it would be 2 more minutes.  After 40 patient and polite minutes on my end, I finally demanded to speak to the manager.  He could not have cared less about our wait, was quite rude, and made it clear that he didn't have time to speak with me.  Within 10 minutes, they seated us in the 2nd private room upstairs.  It was a nice gesture, but thats where the pleasantness ended.  They had two different sized round tables, which totally ruined our ability to enjoy dinner as a group. We were told there would be bread waiting for us since we were all starving.  LIE.  \n\nIt took 15 minutes for the waiter to get our drink orders.  Then a few minutes later, his assistant came by and asked us for a drinks, we told him that we'd already ordered our drinks, but would like to order some appetizers.  He simply walked away from us.  They then left us for about 25 minutes while they tended to the other private party.  Apparently we were not worth their time.\n\nAfter an hour, we finally received our appetizers, and soon after that, got our dinner.  The steaks were ok.  Whole Foods quality beef at best, and the char on them held the flavor of the fuel(gas??) that cooked the steaks.  The ribeye simply wasn't cooked properly, as the fat was not melted enough, making the mouthfeel terribly unpleasant.  The sides came slowly after the steaks.  The \"family style\" fries were large enough to feed a family of 1.  And they also missed a side as well.  \n\nFor dessert, many of us simply opted for a coffee.  Safe bet for a quick ending, right?  Wrong.  Half of us asked for regular coffee, the other half ordered coffee with liquor.  The regular coffees came up about 10 minutes before the other ones.  When they were brought up, the waiter goes \"who ordered the regular coffee?\"  Our response was simply \"The ones who ordered the regular coffee\".  As the Captain of a Waitstaff of a \"high quality\" steakhouse, how do you not know that?  Thats what you get asked in applebees.\n\nBottom line: The food was not dreadful at best, considering the $2500 tab.  The service was probably the worst i've ever experienced at a restaurant of that caliber.  From start to finish, our experience was one i don't wish on any diner.  Their treatment of us gave the impression that they didn't care because we were Americans.  The sad part is we were all looking forward to this meal.  I don't regret trying the place, but i do regret tipping them at all.  They didn't deserve anything.  There's a difference between having an off night, and simply being bad.  There are plenty of steak houses in Montreal, so if you're gonna spend the money, DON'T GO TO QUEUE DE CHEVAL!
