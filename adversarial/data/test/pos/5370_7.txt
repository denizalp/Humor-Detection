I've been frequenting this bar for over 2 years now. There are a couple main reasons I love it. First and foremost, Kyle. He is by far the BEST bartender I have ever met. He makes each visit fun, and exciting.  It's a chill place to relax with many familiar and friendly faces. \n\nGavin is also great, I usually avoid the evenings when they are not present, at least when it comes to good service. \n\nFood? I love it. Typical bar food items to choose from, but it's all really good. Pizza is amazing too, try the Greek Pizza!\n\nThe trouble I have with Putters is...I try and stop in for  a drink or two and end up staying, and calling a cab! Kyle likes to make different drink creations that are to die for. And if you are a fan of bloody mary's?? You MUST try Kyle's. Delish! \n\nI'm almost embarrassed to admit, but when I made a decision to move back in Nov, I chose my location in part, large part, due to this bar. :) \n\nSo yeah, I like it. Stop in, give it a try. I recommend Tue, Wed, or Thurs nights ;)
