This is a great find.  I have had some take out before and it was always pretty good.  My husband loves this place, so every time he is in the area, he offers to bring some dinner home.  I had a fajita burrito a couple of times.  They travel well.  About a week ago, we were in the area and it was dinner time.  He convinced me to come here.  I am glad, we had a good time.  We ordered steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas so we could sample both.  We also had the chips and salsa.  The food was fresh tasting and very flavorful.  The portions are very generous.  I will definitely come back again.
