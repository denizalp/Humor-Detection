Worst restaurant ever. I came from Cali to visit a friend and she took me here as a prank. I didn't know what a nightmare this so called \"restaurant\" was. She told me this we were going to a quiet place with amazing food. The sarcasm could not be spot on. I could have made anything we ordered in the microwave and the owners yelled the whole time. How is this place in business?
