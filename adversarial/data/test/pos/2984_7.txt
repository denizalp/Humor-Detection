I like this supermarket. It has a large, varied produce section, a good selection of meat (at the counter and wrapped) and seafood. Also, there's a little bbq section. I can usually find everything I need in terms of Asian food here at a decent price, which makes it one of the stores I frequent often when I find myself in Scarborough.\n\nNote, being an Asian grocery store (that isn't owned by Loblaws) cleanliness isn't really a priority here. Also, turning left out of the parking lot is a bitch.
