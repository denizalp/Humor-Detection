This is a great \"hidden\" gem of Toronto! Besides the CN Tower, this is probably the second most popular iconic location of Toronto that you would have to visit! My friends and I walked to this square from Chinatown and it was a great walk because it allowed us to cut through various diverse neighborhoods of the city. Once we got there, we were amazed but the community of people out ice skating (we visited in the winter; in the summer, the rink is a pond of water).\n\nThe Toronto sign was very bright and vivid, but it was hard to take a good picture with so many people around. Definitely try to visit later in the night or early in the morning if you want a nice empty picture with the sign.\n\nThey were blasting music and you can people watch little kids and families and lovers ice skating around the rink. There is also a food vendor in the building next to the rink so make use of that if you're hungry.\n\nA must see if you're visiting!
