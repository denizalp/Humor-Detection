I wish I could give this place no stars. This place deserves it. My bf and I went in to look at a two or three bedroom. Walked in, and after two minutes, was greeted; Not warmly and barely polite and never got her name. Turns out this lady was the manager. She asked what we were looking for and our time frame. Standard questions. Gave us prices and said she could show us the largest two bedroom. Turns out the maintenance had the key. So we had to wait close to 8 min for her to get the key. In the meantime a girl came in that turned out to be a leasing agent, Franci. She ended up being the one to show us the apt. We were on our way. She walked ahead of us and asked us again what our time frame was for moving. No other question was asked the entire 3 minute walk to the vacant. She opened the door and said \"so... Here's the guest bedroom and that's the master...\" That's it. We explored the space, not surprised that this apt was a vast disappointment. It was small. She asked us what we thought. I said it was too small, to which she replied \"Well, this is our largest two bedroom, so.... Yeah\". That's all you have to say?? It gets better. We walk back, and on our way, her phone rings. She pulls it out and silences it without apology. And silence all the way back. I'm pissed at this point. We enter the office and they give me back my license. I politely said we would have to return to see the three bedroom since that apt was too small. She said ok. Upon leaving, the manager was too, so I decided to share our experience. She seemed concerned and apologized. I truly hope she addresses the incompetence of her staff, since she is representing the property and company as a whole. Jupiter Communities would not be pleased with this performance. Prices were great. That's the only thing positive I can say about this community.
