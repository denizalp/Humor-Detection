#43\/2016\n\nTI isn't the worst place to stay but far from the best of moderately priced resort casinos on the Strip.\n\nFirst, registration is a mob scene with too few guest services windows and it's one of the smokiest hotels I've stayed at \n\n(And I've stayed at at least 10 different properties over the years, usually on business). \n\nDespite the griping from Yelpers, the rooms aren't that dated and housekeeping does a *superior job cleaning the rooms and common areas. \n\nThe pool is always populated but the DJ spins lousy music with a heavy rotation of Maroon 5.\n\nThe Coffee Shop has decent breakfast selections and on the other side of the restaurant is Pho that serves its namesake and okay Americanized Cantonese dishes. \n\nIn addition to the elevators taking you around the edges of the casino (if I were playing I'd be annoyed) the doors on the rooms don't have gas hinges so insensitive (or drunk) guests slam doors at all hours of the day and night.\n\nI didn't sleep well the two nights I was there. \n\nYou'll pay the now-common \"resort fee\" ($29) per night to get wifi and use of the pool and gym. \n\nActually, you'll pay regardless so avail yourself.\n\nNot the best but far from the worst and their housekeeping staff gets a big gold star.\n\nTI has an amazing housekeeping staff; let's give 'em a hand and leave them a tip ($5-$10\/day).
