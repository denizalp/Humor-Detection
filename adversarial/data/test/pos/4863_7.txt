Sooo upset ... Went in last night and asked for a very specific pattern and wording for my husbands valentines present ... Needless to say I look like one of those laughable \"nailed it\" pictures on the Internet :( so disappointed \nI should have left as soon as the manager asked the girl if she thought she could do this simple design
