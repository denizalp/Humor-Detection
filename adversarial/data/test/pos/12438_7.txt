We went here for AYCE lunch and I've got to say this place is just OK. The food itself isn't horrible but it's not enjoyable either. The sushi featured very thin slices of fish and was mostly rice. The special rolls weren't all that tasty. I can't think of a single one I'd get again. The maki rolls were decently made but again there's something with the rice that they use that makes it taste blander than other sushi spots.\n\nThere are a few dishes I would definitely avoid ordering though because they're just so bad. The Heart Sushi salad is just iceberg lettuce with shreds of carrots and thin slices of cucumber. There is no dressing at all on it (or maybe they forgot to put it on- I'm not sure). The other dish I'd avoid is the ramen. I suspect the ramen came from an instant noodle package and they tossed some corn, a bit of seaweed and a single shrimp in it and called it a day.\n\nOn the upside, the inside is pretty trendy\/upscale and they use a nifty ipad system that actually works very well since it shows you pictures and descriptions of everything you can order. The servers don't speak english very well so it's a good thing they have the ipads. The prices are a little bit higher than other nearby AYCE yet the place was packed so they must be doing something right.
