I came to Sam's Town bowling alley as part of a school function and didn't partake in any bowling, just the libations. I participated as a spectator though! The alley has plenty of lanes and is clean. It's not the most updated bowling alley in Vegas but it's close to the Strip. The bar has a few interesting beers on tap and it's only $9 for a pitcher. A cup of beer will set you back $4. Cheap drinks on a Saturday night? Me likey.\n\nOne thing that was a bit weird was that bowlers had to hand over one shoe to trade for a pair of bowling shoes as a security deposit. Is that a thing?\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #72
