My boyfriend and I were told to try the pizza at this place from a regular customer who swears by their Neapolitan style pizzas.  Unfortunately we visited late on a weekday (9:15pm) and their kitchen was already closed, so they offered us takeout. They later changed their mind and was kind enough to accommodate us for pizza - which is what we came in for which was awesome!\n\nBeniamino who served us was so kind and welcoming.\n\nThe place had a contemporary feel. A group of older Italian men socializing in the corner having their espressos and digestivos which reassured me that this place was legit LOL.\n\nWe both ordered Margherita pizzas. I like to try the basic pizzas for a joint I am trying for the first time to really taste their quality in ingredients. I requested mine to be spicy (option not offered on the menu) and they were happy to do so.\n\nThey pizzas really hit the spot of my 2 week craving of true Italian pizza. The pizzas were light, simple and flavorful. We finished off with some good limoncello mmm. \n\nFYI majority of the cooks are from Napoli! ;)
