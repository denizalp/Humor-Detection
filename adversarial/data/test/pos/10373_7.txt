Had I left a review after our first stay here\n(seven nights) it would have been 3.5-4* despite obviously being a motel converted to the Hyatt Place brand. The suites have a modern decor, two large flat screens (one in living area, one in bedroom) a refrigerator, working area, desk, large bedroom, small bathroom with no tub. The suites were clean, and housekeeping was efficient. \n\nThey have premade salads, baked goods and sandwiches with KCal information you can purchase at front desk. Breakfast is complimentary and lackluster; gym is seriously lacking. Conveniently located by Chandler Fashion Center, multiple dining options and the freeway. Most of the front desk staff were aloof, no smiles, no greetings, odd. Every afternoon there was a very loud (with DJ) 'pool party' till 10PM, calls to the front desk were futile, except to say they end at 10. \n\nOn our second stay, the check in clerk was downright snotty; a young blonde with a PermaScowlâ„¢ I have since renamed Large Marge (LM) Whatever, I thought LM might be having a bad day. Wrong! I became ill while we were there, causing us to extend our four night stay by one night so I could rest after seeing the Doctor. PIC went out to pick up a script for me AFTER arranging and paying for another night (the PAID receipt was slipped under the door) \n\nWhat happened next was the single craziest thing I've ever witnessed in a hotel...Right after check-out time, LM was pounding on door telling me that I had to leave; I produced the receipt and bid her good day, going back to bed. Shortly thereafter, the Manager and LM were banging on the door, again saying we had not paid for an extended stay: again I produced the receipt, and advised that I was ill, and my husband would talk to them in a few minutes when he returned from the pharmacy.\n\nWhen he did return and tried to sort it out with the front desk, they were so rude, and he was so upset at the exchange and how they had treated me that he wanted to leave immediately. We hurriedly packed our things; unfortunately, in haste, I left behind my Iphone charger, sunglasses, and a beloved irreplaceable stuffed animal I've had since I was two. They claim not to have found them: color me not-at-all surprised; a stuffed dog that survived trips to three dozen countries spanning five continents over forty+ years, including some of the largest disaster responses in US history could not withstand the wrath of LM. \n\nWe disputed the final night's charge (which had indeed gone through) with our credit card, called and wrote to Hyatt Corporate, which resulted in a reversal of charges from MC and offer for a three night's stay in a property of our choosing in the future from Hyatt Corp. \n\nWhile we are very happy Hyatt Gold Passport members, staying in all tiers of their properties, we would neither stay here again nor suggest it to anyone. No hospitality, and insane behavior from \"Management.\" Never in my life have I experienced this type of behavior from a hotel, including sketchy ones I've stayed in overseas or stateside when deployed to disasters by the American Red Cross.\n\n* non smoking property * \n\n** small outdoor pool and hot tub **\n\n*** unreliable Wifi ***\n\n**** pet friendly ****\n\n***** I want Snoopy back :( ***** \n\n\nTl;dr \n***** Beware LM! *****\nPrepare for attempted eviction from your prepaid room by an unstable, surly front desk clerk, and a complete disregard for your possessions.
