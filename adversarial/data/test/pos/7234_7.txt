Vegas is over-priced for it's artificial fanciness and being from LA, I'm done with the gimmicky steak places.  But WOWers place was unexpectedly great!  \n\nWe got what everybody gets, the tomahawk ribeye (med rare) with lobster tail (ritz mush was grainy but I don't think you're suppose to really eat it eat it), Caesar salad and mac and cheese.  There was barely any room thanks to their large plates, but everything was delicious!  I would definitely come here again next time.  Nice dinner without a huge financial burden.\n\nThe only odd thing was I asked for tobasco and they gave me those tiny hotel\/airplane bottles in a dish.  None of them were wrapped\/sealed and had various levels.  I really think there is someone in the back knee deep in tiny empty tobasco bottles refilling them with a huge $1.99 tobasco bottle.  They must have a really small funnel and the patience of a leprechaun.  Classy!
