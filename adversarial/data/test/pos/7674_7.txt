I'll keep this review relatively short as I solely had lunch.\n\nInteresting choice of decor in the inside, but spacious enough for a private lunch or date. You're usually seated right away during the lunch time rush and I found that a pleasant surprise for the size of the restaurant. I came specifically for the Pad Thai (for reasons more explained below) and once my order was placed, we were served a bowl of tofu soup for an appetizer. I'm not sure if it was part of the meal or a kind gesture, but nothing special. \n\nThe food was delivered at a good pace for my lunch break timing. Decent portion sizes and it was like any other Pad Thai that I've had. Nothing spectacular to entice your tastebuds. Don't expect to be immersed in the streets of Bangkok either. Simply put, it lacks flavor. No crushed coriander, hardly any bean sprouts or red chili peppers to be found. Plenty of scallions and peanuts though. What surprised me the most was the missing hint of lime and fish sauce. Standard rice noodles thrown into the mix too. \n\nTraditional staple dishes, such as Pad Thai or even Pad See Ew, are simple to cook and shouldn't be cheated of their traditional flavors. If simple dishes such as these are missing their essentials, what else do the cooks \"forget\" to add to the other dishes? I understand that it's offered as a lunch portion and it's relatively light on the pocket, but really? Noodles are cheap and it's easy to make a portion look larger than it is. But is it difficult to reduce the amount of noodles, throw in a little more seasoning and vegetables and still offer it at a decent price? I don't think so as do the other competitors in the area. \n\n*Service is excellent though.
