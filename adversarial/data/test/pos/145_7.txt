Well I hate to be the first one to write a bad review, but with how much they wanted for repairs on my truck was ridiculous. I went to Howies based on the reviews on Yelp. I told them what I thought was wrong with my truck, but I did this to see if they would go along with it. Next thing I knew they agreed with what I said and gave me a labor quote for $1200, but 2\/3 of the repairs they quoted weren't needed at all; those were the $$$ ones.  So I took my business elsewhere and had my truck good as new for $175 in labor.
