Woah, from 5 stars, to 4, down to 3 stars, not a good direction to be going Uber Boober!\n\nI tried to see what it would cost my parents and their friends to use Uber from the Vegas airport to the strip hotel. I searched a month out, which is as far is it would let me.\n\nWhat was the response? That Uber is not available in that area at that time!!??! It does not give me other times either. What? Pardon? Excuse me? How is that possible??? There are entire forums that discuss using Uber from the airport to the strip and up and down the strip. It's mostly drivers complaining about the lack of money their making, but clearly Uber is in fact in Vegas and certainly at the airport. \n\nAnd of course, no customer service to ask about it. Bad Uber Goober, very bad!\n\nP.S. Sorry for the name calling, I am very perturbed right now.
