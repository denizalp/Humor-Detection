Why the hell did they put IMAX here?\n\nArizona Mills has vastly decreased in integrity over lets say the past 3 years (ever since Krispy Kreme Doughnuts took a turn for the worse), many of the stores have left and been replaced by generic stores such as the one that sells multiple versions of doctors\/nurses scrubs.\n\n\nNow with the departure of the Virgin Megastore this mall is officially dead to me.\n\nedit: Don't bring your 30k+ car to this mall, it will get stolen or end up with a barrage of door dings. You can thank the non-existent security.
