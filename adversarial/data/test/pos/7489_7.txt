I grabbed J.Lo's ass, married Clooney, met B. Franklin, G. Washington, got into bed with Hugh Hefner and stared into Brad Pitt's pretty eyes.  Oh, and my cousin got her neck bitten by Siegfried and Roy's tiger.\n\nAwesome.  I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it, but it was a blast-bring your camera, your lidded drink and have a good time!
