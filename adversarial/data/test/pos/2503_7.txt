Southwest offered the cheapest airfare at the time for a round trip from LA to Phoenix. I love that the checked in bag was free, and I don't have to spend an additional $50 round trip. \n\nBoarding is organized since you line up by group and number. Picking our own seats was great. On other flights, I have to negotiate to sit with someone I knew. They also offered free pretzels and peanuts. I don't remember the last time I was offered a free snack. Wi-fi is available for $5. \n \nI will be definitely choose Southwest again especially if there is a good price.
