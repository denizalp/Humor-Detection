Money hungry, desperate tow company that sneaks around residential areas after 1 am putting violation stickers on vehicles and towing them right in front of homes. I woke up with a registration violation sticker on my car and I have valid, current registration. They need to find real work and stop harassing hard working citizens at their homes.
