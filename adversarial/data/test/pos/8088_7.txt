You are in for a treat once you enter and see the gorgeous lake view! \n\nWalked in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon without reservation and we were seated right away! It wasn't that busy probably coz it's the Saturday before Easter. \n\nMultiple menu choices and also vegetarian and vegan friendly. Great lunch options.. tried the chef's special pasta, spaghetti and mushrooms with Alfredo sauce, nicely done lacked some salt but overall nice. Tomato soup with grilled cheese was served perfectly hot and was so yummy. Hubby tried the flat iron steak which was the best dish of all. My son tried the hot brown sandwich with jalape√±o bacon served with crispy fries, one of the best fries! \n\nWe were so full, didn't get to try dessert. However I plan to return very soon to try the 3 course weekly Harvest menu with bottomless wine :)\n\nOur server Rick was excellent and so was the rest of the staff who made sure we had plenty of bread and water. \n\nMake sure you use the free glass of house wine with entree purchase upon yelp check in!
