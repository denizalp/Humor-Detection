I need to start with the fact that we are normal people, not hipsters, and not scottsdale brats. That being said, we are very impressed with this place. Walking into a trendy new business and seeing their dress code on the door is perfect, I  appreciate the business setting the tone from the start. The music is perfect, the ambiance  is dark and elegant and everything about the place is enjoyable. This place is what Bitter & Twisted aspires to be. Good on you Honor Amongst Thieves.
