I have a new construction home, only the front yard is currently landscaped with only several shrubs.  \n\nI was quoted $150 to trim the shrubs and blow out leaves, etc.  Ridiculous price.\n\nWithout my authorization they came the next week and cleaned the yard.  I was not at home so one of the workers came by the following week to collect  $180. Damn near criminal extortion.  \n\nAvoid this company.  Very unscrupulous. For comparison I now have the yard being maintained for $15.
