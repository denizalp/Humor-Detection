The bf holds relatively deep resentment for this club for trying to guide a blacked-out me down 4 narrow flights of stairs.\n\nI thought I remembered my entire night at Hakkasan, until I realized there was a huge lapse in my memory (and not enough pictures taken)... I guess 3 LC's will do that to you -.-\n\nHits:\n* Cool, beautiful crowd... From what I remember\n* Great staff -- had a heart-to-heart with the security guard manning the entrance line while waiting for my promoter\n* Spacious restaurant\/club with 5 floors -- 3 dedicated to the nightclub: Hip Hop room at floor #3, EDM room floors #4 - 5\n* Don't remember this part, but I heard the CO2 effects made the lasers look really cool and blew down directly on the crowd... glad I didn't pass out from it\n* Decent drink prices for Vegas nightclubs -- $16 for LC's is much better than EBC's $23 vodka red bulls\n* Instant entrance for those with pre-sale tickets -- the boys waited a good 15 minutes for us while we were getting the promoter situation straightened out\n\nLessons Learned:\n* Dance floor too small and the club had too many tables, with too much dead space between the tables -- guess the club is designed to promote booking tables... wish we had $8k to shell out for a table on the dance floor\n* No sitting or leaning against the railing! Unless you wanna get yelled at by security \n* There are a million stairs -- wear sexy, but comfy shoes \/ heels\n\nI'll have to come back to consciously experience this club again.
