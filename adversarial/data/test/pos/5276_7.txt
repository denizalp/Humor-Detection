Three star is a fair assessment for this Buffet.\n\n$21 per person for lunch.\n\nYou can buy meal ticket with credit cards at the Kiosks at the entrance and skip the line of cash payment.\n\nA wide range of selections: seafood, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, fruits and salad bar, breakfast items, bakery and desserts...\n\nI like buffet because there's something for everyone.  And my favorite must-haves are: lox, shrimp cocktail, and cheesecakes.  This one had all.  However, lox and shrimp cocktail were a bit chewy, so were some of the meats.  The desserts were great though.\n\nDecent services.  Drinks came right away.  Dirty plates were taken away fast.\n\nI would probably come back on a very hungry morning, when the line of waiting is not unbearable.
