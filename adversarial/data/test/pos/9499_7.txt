My bf actually took me there for my birthday... the food was okay, so for the over priced amount that they were charging.... NOT WORTH IT! And the SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE... instead of them singing that happy bithday song for me with the desert... they sang to the next table as we were eating our appetizer. The girl at the table was so confused. The girl, her boyfriend and the staff were asking around for my name. And to top it off, they actually took the time to check which table and they announced that it was suppose to be for me... thanks for the embarrassing experience and NO I would not like my desert now... I told the couple they can have that desert. My bf was fuming... that I had to calm him down!!! For spending $300 and be embarrassed like that... NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They actually deserve a NEGATIVE 5 STARS.
