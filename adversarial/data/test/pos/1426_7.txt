As usual, the lying cow on my GPS insisted I was at my destination and I was not.  Thanks to perseverance and a female's uncanny ability to read maps (ha!), I was able to find this great little spot.  (thank you Yelp photos!)\n\nDark wood, low lighting, lots of British items (including Union Jack ties on the wait staff) - this was right up my alley.  And speaking of alley, that is where you enter - not under the signage.  My waitress was friendly and helpful, though I am low maintenance, so I am pretty easy to please as long as you remember I am sitting there.  At an early 6:00 on a Wednesday night before a holiday (July 4th), the crowd was sparse for dining, though the bar seemed to have a pretty lively bunch.  They had some $4 pint specials (I believe it was Guiness, though I don't drink so I wasn't paying attention).  Also, Wednesday has half price appetizers.  \n\nThe food:\nCottage pie ($12):  Ground beef, peas, carrots and onions in a beefy gravy, covered with mashed potatoes and topped with melted cheese.  Very well flavored and not overly salty.  It is hard to do a cottage pie to my liking and this was delicious.  Though unevenly heated, some spots were molten hot and others were room temp, it was a very good dish that I would definitely order again.  \nBubble and squeak ($4) - A pan seared mashed potato cake with cabbage in it.  I like colcannon from the Irish, so I was hoping this was kind of like that.  Alas, it was a mashed potato cake with a little cabbage in it.  It was kind of salty to me.  But, different.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I did however eat every bit like I wasn't going to get food ever again because I like white food groups with a pan sear on them.  \n\nOn the far right side of Atherton Mill, there was plenty of parking, even directly in front of the pub.  If you are heading towards uptown and exit the parking lot on the same side that Big Ben's is on, you can catch a stop light to get back onto South Blvd rather than trying to cross all of the traffic.\n\nWonderful little spot, I shall return!  (the food is better than the pictures I have posted would have you believe - I try to not use my flash inside of restaurants, as to not disturb other people with the weird fat girl taking pictures of her food, and this is a dark bar, so the pictures were bleh).
