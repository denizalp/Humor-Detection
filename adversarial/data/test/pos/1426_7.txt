Be aware that when you order their signature Carne Asada Fries, you should be VERY hungry. Even though it's really good - lots of well-seasoned meat, guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese on top of a generous serving of fries - you will probably  not be able to finish it. The serving is that humongous; it can feed three people. This small eatery offers lots of combinations and items at low prices. Definitely no fancy atmosphere, but lots of choices and generous servings of good food at low prices make this place a winner,
