SAM IS THE MAN!!! I have purchased numerous sets of tires from him and I can honestly say I have NEVER been disappointed. I have never seen a tire shop that has a waiting room with toys for little kids, I bet its never used but it shows you how considerate and thoughtful a person can be. Hes thinking about everyone and is trying to keep everyone happy even if it means they might walk into his shop once a year. I asked him to find me a set of tires but I wasn't in a rush cause it was winter and I wanted it for my summer wheels,they were a very rare size but he found the tires for me and got them to his shop, I told him I would go by to have them installed but I kept procrastinating, one day he had a customer for the same tires but even though I didn't have any sort of deposit and I kept breaking my word he still gave me the benefit of the doubt and called me before trying to sell them. He was a man of his word and I respect that. Obviously you cant expect him to do that for every other person that walks in but he definitely takes care of his returning customers.
