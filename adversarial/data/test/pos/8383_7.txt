The staff might be great if you have the time and ability to drive to the store in hopes that they have what you are looking for.  Just don't hope to actually talk to someone and get a question answered - the store will not provide any information on its stock via the phone. So if you are looking to figure out if they have a product before you go, you will have a very frustrating conversation in which someone standing in the store will not tell you whether they do or do not have something they might be standing right next to. It was an awful customer service experience and made me buy a competing product instead. Microsoft certainly isn't going to improve its reputation this way!
