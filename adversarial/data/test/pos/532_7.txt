First time at this place and it's gonna be my last. \nLet me warn you it's not the most comfortable restaurant to sit in. Very tight, loud but I guess that goes hand in hand at some places.  The portions are very small but tasty and as for service which was terrible starting from the cold persona hostess to our inconsiderate waitress that hardly came around to check on us. She took my arugula carpaccio plate away and didn't ask if I was done and then I asked for another order of bread and took forever to come between courses. When it finally came she made a point to tell me that it was going to be added to my bill.  Wow! Thanks for the info. Finally I had to go up to her and the hostess and ask them to take our coffee orders. She said I quote \"espresso\" I replied please come to our table and ask each person what they'd like. I felt like I was her manager training her. Trust me she would be fired and working at Denny's.
