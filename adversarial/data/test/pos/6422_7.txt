It stinks of cigarette smoke from the second you walk in the door and it's a dump. An utter dump, crawling with lowlifes all hours of the day. I felt like I was at a gang convention; I was the only one not covered head to toe in tattoos.\n\nLike another reviewer said already, the place is just downright SEEDY.\n\nThere's trash here and there on the floors in the public areas, the whole place is a relic from the 60s and 70s, complete with photos of Dean Martin and that scene from an era when, gee, people seemed to dress up, even in black tie.  Ha, you're lucky if they wear a shirt now.\n\nThe lines are laughable at the front desk.  Any time of day or night too! Wee hours of the morning -- wanna check out? Ha, be prepared for a long wait just to check out (easier to just walk out, never look back).  Arriving at 5pm some evening? Ha, be prepared to spend an hour just waiting to REGISTER in the hotel!  The self-serve registration\/checkout kiosk machines are usually BROKEN.  \n\nWhen I was there, one of the hotel elevators was broken, door open at lobby level, all buttons for all floors lit inside; all day people would stream in, discover the problem, and walk out annoyed.  Did the hotel do anything? Hell no.  Not for the first 12 hours anyway.\n\nThe hotel room was OK.  Except for the lights and the noise.  Noise from a) the fricking pool right outside the window (they put me on level 46, meaning 6th floor) and b) the noise from the drunken guests, pretty bad until about midnight-1am.  And the lights from the pool area, and huge floodlights aimed at the tower and right under my window, kept the place nice and bright at night.\n\nOh man, this place is such a dive. I will never, ever go back there.  I detest Vegas. The whole place oughta be nuked from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
