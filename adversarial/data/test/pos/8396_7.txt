I had a Great time at the AZ Taco Festival. I mean like Tony the f*cking Tiger Grrrrreat. I may have just been so impressed because the most recent festival I attended was such a dud that it made this one look exponentially better.\n\nWe got here early which I think also helped. The parking was smooth and Free. There were no crowds to fight. It was awesome. \n\nThe token system used to purchase food and drinks also made everything run smoother than if people were trying to pay by other means at each individual taco booth. Very efficient.\n\nMy favorite taco was made by the Tonto Bar & Grill. It was a grass fed bison taco with chile jicama slaw and tepary salsa. Very good.\n\nMonti's Steakhouse made a good beef taco, but what I liked most was their corn tusk taco basket. That was pretty cool. \n\nThere was also a unique dessert taco made by Gertrudes. Unfortunately I didn't take a pic... The taco shell was a chocolate (I think) waffle cone. Inside was avocado ice cream and something else... ugh I wish I took a pic. Memory Fail. It was definitely tops for uniqueness though.\n\nI'm right there with Travis B in noticing the lack of veggie taco options. There should have been a few more. They're not necessarily my thing, but if I was a vegetarian, I would have been disappointed. \n\nWe didn't hang around for much of the entertainment. It was mostly just a taco devouring expedition. And in that respect the AZ Taco Fest was a complete success.
