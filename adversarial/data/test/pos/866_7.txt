SMH........... I don't understand why TAO is so hyped up. Yeah I got in quick.. yeah the decor is nice... yeah there are girls with just flowers on their nips in tubs filled with rose pedals.. but seriously?? Place is big, yes it is.. okay music.. but table areas were small. The one thing I really hated at TAO was the bouncers... wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.... I can't say it enough... they are super DOUCHE like.. just this one African American woman that covered the upper level that night. She was just something else.... SMHHHHHHHHHHH...
