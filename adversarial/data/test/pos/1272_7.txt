I had a very uncomfortable experience here yesterday.  Most occurred while getting searched upon entering. My belongings were all searched extensively in an inappropriate way.  The person doing the search removed and examined all items in my bag, even going through my wallet and all of my credit cards- forcing me to even throw out my banana.\nThe worst was my medicine. My name is on the bottles and I was told that I could not bring them inside. It was embarrassing to put the medicines out for everyone to see.  Apparently if I was in the normal and not the expedited line I would have been allowed to bring them in? \nI understand the need for more security in these venues but there has to be a consistent non-harassing way of doing it.\nSave your money and time waiting to get into this place and go elsewhere. DJ doesn't even come on until 330 and it sounded like a Spotify playlist
