Nell, our salesperson was excellent, along with everyone that helps in the shoe department.  One lady in cosmetics was rude & more concerned w\/ putting her own make-up on.  She was even dressed like as customer, but obviously wasn't went I asked for help.  Didn't get her name, but she was from NY, black long hair.  \n\nI had $15 off $40 & a 25% off coupon, $200 gift card.  The coupons only work w\/ gift cards or Macy's Credit cards, which the earlier lady didn't explain.  However, Nell in the Free People area did.  Also when you donate $3 to the Military charity you get 25% off... select brands is the catch.  None of these coupons worked with Free People, only discounted items, not original prices of certain brands.  Very confusing.  \n\nOverall, I do think that we have the best, cleanest, even the restrooms & a wonderful selections of clothing, shoes & make-up, than any other Macy's.
