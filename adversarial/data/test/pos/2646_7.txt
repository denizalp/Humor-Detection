Not only am I looking forward to my DESERT DOUBLE DOWN medal in 2013 :) but I get to see my dear friend in Arizona over MLK weekend and experience this race for the first time, I can't wait! Only running the half this go around since I plan on racing a bunch this coming year, and need to pick and choose wisely how often I will complete full's - looking forward to having an amazing time!\n\nI'll update my review in a few weeks after Race Day.
