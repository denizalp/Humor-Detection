Wow. Where do I start... The legally blonde bartenders should go into data entry positions in boiler room operations because they have business dealing with the general population. They have a sense of entitlement due to dealing with their legions of local regulars who put up with their attitudes and snake like dispositions.\n\nI got eye rolls from both bartenders after asking them to perform their job duties. One passed my buddy by and I motioned her he needed assistance. She flipped out, saying I hate when ppl say their friend needs something. Dont pass up by then!!! I apologized four times she persistently kept arguing. GFY! I asked another for ketchup for my fries, another eye roll. Really?! Shitty tip well deserved. Steer clear of this place. My buddy knows the owner, real cool. Get new staff.
