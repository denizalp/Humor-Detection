One of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas. \nI can eat here in the morning for breakfast and feel like a champ. \nI can eat here for lunch and feel fantastic. \nI can eat here for dinner and feel like a winner. \n\nBut of course, I wouldn't do that!! Too much yummy foods!! \nMy favorite meals of the day here is breakfast and late night. \n\nI'm not a big fan of cheesecake factory, but why do I love their sister restaurant oh so much?
