Car selection at 4:00 PM was a little out of the norm.  I had a certificate for a free rental day, and had to go to the Customer Service booth outside in the parking lot to have the rental contract adjusted. However, once that was done, I had a choice of cars - pretty decent selection for $23 per day.\n\nCar return at around midnight was great.  Took less than a minute and was quick and painless!!
