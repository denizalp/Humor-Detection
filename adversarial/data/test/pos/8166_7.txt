This location is just off Yonge. It's more of a warehouse than a store. I looked at a few items on their website but when I went to pick them up, the staff were totally useless. They were too busy unpacking boxes. Once I changed my mind on buying some heavy duty mats for my home gym (totaling $150 for a very small area), the employee gave me a lot of attitude. \n\nTheir equipment is far better in quality than what you'd find elsewhere (e.g. Walmart) and so do expect to pay considerably more. \n\nMy suggestion is to try their other locations for better advice and choices.
