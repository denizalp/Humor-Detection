I think Cold Stone is overrated. The ice cream melts way to fast and gets all soupy, the Cold Stone employees never mix the ingredients very well and I always walk away thinking, \"...really? Did I just do that to myself again?\" \n\nThis location in particular is never clean, the bathrooms are a bit scary and they don't sing when you tip them. If you're in the area and you're looking for a cold treat skip on over to Fatburger (just next door) and get their chocolate shake!
