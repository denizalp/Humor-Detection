Oh no no no !!!  never going there Ahh! or any Waffle House.....  I went with my wife to try it out , it looked if we went back to the 50's . The kitchen was so dirty, only two people working there the Cook and the Waitress. I order the Waffle , it took 20 minutes to be done, while waiting in the back room the waitress was smoking where all the food is stored.. I was like wait a minute, the cook called her for my waffle , then she tells me is the waffle brown enough touching it with her hands ...  this is a Twilight Zone Moment ... sorry , but never and ever stepping in a Wackala House !!!
