Less of a show and more of a cool thing to do while you drink at your table and eat dinner in the other room..at least that's the idea. But most people will agree with me that a ticket at that price should be more like show. I think their \"social experiment\" was kind of a failure here.\n\nAnd by the way, there's a restaurant connected to it. I know, weird. I kind of don't get it. I mean, I get what they were trying to do...but I think the concept is a failure.\n\nStrongly preferred Absynthe (same producer) over this. We LOVED that show. Probably one of our favorites. Mixed in raunchy comedy with Vegas-style acrobatics.\n\nI mostly didn't like the magic acts. You can always figure out how it was done, and I hate that.\n\nSome nudity; my husband appreciated that! Haha. But nothing crazy. I do know that the show at midnight is only half an hour, significantly cheaper, and way more X-rated.\n\nWith all that said, if you're staying at the Cosmo, it is a cool thing to do.
