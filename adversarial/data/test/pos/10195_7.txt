My garage door would get stuck while opening. I called these guys and they were able to help diagnose the problem over the phone (along with a quote if I wanted them to do it). I was able to find the problem with their help and ended up replacing my screw drive carriage myself because the threads had worn off.\n\nI still had them come out because the garage had never been serviced. Tim, the repair technician, explained to me the cause of the carriage failure was my springs. My garage door was very heavy and difficult to lift while in manual mode and this put strain on the carriage and opener. The springs, rollers, and some bearings were replaced and Tim pointed out the issues\/concerns as he worked. It made me feel comfortable that I was making the right decisions when choosing what to have done. Tim also waived a couple of the fees. Awesome! And my garage door is a lot quieter when opening and closing now, too.\n\nThis company is also great because they send an email reminder of your appointment. They also call when they are on there way and provide an estimate on when they will be there.\n\nThe next time I need some garage door service I will be calling these guys again.
