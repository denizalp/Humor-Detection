Wouldn't you think Caesar's Palace could serve a decent Caesar's Salad? I mean c'mon, a lousy Caesar's Salad. So have you ever noticed how embarrassed the other casino hotels are about having food courts for the proletariat? When you go to, like, the Venetian, it's hidden away on a second floor. At the Bellagio, you barely notice it. Give Caesar's credit that they put theirs front and center in the casino right near the Colosseum's main entrance doors. \n\nHell, I didn't even know the place had a name, but this is where Jamie W. sat as the non-gambling porkers we are and ate a quickie meal before both Cher and Bette Midler. Now I never find anything all that appetizing among the international chain of kiosks, but before Bette, I decided to try the Shrimp Caesar's Salad at one of them. It came in the standard plastic bowl with the standard plastic mini-cup of dressing. I actually don't remember much about it, but I can always count on the older Asian woman in the country kitchen outfit handing out toothpicks and busing tables. OK, that's all I got. \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...Caesar's hath no Caesar's salad worthy of the palace \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's a food court with faux-Roman statues...what d'ya expect? \nSERVICE - 2 stars...snail-like despite the throngs \nTOTAL - 2 stars...serves its purpose for pre-Cher and pre-Bette idle time...what can I say?...after spending do-re-mi on the shows, we're cheap!
