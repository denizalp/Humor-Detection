We went to this place when it was mostly empty, so I was concerned. But the beer selection was pretty good, local craft and other interesting and solid choices. 15 in all. The waitress got a kick out of the appetizer that involved balls, but it was really just mashed potatoes in fried balls. Nothing to get excited about.\n\nThey have this giant bacon burger with bacon in and on top of the burger patty. It has a fried egg on it as well. It was the bomb. It was huge, like a child's head.\n\nStaff seems pretty fun, a little weird but that's OK. I'm weird too. The prices were a little high, with three of us spending close to $90 on three meals, one appetizer, and a few drinks. To be fair though, we went with entr√©es and not the lunch specials. Those were six dollars I think.
