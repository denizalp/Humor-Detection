I finally tried my first food truck in Vegas!  After hopping around food carts in Portland for half a week, this was still on the brain.  I knew Fukuburger would be near where I was, so I made the trip over and told them I was a first timer :)  I got the karai (spicy) with \"extra spicy\" and mentioned I am a Texan.  I also gave a lil YEEHAW!  So when my burger was ready, they called out YEEHAW!!!!  Strawberry lemonade was soooo good.  I am not usually one to order sweet drinks, but I enjoyed this a lot, savoring it til I got home after a 15 min drive.\n\nThe burger itself was tasty, a nice size.  Loved the fresh cucumbers, and it had a zing, but I never found or tasted the avocado.  The guy behind me had just arrived in moving truck to Vegas from my hometown Houston, so we started chatting.  He ordered the tamago burger, my next choice when I get to Fukuburger again, and scarfed it down and his side of fries faster than me.  It is probably because I talked more than I ate though.  I tend to do that!  \n\nAnyway, the guy taking orders overheard me say I Yelped to my new line-friend, and said Yelpers are hard to please.  I told him if he had napkins, then I am easy to please.  Anyway, they had some special burgers for $1 more to check out too.\n\n*Note: While I came prepared with cash, they surprisingly take credit cards.  The people who did pay that way got called out though - they yell CREDIT CARD!!!!! when the request to pay that way is made :)
