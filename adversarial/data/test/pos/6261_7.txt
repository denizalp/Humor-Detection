Located on the Linq Promenade, you'll want to set the expectation that this is mainly a takeout spot.  But who wants takeout this deep into the Strip?  It's not like you can park out front and walk in and out.  Unless you have somewhere close by to take it, it will be cold by the time you get there.  So that brings up the issue of eating on the spot.  Yes there are tables and counters inside and an outside patio.  \n\nHere is where it gets tricky.  Because this place is located in such a pedestrian packed area, there is almost always a line to the door of customers.  Even if it isn't a long line, you'll notice a ritual when you walk in the London phone booth looking front door.\n\nAs you walk in, there are tables right there in front of you and to the sides.  There is also a counter to the left with high bar stools.  For the most part all of these will be occupied.  The ritual comes into play where you will notice people hovering like honey bees to a flower over other people as they eat or more so when it seems like someone is close to finishing.  The hovering bees are people who have already ordered and may or may not have picked up their food yet.  They are waiting for a place to open up so they can stake their claim and sit.  \n\nThe bees from different hives will eye each other and display slight signs of faux dominance over their potential flower while nonverbally communicating \"I claimed this spot first.\"\n\nThere's usually a polite exchange between the people leaving and the people claiming to say \"I'm finished you can have this spot\" and \"thanks, now pick up your camera and tourist stuff and get to step'n!\"\n\nSo, you were a good worker bee and now you have a place to call your own and enjoy your meal.  The fish & chips are nicely done.  The fish batter is light and crispy. Cod of course has none of that wild fishy taste so it's always a staple for this type of food.  The fries are tasty and they have seasoned fry choices if you like (but it will cost you).  They also have several options for dipping sauce if you like and this comes with the meal. \n\nThe fish portion sizes are on the small side and might not be a good value to some for the price you end up paying. Expect your plate with fountain drink to be in the $15-16 range.  They have some flavored lemonades if you want to pay extra. Don't want the fish, you can try the shrimp. \n\nOverall the place is well done and would be a better experience in another less dense location. \n\nAbout that bee: an industrious worker bee may visit 2,000 flowers per day.
