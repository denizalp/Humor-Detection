I agree with other users comments. To sum it up like another patron said, LAME. Definitely not a place you'd like to bring a friend. Food was tasteless and not hot. Was banned from the place for life and had the authorities called on me since I was mingling with another table. Before I sat down at the table I asked if it was okay for me to join. They said it was fine, and had no problem. The owner knew me since I made it a point to introduce myself to him whenever I first came there since I am heavily involved with the restaurant industry and was curious to see who was involved with the concept. This was the third time I was visiting. As I was talking with the table the owner rudely interrupted, and asked to speak with me. I followed him away from the table to the bar and he said I couldn't sit there. He than left me at the bar by myself. I requested a drink and was denied service. A \"bouncer\" came up to me and threatened me as he pushed me out the door. The \"director of operations\" called the cops on me as I called 911 on them for harassment and walked away. Five cop cars showed up, and they thought it was a joke, since they were aware I did nothing wrong. The \"director of operations\" was in the cop car and said I was banned. What she didn't know is I didn't plan on going to that dry place again anyways with mediocre food and terrible service. I live right next door to it and know a lot of people in the area. Soo not only will you lose my service, but I will spread the word. Way to make your new establishment known in the area. Mark my words, we will watch you fail
