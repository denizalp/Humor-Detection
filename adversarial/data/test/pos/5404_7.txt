Taking advantage of two visitors and a pair of holiday weekends to revisit several of 2017's best meals it was as a party of five that Brunch was enjoyed at HEXX Kitchen + Bar inside Paris Las Vegas, the city's best 24\/7 Restaurant now a three-year tradition at Christmas and this year doubling as a 21st Birthday celebration for one guest at the table. \n\nAlways a Restaurant testing the limitations of its space and clientele, the appointment of Due Forni's Carlos Buscaglia to top Toque earlier this year ushering in the complete overhaul of a Dinner menu that now holds its own against any Restaurant of its ilk while surpassing many 'fine dining' spaces in terms of creativity, it was just past 11:00am on Sunday morning that hostesses led patrons to a lengthy indoor banquet reserved earlier that week, a pleasant young woman stopping by within moments to take drink orders of Coffee for most, plus one Potion for the guest of honor. \n\nOnce again featuring shockingly efficient service for a place that does so much volume, Mr. Stotland keeping a watchful eye over the expansive space and coordination of servers with bussers seamlessly filling drinks and clearing plates without ever feeling late or intrusive, it was in three courses that Brunch was consumed beginning with HEXX's famous Fruit Plate, the collection this time highlighted by Papaya and Pineapple best dipped in Coconut Whip while the Dragon Fruit was far sweeter than usual, both on the plate and as incorporated into the \"Magick Dragon\" that billowed smoke upon service with a flavor not dissimilar to the Red Icee's served at the movie theater.\n\nInvesting in both old and new favorites throughout a two-hour meal, the portions seemingly larger than past visits as relates to both sweets and savories, it was with many focused on the fluffy Brioche Sticky Bun that regulars reveled in the return of Chef Matt Piekarski's Carrot Cake Pancakes, the item now back on the Brunch Menu every bit as good as memory serves with lightly spiced Batter fluffy and moist beneath a mound of Cream Cheese Frosting.\n\nSharing all plates family-style, the carbohydrate-heavy first course taking its toll on lighter appetites despite several plates to follow, it was to wide eyes that servers next delivered HEXX's Benny replacing English Muffins with cheesy Potatoes alongside a stacked Breakfast Croissant and Chilaquiles with a lot of spice and several still-crisp Tortilla Chips, plus an oversized order of the typically Dinner-only fried Broccolini.\n\nAdmittedly a lot of Food, the Parmesan Potatoes particularly dangerous when accounting for portion and likelihood of going back for seconds, it was after a brief respite with one guest already waving the white flag that four all-new Desserts were delivered, Pastry Chef Mirada proving a worthy successor to Carol Garcia with thick Pumpkin Brulee that eats like Pot de Cr√®me with a caramelized top plus a boozy Shake served next creamy confetti Cheesecake and equally rich Marshmallow Semifreddo beneath crumbled Graham Crackers and Fudge made from HEXX's bean-to-bar Chocolate.\n\nNot quite finished yet, a tableside Tiramisu still in-process as the last drops of Amaretto trickled through Coffee Beans to Almond Cake below, it was by way of advanced order that Brunch finished with a custom White Cake filled with Strawberries and Cream, @cakegirl702 living up to her name in terms of both design and taste even though most were too full to enjoy it until later.
