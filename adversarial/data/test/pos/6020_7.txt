Great experience having my passport photo taken here. My Finance actually discovered him a couple years back. Small shop and in quite a ghetto building but worth the 6$! Super cheap and he even develops an extra copy as your own keep sake.\n\nSuper quick, can get your photo within 15 minutes and never a line (especially if you go on odd times during the weekday). I'm not sure if he is cash only but everytime we go we only pay in cash.\n\nNext time you go, make sure you ask about his weight loss. quite an amazing story! Will definitely return 10 years later for my next passport photo!
