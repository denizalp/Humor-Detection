I checked out the grand opening another new brewery in Charlotte.   I got their early to avoid some of the crowd but ended up staying for 4 1\/2 hours.  Despite the initial rainy weather and the later cold and wind, the place was crowded.  They had a huge tent outside for the entertainment and 3 food trucks and the JJ's cart.\n\nThe taproom is beautiful with lots of wood and white walls.   The bar is made of copper and the back of the bar looks like something out of a home and garden magazine.\n\nThey had 5 beers on tap: a blonde, a milk stout, an ESB, an IPL and a OPA (Oat Pale Ale).  The stout, OPA and the ESB were my favorites here and I was mostly drinking the ESB.  They also had 3 guest taps from their SouthEnd neighbors (Triple C, Lenny Boy and Unknown). And unlike some other breweries, they also serve wine here.  I noted 4 different types. Not sure if they make their own wine though.\n\nI can see coming back here when they are less busy to get a better feel for the place and to be able to sit at the bar.  Nonetheless, it is great to see another brewery in Charlotte with different styles of beer. I have a feeling this place will be very successful.
