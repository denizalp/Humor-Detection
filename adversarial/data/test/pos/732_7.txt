As a fan of Boteros I had to go with five stars even though there are a couple shortcomings. I was in Vegas for a few days last week and I went to Boteros like 3 times. We spent time at the bar, and I also had dinner there with the wife.\n\nAs far as the bar goes the drinks are amazing and the bartender is very attentive I forget his name but he works hard. The hostess and servers do not have the snob attitude you might find at many Vegas restaurants. \n\nThe food is on point and delicious. We had the truffle Mac n cheese at the bar for an appetizer and it was so bomb the next day we had it for out dinner appetizer. One order is more than enough for 2 people and its probably hands down the best Mac n cheese in Vegas. We also had the twice baked lobster bake potato which was good as well. \n\nDinner we shared was soooooo good. The table bread comes with a lemon zest ricotta instead of butter which was some bomb food network type ish serving ricotta instead of butter.  We shared a ribeye steak that was on point and the quality was top notch.  The chef also added different sauce for flavor which we preferred on the side. The downside I guess was the tables was a bit close and the server seem to try hard but was not able to tend to us as some other top notch steakhouse servers have in comparison. \n\nNevertheless, like Boteros and They get my stamp of approval: Q!
