What's there not to love about the forum shops?\nAll high end  brand stores that you can think of. \nVery good restaurants. My favorite is the \nJoe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab.\nYou can also relax under the painted blue Skyes and eat a gelato. \nBetter spend time here then gamble it away...
