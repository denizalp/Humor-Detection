***************************** 1425 ***************************\n\n   I always like it here at The Buffet at Bellagio, especially during weekday lunch. It's only $23.99, it's a bargain for the quality of food they are serving. \n\n   The Buffet offers quite a few live-action cooking stations such at the eggs, crepe, spare rib, meatloaf, turkey, chicken stations. Guests may choose from the best of Italian, Japanese, Chinese, seafood and American cuisines, offered daily, or enjoy an exquisite champagne brunch on the weekend. Adding to the buffet decadence is a new unlimited drink option for $12.99 per person, for bottomless on Margaritas, Bloody Marys, sparkling wine or beer, quite nice.\n\n   Dinner $34.99, Weekend Brunch $29.99, Brunch with Unlimited Champagne $42.98, Holidays Buffet Chef's Table (Gourmet Dinner) $64.99.\n\n  Their dessert selection is also quite awesome. Their Sushi station is weak, but the carved meat stations and the Italian station make up for it.\n\n  It's $14 LESS than Bacchanal Buffet at the Caesars Palace, but honestly, how much one can indulge before slip back on your bikini for a pool party? You don't want to look 5 months pregnant, do you?\n\n   If you're a M Life member, Gold, Platinum, or Noir, you can go into a separate line, not bad at all and you can use your Express Comp here!
