Came here sometime back and signed up for email specials, I get them regularly, but my husband and I usually aren't looking for specials when we manage to find our way here. \n\nToday, I had her version of 'fajitas\" Parilada, I got the grilled top sirloin. It came in a volcano bowl, piping hot, the two big spoons full of cheese was melting from the heat, and the vegetables were smothered in spices and herbs that made this dish outstanding. \n\nMy husband noticed a sign advertising a strawberry jalapeno margarita, I thought that sounded interesting, so let's give it a try. I ordered one and when it arrived, it was a beautiful looking drink, instead of salt, the glass was rimed with chili flakes? The drink was sweet but had a kick from the jalapeno and there were bits of strawberry mixed throughout. \n\nAs check in on Yelp, we received a free fried ice cream, and once we finished the meal, it came out, it was a great finish to a great meal!  We may have to drive a ways for this place, but so far, it's been worth it everytime!
