Superb Italian food meets cool, funky decor and a relatively hip clientele at Ferro Bar and Cafe on St. Clair Ave. West. Exposed brick, wrought iron decor and a bar with a ceiling so cool I couldn't stop staring. \n\nCome here for the food. The rest is just gravy. Mushrooms garnished with a garlic cream sauce (the 'magic mushrooms' really are magical) , a selection of antipasta, fresh fish that melts in your mouth. Recommend the Pizza Verdura (if you like goat cheese), the minestrone soup (super fresh and healthy) and filetto rosso (mouth-watering Atlantic salmon with a sweet red pepper sauce). \n\nService wasn't great but does it really matter?\n\nRelaxing, trendy and all around amazing. Wish I'd had expandable pants.
