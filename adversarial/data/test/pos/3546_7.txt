Hamburger Hut is that not so attractive kid in your class who turns out to be funny, friendly, and cool once you get to know him.\n\nThey have a few dry items, liquor and other beverages, thus the market part of their namesake.  A few video poker machines are there too, but the reason to come here is really for the food.\n\nMexican fare, and some fried deliciousness are all available here.  I have yet to try any of the Mexican food, although that will happen very soon.  I can't help but order the fried catfish overtime, it is so good.\n\nThis is a deep fried, flaky salty kick in the taste buds.  The fish stays nice and moist while, the breading is crispy and light.  I like these aquatic morsels with a little hot sauce or even malt vinegar like fish n' chips would be eaten.  The fish is served with fries which as Andy t. puts it, are \"too salty.\"  Does that stop me from inhaling them with my fish?  You know it does not!\n\nThe chicken tenders are delicious too, and can be ordered with varying degree of heat.  As a lover of all things hot, I recommend staying away from the hottest they have, as its more salty than spicy.  I think they use Frank's red-hot sauce to kick it up.\n\nThis dingy dive stop will not disappoint.  Come in for a quick and inexpensive bite, be ready to drink lots of water the rest of the day, all that tasty salt will keep you thirsty.
