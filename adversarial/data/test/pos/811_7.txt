Needed to get some keys made, so I dropped by here.  The key machine is located at the front of the store at the customer service\/returns desk.  I popped in and they made my keys within minutes.  The girl working the machine was really efficient and got me out of there fast......which is great because I hate waiting.\n\nWill have to drop by here for other home stuff another time.\n\nReturn Factor - 84%
