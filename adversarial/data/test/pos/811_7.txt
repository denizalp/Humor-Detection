and to think I found this guy online.    He is a straight shooter who won't promise what he cannot deliver.   I had the worlds worst credit until Harry and his minions got a hold of my profile.   It's shameful I had to go through a half dozen companies in this line of work to find one who wasn't out to only make money for themselves but had genuine interest in their clientele.
