On my last day in Vegas, I told my friend I have to come here after our dinner. We were super stuffed but I wanted dessert. He was down to take me. This place is known for those unicorn Taiyaki, frozen custard and Italian Ice.  The wait is LONG and long lines but it means they are good. \n\nI got there around 7pm, they close at 8pm.. When I got up to order, they were out of taiyaki... boo sad sad face! I really wanted the matcha taiyaki with matcha frozen custard with pocky topping. Sigh I guess another trip when I go back, I would go earlier! The guy told me since they opened doors at 8am, they were super busy even until closing. So many of the taiyaki was out, they offered 2 frozen custard flavors which were vanilla and chocolate but they were out of chocolate. \n\nOrdering process, they have a prefix menu you can order off or you can create your own. Since the taiyaki was out.. I got a jolly rancher which was half watermelon ice, half sour apple ice with frozen vanilla custard. Its layered with frozen vanilla custard then the 2 Italian ice flavors and then a beautiful frozen vanilla custard on top.. It looked perfect! Taste wise.. Oh so yummy yummy! Flavor wasn't too bold and the watermelon didn't taste fake!\n\nWhile I was in Vegas, I kept seeing post of Hawaii slowly having the Italian ice, frozen custard and taiyaki pop up but it wont beat the states.
