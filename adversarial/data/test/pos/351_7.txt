Had usual good exp until today. Driver told me I didn't belong on his car because I was going down the street. Told me to use UBER not lyft. Car was kind of old and I could tell it was his own vehicle. Done with them for awhile. Will continue to use reg car services when going out. The app works well but they need to NOT take anyone off the street to work for them as they are driving a vehicle.
