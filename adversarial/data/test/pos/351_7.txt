My fianc√©, father, and I were going out to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived at 6:30 on a Tuesday when the students were out of town.  The restaurant was empty, literally.  The host told us he would NOT have a table for us.  No wait time, nothing.  He said we could eat at the sushi bar. Then, when we went to seat ourselves at the bar he insisted that we eat at a different part of the EMPTY sushi bar.  We decided to take our money somewhere else.  \n\nI hate that guy.
