OK, this is all about the inferno menu which is no joke. Sure the waiver seems a bit ridiculous (and full of grammatical errors), but after attempting the inferno curry, I don't blame them for the warning. It's just so. damn. hot. I'm a 10 at every Indian and Thai place in town, so I figured this would be a fun challenge. I had my naan, large Kingfisher, and dove into the curry pot. At the 3rd bite, I could no longer feel my mouth. It was awesome (no, really, I'm a crazy person). There were so many ghost chilis in that pot that my insides actually radiated heat for 2 days. This place is cool - but next time I'll stick with the vindaloo!
