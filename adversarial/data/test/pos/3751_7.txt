Went here on Friday night and got in for free because I have the hook up with my job. I would have been PISSED if I had paid $10-$15 to ride an elevator. I could understand if you lived in nowheresville USA and had never been in a sky scraper, but I honestly wasn't impressed. I definitely think the view from other, shorter casinos are better because you don't have a view of the BUSTED areas of Vegas (North Las Vegas or downtown, anyone?)\n\nI think I stayed up here for less than 10 minutes. I walked around because the observation deck was closed due to the lightening outside. There is a gross little bar bumping music and filled to the brim with 40-something overweight dudes thinking they're high rollers with equally older ladies sporting acrylics. Uh pass.\n\nIt would be great if there was a place to sit and if the gift store inside had tinted windows so that the glare wouldn't bounce off the windows and obstruct the night view. \n\n1 star because I got in free.\n1 star because they have a squished penny machine (and I collect those because I'm cool like that.)
