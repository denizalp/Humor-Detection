I don't know about you, but if you say something -- STICK TO YOUR WORD. Right? \n\nNever been here before, so I called beforehand to get some information. I asked about their honey walnut shrimp and was told over the phone that it would be 20 pieces. For almost 12$? Eh okay, sure why not! Well, long story short... I get my food to go, count it when I get back to work and clearly only had 16 pieces. Four are missing?! That's ONE FIFTH missing. That's 20% missing!!! \n\nI call and speak with the same person, I verified that it should be 20 pieces -- and then when I tell her I only counted 16, she yells something in chinese to someone, then tells me, \"The chef put 18, he said he counted.\" Okay. So you're telling me upfront you jipped me? You just said it should be 20. STICK TO YOUR WORD. You said it twice! And I'm telling you there are only 16! (When I insisted this, she told me I was counting wrong! lol)\n\nWell, no matter how I worded it, they were not willing to rectify the situation and they were not apologetic by any means. \"THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.\" Isn't that how the saying goes? Well, all I can do is vent about it here... and warn people about their poor customer service and false advertising. Oh, and here is a picture if anyone wants to count with me like a little kid (to decide if there are 16 or 18 or 20 pieces). ;)\n\nThis is what I get for trying some place new. \nI'll just stick to Panda Express up the street!
