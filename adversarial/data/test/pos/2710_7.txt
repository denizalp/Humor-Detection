HOLY!!! This place is FREAKING EXPENSIVE!  I should have asked when I dropped off my blazer how much it was going to be - and then when there was no price on the receipt, I should have suspected! But, who would have suspected it would be $27.50 for ONE BLAZER??\nIt is a white blazer, and it is also much cleaner, and I think they are very environmentally sound when they do their cleaning, but HOLY F MAN! That is expensive!!\nSo, Dove does good work, but way too pricy for me.
