You know I love you Gordon (I've eaten at Claridges several times), but you really have to listen to what I am going to tell you or these Yelp 4 stars will be going down, not up.\n\nYes, I'm sort of a tourist, no doubt like most others eating here, but that doesn't make me a sucker, so don't try to con me:\n\n1) It's not \"would you like still or sparkling water?\", it's \"would you like our overpriced bottled water, or would you like the free stuff that comes out of the tap and we filter it and it'll taste just fine and we'll even present it in a very nice jug?\"\n\n2) No, I do not want the tasting menu that your waiter says has all the things you are famous for (and just where the Hell's Kitchen is the sticky toffee pudding on that menu) and he really recommends it and by the way it's friggin expensive, especially with the wine pairing.\n\n3) No, however many times your waiter tries to sell me the real Kobe at $30 an ounce, and then when I order something else he tries pushing it as an appetizer, I do not want to spend another $100 for the orgasmic treat that I'm sure it is.\n\n4) No, I don't want the highly priced seafood starter, however much your waiter loves it and thinks we should too.\n\nOur waiter was Charles, a nice enough fella but he didn't try to get to know us even a little bit, wasn't nearly as amusing as he thought he was with his several well rehearsed, somewhat inappropriate and out of context lines (\"chef thought you'd cut a hole through your plate\" (yes, my g\/f finished everything on her appetizer plate), \"can I keep the change?\" (this when we had the bill but hadn't handed over our credit card yet), etc.) and unfortunately, because of his constant upselling, whenever he spoke all I could see was the bubble over his head that read \"Good evening tourists, how may we extract the maximum amount of money from you today?\".  Was he a good waiter?  Well he was perfectly fine, he was there when we needed him for ordering, he explained the steaks somewhat (although on autopilot), the water and wine got refilled appropriately, but neither he (nor anyone) once dropped by to ask how the food was or if we needed anything.\n\nIs he told to upsell by you Gordon?  Or by the General Manager?  Or he just wants to inflate the price for a bigger tip?  Whatever the reason or whoever told him to do it, DON'T.  The meal cost us almost $300 as it was, I shouldn't have to feel that I was a skinflint who should have dropped a couple more C-Notes. \n\nOn the other hand, the assistant waiter was super friendly, helpful, all around excellent.  The hostess was great.  The Sommelier was super enthusiastic (he chatted to us for a long time about Napa wineries).\n\nOK, onto the food:\nMy g\/f got the Hamachi Cruda, mega pricey at $22, but she liked it.\n\nI got the onion soup.  It was a very good onion soup, but it was lukewarm and could have been filled a lot higher and priced a lot lower.  I couldn't ask you to heat it up because nobody came by to ask how it was. \n\nThe bread was pretty good.  The bacon one was extremely yummy, no complaints there.\n\nMy g\/f got the Beef Wellington, and I got the braised short ribs, and we got a side of Brussel Sprouts.  The sprouts were deeee-lish, as were the short ribs.  I had been dreaming for days of the Wellington after reading all the stellar reviews.  I should point out that filet is not really my thing, I'm a bone-in ribeye kind of guy, but given that caveat, I still expected to be bowled over.  I wasn't.  The meat was top quality and cooked a perfect medium rare, but the pastry was sort of hard (flaky on top, but the inner layer tasted like it was either undercooked, or maybe overcooked), and the mushroom coating was nowhere to be found (well we did find a lump of mushroomy stuff stuck in one corner of the pastry).  So, as a filet it was perfectly fine but not extraordinary, as a Wellington it wasn't the euphoric moment that other Yelpers describe.  Maybe it was just us (my g\/f felt exactly the same way and she always orders filet), or maybe our Wellington wasn't quite right.  The mash and veggie sides on both dishes were excellent.\n\nDessert: OMFG, the sticky toffee pudding and that stick of faux butter was heaven on a plate.  If you opened a sticky toffee pudding restaurant I'd be there every night.  The French Press coffee was also good, especially with the yummy chocolate.\n\nSo, we were expecting the greatest meal of our lives, and what we got was a very good meal in a very good restaurant.  A flawed restaurant that could be a lot better if you'd just remember that tourists are people too.
