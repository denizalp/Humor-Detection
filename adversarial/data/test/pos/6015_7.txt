Awesome vibe out at the patio bar, we felt like we were at the beach! The manager and owner are very friendly and excited to be apart of this area and hope that their new restaurant gains popularity. The concept for this restaurant came from the same guy that owns all of the US Egg locations around town. I've never been there so I cannot relate any similarities or differences, but this place has a pretty cool thing going. The location is pretty close to ASU, right on the light rail path, and has some awesome interior decoration\/design. Jazz music is their jam. I like that. They also happen to have one of the best sign spinners that I've ever seen. Anyway on to the good stuff:\n\nWe ordered Chicken & Waffles with a side of Jalapeno Mac n' Cheese. I'd say it was pretty good, but not on the same caliber as something like Rosco's. Perhaps it was because I got the breast (I normally prefer dark meat). Anyway, the chicken was flavorful and cooked perfectly, but there was still something awry. The waffles were golden and crispy, also cooked to perfection. Perhaps I prefer a thinner waffle? I cannot quite put my finger on what was wrong. The hot sauce choices could be a little better. I opted for Cholula vs. Tabasco, but I feel like they need some Louisiana hot sauce or some Franks. Maybe I want crispier skin on my chicken. I still do not know what was missing. Anyway, it was not bad, but it was not quite like the chicken and waffles that I have come to love. \n\nThe manager recommended the mac n cheese, but my friend and I were not fans. It lacked flavor. It was bland and needed more of a cheesy taste. Perhaps some ham or bacon, or a sharper cheese. Hell even a little salt and pepper might work. I ended up putting hot sauce on it and that helped a little but not a lot. \n\nI am interested to see how this restaurant does in the near future and look forward to checking it out again. This place has some serious potential to be a fun little spot.\n\nGo see for yourself!!
