I'm sure the shows, dancing, sales booths, etc. are great, but I'll be honest, I'm only here for the food. There are so many tasty options it's hard not to gorge yourself. I got a gyro, some of those little doughnuts, and a helping of baklava that's the size of a small pony.  All of the food is absolutely delicious and definitely worth fighting the traffic and crowds of people. You just might want to bring some mints with you to combat the killer breath after eating this food. I'll be sure to come back every year.
