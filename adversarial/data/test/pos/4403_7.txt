I came to this place bc my sister didnt have insurance and needed her wisdom teeth out like yesterday. It was the \"low cost\" dental that brought us in. Since then, I've actually made friends with a couple of the dentists and I really like them, the price, and the service. \n\nThey do accept most insurances but have great low-cost options if you don't. Dr. Van and Dr. Unger are great! You can tell they like what they do.\n\nThe location is ugly though. Very ugly. The service is beautiful. The money they save on decorating is returned to us in the form of great service at an affordable price. \n\nIt is wierd though that they have cookies in their lobby. Shouldnt they have carrot sticks or something? Haha
