It's not Las Vegas unless you stop in for a hot minute (literally) at Caesar's Palace. This is what Vegas is all about - the sights, the sounds, the smell of old lady perfume wafting throughout the casino. Mix in some smoke, some booze and crying gamblers who've lost their plane tickets home and it's a complete vacation!\n\nClearly, this is a more upscale place to stay and to gamble but does anyone come to Vegas to save money? No. The rooms are clean and there are a ton of them! Beware that you will now be charged a RESORT FEE on top of the normal room rate. Basically, it's another rip-off disguised as a fee but what can you do?\n\nWhat I really like about Caesar's is the antiquated feel of the whole place. Not that it's old and run down but that the statues and paintings and walls really came from antiquity. I love the Romanesque vibe and in Vegas who doesn't like a couple of naked people hanging around - even if they're made of marble?\n\nWhile staying here the check-in\/out process was fairly efficient and the front desk staff was really nice. They have a bell desk to check bags and there are plenty of fine restaurants for your dining pleasure. I really like that they have a food court now which is right next to the entrance to the Forum Shops. It's a good option. \n\nI very quickly lost a lot of money on the roulette table so from there on out I had to stick to slots. There are a ton of fun games so just take some time and check it out. \n\nOne of the best things about this place is how huge it is. There is almost no reason to leave at all. Shopping, food, gambling, bars, clubs, offtrack betting, rooms for sleeping or throwing up - who could ask for more? \n\nIf nothing else everyone who visits Vegas has to walk in, do a lap and then decide from there what to do. So much fun!
