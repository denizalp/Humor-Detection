Let me sum up my review early, in case you don't want to read all of this review.  \n\nDo not go to this place, do not give them your money.\n\nThe group I was with got table service at this club, it is $500 a bottle with a two bottle minimum.  Everything was paid in advance by a third party, so it should have made things simple.\n\nBut we had nothing but problems with this place.  To start with one of the girls they hire to watch over your table kept trying to get us to drink our bottles as fast as possible.  At one point she started pouring people shots without being asked, and then later we caught her pouring out some drinks and pouring new ones.  I guess at 20% gratuity, she wanted more bottles purchased!\n\nWhen we first got here they told us the price per bottle had changed, and had gone up $50 dollars per bottle.  We were given the choice of paying, or leaving.  Since we were celebrating a birthday we decided to just pay it, rather then being forced to leave.\n\nThis place gets incredibly crowded.  If you have a table that is right on the dance floor, prepare to have people crowding your space all night long.  If you are thinking about going out on the dance floor, prepare to be shoulder to shoulder, and be barely able to dance.\n\nAt the end of the night we had even more problems.  Our waitress told us gratuity hadn't been paid, and that we were responsible for it.  (We later found out that it had in fact, been paid in advance.)  In addition we were charged for a few things that were never mentioned to us.  When the mixers were brought out we were asked if we would like some redbull to go with it, and we said sure.  She didn't bother telling us thought that Redbull is $14 dollars PER CAN.  They also brought us out some tiny bottles of water, and failed to mention that they were $6 dollars a piece.\n\nA member of our party went in to the managers office to complain about  all the hidden charges, and being charged for things without anyone mentioning up front that they costed extra.  The manager had a cop there and didn't want to hear any of it, and basically gave the choice of pay up or go to jail.  I didn't know that was the way that Jet treats customers who pay a lot of good money, the threat of jail at the end of the night.\n\nThe time I spent at Jet was pretty awful, and I will never go back, and do my best to let everyone possible know what a toilet this place is.  If you like wasting money to be treated like crap then I guess Jet is the place for you.  But if you like spending money and being treated well, then there are definitely better options out there.
