I happened to be staying at the Mandalay Bay Resort and I had a food credit to use while I was there. We wanted something different from all the usual suspects for dinner. We all agreed that Irish food sounded great. \n\nThere were four of us for dinner. We were seated promptly even though we didn't have reservations. The decor has an old world charm. Dark with a lot of trinkets to look at. \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient. Our waters were kept full and the waitress checked on us a few times to see if we needed anything. \n\nThe food was incredibly delicious. I split the fish and chips with someone and there was more than enough to share. When the plate was first set in front of us, I thought the fries weren't going to taste very good. They looked pale and soggy. I was totally wrong!!  They were perfect...nice and fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. \n\nMy son enjoyed his Irish Breakfast. He said the bangers were the best he's ever had. The eggs were cooked exactly how he asked for them. \n\nMy other son had the corned beef and cabbage. It came with these wonderful roasted carrots and mashed potatoes. There was a basil cream sauce that tied everything together. \n\nWe all ate every bite. There wasn't any food left over. We will most definitely be back here the next time we're in Las Vegas.
