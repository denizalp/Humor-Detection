I had high hopes for visiting this club.  After Krave completely collapsed, and Share was a major disappointment, I thought maybe this would be awesome.  But the truth is, this place blows.  The only good thing about it was Andrew, who texted me a lot after I contacted him and was nice and put us on the guest list so we wouldn't have to pay a ridiculous $20 entry (who does this anymore??)  \n\nThe design of Liaison is mind blowing - and not in the good way.  The place is super small with a tiny dance floor in front and if you WALK THROUGH THE DANCE FLOOR you can pass under the Exit sign (?) and it leads to the larger dance floor in the back.  Don't bother though, no one will be dancing there except the go go boy and girl who are totally into themselves and aren't even all that - because they play god-awful-undanceable EDM crap music in the back.  The tiny dance floor in the front is where they play a strange mix of old R&B\/HipHop with some with new HipHop thrown in there... but don't get excited, because it's a mess.  When I was there, there was a really annoying DJ who kept yelling into the microphone every 5 minutes.  \n\nThere seemed an overabundance of wait staff - pretty much all oddly wearing black vests, which reminded me of when I used to don those in the very early 90's - but unless you are ordering bottle service, won't be friendly or interested in helping you.  In fact, this place seems to only exist to make people buy bottle service.  There's no where to sit unless you do, and all the wait staff seemed only concerned with those who do plunk out ridiculous amounts of money for this service.  I think you'd be basically paying to be tortured. \n\nThere were only THREE go go boys, and 1 go go girl, on a Saturday night close to NYE.  THREE!!!  And they tried to change outfits and change from the back to the front to the back of the club, but good try guys.. it was pretty obvious it was the same dudes.  In the front of the club, two of them danced.. oddly positioned where you really couldn't tip them, even if you wanted to do so.  You guessed it - they are right near the bottle service booths.  \n\nI could go on but why bother... you get the gist.  I sure wish someone would start a cool club with 80's, 90's pop music and House and Deep House, with friendly hot go go boys and a wait staff who just wants everyone to have fun.
