An insult to the black community!  They don't trust us, but will come into our community and take our money and you never hear of them giving back to the BLACK community.  I'm a Black male and happen to go in on Saturday and had a backpack on and was appall when was told I had to leave it up front.  It's DISCRIMINATION ON SO MANY LEVELS!!! I felt like I was being PROFILED!!!  You don't trust me but wanted me to trust you with my bag upfront?  What's next?  Will you be checking Black female purses next?
