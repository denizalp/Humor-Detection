My favorite bakery\/cafe in the area--beats the socks off Paradise, Kneader's, & Cafe Zupas in my opinion!  Healthier, more thoughtful options and greater variety of salads, soups, sandwiches, and pastas.  Their baked goods are also pretty amazing.  \n\nFavorites include the Wildflower Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which comes with arugula, tomatoes, and several types of cheeses (including Brie!!) on one of their amazing grilled breads.  A little bowl of tabouleh or potato salad usually comes alongside as well.  Their vegetarian soups are all delicious--selections vary by the day.  Their ravioli is great--served with some epic garlic bread.  Have never had a bad salad here either.  Cupcakes and croissants are worth trying as well!  Oh, and if you're looking for a loaf of bread, I highly recommend the Rosemary Sea Salt Sourdough!\n\nOne of my favorite places to eat!
