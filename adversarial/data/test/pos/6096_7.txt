My wife and I bought two pair of glasses at the optical Gallery and I stopped in to get my lenses replaced as per a warranty that I bought when I originally purchased them. My glasses were $400 so I figured another $80 for the warranty was a good investment to protect them. Well after 10 months they were scratched from cleaning etc. so I brought them in. They sent them out for a week or two and they came back perfect. I bought the 2 year warranty so after another 10 months I had more scratches. then one day my glasses fell out of my bag onto the pavement in a parking lot and i had a big scratch on one lens. When I brought them in the manager (Jen) said well, they might not honor this because the scratch was too big. She then proceeded to tell me that the warranty only covers 'Normal' wear and tear. I was confused. I considered what had happened normal wear. Then I asked for a copy of the warranty I bought so I could read it and understand. Jen  told me that they don't have one. So I asked for the companies' website I was sure they would have it posted there, the manager said there was no website. That sounded a little hoaky so, I asked for their phone number and I would just call. she said they don't talk to consumers. Ok, well now I don't know whether to laugh or get annoyed because the warranty seems random and ambiguous.  Then I asked if I didn't have the big scratch would they have replaced the lenses because of the little scratches. She said yes. Now I'm just frustrated. well then it doesn't matter that it had a big scratch because they would replace the lenses anyway, right? C'mon, I wasn't trying to get over on them I just wanted what i paid for and what was fair. Understand these were expensive frames and progressive lenses. They didn't get run over by a car or get dropped off a building. I dropped them. I asked that manager if she could understand my frustration. the manager said she would ask the insurance company to make an exception. I Thanked her. She called me the next day and let me know they would repair them as per the warranty. I was relieved and I said Thank you. A week or so later I got the call that the glasses were ready. Great I was set to pick them up and I was going to bring something to say thank you the next day but, my wife stopped by instead. Well the owner personally gave her my glasses and told her that he appreciates 'her' business (she just spent another $400 on a second pair for herself) but, I was not welcome back in the store because I 'Terrorized' the staff (I only spoke to Jen the manager) and I cost them money because 'They' had to pay to have my glasses repaired. So all tolled we have spent over $1,000 in the last two years and I cost them too much money. So I get it. I'm High maintenance and you take zero responsibility for your customer's experience. Thank you Optical Gallery for fixing my glasses and honoring the warranty. I appreciate that. we will not be back. You are now free to be right.
