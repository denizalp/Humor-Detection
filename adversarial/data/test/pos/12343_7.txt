The fajitas and customer service are pretty impressive, but of course the food is well over priced. Five bucks less would be a starting point for the fajitas which do not include rice and beans. The tortillas are clearly thick, so it feels like your getting a chicken fajita sandwich, but it all works out well. The chicken was quality meat and the side dish of condiments was full and loaded. You might get full fast, but the chips are salty, so try a margarita as well. My strawberry special at $4.25 was delicious.
