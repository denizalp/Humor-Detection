We went in for our $250 consultation and met with Bruce Shapiro \"M.D.\" He was quite pompous and dismissive and barely let us speak. He had not even taken the time to review my fianc√© med records and kept asking her if she remembered different lab values(which were in the chart notes, if this clown bothered to review them before our consultation).\n\nShapiro asked her about the same lab values 3 or 4 times as if he forgot he asked her 5 minutes before. I don't know about you but most people don't memorize lab values taken weeks before. Again he was very robotic and aloof and was not really paying attention to what we were saying(when he let us talk or asked a question for the 3rd time).\n\nWhen we were done, we both looked at each other and did not have to say anything as we knew we would not be coming back to this WEIRDO. Save your money, save your time and save some aggravation by passing on this place(don't know about the other doctor(s) that work here but Bruce Shapiro is an oddball looking creep). Hope this helps others.
