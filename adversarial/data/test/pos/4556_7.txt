I hate to leave a low rating without reviewing the food, but our experience was so terrible that I just had to.\nMy husband asked about the Macadamia Encrusted Chicken, and verified that there were no peanuts in the dish because he's deathly allergic to peanuts.  The waiter confirmed that they only used macadamia nuts.  After a few bites, my husband started going into anaphylactic shock, and we inspected the dish and found peanuts.  While he was trying to vomit, I notified the manager and got his contact info.  After the whole ordeal, and our trip to the ER, the manager said that the 'new guy' in the kitchen told him that they were out of macadamia nuts that night, so he just used peanuts instead.  :|\nTo be fair, the place seemed pretty nice, the menu was diverse, and the management was friendly and helpful.  However, the threat of accidental death due to negligence ensures that we will not be returning.
