Flowers and candy (OK . . .  maybe candy . . or brownies) aren't really the key to my heart, so when a gentleman asked me out a few months ago I jokingly ( OK half joking) replied I'd go out with him if he found me the best scallops in the city. \n\nQue Salmon Dave's Pacific Grille.  \n\nThe first thing I notied about SD's was the gorgeous exposed brick, dark wood and candle light: beautiful ambiance . . and as a huge plus, was not too stuffy.  \n\nWe started out with the calamari appetizer which was fantastic.  It was cooked perfectly with light breading and served with a BBQ type sauce that had the perfect amount of sweetness and kick.  The portion was also very large and more than enough for 2 people to share.  \n\nObviously I ordered the scallops which were served with lobster mashers.  The mashers were creamy and delicious.  \n\nAnd the scallops? Excuse me while I take a few moments to remember them . . . \n\nmmmmmm oh yes, mmmmmmm, mmmmmmm yeeeees . . . \n\nOK sorry about that. . . . .  \n\nBest scallops I have ever had in Ohio.  Perfectly cooked, very flavorful, melt in your mouth mmmmmmm.  I have not been back since but that is only because I now live in the 614.  \n\nOverall the service was great, fantastic wine, melt in your mouth food in a warm classy restaraunt.  Highly reccomend.
