I have been here a few times. It's conveniently located! Great to stop here, have a drink with friends and then head on to a restaurant nearby!\n\nThey have a good variety of beers and you can ask for details from the waiters. The terasse is quite nice but can get quite full. Happily, the inside is nice too! You may want to check out the tables they have in the old safe vault area!
