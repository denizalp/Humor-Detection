Chic concept store, and even if your budget doesn't have room for a little fashion splurge, it's completely worthy of window shopping. They describe themselves as a \"a premium concept store for women, dedicated to fashion, art, music, and culture.\" I describe them as very French. The clothing is mostly neo-vintage, so new clothes that have the feel of vintage. They also have true vintage sunglasses. However, what I spent most of my time browsing were their jewelry cases filled with fun, stylish selections that you don't see everywhere. The prices aren't cheap, but they aren't unexpected for this type of store. They also showcase work from local artists, always an appreciated touch. Happy to see another locally-owned spot to do some shopping!
