The best Mexican food in Calgary, and it's not even close. If you don't agree, let's meet at the bike racks and settle this.\n\nI lived in California for 3 years, and used to frequent a little Mexican grocery store with a taqueria booth at the front. The kind of place where the real Mexicans go and you order in Spanish. I've never felt as white as when I ordered there, but dios m√≠o, were those tacos ever good. I still have dreams about them. Succulent, mouth watering, juicy, wet.... dreams. \n\nI tried for years to find authentic Mexican in Calgary. It was all terrible. Especially the one named after table condiments. It was all so bland and awful, no spice, no flavour. Reading some of these others reviews made actually made me angry. People complaining about the tacos being runny and small? That's how tacos are supposed to be! Fresh lime squeezed on top, juices running down your chin. These are the best you'll find in Calgary. They take me back to California.\n\nEl Charrito is run by a super friendly brother and sister combo who moved here from Mexico. I always wondered why it was so quiet at lunch, but the owners told me that Mexican people eat later in the afternoon. I tried coming for a late lunch to verify this for myself, and sure enough, the restaurant was filled with people speaking Spanish. This is how you know it's good.\n\nI always order the tacos, and I usually get 5 of them, but I have a huge appetite. The best ones are the al pastor (pork) and the chorizo (spicy pork sausage) in my opinion. The carne asada (steak) and pollo (chicken) don't quite live up, though my wife disagrees and swears by the carne asada. I also like the deep fried barbacoa taco. I always get them hot, which is spicy enough to leave your mouth on fire. I've also had the little pieces of habenero chile cut up on top when they offer it, which really takes the spiciness up to the feel-it-the-next-day level.\n\nThis isn't a fancy place, it's made to order quickly and efficiently. But it's authentic. A great place for a lunch or quick dinner. The food is amazing. Try it.
