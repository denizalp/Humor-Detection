When I booked my 4 & 1\/2 month old puppy to come in to be groomed I was told it would be no problem to pick him up at the end of the day as it was included in the service. I booked my day accordingly only to to cancel everything because they called 7 hours before closing and told me to come and get him. What a shuck and jive! When I took a taxi from the other end of the city to get him there was no apology and no discount for not providing what they had promised. I brought a chew that always keeps my dog well occupied and it was dry when they gave it back to me so they had not given it to him. I will never go back! What a rip off. Also, they cut his fur around the face when I told them not to. Lazy, greedy, poorly run business . These people have no business being in the doggie business.
