Stumbled across this place while biking home last night and had a pleasant experience. We were greeted by a little counter where you order treats such as pierogis and stuffed cabbage rolls. We ordered a serve of cheese and potato pierogis (3 for just $5) and a beer from the bar (which also makes root beer floats and shakes). Pierogis were great. A nice summer's evening pitstop.
