The lines around dinner and lunch time are always colossal, almost equally so to some of the people standing in them.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of food available here when I managed to finally get in. I guess my choosiness allowed me to luck out and grab the best parts of the meatloaf and pot roast. However, even considering this, the foods seem to contain very high levels of salt. I had four glasses of water by the time I was done with my meal.\n\nThe service isn't bad for such a prodigiously crowded eatery but I won't be coming back until I hear about their food improving.\n\nBut, hey, at least it's cheap. It's dirt cheap compared to many restaurants in the area, although you can't expect too much.
