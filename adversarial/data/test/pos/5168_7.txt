Dear People Who Live in the Computer,\n\nMy name is Shansa, and I am a cat. I do not like many people except my mommy and my daddy. I am not really very brave - I am not a brave little toaster at all - but I am meowing to you now even though you are s-t-r-a-n-g-e-r-s because Dr. Farrar is the very best veterinarian in the whole wide world, and every kitty should know about it. When I get nervous and do not want to eat, Dr. Farrar helps me feel better so that food tastes good again. When I became allergic to that poke in the leg I have to get every year, Dr. Farrar took care of me so that I could go home and cuddle with mommy again. When my pesky sister started letting me beat her up, Dr. Farrar made my sister feel better so that it would be more fun for me to chase her. \n\nI have even heard mommy and daddy talking about Dr. Farrar. They say that Dr. Farrar has exceptional expertise, really cares about us kitties, listens, and takes mommy's instincts seriously. (They seem to think that last bit is a good thing even though mommy is not as good at pouncing as I am, which means she must not have very good instincts.) They say Dr. Farrar has helped some kitties live to be 20 years old and still play, and they say this happened because Dr. Farrar did research and came up with a treatment plan. They say that Dr. Farrar comes up with the best treatment plans and has done so for lots of other kitties in our house. They say that Dr. Farrar has done this for our furmily for 15 years! \n\nActually, I would also like a plan for treats. My plan should be for more treats!\n\nOh. Mommy says that I just had a squirrel moment and that it is time for me to goodbye. So I will just tell you that even though I am afraid of most people, I love Dr. Farrar. I will even purr my little purr!\n\nPurrs and mews,\nShansa\n\nP.S. From Shansa's Mommy: And now that Dr. Farrar has joined Dr. Davis and Dr. Newland at Adobe? Well, the kitties are purring even louder. In addition to seeing Dr. Farrar, our girl has seen Dr. Davis on emergency: he charmed us all. So has Molly at the front desk, Kimber, TJ, Michele (and all the techs), and the facility itself. Four paws up (plus a tail!) for Adobe Animal Hospital!
