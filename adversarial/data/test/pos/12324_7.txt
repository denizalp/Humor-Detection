Wow wow wow!\n\nRecently came here with a group celebrating some special visitors in town. Absolutely remarkable service. Our table was in a small room to the right of the main dining room and overlooked the Bellagio fountains. The view was gorgeous.\n\nThe owner of Circo, Mario, sent us over a bottle of prosecco and it was a wonderful apertif to start our meal.\n\nTwo people in our group opted for the prix fix menu (I believe it was $85\/person) and that contained five courses.\n\nThe remainder of our table ordered off the regular menu:\n\n-caprese salad\n-dozen oysters (delicious!)\n-duck panzotti (little triangle raviolis)\n-mushroom risotto\n-lamb chop\n-filet mignon\n-sea bass (one of the specials for the evening)\n-pappardelle with sausage (my selection, yummmo)\n\nEveryone loved the food. We also had several bottles of chianti. It paired wonderfully.\n\nTo end the meal, Mario sent over a selection of desserts:\n\n-tiramisu (my favorite of all the desserts)\n-creme brulee\n-pannacotta\n-pineapple mango souffle\n-assorted fruits\n\nDinner took us around 3.5 hours. It was leisurely, enjoyable and delicious. I will definitely come back to Circo for a special dinner out and of course thank you to Mario for making our evening so special!
