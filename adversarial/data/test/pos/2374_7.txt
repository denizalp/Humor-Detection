One of my favorite malls in the Valley. Clean, bright and spacious layout, easy to get to, lots of good parking, uncrowded (usually), with a good variety of stores and a nice selection of eateries at the food court. And really comfy seats in the lobbies for the unfortunates who were unwillingly dragged to the mall to wait while their partners shop.
