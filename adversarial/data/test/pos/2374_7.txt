Gorgeous club, but horrendously over priced. I personally would never come here if I had to pay the cover ($50 for women, $100 for men). Bottle service is the way to go here, that way you get to skip the crazy long lines.\n\nBathrooms are clean and it has a lot of space, indoors and outdoors. The pool is beautiful! Fun place to go for groups of women ! The music was all current, mixed with some House sounds.
