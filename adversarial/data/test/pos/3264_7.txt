Since I am The Duchess of Craig Ranch Park my review is way past due. The review will be posted in sections as the park is large and has many different features.\n\nThe Small\/Medium Dog Park\nI go almost daily and I have been a regular since it has opened. The only reason I go is that it is convenient however too many issues have come up and I am beginning to go to other parks. First of all there are three runs, the other two are reserved for large breed dogs. If you have a small dog be aware this is the only park in the valley that has a 35lb and under area, if you have a toy breed it may get stomped on by larger dogs because many owners push the limits. Some owners let their dogs chase after the small ones and often it is not play. This dog run was created with the park and there is very little shade during the summer. In fact, you will need to leave by 7am unless you want to be in the full sun. The other two runs have old trees and shade. I attempted to have the run moved, but the manager said this is how it is set. They did build a shade area and located in  the gravel so during the summer your sandals will be full of rocks, your dog will be orange from the dust and late afternoon you will have a little shade. One of the large dog runs could have saved the city 14k because the trees were already there and the small shade structure would not be needed. There is not a lot of seating, and only one bench is shaded so bring a chair.  Be aware that the blue benches have slotted seats, Henry is a medium size dog and his leg went through the slot and it was not easy to get him out of that predicament. So know if your dog jumps on the bench he or she might get hurt. There are three benches, one small concrete one with a small shade structure, a small square concrete slab. The dogs to pee on the corner so don't touch your leg on the side, and one picnic bench. There are two dog fountains and two waste baskets and they keep them stocked but I always bring a couple of bags. Animal Control does not enforce the rules so know there are many dogs that are not fixed and I assume they have not had their shots. I am glad this park is close but they need to work on a few issues to make it better. The run is not huge, but then again you have a nice park to walk in.\n\nMore to come...
