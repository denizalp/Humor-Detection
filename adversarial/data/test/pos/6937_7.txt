I don't have a mohawk, or a shirt that says \"The Smiths\" or \"The Clash\", so I can only fit in Rips' social scene with my awkward attempts at charming wit.\n\nWhen I heard the band jamming inside, and saw the dance floor packed, I was delighted to cough up the $5 cover. I saw the great selection at the bar, and guzzled some woodchuck winter cider while my pal grabbed some well-made cocktails. The wait wasn't long, and the staff was personable. \n\nThe bottled beer selection also rocks. I got the Red Hook IPA, and before I knew it I had a mighty buzz, with many strangers striking up conversations. The atmosphere here is friendly, and this is coming from a Yelper  who usually sits in a corner surrounded by empty PBR cans. \n\nI just can't get the hang of that stupid game they have on the patio! If you try it and win, tell me your secret!\n\nOh, and one more thing: I kept hearing about \"Obscura\", which sounds like something so awesome that it's too cool for me to understand without checking it out. I'll be back.
