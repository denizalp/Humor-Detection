I used to always come here, and my most recent visit was disappointing..\n\nThe prices are much expensive than it already was before and the service is just bad now. \n\nI ordered a taro shake with tapioca and they brought it out as milk tea with tapioca but not slushed ... so they said they'd make a slush one. they bring it back but I see it sitting at the front desk for awhile until the waiter brings it to me and this time it's WITHOUT tapioca..\n\nso she says \"do you want the tapioca on the side?\" lol like no? are you dumb? \n\nthen I decide I don't want the drink anymore because it's been sitting around there so she takes it puts it back on the same front desk and 10 minutes later another dumb server comes by and says taro slush LOL like what ???? I cancelled it only about 10 years ago and it's been sitting in the air for awhile now lmao dumb \n\ngo hire new workers and ones that actually speak or understand English .\n\nbtw the cups are smaller compared to the size they used to be so you pay more for what you get basically
