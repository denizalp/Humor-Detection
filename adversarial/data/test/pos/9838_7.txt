I'm still trying to decide if I'm a fan of Bikram Yoga in general, but overall the studio was pretty nice. I bought the Groupon for $15 unlimited for 30 days and mostly sat through my first class. It's tough if you've never tried it!\n\nThink 30 sweaty people in a 105 degree room contorting themselves into crazy positions and that's what you get with Bikram. It was strangely relaxing though (could have been that I laid on my mat most the class) and the teacher had a really soothing voice and gave great descriptions of what to do next. I'll give it another shot sometime, but think I'll try some other forms of yoga too.
