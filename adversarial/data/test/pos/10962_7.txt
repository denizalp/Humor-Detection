0\/5 DEFINITELY!!! It's really pathetic that UG only cares about their profits and couldn't give a shit less about their customers. I can't believe that this place is still operating based on how shitty they treat their customers. I haven't been in since December when I was so disgustingly treated. Here I thought I would give them another try asking them if they do birthday specials only to be told it has to be on your actual birthday. Needless to say I'm going to be out of town on my birthday (the 28th) so here I thought they would be understanding and that was a complete joke! These people can't honor something 2 days early when I won't even be in town and had every intention on spending a decent amount of money for my trip. Seriously I think you guys need to take your staff and managers to a customer service training class so that way you know how to treat people with great service and go above and beyond for your customers. It's not right for you guys to be rude, unfriendly, unhelpful, and down right just vile towards your customers could even say your employees and managers are on the douche bag level. You guys definitely need a facelift when it comes to customer service. \n\nNothing I have seen there has ever been above and beyond other then my first visit there. After that it just completely went down the hole and I have been treated like complete garbage ever since when I kept trying to be polite but honestly my patients has been worn out. I just don't get how big of deal 2 days is especially when it's some bodies birthday. I know other dispensaries have no problem and are more then willing to accommodate me. I just thought I'd give you guys a chance to get my business back after the last time. I'll be polite and not post the rude and unprofessional text messages one of your managers sent to me...although people deserve the right to know how you handle your business. \n\nAnd I love how you delete my reviews on leafly so people don't know how scummy you are
