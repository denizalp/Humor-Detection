Ive read they make Taro flavored ice cream and specialize in Asian ice cream flavors as well as they make the conventional ones all from scratch. So I when I read this place was close by where we were having dinner I told everyone birthday girl wants ice cream next! \n\nIt's in a strip mall alongside of other Asian restaurants. The storefront sign is a banner with a smiley face. I wouldn't have known this was an ice cream\/boba store if it weren't for the reviews I read. It's a nice little shop, clean with a few tables. It's a family operated. The owners were really sweet and Terri told them it was my first time there. Ahh... so I was offered many generous samples of different flavors..not little spoonfuls but almost a full cup of samples!! It was my birthday so I got treated extra special on this occasion. \n\nAll the flavors I sampled were all rich, creamy, smooth, with just the right amount of sweetness. They were spot on as well!  I tried Red Bean, Durian, Taro, Lychee, Black Sesame and Green Tea!.  All were so good! I couldn't make up my mind so I ended up getting the 3 scoop deal! Red Bean, Lychee and Taro!  It was a nice size serving too. I think I gained 5 more pounds in 3 hours. Oye..but the Perfect Scoop was the perfect ending for my birthday evening with my awesome ohana!
