This location provides all that one expect from a 7-Eleven.  I have been in and out of here at different times of the day, and for the most part found those on the other side of the counter to semi friendly.  7-Eleven seems to be at the higher end of convenience stores, which is why I don't stop in on any regular basis. \n\nThe parking lot is tight and with the prices being cheaper in the immediate area, I will always seek another option unless it is convenient for me.
