I have just been on a deluxe chicken salad fix lately & it only tasted even better at this location for some reason! Also got the NEW chicken avocado burrito which had fresh avocado & black beans. \n\nService was quick & fast in the drive thru. With even a line of cars we were in & out within 10 minutes. BRAVO =]
