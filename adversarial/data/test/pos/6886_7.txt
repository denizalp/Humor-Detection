\"THE NUMBER ONE BUFFET IN THE LAS VEGAS BY USA TODAY\". If you're a tourist I'm sure you saw that and decided to Yelp it to see if it was any good. Great job!\n\nThe Bacchanal buffet has steady declined for me, mostly due to the behemoth price (~ $50) which could be justified for its mammoth sized choices. When it first opened it was around (~$30) for dinner which made it IMPOSSIBLE to pass in terms of buffets in Las Vegas, then they increase the prices gradually. Bait and switch :(!\n\nShould you go here? \n\nYes if:\n1. The line isn't atrociously long (a hour plus)\n - you could pay $15 per person to get in the \"fast pass\" line \n2. If there is not a major convention (i.e. EDC, CES, SEMA, etc)\n - this would make the line 2+ hours long\n3. Money ain't a thang\n4. Comped!\n5. Relatives from out of town that want to experience a Vegas buffet. \n\nIs it good?\n\nUsually! I won't tell you what to eat because half the things aren't the same. The carving station has been solid and the assortment of ice cream flavors are pretty cool. I like the brown ale caramel and the thai tea flavor. You can get souffles baked to order, just ask! You might even see Dyan Ng, the dessert boss, whose pretty cute :).
