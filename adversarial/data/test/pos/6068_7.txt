Like any other Cirque du Soleil show, KA is amazing! \n\nLess expensive than O but will still leave you fascinated.\n\nI truly enjoyed the whole show, even though the whole time my friend kept trying to talk to me about how much money spent to create the show, and how hard it is to build such an amazing stage and visual effects. \n\nNote to self: Never go with that friend again.
