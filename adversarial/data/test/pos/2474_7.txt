My friend had a VIP birthday party here 3 weeks ago and I was not let in to be with her...add other ppl, approx 30 other ppl, were let in right in front of me. My friend even came out to ask the bouncer to let me in to the party but they forcefully escorted them back in and left me outside. While I was waiting, he had the nerve to ask me, in the most rude tone possible, \"who invited you?\". I'll never, ever recommend cake and I've told everyone my story. Shameful. Btw, I left in tears.
