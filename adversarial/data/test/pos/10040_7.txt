Oh my goodness!!! This place is officially one of my favorite places to come for frozen, creamy treats. This gelato is nothing short of perfect! It's creamy and melts in just the right way. On top of that, they have some great flavors! Five of which switch out every week. These weekly specials are pretty crazy! They usually involve multiple flavors, sauces, candies, cookies and\/or cakes. \n\nI got two scoops and both were current specials. One was crack Pie (that's right Milk's famous crack Pie) gelato with huge chunks of crack Pie mixed in. The other was peanut butter gelato with chocolate covered peanuts and chunks of caramel brownie. This one was actually a special from the previous week that was left over. I'm a serious peanut butter fan and happened to ask if they had anything like that. The guy was super nice and said they had some left-over in the back. He brought it out, let me sample and sold me a scoop! \n\nApparently this place is from Australia and is pretty famous over there. My sister is living in Melbourne now, so I asked her about it. She said that's it one of her favorites and a place she regularly visits! Obviously this place is popular. I'm so happy they opened a shop here in Vegas! Here's to hoping they decide to open more!!!
