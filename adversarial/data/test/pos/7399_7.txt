I have been meaning to try out Coca Cafe for some time now, and my friend brought me here for an end of the semester brunch celebration.  Yay for finishing my first year of graduate school!\n\nThere is no atmosphere to Coca Cafe, which I would have expected from the hipster-ish menu.  It's what I would refer to as upscale Yinzer atmosphere.  The tables are too close together so people will continuously run into you, and there will be children screaming at the tops of their lungs while their parents ignore them.  However, there are some really unique food options and the servers are pleasant enough.\n\nI ordered an omelette with pesto, tomatoes, and feta.  It was presented very prettily, and there was a cute orange slice to give it some more color.  I wouldn't order this again necessarily, as it was too salty for my taste.  I did enjoy it, but I would prefer to try something else next time.  My friend got shrimp grits, which she raved about.\n\nOverall, I totally prefer Coca Cafe to Square Cafe is Regent Square, and I would say that is the closest equivalent.
