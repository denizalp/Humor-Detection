Another successful breakfast adventure with Stefany V.  Peg's delivered good food and service!\n\nWe met up during the week for breakfast which made it easy to get seated quickly.  Service was very attentive.  Their coffee cups are small but it never went empty.  They were really good with refills around the dining area.  \n\nMy fellow Yelper and I decided to split the special of the day: Crab Cake Omelet as well as the Tamale and Eggs breakfast.   The omelet met every expectation of mine.  It was generously filled with chopped up crab cakes, mushrooms onions and tomatoes.  It was lightly topped with hollandaise and capers.  I certainly enjoyed every bite.  The hash browns on the side were a good side to complete the large platter.   \n\nThe Tamale and eggs were no slouch to our tasting.  Again it is served on a very large platter.  The Tamale is accompanied by eggs, hash browns, baked beans, coleslaw and fruit.  Geez! So much food! The Tamale was delicious.  I wouldn't think of getting those specific sides for breakfast but it was great with the tamale. \n\nI always appreciate a new breakfast place opening up.  Peg's did not disappoint.
