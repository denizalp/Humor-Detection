In A Nutshell:\n\n-So you're in Vegas & fiendin' for a taste of Latin cuisine, Viva Las Arepas got you.\n-Specifically, Venezuelan food is served here.\n-Empanadas to arepas (commonly found in Columbia too) are sooo good here.\n-You can order a few of their items & the prices are nice.\n-I really like the location (not the crazy Strip).\n-I also love the windows that let in that natural sunlight, which is the key to foodporn success.\n\nOverall, I bookmarked this spot after eating here and so should you.
