I was actually eager to see this musical, 50 Shades! The Smash Hit Parody, because I have only read the first book and afterward had no desire to read the remaining books nor see the movie.  This parody is based off the first book.  I was not a fan of the book so I was eager to see someone make fun of it.  \n\nI walked in certain that nothing was going to make me laugh but I was wrong; every time I looked at the actor that played Christan Grey I couldn't contain myself.  He was the sloppiest looking actor ever, a complete opposite of the handsome Christian Grey that I read about.  \n\nIf you have a crude sense of humor, it's hard to sit through all 69 minutes and not find this parody hilarious.  \n\nFor instance, I was seated next to a couple and the gentleman had never read the book, but he was laughing so hard sometimes I think I was laughing more at him than the actual play.  It's refreshing to know that one doesn't have to have read the book or seen the movie to find the parody enjoyable.\n\nIf you are in Vegas and want to catch a show without spending crazy money, this would be a decent recommendation.
