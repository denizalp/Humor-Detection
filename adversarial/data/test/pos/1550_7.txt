So I'm in search for the best breakfast place and have started a Breakfast Club UYE, and for the 1st one I picked Lo Los, I have been dying to try them, and being a single gal I don't really like dining alone so the Breakfast Club was my way of getting out and having people join me :) had a good turn out for folks willing to try Lo Los with me :)\n\nOh my when I got there I ordered coffee, just cuz its needed and then I saw they had jars of Kool Aid, ordered me a cherry Kool Aid and you best believe I was looking out for the Kool Aid man! It was sweet heaven! Ok now I gotta order food lol \n\nI ordered the #6 which was Nay Nays, it had 2 waffles, eggs and grits and I added a fried chicken breast, never had grits before and wanted to try them, they came with a big ball of butter and I added some sugar to it and they were a sweet bliss! The waffles, man they are delish! Told Kenny our server I like some waffles with my syrup, so he brought me more if that sweet maple heaven! The eggs, scrambled were perfect just as it, now I havent had fried chicken in years and the one I had was omg so delish! The coating was crunchy crispy the chicken tender and juicy, it was the best fried chicken I have had in years, in fact I have been craving it ever since then! I hit that chicken with some Louisiana Hot Sauce and hot damn that was heaven!! \n\nYou bet I will be back!
