I was really bummed-out one day.... Girl problems.. Went to Eva B's. The owner, an eccentric man in a baggy fisherman's sweater and mad scientist hair was standing behind the counter smoking a bidi. He looked at me pensively then asked me if I'd like an espresso and a piece of cake..I'm like, \"yeah, but no...\" So he gives me this free food and as he's handing it across the counter leans over and tells me to 'fuck the world'. I bought a crazy hat and left his store feeling much better about life here in M-T-L.
