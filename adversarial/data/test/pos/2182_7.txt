Sipping a coffee on the stoop of closed Psyche this morning when an older woman says, excuse me, excuse me. I thought the store was closed. I move away from the door and sit on the ledge to finish my coffee and make a phone call. Said woman pokes her head out the door, \"you aren't going to stay there for long are you?\"  Definitely NOT the way to appeal to prospective customers!!
