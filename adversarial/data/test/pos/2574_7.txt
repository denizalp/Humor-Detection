No. Just...no. \nI can't believe how appallingly bad this place was on my visit today. The food was all dried out, hot dogs were mushy with soggy buns, too much mustard, barely any other toppings.  Had to hunt someone down for condiments.  \nForget the clever commercials. Id rather eat peanut butter and jelly. \n\nNever again.
