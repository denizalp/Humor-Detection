Booked my appt then Read the negative reviews- I called back because I found a lower price that seemed reliable! The supervisor Andre got on the phone and asked me what I was looking for and to give them the opportunity to earn my business! BUSINESS EARNED! Trevor arrived to my house in the time frame that was scheduled, Andre called prior to let me know that he was enroute- Trevor was very nice professional and respectable and I felt very comfortable with him in my home. He did an amazing job! The carpet looks amazing! He also made a recommendation for the future to keep my costs down. I will be making another appt in 6 months! Thank you!!!!!
