Oh my god. My dog is a mess. Always. Because I give him horrible haircuts and if I don't, his knots are out of control. I messaged Tanya yesterday and she came out this morning for the grooming. \nI am AMAZED at how great he looks! I've taken him to other groomers, and it's always good. But not THIS good. \nIt's like I have a completely new dog...\n\nBest groomer in Las Vegas!
