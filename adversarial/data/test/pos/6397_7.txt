I was referred here by a Lawyer I was using last year for some matters. Even though he had never used this firm himself he had said this per John Mertz came highly recommended. He had experience in the situation I was dealing with.\nWonderful! I made an appt. Gathered all my papers together and went in for an Appt.\nEverything seemed fine at first, I gave me all my information and he seemed as if he understood my type of job and how we were paid.\nHowever, he did not complete my taxes on that day. He said it would take a week.\nAlright then, worse things could happen.\nThe worst part was, Mr.Mertz did not do my taxes. A new hire assistant did them.\nHe called me a week in to it and wanted me to explain to him how I was paid. I said you have the W2 form there, I have been assured that Mr. Mertz knew how to do it all.\nWell, Alas Mr. Mertz is far too busy to complete my taxes for a mere $200.00.\nSo 2and a half weeks later when I went back to pick up my Taxes and pay the $200.00 I had told them on the phone they were not to file them until I got there and reviewed it.\nWell the girl working the desk kept pushing me to sign it. I reminded her that I had spoken to her not more than 30 min. prior with instructions not to file them.\nBottom line is , I paid the $200.00, it was done incorrectly and I would tell everyone never to go there again. Unless you want your taxes to be incorrect and have to pay far more than you should.\nTHEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF YOU TIME OR MONEY!
