Perfect end to our epic Girls Vacay!\n\nI want to give a special shout out to our server who rocked (pun intended). The service was phenomenal! \n\nOur theme of the weekend turned out to be LMFAO's 'Sorry for Party Rockin' and when we told our server he let us keep our zen rocks, get it? Rocking! Aw, good times.\n\nMust haves:\n- Black Cod with Miso \n- Toro Sashimi (Shout out to our waiter who helped me trick my friends who were squimish about trying fatty Bluefin tuna belly. He told them it was compliments of the chef. After they fell in love with it we told them the truth and enjoyed a good laugh about it.)\n- Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno\n- Spicy Tuna Rolls \n- Dessert: The chef's tasting platter was so yummy that someone swooped on a part of mine. They even put candles on it for the girls birthdays.\n\nI would also like to note that the presentation of dishes was extremely entertaining. Their descriptions are as magical as the flavors. I want to give a special thanks to the server who served Jessica H.'s dish with such an amazing description that it left the entire table wishing we had ordered chicken teriyaki.\n\nAt this point I must admit that our two large Daigijo sakes prevent me from making any other recommendations. I can honestly say that the food and service were amazing and the tab was worth every penny. I cannot wait to go back or perhaps try the NYC location.\n\nSide Bar:\n\nBathroom situation: I hated that the bathroom was outside the restaurant and is shared with the not so lovely patrons of Rehab Day Club. At least Hard Rock was nice enough to install a syringe disposal. \n\nOn the bright side we also found out that Nobu will be opening a location at Cesar's Palace, which I think will be a much better fit for this fabulous culinary experience.\n\nThe table next to us was doing Omakase style. So jelly, it looked amazing! When I go to the Cesar's location I will be doing Omakase.
