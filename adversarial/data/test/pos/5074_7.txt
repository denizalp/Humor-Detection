I highly recommend trying this family owned Peruvian resonant. It has some great vibrant director. I have gone on multiple occasion once for a Vine and Dine and the other times with coworkers.  The people running this place are have the  loveliest people I have ever come across in a restaurant. \n\nI recommend going for the lunch buffet that way you get to try a little of everything. So when you go back for dinner you know what you like.  My favorite item is the cheese potato salad it has a little kick to it!  This was very surprising to me because I typically hate potato salad but you need to try it. \n\nGreat spot to switch it up your lunch, if you work close by you need to check it out!
