A lovely fun and healthy spot to eat at! Great vibes! As you walk in the  main entrance there is an area to drop off your yoga matts for fellow yogis, which is also next to the crayon bucket and hippie car coloring paper for kids. Ordering style is like an upscale fast food restaurant where you order at the counter, grab a number and find a table. \n\nIf you order a drink they have various teas and lemonade fountains to which you can mix and match! I got a mix of the pineapple lemonade and mango tea..\nFood wise I grazed on the Mother Earth for that earthy meal made of sweet potatoes, quinoa, avocado, cucumber, broccoli, pesto sauce, portobello mushrooms and a vinegarette! I was grounded to a wholesome complete meal! This dish is the same as their sister restaurant,  True Foods with their dish called Ancient Grains - which is the ingredient listed for Mother Earth. The apple didn't fall far from the tree! The only comment on the ancient grains in Mother Earth was the grains were a slightly undercooked and hard. Everything else was superb. \n\nAnyway and either way, the place is to be at and the food  is  organically made. Can't wait to eat here again!! Yum yum!
