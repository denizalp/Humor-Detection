There would be something seriously wrong with me if I made a trip out West for five days and did not visit an In N Out Burger.\n\nWhile regional fast food favorites are becoming more nationwide, this one is nowhere near Florida and I don't expect it will magically appear anytime in the near future.\n\nAs I sat in the stadium watching the Chargers-Cardinals, I kept telling myself not to buy the overpriced concession fare and that hitting the In N Out drive-thru on the way back to the hotel after the game would be the best option.\n\nWhile the wait was a bit longer than I expected, I made the right choice. \n\nThere's not only something very tasty about it, but it almost seems taboo for this Floridian to know and enjoy this on every trip to Phoenix, Las Vegas or Los Angeles.\n\nAlexis was working the window on this busy night, was super sweet and got everything right with my order.\n\nCardinals fans may have been happy with the late rally to win the season opener, but I was just as pleased with my postgame meal before leaving the next morning to head back home.
