This place is small and stifling,, dirty and little effort and thought about the customer experience ( decorations, lighting, hostess stand, signs,). I stood in the doorway Saturday night and waited for 7-10 minutes for someone to seat me or even make eye contact. No signs just be seated or wait to be seated ? Strange but I couldn't have just taken a table anyway, because the 3 or4 tables that were empty were still  dirty and unattended..  Not at all on the ball for sure! Good indication of the food servers and pace of service!! Overwhelmed and only seating for 30-35 people MAX.. Tables are on top of each other. \n\nSo I walked back to rear counter , soda or serving station, I assume cashier ? and was approached by a lady and asked what I wanted? I said dinner and she replies me too !! I couldn't believe it !!!, I assume she is the owners wife? if so , I suggest telling your wife to stay home. , if she isn't I would TERM her., SHE IS COSTING YOU BUSINESS --- if you want to be a comedian get out the restaurant business.. NICE FIRST IMPRESSION ! --NOT \n\nAt that point I knew this place is a disaster ( go with your gut) and she is not interested in quality customer service or friendly service. I despise shitty attitudes and unfriendly people AND dirty restaurants where  tables are empty and dirty and you have to sit next to them and eat your meal. Come on ,hire a damn busboy for $8 \/ hr ( I was one years ago), these high school kids want jobs to.. . This business thinks small and could care less about growing there business.  So I walked out and drove .5 miles to My Big Fat Greek restaurant ( old faithful) and had a excellent dinner once again, so much for trying something new! Don't waste your time or your money here!
