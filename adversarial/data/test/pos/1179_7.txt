split the CT roll w. my friend. we added the chowder fries and drink to make a meal of it. I had iced coffee already so I let him have the drink.\n\nOur total was $25+ kind of on the pricier side, but it's LOBSTER!\n\nI wish the CT roll was a tad bit bigger. I didn't like how the lobster was minced up so small, but it was tasty. Bread was extra buttery. Chowder fries were amazing though. Whoever thought to put chowder over fries is a genius.
