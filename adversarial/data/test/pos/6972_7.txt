Small store in the stone crest area. Staff are nice and strongly want to help as \"experts\" of the panty and bra world. I like the material or fabric used in several of somas products the price however is another story.  Semi annual or with coupons you can get some sexy good finds. They try to cater to all crowds so you will see the classic granny panty beside the sheer thong. Soma will send you coupons do discounts if you turn in a used bra for \"charity\". I think the bras fit differently versus the competitors. Sizes are really different so get sized before you buy. You will have a sales person eager to help you and sale here which is good but be careful of the \"sales\" part of the associate. I think the store is clean and they have several nice products.
