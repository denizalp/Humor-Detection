I like the Indian food here; the vindaloo is to die for, the nan is perfect and the lassi drinks will make you want a second stomach. The service seems decent and the food comes out at a good rate; I'm not a huge fan of the inside and the Bollywood dance videos on the TV's but that's not a hard thing to get over.
