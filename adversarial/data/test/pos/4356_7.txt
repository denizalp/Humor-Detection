Let me start off by saying I was expecting more from Verandah at the Four Seasons.\n\nWhen the hostess was walking us to our table, I noticed mini donuts sitting out and asked the hostess what they are for. She said they are for our guests and you can take one. I took two mini glazed donuts, even though, I did not like the fact that they were sitting out. It looked tacky and for The Four Seasons I expected a classier way of serving them like having them on a tray with serving tongs or keeping them in the back and having the waiter or hostess ask if we would like complimentary mini donuts. \n\nAs soon as I sat down at the table outside I noticed it was dirty. There was a sticky red substance on the table and crumbs all over the table, chairs, and the surrounding floor. For the prices that they charge here, attention to detail can not be overlooked. While looking over the menu, I asked the waiter to bring over some bread and balsamic. The balsamic was low quality and tasted very bitter, the container looked like it had not been cleaned for quite a while and was just refilled before the first shift of the day. I decided on the summer spaghetti and my friend chose the Tuscan chicken salad. \n\n25 minutes later our food had not come out and it was hot as hell outside so we asked to be moved to the inside. As soon as we sat down we noticed it was just as dirty inside as it was outside. The table next to us had dried food particles on the side of it, booths were falling apart, and dust was all in the crevices. \n\nSummer spaghetti- not well seasoned had to add salt, crushed red peppers, Parmesan to make it passable\n\nChicken salad- lettuce tasted like paper towels, ingredients were low quality\n\nI called over the manager to tell him how filthy the restaurant was and that my expectations were not being met. He proceeded to write everything down on a note pad and thanked me for my feedback. I ended up sending the chicken salad back and we shared the pasta. The manager sent over a few complimentary desserts- Nutella cupcake, cherries, Panna cotta with kiwi gelatin on top? Both the Nutella cupcake and Panna cotta were amateur. The cake part of the cupcake tasted worse than a store bought mix and the Nutella buttercream frosting was lacking any type of bold flavor. The cherries were not even good, I felt like the manager just threw together a dessert without thinking it through. \n\nWhen the bill came I noticed I was charged for the chicken salad. I told the waiter I should not be charged for an item I didn't eat. The manager comes back out and says you ate half the salad, and I said we tried the salad and realized it was not up to par. He ended up comping the meal for our sub par experience.\n\nI hope to see improvement after the remodel is done because this restaurant needs to be refreshed and professionally detailed. \n\nI appreciated the manager comping the meal and bringing out a few desserts. However, after the lack of attention to detail at Verandah, The Four Seasons in Las Vegas is not what it's cracked up to be.
