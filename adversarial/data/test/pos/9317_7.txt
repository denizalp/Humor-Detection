One of the better meals of my life. Trust me. My waistline does not lie. \n\nWe stumbled (it's Vegas, everyone stumbles) onto this place while wanting a fine dinning experience in the midst of Vegas debauchery. Every bachelorette party needs a little class and this place was going to give if to us on a silver platter. \n\nAmbiance is fancy. Of the fancy shmancy variety. The service was impeccable. \n\nNow onto what's important. The food. Oh. The. Food. Every girl had a salad to start. We are dainty none the less. Mine was the beet salad and I literally could have licked my plate. But that would have been inappropriate. My wagu short ribs where nothing short of perfection. Tender. Tasty. This cow was certainly a happy cow I thank her or him. For dessert we had the cheesecake and although a super small portion, enough just to  pop the last button off our fat pants. Spanx need not apply here. \n\nGreat place. A+. Highly on my fatty does Vegas tour.
