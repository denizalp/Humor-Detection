Even if this place is more of a fast food place, I LOVE this place! Even though I don't live or work near here, I love stopping by here. I love the Shrimp Chow Fun and the Salt and Pepper Wings. Other yummy items are the Pot Stickers and Crab Puffs. There really isn't a bad dish here. The chef is a sweet older guy with a friendly smile. The servers are also easy to talk to. This place is a small mom and pop shop so support the small businesses!
