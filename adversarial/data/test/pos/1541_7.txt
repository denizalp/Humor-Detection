I hate to admit it.  Cuz, they are expensive, it bugs me to pay the premium.  But, they do come through.  Especially if you are a bluray fan, like me.  I frequently go in with odd requests, happens when you are a vidiot!  They have rarely disappointed.  When they couldn't get it, I was lucky enough to deal with an employee that was also a vidiot and he recommended a solution that worked.  Off the record, of course.
