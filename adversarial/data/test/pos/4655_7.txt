New place!!!  Very clean.  Pass this place everyday when I workout at pure barre and decided to give it a try especially with 20% off until Nov 1.  Friendly staff who are eager to please.  They even have wine!  Went here looking for a pedicure and to my surprise there was a menu of pedicure types.  I chose the champagne & rose pedicure.  LOVED IT!.  very comfortable massage chairs.  Adrian was my girl, very attentive and sweet especially took care of my very tender right calf muscle that I injured that day.  Champagne rose pedicure was $50.  The cheapest is a classic pedicure for $28 to the most expensive bliss spa pedicure $55.  Upcharge $20 for gel as well.  With my 20% discount and upcharge of gel $50 being pampered and beautiful looking feet.  Other devices include manicures, nail enhancements, skin care facials, eyelash extensions and waxing. Highly recommend this place to give it a try.  Next time I will try the green tea pedicure.  Can't wait.
