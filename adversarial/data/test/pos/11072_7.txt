Great service, great food, and the pot o' bread is the best!\nRise & Shine is one of our favorite places for breakfast.  The servers wear pajamas and the ceiling has cool umbrellas and did I mention the pot o'bread?  It's basically a cinnamon sweet roll served in a cup with cream cheese frosting on the side and it accompanies most breakfast dishes here: delicious!  I usually get an omelette to go along with my bread, but I'm also a fan of their corned beef and hash.  Although this place does get busy, they have an outdoor patio for more seating and the wait on the weekends is usually a lot shorter than other breakfast joints.  We just dined here today, a Sunday, arriving around 10:30am and only had to wait for 10 minutes or so.  The staff is always so pleasant and very attentive to your needs throughout the meal.  Definitely a winner in our breakfast dining book.
