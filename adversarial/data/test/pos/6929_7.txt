I came with a friend to get foot massages.\nWe had what I would describe as the most bizarre experience ever. \n\nWe arrived and an older lady greeted us. She said it will be a second and she appointed us to our chairs and put our feet in a bucket of water. Then she got on the phone and actually called the people who were going to give us the massage...tick- tock, tick- tock the PAID time is running! \n\nAbout 10 minutes later the ladies arrived and started the massage. The place is small and there were another 2 gentleman there. The place had some music on, and an older gentleman who was probably the owner's husband was watching TV, loudly...I put on my headphones and tried to listen to some music, but it was kind of hard to tune out the snores from a customer, the music coming from the speakers AND a TV.\n\nThe massage was actually very good, but the situation was very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen the massage was over, we asked the lady if she had the number for a Taxi service, she said she will call the taxi for us, which was very nice of her. She called the taxi in front of us and to be honest, it was very difficult to understand her, she gave the taxi driver very complicated directions. 20 minutes later, no taxi. 30 minutes later, no taxi. We asked her if she could please just give us the number and we will call and she refused.\n\nShe called the taxi back and started arguing over the phone. we kept seeing a parade of taxis pass by and we told her that we would just go outside and get on a random cab, she got super mad and blocked the door so we wouldn't leave, saying the taxi was on it's way.\n\nAfter being there for 45 minutes (inside since she wouldn't let us go outside) a taxi came by (it was 10 PM at this point) she finally opened the door and let us go outside, as it turns out, that was not our taxi but a taxi driver who came to get a massage.\n\nShe asked us to go back inside and we refused, we called a cab that was on the red light and he came to pick us up, she lady was super upset and started following us asking us not to get on that cab. \n\nIt was definitely a very weird experience and I will not ever be back.
