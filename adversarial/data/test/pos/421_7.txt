The best way to describe their food is with this mathematical equation: Chipotle + Hawaiian meats - E. coli outbreak=Braddah's Island Style.  The idea sounded better in my head, but trust me, this is some really, really good and hearty food.\n\nMy favorite item on the menu is actually their coconut bark-- a decadent dessert. This should be one of Ellen's or Oprah's Favorite Things.  Their coconut bark has won numerous awards, which should tell you something. As a rule of thumb, anytime you see the words 'award winning' or 'world-famous' on a menu, you HAVE to try it.  So, when you make your way over to Braddah's, obviously order a burrito, some tacos, or whatever, but do not skip dessert!  You will thank me later.
