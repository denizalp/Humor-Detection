I've never been to a place with such a depressing and uncomfortably creepy vibe. The parking garage is cramped, outdated, and unorganized. The lobby looked like 1987 Miami vice drug bust movie. The adventure dome is a maze of broken hopes, original playstation arcades, and sketchy neighborhood fair rides. \nThe rooms were the saving grace. Enough to bump up this place from a scooby doo murder mystery to just a horrible place to be. The shower barely got hot enough to be considered warm. The beds were alright enough to sleep on but the carpets felt like 35 years of dust, dirt, and human shedding compacted enough to tickle passing toes. The best part of this place is knowing you don't have to call this place home.\nOverall i would rate this 0.6 \/ 5.
