Incoming terrible pun alert: I'm craving Mexican food and 'Anita' fix! \n(hey, I did warn you by saying it would be terrible)\nThis place consistently has lines going out the door for good reason.\n\nYes, it's located in a small strip that contains a BP gas station and laundromat but don't hold that against it. It's small on space but more than makes up for it by producing hefty portions of delicious Mexican food rapidly. Please note that Anita's is open only during the hours of 11 am - 4pm Monday through Saturday. So get in, where you fit in folks.\n\nThe menu is located right above the cashier and some items will be scratched out for the day, depending on availability. I've heard that some menu items can take longer than others, for instance, shrimp fajitas.\n\nI've had the tacos - grilled chicken and carnitas and they were HUGE. None of those boutique-sized portions found at the tex-mex restaurants around town. You can get them traditional (with onions and cilantro) or American (with lettuce and cheese). The tacos can be ordered in 1, 2, or 3 portions. With each taco order, you also get a complimentary bag of chips and TWO kinds of salsa. The chips are not seasoned but they get the job done in scooping up salsa.\n\nMy last visit, I sprung for the chicken fajitas (I was told my order would take a little longer, but the wait wasn't that bad) which comes with tortillas, rice, beans, and the aforementioned chips and salsa. FOOD OVERLOAD and it only cost $8 plus change. Incredible deal. I literally got three separate meal portions out of the chicken alone.\n\nAs for drinks, they offer various flavors of Jarritos and your typical soft drink and sweet tea offerings. The menu is straightforward, nothing fancy. Just good food, served quickly and cheap. Whatever you order, you must pour a few drops of Valentina (the Mexican hot sauce) that's found on their counters. It's a must.\n\nIf you're in this area, I urge you to give this place a try. I know there's a Chipotle about five minutes down the road but consider passing up the frills of a fast-casual chain to support a small business producing consistent and delicious food.
