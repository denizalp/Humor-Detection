I LOVE, LOVE curry so I was kinda bummed out when I found out there wasn't a Curry House near me. This place does make a good substitute until I can go back home. \n\nI ordered the chicken katsu curry with a side order of takoyaki. The portion is pretty good for the price, so you can't really go wrong with that. The only thing that sucks is that when you request some red pickles, they only give you a small portion instead of having them at the table in a container where you can serve yourself to your heart's content. Takoyaki is a hit or miss because the outer shell was crispy the first time I ordered it, but the second time it was kind of doughy :(. \n\nI'd say give this place a try if you are craving for some Japanese style curry while you are in the Vegas area. It isn't as good as Curry House or Coco Ichibanya, but it is better than some of the other places I have tried.\n\nIt is located in a small plaza so parking might be tough depending on the time you get to the restaurant. Also, it is located near Kung Fu tea so you can literally walk for a few seconds and get boba for dessert! They also charge for making your curry spicy so don't be surprised by the extra cost.
