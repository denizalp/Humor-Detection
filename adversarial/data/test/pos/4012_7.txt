DEEEEEEEELISH!!!!!\n\n\n\n    I really debated about coming here because they had some seriously mixed reviews BUT we're in the area of the City of Sin, so why not gamble and I'm so glad we did!!!! Plus most of their bad reviews were about the delivery.  I also went with this place because they stay open extremely late and the other pizza joints didn't stay as open or had a full dining room to enjoy in house.  So this was a perfect choice for us 5 ladies and a puppy LOL.\n\n   So we walk in and we try to figure out where to sit.  We grabbed menus and discussed among each other on what shall we order. Five women aren't going to agree on one type of pizza so we had to get 2! We also discussed other things to fill upon :p  So we ordered a medium Cheese and the other half Sausage and pepperoni, the other was  half pepperoni and the other sausage, I was the dbag who wanted cheese only hence 2 pizzas HAHA.  We also doubled the carbs with garlic bread sticks. We also ordered honey bbq chicken wings and caprese salad. Baby sister also wanted fries but they forgot to give them to us and who needed those with all this food o_O \n\n  So the service here is AOK. I don't know what part of Europe these folks are from but the young ladies seem to be doing all the front of the house work, they may seem cold but I really think it's their culture and they don't mean any harm.  The food was VERY good. Fresh pizza and not dry at all. The bread sticks were so addicting. I mean even with the pizza, I had to try it and I couldn't stop. Making it easy just to have one slice of pizza, two wings and a bread stick LOL. My sister wanted the caprese salad last minute . This was VERY good. Sadly it was to unique for my sister as it came topped with a tapenade, basil sprinkle  and chunks of olives. This was good for me but for her, she just wants the tomato and cheese with the olive oil drizzle.  I gave her A for effort and trying more than 2 bites. We  LOVED the honey bbq wings.  Moist, big and great sauce! We all thought this was a solid meal.  Oh and their rice pudding was so good and random for a pizza joint.\n\n  I can't compare to the other pizza joints in the area but this hit the spot for us. The wings were so good to my family, they came back two days later just for the wings.  So again, sorry that a lot of people got the short end of the stick, but we lucked out and I enjoyed VERY much!
