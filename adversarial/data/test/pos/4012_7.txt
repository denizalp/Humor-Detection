I would highly recommend them! They did  hair and makeup for myself and two other ladies and everything looked beautiful!  I would recommend getting a trial done the day before to make sure everything is exactly how you want it. It was so convenient that they came to my room and they honestly made the day run a bit smoother. They even finished all our hair and makeup a bit early. They are absolutely great!
