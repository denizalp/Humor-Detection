UPDATE\nSo while my order is cooking, I decide to leave and come back in 15 mins. When I walk back in the lady tells me she's sorry, that they are out of noodles. So now I have to reorder and wait an additional 15 minutes. \n\n\n\nI certainly hope their food is good, because their service is horrible! I walked in and as soon as the I got to the counter, the lady asked me to give her a minute. I explained to her that it was my first visit and had questions about the curry. 3 times this lady interrupted my ordering to run off and do something else. If she wasn't stopping mid sentence into my order to take another order, she was cutting me off to help another customer. \n\nFinally we got down to the level of spice. All the Thai restaurants that I have been to have levels 1 to 4. Out of habit I say 2. Then I ask her what the levels are and she says 1 to 10. So I ask her on a level like that, is 2 even spicy and she says no. So I tell her that I enjoy spicy food but I don't want to burn out my taste buds,  and ask if she could suggest a number based on the information I gave her. This lady looks at me and says 2!\n\nSo I see now, I'm just going to have to order the 2 and adjust accordingly in the future. Way to sell your business!
