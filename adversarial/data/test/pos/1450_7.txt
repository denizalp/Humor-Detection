Ramen Sora has some of the best ramen in town, better than anyone else in my opinion. However, it is coupled with the worst service of all our ramen restaurants. Once your ramen is on the table, they couldn't care less about you. If you're lucky you might get a refill of your drink, IF it's a soda or a beer. If you have water, just forget about about it. They can't be bothered to bring a check, or even give you a to go container for an unfinished meal. When I brought this up to the waitress, who's been there for several years, she just gave me a condescending smile and repeatedly said, \"Oh so sorry.\" Couldn't have cared less. Well, I guess I couldn't care less about that tip I was going to give her. Anyways, The ramen is 5 star, definitely, but the service is 1. We have too many ramen restaurants with great service in town these days to accept crappy service from Sora.
