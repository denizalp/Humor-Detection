My first and last visit to rice paper. This review is not a reflection of the staff, as they were great! It does reflect he quality of food and ambiance. \n\nThere was no air conditioning, just a fan in the corner of the room. It's 100+ degrees in Phoenix, you need to have proper air conditioning as a business. My thighs were sticking to the chair with sweat and I had a sweat mustache before my food even came. We asked our waitress about it and she just laughed it off asking if it was really that hot, while fanning herself. \n\nThe food came (I was served the incorrect dish twice before my original order came up) and it was underwhelming. The lobster puffs tasted like cream cheese and I am slightly wondering if there was even lobster in them. The ratio was off. I ordered the pho and it was flavorless. Bland enough that I took a few bites and did not finish it. \n\nDisappointed by the experience and food, as Vietnamese is one of my favorites to enjoy.
