Kaizen sits across from the Hard rock hotel nestled in the corner of the CVS plaza. Between Capriotti's and Ferraro's Italian. \n\nHere is the breakdown according to me. It's in my area.. it's slightly over-priced sushi.. and the service is sometimes good, sometimes they forget things.. lol.. what do you want from a place that is often pumping until 5 am. \n\nWe head over there for a late night sushi fix, and most importantly.. the 2 for 1 .. ANYTHING from the bar.. after midnight. Usually that equals cheap sake and beer.. but it does the trick for cheap. Also I always see Carrot top there.. which is good or bad? You tell me.. it just is :] \n\nYou can find me there on any given evening with a crew or just me and one of my foodie buddies.. mostly for me it's about the liquor and the broiled yellow tail fish collar. Yes... you read that right. if you don't know, now you know.. check it out. It's not that you can't get fish collar at other Asian style eateries, but this one is close by so I'm there most :)\n\nHappy Eating!
