My favorite breakfast place in Old Town. Whether you want a heavy comfort hangover breakfast or a light healthy meal, they've got you covered.  The only reason I wouldn't go as regularly as I wanted to was because of the usual long waits during the weekend.  But the food is fantastic. Great portions at good prices and friendly service. I like the eggs Benedict, the French toast and I've heard good things about the chorizo mac n cheese.
