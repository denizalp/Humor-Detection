This place looked pretty good until we talked to our server. She was rude. And when I say rude I mean she snapped at me to show her ID, she didn't show me a menu, she served my fiancee a major dose of snarky attitude along with his drink, and then she sarcastically told us to \"have a good one\" when we left. The only time she came to our table after serving my man a drink was to leave the bill, and she didn't even come and take it back to the register for processing. We had to take the bill up ourselves to pay. \nI hate my job too but I have a little dignity and I do feel responsible enough to perform my job right. \nThis place makes Ohio seem like los Angeles. \nBoo!!!!
