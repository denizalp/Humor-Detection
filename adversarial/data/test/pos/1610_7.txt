Like most 'casinos', this one does not care about you, in anyway, shape or form... You are a dollar sign to it. I was asked to leave its poker room, but only after i accepted playing with regulars for over 6 hours, and only after i was down.\n\nThey do not care how you get home, only that you get off of their property. \n\nThey put me in a 'car' that did not have a meter, and the 'driver' kicked me out in the middle of nowhere because I would not show him my 'Money'. \n\nNot quality... will never return.
