For ye non Spanish speaking Yelpers, Guero is a derogatory term for light skinned people with light colored hair.  \n\nI got a veggie burrito with brown rice, black beans, vegetables, pico, corn and hot salsas, lettuce and guacamole.  With all those ingredients,  I was taken back by how small it was, and ended up needing to eat my friends leftovers to get full. When you are used to seeing Chipotle and Qdoba give you large portions of ingredients, you feel ripped off when you pay more money for a smaller burrito.\n\nTheir staff is new. They really had no idea how to operate a burrito line.  To El Ginger's credit, with time and experience, that should get better.  But where was the wrap training? My burrito fell apart in my hands, which made it super frustrating to eat.\n\nAnother thing I didn't like: they serve their hot sauce in little packets like Taco Bell which are difficult to open with the lost dexterity that comes with a night of drinking and messy hands from a broken burrito.  Where were the jars of Tobasco and Cholula? Maybe they pulled those from the shelves for fear of theft; I did decide to try it at 2:30am.  \n\nOn the plus side, it's nice to have a healthy Mexican option downtown where you can build your own burrito to healthy or non-healthy liking.  I'm sure beers and friends will  likely convince me to go there again... I just hope for a bigger burrito that stays together when I do.
