Being new this place is clean and bright. Looks like it could be a cool hangout spot. Owner was very friendly and told me about her grand opening coming up in a few days. While I can't comment about their shaved snow. I came in and ordered 1 large taro milk tea with boba, and 1 thai tea with boba. She was a bit inconsistent in making the drinks as my taro was not filled to the brim and the thai tea was overflowing. I got home with the drinks and dove right into the taro. First impression was this drink tastes smooth; you can still taste a bit of the powder used for the drink but I've had worse at other places. Second impression was the boba, while it was soft and tender; it could have used an extra minute or two in the boiler. Overall, ill have to come back and try the other items on the menu.
