Do you have what it takes to be an Ironman?  If you do, Delices Gourmands is the place for you!\n\nTriathletes around the world aspire to be called an Ironman.  Held four times a year, the Las Vegas Triathlon is among the most challenging and most rewarding of all Ironman events.  \n\nThe event starts at 9 am the Spa Orleans.   Participants compete to spend the longest time in the Jacuzzi at the Orleans and still make an 11 am Foot Massage appointment in Spring Valley.  To have a chance of finishing well, you need a time of at least 1:48 in the tub in Stage One. \n\nTransitions in a triathlon are critical.  Many times this is where events can be won and lost.  Between the first and second stage, penalty minutes are assessed if your feet are not soaking in the tub at your assigned Stage 2 Foot Massage Spa check in by 11 am.  As long as it is within the designated area, triathletes are assigned a foot massage spa of their choosing.  I always choose The Best Foot Spa.  \n\nThe transition to stage three is generally considered the most challenging. You must travel from your designated Foot Massage Spa to here, Delices Gourmands French Bakery,  and you must arrive before they sell out of Almond Croissants. \n\nI visited Delices Gourmands twice while I was in town. Everything I tried at this fantastic French bakery was good, but the Almond Croissants were freaking spectacular.  On my first visit I had a Pistachio Roll and loved it. Went back the next day for another and added an almond croissant.  So glad I did, because, spectacular.\n\nI absolutely love this place.  I can't wait to go back. There's so much more I want to try, particularly their French Onion soup.  That's got to be good!\n\nMikey C says: Heavy boots of lead\n                        Fills his victims full of dread\n                        Running as fast as they can\n                        Iron Man lives again!
