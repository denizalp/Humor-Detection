Not sure what's with all the terrible reviews. I guess they keep their slices out too long... Never had a slice here but quite a few whole pizzas and they were all very good. Quality seems to be above that of Gigi's or Nova and would definitely pick this place over them any time. I always get the sopressata and Gorgonzola. Yum!
