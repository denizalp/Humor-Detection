Drops a few stars.  Switched up games.  I dig.  Dude checkin IDs is cool as hell.  I dig.  Still do kids days.  I dig.  Why drop stars you ask?  They have ONE bartender on a busy Sunday??  Also, I see they brought on board the worst bartender in Lakewood.  She is SOLEY the reason me (and at least 7 other people off the top of my head) quit going to Corkys down the street.  Miserable piece of work that never smiles, has ANYTHING to say to customers but damn sure will take your tip money.  Stick to tanning and getting tattoos to go comouflage the ones ya got on spring break, luv...
