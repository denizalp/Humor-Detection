Oh my goodness...I went to this Red Robin and it was the most horrible meal I have ever had!! Maybe it was because it was after 8 pm..BUT my son's burger was soaking wet on top of the bun and he wouldn't eat it. Not sure what it was if it was condensation from being under the lights too long or if it was grease..but whichever it was disgusting. We had salsa and chips for an appetizer and the chips were disgustingly STALE. \n\nThe waitress talked me into a Margarita that was a dollar more because it's a 'double' and I swear it wasn't even a single. Now, while we're on the waitress, she was about 20 years younger than me and kept calling me 'Sweetie\" which I loathe!! That is the kiss of death for anyone in my book. Totally rude and disresectful! \nOn top of all that, my burger was sooooo salty that I had to send it back because my lips and mouth were burning from it and I couldn't eat. I refused another one and just asked that they take it off my bill. Which they did. It was horrible..an hour later and my lips are still burning!! \nThe manager walked by and looked at us but never came over and apologized for the problems. \nAs far as cleanliness? I went to the rest rooms and walked past the kitchen and omg, the floor in there was disgusting! Paper napkins all over the floor mixed in with pieces of food and some kind of liquid. Disgusting. There weren't many customers in the store so I think they should have had time to clean it up.\nI tipped the waitress a full 20% even though my 14 year old thought she was an ignoramous and she insisted on referring to me as Sweetie. Even after all the problems and she never even said thank you or good bye..no one acknowledged our leaving the establishment. \n\nI will never ever ever go back to this restaurant. I am never one to ask for any compensation but in my opinion, having run a business..I think with all the problems there with our food, if I were the manager I would have said the whole meal is on us...no worries. Instead it cost me over $50 for the worst couple of burgers and chips we ever had and I left resenting the place. Very bad business. \n\nI have a feeling they are better at lunch because they draw a big lunch business crowd and probably have all the loser staff and cooks at night? That's the only thing I can come up with. Stay far away from this place!!!!!!!
