Can I just entertain you with a little story about a girl growing up with her 1983 Audi 5000S? She loved it so much, she kept very good care of it. After all, it was her uncle that worked on it since it was purchased, and it was previously owned by a very elderly lady who never let it see a cloudy day. But then this girl decided to move to Arizona. Right away she began calling around for a trustworthy mechanic...\nJoel and I got into a fight in our first conversation when I asked him if he would refuse to take the advice of a girl. I never got into a fight with him again. AZ Imports does no outside advertising. They enjoy a steady stream of returning and new clients on referral-base only. The first couple (five) times I went in, I knew exactly what was wrong with my baby. He diagnosed everything correctly, showing me the parts that were worn\/ exploded and then showing me the part he would use to replace it with. After 5 years, I trusted him and his team (even after they absorbed Bills Beemers) with every rattle and knock my encroaching-upon-historic vehicle suffered. I haven't been able to duplicate that level of dedication to and integrity toward car repair since I moved out to California.\nI trusted him like I trusted my uncle. He even kept my car for two weeks when it had a fuel leak and was a fire hazard. I probably owe him my life for that. He worked with my tiny budget (of a full-time student) and patched up parts when it was (possible and) too expensive to buy them new. If he ran into a problem, he would consult all of his sources from his East Coast upbringing and work on it until it was running perfectly.
