I stopped by this Winghart's with a couple of friends this past Sun. at around 6:30.  Having visited and enjoyed the original location in Market Square, and having a City Dining Card, I suggested that we stop by.  Since it'd been awhile since my friends had had a good burger, they were game, so we ventured over to E. Carson St. to check it out.\n\nAs an appetizer, we ordered the white truffle aioli fries ($5.25) to share between us.  These fries were well-fried and crispy, and the toppings were delicious, taking the fries to another level.  As my entree, I decided to go with the French mac and cheese ($12.50), since I'd never tried Boursin cheese before.  This dish, which is listed as an appetizer, also included crimini mushrooms and bacon, and turned out to be more than large enough for me as an entree.  I really enjoyed its flavor, which was creamy and complemented well by savory notes from the bacon and mushrooms.  My friends ordered the shipwreck ($10.50) and Market Square ($11) burgers.  They enjoyed them, but I can't comment on them because I didn't try them due to not eating beef.\n\nOur visit initially got off to an awkward start when nobody greeted us when upon arrival--we had to approach the bar to get seated, and menus weren't brought over for another ~10 min.  However, once our waiter became aware of our presence, all went smoothly.  The atmosphere is very bar-like, similar to the Market Square location.  While good quality, esp. for a bar, I find the food to be a tad overpriced--fortunately, though, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked $10 off of our check.  Overall, this Winghart's is pretty comparable to the one downtown, so if you enjoy that one, you should enjoy this one as well.
