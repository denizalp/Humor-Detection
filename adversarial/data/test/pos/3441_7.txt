I would have given them zero stars if I could have. The first bad experience with #1 Cochran was in the 90s when my mother went to purchase a GMC Suburban due to our growing family. The salesman refused to talk to her or sell her anything without her husband present. It was the 90s, and we're not talkin' the 1890s. \n\nWe decided to give them another chance because some time had passed when we were looking for a new car this year. We called ahead to ask if they had any red Cadillac Escalades, because we were likely going to be driving the car off the lot that day. They said yes, so we drove the 30 minutes to get to the dealership. Not only did they not have a red Escalade, we sat and waited as they went to \"get the car.\" They tried to push some other vehicle on us that we didn't want and we ended up leaving very irritated. Avoid this sorry excuse for a car dealership.\n\nThese people are disrespectful, sleezy scammers.
