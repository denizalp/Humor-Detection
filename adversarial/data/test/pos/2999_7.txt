**This review is a review about the amenities\/structure that New York New York Hotel and Casino has.**\n\nAs part of my first trip to the Vegas Strip, I wanted to see the Brooklyn Bridge. For some reason I was envisioning an actual bridge you get on, but this was not disappointing. It definitely makes for some good photos. The outside of the casino is pretty cool.  I've never been to New York so not sure if they are spot on, but it definitely gave the vibe of New York. Hats off to the Statue of Liberty. Beautiful! \n\nThe roller coaster is probably what brings people in here, Coyote Ugly, or even Hershey's Chocolate World. I chickened out for the roller coaster, but enjoyed cooling off from the heat by walking around inside. I'm not going to lie, the cigarettes and cigar smoke will hit you if that's not your thing. The casino is right in the entrance so be ready.
