I came in to pick up a new laptop charger and get the upgrade to Lion OSX.\n\nGetting the charger was easy enough, but because I'm on Leopard and not Snow Leopard, I have to buy *two* OS upgrades to get to Lion. Ok, that's fine and all, but the stores don't carry the upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard. Excuse me?\n\nMy only options were to find a Best Buy that may or may not have the Leopard to Snow Leopard upgrade disc in stock, or order it online and wait several days for it to arrive. They can't keep a few discs in stock at the Apple store? Absurd.\n\nOther than that total stupidity, the location was fine, store was clean (albeit busy at an odd time), and employee that checked me out was nice enough.
