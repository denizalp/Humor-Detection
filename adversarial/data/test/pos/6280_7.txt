I've passed by this place quite a few times, but never tried it.  I basically thought they can't possibly have good schwarma with the name \"Wrap a Bite\".  I had envisioned non-toasted pitas and general North American wraps.\n\nThe one person behind the counter was very friendly and likes to chat. It seems like the people who come here are regulars.  I ordered the chicken shawarma and while I was ordering, a repeat patron advised that I also order the potatoes as \"they are to die for\" and that his kids \"go crazy over them\". \n\nSo of course, I had to order them on the side.  The \"fries\" are not the regular shaped fries, but are more like roasted potatoes.  They were really good. I even had leftovers and the next day they were still good. In fact, they were great! I was too full to enjoy them with the schwarma, but the next day when I ate it while hungry, I really was impressed!\n\nOn to the schwarma, I requested extra tabouli and they complied. Not stingy with that. Not sure what they'd do if I asked for extra sauce as some comments here say they're stingy on that. Anyway, when I order schwarma at other places they're stingy or charge for tabouli, so this is a plus for me.  However, I did notice that they're toaster takes quite some time to toast the pita and the pita was not really toasted.\n\nAnother plus is that the server stated that the hot sauce is home made. The hot sauce was not too spicy. But I like the idea of home made because there would be less preservatives and artificial flavours (I would assume)\n\nThis place is so unassuming, and with the name \"Wrap a Bite\", I would never have thought they'd sell decent schwarma. As I said, I thought this place sold North American wraps. Although the schwarma itself wasn't extraordinary, the potatoes were great and the tabouli isn't extra.\n\nGive them a try!!!
