My friend attempted to describe Peppermill to me before we ate there yesterday. \"It's as if Dennys and Rainforest Cafe had a bastard child... Oh, well you'll see..\" Two words: deliciously tacky. \n\nAt first our waitress was prompt in taking our order before the rest of our group arrived. It later took her forever to get everyone's order in. I split the Marco Polo omelet with my friend. \n\nThey describe it as a huge portion, but honestly I could've finished the whole thing by myself. Wasn't really impressed. I felt like it was lacking in flavor if you didn't have a bit of the tomato hollandaise sauce to eat your bite with. The hash browns were good though. I'd much rather have gotten an omelet from the Omelet house.
