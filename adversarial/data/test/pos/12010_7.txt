This place was suggested to our girl scout troop as a fun outing and it sure delivered! The girls LOVED this event and it was very wallet friendly.\n\nWe called ahead and got a deal for our non-profit group. The girls were each given a tile to paint. The hostess showed us all of the materials that the girls had access to-- stamps, brushes, paint choices, sponges, etc. The shelves and walls are well organized and everything is labeled. She did a great job explaining to the girls different techniques and assisted with clean up. There was no charge for paint time, which I thought was really cool considering all of the other similar paint places that I have been to charge a studio fee. The only thing you pay for here is your choice of pottery, and even then I thought the prices were very fair in comparison. They do offer assistance with your artwork; the hostess asked if we wanted them to outline your paintings or write quotes or phrases on it free of charge. \n\nStore hours are limited so make sure you check their hours on their website before you head on over there. Once you paint your pottery it takes about a week for your item to be ready for pick up. I got my tile and I thought it turned out really well with that shiny glaze-- way better than I originally felt about it when I was painting it.
