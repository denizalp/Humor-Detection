I decided last minute to get my hair did for the company holiday party (which I lovingly refer to as 'adult prom'.  So glad that Cathy from accounting didn't deliver a baby in the bathroom and ditch it in a dumpster...again).  \n\nI made reservations the day before through the Blo website.  I was happy that there was availability since it was the height of holiday party season.\n\nI arrived a bit early for my appointment but my stylist, Khadeja, was right on time.  I chose the \"High Society\" do from the menu which was the only updo on the list. \n\nKhadeja swept my hair back in a French twist style with a small Snooki bump, secured with it was a tonne of bobbi pins and shellac-ed it down with hair spray.  I would have preferred to put on a salon bib while the hairspray was being used as it kinda went everywhere.  Khadeja worked fast and we were done within the 30 min. promised.\n\nMy usually slippery and disobedient hair actually stayed up all night and I got many compliments.  When I took my hair down at the end of the night, I noticed that the styling products used didn't make my hair crunchy or crusty.\n\nI don't think I could have achieved the same look by doing it myself and believe me, I tried.  I looked up a bunch of YouTube videos but I just didn't want to be fooling with banana clips and Bump-its so it was worth the $35 to have a pro do it.\n\nI rate Blo 3.5 Snooki bumps, I mean stars.
