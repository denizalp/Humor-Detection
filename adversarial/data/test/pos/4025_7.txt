I have been wanting to eat at STK for quite some time....I missed my chances in LA, NY and Miami.\n\nTonight was the night.  My babe and I got a cool booth at about 6 pm.  When we sat down, I could feel the very vibe and trendy atmosphere and listen to the very cool music in the background.\n\nFor starters, we had their warm bread with cilantro dipping sauce and their shrimp rice krispies bisque.  Their bread was super yummy........and the shrimp bisque was awesome......a thick creamy bisque with a spicy kick.  Just as good as the Palm's or Craftsteak's lobster bisque\n\nFor dinner, we had their bone-in rib eye steaks and sides of creamed spinach, corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and truffled fries.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and prepared.  The sides were all excellent, especially the corn pudding.\n\nFor desert, we had the coconut up-sidedown pineapple cake......totally awesome wiith a wonderful coocnut\/pineapple blended taste.\n\nOverall....I loved STK.  I normally do not enjoy these  trendy steakhouses that are full of fluff and short on substance.\n\nSTK is a trendy, hot steakhouse that cooks steaks like the old boys do!
