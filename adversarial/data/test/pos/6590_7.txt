Dear mr. Ikea \nYour stores are over crowded and has a lack of staff. After spending too much of my time if your store I finally got the required information to purchase the \"right\" product. Unfortunately for me, after spending hours building the bathroom vanity it obviously didn't fit and the licensed plumber couldn't even figure it out. I called IKEA to return the product that is brand new and I was not permitted to do so. For a large company they sure do have poor service. I will now try to sell my newly built wasted time bathroom vanity on kijiji and I refuse to ever buy from ikea again. \n\nBy the way prices at ikea are actually way more expensive now than they used to be and you can buy the same products from Home Depot, Lowes and other independent stores for way less and much better quality that you DO NOT have to waste hours of your life putting together.
