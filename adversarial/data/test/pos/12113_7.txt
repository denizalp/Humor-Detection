I decided, although I'd found a great place in the SW for my waxing, that I wanted to stay closer to home.  Having found Cathy on Yelp and reading all of her great reviews, I wanted to give her a \"test run\" on my eyebrows.  \n\nI take one star off simply for the salon she's in.  Not as calming and luxurious as I typically like spas\/salons to be, but it does the job and its proximity to my new house is pretty decent.  \n\nCathy is very down to earth and made me feel comfortable immediately.  I'm not a person who likes to give much guidance on this stuff.  I like to give free reign and let aestheticians work their magic on me.  After all, it's not permanent.  She was able to do this without a problem.  I didn't have to spell out what I wanted - she did what she thought was best, and I LOVE the results.    \n\nI spoke to her about a facial and extraction, and she was able to give me great tips since I'd never had one before.  Didn't try to upsell me on any crazy and expensive service that wasn't necessary.  I will definitely schedule a facial with her as soon as I'm ready.  \n\nHer prices are excellent.  And I love that my receipt gets texted to me after I pay by credit card.  \n\nI'm very happy with her work and her personality and I will definitely become a regular for my waxing needs, and possibly my skin care needs when I finally take the plunge and get a facial.
