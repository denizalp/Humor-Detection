The story of how MADCAP came to be is an amazing one. It starts during the peak of the real estate bubble, just moments before it was about to burst. Tempe, late in the game, decides they want to become Dubai. It is deemed that the epicenter of this neo-yuppie mecca is to be called the \"Centerpoint\" Condo Towers. Condos in the Centerpoint will feature valet, concierge, and endless views of the smog soaked, slump block peasant dwellings below them. FAA regulations are relaxed and ground is broken on the two tallest buildings ever erected in Tempe.\n\nFast forward three years... The bubble burst and the dude financing the project checks himself out early. The half finished Centerpoint is now an enormous, vacant, glass and i-beam sculpture dedicated to the profound economic blunder that was to be the cornerstone of Tempe's gentrification. \n\nBut, there's some good to be told from all this! The owner of the now empty 7th St. Harkins Theatre (which was supposed to be a health club for Centerpoint) decides to be an awesome person and donate the space to the city for the arts. MADCAP is born. \n\nGoing into MADCAP Theatres is a bizzare yet familiar and comfy experience. Imagine you're going to hang out at your stoner friends house to watch weird movies. Now imagine that friend, for some magical reason, was able to live in a GIANT FUCKING THEATRE with 11 SCREENS! Imagine how much fun that would be. That's what it's like to go to MADCAP. MADCAP hosts some of the most hillarious and entertaining film events possible. I've seen the 80s classic RAD there with a special guest doing BMX stunts. I've watched the cult classic The Room four times at MADCAP. During Thanksgiving, when I wanted to flake on awkward fam time, MADCAP understood. They had an all night Thanksgiving Movie Marathon for me to go to instead.\n\nI'm not sure MADCAP will live forever. Eventually the economy will recover and Tempe will want it's prime real estate back. But, until then let's enjoy it as much as we can.
