This show is AMAZING!  I LOVE the Beatles, grew up on them...my folks had a lot of the albums.  My husband was cracking me up reading me some of the bad show reviews written by people that don't like the Beatles - why the hell would you come to this show if you don't like the Beatles?!? \n\nWe came the day before to pick up our tickets, take pictures and shop in the gift store. And were extremely proud of our shrewd strategy since the night of the performance everything was a bit crowded. I had an awesome moment at the snack bar when dude asked me if I wanted a double wine in my commemorative Beatles plastic tumbler. Oh my, yes!  Who can refuse a Big Gulp of wine? Not I.\n\nThe show blends music, Beatles conversations, acrobatics, images and theatrics into a riveting performance.  It was especially sweet that there were two little kids sitting behind us so we got to hear all their awestruck comments and glee.  And they had little English accents - so cute!\n\n$170.50 got us really good seats with a great view of everything. But the show was definitely not even close to sold out, so they may want to consider lowering the prices a bit to pack the house? \n\nLoved the show and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Beatles fan!!
