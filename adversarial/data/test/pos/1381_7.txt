I've never been to a Bojangles until I moved to NC. Although we had them in Florida, it never drew my attention. I must say I prefer it over any other chain Chicken spot. I especially Love their breakfast! That biscuit and gravy with bo-rounds are delicious!! \n\nThe service is friendly and the food is good! My ONLY complaint about this location is how COLD it is inside. You have to hurry up and scarf down your meal before the A\/C gets to it. \n\nOther than that I enjoy having lunch here whenever I have a chicken craving.
