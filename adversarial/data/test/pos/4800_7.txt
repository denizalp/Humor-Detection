It's an okay airport, just make sure you pre-arrange a ride to your Vegas hotel in advance so you don't have to wait with 3,937 others for a ride with a taxi or shuttle vans. Lesson learned.  I also can't complain because once I played $8 in quarters and won $50 while waiting for my flight.  Southwest from RNO uses LAS for a hub to other destinations, so try to grin and bear it.
