Is it possible that I am the first to review this institution? Surely not... however, I am going to do it with gusto. \nThis megalith of high fashion, beautiful design is a bastion of old Montreal money... and I love it. \nI can honestly say I have never purchased an item of clothing here, but I always come to smell the fabrics and touch the purses. It is New York and London, it is Sex and the City but with class... and it has the true heart of an artist. \n\nThink personal shoppers, eye catching displays, floor after floor of designer collections on fetchingly arranged displays and golden racks. Think purses that twinkle under spotlights, and smells of leather, fresh flowers and diamonds. (If you can't smell the diamonds, you need to step outside). \n\nThe most fun for those of us who actually work for our money, is to go to Ogilvy to have a snack or lunch in the bistro downstairs. It is exceptionally good food, and it allows you the luxury of lingering and watching the ladies who shop in this place. They hail from Westmount and Mount Royal, they are fashion forward for the tennis club set and are exquisite to observe. Their carefully coiffed hair, the complete outfit worn for being seen and seeing. It is sociologically fascinating. \n\nSo my cousin and I had our wonderful coffee and hand made biscotti and were replenished and when we were one with the vibe, we moved on happily.
