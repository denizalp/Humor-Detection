I would come here to get my car washed but for $14 I realized that I could probably spend a few more dollars elsewhere and get more bang for my buck. It's convenient I suppose. You get a car scent and a large paper towel (the blue kind for drying your car - sorry, no idea what those are called). When you drive in there is someone there to scrub. Then you go through the wash and when you come out on the other end you park your car in a parking space and have access to a car vacuum, which isn't free. You dry your car off yourself. I stumbled across this place because no other place was open at the time.
