I am hardly ever in the mood for BBQ but when I am it better be the best, and this place satisfies any BBQ craving I have, and then some. \n\nFirst seen on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives I remember placing John Mulls in my memory banks for a later date. I think 2 years passed by and they ran a re-run of the episode that featured this BBQ heaven. \"Oh yeah!! I totally forgot!!\" A few days later after we saw the episode for a second time. we proceeded to satiate our BBQ needs. I was thrilled to find that this place was like a mile away from my house and it was easily accessible. We drove down the residential street, unsure if we were headed in the right direction and sure enough there was Mr. Mull's property...love shack and all. \n\nWe stepped into the butcher shop where it was very no-nonsense, \"soup-nazi (Seinfeld reference)\" type of ordering. There was chaos and an assembly line of sorts but the employees putting the food together were so nice and John Mull himself came out with MORE food and was extremely personable himself. I ordered a two-meat combo which included a huge portion of chicken (yum), a huge portion of pulled pork (more yum) and two sides. OMG the box the food came in was so heavy. I know now that the next time I go, bring someone to share it with...it isn't the cheapest but you totally get your monies worth. Just a warning...The seating is pretty primative. Once you get your food the only available seating is outside. A few picnic tables under a shack with misters. Thankfully it wasn't too hot and we were able to enjoy our meal outside. In the summer I will most definetly be taking this to go...to my house. Did I mention I live right around the corner from it? (Angels singing)\n\nWriting this is making me crave BBQ now, uh-oh.
