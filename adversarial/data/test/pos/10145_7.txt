Disclaimer: this review is rife with bias. My dear friend has been working here forever, and Connie DeSousa once bought me a taco in Vancouver and I've been smitten ever since.\n\nNevertheless, being as objective as possible, I do actually love this place. \n\nThings to love:\n- mortadella is made inside a deboned pig head. That's pig stuffed inside of a pig's face. It's on one hand a perverted abomination against nature, and on the other hand a delicious delight.\n- potatoes are deep fried in duck fat.\n- they're usually trying to switch things up (food, drinks, desserts) and to keep in tune with what's in season\n- charcut's been sewing itself deeper into the fabric of the Calgary community which I think is super cool
