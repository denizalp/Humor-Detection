Think twice before booking a photosession with this studio. I had a voucher from a family member that I used which saved the cost of the one hour session. I had the photos done for my five and one year old son. After an hour of posing, they were both tired and frustrated, so I took a quick look at the images and liked what I saw, told the photographer that I wanted the CD of all the images rather than the prints they offered.  The CD ended up costing close to $200 - fine, for over 60 images, thats not bad. BUT, when I came to pick up the cd a week later, I was horrified to find out I paid $200 for 10 images!!! 10 Images! are these people out of their mind! I was livid when I find out, and what pissed me off more was that I was told I would have to pay another $90 for the rest of the images.  I cannot believe it, and wish I never wasted my time there. Don't waste yours!
