Scandalous RVC...lol. Yes their cookies and desserts are super yummy but who really thought that was an official calorie count?!?! Anyway...\n\nWe go here occasionally since it's just on Sahara and it's pretty good! Last year we actually ordered our vegan Thanksgiving dinner (for two) from them. I was not impressed with that meal unfortunately. Pass. My friend said it was awesome so I'll have to kick her for making crave it. All the items were super-duper salty for some reason. We hate salt. This year I will cook or maybe we will just go out. Whole Foods here we come! \n\nWe are a fan of some menu items especially the guac dip with baked chips. It seriously is a meal in itself. Their portions are ridiculous huge and I wish they would stop that! Wasteful.\n\nHusbands gets a vegan chorizo taco salad and talk about huge, he can't eat 1\/3 of it. Kinda gags me to think about it. Why so overfilled?!?! I have tasted it before and it's good but nothing I can't whip up at home. \n\nI have had brown rice dishes, vegan chk spicy sandwich, vegan chk nuggets, salads, wraps...nothing really stands out to me.\n\nBUT.......the desserts........wow. The mocha cake is my fav. The chocolate chip cookies are just how I like them firm but soft inside. I guess if you want to vegan dessert binge this is 100% the place to go. All that diabeeetus dream stuff is amazing. Oh and they make a mean soy latte to go right with it.\n\nSoo...don't take my opinion just go try it out yourself. I will continue to visit RVC when I need to stretch my stomach out or gain a few pounds. Hey it's A-Ok! \n\nOh! The service is always nice they always remember us and the guy usually waits on us. Order the berry iced tea, it's super yummy and has whole blueberries and strawberries in it!
