I remember a time when The Mirage was considered fancy...yeah, we stayed here on our first visit to vegas in '96 (yikes, that long ago??).  \n\nFast forward to 2017 and we were back reserving one of their 2 bedroom tower suites.\n\nPros:\nService, Service, Service.  Every staff member I interacted with (valet, bellman, maid, desk clerks), were friendly, courteous and seemed to enjoy their jobs.  WHAT?!  Management must treat their employees right!  (I noted that the bellman all did fist bumps as they passed one another).\nI also love that this hotel is not a maze (unlike the Venetian) and I could easily find my way.\nConveniently has a FedEx shop \nHad no problems with internet\ntvs had HDMI access \n\nCons:\nRooms need updating; paint fading, cracks in wall etc.  Also, decor felt like I had stepped back to the '80's.  And I hated the screens on the windows.  I guess they block the sun, but it obstructs your view.\nRoom service has limited menu (i.e. yes on coffee, no on cappuccinos).\n\nWe had a very enjoyable visit!
