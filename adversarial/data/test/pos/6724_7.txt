Definitely didn't need these tacos. Just hours earlier I had eaten a pretty sizable dinner, but the combination of a couple drinks and the smell of mesquite smoked meat resulted in a pretty damn good bad decision. \n\nThere's not much to Mr Mesquite, and that's kinda what I like about it. Just your choice of protein on a tortilla. You won't find fixens other than a few salsas, but with carne asada cooked this well you don't really need them. \n\nIt is a little pricey at $3 a taco, but I guess I can understand how they came up with the price point. Between hours that are open extremely late and the amount of drunk people in this little pocket of bars, I guess they figured people would pay whatever price tag they put on them.
