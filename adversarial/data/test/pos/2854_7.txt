I am going to update my review for Bar Neon, because it was written in the depths of January. Find me a Canadian who isn't a little bit bitchier in the winter, and I'll question their humanity. \n\nThough I maintain I have bad luck with their wines by the glass, these are the things I love about Bar Neon:\n\n+Their massive back patio with ample seating \n+Their fun wall signage \n+Their obliging and funny servers\n+Decent beer list\n+Excellent sangria (bad wine is A OK in sangria) \n+Their above average snack selection (people go nuts for the wings)
