One of my parents friends, who has been living in Vegas for ages, recommended this place for some authentic Chinese food. They just gave me the address and the Chinese name. I pull up and see a place called Food Express. I call them to make sure they gave me the correct address. They confirm its the correct place.\n\nAs I walk into this place, I was pretty skeptical. How good can a place be with a generic name like Food Express? Like my 3rd grade teacher taught me, \"don't judge a book by its cover\". The rest of my party arrives and we dig into the menus. It has the typical Chinese fare. We order a few dishes and hope for the best.\n\nThe food came out in a timely manner. Wow. It was surprisingly good. The food reminds me of some of the Chinese restaurants I used to eat when I was back in San Francisco. I wouldn't necessarily say this is the best Chinese food in Vegas, but it was good nevertheless. The service was also good. I would definitely come back here to eat.\n\nIn fact, a few days later I did come back. I ordered some take out which was promptly ready when I arrived. I ordered some Honey Walnut Shrimp, Beef Chow Fun, and Hong Kong Style Beef and Chinese Broccoli Chow Mein. \n\nAs always, I posted some pictures. Enjoy!
