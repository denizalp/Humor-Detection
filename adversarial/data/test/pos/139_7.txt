For them to collectively claim their restaurant as an ASIAN KITCHEN is a misnomer and an utter overstatement when what it is, what they are and what they offer are nothing but mediocre albeit tolerable Americanized (i.e. bastardized) Chinese and Japanese food.  But I guess if you're already IN the casino and presumably hungry but either inebriated and\/or too lazy to go to Panda Express, they'd be the other worse alternative.
