I really want to thank the 777 bus service to the Montreal airport - you brought the bitch side out of me. I was surprised but glad that I have that side. I used to like the 777 bus so much - compared to the US airport transportation, Montreal's airport bus was so convenient, affordable, clean, with free wifi... a very good way to impress tourists and show how civilized Canada is.  \n\nHowever, on my way back to the airport this time, I encountered a new 777 bus policy which is so absurd. It requires all passengers to put the luggage on the designated luggage shelf only unless you will hold it. If the luggage shelf is full, no more passenger is allowed to aboard the bus. As you can imagine, the luggage shelf is always fulfilled faster than the bus seats. So  no matter how empty the bus is, and no matter how anxious the flight catchers are, the bus driver will only ask you to wait for the next one... Unless you get on the bus from the very beginning of the line, you will always have to wait for the next bus. So when I was asked to get out of the bus just because the luggage shelf was full, though there were still so many empty seats, I told the driver I will put my luggage on my knees when take the seat. He said no and I was furious. I was yelling and screaming to him and told him how absurd this policy is. Oh yeah, hello kitty can turn into a roaring Asian tiger within half second... The other frustrated travelers who were not allowed to get on the bus thanked me for doing that and I felt great first time to be a bitch.
