02\/05\/10\n\nMet three friends for lunch- a first-time visit for all of us.  Was pleasantly surprised to find that this restaurant had such a nice atmosphere-- pretty tapestries adorned the walls, and the windows had nice wooden embellishments.  (I was expecting another Haji-Baba-type venue bec. of the location.)  Our server, who struck me as either the manager or the owner, was warm and friendly, and even chimed in when he overheard us discussing a documentary on the food industry (Food, Inc.); I'm used to a curt greeting, head down, followed by a pen landing on an order pad.\n\nOn to the food.  Kat and Kevin, both vegetarians, ordered a falafel pita and a sanbusek lunch platter.  Violeta H. and I ordered the chicken tikka platter (hers w\/ rice and mine w\/ salad).  All of the dishes looked wonderful!  The falafel pieces looked so delicious, I almost wished I'd ordered that instead until I saw the marvelous-looking plate of sanbusek that landed in front of Kevin, which made me wish I'd ordered THAT instead!  (I usually stay away from fried foods, especially at Middle eastern venues since many use corn oil for frying.)  They both found the dishes quite tasty and \"easy on the stomachs,\" with only the complaint of the sanbusek's small portion size.  The chicken tikka filets looked moist, slightly charred at the edges, and had a beautiful amber-orange hue from the marinade used.  We all very much enjoyed the hummus!  One of the best I've tried in the valley (although Phoenix's Persian Garden Cafe and Chandler's Pita Jungle still top all the venues I've tried)!  I actually found the tikka to be a bit dry, yet still very tasty.  The salad was also delightfully crisp, the lettuce sweet, and the dressing light and zesty (really liked the cumin on top).\n\nSince none of them wanted to have dessert (we were all quite full and satisfied), I bought some walnut baklava to-go.  These pieces were ambrosial!  They were just the way I like them- phyllo still crispy, yet had just enough honey syrup to coat your tastebuds AND your fingers.  These were literally finger-lickin' good!  I wasn't surprised that these were made with a butter and margarine blend (I asked), which means I won't be ordering them again, but if this fact doesn't bother you, then by all means, you HAVE to try the baklava!
