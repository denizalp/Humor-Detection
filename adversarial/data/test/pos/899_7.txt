This place is way overrated.  I feel like this is what happens everytime someone tries to have \"designer\" tacos.  Tacos are not meant to be designer.  It's already a perfect food!  I came here with a group of four after the Ale Fest and after biting into my first taco automatically wished I was more drunk so I wouldn't be thinking as hard about what it was that I was eating.  The tacos here are sooooooo boring!  Everything tastes the same.  And the men\/ordering form is kind of confusing.  Only bonus is that this place is cheap.
