From the moment you walk in your greeted by a staff of friendly ladies that are sweet and helpful. At first glance I suddenly felt like I was transported back in Germany 3 years ago when I went to Europe and all the different bakeries they had back in Germany which was very similar in presentation and what they offered here. I purchased 7 items including pretzel roll & stick, German Cheesecake, Apple Strudel, Apple Crumb Cake and Lemon Roll. Everything my family and I had was delicious and fresh. The pretzel bread were amazing, great with cheese or butter. They were soft in the inside and the crispy texture on the outside was consistent. The Apple Strudel and Cheese Cake were filling and dense but sweet enough with every bite. We will back to try so more of their other pasties and bread.
