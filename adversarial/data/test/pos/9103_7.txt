This place is a bad Asian version of chipotle. The bowls are tiny for the amount that you pay. They should at least bulk up the vegetables and meat rather than the rice if they're charging 8 or 9 bucks for it. Also, the over simplified sauce was a disgrace to Asian cuisine. I didn't even think about getting sushi because, to be completely honest, I don't trust the young staff to serve me raw fish that is safe to eat. Whoever came up with this concept is a fucking moron. I will not return and I hope that someone doesn't get sick from eating this fast food sushi. C'mon guys.
