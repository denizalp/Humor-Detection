I called earlier today because I was looking for a specific costume for my dog but it was only available online, unfortunately. So I asked the lady whom I spoke with over the phone if they had something in store similar and she had told me that they do have a section of costumes for dogs. So I decided to head over there after work to browse for myself. Turns out, it was only an end cap with not even 5 different ones to choose from. So misleading and inconvenient. I drove 20 minutes and what a waste. Won't ever go there again. Terrible customer service. Be more specific and helpful to your customers!! Not even one star is deserved.
