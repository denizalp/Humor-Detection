So much fun!  These karts are really quick.  I loved the fact that they can time your laps precisely, allowing you to race your friends.  The karts are pricey, at $20 per 8-minute ride!\nIt was a lot of fun though and I'm sure I'll be back for more.  My daughter is interested in go-karts all of a sudden.  Joy!\n\nThe karts are made in Italy and cost $10,000 each.  They have fast charging lithium ion batteries that last longer and charge faster than traditional batteries.  The karts can hit 50 MPH, but you're not likely to exceed 35 MPH due to the short strait away.  \n\nThis place offers something to do in the winter other than watching TV.\n\nRecommend!
