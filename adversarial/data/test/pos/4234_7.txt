Been here a few times for bike night and various other occasions.  Same bar food and tall-ass beers as all the other Quakers.  Staff is always nice, even when the place is packed with suburban rebels draped head to toe in coordinating Harley and Affliction gear.  I could imagine this is where Sonny Barger would of hung out, had he sat when he peed and wore womens panties...
