I have stayed in hotels all over the world so keep in mind while reading my review that I have stayed in hotels in countries that lacked plumbing, running water and basic conveniences. \n\nBefore you think I am crazy I did not choose this establishment - I was staying with someone, who booked this hotel. It was under protest that we stayed there. It was under protest that we did not leave. It was simply to cold to go looking around for another accommodation.  \n\nDirty Bed Linens \nDo you get annoyed when someone eat cookie crumbs in your bed? I bet you would be really annoyed if they were from the previous guest. Do you expect that if the room was not warm enough you could get an extra blanket?  \n\nI have great difficulty putting into words just how dirty the pool was. There was a strange substances floating on top of the water. I do not want to think about it. I bet they have found dead bodies here was all I could think while I was walking through the hallways. \n\nThinking the fine people at Budget Host Headquarters would be shocked and dismayed at the condition of this establishment I contacted them after my stay. Please I know you are laughing but I figured they must care some what about their reputation. \n\nSTOP LAUGHING. After I got off the phone with the individual who told me they quite frankly had not control over what happens at individual properties. I decided: it's 20 below, in Madison Wisconsin and I am staying in a dive called the Aloha Budget Host Hotel. I got what I deserved. If you ever want to get even with someone send them to this place.
