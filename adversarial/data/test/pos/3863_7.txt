I dropped off some polyester tradeshow tablecloths to get dry cleaned recently and my experience was a-ok! Service was not fantastic, but not bad either. The place seems a little outdated but hey, it got the job done! At first, they told me that it would take a couple of weeks because they had to send them away but then once they learned that I needed them sooner, they made it happen! The tablecloths look great! For 3 of them, it was $42. I am not sure if this is a good deal or not since I have never gotten something like this dry cleaned before. What I do know is that the first place I took them to wouldn't clean them, so they must require some special attention! I will be back again when they need another round of cleaning because it is right around the corner from where we live!
