This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas.  We were here for 2 nights.We got locked out of our room due to our keycards not working, not once but twice!!!  This cost me about an hr of my time. On top of all this, there was a half eaten burrito in our fridge, which smelled like a concoction of garlic and puke.  \n\nSo after all this we were only offered a $50 credit for dining! \n\nThe rooms are lacking in size and decor. The casino is small. The pool was tiny.  Why the F would any one come all the way down the strip to stay here? \n\nI will NEVER stay here again.  Wynn\/encore owns this place in every respect. Don't waste your time or money.
