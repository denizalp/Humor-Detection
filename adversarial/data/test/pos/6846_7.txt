Why did I come back here?? Anyone? I guess the kids convinced me again. Boo.  As cool as this place is for the kids, my wallet just can't take it again. \n\nPros:\n1. Fun  atmosphere\n2. Lots to look at\n\nCons:\n1. 16 oz. beer more like 13. See pic. \n2. $60 tab for 1 adult and 2 kids wtf?!\n3. 32 minutes to get our food\n4. Kids burgers didn't come with cheese even though they are pictured that way on men\n5. Server brought check w\/out asking if kids wanted dessert. Ummm why?
