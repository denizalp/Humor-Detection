This is actually a little piece of retail heaven because it's not only a TJ Maxx, but a Homegoods! I'm never in this area, so I took the time to stop in and then two hours later emerged happy, but with a lot less money in my bank account. \n\nTruly the perfect evil and amazing combo, because not only did I hit the retail side hard, the Homegoods side was equally as exciting. While the retail side is probably as big as my usual TJ Maxx I visit, the Homegoods side is a little smaller than the one I'm used to. Not to say it didn't have good items, because I left with some discounted Kate Spade kitchenware. \n\nNow I'm going to look for excuses to head to Bridgeville!
