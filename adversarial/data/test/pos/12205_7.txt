Yelpers you've done it again!  You've provided me with some good \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" sushi, and this one is on my list to go to every time I'm in Vegas.\n\nI was here during the 2010 New Year's weekend and looking to avoid the strip since there are a lot of people in town celebrating the New Year.  So decided to look into my trusted Yelp iPhone app and with a high rating of this place, I know I can't go wrong.\n\nSo I took the wife and kids and we went along with what was recommended, \"ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI\" for $24.95!!!  Just two servings of the AHI POKI pays for it self already, and that's just the appetizer.  I would also recommend Joe's Special roll, Ahi Fever, and the Island Special roll.  \n\nAs for the kids, we were able to make it there before 5 PM so they had their usual California roll (my boys are 3 and 5 and already eating sushi!) and some Ebi sashimi.  After the meal we treated ourselves with some Malasada to go.\n\nGood for kids and has a lot of parking.  The only complaint (reason I didn't give them a 5 star) was service, the waitress forgot some of my wife's order and ended up making the entire order again, but no problem since it was AYCE, it was all good for my tummy!
