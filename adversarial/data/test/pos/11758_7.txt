Dear Giant Coffee, \n\nYou should get a really giant sign to let us know where you are! :) After a brief tour de Phoenix, I finally found you tucked away near the CVS by the Art Museum. It was worth the search. Your shop is trendy, clean, inviting and filled with quality coffee. When I walked up to the counter, a friendly staffer named Hayfa immediately welcomed me and began helping me find the perfect blend for my mood. I'm a chocoholic by nature and the Hot Xocolate caught my eye. I'd never heard of it before and Hayfa proceeded to give me a helpful history lesson on the taste. She told me that it was a hot chocolate like no other with a spicier kick to it, almost like a Mexican chocolate. All sounded good to me, so I ordered it. Hayfa mentioned that Matt (the owner) hand selected everything for the coffee shop and made sure he had the perfect blends. It was apparent after the first sip. I was happy to learn that you keep your hot beverages at the perfect temperature, so I can begin sipping right away and leave with a burn-free tongue. \n\nYour setup is great for working or to use as a meeting space. It's nice that visitors have the option to set up shop at a high-top working station or sit on family-style benches throughout the coffee shop. Your shop isn't huge, but it's a good size. You have free wi-fi (yay!). For shopaholics like me, I loved the boutique attached to your shop. Buyer beware, there are some cute items lurking inside!! \n\nMy Top Five Likes:\n\n1. Free Wi Fi \n2. Personal work stations \n3. Hand selected coffee \n4. Friendly staff \n5. Great location and set-up (once you find it!) \n\nSo, until next time Giant Coffee. And trust me, there will be a next time. \n\nLove, Lindsey\n\nPS: Since it was so hard for me to find it, I decided to take this opportunity to spell out the directions. If you are traveling south on Central, make a left on McDowell and keep your eyes open. Are they wide open? OK, the second you see CVS, look for a small alley and make a right. Giant Coffee is hidden next door to CVS and you can very easily pass it. When I visited, they didn't have a phone number listed yet, but luckily for you, they do now!
