This year I decided to celebrate my birthday VIP style at Kandy Bar! We came on a Friday night, only half of the nightclub was open, this was more of an intimate feel. NOTE: On Friday nights you can expect hip hop music all evening.  \n\nI booked a VIP Table one week in advance, the reservation process was quick and easy. Here's something odd! I was subjected to paying cash at the door when we arrived. My friends had to wait in the VIP line, while I went inside to the ATM. After paying we were escorted to our table. I ordered a bottle of Grey Goose with pineapple and cranberry juice. The bottle arrived inside of a Glow logo presenter serving tray! So cool! Our bottle service girl was super nice, she took great care of us. A few of my friends ordered additional shots.\n\nThis was possibly the best birthday celebration ever! I am interested in coming back on a Saturday, hopefully, I won't have to pay cash this time.
