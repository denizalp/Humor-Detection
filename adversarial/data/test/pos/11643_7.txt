Vegan pizza alert! Although many reviews for Il Focolaio from the past reflect on vegan options, most also mention that your option is to leave off cheese and\/or order a tofu pizza. I'm happy to report that vegan cheese is in fact available here and it's sinfully divine (you wanna hate yourself but don't). \n\nDon't get me wrong. Tofu pizza is cool and all but when you are surrounded by pie upon glorious pie, Neapolitan style, thin crust \"wet\" pies (sauce *and* cheese), you kinda want... cheese. Have you had vegan cheese these days? Suffering plastic textures and stringy goopy flavorless messes are a distant memory. Il Focolaio's may (?) be made in house because I don't recognize it, unless it's a Canadian commercial brand that isn't available in the states. It's not Daiya (most commonly found in pizzerias these days). It's very similar to Miyoko's fine cashew VeganMozz in fact, super creamy and so good that it feels bad. The Il Carciofi has just the right amount of toppings (my favorite on pizza: mushrooms, artichokes and black olives). \n\nI had ordered up the whole grain Omega 3 vegan crust. While it was tasty, I would have much preferred a typical crust made with white flour (I'm a traditionalist). I'm not sure if that crust is vegan, however, as only the gluten free and Omega 3 crust was marked as vegan. \n\nCan I mention, too, that our waitress was awesome? I feel like she might have been an owner or connected to the business in some way, because she genuinely was interested in my opinion of the vegan pizza. Blonde, super sweet lady, worked the insanely packed and loud room like a pro. They had run out of wine glasses and she was kind enough to come over to me and promise that my wine was on the way. Typically in packed situations like this, you're going to be ignored, especially seeing as we were at the end of a long row of people.\n\nAnd man, do people love this place (with good reason). It was too hot, crowded and loud as can be (hot because of the open kitchen and beautifully displayed pizza oven, but I'm also not sure the AC was working). A date place, this isn't. Also not sure how larger people would ever be able to navigate to tables along the wall. I note all of this because atmosphere is pretty important to me and I think I'd be more inclined to take out from here (proof of how good the pizza is, as I rarely do takeout). \n\nThe menu is impressive. So. Many. Varieties. So little stomach capacity. Had my crust been traditional, I would rate the Di Carciofi pizza in my top five vegan pizza experiences, along with Pauly Gee's in Greenpoint and Da Michele in Naples.
