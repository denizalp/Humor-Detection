We booked the Plaza in a package. The hotel is very cheap so we were worried, specially after reading the reviews. \nWe arrived after 130am. We did inform the hotel prior that we will be checking in after midnight.\nThe check in was fast however they did not have our booked room available (king) and the lady unfortunately did not seem the happiest on earth either. \n\nThe room had a horrible view of the parking lot but toward the new strip. The room itself was quite big!\nNew furniture, new carpet, a tiny new flat screen TV. \nThe bathroom.. I know a lot complain about the bathroom size. I figure those people must live in a spacious mansion or something because our apartment bathroom has the same size...\n\nThere was NOTHING wrong with the bathroom size. Either the persons complaining are 300lbs whales or 7 feet tall. We (6' and 6'4) didn't have any issues with the bathroom.\n\nEverything was good except the A\/C sorry.. the heater works btw you just need to set the machine to RED button for HEAT :)\n\nBeds are comfy, but the pillows... are like nothing, so thin! even with two, it was like sleeping with none :(\n\nThe casino itself is old and it is smelly. It makes your hair stink very bad. But all downtown casinos have this lingering old cigarette smell. We obtained the rewards card and got some nice perks.\n\nAll in all, it is not a bad place to stay, it is super cheap and right in the action of Freemont. \n\nThe best: i have lost my camera and called 2 weeks later. Lost and found was SO nice!
