OHSO is a great place for beers and pub food, but I recommend coming during non-peak hours when the place is not overrun by screaming kids.  At other times, it's a lot more relaxing with just the adults.\n\nFor food, I really like the portobello sandwich because I can substitute the meat with turkey for a healthier option.  I also like the Gobbler, which comes with turkey meat as the standard.  My boyfriend prefers the grilled pork skillet.\n\nBesides OHSO's great variety of beers, I really like the white sangria.\n\nCHEERS!
