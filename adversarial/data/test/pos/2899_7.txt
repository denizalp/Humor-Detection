I gave 3 stars because the new thrift store in Fenton doesn't have that old smell.  The employees actually told me they take clothes home and wash them before they sell them.  There is a variety to choose from.  My two complaints are:  (1)  I saw some solar lights with a price of $2 on them.  When I took them up to pay for them, I was charged $10 (I told them to put them back).  I asked why and was told the original store (maybe Lowe's?) had them sale priced for $2, but St Vincent's price was $10!   (2)  I called their donation line to make a clothing donation (some new clothes that I had only worn once, or, not at all).  I was told that unless I donated 10 bags or furniture, they would not send a truck by to get them, even though the truck was going to be in my neighborhood 9 days later.  Ten bags?  Come on... really?  I do actually need some clothes to wear myself!  Needless to say, I'll call the Salvation Army or anywhere else that doesn't consider 4 bags as not enough.  They say give until it hurts, well, I really don't think the world is prepared to see me walking around with nothing on!
