I tend to only review restaurant if they really make an impression on me, and Barrio definitely did that. I love tacos in all their glorious forms and this place has quite the extensive menu. Their taco suggestion menu is on par, but my favorite is the create-your-own option. I've eaten here when I ate meat, when I was a vegetarian, and even when I transitioned to vegan and I have never been disappointed in what I got. Definitely a must try if you love tacos and margaritas!
