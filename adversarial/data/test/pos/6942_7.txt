Went to a Dodgers game here and besides the free parking and the uniquely colored stadium (desert color), it was quite a normal experience with high prices etc. The website even listed the wrong price for lawn seats, which ended up costing $12 each, not the $9 on the website. It was mid-week, so it was not surge pricing, unless you count the $12 cans of Mike's lemonade ot the $10 beers. I despise hot dogs, but they have Dodger dogs, but not much else exciting. Go watch the game, get some peanuts, leave in the 6th or 7th and eat a late lunch at Westgate for a better experience. By the way, Tommy Lasorda is still alive and signs autographs right next to a trash can. Ironic huh?
