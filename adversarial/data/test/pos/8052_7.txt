I have been a Rogers customer for over ten years and I have had tonnes of issues. The reason why I am giving them a semi-good rating is because I believe that most telecommunications companies will have issues. My grandma has been with so many companies and for some reason she ends up switching. She switches so often and it is exhausting for me because she makes me either research the company or call them. She has been with Bell multiple times and lord help my soul if I have to call Bell. I have lost it like I didn't even know I could, turning into a foul talking demon. Bell customer service is truly the worst. Recently, we decided to try Primus at my house. Wow... that was a nightmare that I couldn't even imagine. I will spare you the details because this review is about Rogers. During that traumatic period, Rogers was able to keep our internet connection when we were set to cancel the next day, when we called just the night before the cancellation. Essentially, those experiences made me appreciate Rogers more. Over the years, I am grateful to Rogers for honing my negotiation skills, assertiveness, and exercising my ability to remain calm in unfortunate situations. If they are at fault, I call them with a stern attitude, and it gets the job done. We recently switched back to Rogers for home phone and internet, and I also upgraded to a new phone, while getting a better plan (this took time... about 2 months speaking to different representatives, depends on who you get). I now have a fantastic, cheap plan, and was able to wave my early contract cancellation that I had with my old phone, while upgrading to a better phone and signing a new 2-year term. Having negotiated everything in advance, I had a mild heart attack when I saw that our bill was 485 when it should have been 200 (including the 100 that I was to pay for the new phone). I printed the 16 page bill, highlighted all of the errors, and called them in confidence that I was going to get all of the charges reversed. This is important. Be confident and positive. There were many errors on the bill, and a couple of charges that were legit but that I was not informed of, so I asked for those to be removed as well. I asked to speak to the manager right away, but the customer service representative asked if she could help me first. And she did. She was fantastic, kudos to her. Essentially, the way their billing system works resulted in errors, but luckily, there were notes for some of the charges, so it was easy to reverse those (Tip: When discussing something important with an associate, make your own personal note of the date and whom you spoke to for potential future needs). Due to my acute negotiation skills from years of being a Rogers customer, I was able to easily convince them to remove the other fees. To be honest, I was not going to take no for an answer. Fee after fee was removed, and my bill went down from 485 to 201 (including $100 for the new phone), and that is for internet, cable, home phone, and mobile. I must have tougher skin from being a Rogers customer (an important life asset, thank you, Rogers), because I did not find the call stressful. However, you have to be a detective because those bills are sometimes hard to interpret. They now have an upgraded online system where you can see your new total for the bill online. Another tip, if you do not have unlimited data or talk, monitor your usage online so that you can make sure you do not go over and that if they overcharge you, you can throw it back at them (take screen shots of the usage if you have to\/if you have had an issue with this).\nAlso, whenever I have had internet connection issues (rare) I have called Rogers and they have been able to quickly resolve the issue in a matter of minutes. I find that the customer service is generally good. Their technicians are fantastic. I do always compare Rogers to Bell, because Bell makes me want to rip my skin off, and I appreciate them more as a result. Rogers also has excellent reception, and our internet connection is finally good and has been for years (at one point we had to change our modem like 4 times, years ago). I suggest you go with Rogers if you can get a good deal, but negotiate, and stay on top of your bill for \"wtf is this\" charges, which are bound to happen, but I feel like they do with some companies (no company is perfect, and there are drawbacks to most), and you can get them reversed. Show them who is in charge.\n\nP.S. \n1. We used to have issues with \"exceeding our internet usage\" every time they had a technical switch over in the way they track data. When this happened, everyone my mom worked with that was with Rogers had this issue. Track your usage, and stay firm that you did not go over by referring to your past usage.\n2. My mother was a victim of fraud, because at the end it turned out that a Rogers employee stole her identity.
