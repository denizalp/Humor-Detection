It was a 1st date, and he picked the place, told me we were headed out to get some sushi, and I was like yea! Love me some sushi! We got to How Do You Roll, and I thought, wow what a cute name, but then stepped inside and saw it meant literality how do you roll, like what do you like for your rolls, Now me being a new person of sushi only know how to order of the menu of rolls put together, so I felt dumb not knowing what to make, thanks HDYR haha , time for me to start learning so that when I come back the next time I will sound like a pro!\n\nWe ordered the Philly Roll, which was salmon, avocado & cream cheese, it was good and tasty I liked it!\n \nAlso ordered the Slamming Salmon Roll, had salmon, jalapenos, cream cheese, strawberries covered in sauce. Now who would have thought salmon and strawberries & jalapenos would work, but omg they do! This was a great roll! And it started giving me ideas for other rolls! It had heat & a sweet taste; I think it was my fav roll! \n\nLast roll we ordered was the 3 Alarm Roll, it was spicy tuna, cucumber & avocado and topped with sauces, this one also packed some heat, but I was blown away with the Slamming Salmon Roll, I think it stole the show!\n\nSo now I will do some sushi making homework before I venture back, but I will be headed back for sure!
