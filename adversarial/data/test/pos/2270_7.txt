Well I called and asked for a reservation at 8-30. The lady said there was a table open now. I said I could not get there now and asked for 8-30. Again she said there was a table now and hung up. Perhaps this place is not very customer friendly. \n\nThat's the first time someone refused to give me a reservation..Quite amazing.
