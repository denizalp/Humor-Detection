Can't believe there aren't more reviews about this place.  Anyways, I lived here from November 2011-September 2012.   If you're considering moving into this apartment complex, take the advice that I gave the couple sitting with a leasing agent as I turned in my keys to move out...which was walk out the door and run away as fast as you can.    This place is a nightmare.  The people that work here are completely rude and condescending.   The people that live in this complex never seem happy.   I didn't see one neighbor smile in almost a year.   But It's not difficult to understand why.  The insides of these apartments are DEPRESSING.  I had a large floor plan, 2 bedrooms, 2 baths and you would walk into the place and the feeling can't be described.  The kitchen is small.  Everything seems \"closed\" and dark.  Everything is old and crappy.  And I was in a remodeled apartment.   I really couldn't have imagined walking into that place another day.  It's just such a sad way to live.  And I had one of the nice ones.   It's not like these apartments are cheap either.  I was paying $930 a month for rent.   I've moved into a MUCH nicer place in a MUCH nicer neighborhood and am paying almost $100 less, and the APS bill is 1\/2 what it was at Broadstone.   These people place the \"Scottsdale\" tag on the complex just to pinch more money out of you.  It's Phoenix, and it's the most overpriced dump in the area.  And don't get me started on the maintenance staff.  I told the people in the office 3 times my dishwasher was broken.  They came and \"fixed\" it.  They fixed it for a 3rd time, I came home, put a load of dishes in the dishwasher, left the house, and came back to my kitchen flooded with water.   That was the tipping point for me.   For the price, the experience, and nature of the whole place, I think a park bench in downtown Phoenix would be a better alternative than signing away a year of your life to these people.  They don't care about you.  \n\nOh, and by the way, my last month I had the option to either get them a Cashiers Check ($8 charge at my bank) or go through their online pay system which charges a $24 convenience fee.  Real nice.
