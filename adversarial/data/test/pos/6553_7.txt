I've had Hand Cut Burgers bookmarked for awhile. Came here on a Thursday night. \n\nAs I walk in my first thought is very trendy and modern looking bar. Has nice big booths and tables with the bar in the middle. Tv's above the bar and everyone watching Thursday Night football. I would say that the place is pretty loud with a lot of energy in the place. \n\nWe started out with the free salt & vinegar fries with a Yelp check-in and tempura Zucchini fries. Really good but everyone thought the zucchini fries were the best. Thick cuts of zucchini that was cooked perfectly. Soft in the middle and very tasty. The salt & vinegar fries were good too. I would say they were medium sized and nice and firm. Just how I like it. So I was a happy. \n\nI had the mushroom cheddar burger with an egg on top. The burger was good. Ok I guess. The bun was nice a firm. Burger was cooked perfectly. Nothing special. I would say good not great. \n\nMy wife ordered the chicken melt sandwich. Didn't try it but she said it was good. She only ate half and took the rest home. She didn't complain and that's good. Both my daughter and son got the California burger. They ate it all. Didn't complain. So I guess it was good. My son been here a few times so he does enjoy this place. \n\nService was pretty good. Our server was nice and friendly. Since this was our first time here, she explained their menu to us. She was pretty busy but still was able to fill up our water glasses. Only problem was that the kitchen was very slow. Took awhile for our fries to come out. It even longer for our burgers. We actually finished all our fries before our burgers came out. \n\nSo overall I really liked the ambiance. Loud, modern, trendy, somewhat hip, and relaxing. Friendly service with good food. Not great but good. Had better burgers but it's the experience. We enjoyed it. Hope you do too.
