I eat at Jimmy Johns at least twice a week if not more (the one off Gilbert road) this Jimmy Johns has quick delivery but the sandwich is never right! What's so hard about adding extra Oregano and no tomatoes? \n\nThe amount of lettuce they place on their sandwiches is way too much, come on guys it's a sandwich and not a salad! \n\nIf you can't get the basics correct on a week night when the store was empty then I'm not sure how well this location will do. Oh, and your employee Shawn is a complete tool! Rude, unprofessional and no customer service skills.
