I have always had positive experiences with renting from Enterprise whether if it is back in NYC or now in NC. Love the concept that they pick you up and with great customer service I might add. Especially, when your automobile is in auto shop for repairs or you are out of town and have no access to wheels.\n\nIf you by an airport, that is a whole other ball of wax cause there are shuttles to get you to the rental places which are close by the airport. But what if you are not situated by an airport then you are out of luck and cabs can be so costly.\n\nThe cars that we have rented from here have never had any issues and they are well maintained. You may be the lucky winner of driving a brand new 2015 model.
