Marcus was my sales person from this particular location but I never stepped inside the store. \n\nI recently purchased a new Bosch dishwasher from the Spencer. After I figured out which model I wanted, I contacted them via online to get a quote and Marcus responded to my inquiry on the same day.\n\nHe was persistent in following up with questions I had and set up a delivery and installation from their contractor. He was flexible when I had to change the delivery date, and he followed up by calling me on my cell, office phone and e-mail when I didn't respond to his message right away.\n\nDelivery and installation didn't go accordingly however I appreciate the thorough work they did. They get paid per job, not by the hour, so naturally they want to do as many as possible but when things went wrong, they stayed as long as it took to get the job right. What I originally thought would take 30 mins, ended up being 3 hours. They were not happy but stayed clam the whole time (or at least in my presence).\n\nWhen I need another appliances, I would come back to Spencer again.
