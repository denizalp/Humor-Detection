We were in the area for a friend's birthday scavenger hunt and needed a spot to continue the fun. Our friend arranged to get a table for the group and it only took the restaurant a few minutes to put this together.\n\nOur waitress was really great at handling a large group. She was quick to get drink orders started and out to the table. Our food orders didn't take long either. Our waitress was constantly at the table to make sure we had everything we needed. \n\nI went with a drink called Tranquil Waters and it was a delicious drink. My husband had the Zombie and he really enjoyed his drink as well. I know Margaritaville has a large emphasis on the drinks and I wasn't disappointed with the variety of options or quality of the drinks.\n\nFor food that night we had Volcano Nachos and Crispy Coconut Shrimp. The Volcano Nachos were huge. I think four or five of us shared this order and we still didn't finish it. The toppings were loaded on and it was a good bar food dish. The Coconut Shrimp was better than I expected and had a sweet and spicy sauce for dipping. The fries served with it were typical.
