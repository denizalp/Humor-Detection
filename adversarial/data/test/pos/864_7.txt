After my friend talked this place (and its hummus) up like it was Saddam Hussein's presidential kitchen, I was disappointed to find freeze-dry falafel wraps, humdrum hummus, and mediocre manakeesh. The food is simply not that great. My biggest criticism would be that everything was dry. There are great places for Middle Eastern cuisine in the GTA, and this just isn't one of them. On the bright side, it looks freaking fabulous.
