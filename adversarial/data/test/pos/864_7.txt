I have a few friends who've never had ramen and wanted to try it. Seeing this place has 4.5 stars, we gave it a try. What's weird is that the better ramen places have less than 4 stars here on Yelp and this place is highly-rated? My faith is officially gone.\n\nThe whole experience was a big mess and the ramen virgins would probably never eat ramen ever again. The service was horrible. The servers acted like they've never served anyone before. \"Hang on a second\" was used and abused by our server who needed a notepad for an order of Gyoza...that we were following up on. Our bowls of ramen came before our appetizers...one person in our group never got his ramen. They gave us soup spoons when we were already half-way done eating. We had to get up and get stuff ourselves because the servers were not attentive at all.\n\nThe ramen was just alright. The Cha-shu is thicker and has more flavor than other places. The Kara age was ok. The gyoza was fantastic...the only thing that was done right.\n\nThey put my friend's ramen to-go and comped it. They also offered to comp our drinks but we ordered water. So, thank you for not charging us water that was never refilled. Terrible!!!
