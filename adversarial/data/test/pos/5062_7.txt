Located deep inside the MGM hotel, we walked, and walked, and walked until we finally found the restaurant. The hostess welcomed our party of four immediately and graciously offered to take some photos of the group before showing us to our table. \n\nTouches of gold and crystal accessories give the posh dining room an air of surrealism, even for Las Vegas. Gem blues and purples set against a canvas of black and white set the stage for the grand performance. It took me several minutes to take it all in, and that's OK; I was having a moment as I looked around, while seated on a beautifully tufted purple settee.\n\nIt's a good thing I marveled at the decor for a bit; no one came to the table for a while which I thought was odd for this type of dinner. Finally, we requested to speak to the sommelier to get suggestions on French wine for our budget. When the somm came by, he replied that he had \"just the right one and would bring it over.\" I found it odd he didn't offer various options, but decided to trust him and let it go. After a good ten minutes or so passed, we inquired as to his whereabouts with a gentleman who stood nearby. Sure enough, the somm finally reappeared carrying a bottle of wine which we tasted and approved. Minutes later, the gentleman that helped us with the somm came by to icily take our order. By now, I must admit I felt annoyed. High-end restaurants with dismissive attitudes are not OK in my book. Proper? Yes. Pompous. No! I don't care how highly awarded you are. It's not OK. \n\nThankfully, the rest of the staff and the waitress who then took over for the remainder of the night saved the day! She interacted perfectly by delivering a professional, yet casual experience.  She spoke with us at length explaining every dish, answering any questions we had, and sharing stories. Given we spent a good three hours or so there, this mattered greatly.  \n\nThe food. Oh, the food. I, for one, loved it all and would return in a magical minute. Not everyone did, but I suppose they can get their own Yelp account and explain their side. \n\nIt's no secret this is an expensive restaurant. After all, Joel Robuchon is the most Michelin-starred chef IN THE WORLD. Naturally, before the Michelin Guide left Las Vegas, it had the very coveted three stars. As per my experience, it falls somewhere pricier than Eleven Madison (with a corkage fee) but less than Alinea\/French Laundry (with wine pairings). The menu offers four options base priced at $127, $169, $198, or $250 pp. Basically, you combine a different number of appetizers, main courses, dessert, and mignardises. There are some supplementary charges as well. TIP: The $169 menu seemed to be the best option. No dessert needed. I thought it was odd they added the (usually complimentary) mignardises as an option, until I realized why. More on that in a bit. While the menu offered the expected classic French fare, the picturesque and tweezer-happy plating steered closer to French techniques of today. \n\nWHAT I TRIED: Caviar & Salmon Tartar|Lobster & Guacamole|Truffled Langoustine Ravioli|Black Cod|Beef Ribeye|Plume of Iberico Pork|Souffle|Mignardises\n\nHIGHLIGHT: The langoustine ravioli with its foie gras sauce, I wish I had a ten of those. We all agreed, this was a winner!\n\nEvery menu included an amuse bouche. Once we placed our orders, bread service began. Not just ANY bread service. A cart with at least a dozen in-house freshly baked bread of all types rolled up. TIP: While it's easy to over-order (is there such thing as too much bread?) start slowly, the bread comes around often throughout the night. Once you choose, the butter cart appears. Of course, it does. French butter sliced individually and olive oil poured tableside, such a treat.  \n\nThe only dessert that appealed to me off the menu was the souffle. And while it actually delighted me- after all, it was perfect- I wish I would have saved the space for the grand finale: the mignardise cart. A stunning Wonka-esque display of sweets sat tableside, begging to be explored. I can't believe I'm admitting this, but I barely tried any. Darn souffle! It's probably my biggest regret of the night. Sigh. Because I happened to be celebrating my birthday, they also brought out a lovely and delicate complimentary meringue cake: adorned in spectacular pastel-colored rosettes and bearing a single candle. Happy birthday to me indeed! As a parting gift, every couple received a cellophane wrapped citrus butter loaf to take home, as a token of gratitude for visiting. \n\nDespite the rocky start, dinner lived up to my (very high) expectations, and I dream of returning. If you are serious about fine dining and new experiences, add this one to your bucket list. \n\nFor my South Florida friends, know L'Atelier de JoÃ«l Robuchon (the more casual concept) should be opening Winter 2017 (reportedly, alongside Jean-Georges Vongerichten's ABC Kitchen and Bradley Kilgore's new restaurant). Gasp! Winter really IS coming!
