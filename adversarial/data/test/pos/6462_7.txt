For the last decade, I have been feeling that the quality of sushi has plateaued in Montréal.  However, I'm now happy to report that Saikô has managed to reach new heights in Montréal sushi scene.  If you are old enough to remember the early happy years of Soto in the mid 90's, which at the time broke the grounds and set the trend of nouveau sushi (and its subsequent decline), Chef Yusa of the original St-Laurent Soto has returned to bring back these glory days with even more wisdom and finesse sans pretense of the late Soto.  His unexpected combination of flavors, eel, avcado, shiitake maki, or yuzu mayonnaise on top of crab maki wrapped by an infinitely thin layer of filo, etc., is simply mesmerizing.  But it just doesn't end there; he also has the freshest fish to create easily some of the best nigiris in the Northeast.  From the melt-in-your-mouth sweet shrimp from Greenland to generous cuts of hirame (sole), the cuts of the fish could stand alone by themselves with very little or almost no seasoning (although the chef painstakingly creates little drips of sauce for almost every other piece).  Who would have thought that we could taste the Hidaka kombu and scallops from Hokkaido on the restaurant table in Montréal, seriously? If you are a sushi lover, you have to taste his sushi to believe it!
