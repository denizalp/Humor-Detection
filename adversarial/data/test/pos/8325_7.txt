To start,was the chef was clearly on vacation because it felt like I was chewing week old black bean paste that had zero flavor that the chef squished between his butt cheeks before work. .. if you order a black bean burger, know you will be getting ONLY beans, dry, stinky, nasty beans! They were so dry, they were white on the inside..repulsive! \n\nThe pretzel bun was a sad story for the leftover bread they chose to throw on my fancy bean paste burger that was way over priced might I add.\n\nLast time I checked the aioli that came on the burger was supposed to have basil in it, now what came one my burger was a white water sauce.   Now I'm getting worried...\n\nCrunchy food service mushrooms are quite different than GMO FREE portables mushrooms. I get that you guys were short on produce but maybe you can order more? Or just don't lie. \n\nThe chef needs to LEARN how to cook a proper egg, any sunny side up egg that is brown on the bottom is enough of a reason for you to get your 'chef' title taken. Get back to school because grandma was wrong when she told you, you could cook!\n\nNOT GMO FREE. organic tomatoes and mushrooms are very different than the food service tomatoes mushrooms. There is a difference. Oh wait isn't that your selling point..? \n\nThen Our waiter thought that picking his nose the whole duration of our meal was the icing on the cake, or was it the crunchy mushrooms? Very dirty.\nThey call it tree huggers, I call it nose huggers!!\n\nTo end on a good note, SOME of the fries were crispy. I guess fries are all the chef can really handle making. \n\nIt's sad that people cannot even cook vegetables.
