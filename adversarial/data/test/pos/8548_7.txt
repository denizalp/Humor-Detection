I see a lot of complaints about the property management side of Wardley real estate, and it gives me a good chuckle. As a property owner I like to have things clean, organized, and done correctly and on time. Wardley Property management not only met my expectations as a property management company, but they also exceeded them. They got us rent on time, dealt with complaints, repairs, and tenants that I would have never had the patience to deal with. Honestly, would recommend this property management company any day. \nAs a real estate company I have referred Wardley to many friends and family and I have only heard raving reviews of the agents and staff. Would keep recommending the agents to all friends and family and when I buy any more property in Nevada I will not hesitate to us Wardley Real Estate.
