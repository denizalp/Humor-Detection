3.5! \n\nAll right... I don't know why Lee's gets such a bad rap. I grew up eating Lee's in NorCal and I will forever be faithful! I LOVE their sandwiches. Their bread is always so perfect, and both the Vietnamese and \"Euro\" sandwiches are good. Delicious chewy medium-quality meat, onions, cilantro... yum yum yum :) Lee's is so comforting and just brings back so many good memories. \n\nDon't get me wrong, obviously this is not going to be the best banh mi you've ever eaten, and not the best boba or Vietnamese coffee you've ever drank, but it is still so good. Lee's is like your Quiznos. Not the best sandwich you've ever eaten, but every now and then you get a craving that only they can satisfy. \n\nI was very excited to see a Lee's sandwich so close to the strip, and wow, I must say this location is HUGE, very CLEAN, open 24 hours, and has WIFI! How could you not like this place? \n\nI'd come to this location to study or get my quick fix of Vietnamese sandwiches. You can't really go wrong w\/ Lee's. Please give it a chance!
