This is the fourth location I've tried.  It's new, and clean and the food was good...\n\nThe \"show\" was not.  I think I get it.  We were put at a table with 5 junior high\/high school kids, and I don't know if maybe the chef thought...\"these kids are never going to appreciate the show...and even if they do they won't tip\" or what.  He cooked our food.  That's it.  My daughter was with us and she still loved watching it all unfold, but after he'd cleaned up for the evening, and moved to the next hibachi over from ours, we watched as he went through each and every trick I knew them typically to perform...out of the corner of my eye I saw him catch and spin the egg...then expertly split it over his spatula.  I saw him flourish his cooking implements, break out the little peeing plastic boy, light the volcano, flip food into people's mouths...etc.\n\nWe didn't get that treatment.  I get it.  Nobody relishes the idea of doing \"all that work\" and not getting the tip to match...but hey...that's your job, dude.  Make the most of it.  Do your best, put in the effort.\n\nThe food was good.  Really enjoyed it.  If it would have been less than good this would have dropped to a two.
