My trip to Tandoori Flame marks my first time in Brampton. Bramp Vegas is a tasty place, let me tell you... \n\nIt's far from downtown, but it isn't far from YYZ and my pale pal and I were returning a rental car. Two other buddies did us a solid and picked us up from dropping off the rental car. We were starving, and the always savvy Kent P had Indian buffet on the mind. So away we went. Four wasps buzzing west on the 401 towards a mecca of curry. \n\n$20 per head gets you AYCE of some of the best Indian food this tiny ginger has ever had on this continent. Their four types of paneer station lit up my heart and their goat saag was saagsational. I steered clear of the salad bars of pastas, etc, that looked reminiscent of my university cafeteria, but if you need to cut the eastern heat, they do have these more Canadian options. \n\nReally a lovely evening... in a giant buffet box... in a parking lot in Brampton. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For their colourful cocktail list. The watermelon mojito was A+ if you are looking for something sweet, refreshing and manly.
