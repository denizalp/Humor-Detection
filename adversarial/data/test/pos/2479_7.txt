I took the family there when I first got to the area back in December 2015. Food was really bad overall. The only exception was the egg rolls, which were pretty good. Tasted like you found really good egg rolls in a supermarket and then fried them at home. Service echoed others on yelp (dump food on table and don't come back). All of this and it's in a sketchy part of town... would recommend going elsewhere.
