Referred to by some a 'stodgy' with fine porcelain, silver, and lush fabrics to accompany formal service plus a cigar and cognac lounge my experience at Andre's began a few days prior with an E-mail to Ms. Jana Lane Southard requesting a copy of the menu plus a supplemental classic to the chef's tasting and with both requests granted to the tune of a small surcharge the dinner that followed was a true fete of three plus hours of near-perfect food and drink.  Noting up front that beverages were not requested, but instead comped to the tune of me leaving more inebriated than I'd prefer, it was to a glass of brisk bubbly that I was welcomed and proceeding next to the almost-too-rich-for-one \"Marti Foie\" with a quartet of accoutrements my palate was soon warmed with a gamy croquette serving notice of bold flavors to come.  Moving past mundane bread and frankly disappointing chilled butter it was with my upcharged request of demi-portion of Rochat's classic Thermidor that my tasting began and served in a high-arched bowl the only thing more impressive than the portion was the prep as the butter-poached crustacean proved snappy-sweet amidst a sea of cognac custard studded with tender vegetables and light aromatics.  Opting next for a caramelized seared steak of grade-A foie gras over savory fruitcake tinged with verjus and paired with Tokaji it was only course three that proved anything less than perfection as a slight over-sear dulled a freshly shucked scallop amidst flavors plucked from Robuchon, a small gaff not repeated in the plump sweetbreads or duet of duck - both amongst the most memorable preparations I've found in the state of Nevada.  Transitioning to cheese, an area where I think Andre's could certainly expand its selection, before an impressive palate cleanse it was at long last that a dessert long anticipated arrived; a tall and proud souffle with a tableside finish proving whimsy and perfection can indeed coexist as cocoa, cream, and cinnamon melded seamlessly into an ethereal pudding.  Rounding out the night with brandied cherries, chocolate, and a swig of cognac before settling the tab with a hefty tip it was with nothing but smiles that I exited Andre's; my only regret being that I'd waited so long to do so.
