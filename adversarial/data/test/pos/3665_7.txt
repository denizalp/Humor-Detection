I don't think Harlow's Cafe is a four star place, but I definitely would give it 3.5 stars.  It's your typical old-fashioned greasy spoon coffee shop with burgundy 1970s style naugahyde booths, movie posters and old photos, but heavy on your typical ASU\/Tempe crowd.  Harlow's makes you ask yourself the following questions.\n\nIs Burt Reynolds here?\nHow clogged are my arteries getting right now?\nWhy can't more breakfast places have this dated look?\n\nThe food and service were pretty good.  Our waitress hopped to it when we said we were in a hurry.   I ordered a breakfast burrito with ham eggs cheese (and a surprisingly spicy salsa) and minced hash browns and gobbled it up before you could say \"Dukes of Hazzard\".   Personally, I prefer my hash browns without all the extras.  I tried a bit of my brunch date's chorizo egg scramble, and it was a respectable effort of something I'm usually very critical of.\n\nIf you can, check it out on a weekday, go to the bathroom at home (unless you dig that cramped feeling).  I echo other comments on the priceyness of the entrees.  It's not a place I would go out of my way for, but it's worth a stop if you live nearby or are in Tempe.
