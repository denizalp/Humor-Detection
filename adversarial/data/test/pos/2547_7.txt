Horrible and expensive.\nThe pot stickers are clearly commercially produced and frozen, they have absolutely no flavor.\nThe duck basil was so spicy that you couldn't even taste the duck meat.  The tender beef was good, sadly there was 95% vegetables and no meat.  \nI am completely lost as to why this restaurant has a 4 star average
