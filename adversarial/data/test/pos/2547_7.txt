I hate this cvs with a fiery passion.  I can handle rude or I can handle incompetent, but the pharmacists here manage to routinely be both. On several occasions,  I have received the auto call to let me know a monthly refill was ready.  Arriving at the store an hour later, I'm told the prescription either isn't ready or I waited too long to pick it up (what?). Another time,  they shorted my husband's heartburn medicine by ten pills, then accused us of hoarding medicine.  Heartburn medicine? Does that suddenly have a street value???\nTrying to get a prescription filled here with a sick child in tow is one of the inner circles of hell.  Just give up. \nI hate you,  Cvs. I wish my insurance wasn't Caremark so we could break up forever.
