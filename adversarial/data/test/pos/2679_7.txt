Talk about korean style chicken wings that reminded me of family dinner growing up back home. I have had Bonchon bookmark for sometime now just never got around too it. But I found the perfect occasion on my birthday week celebrate with family. Obviously the chicken wings is the star at this show. Funny thing is ended up ordering the japache and the bulgogi sliders. Thankfully family ordered the wings so got to try wing one. They were awesome!!! Totally lived up to the hype for me. Not only did it remind me of my mom korean wings growing up for family dinner. The style is the thing that makes it stand out. Most part the norm is chicken wings in america deep fried, different concept breading, batter, and then mix it in the sauce goes on and on. The thing that really enjoy is the sauce or seasoning been marinade can really taste. It comes straight out right from the marinade into the deep fryer (maybe dry coating) and thats it right on the plate. NO need for extra sauce. The perfect crispy skin not only from perfect cooking time, the marinade with soy or sugar gives it more depth, and gets even more full crispy skin. Be warned the meat is HELL of hot once bit in. It so good. It nice moist cooked perfect. Just addicting that want eat more....\n\nI had full plate with two entrees. The bulgogi sliders was good. You get three per order. It nice full small size sliders. Really all the components complimented each other well. The bulgogi meat was cooked perfect and really could have bowl of the meat be happy. The japache it was solid but the least favorite dish I tried that night. The portion is nothing to complain about. NO doubt talk about hearty they have decent amount of bulgogi meat, lots of vegetables, and really if looking for noodle dish Japache solid choice. Just knowing the chicken wings are unreal good. I would stay clear of the Japache. \n\nThe service was awesome. We had big party seven everything went smooth that night. Service, never empty glass, explained the menu for half of us first timers, and asked if could split the bill into three separate checks never problem. Friendly. I like the fact on the menu every item there picture of that item. Just in case curious what it looks like get visual. Not many restaurants do that in this day and age. \n\nTalk about tiny. Inside not many seats but they do have an outside patio area. Since summer heat not sure the amount they use it or no one asks about it. So the place can fill up quick. \n\nWarning the $$ might be off especially if you get the wings. Honest they are kind of expensive just for wings, They come in different amounts that you can order. You're getting quality wings. It worth it!! I will be back again.
