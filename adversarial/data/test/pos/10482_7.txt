If you're on this side of town and need to buy some alcoholic beverages then by all means try to stop here.  The prices are much cheaper than your average ABC stores (I think b\/c it's on the South Carolina state line), but be warned get here early b\/c they close at 7PM...don't be like me and drive all the way here from the University area just to be mad as...well you get my point!\n\nThe selection here is huge!  I mean huge!  What you can't find at the ABC store you most definitely will find here.  They always have a tasting station where their showcasing the flavor for that day\/week\/month (they do ask for id to participate so have it ready).  If you can't find something then instead of walking to and from (b\/c this place is big) then ask...every time I have they have always know where to take me so the sales associates know the layout well.\n\nTheir are two prices on the sales sticker.  The \"Cash\" price and the \"Credit\" price.  The \"Cash\" price is cheaper but I have learned that if you use the Debit card option they will give you the \"Cash\" price.\n\nThere's two sides to this place.  The alcohol side and the Beer\/Wine side.  When you purchase something from either side you must first put it into your car before you can enter the opposite side (just wanted to give you heads up).\n\nOverall, definitely worth the trip!
