Really well laid out efficient sheetz. I really wish we had these back in ny! \nThe bathrooms were super clean and the kitchen area looked clean from what I could see.\nI had a great grilled cheese with ham and delicious mozzarella sticks. My friend got a burrito and she loved it. I got a great coffee in the morning there too. A lot better than you'd expect in a gas station haha.  Comparable to wawas.
