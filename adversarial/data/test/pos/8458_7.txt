Presti's is like the tourist trap of Little Italy- Its high profile location and sidewalk seating make it a must-stop for out-of-towners and those unfamiliar with the area. Is it the best bakery in Little Italy? That depends on which local you ask, but it does do plenty right and is a solid Italian bakery, nonetheless. \n\nI used to live on E. 120th a thousand years ago and back then, Presti's was a 24 hour hole-in-the-wall donut shop and institution in the neighborhood. Students from CWRU\/CIA, residents from UH, and the late night bar crowd all loved having the ability to pick up a dozen hot and fresh donuts in the middle of the night, myself included! When they relocated down the street, the donuts disappeared and the switch to normal business hours was made. I will forever miss this aspect of Presti's, though, so must dock a star out of principle alone. Yes, they really were that good!\n\nSo, anyway... the \"new\" Presti's is a pretty good bakery and lunch option. It's very popular and if you come during peak hours, be prepared to take a number and wait, though, the line does move fairly quickly. Along with their wide selection of cookies, cakes, pastries and breads, they also serve pizza, sandwiches, salads, paninis and other light fare. Their coffee is always hot and fresh, too! Grab a cup and enjoy your cannoli outside on the patio, if possible.
