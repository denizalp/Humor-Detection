Stayed here a little while ago for a night. Booked a regular room (~$250\/night) but was offered an upgrade for $100. The room I got for the extra hundo was truly massive, so big it didn't have a number... but a name! The staff was excellent and the cab I had scheduled was waiting for me as I checked out. Definitely a comfortable and very central place to stay if you're ever in Pittsburgh.
