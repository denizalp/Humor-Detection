Sorry, but their gelato is flavorless, the little flavor that is there tastes like cheap flavoring.I tried pistachio, chocolate, and their vanilla. Wound up throwing it away.. Not worth the calories. Even Gelato Spot, a chain, is better than this place. If you want the best gelato in the valley, hop up to north Scottsdale and go to That's Amore Gelato. You'll see how good gelato should taste
