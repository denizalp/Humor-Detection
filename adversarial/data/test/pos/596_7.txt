My rating is more for the staff employees than the food.    The Pizza, Antipasta, and Garlic Bread are wonderful.  For the food, I would say it's a great take out and even a dine in.  The place is casually decorated, kind of a sports theme, and pizza parlor.\n\nThe cashier helping the guests last night was wonderful, courteous, and very pleasant.  The rest of the staff looked like the grumpiest, family feuding, and couldn't smile if their life depended on it bunch.\n\nIn fact, there was one female working behind the counter wearing a white tshirt handling the salads and garlic bread, and she was the bitchiest worker there.  Everything she stated was a yell and a complain it seemed like.\n\nThey have a small bar, but my first impression was a little disappointed.  There was one patron there who made several failed attempts to joke with any worker passing by but all seemed to ignore him.\n\nAgain this is just my first impression...
