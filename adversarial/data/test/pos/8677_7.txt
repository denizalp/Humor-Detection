Its 2:45 am, after having a few drinks with friends needed to get something in the stomach and decided to stop at Waffle House. This fills the void of limited eating options late night \/early morning and most of the patrons here at this hour have the same need. Basic service, cookie cutter drab atmosphere with florescent lighting, and basic food but definitely fills a late night niche.
