Why do you smell so good...but feed me such mediocre waffles.\n\nI feel like I should like you.\nWe've been acquitted for so many years...\nYou have ice cream. ..But it's hard to screw up ice cream.\n\nI keep eating at your establishment because people keep asking me to go.\n\nI'm just being polite.\nI'll just smile and eat my cake.  \nWe'll pretend you are actually a good dessert cafe, even though you are usually a last resort when there is no other dessert cafe around.
