I'm only holding off giving a 5 star review until I return to have other things on the menu.\nWhen thinking of ways to describe my experience... A Dream... Delicious... Memorable... I'm so into this place.  First of all, it is absolutely adorable, buuut, Not pretentious, yet sumptuous and splendid.  I walk in and order right away.  I saw the pics of the Shrimp and Grit Cake and I was anxious to try that.  I was also interested in the Cucumber Gimlet...  both items were 5 star experiences for me.\n\nWhen I got the shrimp and grit cake, I thought, \"I think I need a spoon for all this gravy.\"  but I soon discovered, as you cut away from the grit cake, it actually soaks up all of that gravy --- NO spoon needed.  This may be one of the best tasting and the most aesthetically pleasing Shrimp and Grits I've ever had.  It was perfect.  From the grit cake gradually soaking up the gravy to the nicely spiced and suitable seasoning to the appropriately cooked shrimp... Every. Thing. About. This. Dish. Is. Perfect.\n\nThen the cucumber gimlet... simply perfection in a glass.\n\nI'm enjoying the old and new EXCELLENT gastro pubs around Phoenix.  Ten is proving to be a 10, indeed.  I plan to return soon.  I know my 4 Star will go to a 5 star.  Can't wait.
