Have you ever looked forward to grocery shopping? Have you ever squealed with delight thinking about pushing a shopping cart through congested aisles to stand in long lines after having fought to find a decent parking space? I swear, Trader Joe's makes me smile ear to ear and not find a glimmer of annoyance in any of these things that would typically make me fly off the handle. Why, you ask? Because Trader Joe's is a culinary wonderland, full of new and delicious possibilities, healthy and affordable deliciousness, with vegetarian friendly options a go-go. My life and my lunch are forever better for having a Trader Joe's in my life. \nThis was the first Trader Joe's location I had ever visited and it's still my favorite. The staff is incredibly helpful and kind and I know where everything is. But I still linger. I don't want to miss any of the new goodies they tuck in with my old favorites. My list of regularly purchased items continues to grow and my small trips to pick up basics now usually end up costing me well over $100. But for that cash I walk out of there with a cart full of things I'm actually excited about preparing and eating. I used to think I couldn't do all of my shopping here and would supplement my TJ runs with obligatory trips to Giant Eagle. Now the only thing I go to Giant Eagle for is the pharmacy. Chances are if Trader Joe's doesn't have it, I'm not eating it. I'd rather eat that canned tofu chili than my mother's best homemade effort (sorry mom, but have you HAD it?), the prepared veggie wraps and pasta salads are outstanding to have on hand for a quick lunch, and for a few months when the kale chips were removed from the shelves my wife and I talked about how we missed them almost daily. Our pantry\/freezer is nearly all TJ's brand and that's the way we like it.
