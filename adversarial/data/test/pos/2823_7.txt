12\/17\/09\n\nSaw that John Hill was holding a happy hour UYE and thought I'd check it out.  Haven't been back here since my first and only visit of what used to be Fine's Cellar.  I like what the new owners did with the place.  Unpretentious space.  I liked most of the dog art- I still can't appreciate dogs dressed in suits and playing poker, I'm sorry, but the psychedelic-prints are very handsome... I have one of a kitten at home, myself!\n\nHH apps menu is very reasonable here.  So reasonable, I spent about $50, with tip, on 3 glasses of wine ($5 each), 12 pcs. of bruschetta, fries ($3, I think), and chicken wings ($3 for 12)!  I'd skip on the ordinary chicken wings (which came w\/ jicama slices and ranch dressing) next time, but the parmesan fries are d'lish!  I must warn you that if you lack even an ounce of willpower, DO NOT order the bruschetta!  Especially not the Apples and brie, nor the Fig and mascarpone.  Oh. My. God!
