We went to Amy's for lunch today. The food and service were excellent. We started with the veggie and olive tapenade and cream of carrot soup. The bread served with both were awesome. The carrot soup and tapenade were also fantastic. \nOur main dishes were both salads. Yummy! We will definitely be back. (We also took some deserts \"to go\" and will devour them after dinner!)\nThank you, Sammy and Amy!
