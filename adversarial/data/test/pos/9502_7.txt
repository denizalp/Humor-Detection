I have to give a little back story about what brought us to this fantastic Phoenix eatery.  A group of friends and I formed a group called he Sunday Brunch Society, SBS for short, with the sole purpose to \"strengthen our friendship through regularly scheduled meetings.\"  We diligently drafted bylaws and have been successful in our first two meetings.  This was to be our third and it was my turn to choose the location.  I had heard about this restaurant having excellent brunch on several different occasions, so I decided to give it a try.  We were thrilled with the place and plan to come back soon.\n\nThere was a little wait for a table inside, but there were benches to use and we sat in an alcove of the outdoor courtyard.  Despite the chill in the air, we had a pleasant chat while listening to the live music being played by a Bohemian looking gentlemen on a guitar.  I would definitely recommend eating outside; just bring several layers of clothes if it is cold.  You can sit at tables scattered along the side and front lawns or on the porch, each with its own perspective of the old house the restaurant inhabits.  \n\nWe were seated near the front door, but the rush of people coming in and out from the small kitchen and coffee bar made me feel like we had come to the place where everyone wanted to be.  Both Shaina and I had a mocha latte that was delicious and super frothy.  The menu is limited, but we all had no problem in deciding that we were each going to try the sweet potato pancakes.  Great choice!  They were out quickly and steaming hot.  The price was reasonable, but not cheap.\n\nIf you have the \"urge,\" walk back to the bathrooms and check out the artistic renditions on the walls and ceilings along with the rumpled metal stalls.  They are a real work of art.
