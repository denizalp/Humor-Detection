Okay, so, we're from LA and a certain man I know *cough* was kinda obsessed with DogHaus, if you're familiar. So, I found this place which is very similar and also serves VEGGIE DOGS!!!!!!! HAPPY VEGETARIAN DANCE!!!!! See, everybody's happy. So, we walk in and there's only one person ahead of us. Points for fast service! \n\nEverything is reasonably priced. We ordered two hot dogs, a kids meal, a side of fries, and two drinks for $30. The fries are seasoned with some sort of witchcraft-y blend that is the perfect amount of salty and spice. Amazing. My fianc√© got the chili dog with a beef hot dog and said it was nothing short of spectacular. Apparently the lobster bun is also worth noting...... like 8 times. I ordered the \"brown dog\" with a veggie dog which was essentially a teriyaki stir fry on top of a veggie dog in a buttery soft bun! LORD IN HEAVEN. I cannot. The carbs. But so good. So, so good. We got the kids corn dogs for our 4 year old son and he  also gobbled that shit up. \n\nOkay, suffice to say that the food is friggen awesome. The cashier was also super friendly and the service was fast! I have no complaints, only happy-warm-fuzzy \"I'm not even gonna eat dinner tonight because lunch was so good\" feelings. That is all.
