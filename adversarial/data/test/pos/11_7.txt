This Tim Horton's is located inside the Metro, it is a very small area in the corner of the store, by the doors from where you come inside. There is usually only one person working so at times it can be busy and slow. It is a very limited selection in this store, a lot of things they do not carry and some things like doughnuts are only small quantities.
