Cafe Milano makes one enormous and enormously savory pie, one that has a puffy, doughy outer edge, generous toppings, stretchy, velvety cheese, and a piquant, but mildly sweet sauce that will have you thinking of it for days and days. \n\nOn a recent visit, Kay, myself, and some friends took on an extra large (16 cuts) pizza platter that was embellished with gorgeously, scrumptiously caramelized bacon and red onions. A tremendous pizza that stands on a platform above many in the area, it comes strongly recommended from me, a man who eats far too many of them. \n\nWhat underwhelmed me were the brown, overdone fries, which also came off as bagged and frozen and not at all properly freshly cut. \n\nWhen we dined here, the upstairs dining room was buzzing with activity and packed with hungry customers. The poor staff, including our kind and incredibly photogenic server, were almost overcome by the deluge of commerce on an insanely busy Friday night. Despite that, the service was on-point for the most part, our waitress earning herself a hefty tip for what might as well have been combat pay.
