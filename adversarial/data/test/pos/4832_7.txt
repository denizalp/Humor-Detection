In my honest opinion, the one located in Eaton Centre near McGill University (Nudo) is much better than this one. I mean, this is supposed to be your main store, but how can it be so much worse than the one in Eaton Centre?\n\nThe pork ears I had were actually dry, meaning that they were prepared days before and wasn't served and not properly stored either. The noodles are not hot when served, and they were to undercooked for a La Mian (). They were not \"Al dente\", they were UNDERCOOKED...my jaws went sore from the chewing I had to do to eat those \"noodles\". The soup was just bland, and had nothing special in it.\n\nThe service was not what I had in mind; my water was never filled, and the waitress never came either.
