Tired? Hungover? Sick from a long night? Need a place to hit up in the morning which can provide you with a sound breakfast?\n\nWeakling.\n\n\nWell whatever the case is, Le Neuf Cafe is a great way to start your day. They have an amazing brunch, beautiful outdoor seating and great hospitality. The staff and owner are super friendly.\n\nThe food here is great and fills you up. You can survive half a day on a baguette alone. \n\nLocated right in Clarence Square it's a great way to enjoy a lovely day when it's nice outside.
