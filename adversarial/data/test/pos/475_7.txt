This property is poorly managed. Management has flat out lied about lease rates. Roommates who went to re-sign a lease were told a lower price never existed when we had e-mails offering the rate.\n\nManagement also thinks that they have free reign over your privacy. We literally just had a maintenance worker and part of the \"management staff\" walk into the apartment uninvited, walk half-way into the apartment \nnot saying a word to us and talking to eachother, and then walk out.\n\n\nIt sucks that there is not a whole lot of options for students around the university.
