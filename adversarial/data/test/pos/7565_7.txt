This place is pretty awesome.  They recycle people's appliances by fixing them and selling them at reduced rates or they safely recycle them elsewhere if they are unfixable.  I came in looking for replacement fridge drawers because the ones in my fridge were broken and my landlord wanted to charge me $200 for new ones(!).  I looked online and could find nothing for less than that amount.  After going to Construction Junction and being told they send all of their fridges to Appliance Warehouse, I tried it out.  Granted, it's a little bit \"rough\" in the sense that it's a pretty dirty place and every employee there seems to smoke in the actual store itself, but it's worth it for the savings.  I ended up spending $20 on both drawers...huge savings for me and a win for them as they probably would have had to recycle the drawers and spend money on them versus making money from them.  Also, I put myself on a waiting list for a portable dishwasher which normally retail at $400 and they sell them for around $150.  Pretty awesome (if it works!)
