If you can get in...which is a huge pain given all the retirees who line up here at crack of dawn..I'd recommend it.  They have a great variety of breakfast options and I got the french toast which was delicious.  Service was very good as well. It is just too hard to get in and when you are hungry waiting 30 minutes not good.  If you don't mind the wait, I'd check it out.
