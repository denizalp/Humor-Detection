WOOO free tram ride :]\n\n\ni would like to think that this was made especially made for girls like me who are limping by the end of the night because we wear \"really cute shoes\" that hurt like hell.\n\nthank you mandalay bay-excalibur tram! you make that morning walk back to the hotel manageable. lifesaver!
