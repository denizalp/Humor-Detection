My waitress was very sweet - I appreciated that she mentioned that my dish had peanuts in it, even though that is almost the only thing I'm not allergic to.  Stupid allergies.\nAnyway, the space is lovely, if you have your back to the entrance, you might forget you're in a Vegas casino.  \nI had the kung pao chicken and it was delicious!!!  $17 delicious?  Probably not.
