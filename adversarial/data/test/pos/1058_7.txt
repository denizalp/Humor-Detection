YES.\n\nIf you have time to dig and aren't put off by the oft-unpleasant olfactory sensation of THRIFT, come here. Sometimes it's a bust, but I usually leave with something, if only a basic silk tank for $0.60. I've found everything from '60s Dior skirts to Eileen Fisher to Club Monaco to Theory. BE WILLING.\n\nAnd now they have try-on rooms, so you don't have to shimmy in and out of potential purchases in full view of the store! 20% for senior citizens & students, too. Divine.
