HELLO TORONTO!!! I am impressed! I just attended my FIRST Toronto Yelp UYE last night and what a way to kick-start the NEW YEAR with a BANG!  Feeling like a Yelp virgin, all over again, I walked into the venue with my sidekick, Mark T., and met some fabulous Toronto Yelp Elites! As always, super friendly, and loads of fun, THIS is why they are \"Elite\" status! Made me feel like I'd been hanging with them for eons! First of all - a shout out to SUSAN G. and DISHAN W. - THANKS for organizing it! I was all smiles, all night!\n\nLocated just at the corner of Dundas St. W & Ossington, this new baby is only a couple of months old! I feel so COOL to be in-the-know! Upon entering, I was immediately impressed by the trendy space, with funky pendent lights hanging amidst the dimly lit interior. Very cozy, and a reasonably quiet atmosphere for an appetizer-slash- drinking spot! \n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is an American SNACK bar. Dishes are meant to be small tasting dishes, so be prepared to order more than 1 dish to fill up! We were a table of 8, and it was a challenge to determine how to go about ordering food! Dishes ranged from $5 - $30. The average dish was around $6, and you will receive 2-3 small pieces on each dish. As a large group, we opted for ordering 3 of every single item on the menu (minus the $14 lobster roll and $30 steak and eggs dish). It was enough to make all 8 of us feel full without falling into a food coma!\n\nTHE HIT LIST:\n\nSALT COD - like a tofu rice baggie, but stuffed with moist steamed rice, mixed with sesame seeds, inari, nori kewpie, and tiny pieces of cod - MY FAVE! \n\nDEVILED EGGS - soft boiled eggs, topped with nori flakes, sesame, and a hint of hot sauce? Creative! \n\nPORK SSAM - large bitter lettuce wraps topped with grilled juicy pork & marinated corriander. Simple & Light!\n\nPORK ADOBO - soft tacos with marinated veggies and soft chewy pork meat drizzled with pork fat and oils. Finger-licking goodness! (Oh! Ask for a hand towel in advance - you'll thank me later)\n\nIt was like have an innovative\/creative party in your mouth all night long! WELCOME BACK INDEED!!!  \n\nYours Truly is SINCERELY an awesome place to drink & eat & have a gabfest!
