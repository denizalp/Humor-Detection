re: vacation\n\nSo there is a short line to get in.  I'm not too surprised, but if you ever been to any other pawn shop, this one is extremely nice (of course, right?  they have to, because of tv.)  Their prices are a little more than you'll find at most other pawn shops, but that's to be expected given the amount of traffic that goes through there.  I thought their higher end stuff had some fair prices.  Certainly if I were in the market for a Rolex watch, I would definitely buy it from here.  The reason being is that I'd be very confident that this place isn't going to screw you over so that it can maintain it's reputation.  \n\nBiggest surprise for me was how small the area where the 'Old Man' and Rick sit.  Camera definitely makes that area look bigger than what I saw.
