I've now stayed here for the second time and I'm a fan. I think my first time was better because they didn't yet assess a resort fee ($15) and there wasn't construction going on, but for the money it was still a great value. I love the fact that it's an all-suite non-gambling and non-smoking hotel. They also allow pets, which is pretty awesome. The rooms are huge and well-appointed and my friends and I save a lot of $$ by trucking in our own stuff. Plus, it's just around the corner from our usual hang: Ellis Island Casino and Brewery and a short walk from the new LINQ area. The staff is very friendly and helpful and I really enjoy staying here. Their pool area is pretty nice too, usually very relaxed. Mandatory valet parking can be kind of a pain at peak times but it's not too bad. \n\nSTEPH JUDGEMENT: A great off-the-strip value.
