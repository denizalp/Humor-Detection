The service department is sexist. If you have a vajay expect them to talk down to you, belittle you and try to sell you shit that you don't need. All the times I have been there I have not even seen one woman working in the service department.\n\nI walked right out as soon as I realized he was treating me different because I sit down while taking a piss. I know Az is a red state and all and you like your women all oppressed but you are losing customers.\n\nMy husband and I both wouldn't be back.
