There is a reason why the word Best is in the name Best Funeral Services & Chapel. They truly are the best.\n\nMy father died unexpectedly and I didn't have any experience in funeral homes. After meeting with a large funeral home chain, I knew that wasn't the direction I wanted to go. I found Best Funeral Services online and that same day I was able to meet with Julia Ramirez. Their packages were simple and very straightforward. No hidden fees like the other funeral home. Julia was very empathetic, professional and sweet during the entire planning process. I highly recommend her, she is like a friend a friend to me now.\n\nTheir prices were also about 40% cheaper than the big funeral chains. I recommend to skip over the big chains and go straight to Best Funeral Services, and I found out that Best is also family owned.\n\nTheir employees are wonderful and professional, the chapel is beautiful and there isn't any pressure. This is what you need when you are dealing with an unexpected death in the family.\n\n--Andrea
