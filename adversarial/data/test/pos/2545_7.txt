This is the worst place you could possibly go to get food. Place is run by convicts who were placed here to have a job. You can tell they really don't care how fast they get your food out.\n\nThey are constantly out of Whoppers especially on SUNDAYS AT LUNCHTIME. Part of me thinks they just don't want to serve people. Whoever is in change of this place needs to be fired. They don't even clean the place.
