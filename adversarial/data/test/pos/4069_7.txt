\"Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.\"―William Shakespeare\n\nLittle Miss BBQ (LMB) has been on my radar since I first spotted the glowing Yelp reviews after my last trip to AZ; I saw the 5-star Yelp average, but figured it wouldn't hold up for long. Lo and behold, as I was researching places to eat on this trip LMB again entered my sights, and I was shocked to see that they had still held onto the 5-star avg and with well over 600 reviews! LMB had suddenly become a \"must go.\" After reading some reviews I noticed that the crazy-long lines seemed to be a consistent pattern; my flight was scheduled to arrive at 10:20 a.m., and --seeing the close proximity of LMB to PHX-- I knew if we were on time, and moved quickly, we could be there before, or right when they opened. After landing, my Navy SEAL-like precision put us in line at approx 10:55 a.m.--5 min before opening, but the line was already about 30-40 folks deep. There are few things in this world I'll wait more than 20 min for, but 5-star BBQ is one of them. It took almost an hour to make it through, but it was worth every second...\n\nMeat:\n\nPulled Pork- This might've been the most disappointing of all the meat here at LMB; the smoke was a bit muted, and the rub was lacking but it was still juicy. The lack of flavor was nothing a little sauce couldn't cure. 3*\n\nTurkey- Surprisingly excellent Smoked Turkey! The meat was tender, juicy and just the right amount of smoke to not overpower the delicate flavor. Even my sister (the pickiest eater I know) loved it! 4.5*\n\nRibs- Amazingly tender, smoky and just the perfect amount of rub. No sauce needed for these bad boys. They were so friggin' good I ate the little cartilage pieces at the ends of the ribs... 0_o 5*\n\nFatty Brisket- My goodness... I can't even think of words to describe the heavenly experience that is eating LMB's Brisket. Smoky, Juicy, Beefy... Bah! Mere words cannot describe this humbling experience. All I'm going to say is it's better than my homemade version, and we'll leave it at that. 5* \n\nSides:\n\nBeans- I almost passed on the beans and got the 'slaw--until I talked to the guy serving up the meat and he told me they use the trimmings and juices from the brisket to make their beans! All I can say is, \"Wow...\" Seriously the best Bean side dish I've ever had at a Q joint. Smoky, beefy, slight sweetness and the beans were cooked to perfection. 5*\n\nJalapeño Cheddar Grits- Pretty good rendition of this classic southern dish. The texture of the grits was on point and plenty of cheese, but I felt like it could've used more jalapeño flavor. It was a bit muted and needed that kick! 3*\n\nBekke's Secret Pecan Pie- I'm not sure if the name is refers to the secret recipe, or that it's not listed on LMB's wall menu? Maybe both?! Regardless, it's still a pretty cracking Pecan pie! Not too sweet and a nice flaky crust make this a must-get! 4.5*\n\nService & Ambiance- Located in a mostly industrial area LMB's surroundings leave much to be desired, and their parking lot is waaaay too small to accommodate their popularity. However, there is plenty of street parking close-by. All the employees were terrific; friendly, good-natured--and not stingy on the goods!! 3*Ambiance\/5*Service\n\nValue- Pretty standard high BBQ pricing, but their giant servings make you feel like you're getting a good deal. 4*\n\nMy only qualm with LMB is their wait times, as you really do need to sacrifice about two hours of time between the waiting and the eating. And that's not to mention if you wanted some Q in the AZ summer! If I lived in the area this would --unfortunately-- be a weekend only experience. So, other than the wait, LMB gets a rare 5-star BBQ review from me. Highly, highly recommended!!!
