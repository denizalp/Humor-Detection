Zaffron is a good restaurant, been there for as long as I can remember..so that certainly tells you that they're doing something right!\nparking is a little challenging, you'd have to park in the back, because parking at Yonge Street is nearly impossible!\nThe place is nice, but it lacks that special touch, it's very \"blah\"! although they some times have music, but still...it always feel empty and deserted for some reason.\nThe food is good, but certainly not my first choice when it comes to Persian restaurants. If you haven't tried it yet, it's worth a visit or two..
