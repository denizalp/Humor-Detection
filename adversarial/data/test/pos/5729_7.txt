A good place to grab a meal then head to Whole Foods to shop sensibly. It was very busy on a weeknight around 730p. I had the quarter chicken meal with a sangria. The chicken choice is either white or dark. I tried the white and I got a whole breast and wing. It was delicious! Moist, tender and well seasoned. To some people, I can see the chicken being too salty. I liked it and I would definitely order it again. The meal comes with two sides - I had the fries (the battered kind so I know they're bought) and green beans (soy and ginger maybe?) Overall, the meal got expensive with the sangria but it was large and strong enough to be worth it. Give them a chance!
