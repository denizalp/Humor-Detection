Patties, \n\nWhat in the hell are you doing in Old Town Scottsdale? I am just really having a hard time understanding this concept, and the fact that you are hidden in between a bunch of wak ass overpriced boutiques that sell things not even my grandmother would buy is beyond me. But you know what, lets get past that for a minute.\n\nI visited you on the day I returned from my last Houston trip. I was DD, so therefore I REALLY got a feel for what you are like like without any alterations, and even got annoyed, because there is really nothing more irritating than being tired and jet-lagged and watching everyone else get saucy while you inhale Marlboro lights to keep your shit cool. Entertaining to say the least though.. especially the part where some huge dude thought it would be a good idea to eff with the hanging space heater that I was afraid was going to fall off the wall at any second while yelling at his \"bitch\" to shut up and put on a sweater. Or the owner, who comes outside, sits down, lights a cigarette and doesn't take one goddamn puff of it, NOT ONE. Just lets it burn while he kicks up his feet.. I'm certainly not one to spend $7 on a pack of cigarettes I don't intend to smoke, but hey, different strokes for different folks. You have pool tables, and darts, and random ass sports and western shit hanging up everywhere.. But lets talk about the bathrooms... As a woman, sitting on a public toilet seat is one of the most repulsive things in the universe.. so you geniuses decided to install handle bars in front of us, so we can hold on while we hover.. I have never seen this before, and I appreciate it. Especially since the stalls are tiny. I will appreciate it even more when I cannot stand correctly and am falling all over the place trying not to sit on the pee infested seat next time I am there. \n\nYou have wonderful whisky, which makes me an auto-fan, full bar, and lots of beers to choose from. Your service was decent and you're not the cleanest joint in the neighborhood but dudes, I understand you're a DIVE. So thank you for being just that. \n\nP.S. Let me remind everyone that they shouldn't enter you thinking its going to be like every other Scottsdale bar.. this my friends, is truly for those of us who don't give a shit about aesthetics and just want to drink.
