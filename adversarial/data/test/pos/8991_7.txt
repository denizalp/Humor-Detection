What can you say? It's the Post Office. I live right around the corner from this location, so I'm here on a semi-regular basis. I think its fair to put the Post Office in the same category as the DMV. That being said, I think some of these 1 star reviews are being a little harsh. If you come to the Post Office expecting 5 star service like you would expect at the Bellagio, than you are just plain nuckin' futz. The employees are marginally friendly, just don't ask too much of them.\nI can't say I've ever had a horrible experience with them at this location.\n\nThere was this very annoying thing that happened yesterday though. I got home from work yesterday with a notice in my mailbox notifying me that I had a piece of mail with insufficient postage from \"property management\" and that I would need 0.46 to retrieve it. Okay. I go there to pick up the item thinking \"Wow! My HOA has really gotten cheap\". I wait in line and when it comes time to pick up the item, it ends up being one of those ads\/flyers that go straight from my mailbox to the garbage can outside of the house. Ummmmm, whaaat?? You want me to pay 0.46 , waste my gas and time driving to the PO, and than wait in line for THIS??! I dunno what moron thought this was cute, but I wasn't amused.\n\nRant aside, its the Post Office. What do you want?? Friendly, competant service with a smile? Hahaha Wake up, Dorothy! You're not in Kansas, sister. It is what it is....and I've been to worse....much worse..\n\n2.5 stars...\n\nbut I'm a nice guy, so I give them 3....for now..\n\n\nOpen from 8:30am-5:00pm Monday-Friday\n                  9:00am-3:00pm Saturday
