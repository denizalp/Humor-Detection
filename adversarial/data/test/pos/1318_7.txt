The food was excellent! I enjoyed a fresh and tasty salad appetizer which went well with the complimentary variety bread basket. Main entree was the pan seared sea scallops...very fresh!...but a little undercooked for my liking. I enjoyed the house Pinot noir with dinner, and I couldn't resist dessert as well! \n\nThe banana cream pie dessert is awesome!! Delicious, light, filling. I'll get it again next time I'm back!
