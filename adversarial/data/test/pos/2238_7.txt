Having wanted to try the original downtown LA location for the longest time, and just never getting the chance to, Public School 702 was probably one of my more anticipated restaurant openings this year. This new location in Downtown Summerlin sits on the upper level between Crave, and the yet to open second Shake Shack. It's a pretty large space with a lot of seating, a good size bar area, and an outdoor patio as well. But even with all that, it gets busy, and you'll likely have to wait for a table. For just 2 people at 7:30 on a Wednesday night, the wait still tipped 30 minutes.\n\nAfter being seated, we were handed their regular notebook style menu that has a quite a few appetizers, and all kinds of entrees from burgers to chicken and waffles. We were also handed a separate list of their current rotating tap beers. That's one of my favorite parts about PS702. Not only is there \"normal\" beer list all craft offerings, but their rotating stuff seems to be filled with unique and even some hard to find limited release stuff. If you're not a beer drinker though, they've got plenty of cocktails and wines too.\n\nSince there was only 2 of us and pretty much every appetizer on the menu sounded good, we decided to get a few items to share, and then split one dinner. We started off with some of the smaller items, the Speck & Eggs, and the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. At just $6 for either of these, they are must try starters in my opinion. The eggs were perfectly boiled, had a creamy yok filling, and the little piece of proscuitto was a nice salty, crispy touch. And the buffalo cauliflower was excellent. We've had a few different versions of it at other places in California, where it seems to be more popular, and PS702's was excellent. It's got a thicker breading and was served piping hot with sauce on the side, instead of tossed.\n\nThe other appetizers we tried were a little on the bigger side. Their Mezze Plate is huge for $8 and includes 5 different things to pick off or dip in, and huge stack of thin, crispy pita-like bread. My favorite things were the marinated feta, and something I had never had anywhere else before, crispy chickpeas. We also really enjoyd the Chorizo Mac & Cheese. It was the most expensive starter we got at $9, but well worth it. The pasta was cooked perfectly, it's super cheesy, there's plenty of chorizo in it, and even though I thought it was strange at first, the salt and vinegar chips on top added both flavor and texture.\n\nBy this time, we were pretty full, but our order of the Fried Jidori Chicken & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles was already on the way. Sadly, it didn't impress nearly as much as the appetizers, especially with it's $22 price tag. I personally really liked the slightly spicy waffle with the cornbread like texture, but the wifey wasn't a fan. And even though the flavor on the chicken was excellent, it was mushy and only one part, a leg, was bone-in. The gravy had good flavor as well, but because the chicken was soggy, it made the whole dish just overly mushy. Had the chicken been crispy, this would have been a huge hit for me.\n\nUnlike a lot of the other reviews, our service was excellent. We even found out later on during our meal that our waiter was in training. He did an excellent job though, and no complaints from me at all in the area.\n\nPS702 is a little on the pricy side, especially when you get drinks, but it's not out of this world crazy. With both of us getting drinks, then adding on 4 appetizers and a main entree, we only spent about $90 with tip. Besides the main chicken and waffles dish being a bit of a let down, it was well worth it, and I've got to say PS702 is one of my new favorites in Downtown Summerlin, so I can't wait to go back.
