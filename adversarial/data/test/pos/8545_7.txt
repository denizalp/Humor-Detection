*Tequileria Grill*.. clever name for this Mexican Bar-Restaurant! \n\nI dropped by here last weekend after seeking some drinks upon arrival into Las Vegas, while waiting for my ride. \n\nThis is located inside the McCarran International Airport near Gate C7 which is perfect for those looking for a full bar, or Mexican food as this has it all. \n\nDRINK: *Ultimate Margarita*... Cadillac Margarita.. MmMMm ;D\n\nThe server had awesome service with his attentiveness and also gave us space which was a good impression. The atmosphere is great and I would recommend this for those curious about this Tex-Mex spot. 4 Stars.~
