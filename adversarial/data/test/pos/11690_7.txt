WHAT A JOKE!! I would give this a NEGATIVE 4 STARS if Yelp would allow it!!! \nI should send the AZ Republic a bill for my time and gas driving all the way out here to this \"new\" breakfast place in Mesa. This place was described as a \"slice of heaven\" in East Mesa... should have been \"slice of mommy & daddy buy spoiled child a business\"!!\nI am so disgusted I don't know where to start!!\nFirst of all, the AZ Republic reviewer, John Stanley should be ashamed of himself for the false advertising and misleading advertising of this review...  what a disservice this review has proven to be as well as ruining this reviewers reputation!  The only conclusion I can come to is this was a PAID REVIEW as there is almost NOTHING in the review that was accurate.\nSecondly, breakfast is only served until 10:30am even though their VAST menu is only 4 items, consisting of:  Sunshine on a Cloud (takes 15 minutes of preparation), Biscuit & Gravy, Sausage or BOLOGNA Biscuit, Fruit & Granola Yogurt Parfait.  \nThe Az Republic reviewer glowingly described the Sunshine on a Cloud so we ordered it... took 40 minutes to get even though we came @ 10:15am when there was only one other couple there. Could never get a clear answer as to why it took so long to cook but it was HORRIBLE just the same. The muffin was stale and dry and the yolk so overcooked it was like a hard boiled egg. When we pointed this out to the waitress, she apologized but stated because breakfast was no longer being served I couldn't get it made over. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\nWhen this waitress realized I was getting upset, she pathetically offered to allow me to offer something off the lunch menu if I wanted as a replacement.\nThird ~ the EXPANSIVE 6 item lunch menu consisted of:  Chicken, Egg, or Ham Salad, Meatball, Grilled Cheese or PB&J with the offering of a side salad or soup.  Personally I don't eat pre-made \"salad\" sandwiches ~ unhealthy and all made with mayonnaise. I've never liked meatball, and the \"kid friendly\" grilled cheese and PB&J... I would never buy at a restaurant ($3.99) when I can make these at home for 20cents!!  I passed on the lunch offering and was still charged for the breakfast!!\nFourth, according to the reviewer the bakery goods is what attracts the near\/far travels of customers... well ... they were out of the cake. No pies today. The 2 lonely bars in the case looked like they were days old. The mini-cookies looked decent (the size of your thumb) but the price of $2.99 per dozen stopped me cold.  No bread today, but I could special order the waitress stated. and the muffins... well I had one on my breakfast and it was stale and dry, so no to that as well.\nTHAT'S IT!! That is the entire menu...  \nFifth... the hours for serving breakfast are ridiculous!! You are only open until 2:30pm daily and you only serve breakfast until 10:30am?? Your breakfast menu is only 4 items and your lunch menu is only 6 items and 5 of the 6 items are all scooped out of a container onto bread....  I know, overwhelming preparation!!\nDO NOT waste your time on this place and along with the other NEGATIVE REVIEWS posted on this site, I don't give this place another 2-3 months before the East Valley is rid of another \"overpriced, horrible food, & daddy's girl needs a hobby\" restaurant!!
