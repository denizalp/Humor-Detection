When I have a rough day, I tend to reward myself with a nice bottle of brown for my growing collection. When I have a fantastic day, I tend to reward myself with a nice bottle of brown. I just reward myself with a nice bottle of brown pretty often. Although their competitor tends to sell some of the items cheaper, it is not always in stock. My luck tends to be better at Lee's. I have been able to find Yamazaki, Hibiki, Nikka, and Eagle Rare at Lee's. Yes, I have been greeted with disappointments and walked out with nothing before. Most of the time though, I am able to find something new to try. For the most part, I have been satisfied with this Lee's. I am just dissatisfied with how quickly they raise their prices. I got a bottle of Hibiki 12 year for $65 one week and now it has gone up $5.
