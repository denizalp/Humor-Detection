I have to eat at Cravings whenever I'm in town.  I don't care how hung over I am, or how much money I've lost, I will eat prime-rib, eggplant parm, sugar-free hazelnut gelato, sushi, sugar-free cheesecake, crab legs, fried shrimp, fried chicken, sausage, ham, bacon, smoked salmon, meat n' cheese, and salad.  If you think that's gross, you should catch me when I'm not on my diet.\n\nThe last time I was here, my friend Cynthia and I never actually dined together.  It was more of a tag-team (not the Whoomp! There it is! kind).  Somehow, whenever one was eating, the other was going up for more food.  Next time, I'll be the 2 plates-at-a-time kind of girl.
