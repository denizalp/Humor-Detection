YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(169\/365) \"Soba Addiction\"\n\nI guess its a good thing they were out of the Katsu-Don on one of our most recent visits, otherwise I would have never known how good the Chirashi Bowl was! That Salmon Oshizushi is also so tasty and I'm glad I also gave that a try instead of going for my usual Battera fix.\n\nService here has always been top notch and you don't have TV screens, music blasting, or obnoxious patrons here so you can totally enjoy your meal here without any unnecessary distractions. Everything I have ordered here throughout the years has been great and I have no complaints.\n\nAnother piece of perfection besides the chef's soba(No one in town does it better than I-Naba) is his rice. Often overlooked in some Japanese establishments, but not here...spot on each and every time.   ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5
