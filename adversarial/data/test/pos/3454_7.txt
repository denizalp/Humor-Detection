This place deserves NOTHING. NO STARS. \n\nSeated right away at a high top table by the bar with uneven seats that drive me nuts. Potato skins to start off were ok. Date ordered a cup of tomato bisque which was watery. Timing of serving the appetizers could have been alot better, soup was finished way before the skins arrived. We both ordered the two deluxe burgers with fries. When they arrived they were as specified. Major problem I'm still trying to figure out is the beef used for the burgers. Upon cutting the burger in half to eat it the juice had already soaked the bun and made it soggy. We both requested medium, however the meat was cooked, but in a really odd way. While you would expect some pink to a burger when ordering it medium, there was no pink whatsoever. It was a thorough brown. Wasn't well done or burnt at all. The taste was rubbery and bland and hard to swallow due to all of the cheese, soggy bread and really odd texture of the beef. So I picked the burger apart and discovered the patty to have this even line through the middle that split the patty directly In half. I guess the only way to describe this is if you took one party, flattened it, then do it again with another patty and combine the two. The weirdest thing. After that combined with the taste I highly suspect the meat was of the microwaveable variety. Didn't finish what was left of it after that. Fries we're mediocre at best. Was expecting fresh cut fries like there \"sister restaurant AJs Urban Grill\" but was met with store bought crinkle cut fries. AJs was no better. Food disappointing to say the least. Do not plan on returning. Especially after some halfwit jackass stood directly next to our table to watch the tv above us, why he couldn't watch the tv that was DIRECTLY ABOVE HIS TABLE SHOWING THE EXACT SAME THING is beyond me.
