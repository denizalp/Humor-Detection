I'm a local so maybe its not appealing to those like me. \n\nCouldn't take the crowdimg, no room to dance anywhere. A bigger guy like me, can be very uncomfortable. \n\nI have XM so the music does nothing to me, but I guess the Top 40 stuff is good for those who don't listen to a lot of music.\n\nSorry, I don't care if its the strip....I cant get with $11.00 watered down cranberry and vodka. You'll never win with that. \n\nMaybe one day there will be a club on the Strip not so pretentious and overhyped.
