I love this Keg - you may think it's not as ~*KEWL*~ or AWESOME as the ones downtown, but you would be wrong.  \n\nI don't know what kind of Rob Ford brand crack they put in our food last night, but it was amazing.  All four of us were making annoying noises of enjoyment, plus our server (who's name has slipped my mind) was friendly and trying very hard to be a good server, which was endearing.\n\nThey gave us a nice giant piece of ice cream cake as well - we were there for a special occasion, which was a nice touch.  \n\nI'm sitting here at my desk, thinking of what I once had and wondering if me and that steak's cousin will ever meet...and the asparagus I had was obviously a gift from the asparagus God himself.  I will return here, mark my words.
