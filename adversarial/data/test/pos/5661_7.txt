Came in for a trade-in. Apparently a $1200 Macbook bought 6 months prior AT Best Buy in near perfect condition is worth $70.  On top of everything, I was left standing there while this lady stared at the computer screen for at least 15 minutes in silence. She calls a Geek Squad member over and they murmur to each other for another good 5 minutes. Can anyone tell me what's going on? They let me know my trade in value of $70 and proceeded to say \"yeah our system sucks, try the Apple Store.\" Real nice. Nobody ever even seems to enjoy working there in all my years of going to ANY Best Buy. This is coming from a previous employee as well.  \n\nWorthless, uncaring customer service. I post this review only because this is ALWAYS the case with Best Buy. My final straw, will never step into another building again. Peace out.
