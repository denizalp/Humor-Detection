I implore you: Please please help Montreal mexican cuisine by treating yourself to Don Taco and supporting local businesses that are truly adding to the cultural diversity of the city instead of acting as hipster flytraps for white 20-somethings.\n\nSomehow it came to pass that a single Taco in Montreal should cost 6$ and be regarded as some kind of luxury. So I'm thankful for whatever confluence of disparate events that led to the existence of Don Taco - this miraculous Mexican food shelter serving 2-3$ amazing and delicious corn tortilla tacos. \n\nI'll call it authentic, and your eyes will start to roll from how cliche it is nowadays to call something authentic. Yet I swear they'll unroll as soon as the flavours of an Al Pastor taco reach the tip of your tongue. \n\nKeep in mind it's a tiny place, so either be happy eating while standing at the small counter\/bar, or take your food to go. This is a great place to stop by for a quick snack while you're doing the million things you can be doing in the downtown core.\n\nWhatever you do don't miss it!
