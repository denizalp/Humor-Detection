Very disappointing... The pictures look really good but everything was bland. Their \"famous\" egg pudding was super bland and their \"famous\"  coconut ho fun was nothing amazing. The texture was good, chewy but bland. I was so not impressed that I didn't even finish my dessert and I usually finish my desserts. Staff is very friendly. But Limited seats and glass wear. They didn't have enough cups for water. Because of the limited seats I felt like they were kinda rushing us out. Brought us the cheque even before we asked for it. And felt like they kept pacing back and forth our table. Dont think I'll be coming back here.
