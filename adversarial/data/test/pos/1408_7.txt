Come here if you want a regrettable haircut.\n\nGot the haircut from some old asian guy with white hair.\n\nHe tells you to take a seat and then abuses your head with a razor with no disregard.\n\nAfter he said that he was done with the cut, he revealed the hair and I found a huge chunk of hairs longer than the rest of my head in the middle.\n\nAfter I asked for him to fix it, he got pissed, rushed with his scissors to cut a few strands, then took my apron so I wouldn't get another chance to ask for my hair to be fixed.\n\nThen he ushered to the front and asked for me to pay.\n\nDON'T GO TO THIS PLACE.\n\nI only had to go here since the nearby competitor was closed that day. Go to that one instead
