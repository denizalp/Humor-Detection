Bought my car in November. Car hasn't had any issues until I brought it here for a oil change. Now I have major repairs needed after a shady person there did something to my car. We will never be back.\n\nPlus it took 2 hours to do an oil change. I could have done that myself in 10 min. Then they charged $75! What?! Did you put gold in the oil?
