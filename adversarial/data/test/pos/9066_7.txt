So I went into this store yesterday dressed in a nice 300$ 2 piece suit and tie to turn in my application, upon arriving I spoke with a manager named Jim, the interview went well and he had told me I got the job and that I would start in 2 days. The day before I'm supposed to start working the gentleman calls and says oh sorry Jon, but we hired too many people and there's no open positions for you right now. I was depending on this job as my only source of income and now I'm looking at losing my home because I won't be able to afford my rent. My whole family is disappointed in me now because this man lied to me and probably ruined my entire future possibilities of success. Thanks shop n save for making me suffer the consequences of your poorly ran and even more poorly organized store
