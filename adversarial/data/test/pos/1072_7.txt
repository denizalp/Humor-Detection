California..knows how to par-tay. California..knows how to par-taay. In the city, of VEGAS!! \n\nThis hotel is located in an old section of Vegas. It's part Hawaiian kine haunt, part asians & filipinos who want oxtail soup train, part senior gambler spot. \n\nThe cafe offers an array of diner options, but the difference is there are Hawaiian grinds, such as eggs, portuguese sausage & white rice, mac salad..and YES..that famous coveted Zippys chili.\n\nOno-effin-licious. Almost like being on the island. Almost. :)
