From 6\/23\/15\n\nThis store is located in the Sahara Pavilion and has the typical TJ Maxx set up. They also have a decent section for fitness clothes, good prices, and when I need to pick up a quick outfit. It's a super convenient store when you need to grab something in the spur of he moment as well.
