LTI is a place families and friends go to have a celebration.  There were 4 or 5 tables of 10 or 12 that were celebrating Birthdays, so it was fun to get to sing along.  We went with a small group to celebrate too. It is a little on the noisy side so if you are a small group try to get the smaller side dining area.  \nIt is BYOB!  It is $5 per bottle you open, so bring a big bottle. LOL Actually a reasonable price even if you have a screw top bottle. \nIf you are in a hurry this is not the place for you.   It has been years since I have been to LTI due to my last experience with a waiter but that is long gone.  Our waitress was good and had help delivering our food and picking up our dirty plates. \nOf course you have to share a couple of appetizers.  The beans and greens are you standard fare; nothing special but what you would expect.  The Calamari Frutti was very good.   For the main course I had the Tortelini with Crab and Shrimp with a spicy roasted red pepper cream sauce was a very good choice with enough left over for a good lunch.  For desert we were in the share mode and had a very good Cannoli and some really good spumoni covered in a chocolate crust. So if you are in the mode for a nice dinner and\/or having a celebration this is a good choice.
