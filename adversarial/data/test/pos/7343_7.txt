If you have always wanted to try truly authentic Peruvian food, this is the place to do it. \n\nPeruvian food is influenced by Japanese cuisine, so don't expect the food to lean really Spanish here. \n\nI ordered the pollo saltado. The dish was extremely flavorful with the soy sauce emanating through. Some might find the chicken to be a bit dry, but it reminded me of the stir fried chicken in Thai food. Even the rice was buttery and perfect. My favorite part was the French fries soaking in the sauce on the bottom of the plate.\n\nThe service is very friendly here. The waiter can offer you an iPad with images of all the food, if you're more visual. The owner is also the chef.\n\nThe prices might seems a little on the high side, but the portions are large.\n\nThe location is strange, but the best food rarely is in the best location. \n\nI highly recommend checking this place out, if you're looking for something different.
