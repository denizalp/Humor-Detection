Apparently, when I say I hate Red Robin, people react as though I'm saying I hate Disneyland. \n\nI just can't get into the jar of mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and tasteless meat they put into their burgers.\n\nGourmet burgers my ass.\n\nFries were great, spinach and artichoke dip was great. \nI guess I'll eat vegetarian here.
