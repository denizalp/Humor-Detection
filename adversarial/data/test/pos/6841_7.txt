I've been to Cibo about three times in the past two weeks, and hot damn is it ever good! I celebrated my birthday there with a table of thirty, the reservation was smooth, and the place is so big that seating for a party that large is not at all a problem (employees of the former Roger's video probably gape at what the space once was). Several scodellinas later ( the roasted eggplant dip, the date salad, the ricotta, and the aracini are a few of my favourites), we were knee deep in delicious drinks and entrees (great pizza, up there with the quality of Double Zero and Una, and awesome pasta, I recommend the gnocchi). Overall, the ambiance is friendly (family and otherwise), the wait staff are always efficient and seem happy to be serving you (no mute service or servers that are seen once and never again), and the food is top notch Italian, especially for the price. \nCibo has become my go to place for eating out on 17th, and I hope the quality of the food and service continues to be a steady four stars.
