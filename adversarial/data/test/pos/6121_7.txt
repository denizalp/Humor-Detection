I really have no idea why every is so in  love with this chain. It's your basic greasy, thin crust pizza, WAY overpriced. This is seriously what everyone keeps voting as the best pizza in Vegas? SERIOUSLY!? Ick. I've had pizza at Pizza Hut that had more flavor than the one I ate here. The crust is bland, the cheese is, well cheese, and for all I know the sauce could have been like Ragu or something.
