Horrible customer service! Went in to buy a tree and asked \"Trevor\" to help me out. He said no one buys plants this time of year and when I insisted I wanted one, he said he offers no guarantee and it will die. When I asked to speak with manager he said I couldn't and refused to give me his name. I asked again and he said \"Trevor\". No one was in the place. I guess he was upset because I interrupted his Facebook surfing while at the cash register. Never again!
