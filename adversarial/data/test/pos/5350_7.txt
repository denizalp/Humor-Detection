I went to Chloe Spa a week and a half ago and paid $70 (!) for a full SNS set with design. I usually go to another nail salon that is 15 mins away from me and decided to give this place a try after seeing the high reviews and because it is down the street from my house. I had high hopes but unfortunately, I will not be returning. \n\nThe day after getting my nails done, my thumb nail broke. My pinky nail broke yesterday. Chips and scratches were present within the first few days. Upon closer inspection, the shape of my \"coffin\" nails were wonky with one side of the nail being more slanted than the other side. When I went in to get the thumb nail fixed she cut the nail shorter than my other thumb. \n\nI have had acrylic nails put on MANY times before and have never had a broken or even a chipped nail. I work in an office and am not hard on my nails at all. Despite this, I had TWO nails break and multiple chips. \n\nThis salon is also kind of shady. I asked to get Swarovski crystals on my nails and what I received became dull and cloudy the next day. When I brought this up to the salon owner simply shrugged it off. They look significantly different than other Swarovski crystal manicures I have seen, but was charged $1 per crystal. \n\nDespite all this, I will say that their service is good. I was promptly seen each visit and was treated well. The thumb nail repair was free of charge. \n\nOne thing I wish I had been told is that you cannot get a fill on SNS nails, so you pay for a new full set each time. They are less harsh than acrylic, but also significantly less durable (which is shown by the breaks).\n\nI added pictures to the picture library as well.
