Absolutely fantastic....without exxagerating Grape Bistro is a gem to have to close to the house. The dinner menu is quite varied and there is something to suit every taste bud.\n\nI chose the blue cheese burger as I wanted something simple and it was scrumptious. My dinner guest had the same and we also started our evening with a cheese plate to share which was lovely.\n\nOur waitress Kayla was very warm and attentive.\n\nSo glad I finally got to try Grape Bistro and will definitely return.
