This staff is unprofessional when I moved in my carpet was clean but my apartment was dirty and not one but three of my mopeds was stolen . Besides that my apartment was hunted come to find out the last guy that lived in the same apartment the ghost try to attack him and his wife as well . I did my research and a young couple was killed in that apartment and for two weeks later by police. Don't move here
