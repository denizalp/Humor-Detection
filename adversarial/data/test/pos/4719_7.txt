The only thing this place has going for it is the marketing.     The food is WAY overhyped and underwhelming.  There are taco trucks here in Vegas with far superior Mexican food.     Don't get me started on the \"shareable\" chips and salsa that I had to pay for.     There wasn't enough salsa for ME let alone anyone else.   Unless this place wakes the hell up I hope it goes the way of Agave & Dos Caminos.     What Summerlin doesn't need is pretentious \"Modern Mexican Food\".
