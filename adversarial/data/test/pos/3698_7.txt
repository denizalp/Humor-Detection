You know that feeling when you need an off-the-shoulder lacy tank top in 5 different colors? Yeah, me neither. But that's what you'll find here. \n\nThis store is color coordinated. So if you know a certain color doesn't fit your complexion, you can completely skip that section. For me, I don't even go near anything beige. Anyway, like I was saying everything is color coordinated. You can find the same top in 5 different colors. The majority of their clothes are clubby and just too flashy for my taste. Like everyone said in their reviews, you get what you pay for. The reason you pay $14 for dress pants is because they use cheap material that'll make you sweaty and the seams will start unthreading. Their jewelry, also dirt cheap since they tarnish with only one usage. Don't get me wrong, I've found a few pieces here and there. My recent find was a pink flowery scarf for $6 and a linen blazer that was on clearance for $3. \n\nThe girls here are super \"don't talk to me\" and if you do, they look like the type of girls that will talk smack about you once you turn around. Their return policy, oh wait, no returns. Exchange or store credit with receipt within 7 days. I'll drop in if I need to find something last minute, but I don't expect to have a closet worth of their stuff any time soon.
