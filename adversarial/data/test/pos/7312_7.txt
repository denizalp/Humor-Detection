Ho hum.  This is a sad sad place that is not likely long for this world.  Today, I spent $90 on lunch for two without any alcohol.   I was drawn there by Now Magazine's top ten of 2011.  I think it must have gone downhill since whenever Now was there last. \n\nThe space itself is quite nice except for the constant din of what sounds like a road repair crew's industrial generator just outside your window.  It turns out that's actually the building's heating system.. Unlike a road crew, it never goes away.  \n\nThe waitress was just barely pleasant.  She was a bit slow, a bit incompetent and had a way of making you think that she was really above this station in life - and not in the snarky way that younger staff do - this time, we actually believed it ourselves.   \n\nI asked the waitress about the soup of the day.  She said it was carrot.  Carrot with ginger or peanut?  I asked.  Nope, just carrot she replied.  The carrot soup came with some sort of cheese and some sort of chutney.  We'll never know more than that.  \n\nIronically, the soup tasted nothing like carrots.  It tasted more like squash, and mostly, it just plain sucked.  Roasted chicken had some nice flavourings going on, but it was dry.  I'd tell you about the stuffing that comes with the chicken but it arrived without stuffing.  \n\nBacon-wrapped venison was cooked perfectly.  Jerusalem artichoke hearts were excellent.  \n\nOverall, this place is underwhelming, overpriced and has a stench of death about it.
