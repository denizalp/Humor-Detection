After a few visits here I can safely say LGO is tops on my places to eat in Phoenix. My friend who I stay with when I visit lives just down the road, so every time I visit him I know I'll stop in here for breakfast. \n\nThis last visit was no different. I came in here three different times over the course of a long weekend. My favorite is the French pancakes (more like crepes) and the Ricky Martin breakfast wrap. The fresh squeezed OJ and baked goods and gelato are perfect any time of the day as well. \n\nI would actually take up residence in here if it was allowed. I love LGO that much. Can't wait to come back upon my next Phoenix visit!
