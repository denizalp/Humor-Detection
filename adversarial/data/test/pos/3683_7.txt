It's been about 30 minutes and I still haven't been helped.... \nI was told to sit and someone would be with me shortly. I see people walking in and out and get helped and I'm still here. Wah. Employees walk right past me without saying anything. \nI wonder if I'm invisible....... Or maybe I'm being ignored because I'm not here to buy...
