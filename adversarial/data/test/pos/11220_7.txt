You can't go wrong with Target wherever you're at.  \n\nWe were headed back to the strip but noticed a Target and stopped in to pick up some things for our trip and our room.  This Target is about a mile away from the strip and perfect for those items you might have forgotten while on vacation or if you need something.\n\nIt's a large, clean, well organized store and open late for that Vegas crowd.  Unfortunately, it attracts a lot of people and there were several lines but only 3 registers open.
