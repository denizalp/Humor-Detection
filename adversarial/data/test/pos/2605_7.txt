Modern Urban Japan is a cramped maze of deliciousness at every turn.   You often will find the absolute finest eating experiences tucked away in department stores, subway stations and alleyways.    Tachi is the first place that I've been to outside of Japan that captures that energy and essence while delivering at the highest level. \n\nThere are no seats.  You stand up.   \n\nYou circle around a sushi counter while the chef creates an 11 course Omakase experience.   You eat each bite immediately while served.   Every piece is better than the last.  The rice has a perfect tinge of vinegar.  The tuna becomes progressively fattier.  The attention to detail is stunning. \n\nThe best part is how it's the kind of gem that's hidden in plain site.  A small nook in the heart of the city's best food court. \n\nAn exceptional experience.
