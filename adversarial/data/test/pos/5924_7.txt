St. Phillip's cheesecake is a place where you can get customized cakes on basically any design you want from blackberrys, beer bottles, coach purse bags and the miscellaneous \"adult cakes\". You can even add your own custom photo with an addition $15 when you upload it online. \n\nThe one that I tried this time was the Strawberry Cheesecake. These cakes normally cost around $30 for 10-12 serving sizes, with the exception of a few of their specialty St. Honores collections which are around 12-15 servings or more.\n\nI never really used to like cheesecakes when I was small, but as I adapted to the Western culture I began to accommodate to it. Having tried different cheesecakes, the best part about this cake was the strawberries. They were giant in size, juicy and extremely sweet which may had to do with the sauce. The cake itself was fairly good with a moderately soft interior with a breadcrumb\/nut like exterior.
