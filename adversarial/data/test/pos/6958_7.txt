I had lunch with a friend at stingray this past sunday, after we figured out that most sushi places are not open until 4pm on sunday. Stingray has a trendy decor to go with a variety of trendy cocktails. One thing i have noticed about several sushi places is that they always have a plethora of specialty cocktails! At any rate, my friend and I ordered the wild salmon roll, the las vegas roll and the moto rolla. The moto rolla was absolutely my favorite! Its a cucumber wrapped roll with yellowtail, salmon and avocado. SO SO good! The las vegas roll and the wild salmon did not disappoint either. The fish itself seemed to be fresh, and the price point wasnt outrageous either. Ill definitely be back :)
