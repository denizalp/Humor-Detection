Having read the rave reviews about  Au Pied de Cochon,I had high expectations before I even arrived. I`m pleased to say they weren't only met, they were exceeded! The atmosphere was lovely, the service fantastic and the food incredible. Five stars!\n\nTo start, my friend and I shared the snails and the salami tray. I have to say the thought of eating snails grossed me out, but I reluctantly tried them. They were delicious. The brandy and BBQ in the sauce made the dish. The salami tray was predictably scrumptious.\n\nFor my \"high gear\", I had the duck carpaccio This was possibly the best duck I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge duck  fan, I still think you should try it. The cream sauce drizzled over it was fantastic.\n\n\nI almost forgot to share my cocktail experience. You must get the Pom Pom! It`s got pomegranate juice, ginger and mint, to name a few ingredients. I also tried the Rosemary Pink Diamond Fuzz which was also very good. I had a sip of the Blue Mojito, but it was too sweet for my liking.\n\nSimply put, Au Pied de Cochon is superb. I can`t wait to go back.
