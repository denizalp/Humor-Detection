As you pull into the parking lot, it is not for the reason you expect - we will not be stopping at the Crazy Horse.  At least, not initially.  If you want to later, that is entirely up to you (eyes on you, Jay R.).\n\nKnow in advance that this little strip mall tucked along Independence Boulevard has seen better days.  At least, I assume they have, because they sure don't look too hot now.  Ten years (give or take) ago, you could have at least found a T.G.I. Friday's in the middle of the lot.  Now it is a boarded up husk.  Not even furniture outlet stores will dare to make their way inside.  Not legally anyway.  If you see someone there, you might want to keep going.\n\nThen there was the Rock & Roll Emporium, sort of a mom-and-pop version of Spencer Gifts that did quasi-illicit piercings in the back room.  Not terribly sanitary, but that does take the fun out of it, right?  Then there was Seven Doors Down, which was not a band, but a lingerie\/adult gift shop, that was actually run by said mom and pop, and started seven doors down from the emporium.  Even a really bad little pizza buffet, now (thankfully) gone as well.\n\nThese days you just have the Crazy Horse, what appears to be a Happy Endings Massage Parlor down the way (hmm... now we know why we get so many visitors from Northern California!), Don Pedro for Mexican and Fu Lin.  I think the Laser Quest may even have closed by now.\n\nBut that's okay, because Fu Lin is indeed a gem.  Their menu is not only impressive for vegetarian offerings, as Julia S. has mentioned, it is, in fact, impressive on just about every offering.  Even the Cheesecake Factory may come to them for menu advice.\n\nNow I am no expert on either Indo-Chinese or vegetarian fare.  But I do like to eat.  And the food that we ordered up here was awfully tasty and some dishes come served in the coolest little steel woks to boot.  Talk about awesome.  The service wasn't exactly speedy, even though we were among the only people in the place (thus the lack of star #5).  But it is well worth a trek to the seedy side of town.  Slip through the dark side and cross that line when you get a chance.
