Got the green curry tofu lunch special ($8) to go. The lunch includes 2 small spring rolls, your choice of brown or white rice, and if you eat-in soup is included too. It was well packaged and ready in about 10 minutes. \n\nThe curry was a medium level of spiciness to me and had a lot of vegetables and soft tofu. The sauce was nicely seasoned and I had a plentiful amount of rice to eat it with. The spring rolls were lightly crispy and a good complement to the curry. The curry was a bit watery though.\n\nThe interior is well decorated with light wood accents. I'll have to eat in one of these days to enjoy the ambiance! Overall it was a good meal and I'd go back to try more off the menu.\n\n3.5\/5
