The guy who owns this place has a real bad attitude and it equates to bad service and a negative feel.\n\nThe gyros here, for lack of another word suck.  The lamb is terrible and that's what makes the gyro.  The sauce on it is decent but nothing special, and you can't really screw up tomatoes and onions so no credit for those.
