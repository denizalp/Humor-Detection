This place is still rock solid!  We ordered the garlic spareribs and were AMAZED at how good it was.  \n\nImagine fried minced garlic that taste like mini croutons.  A heaping mound of it was tossed on top of the fried ribs.  I've never had anything like it.  I was shoveling spoonfuls of it into my mouth....
