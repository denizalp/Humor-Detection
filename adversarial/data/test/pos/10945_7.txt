I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is actually one of the few restaurants on the Strip that is NOT overrated. Located inside the SLS Las Vegas, this is a very nice place to wine and dine and impress your guests. \nLike the name implies, this is a meat-centric establishment.The very first display is a Japanese Wagyu Beef certification statement that explains the grade of Wagyu used and it's authentication at Bazaar meat. As soon as you start walking towards your table, you will see the magic happening. It's like a live show of meats being cooked constantly in front of you and the various cuts before cooking. Although this place serves more than just steaks, you should really try a cut of something if this is your first time here. \nI do recommend trying any one of their salads. The presentation and arrangement of these salads are very unique and of course, very tasty. Additionally with your steak (of which I assume you're having), try the Robuchon potatoes. I'm gonna use the word 'dangerous' when describing this stuff. Also, 'incredible'. The desserts here are the only items that didn't really amaze me but they were still good. The outstanding wine selection will round out your evening. \nThis place isn't cheap. If you get a full course dinner, you can run your bill up around $200 per person. To help you out, The SLS and this restaurant have a relationship with BMW of Las Vegas, and you can get a $100 coupon at this restaurant from the dealership when you purchase a new BMW. Enjoy your evening here. I don't mind going to the strip for this place.
