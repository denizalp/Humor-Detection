Very chic and fabulous ! The location in city center is superb! \nThe valet is efficient , no hassle and very friendly.\nThe lobby bar is so chill, relaxed and very comfortable. Our waitress was kind and I complimented her on her uniform, which is very classy and sexy. She seemed happy to be there.\nEnjoyed a nice drink or two with my friend. Definitely a nice atmosphere for a drink and good conversation\nDid I mention the hotel smells delicious! What a glorious scent this hotel has when you first walk through the lobby doors.\nHighly recommend \n5star quality hotel!
