I don't understand how anyone can give this place less than 5 stars -- IT DESERVES 8!!!\n\nThe main complaints I've heard about the joint are that it's totally Disneyfied, and on the expensive side. Well, I'm the biggest fucking Disney-hater on the planet, and one of the cheapest assholes you'll ever meet...and I would STILL come here every day for breakfast, lunch AND dinner -- plus a midnight snack!\n\nThe decor is absolutely astonishing in its attention to detail. In that respect, it really does feel like you're at Disneyland -- only not the part with all the sniveling brats being towed around by fat moms and emasculated dads in matching Mickey and Minnie sweatshirts. It's more like being at Disneyland on acid, and stumbling into this secret hidden annex where the flash-frozen body of Walt Disney has been reanimated and is spinning Esquivel while snorting lines of meth mixed with pure cane sugar! IT'S THAT COOL!\n\nThe drinks are definitely not as cheap as you'd get at Palace Station, but they're not serving Thunderbird and PBR -- this shit is legit as fuck!! Fresh ingredients, fun garnishes and PLENTY of booze; I was pretty blitzed after just one Pain Reliever. The quality and the ambiance are worth every penny you spend here.\n\nA huge bonus is the location -- close enough to the Strip for the tourists, close enough to Downtown for the poseur hipsters, and right off the freeway for the fat moms and emasculated dads (just leave your fucking sweatshirts in the suburbs)! Being in Chinatown, it's also within walking distance of about 50 amazing, cheap restaurants -- many of which are open LATE, so you could even go grub after getting completely wasted here. \n\nBut my suggestion is to grab dinner first, and head here for a nightcap or three afterward. And then, when you're totally fucking blotto...you can head to one of the many massage parlors in the area. \n\nJust like Disney.....you too can have a Happy Ending :-D
