I have to say they have a great parking lot I am never allowed to go  in the store so I can only write about the parking lot.\nThey have a cool tractor that you can play on.\nThey have some apple trees in the lot that once in while I might have a fallen apple. \nThey have fresh chickens and ducks behind a fence that I just look through and drool. \nEverone leaving the store looks happy to see me.
