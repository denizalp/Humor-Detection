I have a lot to say about BJ's. Let's start off with the walk from the parking spaces to the building. If you park across the driving path, be careful! The cars come flying down the ramp from the mall parking lot and we had a close call when we were trying to cross. I think maybe it would be a good safety practice to put up a speed limit sign or paint in a cross-walk so there are no accidents.\n\nOnce we approached the door, we noticed that the main entrance is a revolving door. I know there is some kind of energy savings with a revolving door but this one is the stuff of nightmares. If the waiting room is crowded, there will be people standing on the inside of the revolving door so when you go through it, you can't exit easily. Now, there are handicapped doors available to the side of the revolving door so I strongly urge you to use them if the restaurant is busy. \n\nWhen we entered, I walked up to the hostess and told her there were two people in our party and gave her my name. She wanted my first name, last initial, and my phone number. I looked at her puzzled and she said, \"Oh, the phone number is so we can text you when your table is ready. Sorry, I'm assuming you've never been here before?\" She was correct, I had never been there before so I think she should ask if we would like a text when our table is ready instead of demanding customer phone numbers with no preface. \n\nWe were told it would be a 30 minute wait but I don't think it was that long. When I got the text that our table was ready, I went back up to the hostess stand and she pointed behind her to the other hostess stand. Why two stands?? This is kind of confusing for a newcomer. So, the people at the second stand take you to your table. It takes up a lot of extra space that could be used to extra waiting room seating to eliminate the revolving door issue. Just sayin'.\n\nThe host seated us at a cozy 2-person corner booth at the back of the restaurant. We were pretty happy about that! It was my husband's birthday so a little romantic spot to enjoy our meals was appreciated! \n\nWe looked over the drinks menu and ordered some unique brews. It's really cool that they have a lot of craft beers to choose from. They had a beer I had been looking for but hadn't ever found so I was very excited to order it. Next, we ordered our meals. I ordered the guacamole bacon burger and hubby ordered a different burger.\n\nThe burgers came out and looked gorgeous! I really enjoyed my burger but it didn't enjoy me. Unfortunately, I was sick all night. I've never had a burger do me wrong like that, it was kinda disappointing because the flavor of the burger was pretty good. The fries were also good. I like the thin shoestring fries! I really wanted to order a salad from the healthier menu but I couldn't justify paying $14 for a salad.\n\nOverall, weird new experience. Not sure we'll be back. If you're that close to The Rail, you go to The Rail!
