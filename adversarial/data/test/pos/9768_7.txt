Our office is just a few blocks away along the Queensway. Saw that a new location was open so we checked out for lunch. Nice location with lots of detail in the design. Seemed like a much more relaxed environment than the other locations I've been too. \n\nCalamari was delicious! Perfectly crunchy and seasoned. We also tried the canjun fried rice. It was quite a large portion and was super tasty. My main order was the teriyaki fish with rice. Wow! Was that a good deal. If you're there before 4 pm for the same price of $11 you get the fish, rice and a seafood assortment which includes 2 mussels, 2 shrimp, 2 crawfish and 2 clams. It was a great way to get a taste of everything. \n\nStaff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back!
