I was really hoping this salon would be really friendly considering of the reviews I have been reading from other salons which were not that good so I turned here to see if this would be a good salon.\n\nI called a few times and then the phone was picked up by a very unenthusiastic lady who sounded very bored. Yikes. I asked what her hours were and she asked today or every day (again very bored sounding) she told me the hours and I asked if she was booked up and she said most of employers were off due to spring break and it depending on what service I wanted to get done.\n\nWell that will not sit well with a customer seeking service and you should always have back up workers who are willing to work on their spring break for some extra money but hearing that most of the workers are gone on their spring vacation is not good. \n\nI just said that I'll call back next week but really I\"ll just go look else where. This is very sad and i would hope it would be an good relaxing experience on my day off.
