An old blast from my past, Bar Cento is like the ex boyfriend whom I still adore... not that I really have that person but... Just roll with the metaphor here...\n\nHe's sure of himself: It's been a few years since I've been back, but damn if things aren't familiar. The vibe is chill, the menu remains similar and there are still some of my favorite pizzas on the list.\n\nHe's masculine: Dark and mysterious, strong and handsome. Bar Cento exudes confidence and coolness. And have you noticed the indoor gazebos?! I dig it.\n\nHe can cook: Back once more to the pizza! So good! This time around we ordered the sausage\/pep duo and the bubbly crust, gooey cheese, and slightly spicy meats made me weak in the knees! (That's what she said... I digress.) The olives are baked with rosemary and have that specially spiced flavor and the \"family\" meat\/cheese platter (olives included) is quite impressive. There were at least three or four different kinds of meat and cheese alone!\n\nHe can handle his booze: Let's talk about that awesome beer list folks! I mean, c'mon have you met his brother Bier Markt? The wine list sister is pretty good looking as well.\n\nHe keeps me coming back: Yes, he was THAT good... Even three years later. \n\nThanks for reading and letting me have a little fun with my review. :) I really do enjoy this place!
