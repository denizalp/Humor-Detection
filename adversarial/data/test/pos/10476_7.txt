So I had some mixed feelings about JET before I went. Honestly, I was going since we had VIP tickets here and figured they were close to my hotel so I should put 'em to good use. When we first arrived, they weren't letting anyone but re-entries in and the cover was $40. Helllll no. When I flashed my little smile and asked about our passes, the guy said basically carried us in. Awesome.\n\nIf y'all are into hip hop music like myself, then you'll really like this club. I listen to all kinds of music but when I'm out and about, I wanna shake my rump to some good stuff - none of this house, fist-pumping nonsense. This was a huge venue with poppin' music and a cool crowd. From other reviews, people were saying this place is too ghetto. Oh, then either A) I came on a good night or B) they need to take themselves elsewhere that's 5x more pretentious. This isn't the best club in Vegas by any means, but I'll definitely be back because it was a fun and pretty laid-back spot to visit.
