Don't depend on groupon to get a good deal. I literally compared this place to its competition by there reviews and from what I read first baby imaging was the best. \n\nWell I called to make an appointment 5 weeks ago and whoever I spoke with did not give me enough information to save me a 30min drive. \n\nI told the lady that I wanted to find out the gender before my doctor told me since I would have to wait till 20 weeks. My appointment was for today which I am currently 16weeks. Once I arrive the sign in form has a box stating a $25 fee would be added to my charge if this was my first ultrasound. It also says that they are not a medical clinic and the information they would provide me is everything a doctor would tell me. So why would I pay you $25 if your information is not valid and why wouldn't someone notify me when I made this appointment 5 weeks ago of this extra charge.\n\nNot only did this sudden news make me upset but I was told to arrive 15min early for me to wait at the front desk for 10min to check in. I also requested the first appointment of the day and there were two groups before me. \n\nI will never return to this facility due to how unprofessional it is run and I even informed them on this review. \n\nThis is my first child and I was really looking forward to finding out the gender early but I guess I will have to wait 4 more weeks till a real doctor can give me accurate information.
