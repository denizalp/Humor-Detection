I say two stars because the people were nice. \nThat aside, I have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants and I went here because of how well it was talked up, its location and sadly assuming the prices reflected the quality of food.  Makes me wonder how many other places the reviewers have gone for Japanese food because this place tasted like they have no reference level.\n\nLet me start with the fact I came here for an anniversary dinner.  Big mistake. \n\nThe regular sushi rolls were the smallest I have ever received at any restaurant I have gotten sushi.  The quality of the fish wasn't that great for the price, but hey, I know this is important, the rice was good.  But MARKET DISTRICT offers bigger pieces of sushi.\n\nThe service was bad.  I am wondering if that was a reflection on our persons because everyone else there seemed to be on a first name basis and dressed exceedingly well ( which isn't a shock given the area ).  Our service was not good and there weren't even that many people there.  One of the rolls I ordered was never entered even though the waitress repeated back what I asked for.  And I've waited less time for beverage refills at incredibly busy morning breakfast places.\n\nThe donburi combo bowl of tuna and sushi, for its price and quality, was laughable.  I don't know what they think they are selling, but it wasn't worth what I paid.  And I regret my entree.  The Koren Chirashi sounded like a good idea, like cold Bibimbop, and it was.  However, the hot sauce that goes into it over takes your pallet and you can't ever appreciate the fish.\n\nAnd my girlfriend the following morning does not feel well in the way you feel bad after eating bad food, and that was the last thing she ate that day.\n\nThe \"Too Long, Didn't Read\" of this is\nThe prices are a joke for the portions and quality and are most likely what they are for the area.  The overall experience was very disappointing and I 100% would not go back.  I regret not taking us to our regular favorite and significantly better Japanese restaurant.\n\nThanks for ruining our evening.
