I wish that I would have read my OWN 2 star review for this place before I went back. The bathrooms were gross and unkempt and I struggled to enjoy my meal after encountering such poor cleanliness in the restroom.\n\nI ordered a veggie taco salad and the menu descriptions did not represent the salad that I was served.  The menu description stated veggie meat and corn of which there was none in my salad.\n\nI asked one of the staff members  about the missing ingredients to which the said that corn may have been removed and that veggie meat stood for \"beans\".  I found that interesting,  since beans and veggie meat were listed as separate items separated by commas on the menu description.  The salad was just okay however I would not dear pay another $10.00 for it again. \n\nI did not have a great experience and it is doubtful that I will return.
