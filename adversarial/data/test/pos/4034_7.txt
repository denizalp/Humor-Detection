Very disappointed in the place. I wanted a new stainless steel appliance package before putting my house of for sale.  They showed me a package with a refrigerator that was next to another refrigerator.  They did not have the professionalism to tell me the sides of the refrigerator was just a gray metal, not a stainless steel. My bad for not asking, but why would I think to ask - I said I wanted stainless steel.  It looks bad.  Beware of this place.
