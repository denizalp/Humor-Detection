The Beat Coffeehouse proudly plays rock music in the background while serving different types of drinks and offering a decent selection of things to munch on. It's a short walk from the Downtown Container Park and across from Commonwealth. \n\nThe interior was pretty cool. Different things such as newspaper articles, ads, and posters were all tacked up on their walls. The music was pretty good; a lot of rock classics played and then other songs I've never even heard of before came on. They had vinyl records for sale in the little crates on the counters.\n\nI ordered a mango\/banana smoothie, but I'm pretty sure I was handed just a plain banana smoothie... Okay, maybe the nice young woman taking my order didn't hear me. It's alright, though, because I honestly needed something cold and refreshing to cool me off before I venture off into the crowd for First Friday. When the guy behind the counter called me up to grab my drink, he handed it to me in a way that made the drink ooze out through the lid and fly everywhere! There weren't any apologies, no offering up napkins, nothing. Well, whatever. At least I got my drink. (Although I did have to clean it up for the photo). The smoothie had the ripe banana taste and wasn't really that sweet.\n\nI sat on the couch, and it made me sink in it a little. It's super comfortable and it got to the point where I felt like I wanted to take a nap. In the same building (towards the back), there's the Emergency Arts art gallery which you should check out if you've got the spare time... I don't think this coffee shop is a good place for groups of 4+ people, but it's perfect for bringing a friend or two to chill (or go solo and work on some stuff).
