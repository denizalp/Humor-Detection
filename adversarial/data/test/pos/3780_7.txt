I can't believe the greediness of this casino. They want guests to pay for wifi.....this is a email they sent out ....\n\nWith the yearly increases that we experience in our over-all operating expenses, we have begun charging a fee for wi-fi usage at Talking Stick Resortâ„¢. The $25 fee went into effect February 1, 2017. \n\nIn order to purchase your wi-fi password, all you need to do is go to the Talking Stick Resort hotel Front Desk desk and a wi-fi passcode valid for 30 days on three devices will be issued to you for a fee of $25 plus applicable tax. You may also purchase your wi-fi passcode by calling Reservations at 1-866-877-9897. \n\nWe want to thank you and look forward seeing you on your next visit to Talking Stick Resort.
