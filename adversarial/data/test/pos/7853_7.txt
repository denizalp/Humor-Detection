We came on a Saturday evening and ordered \n1. Pho with rare and well-done beef, 9.79\n2. Vermicelli with shrimp, pork, and egg roll, 9.79\nfor 23 \n\n- Doors opened for us. Seated right away.\n- Clean. nice seating. Not your sloppy Viet restaurant on spring mtn, You know it's already better when they give you a water cup in a glass rather than on plastic cups. haha. \n- Too Americanized. Sounds like a starbucks. haha. \n- Pho broth was great. Meat was tender. Not much fat. This pretty much what separates any Viet restaurant. A bit expensive for a bowl of pho. \n- noodles stayed consistent. didn't get hard. \n- Pork was flavorful. Didn't need much sauce.\n- good portions. \n- Service was nice and attentive. Not busy.
