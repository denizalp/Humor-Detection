Yup, basically as good as it gets.  Perhaps the best meal of my life thus far, rivaling my meal at Providence in LA and better (in my opinion) than the prix fixe that I had next door for more than twice the price at Joel Robuchon.\n\nService was impeccable, and the food was SO GOOD.  \n\nI forgot that foie gras is available here in Vegas, unlike back home in California, so my friend and I got practically every foie gras option we could.  \n\nJR next door is prix fixe only and VERY fancy, but this place has a more low-key vibe overall.  You can order from the prix fixe menu, you can order a la carte, or you can mix and match the two.  Our server explained that the a la carte items provide the standout dishes that you can't find on the prix fixe menus, but that the prix fixe menus provide a good (relatively) cost-effective way of trying out some trademark dishes.  There's an open kitchen that's fascinating to watch, and the vibe is way livelier than next door.  \n\nMy friend and I opted for the Menu B for $105 (their biggest prix fixe menu that's not the entire menu de degustation (which I believe is around $165, with an optional wine pairing for an additional $105)), along with 3 small tasting items, and it ended up being plenty of food for the two of us.  Menu B provides for an amuse bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a dessert.  \n\nThey were nice enough to provide us with two amuse bouches even though we ordered only one prix fixe.  The amuse bouche was a delicious creamy cup of foie gras topped with a parmesan foam.  \n\nFor our menu items, we ordered the hamachi, the snapper and the oysters from the small tasting menu, and for our Menu B, we ordered the uni with foie gras, foie gras risotto, beef cheek, and lobster orecchiette. \n\nThe standout dish BY FAR was the uni with foie gras.  OH MY GOD.  Perhaps the best dish I've ever tried in my life.  All the little flavors came together beautifully.   \n\nOtherwise, every other dish was also wonderful and delicious but the uni was definitely the standout star of the meal.  \n\nWe finished it off with a dessert called le cafe - once again, it had to be savored together with all the flavors on the dish, and it was amazing.  \n\nDefinitely a more fun vibe than stuffy JR next door with food that is just as good.  \n\nYes, it's pricy, but for one of Joel Robuchon's only 2 restaurants in the US, I'd say it's worth it.
