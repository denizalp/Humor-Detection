I've seen every Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas and performances by Boys To Men, Terry Fator and Carrot Top.  I've been impressed throughout the years with the type of quality impressive shows but unfortunately Criss Angel does not fall into that category.\n\nI paid close to $170 for a single ticket for a Thursday night performance within the 3rd row from the stage.\n\nThe show is called \"Criss Angel Believe\" but should be changed to \"Snooze Trickery Please Leave\"!\n\nI felt like I watching the opening scene of Eddie's Murphy's 1987 Raw standup movie with the kid (little Eddie) telling a silly joke.\n\nThe farcical back and forth sexual innuendo on stage thespianism between Angel and his Tatoo (Herve Villechaize - Ze plane Ze Plane!) sidekick was courtesy laughable to say the least.\n\nI'm not sure how the performance is advertised as a Cirque du Soleil because the only qualifying features would be the Clowns on stage along with a few Bunnies.\n\nI was bored throughout the entire program and almost wanted to purposely take a picture with my IPhone so that I'd be ejected from the theater.\n\nThe only great illusion Criss Angel performed was ripping off the audience with the ridiculous expensive fees to attend the program and fooling them with a stick, white doves and a large black cape.\n\nAnd also Mr. Angel if you're reading this review;  your insecurity dealing with your middle aged belly fat is evident with you trying to conceal your bunny pouch by wearing a black shirt and sniping at it for at least 40-50 times throughout the show.\n\nWith all due respect either lose weight or wear an appropriate loose man fitting shirt during your performance.\n\nIn closing - I would have rather stood outside on the Las Vegas Blvd strip in 100 degrees weather to watch the annoying vendors snap Adult Entertainment (strip clubs) advertisement cards for an hour 1\/2 instead of having to force my eyes and senses to pretend on being interested in the boring sleeplusion show.
