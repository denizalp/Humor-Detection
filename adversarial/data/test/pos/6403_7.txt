Some people want it all\nBut I don't want nothing at all\nIf it ain't you baby.... Norteña de Res o Pollo Torta\n\nOn my quest for the best torta in Phoenix, I surprised my guest and picked up a Norteña de Res o Pollo ($8.99). Fill to the max, this sandwich was stuffed with seasoned grilled chicken, onions and jalapeños, melted cheese, tomato, avocado, chipotle sauce with the refried beans slapped on the bun. How could this be legal? All the ingredients mingled together as each bite grew bigger and bigger. We were fighting for the next bite until there was no more. Note to self: order a second one. This is definitely a \"hearty\" meal. The bun was soft and everything remained intact.  \n\nLuckily, I called in my take out order to avoid waiting in line because the establishment was completely filled during the lunch hour. As I peaked inside, it was a compact eating area with the waitresses hustling to take orders. We thoroughly loved our meal and hope to try it again in the future. \n\nThe restaurant is located in a small mini-mall and parking is available in front. If you plan to visit here, make sure to order any of their 26 tortas because you will not be disappointed. \n\nLos Reyes De La Tora is definitely a contender to be one of the best tortas in Phoenix from us!
