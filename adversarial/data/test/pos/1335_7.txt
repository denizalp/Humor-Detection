We have been enjoying the owners food for years!  This new restaurant is half Carlitos and half Live Fire Q all in one.  You can order from both menus at the same time.  Absolutely amazing!  Red Chile margarita is my favorite from the cocktail menu.  I can't pick a favorite  from the food menu because everything is amazing!  Ftom chicken, sausage and tritip to burritos, Navajo tacos and chile rellenos...it's all amazing!   And they serve breakfast all day. You will go back again again!
