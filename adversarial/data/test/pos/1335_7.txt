A nice place for dinner.\n\nWe rolled in in shorts and t shirts, and they were super nice to us despite the fact that we were obviously quite underdressed.\n\nThe setting is very modern, there's a small menu of well executed dishes. The prices were also very good for the quality of the food. \n\nIt didn't blow any of our minds, but we were all really happy with the food, service and atmosphere. The rooftop patio is also pretty great.
