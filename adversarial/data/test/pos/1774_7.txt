Loved the customer service at the register by Lydia and drinks were made well. However, can't give more than 2 stars because the girl calling out the order (Cindy) had NO personality (sounded like Ben Stine) and did not smile one time. She also pulled out her phone and checked her messages while waiting for blender to finish blending. I will gladly drive a bit farther to get a good coffee AND good customer service.
