Mayne one of the most underrated, unknown karaoke spots in all the Land, Cleveland that is. My first night in here was a real s*** show. I was singing Michael Jackson, Eminem, who knows what else???\n\nThe shots are HUGE and cheap. Almost too much if you ask me. Everything in moderation. A few pool tables, karaoke, heavy shots. All this spells, take me back, ASAP!\n\nBest crowd here, bikers, Ricans, blacks, hipsters (only as of recent) all bind together to make Tinas a legendary venue for anyone who grios the mic. Dont be shy!
