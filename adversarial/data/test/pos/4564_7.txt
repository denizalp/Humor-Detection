Henderson police department sucks!\n\nWent there 2 weeks ago to report a lost drivers license and the fat police officer who was on duty that day told me they dont do police reports for a lost license. I needed that as my embassy needs to file the report and yet they refused to give me a report. Also when I was gonna make a grievance claim against one of their officers who told me to drive without a license, he was adamant and didnt want to give me the form. Dont waste your time complaining with them!
