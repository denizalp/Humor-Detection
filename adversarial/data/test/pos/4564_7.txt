Went here a few weeks back to celebrate my son's engagement. It was about 6pm on a gameday Saturday, so I suspect most of the crowd was still back in Madison. Which was fine with me.  Had a fine time, so I went out here to see where the Tied House placed in terms of ratings, and saw three stars. Oh Gawd, what harm has the Millenial Indignation Squad placed on this place?  If a review starts with 'we had a coupon', stop reading because jeez, really, if student loan debt is really that hard on you that you can't just go out and enjoy life, then maybe you shoulda just went to community college the first two years.\n\nService was off the charts; I suspect it had a bit to do with the fact that my son is a regular. But he has good taste, and if he comes here often, that must mean that the drinks are fresh and the food is huge. Or maybe it's the fresh food and huge drinks. I dunno, tomato, tomahto.\n\nSeveral appetizers were ordered and devoured. I'd say the menu was 'pub food' such as mac-and-cheese bites and Philly Steak but the fried food wasn't greasy and the apps were made by scratch, not frozen.  If those are 'average' cheese curds then you people are spoiled for choice because I thought they were damn good. They have many many taps of beer so nobody should be able to grouse about the lack of selection. \n\nSo, go. Have a beer. Lighten up.
