Alright Mr. Scrib's, you got me hooked! I fell for the Groupon and decided to try your pizza..........boy am I glad I did! I just got done committing a sin in my living room, scarfing down the entire pizza with my husband! I am very picky when it comes to pizza. The truth is, I am a big girl and I love to eat but I won't waste my time eating garbage when I can spend it eating something delicious. I am looking forward to spending more time in the future eating your delicious pizza. I knew the moment I took the first bite that everything was fresh, I could just taste the freshness and the cheese blend and sauce are like none other! Anyone who has the nerve to criticize this pizza is obviously a few slices short of a full pie. To all of those haters, I suggest next time you lay off the illicit drugs and or alcohol before you go back. I am sure once you give it an honest, sober taste, you will agree with me because I am always right. Just ask my husband.
