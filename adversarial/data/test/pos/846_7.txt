Thanks Yelp. I was looking for the words to describe this place and Meh seems fitting.\n\nPlayboy club is located under Moon at the Palms. We got in for free thanks to the promoter hookup we got. First you can't take glassware from Moon down to Playboy. Security will take your glass and transfer the contents over to a plastic cocktail cup making you feel like you are a four year old when all of the big kids downstairs have real glassware.\n\nThere are a couple of tables here to gamble along with some video poker machines at the bar in the back of the club. The atmosphere here is relaxed and seems to cater to an older (40+) crowd. the bunnies here looked miserable, and complained about working. YOU ARE A PLAYBOY BUNNIE!! For the love of god TRY to be happy!\n\nI wouldn't come back here if I had to pay to get in, Playboy is rather small, though intimate. There is limited seating available here, and little to no dancing. Stick to here if you want to be able to hear your date and have a relaxing time. Go somewhere else if you are looking to party it up.
