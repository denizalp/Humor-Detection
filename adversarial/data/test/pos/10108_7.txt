*Blink* I don't get it. \nI'm the easiest person to please when it comes to food. Even Taco Bell tastes like gourmet 5 star cuisine when you're drunk and hungry. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm from the South where we have stellar home cookin', but this place was NOT good. I'm giving it 2 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it definitely was NOT good. \nMy girl friends and I stumbled into this place at 5 or 6am after my bachelorette party because our cabbie recommended it and it was right next to the Riviera where we were staying. \n\nUs: Can we walk back to Riviera in our heels from there?\nCabbie: Girl, you can CRAWL.\n\nNuff said. Let's go THERE.\nWe got a wide variety of stuff- corned beef & hash, biscuits & sausage gravy, buffalo chicken wrap, something else, and something else (sorry, the night was a bit hazy haha). We tried a bite of everyone else's food, and not one of us 5 girls were the least bit impressed. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll go to the 24 hour Indian place inside Riviera if I'm hungry in the middle of the night\/morning. Too bad I didn't find out about it until my last 2 hours there.
