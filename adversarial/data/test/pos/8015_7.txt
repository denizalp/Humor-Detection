I had lunch there yesterday with some folks as part of this month's Yelp Office Hours.  It would fit right in in a retirement community. Right from the monochrome outside paint to the interior.  \n\nI had a grilled cheese sandwich and a cup of clam chowder.  Both were good.  But I think overpriced.  The menu lists the grilled cheese on\" fresh baked sourdough\".  The bread was fresh, but it was French.  Turns out you get the same bread if you order white, French or sourdough.  Not the first time I have run across this.  Some of my dining companions had meals that looked a little more substantial.   The restaurant was nice and clean.  Seating was open and airy and not packed in, even on a Friday.  The overall impression was Meh.\n\nSo why are they so successful?  Everything on the menu is edible.  There seems to be plenty of parking.  Remember when fast food restaurants all had 6 or more lanes?  Well these folks still do and two separate sandwich making stations.  They know how to fill orders in a hurry for the downtown lunch crowd they cater to.  And everybody I dealt with knows how to smile and be friendly and at least seem like they enjoy being there.\n\nIt by itself is not enough draw for me to drive to but I would not put up a fuss if that is where someone suggested to meet.
