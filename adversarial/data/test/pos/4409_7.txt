If you are searching for a home warranty look no further. Customer service is awesome, Jocelyn bent over backwards to make sure my water heater was replaced that day. Gloria and Tracy, part of home residential services (the repair company) were so helpful I cannot begin to describe how great the experience was. I have had old republic and they fix nothing. I have used national many times over four years and have had nothing but good experiences. Do your self a favor and sign on!
