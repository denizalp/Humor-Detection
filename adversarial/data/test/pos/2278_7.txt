Originally opened in the old Garfield's space under the name Latin Fish, but quickly rebranded as Isabela's by Chef Beni Velazquez of Downtown's Bar + Bistro fame, it has been a slow start for the beautiful restaurant set beside a man-made lake off Regatta Drive, and yet sitting down with four friends who know a thing (or ten) about dining around Sin City the results of a chef-selected tasting menu showed plenty of bold flavors and an adept hand for balance, though the run-amok menu and awkward servers remain in desperate need of some tweaks.\n\nSelected as a meeting place in part due to location, but also to see if low marks amongst Yelpers and local 'critics' were anywhere near the truth, it was at prix-fixe with arrangements made directly through Chef Beni that the menu was set, and given plenty of room to spread out amidst a square table in large private room it was with long discussion of the city's dining scene that the twenty-plate lunch unfolded, the opening bites of warm cornbread with three spreads followed by a crabcake atop mashed plantains each highlighting flavors sweet as well as savory, a hallmark of Velazquez culinary roots and good sign of what would come next.\n\nHaving specially requested a handful of plates from Sunday brunch, a menu that might be well served to be offered on Saturday as well considering the large restaurant sat less than 10% full at noon, plate three featured Isabela's highly acclaimed flan French Toast, and with a caramelized exterior overlying a center wet with custard the results were every bit as decadent as might be expected, the follow-up omelet largely lost in the wake of such a delicious concept while the subsequent chicken was awash in butter and garlic, the sherry and herbs unfortunately muddled  in the mix.\n\nRegaining footing quickly, though servers tilting plates saw the first of three spills as a duo of soups were served on the heels of lobster salad stuffed inside toasty golden rolls, suffice it to say that although neither the bisque nor chowder was remotely 'typical' in the least, both bowls were invariably excellent as the former came across sweet and silky while the latter upgraded the New England classic by several notches through the addition of smoky paprika and spicy pork sausage, each bite compelling another until the deceptively deep vessel was completely wiped clean.\n\nReturning to mofongo for plate nine before presenting a pressed panini alongside three styles of fries as the halfway point of our stay, Velazquez's take on his native sandwich was on par with several of those tasted in Miami, a few more pickles potentially placing it above all but the very best, while the funky sliced sweet potatos and Jenga-style fried yucca were each locally beyond compare.\n\nRefreshing palates with the tender chicken salad served atop chopped cabbage and jicama as plaintain chips added texture alongside creamy avocado and sliced Spanish cheese, it was to a small crock of macaroni tinged with red crab that each of us were next treated, the savories coming to a conclusion with two large skillets of paella, the notable lack of socarrat admittedly a bit of a disappointment, though the quality of the prawns and clams amidst rich wafts of saffron certainly did their best to somewhat soften the blow.\n\nAt this point verging on stuffed, the meal having stretched over two-hundred minutes as desserts were presented family style for all to share, it was with a quartet of options that the table was topped, and setting aside more service mispronunciations the question of where to invest limited stomach capacity proved quite the conundrum, the Catalan cream no doubt the lightest option though personal proclivities tilted more towards the steamy white chocolate bread pudding and delicate flan served atop a lightly toothsome base, each creamy bite slightly reminiscent of St. Louis style buttercake.\n\nStill an evolving concept, and one with plenty of room to grow in terms of service while a scaling back of the menu's scope would allow the kitchen an opportunity to really dial-in flavors and textures both, one hopes that Isabela's will soon find its audience because with a beautiful room and a truly passionate Chef it'd be a real shame to see another failure for a restaurant attempting to challenge the Summerlin status quo.
