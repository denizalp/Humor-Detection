DO NOT GET A FRENCH MANICURE HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO COMMIT A HUGE FASHION SIN!!\n\nWhat constitutes a \"huge fashion sin\" in the world of french manicures? Umm..how about thick, crooked white tips with blurry lines that fade into the pink portion of your nail (not crisp AT ALL) and looks like a 5-year old kid decided to play with mommy's cosmetics?? Yeap. That's what happened.\n\nOkay - you're probably thinking to yourself, \"if you didn't like it, you should have just told them so they could fix it until they got it right\". Hold on, girlfriend. I sure did - for the first 15 minutes of the manicure...but there comes a point during the manicure process where you realize that - hey - this aesthetician is just not getting it and you're better off just painfully going through it. Gahhh. \n\nTo clarify - i'm not even one of those picky, prissy girls who insists everything has to be perfect, but let's just say that this french manicure was a major FAIL. Even my boyfriend who doesn't notice stuff like when I get haircuts took note that my nails were a hot mess....that's when you know it's bad!!!\n\nI haven't used the other services at Revelations, so I can't comment on that, but I can definitely tell you that their french manicures suck.  I even got it in shellac\/gel, so I can't even remove it myself!!!\n\nDON'T DO IT. Or if you want to do it and have fugly nails, be my guest.
