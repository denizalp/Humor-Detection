What am I doing? Reviewing parking decks? I strangely have a strong opinion about the quality of  decks.\n\nI parked here for about a year and this is a fantastic parking deck. It's relatively new. It has a employee there every weekday. The design of the deck is very smart and efficient. It's energy efficient. It's connected to the overstreet mall. It had a slightly better price point than the decks a block away. And it allowed monthly commuters to park here anytime (sporting events included - nice because it is literally right next to TWC arena). It's not owned by the 'preferred parking' monopoly.\n\nI will say the wintertime had a few issues with the freezing of gates. But that's about the only thing I dislike. If you are looking for a monthly deck and you park on the side of town, use this deck. The only reason I stopped using the deck was because I moved jobs.
