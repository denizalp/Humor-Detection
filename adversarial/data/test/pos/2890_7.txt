FYI: My $18-stylist Noelia has advanced to the next level and now she's $35. Still a great deal, IMHO. \n\nWhile Noelia was off to train in the coloring program, I got another cut from a different haircutter, Anastasia, who is currently $25. She was also fab!\n\nBe sure to book early because now that the word is out, appointments are getting harder and harder to get :( I shoulda never opened my big mouth.
