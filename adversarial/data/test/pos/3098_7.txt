Okay I have to admit I was excited to go to my first late night glow in the dark bingo with a DJ.  I have also never played bingo at a bingo hall (I guess I usually think of that as something for senior citizens) and didn't know what to expect.  The music was pretty good and also loud (which was fine), although they didn't lower it much during the announcer talking, so it wasn't always easy to tell what she was saying or what she was calling out.  We looked at the large ceiling screens a lot to figure out what number she was calling, but she called so fast that it was hard to keep up.  We were usually trying to find the numbers on the screen from the previous call and she was already on to the next one.  \n\nThe only huge complaint I have is it seemed there was virtually NO smoke ventilation.  I have never seen so many people smoking cigarettes in one place and I HATE cigarette smoke.  If they had good ventilation, I wouldn't mind, but we were literally suffocated by the smoke.  I liked the music, the bar and the snack bar was decent, but please find some way to get rid of at least some of the smoke.  I definitely won't be back since it is so bad, it seems like you could almost get lung cancer in just one night.\n\nOn a side note, when walking through the casino, I saw what I thought was a snack machine and thought I would grab a candy bar, but when I went up to it, it was completely full of cigarettes - surprise surprise.   This place is good for people who smoke cigarettes non-stop and not good for just about everyone else.
