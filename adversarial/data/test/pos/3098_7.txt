Love the pizza every one I've tried has been amazing! The rest of the food has WAY too much garlic and is over seasoned! It makes me think that they don't use the freshest products, if not why else would they need to mask the flavors of the seafood and meat?\n4 starts for over seasoning, a good chef doesn't need to mask the flavors of their food if they're using the freshest ingredients.
