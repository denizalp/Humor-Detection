This goes back to the early 90's when Mr Steve Wynn had built the Mirage in 89 and TI  in 93. This tram was designed to keep Mr Wynns guests trek to his properties as comfortable and convenient as possible. Fast forward 20 years later and its a bit amusing that Mirage is now an MGM property and Mr Ruffin owns the TI...but I digress..\n\nThis tram is always clean and cool and runs constantly and quickly. I used to enjoy staying at the Mirage before moving here, so I have used this tram numerous times.On the TI side you just go up the escalators by the Mystere theater and go past the shops to the end of the hallway and there you are!\n\nBest of all...its FREE!\n\n4 stars.
