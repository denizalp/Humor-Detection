I love going to the done right with a friend to chat (it's quiet enough) and observe the locals. it's always interesting, as you can see from the other reviews here too. they also have some decent beers on tap, which is super important. (i think i drink mcdonald or something when i'm there).\n\nthe regulars are so friendly too, usually a bit too drunk and they just enter your conversation like it's the most natural thing in the world.\n\nonly 4 stars because the service can be sort of unenthusiastic and the bathrooms are pretty bad (no mirror in one, leaks on the floor, bad smells). on the other hand the service is sometimes really awesome, but here's my story:\n\ntwo summers ago i ended up at the done right often on a sunday afternoon with my friend. we'd finish our shifts around 5 or 6 and go hang out on their patio drinking gin bloody mary's\/caesars. i'm vegan so i get them made with tomato juice. the bar tenders would sometimes add all kinds of stuff in addition to horse radish like olives and it was awesome. but this particular time the bitchy server ran out of tomato juice so i ran across the street to buy some at the convenience store (after i've spent like $20 on these expensive double shot drinks) and she still charged me full price (like $7-8?) for the drink.\n\nregardless, i still like to go here and bring along some good company, but i don't mind being earlier than my date either since it's such an entertaining place to be.
