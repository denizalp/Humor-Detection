I had an unbelievably negative experience with J.P.s towing. I get that being a tow truck driver likely comes with a lot of harsh feelings being directed to you, however I don't think that justifies being a full on jerk.\n\nI was biking home from work along Dundas and a guy from J.P.'s proceeded to block an entire streetcar from continuing down the street. Being a cyclist I also was blocked. The JPs guy was not towing a car, was not hooked up to anything... he was just being defiant to the streetcar who was ringing a bell at him. When I asked if he could take a step in so everyone could pass, the driver got in my face and threatened me. The TTC driver intervened, as did a parking cop, so I was able to go around him.\n\nI called JPs towing to follow up on this incident--spoke to a very helpful woman on the phone and was connected to the Manager. He was apologetic, however did say he'd follow up with a formal apology about the incident--which was never received.\n\nPerhaps they are good at towing people which is a thankless job...but poor handling of a very upsetting situation.
