Okay...I have to admit. I wasn't a fan of this gym when I first stepped foot in here a couple of years ago.  I had a quick workout back then and a lot of the machines, including cardio, were down.  That was then, this is now.  Either management changed or this Gold's stepped it up.  \n\nI recently became a member just to change things up.  Plus, this location is a hop, skip, and a jump away from my house.  \n\nWhen it comes to me reviewing a gym, I look at cleanliness, equipment, and ambiance. Here are my thoughts so far;\n\nCardio:  Located upstairs and plenty of it.  You have multiple flat screens to past the time.  Even better, this gym has a cardio theater, which can be perfect for Low Intensity Steady State Cardio.  Located upstairs is also their classes, TRX area, and spin classes.  \n\nMachines:  A mix of Life Fitness Machines and Hammer Strength.  I'm not the biggest fan of Life Fitness Equipment. The only exceptions are their leg machines.  But I am a fan of Hammer Strength and there's a ton of it.  \n\nFree-Weights:  Enough benches, power racks, and weights.  A great addition to their free-weights is their squat bar, corner rows, and even a deadlift\/shrug contraption.  My only issue with their free weights is their lack of dumbbells between 10 lbs and 35 lbs. Either these lbs are nonexistent or they're lying around somewhere in the gym.  There's still a ton of the monster DB's though\n\nRest Rooms:  Only reviewing the men's, lol.  Huge locker room with a lounge to decompress, maybe watch some TV.  \n\nTanning Rooms:  For additional charge, you can tan here.  Not for me, but just throwing it out there. \n\nThe staff here is excellent.  Cesar knows his stuff and gave me advice on my membership without trying to push for commission.  The gym is also clean and this time around, their equipment is all in great working order. \n\nPS:  Like all other gyms, this one gets busy.  I drive by here often and notice the parking lot during the peak times is crazy.  My suggestion, get in early or really late.  \n\nYeah Buddy!!!
