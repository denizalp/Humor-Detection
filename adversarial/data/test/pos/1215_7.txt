From October to April, the drive-in is the business.  Not only is it dirt cheap but you get to bring in your own food, booze, blankets and anything else your vehicle can carry.  Plus you get to watch two movies for the price of one, cha-ching!  The lines for the concession stand can get out of control so get there early or be prepared to miss some of the movie.  This has got to be one of my favorite things to do in the valley because we can all pile in the bed of my pick-up under a bunch of blankets and watch the latest flick on a huge screen.  Even though it's in a really sketchy area, I've never encountered or seen any type of violence or inappropriate behavior, just an occasional whiff of sweet stinky reefer.
