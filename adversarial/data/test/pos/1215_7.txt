This pizza is completely terrible. The service is garbage as well. On the plus side, there is hot sauce and it isn't terribly expensive. \n\nIf you are completely stoned out of your mind, this is perfect. Also, a better pizza cannot be found in the pizza desert known as Montr√©al. This city is to pizza what hell is to soft breezes.
