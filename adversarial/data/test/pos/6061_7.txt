Told this was one of the places to go when in Madison---ummm no. The MOST rated restaurant on Yelp--really? On a Thursday after a productive week, we  headed over to the State Capital. I was seriously excited!  Was going to try the Bird Cage that everyone has posted, and would try the cheese curds, Mac and Cheese and possibly some form of meat. Was really in it for the Bird Cage and new friends. Parking is NOT easy. There is construction right in front yet found a meter which stops at 6 pm. SCORE. Goes down hill after parking and seeing the drink menu.  \n\nExpected to wait, it was Thursday and a perfectly beautiful day in Madison. We were seated quickly, Also SCORE. Had someone take our drink order as well as bring 1 more menu as we were given 1 less than needed. When drinks came, the guy disappeared so fast some of our party was mid sentence trying to order. They were NOT that busy to be running away from a question or order. New server at the helm and ready. \n\nOur server may have been having a rough day, she seemed off, but she did the job. Had the Lazy Susan, the 1st one. The pate i could not figure if it was chicken, duck or goose. Deviled eggs OK, nothing spectacular, salmon did not seem fresh, Hearring, well it is an acquired taste. Salami and white cheese were good, White was better than orange cheese. It had no taste. Was it worth the 16 dollars for the Ritz and a few slices of bread, meh not so much but OK. Get me that Bird Cage, bring us the Mac and Cheese, bring us a few burgers 1 with an egg. This is THE place to be. Still had optimistic hopes\n\nSadly no more Bird Cage? Wha?!!!?! Huge Bummer. Burgers were cooked order. I had the spicy burger and friend had regular. I did not taste any extra spice, but I appreciated it being medium rare. Bacon was good. I had the bunless and egg. They charge 1.50 for a bun and a 1.00 for the egg. Cheese curds were good, but lost on 1\/2 of us, but happy we had a chance to try.  I have tried them and now can say I did. Burgers come with fries or salad. I opted for salad, dressing had no flavor, so I asked for a different 1. No flavor again. Gave up, had enough to call it a dinner.  Egg was cooked nicely. OK meal. Not too expensive except the Lazy Susan...not really worth the price tag.  No Bird Cage. Large Whiskey and Beer selection, decent wine and on the back of the drink menu it said Booze. Funny. \n\nReady to call it a night waiting for the check. One of our dishes was the Mac and Cheese. This was supposed to be the signature dish. It was cooked awful. It tasted like they messed up the flour to cheese and butter ratio. It was not good. We left 2\/3 rds on the table. Mentioned this to the server not having the best day and she did not say anything, zero zilch. Also one of our glasses was chipped. We handed that over. Again, nothing was said. Nothing was fixed. \nSeriously!!??!?!! My last statement was, you may not want to serve that again, it was not good. Again nothing. Not even, gosh that sucks, or sorry, or thanks for bringing me the glass that could have cut one's lip...nada. Left a bad impression. \n\nWhy someone would wait in line for more than 15 minutes is something I do not comprehend. If the lunch was served quickly for the downtown workers, I would see this as a regular albeit OK spot, but nothing to write much more about. \n\nIf coming for your Epic training, this is not one of the must have to try places.
