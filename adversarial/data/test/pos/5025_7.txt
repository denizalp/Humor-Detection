Went for an early dinner on Sunday (around 4pm) and was surprised to find the place packed. We were seated quickly but the place looked full to us. Man they have a lot of employees at this place. I've never seen so many serving and waitstaff as I seen here. Unfortunately we must have got one of the new or untrained ones as she did a couple of things that are pet peeves of mine which took away points for service. She did keep our drinks full but we had the following service issues.\n\n1. She asked us if she \"could get dessert started for us\" shortly after we were served our food. We had not even dented our meal and she's asking us about dessert?\n\n2. She gave us our check the same time she asked us if we wanted dessert, midway through the meal. This causes a couple of problems, one you feel the need to clean off your hands to dig out your credit card to pay when you're in the middle of eating. I decided not to do this and just continue to eat and then had to deal with her continuously coming by to look and see if we put the card out for her yet.\n\n3. She NEVER removed a dish when we were done with our meal. We had four dinner plates, bread plates, appetizer plates, refilled and empty drink glasses and of course peanut buckets stacked on our table after we finished and had paid and she came back and told us thanks and dropped off the receipt. All the dishes were left on the table and we had to leave just to get away from the mess on the table as we could not sit and finish our iced tea.\n\n4. While people were walking out of the place a male employee, who went to great lengths to let you know he is homosexual ( I have no problem with him being homosexual just putting it here so management can identify who I'm talking about) comes walking down the aisle with nothing in his hands and makes every customer stop and step aside for him as he struts down the aisle. He would not stop and get out of the customers way. I watched him continue to do it the entire time we were there so when I went to walk out I purposely didn't get out of his way and continued walking down the aisle and he got right in my face and said \"excuse me\" and stood there until I moved out of his way. He caught me off guard as I was sure he would move aside as I pushed forward but he wasn't about to let me through so out of embarrassment from his saying loudly \"excuse me\" I moved for him.\n\nThe food was good and a manager stopped by shortly after our arrival and I wished it would have been further into the meal so I could have let her know of the issues. When we were done we just wanted to get out of there and away from the table and all the dishes (and rib bones) stacked in front of us.
