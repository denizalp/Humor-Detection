Location is downtown near the Eau Claire market, and my YMCA search continues.  \n\nLuckily my neighbour works at this Y, and he has kindly given me passes to general locker room access and women's plus facilities.\n\nFirst of all let me start with location, this is very central, downtown to be exact so what is our first hurdle? Parking! Parking downtown can be such a beyotch.  \n\nChoices range from anywhere at Eau Claire market to surface parking with park plus at 5 to 8 dollars an hour, yes you read me correctly between 6am to 5 pm. Or simply pay an early bird rate of $25 dollars - $28 dollars maximum for the whole day.  If you go to the gym 3 times a week this will cost you well you do the math. Damnnnnn.  \n\nSo your best bet is the Calgary Curling Club during peak hours of 5 am - 6pm, which is one dollar for the first four hours and then 2 dollars thereafter.  This is located at 720 3 Street NW.\n\nAfter 5pm, 2 dollars flat rate at Eau Claire market or surface parking and again your best bet is Calgary Curling Club which is free.  My head is in a confused tizzy, what the heck just take a bus there.\n\nOkay let's get to the facility, nice facility, clean with two swimming pools, an indoor runny track, cardio and weight equipment and 50 drop in classes each week. There are two fitness studios, a full size gym, and a squash and racquetball\/handball court.   This is all accessible at $59.11 a month and this Membership fee gives you access to all YMCAs in the city.\n\nNow the beauty about this gym is that you have a Membership plus upgrade which gets you  whirlpool and steam pool access, private exercise and TV lounge area, you are given towel service and personal care products and there is laundry service but this is for men only. This is $77.31 a month for women and $91.53, wow that laundry perk is 20 bucks more, but then again have you done a man's laundry? \n\nThere is also personal training staff that can assist you with personal training and you can anywhere from 1 to 40 sessions.\n\nMy visits have so far been very pleasant especially the member plus option, the comfy towels, blow dryers and curling irons are a nice touch, but what I love the most is the whirlpool and steam room comforts! \n\nThe service is impeccable and the staff is extremely friendly, so if a downtown location is what you need you have several great options at this facility.  \n\nI am docking a star because I think there should be a much affordable parking perk built in to the YMCA membership.
