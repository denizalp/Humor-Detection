My daughter loved her cheese enchilada, rice and beans for lunch.  I loved the rice, the beans were good but the green chili burrito tasted wayyyyyyyy too salty and the beef tasted like it was canned beef  The service was fabulous as we were never without a full drink, chips, salsa, or bean dip and even requested a spicier sauce for the chips and that was fantastic!! .  I would go back but would not order the green chili burrito.
