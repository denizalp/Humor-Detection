This place sucks. It is not a safe environment for women. We were verbally threatened by a man repeatedly as we were trying to ignore him and he almost physically assaulted my friend before our waitress caught him and told him to leave us alone. The owners Brad and Curtis did not seem to take this situation seriously. The man was belligerently drunk and they kicked him out. Now they are allowing a belligerently drunk man drive a car. I just hope that everyone on the road is safe tonight. This place is horribly ran, and we are being treated like crap from owners and security because we were harassed. For comparison at parkway tavern, there would be no questions asked, the man would have been thrown out immediately and we would not need to provide any \"story\". This place has made me so angry. Never coming here ever again and I'll be sure to spread the word to everyone I know.
