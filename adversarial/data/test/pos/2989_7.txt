This Sephora location has awesome customer service! As soon as I walked into the store, there were two ladies waiting to greet customers. She pointed me to the Kat Von D section. The struggle for good liquid eyeliner is always REAL! Towards the afternoon I always find eyeliner in the crease, but I don't have that issue with this miracle liner! I stopped by here when I was visiting Vegas to pick up this amazing eyeliner and I am glad I did.\n\nNo line at all. Score!\nQuickly in and out. Score!\nWorkers are cheerful & helpful. Score!\nHUGE selection. Score!\n\nI wish I could come here often since this store has everything I like.
