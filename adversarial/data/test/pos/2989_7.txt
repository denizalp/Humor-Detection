Worst customer service, EVER!!  Is it because I'm young and not the right kind of Asian to get you to ask me if I need help? I stood around for 20 minutes waiting to get my size and still no one helped me. Maybe they were intimidated by my Louis Vuitton purse? Let me lastly add, the store had only 4 customers in it, including my friend, and no staff member paid us the time of day. Shameful.
