Unlike other reviewers,we had no trouble finding a parking place. But our big problem was trying to figure out why anyone would want to come here in first place. \n\nDuring recent lunch-hour weekday visit (place was essentially empty except for two guys at bar, a bewildered tourist trying to figure out what was going on and a few employees, one on floor painting signs), you may well feel you have  stumbled into some sort of boho work-in-progress in an old block-long warehouse in charm-free neighborhood south of downtown proper. \n\nCheery young female employee who greeted us tried to explain what the mind-reeling business operation was all about--but it was pretty clear she wasn't very sure herself.  Is it a bar? A  gym? A restaurant? A clothing store? A concert venue? A tax write-off? Take your pick.\n\nWalk into this industrial cavern and you must immediately navigate a weird obstacle course fronted by a boxing ring (a souvenir from a past tenant? who knows? and why put it right in front there when rest of building has plenty of other space?) , followed by a few makeshift kiosks stocked with a smattering of tee shirts, vintage clothing and several faux retro cookbooks. \n\nOn one side of building is a non-operative supposedly soon-to-open soda fountain. . .or so we were told, even though other reviewers have raved about it. On other side  is a bar where we unsuccessfully attempted to order iced tea (probably only place in Phoenix that doesn't serve it) and got dirty look from surly young bartender in the process.\n\nAppeared to be some sort of dining area in open storage yard\/garage  to the rear but at this point, who cared? A very bizarre, over-hyped establishment attempting  to fill a merchandising niche that probably doesn't even exist.
