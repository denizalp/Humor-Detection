THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB!!  I've been making my own sausages for years and I've never found a local spot that offers top quality gear for decent prices.....let alone awesome prices. Its a bit off the beaten path over on 52nd St SE but this place has high-quality restaurant\/kitchen supplies and and they must be a wholesaler or something because their prices are way below what I'm used to.  They are the only place in Calgary with a wide variety of fresh sausage casings (they also stock the collagen brands) and all the sausage making equipment (i.e.. grinders, stuffers, mixers) have stood the test of time in my homemade butcher shop so far.....not to mention they were way cheaper than any other place in Cowtown.  They even have a crazy test kitchen where they do Butchering and Sausage Making Classes from a well known German chef and butcher.  My girlfriend and I managed to get into the butchering class last week (very romantic I know) and it was packed with people and lots of fun!  \n\nIf you a hunter\/fisherman, own your own restaurant or if you just want a place for cheap kitchen supplies (huge selection of German HinkeI and high-quality Japanese knives for dirt cheap) then check this place out. I usually find an excuse to go to at least every two weeks and I'm never disappointed.  I think they are open Saturdays during hunting season!
