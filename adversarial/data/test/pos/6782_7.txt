How fun! Boom Boom La Rue is feathers galore! If you are in need of a stunning head piece (who isn't at some time) this is the place to go. The store has many, many beautiful models on display. If you'd like a custom piece the owner, Sherman, can work his magic. (Note: He is generally in the store after 4pm. No photos posted as they are not allowed. I asked!)\n\nGirly costumes and accessories abound. Sizing generally is geared more for men. I skipped away with incredibly unique necklaces and earrings. I was shocked at how reasonable the pricing is. Scoop up false eyelashes, wigs, shoes (again, for men, or women with larger sizing needs), hosiery, gloves, crystals and makeup. Oh! And boas!\n\nThe lovely gentlemen who helped me had the patience of a saint. (Even though I must have asked to see half the necklaces on sale :)\n\nThere are *so* many options you'll be excited for your next costume need. I know I am!\n\n(Be sure to check-in on Yelp. After I left I realized there was a 'Buy $75 for $50 offer. AND free stick on nails with purchase. Oof!)
