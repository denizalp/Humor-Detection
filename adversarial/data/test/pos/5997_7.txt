Those who claim Toronto lacks greenery won't know what hit them when they see Rogue Park for the first time! It is as close to the wilderness as you're gonna find near an urban centre. \n\nTo be honest, I haven't visited since I was little, but my memories resemble The Green Forest (remember that awesome animated series from yester-year?). I imagined myself a misunderstood heroine in a Disney film and all the creatures were my pals as we wandered through the majestic forest singing about unrequited love (which to a five year old is the same as the ice cream that fell off the cone). I also went here on school field trips and I loved learning about the plants and trees.\n\nWhere am I going with this?\n\nAnyway, the park is truly amazing, but I do believe it's easier to get to by car then TTC- but I could be wrong. It's one of those places you need to see to appreciate. A historically preserved site that is passionately maintained. You can camp, hang out on the beach, wander through a forest - what more can you ask for?
