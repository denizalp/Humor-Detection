Their website clearly states that a walk-in visit, out-of-pocket costs $99.00. Fortunately, I have insurance (or not) -- my insurance has been billed a grand total of $515.00 for a 30-minute consultation with the doctor on a Saturday morning. I think this is robbery! (they charged an extra $92 for an \"urgent\" visit - not sure why that's in addition to $323.00 office visit charge, PLUS an additional $67 for a weekend visit). Yowza!\nBasically, I had a very brief discussion with the doctor about my concerns -- there was NO physical examination, lab tests or any other diagnostic testing done. I am extremely disappointed that they would take advantage of my health insurance -- PLUS, I just got an additional bill for $73.00! Yikes!\nUnless you are dying, you are better off waiting 'til you can see your own PCP -- it will be cheaper and won't drain our US healthcare system. These clinics are costing us more than we think!!!!!!!!
