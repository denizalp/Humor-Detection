Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! This place has some really awesome seats that recline and are super comfy. The problem...well you see in order to sit in these wonderful seats you must bring your own cleaning wipes and trash can. First off, the floor was not swept. Luckily it wasn't sticky but still a quick run through could have fixed this. However, in the scheme of things this is not a reason I would not return. The reason I will not be returning is the filth in the seats. All four seats in my party had something disgusting going on. Some were sticky, had used napkins, and chocolate on them. I was happy I had some wet wipes in my purse, but this is not okay. I will not be back until I hear they started cleaning their theaters.
