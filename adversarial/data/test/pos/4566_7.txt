Danny and his team are awesome and amazing! Since this was the first time I owned a home in many years, I had very little knowledge of the whole process involved in purchasing a home. I had lots of questions, and Danny was always there promptly and patiently to guide me through the process and offer moral support. Even after I closed on the home, Danny contacted me to make sure everything was still going smoothly. I would definitely recommend Myriad with flying colors for your real estate needs.
