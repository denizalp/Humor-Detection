Came here with a friend because we were craving dessert. Had terrible and rude service and our server told us we needed to order X amount of items or else they would not serve us. Server never checked up on us so I just left a dollar tip and got up to leave. Afterwards the server ran up to me and demanded more of a tip. If I'm not mistaken tips are optional and I already tipped a dollar for the terrible service. But I gave an extra 3 dollars as they demanded more tips. Would never come back.
