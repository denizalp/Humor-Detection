Definitely not worth the $88 my husband and I spent.  There are waaaay better buffets in Las Vegas and the casino buffet I usually go to in San Diego (where I'm from) is 100x better than Wicked Spoon. \n\nCosmopolitan is an overrated, overhyped place.  It looks beautiful in Wicked Spoon, but their food was too \"hipster\" for me.  Sriracha lime watermelon?  Wasabi mashed potatoes?  Over salty bone marrow?  I'll pass!  I like high quality food with less gimmicks.  There was not one dish that satisfied me.  They didn't even have seafood here.  *insert WTF face* Will never go back here and will not ever recommend. \n\n2 stars for the fast and friendly service and pretty decor.
