Location: 7287 Yonge St, Thornhill, ON L3T 2A9\nPrice: $\nService: alright \n\nThis is a short review since I only came by for a gelato. The service was alright since the server was really friendly. I didn't enjoy this visit as much because the server recommended two gelato ice cream that clearly doesn't go well together... Haha to each their own. Other than that there is not much I can review. However, I would visit again to try their freshly made pizzas! \n\nVerdict: To be continued...
