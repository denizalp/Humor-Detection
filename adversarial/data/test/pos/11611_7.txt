Food is mediocre. Fries tasted of rancid old oil. We ordered our burgers well done to go and when we got home we saw that they were both medium rare. Sauce on the side was missing. You have to try really hard to screw up an order in so many different ways. Do not recommend.... There were better burger places in the vicinity.
