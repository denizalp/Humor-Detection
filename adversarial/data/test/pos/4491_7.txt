\"Fry that fish!\" \n\nI'll admit it here I cannot fry fish nor  chicken and oh what a shame it is because I love me some fried chicken.  I went to Hooks Fish and Chicken with only 15 minutes to spare before my bus came, I was in and out and the service was prompt and friendly. I even shared a laugh with the cashier. \n\nI ordered a whiting dinner with three wings. My food was prepared while I waited.  The fish and chicken was seasoned so well just the right amount of garlic which for me means tons of garlic. My the fish dinner was a hearty serving and was enough to be both a lunch and dinner later that night. \n\nHaving fried foods is one of the best ways to turn a day from good to great! Thanks Hooks for the great service and stellar meal.
