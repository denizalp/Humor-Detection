Not really sure why this place is rated at 3 stars.  Orient Kitchen is probably the only really decent authentic Chinese I have had here in the Pittsburgh area.  Below is a brief listing of what I tried:\n\nPan fried seafood noodles:  true to tradition, the edges of the egg noodles are delicate crispy and soft where the sauce meets the noodle.  Plenty of seafood toppings though I think there should be a few more shrimps.\n\nLong clams (razor clams) - I really do not know any place that has this and it is a must have.  Cooked just right and not rubber and the right spices here.\n\nLive lobster made your way!  Ginger and scallions or the salt and pepper method with a reasonable price based on size is also a must here.\n\nFresh steamed fish, also live from the tank!  Nothing beats fresh.\n\nI totally recommend for a traditional Chinese feast. They have been in business here for a long, long time...
