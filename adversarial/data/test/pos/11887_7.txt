Every once in a while, you have an experience that reminds you of the way things are.  And you know what?  There's just no better way to clarify once and for all how disgustingly lopsided America's class system has become than a trip to Sprinkle's.  \n\nA friend from Cali just had to go here and so I was brought along.  I watched with a mixture of amusement and anger as silicone-stuffed Scottstitutes lined up one after another to pay over $3 for 5 cents worth of ingredients in a box.  I wondered, \"what sort of moron pays $36 for 12 cupcakes?\"  I'll answer that question for you: someone with more money than intellect.  My friend insisted I couldn't judge their decisions until I purchased one myself.  I grudgingly forked over my $3.25 for a Dark Chocolate cupcake.\n\nWith near Willy Wonka-esque inefficiency, the ladies behind the counter finally presented me with my cupcake which had been placed in a box and sealed with a sticker.  I can't imagine a more wasteful way to disburse with a single baked good.  I'm sure part of the $3.25 pays for this cardboard and sticker which will be promptly discarded by the consumer.\n\nOn to the cupcake itself.  It was good.  Not great, but good.  I'll make no excuses; it tasted nice.  The cake tasted like it should and the frosting was soft.  It tasted like something mom might have made when you were kid.  With that said, my mother would never have spent $3.25 on a cupcake.  I have no problem with paying more for considerably better food or expertise in preparation.  But you can't tell me that there's a rocket science to making cupcakes.  This is purely conspicuous consumption for people with lots of extra cash and very little going on.  How is it that in a country with more than 45 million without healthcare, the wealthy have nothing better to do with their money than the purchase of designer cupcakes?  \n\nMy advice: do something better with your money.  You'll weigh less and feel better.  And if you want a cupcake, go to the store and buy the ingredients to make a dozen.  Cupcakes are not exactly tough to make.  And with the $30 or so you have left, buy some food for your local shelter or food pantry.
