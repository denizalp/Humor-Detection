WORST. PLACE. EVER!\n\nWow. Really, this was the WORST cup of coffee I've ever had.....EVER!\n\nHow.......how can one mess up a mexi mocha? I'll tell you.....by DROWNING it in cinnamon. I kept wondering if I was in a cinnamon challenge. So, almost nine bucks for disgusting coffee and i TIPPED for that.....WTF! This is why I stick with Dunkin Donuts and The Human Bean. So far, those guys haven't let me down yet!\n\nThis place = NO BUENO!!!!
