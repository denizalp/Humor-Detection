My husband and I decided on a quiet Christmas and this weekend we took each other out to two surprise dinners. Tonight I took him to see SLS and its interesting historic references, the video Center Bar, the giant kaleidoscope, the carpets, chandeliers and Monkey Bar.\nCleo was good- we shared the wonderful spicy potatoes with cilantro, the flavorful chicken kebabs, the roast lamb which was very tender, and raw oysters. We had the bakhlave and the hot apple cinnamon tart with vanilla gelato. Servers were really helpful. One craft beer and one riesling later we paid about $128.00.\nWe liked the ambience although the location means the music from the casino area pushes its way in.\nAll in all a very enjoyable meal!
