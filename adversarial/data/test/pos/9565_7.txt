I can understand how the cozy and intimate space has been, and will be, missed. But in my eyes, the new location is modern, innovative, and just beautiful. And, most importantly, the quality of most of the dishes has not skipped a beat.\n\nDerek and I returned to Crop recently to partake of a Sunday supper. We did NOT have the kids! YAAAAAAY (um, can you tell I've been cooped up in the house too long with a newborn?). While I kinda wished I'd had the opportunity to linger over the regular menu and take forever to make my decision, it was fine to have just the options of the dishes they were serving that night for $30\/person.\n\nFor a cocktail, I had the porch swing. Weeeeee! Drunk after 2 sips. We had the truffle popcorn which was a little weird in my opinion. The popcorn wasn't crunchy, just kind of chewy. Normal? I don't know; I'd never tried their balsamic popcorn either. \n\nWe had a huge, colorful, tasty salad (they called it their \"Late Summer Salad\"). It had golden and red beets, grapes, melon, arugula, and more. It was delicious and plentiful! My only criticism would be that it was a little overdressed with what the server referred to as \"Balsamic Vin\" -- LOL.\n\nFor our entrees, Derek had the cherry-braised short ribs served with cornbread and I had the pappardelle with a mushroom sauce.  Derek said that his was a bit vinegary, but overall he liked it a lot. I was in love with the pasta and the sauce's flavor, but the mushrooms in the dish were HUGE and I am not too down with that. I prefer my mushrooms chopped up a little more -- that is probably declasse. Whatever!\n\nThe sides were smashed potatoes and ratatouille. Both were fine. Nothing to write home about, and actually the potatoes needed a little seasoning.\n\nDessert was a pumpkin pie-type-thing, which was AWESOME and served with dried cranberries and some kind of sugared pecans or something of that nature. Mmm. The reason I enjoy this meal in general is that it allows you to try things you ordinarily wouldn't. I was so glad to be \"forced\" to eat this pumpkin dessert, because when given the chance I'd have probably gone with something chocolate in nature.\n\nThe only complaint I had about this was that we were never offered coffee with our dessert, and then the bill was just placed on the table before we could ask. Do they not serve coffee for Sunday Supper -- anybody know?\n\nService was great, as usual. The four star rating is just because we didn't ABSOLUTELY LOVE our meals this time like the other times. \n\nI don't really think that the space is too big. It's just that the sound isn't absorbed by the velvet couches, etc. anymore that makes it seem so vast in there. That, and the ridiculously tall ceiling, which is actually a great feature because of the artistic design of the ceiling. The space really is a work of art, as is the food. Instead of thinking of what has been, consider Crop Bistro to be a really great place right NOW. And it will probably only get better.
