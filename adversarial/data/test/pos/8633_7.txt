Calgary transit, you suck.\n\nA typical day in Calgary requires one to freeze their ass off at a little snow-piled bus stop bench. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Realizing the bus will never come, one is required to walk almost 30 minutes to the Train station. \nMore standing, waiting, freezing.\nUnless you're early (or incredibly late), the train is packed with dozens of equally grumpy people. \nScraping the gum stuck to the floor off your boot, you exit the train only to realize that you just paid $2.75 for what most cities will charge $2.25 for, and offer better service with more routes and longer operating times.\nThere's a reason Mcleans Magazine voted Calgary Transit the worst major City Public Transit system.
