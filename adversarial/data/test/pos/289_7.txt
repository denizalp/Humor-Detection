I grew up on beans and cheese. I would be happy the rest of my life if all I ate could be bean and cheese burritos. I'm a simple gal. However, even simple gals know when they are dining at a great Mexican joint.\n\nI've been to Casa Don Juan a few times. Inviting  staff are always present to great me, and the severs are always attentive and kind as well.\n\nSome of my favorites have been the Cheese Tamales and the Chicken Tacos. This time around I had the Caesar Salad with grilled chicken, because, let's face it, I can't eat bean and cheese burritos everyday. \n\nThe tamales are filling, sometimes a little bit dry but still great. The tacos are great as well, not too heavy and very tasty. And my salad, well it's salad, but it's good! The grilled chicken is savory. I also love that they serve refried beans with their chips, because it's one way that I can get my bean craving fulfilled.\n\nI have always ordered a Strawberry Margarita on the rocks with my meal here. I don't know why, it's just some weird craving. This frosty treat is a little dessert in a way. This time around, the margaritas weren't all that frosty (even a tad bit room temperature). It was a bummer, but since I've been here a few times, I know that's not the standard.\n\nI will be back, of course.
