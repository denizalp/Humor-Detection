I am kind of torn about how to rate this place.  I will never eat here again, and I have had better fried chicken, but none cheaper or closer to my house than that of chick-n-joy.  I feel like I would have liked the ambiance more pre-renovations... I have never been before, but I know in my heart that it used to be cooler.\n\nThe good:\n- the lunch special is dirt cheap.  $4.50 for a 2pc chicken and fries combo with a pop. \n- the gravy is spectacular.  Don't be alarmed by it's fluorescent luminescence.\n- Fries are better than average.\n- I don't eat a lot of fried chicken (like less than once a year) but this was better than what I remember having from KFC but not as good as a stockyards buttermilk dipped chicken piece (the only fried chicken I will entertain).\n\nThe bad:\n- it was SO greasy.  Seriously.  I have washed my hands twice and I am still greasing my keyboard.  It's extremely disgusting.\n- no parking.\n- weird, uncomfortable, sterile, security camera laden environment with just a handful of counter seats.\n- weird display case full of \"stuff\" you can purchase at the store above the fried chicken place.  By \"stuff\" I mean weird random junk (like a bread shaped dish sponge or a plastic-masquerading-as-wood doorstop).\n\nWould I ever go here again?\nNever.  I don't eat food THIS greasy except for McDonalds breakfast.  It wasn't that bad, I just wasn't into it.  Cash only.
