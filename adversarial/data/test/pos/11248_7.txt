This is the Best Buy at Fiesta Mall. It is MUCH smaller than when the store was across the street in the former Border's shopping center a year or so ago. That means less space to store products and more \"just in time delivery\" (meaning they are out of many advertised items). \nAs noted by other reviewers, many of the employees are not knowledgeable about the products and services and irate customer exchanges are not unusual. For a long time Best Buy only offered Microsoft Windows computers, but now also offer MAC\/Apple and Android computers\/tablets. I am NOT a geek, but migrated to Linux a few years ago (when Microsoft went with the VISTA bow-wow operating system) and had to go to Target's to get my Linux ASUS netbook because Best Buy had nothing but netbooks with the buggy Microsoft operating system.\nNOW for this Christmas season's Best Buy BLUNDER: Thousands of Best Buy customers will not get their online electronics gifts in time for Christmas! Yep, it was on the Nightly Business Report last night. Best Buy's \"just in time delivery\" policy has resulted in them running out of many high demand products and many online orders will not be filled until after Christmas. Ho! Ho! Ho!
