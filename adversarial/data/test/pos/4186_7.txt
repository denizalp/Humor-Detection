By far the best place in town to get your hair cut! The staff are friendly and know tons about their craft. They have a great selection of product including Bumble & Bumble which my girlfriend loves. I came in to get my hair done and when I applied for the job I got the haircut for, I was hired that day! Thank you Hair Standard for helping my career!
