It's always nice to return to a Starbucks infrequently and still get great service and delicious coffee every time.\n\nThis Starbucks is located in Old Town Scottsdale, just a few blocks south of the Fashion Square at the corner of Scottsdale Ave and Indian School. Although not large with only six inside tables and about the same number outside, it does a brisk walk-in trade.\n\nThere is no drive through here and not many drive-through Starbucks close by. \n\nThe baristas are pleasant and efficient and my coffee has always been just right here. The clientele will vary from locals to tourists.\n\nStarbucks may be a chain, but you always get your coffee just as you want it and if it needs to be fixed, the baristas are always accommodating.
