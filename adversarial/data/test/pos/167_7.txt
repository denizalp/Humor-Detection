For all you shoppers out there this is your location for your needs, but there is a catch its an outside mall so only visit it during the 8 months of great weather. if you come out here from May - August it is just HELL!!! Run from store to store. \n\nYou can catch a flick, shop, eat, hit up walmart, bestbuy, sams club, within a mile you have every store that you could ever think about visiting. I would give this place 6 stars if I could.\n\nAlso they did close the food court itself, which is sad.
