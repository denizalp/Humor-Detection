I could have stayed at the previous bar to see how much I could drink as fast I can, but I heard you make irrational decisions when drinking whiskey. Hence going to Mulligan's.\n\nThursday nights are perfect if you don't want to wait 20 minutes for a drink, make friends with the bartenders and try to pick-up 5.658s.\n\nAlso, they have Happy Hour from 5-9..1\/2 off well drinks.... meh.
