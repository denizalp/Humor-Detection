What a great experience we just had... NOT! We ordered take out, and I sent my boyfriend in to pick it up while I waited in the car. On the takeout menu there is a coupon that simply says \"4 free egg rolls on orders over $50, must be mentioned at the time of order.\" I was looking at the menu online and don't have a printer at home, but I figured it would be fine since I mentioned it. Nowhere near on the coupon does it say you need to hand them a physical copy. \n\nSo my boyfriend goes in to get the food and the lady at the counter tries to charge him for the egg rolls since we don't have the coupon. He protests, and she makes several colourful references including calling him an ass, and referring to me as \"an idiot\" and \"the dumb girl on the phone.\" What wonderful service! Hope you guys have a lovely holiday season.
