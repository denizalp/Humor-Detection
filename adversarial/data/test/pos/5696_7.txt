- We were there Tuesday March 13th.\n \n     This bakery was just Okay, not so satisfying. My advise is keep on walking to the next one.\n\n     I will not come back that's for sure. I feel like because we had our backpacks on, we were treated less than the business people that were coming in. Like Hello?? Our money is just as worthy, so please show a little more attentiveness and care next time!! To other backpackers that is, because WE won't go back!! \n\n      Also the food was just okay it seems like they have more pastas and sandwiches than baked items, besides our turkey sandwiches lacked flavor or something. It could have been better overall, waste of time and money.
