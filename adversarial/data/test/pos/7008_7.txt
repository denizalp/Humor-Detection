I live in the neighborhood and this used to be an old paper store\/post office.\nThey did an excellent job with the interior and exterior decorating.\nI was excited to try it out after the long wait.\n\nStaff:\nThe waitress asked my date and I way to many personal questions. We were there for about 45-minutes and the she talked for at least 15-minutes about her dog and previous jobs.\n\nThe waitress and waiter started to fold napkins\/silverware one table away from us. Very impolite.\n\nFood:\nStarted with the steak. Came out extremely cold. I informed the waitress it was cold and she came back telling me they cooked it medium and apologized for cooking it like that. I was confused because I asked for it rare and she missed the main point that the food was served cold.\nAfter this I did not want to gamble on more cold food.\n\nCost:\n$35 for 3 drinks and 5 slices of steak.\n\nCompliment\/Response from employee:\n\nFirst let me tell you at that time that you came in my co worker and I had already put in a two week notice at this establishment number 2 the reason I was talking to you and your date is because I know her Nancy I worked together and you knew that she was talking to me as well so about the steak I told you it was served medium rare but I will have them fix it for you you know its people like you that go on this yelp because you're upset about your own personal life may be your date didn't go so well and try to hurt other people's jobs you should be ashamed and the reason we were doing roll ups because my co worker and I had to do a lot of work before we left with no help from nobody we were being abused and tormented by the manager but you didn't know that thank you very much you have a wonderful day I hope you feel very good about yourself\n\nResponse:\nAn employee who does not even want to work there was serving me. Explains a lot.\nI was perfectly content with the small talk but you kept dragging it out. My date worked with you for two days so there was not much to talk about or that you two have in common.\n\nUpset about my personal life? Date went bad?\nI now understand why you are not able to keep a steady job when you say things like this. My date and I still had a good time despite your poor service.\n\nWhy should I be ashamed for giving an honest review? If anything I was being nice. \nIt is obvious this is not the first time you have received feedback similar to this.\n\nAbused and tormented? Please get over yourself. It is a very simple job.
