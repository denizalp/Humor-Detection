Decor...all over the place.  Road signs, check.  VW camper van at the beach, check.  Guitars on the wall, check.  No thought at all...just full on \"Hey!  Let's be eclectic!!!\".  \nAs for the food, that's where stars start to really fall.  Again, \"Let's be eclectic!!!\", seems to be the motif.  I can hear the setting the menu... \"Ribs!  Ox tail! ...oh, and how about a pretzel!\".  \nTake a pass, or settle on a weak, small expensive truffle  pizza, then go find someplace for dinner.
