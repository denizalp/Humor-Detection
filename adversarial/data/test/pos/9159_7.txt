i love fried chicken, and i love COTW. It's a dirty, late night secret kinda place- like i want to order some chicken and eat it alone in the dark so I don't have to share, or be embarrassed that I ate like, half a chicken just now...\n\nIt is crispy, and always juicy inside (not greasy, juicy and moist!) The pieces are bigger than other chains- especially the breast which is actually a whole chicken breast. The seasoning, as far as I can tell, is just a lot of salt. I'm ok with that, because seriously the skin is so crispy and delicious... man I want some now...\n\nI like that the owner seems to hate his life, but still shows up to dunk endless birds into the  grease. I see they have opened up 2 other locations, and that makes me happy too. It's a family run place since it opened, which I also like to support.\n\nThe only downside is eating way too much and feeling like a salt mummy the next day, but worth it every time!
