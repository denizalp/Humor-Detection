Ok, so I guess the before and afters (Restaurant Impossible, that is) do this place a bit of justice, at least when it comes to the decor.  Otherwise, it seemed like it was the same food...not that I had a problem with the food to begin with.\n\nI was there for the Restaurant Impossible episode and ordered a whole slew of food.  Everything from lunch to breakfast.  When I say everything, I mean it.  See below for the list of ordered items:\n\nGrilled chicken spinach salad--onions, feta, tomato, and bacon vinaigrette dressing on the side \nCalifornia Omelet--egg whites, bacon, tomato, avocado with potatoes on the side\nSide of bacon\n\n*Gluten Free specialties*\nChicken Fried Steak with gravy\nRed Velvet Waffles (complete with pecans and cream cheese)\nRed Velvet Pancakes (complete with pecans and cream cheese)\n\nDid I say that this was for three people?  Lol.  Oh man, my boyfriend, Jude N, and friend Nicole B, had a field day.  Since I confirmed for three of us, we ate to our heart's delight.  Did I feel like a fat@#$$ afterwards?  Definitely.  However, it was worth it.  Almost everything was amazing.  The bacon was a bit singed, the steak and gravy a bit dry, and the GF Red Velvet waffles were also dry.  Otherwise, I thought that everything else was pretty tasty.  The salad was delicious (love a good salad), potatoes were pretty good, the omelet was so huge that I was thankful we were sharing.  Soooooo good.  We devoured the pancakes in less than five minutes.  I guess the fact that the decor was (as other Yelpers so eloquently put it) straight out of the 70s and the service was a bit slow, but otherwise, I enjoyed my meal.  Can't say the same for the rest of the patrons that were there for the taping.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend and I recently returned to see what had happened as a result of Restaurant Impossible coming in.  Glad to say that the decor is more hip\/trendy and not a sight for sore eyes.  They moved the hostess booth to the front vs. having it toward the back.  Also, it just feels more roomy in the restaurant\/cafe.  \n\nWe changed up our orders this time and opted for the Steak and Eggs, Gluten Free Red Velvet Pancakes w\/ pecans and cream cheese, Veggie omelet--egg whites, onion, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes--with a side of potatoes, as well as a side of bacon.  We almost ate all of it, except that I took home some potatoes and another order of pancakes (free with check in).  This time, zero complaints whatsoever.  They cooked the steak medium (per Jude's instructions) and it was pretty juicy\/tasty.  The bacon was definitely more on the crispy side, instead of being burnt.  They definitely made the omelet the way I wanted it, egg whites vs. regular eggs, and triple checked to see that we wanted the Gluten Free Red Velvet pancakes, which were phenomenal.  Zero complaints, for sure.  I liked that they were pretty attentive, chatty, and were more than willing to sub in gluten free pancakes for the regular ones, in case we chose to do so, since that's one of their new check in deals.\n\nAll in all, I'll be coming back.  The location is definitely what is killing them, since they're surrounded by so many other food choices in Chinatown.  But if you're wanting Gluten free deliciousness, I definitely would give this place a try.  Not only do they have some affordable prices, but their food is quite tasty.
