This is the best Indian buffet in Pittsburgh. The assortment of choices is unbelievable and it's impossible to try everything. My only small comment is that everything is richer than it has to be. I've had similar examples elsewhere that aren't as heavy. I also appreciate how balanced the heat level is on all of their dishes. There's a definite range. Tamarind, for example, is just hot.  Every dish is too hot. Not here. Another remarkable thing about their food is their use of fresh vegetables in many of their dishes. You rarely see such an abundant variety of freshly prepared vegetables.  Back off the fats a little and I would be here all the time.  There's too many cream and cheese based dishes with fried veg balls floating in them.
