See's is the best. It's nice they are not just in malls anymore but have stores in strip malls too. I went to the one on Lemon St in OC all the time when I was younger and was thankful I didn't have to go to the mall to get it. This location is in a shopping center and it always smells good when I walk in. Of course there is a cheery lady behind the counter ready to give me a sample of my choice. Sometimes I get a pound and sometimes I just stop in and pick out a few. Peanut butter cups and peanut brittle are my favorite and the different seasonal stuff is nice. Parking is right out front in the lot.
