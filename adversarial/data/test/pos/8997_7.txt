I love this place...  I purchased the $20 unlimited classes for the week..  I took:   \n\n-Beginner's Yoga with Becci on Sunday - Learning the poses and slow enough for a newbie to figure out what the heck is going on.\n\n-Slow Flow Yoga with Nicki on Tuesday - It was so awesome to destress at the end of the night.  Slept like a baby!\n\n-Vibrational Flow with Sandra on Wednesday - I am not too thrill or use to the gong, but I liked the instructions for all the poses.\n\n-Yoga Flow & Restorative with Jennifer on Saturday - Love our engery and vibe on a Saturday morning.\n\nGoing back for week #2!
