PERFECT DRIVE THRU for a date night if you want to spend quality time with someone you really enjoy. You will get to be trapped in an Indiana Jones maze-like drive thru for at least 25 minutes. \n\nIf you are in a hurry, or even just expecting a reasonable 7 min wait, this is not for you. In your rear view mirror you will enviously gaze upon more fortunate smoothie enthusiasts who are still able to back their cars out of this death trap. \n\nI wouldn't immediately blame the friendly staff who seem to acknowledge that there is a significant wait. It is probably process, procedures, and bad planning that drive this inefficiency. \n\nI can't tell if it would be less of a wait to walk in? There used to be a drive thru tropical smoothie location across the street that NEVER required this much of a wait. This has happened on three separate occasions. This one prompted a review because on top of the wait, my order was wrong (just a sandwich and two smoothies) :( I hope it gets better.
