Great place to shop if you like stuck up associates who couldn't care less. \n\nI am planning to return my Gucci purchase, the experience was so bad it ruined the product for me. After I explicitly told u it was a gift, why on earth would u put it in a torn gift box. WFT. Oh right, you don't give a shit about the customer. \n\nCan't wait until Nordstrom arrives, your ass will be so handed to you.
