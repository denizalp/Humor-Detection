I've been a patient of Dr. Branco's since I was 10 years old. 8 fillings and 4 wisdom teeth out later and I'm still coming back - and from the other side of the city!\n\nThe facilities are clean, the staff are super friendly (especially Jen the hygienist). It seriously feels like visiting old friends every time I'm there. They even took care of the kid while I was off being poked in the gums.\n\nOh - the only thing is that they don't really have all the bells and whistles that a lot of other dentists have like TV's in the room (*gasp* I have to TALK to my hygienist?!) and video games in the goggles, but Dr. Branco (and Dr. Gorgi) are kinda hot...so that's eye candy enough ;)
