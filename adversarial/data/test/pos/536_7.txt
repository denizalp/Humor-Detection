How is the rating so high? \n\nThe food is mediocre at best.  They didn't specialize in anything, and the multinational section all sucked pretty bad. They had Chinese selection, but what in the world is kungpao cauliflower? We don't have that dish. Also Korean rice noodles and BBQ ribs? Nasty.. Sushi? Machine made rice w\/ nasty farmed salmon with color additives.  \n\nSorry,  but ain't good when there's no line.  Also if it was that good,  you wouldn't need to give 2 for 1 advertisement on a United flight.
