I didn't stay here, but came for a sunday brunch with a friend's family whom were celebrating a couple birthdays in october.\n\nthe spread was as impressive as you would imagine from a resort of this caliber. one entire room (where you wait to be seated) was just for creme brulee, chocolates, cakes, etc.\n\ni have to say ambiance-wise, this place is absolutely gorgeous, but not my style. if your mom or grandma wants to do an uber fancy brunch or tea time (yes, they do a tea and scones deal) then this is your place. if you want a more post modern renovated hotel with tons of character, head for the valley ho or clarendon.\n\nback to the brunch. we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation, but there was big tray of mimosas set on the desk where they take your name. nice that you didn't have to wait for someone to come around with a fresh glass or wait for a refill, but i swear the host was giving me the stank eye for downing three in 15 minutes. ah well, just getting my money's worth.\n\nthe dining room is huge with horseshoe booths, tables and a piano player who did a stand up job (i;m not even mad that he doesn't take requests to play journey). the first room was all seafood....my plate was stacked high before i even made it to the salad table, the meat room or the fresh omelette or pancakes table. it was all delicious, i was smart to pace myself to be able to try everything. the clientele was as i mentioned above, but the buffet staff gets double points for making sincere, appreciative comments on our tables' tattoos (not a hint of creepy guy or 'i'm just repeating what i hear them say on Inked,\" nice work).\n\nyou could sit outside on the patio where there was a huge lawn for playing croquet (did you have brain tumor for breakfast?). it was really a delicious brunch, but if i'm spending that much money again i'm opting for a place that i feel more comfortable.
