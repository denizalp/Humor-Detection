UGH! had the worst experience trying to get our room at this hotel. i was checking in on a Sunday, around 2pm, trying to see if our room was available,  when the man (not quite) helping us told us rooms were ready, but we would have to pay a $40 early check in fee, or wait until 3 pm, to get our room sans fee.\n\nOk, I have never paid a fee to check in early- esp by an hour! at any hotel. this seems unheard of ,but fine,  we'll wait and hang out with some friends in the casino.  \n\nSo at around 3pm, we come back, see if we could get our room - and we are told no, rooms arent ready- theyll call us within 40 minutes for our room key. An hour goes by- no call. we go back to check in at 4 PM, and NOPE theyre still cleaning the room. \n\nIt wouldnt be so bad if we didnt see the crowds of other hotel guests being given key cards and directions to their room. but seriously? \n\nSo by 5 PM, we're pretty fed up. Our room was not ready. We need to get ready for dinner! It wouldnt have been so bad if the staff we dealt with were apologetic or even showed any sympathy for our situation \n\nWe finally were able to get our room by 5:30pm. We thought the worst part had been over, but as we walked in, the room was unlike the other rooms we had previously stayed in at Caesars. The bathroom had no door, the room seemed cramped, I'm pretty sure it was a wheelchair accessible handicap room- but not in a good way. It's almost as if they saved this sh*tty room for us. It was in stark contrast to Cosmopolitan where we'd stayed the night before. I almost wanted to go running back to Cosmo, where the staff have ALWAYS been accommodating.\n\n4 unsuccessful check in attempts, one sh*tty room later, i'm never ever staying here again. Zero stars..
