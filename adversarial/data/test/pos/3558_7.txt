I do not recommend this place at all!\n\nThe service was terrible. Dirty dishes left on the table, never refilled the tea cups, it took too long to deliver the food to the table, they serve sushi without wasabi and ginger, and they were out of eel.\n\nI started out with the seaweed salad. It was good. Then came the cold agedashi tofu, need I say more. My entree was the Luke warm seafood ramen. I am very disappointed with this place.\n\nThe other person with me had freezer burnt dried out sushi. What a waste of money.
