Me and boyfriend ordered the spring rolls for an appetizer... It was really small, half the size of one I would normally see... but the peanut sauce was really good. \n\nMy bf ordered the pho and he said it was just okay and pretty greasy compared to ones we've had before. I ordered the bun bo hue and it was really good and greasy but I didnt mind.\n\nThe waiter never re checked on us and we found him sleeping on the table in the back.
