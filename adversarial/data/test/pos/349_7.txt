I have been here quit a few times. Baseball games, Cactus bowl and concerts. I attended a party here and it was awesome. The venue was set up nicely for a Christmas party. They set up a stage for Flo Rida and a dance floor. Security check in went fast. The staff working was still nice. They worked hard to still keep the bathrooms clean and trash picked up. It's amazing how this venue can be a baseball stadium one day and turned in to concert\/ Christmas party the next day. I enjoy coming here and really like this stadium. I feel that there are plenty of food items to eat, lots of restrooms and plenty of security.
