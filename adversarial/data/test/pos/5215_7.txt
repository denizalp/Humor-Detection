What I don't like here is the service. There is a young girl who is almost always working. I have seen her try and pick fights with customers. She is very sarcastic, but it isn't nearly as funny as she thinks it is. Most of the other employees are helpful, but will never give me an answer as to why they don't have the macaroni side-dish. I have been coming here for 3 years and they never have it. Just take it off the damn menu! \n\nI've also arrived here before to be told \"we are out of chicken\" or \"we are out of biscuits\". They rarely have both flavours of their dipping sauce, and I am almost made to feel like an idiot when I ask for that damn macaroni and cheese... sorry.. keep going back to that. \n\nI can't blame the staff - its poor management or inventory control. But when you are called \"Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits\", people should show up being able to expect chicken and biscuits.
