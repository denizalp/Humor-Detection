Very helpful staff, ships packages all that great stuff.  But I'm pretty irritated by the 2 dollar rental fee to print something from a USB. Ridiculous. Can I bring my computer in to use your printer and avoid the fee? Will go to FedEx across the street from UH for these needs thanks to this asinine charge.
