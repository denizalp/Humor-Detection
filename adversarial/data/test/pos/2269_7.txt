Hey Tony!\n\nHey Michael!\n\nHey Tony, can I get some ICE CREAM?\n\nIf you know anything about Gastonia, you've probably heard of Tony's. It is an institution in Gastonia. It has survived floods, plagues, recessions and earthquakes, because when you make a solid, great tasting product, people will buy it no matter what. Okay, maybe I've exaggerated a little bit, but not about their ice cream. People travel miles for this stuff and fill coolers\/ice chests to take home. Now that's product loyalty.\n\nThe building is right off the main drag, old 74 with plenty of parking. Inside, the shop is pretty bare bones. There's always a steady flow of customers, but plenty of staff to help them. You may have to wait for a seat though.\n\nMy only gripe and it's a small one, is that I wish I could order a Root Beer Float or a Coke Float, Unfortunately, they do not carry Root Beer and they only have Pepsi products. Pepsi floats just aren't the same. Cheerwine Floats are popular but I'm a purist and less adventurous when it comes to ice cream. The milkshakes are my favorite product - enormous and delicious!\n\nThe portions are very generous and the staff are young, but friendly, patient and helpful. There's also a grill that does short order cooking. Dogs, Burgers, Fries, etc.
