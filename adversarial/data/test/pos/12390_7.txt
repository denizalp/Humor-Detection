I figured with an adjective like \"Mega\" in the title of your store, you'd have a huge selection...or maybe I'm just naive. In any event, they didn't have a huge selection of anything. What they do possess is a creepy guy who will follow you through the store insisting every item you look at is \"a great value, we can work something out.\" I mean, REEEALLY?! Annoying!\n\nMy boyfriend and I happened to wander into this location looking to compare prices to other stores and possibly buy something for our new house. Well, the prices were outrageous, but I guess that's standard for new furniture. However, a lot of the stuff looked cheaply made. We spent less than five minutes in this store simply because 1. it's not very big and 2. the creeper I mentioned was following us with his eyes the entire time from the middle of the store and chanting at us about the bargains and great value of everything. This was even after we told him we were fine and just looking around. \n\nI personally don't like to be bothered when I'm shopping, especially for a big ticket (for me) item. If I need help, I'll find you. He couldn't take a hint and when he wasn't looking, we dashed out of there. \n\nI doubt they'll stay open much longer. When I went to the Party City last week which is next door, they were having a liquidation of sorts sale.
