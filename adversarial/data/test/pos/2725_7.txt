I found Terri's on the web this morning and called the phone number for this Mesa location to check to see what the hours of operation are. The recording stated that they opened at 9am. I drove the 10 miles from my home in Tempe out to Greenfield Rd in Mesa and arrived at 9:10am to find out they don't actually open until 10am. Soooo, I had to drive the 10 miles back home. I had planned to buy a couple of end tables and see about consigning 2 leather chairs and ottomans.  \nSo, my new plan is try the new Andrews Furniture New and Consignment store in Tempe at Southern and McClintock.
