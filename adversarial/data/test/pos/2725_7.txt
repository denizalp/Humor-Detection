I have had issues with the service dept here before. I decided that I would give there quick lube dept a try today due to time constraints in my schedule. I must say that they did get my vehicular in and serviced per my request in a timely fashion and at a cheaper price than I was just quoted at another shop that did not have the needed oil to service my rear differential. So I will say on this trip there quick lube team did exceed my expectations.
