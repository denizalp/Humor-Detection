I've been to Georgetown for happy hour and for dinner on the weekend. I have to say I highly recommend coming here for happy hour because they have great deals on drinks and apps - including pizzas! I enjoyed their $5 glass of wine and the lobster pizza. It was really good! I wish I could give a higher rating but after coming here for dinner I left disappointed. The service is really good, it's just that the food wasn't that great. We had the lobster bisque which wasn't bad, but our entrees were so-so. I had the chicken wrapped prosciutto and the chicken was very greasy and tasted rubbery. They only served it with about 4 little baby potatoes. For $18 this is not worth it. \n\nHowever, I do enjoy the ambiance and the happy hour deals. I loved the lobster and manchego cheese pizza which you can split with someone. Overall, a 3 star experience in my opinion.
