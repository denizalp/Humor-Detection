I've watched Giada cook in her V-neck boob shirts on Food Network since Day 1. (So did all of my guy friends, but I don't think they were watching the cooking.) I was hoping for a great meal, but this place is one of the most disappointing ones I've had on the strip.\n\nWe weren't very hungry, so we kept the food small. We both had a different cocktail, both of which were tasty and strong. Standard Vegas-priced for $15 each. \n\nArtichoke soup for $12. The soup was lukewarm and had a mealy- not creamy- consistency to it. Neither of us finished the soup. I felt disappointed.\n\nI got the Tricolore salad ($17), which I didn't finish. Sounded delicious with pancetta, dates, kale, and a mess of other things... it just didn't taste good at all. I can't even put a finger on why it was not good, but this fatty did not finish this meal.\n\nMy friend got the spaghetti with prawns ($32, I think). That actually looked tasty, and I think other reviewers recommended it as well. \n\nAtmosphere is quite nice here with subtle lighting, and the restaurant is broken up into a cocktail lounge area, bar, and actual dining area. For some reason they had the windows open when it was 60 degrees outside at night, so it was incredibly cold in there.\n\nI'm sad to say this place is just overpriced and overrated hype.
