I was introduced to this place 3 weekends ago. I thought it was great and decided to try to come back about a week later. When I got there, the shop was closed with a \"sold out\" sign at the door. I was slightly annoyed that I had walked there, hungry, and wasn't able to get anything for lunch. I didn't know they could run out of food and close early! Then I realized it was 2:30PM. Not sure why I would ever think it's a good idea to go get lunch at 2:30PM, but that's when I was there. So I was left to only be annoyed at myself for getting there too late. \n\nThis week, I made it a goal to get to Seven Lives before 2:30PM. Heck, I would go at noon even! When I got here earlier this week for lunch, the place was packed. It made me appreciate why it's possible for them to be sold out. I placed an order for a blacked mahi-mahi taco and a fish taco. I was told that it would take about 15 minutes. So I went outside and walked a little bit to grab a can of guarana to have with my tacos. By the time I got back, it was perfect timing, as my order was ready (it was slightly sooner than 15 minutes). I added hot sauce to it, and lunch was on!\n\nAt $5 a taco, the lunch was $10. I think that's a nice price point (for tacos in Toronto).\n\nSo how was the food? The mahi-mahi was good. I'd have it again, sure. But the fish taco was amazing! The fish was battered and then fried. The batter was not soggy and not overly crispy...just right. The fish was soft and tender. Without a doubt this is my favorite place for tacos in Toronto. It's maybe even my favorite place in N. America, outside of California. People ask me if I can really say I like it better than Grand Electric. I can.
