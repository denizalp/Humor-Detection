new NEW fave FAVE --- think XS, Surrender\/Encore Beach CLub, Marquee IN ONE :):):)\n\nwhen I first heard they were re-doing\/renovating Drais, I thought - GROSS! \nI've never been a fan of the original (afterhours) Drais so, I just thought this would be as seedy as the original.\nBOY WAS I WRONG.\n\nWent to the opening night and it was plainly IN-SANE. Lines were non-existent, hosts seemed unprepared, and the hotel itself didn't know what was going on lol\n\nSo, I went a few days later during Memorial Day weekend, after the UFC fight I attended. Needless to say it was a sh*tsh*w all over the strip and at Cromwell valet but, thankfully a friend had a Drais cabana so, it was easier to get in.\n\nOnce we entered it was a beaut! As luxe as XS, with Encore Beach Club type cabanas and palm trees, and a WAY better view than the rooftop of Marquee. \nBEST OF THREE WORLDS!!!!!!!!!\n\nMusic is more my scene and not too much EDM so, something I like to dance to. They had fireworks on the rooftop right above us which was quite spectacular...or maybe, I was just drunk...idk lol\n\nOnly been to the nightclub but, I'd love to do dayclub. And because Victor Drai did this club amazingly, I'd like to check out afterhours, as well.\n\nThis is next level Vegas -- basically, 24 hour club! ONLY IN VEGAS, BABY =)
