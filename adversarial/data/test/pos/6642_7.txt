This place is super affordable ($35 for a pedicure and manicure) but you really get what you pay for.  I was there on a Saturday and had made an appointment but they kept taking walk-ins even though they didn't have enough staff to handle it.  So it ended up being a major rush job.  I've definitely had better, more thorough pedicures, and my manicure was essentially a quick hand massage and some polish (I could've done that myself).  I might give it another chance on a weekday to see if a less busy day results in a better pedi-mani.
