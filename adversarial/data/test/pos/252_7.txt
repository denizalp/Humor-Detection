Cali Sandwiches hits the spot like no other Italian sandwich I know of. I religiously order a medium veal w\/ onions and cheese and sauce on the side. Night last, in addition to ordering my sauce on the side, I found the best way to eat this now. I pour the tomato sauce on the sandwich but I don't flood it, and then as I eat I still dip it. This is the perfect way for me to eat it and it ensures I don't have tomato sauce rolling down to my elbows. \n\nI could eat here easily 3 times a week, and my record is 1 veal and half a chicken sandwich.
