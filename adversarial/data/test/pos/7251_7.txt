This Mothership is out of this world when it comes to caffeine and pastry.\n\nWe live on the other side of town, but stop here whenever we get a chance.\nThe latte is my go-to drink (still) which I normally get with almond or soy milk, but I make the sacrifice and have regular milk for latte art here (those other milks don't work well to make designs).  Dante is the master barista who's always friendly, informative, and an expert in latte art; I just like seeing a pretty heart or flower in my caffeine before I imbibe.  The pastries are made in-house and the selections are always tempting, especially the cinnamon rolls.\nMothership has cold brew as well as a hops version which is fabulous and refreshing, part beer and part coffee.  \nMothership is the mom of Sunrise Coffee down the street, so if you're a fan of that coffeehouse, you'll love Mothership.  If you've never been to either and you like caffeine made well, check these businesses out.
