Went there for the sake of seeing what it's like and how it compares to what is seen on TV. The show version looks bigger to me - and cleaner too. The \"live\" version had about 60 people inside with about 10 store staff behind the counters. Large crowd outside too - looked like they were waiting for a bus or something. Seeing some of the stuff that was on the show was interesting (like the small cannon). \n\nAbout 40% of the place is dedicated to retail items related to Pawn Stars. I'm not in the market for Chumlee notebooks or Rick mugs though. The Old Man was there in an office - could see him through an open window in a wall. A staff member says the others are in only occasionally. \n\nThe stuff there was overpriced. I saw a St Gauden's $20 gold piece in a plastic holder that was in really mediocre condition as that coin goes. Nothing special about the date either and it was priced at $1,800. I'd venture to say I could find a better coin of the same date for $150 - $200 less at a reputable coin store. Maybe Rick thinks he'll make money at that price - but only if a sucker buys it. \n\nGlad I saw it - no need to go back..
