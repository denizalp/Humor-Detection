First time here. In dire need of an oil change since shipping my car up here. Not to mention needing to do smog so I can get my car registered. This shop had mostly good reviews on Yelp so I figured I'd check it out.\n\nThe prices seem pretty reasonable. Smog for 9.99; oil change for 9.99. For synthetic, 49.99. One of the gals at the front desk said they'd also offer $10 off for a Yelp review.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, I was greeted which was nice since it's hard to come by decent customer service. The other gal seemed to be having a rough morning, she was very scattered and on edge, but friendly nonetheless. She kept quoting folks about a 20 minute wait which isn't bad.\n\nChecked in at 0930.\nIt's now 1030 and I've watched my car go untouched while other customers with similar services walk in and out. I've never waited this long for an oil change, even at the busiest service stations. \n\nAt this point I'm not sure there is any incentive to return and I'll probably look elsewhere for the next oil change.\n\nSince I'm still waiting and the service hasn't been completed yet, I'll update the review later.
