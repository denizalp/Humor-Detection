So far so good (at least for the most part) \n\nAt first our ordering was a little chaotic. The girl was very detailed and explained about each of the items and offered us a lot of samples so that we could try before choosing what to order. I'm glad they did because the turkey chili was delicious. I never would have really tried it otherwise but YUM! \n\nI ordered the Korean tacos. They come with four pretty small tacos but for around $10 it is a pretty good deal. I was surprised that the meat was served cold on the tacos but it was good. The tortilla chips could have been better and maybe serve with a little more salsa. *1 two ounce portion cup is not enough. \n\nThe bf ordered the turkey chili and a protein bowl filed with things he had sampled. I really liked the avocado salad & the veggies. We also ordered two juices and both were really good. I know the bf lined that his had cayenne in it. \n\nA few little quirks that probably still need to be worked out as with any new place but my biggest complaint would be temperature. It was absolutely freezing, only a little warmer than outside. I had to keep my heavy coat on the whole time and I noticed another customer also had hers on. The staff didn't seem to be cold in just their fitted t-shirts. The place has a lot of windows so I hope they are able to manage temperature better in the future. Regardless we'll def be back even though my bf doesn't love the places where you order before you sit. ;)
