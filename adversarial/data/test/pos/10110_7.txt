Thanks to Derek r.'s review, I thought I'd add my $.02.  \nIt's been awhile since I last dined here (at least a couple of years), as I try to support non-chain restaurants these days, but I enjoyed the few dining experiences here, solo and w\/ relatives.  Servers were always friendly and efficient.  Tables, chairs, booths, and women's restroom were clean.\nIf you're one to check out those mailers that arrive in your mailbox from time to time, you'll know that 5 & Diner usually has BOGO offers on there (buy one, get one).   \nYears ago ('03, '04?), this very location sold, during Christmas season, upcoming new year calendars that had cute 50's theme pics.  Each month's page offered coupons such as BOGO, free children's entree with paying adult, or a free shake w\/ an entree.  Does anyone know if this promotion is still running every Christmas season?
