As a person who generally doesn't care to get photographed, I've never cared about the Yelp event photos.  I think Paul's photo are fine and he's definitely a competent photographer.  However at the last Elite event, I did over hear two separate incidences in which he out right said no to taking someone's photo.  I don't want to be tattling out of school, but I had actually mentioned after the event how I thought that the incident was a bit strange, but again I didn't give it much thought thinking it might have been an isolated incident (as I didn't know about the Jen M \/ Chris P story until now).\n\nThe first time I thought I had probably misheard what was said and didn't think much about it.  But the second time left very little doubt with me and know the person rejected was left a little embarrassed  and taken aback.  I think this person was either a +1 or a newbie Elite whom I don't know, but hopefully they don't think this is typical of the photographers at these events.\n\nI don't know Paul and I'm hoping there's a reasonable explanation for it, as those who get photographed seem to like his work.  I'm hoping he'll clarify the situation and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt until then.
