I will keep this review short and sweet! The sparkle bar will do just that, make you sparkle! I came here prior to an event and I cannot get over how amazing and beautiful they made me feel inside and out. I had been in a bit of a beauty rut and I needed something to get me out of it and sparkle bar did just that!\n\nOnly a few criticisms and suggestions, carry a higher and more extensive variety of cosmetics and brands... I was surprised at how low end a few of the products were that were used and offered there.  Also, I wish they sold some of the products they used mostly lipgloss and lipstick!  \n\nBut that's just honestly nitpicking! So glad that a place like the sparkle bar is in Phoenix, it is a much needed service. Overall it was a truly positive experience and I will be back!
