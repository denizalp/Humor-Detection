Hope you don't want your sheets clean when you stay at the Delano!!\n\nMy wife and I checked into the hotel on Friday. We had just watched the 60 minutes show on how hotel staff don't change the sheets. We joked with the staff at check in at the Delano that it couldn't happen at this type of hotel. Oh, yes it can and did. \n\nOn Saturday morning we called to have our sheets changed while we were out shopping. My wife marked the sheets with a small amount of lipstick in order to make certain the sheets were changed. When we came back to the hotel in the early evening and checked our sheets. Our bed was made. We pulled back the sheets and there was the lipstick that my wife had put on the sheets before we left. THAT IS GROSS! In this day and age with bed bugs and god knows what else is lurking in hotel rooms, they don't even change your sheets when you ask.\n\nWe called down to the front desk and they said they would send someone right up. An hour later, no one had arrived. The front desk also said they were going to send up champagne and strawberries for the inconvenience. Did either of those items arrive? NO!!!! The front desk manager TK was useless and unhelpful when I spoke to him face to face. \n\nCustomer service at The Delano is dead. There are so many other places to stay in Vegas for $300.00 per night. Take your business to another location.
