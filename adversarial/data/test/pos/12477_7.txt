For the past two Vegas trips, we have had at least one night where we stopped at Hakkasan. We were treated awesomely both times.\n\nThe first time, I went with a group of girls on a Thursday. We arrived early with little to no line. There were free drink tickets for vodka drinks. I don't remember what DJ was there that night, no one spectacular.\n\nWe stayed out late and danced our butts off. We met new people and had a great time. \n\nHakkasan always has the top DJs and is built beautifully. There are always awesome go go dancers and light shows up front. And the dance floor is big, but never big enough.\n\nThe second trip we made, we came only because Rose Rabbit Lie closed at 3 am, but we knew Hakkasan would still be open. We didn't get there until about 3:15\/3:30. They were hesitant to let us in, but because we were girls, they did. \n\nObviously the DJ had left by then. I don't remember who it was but it was Saturday night so it was someone good. \n\nWhen we got to the dance floor there was cotton everywhere! What the hell?! A pillow fight happened I think! Crazy! Anyway, we ordered drink and proceeded to keep dancing until 4 am when they sent everyone away.\n\nIt was a great time. Hakkasan has never done me bad. And their DJ lineup cannot be beat by any other Vegas club.
