I'm writing this review with an open box of cookies from Monsieur Felix and Mr Norton that we received as a gift from someone. These are probably the best cookies that I've ever had. They're not the enormous cookies that you get at restaurants to compensate for the high price. These are the size that you'd expect from homemade cookies. One bite into these cookies and you can tell that their secret ingredients are butter and sugar. These are some of the most richest cookies I've ever tasted. My favorites so far are:\n\n- Orange Chocolate\n- Macadamia
