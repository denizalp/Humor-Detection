I am extremely pleased with cuatomistic! I had an idea for a custom made shirt awhile ago and just needed to find somewhere reliable to make them. I checked reviews and I really liked the reviews for customistic. I had a question about printing on a dogs shirt so I emailed them via Yelp and got an answer shortly after. I came into the shop and received excellent service in helping me design the shirts and obtain the final product I was looking for. I was making the shirts as a Father's Day surprise from our puppy so I had no rush in getting them back. I dropped them off Monday and picked them up Friday and was extremely happy with the outcome! Thank you so much for helping me with this surprise! The shirts turned out exactly as I imagined, if not better!  Excellent customer service and excellent quality. I will be using them again:)
