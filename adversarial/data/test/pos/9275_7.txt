Awesome selection of fruits and vegetables, packaged goods, and fresh meats. The store also has a food court with various plates and family meals, and a juice bar with freshly made juice and aguas frescas. The different types of chicharron were tempting! There are quite a few meats and vegetables you won't find at your average grocery store and everything looked very fresh and well organized. Some other notable goods I saw on browsing were fresh Mexican style cheeses, ceviche, store made tortillas, packaged salsas, and a great selection of seafood.
