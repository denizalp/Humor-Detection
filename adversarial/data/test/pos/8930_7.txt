You know... You come back to Charlotte, having been gone for ten years and, supposedly the food has gotten a lot better during that time, like it has around the country. So you look for some of the top new restaurants, and find Roosters, and Yelp gives it four stars with some glowing reviews and you're like... All right! It's 9:15, everything closes in 45 minutes, I'm in South Park, and wouldn't mind a nice sit down meal... LETS GO TO ROOSTERS!!\n\nSiggggggghhhh. Ugh. Charlotte... So disappoint. \n\nI dunno. Maybe they were having an off night. I mean it IS Tuesday night. Perhaps expectations were wrong. The place itself, it's gorgeous. Really dug the look of it, the laid back, classy atmosphere, the wall of cock. But maaaaan. That food was OFF. \n\nWe ordered the chicken liver mousse, which was covered with a rock hard layer of schmaltz that we had to drill through. I dunno what they put in there, but the seasoning was just off. Maybe sherry? \n\nThen the main dishes. The bbq pork shoulder. I don't understand. Why did you cube the pork like that? What was the point? And the slaw. It was warm. Warm slaw isn't a good thing. In fact it's a bad thing. A harbinger of pain to come, of frequent dates with the john and childhood summers filled with church bbqs, and Cole slaw left out too long in the sun. The fries were good though, a lot like the fries you get at Five Guys. \n\nWe also ordered a couple of sides. The spinach was whatever. The Mac and Cheese? Have you all not had Mac and Cheese before?? The succotash was good, corn was sweet, well seasoned. Beans were a bit mushy, but maybe that's how they like it in Charlotte. And the fried chicken of the woods. I ate about five pieces before realizing that it wasn't actually chicken. Maybe cause I figured it was dry and tasteless and that's just how it was cause the rest of the meal didn't have much flavor either and that was probably the problem. \n\nTHE SEASONING WAS ALL OFF. \n\nLike it wasn't consistent. \n\nMac and cheese? BLAND\nWilted spinach? BLAND (did you all use unsalted butter to wilt the spinach??)\nFried chicken of the woods. Bland and blah. Even the ranch needed salt. \n\nThe pork was actually well seasoned. And the succotash slightly over seasoned, little heavy on the salt. \n\nBut seriously. Maybe the cooks were all in. Rush to get home and they forgot to salt everything. But you go to a nice restaurant, spend $90 for two people, you expect a little consistency between dishes. It shouldn't taste like we ordered from five different restaurants. \n\nBut like I said, maybe an off night. If not, God bless em and God bless Charlotte because three stars is being generous. Seriously. Top 30 restaurants in Charlotte? Y'all out of your damn minds.
