I was threatened by hotel staff... \n\nI have ever been treated like this by a hospitality establishment. The management at Treasure Island is absolutely despicable. I was told I would be kicked out of the hotel if I publicly expressed my disgust with this hotel... But it's check out time, so here is a big middle finger to you Treasure Island.\n\nYou have a guest that is separated from his group, without a cell phone, room key in the room ... Trifecta of bad luck. I actually had prescription medication in the room with my name on it that would prove that I was a guest in that room.\n\nFront desk was extremely rude and told me that I would be removed from the hotel unless I purchased another room.  I was told that they would refund the charge once my friends showed back up ... Guess what? I'm now fighting the charge with my credit card company.\n\n\nI've stayed at some great places in Vegas where they treat you with respect. This is hands down the most disgusting experience I have ever had.\n\nStay somewhere else ... There are much better options I the area.
