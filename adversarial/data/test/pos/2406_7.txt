I was in Vegas for a motorcycle auction last weekend and as luck would have it one of my good friends was there at the same time.   Her days are not filled as much as her nights so she joined me at Bally's for the auction and we decided to go off and get some lunch.   It had to be close (didn't want to miss too much of the auction action) and it had to be fun.  Giada's fit the bill perfectly.\n\nWe were both very impressed as we walked into the place, it was absolutely beautiful.  The hostess seated us at their best window table overlooking the strip and Caesar's Palace.   As I was treating I was thrilled to see that the prices were more than reasonable for lunch.   You can actually have lunch in this amazing place for under $20 per person.  Of course we didn't but still it was much less than I would have expected.   \n\nI had a Bloody Mary and my friend had a Prosecco to start us off and for our lunches she had the Sardinian Gnocchi al Pomodoro ($16) which the waiter explained to us is not your traditional Gnocchi but one that is more of a pasta than a potato flavor...he was right and it was still delicious.   I decided to enjoy a pizza, the Salumi Piccante spicy dry sausage, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, oregano (also $16).  Delicious and generous... a table of four could share one as a hearty appetizer. \n\nOur server was exceptional, nice and very helpful in steering us to other places that we should try during our respective Las Vegas vacations!   My friend thought the hostesses' dresses were adorable.
