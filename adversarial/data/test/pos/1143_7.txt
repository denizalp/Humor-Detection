$800 damage to my dashboard that the installers did to my car. Yes - I am in your database mr. Owner. I spoke with you on the phone. Made a claim to my insurance. Later to find out that the molding came off the side windshield AND a piece of molding is missing in the t-tops that was never re-attached. I had multiple vehicles seen by this company. The claim was not on a minivan (obviously since minivans don't have t-tops).\n\nI had a VERY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE with this company. I will never return to this place.
