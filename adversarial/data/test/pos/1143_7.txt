I trust no one else with my cars.\n\nAn a-hole rear ended me one morning about three weeks ago at 7am. I'm not happy. 14K miles on my car and spotless, well not anymore!!! Minor damage, I'm talking a few scratches to the naked eye. But hello, it's not a cheap car and the damage he caused added up to over $1200! \n\nWell to make a long story short I have to get several estimates as normal but of course I know I'm only letting it get fixed here at ExotiCars. The other places I went were a total joke.\n\nVictor took care of me. He is a very nice guy. Excellent professional service. I had a check already from the a-hole guys insurance. Insurance adjuster agent forgot an OEM factory upgrade part off the estimate...but Victor worked with the claims adjuster and the adjuster sent him the $$$ difference directly! Hassle free! \n\nThe two ladies at the front desk are super sweet. When I call to ask Victor a question I was promptly transferred back to his desk office phone. Very nice service also when closing out the \"transaction\" today.\n\nMy car looks brand new just like it was before. When I picked up my car today it was spotless clean inside and out. No issues. \n\nDon't settle for some pain in the ass run around...when taking your car for unfortunate repairs. Lord knows it's enough stress to deal with in the first place!!!!!
