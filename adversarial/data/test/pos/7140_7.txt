I attended my first event on Saturday evening, 7 August 2016.  It was the Barbra Streisand concert.  I, like some others, was concerned about parking.  I had several thoughts in mind, but in the end, I used ParkMobile to buy a spot and I chose the Aria event garage.  Everything went smoothly.\n\nI bought my ticket online and printed it out so there was no problem with admission to the event.  The lines were long for the scanners but they moved along and before long I was inside the arena with my ticket scanned by a pleasant young woman who told me the way to go for my seats.\n\nI was not going to spend the multi-hundreds of dollars for the better seats and I abhor floor seats.  They're flat and you just can't see over people in front of you.  I opted for an upper level--the highest upper level.  I got a seat in Row B about in the middle.  I knew when I chose the seat that I'd be closer to the stage than at the horseshoe end of the arena and the seat was just fine albeit Streisand was a mere little thing on the stage below.  I left my binoculars in the car but the big screen is good enough if you want to see a performer larger than they appear from where you're sitting.\n\nAt the end of the concert, I started to wait for the people to leave the upper rows so I could get out, too.  I then got the idea of hopping over the Row A seats which I did and I went along the row to the end of that area and walked directly to that level's plaza.  The line for the escalators was large so I walked down the stairs instead ending outside across from the center of the Aria Event garage parking.  I walked toward the front of the arena and somewhat jaywalked to get across before the Metro officer started allowing traffic to move along the street.\n\nThe line for the elevators was long at the garage so I walked up the five floors to where my reserved parking was.  A double days worth of gym workout yesterday.  All traffic leaving the garage must turn right and exit north along Frank Sinatra Drive which is exactly the way I wanted to go.  From the end of the concert to my house was 30 minutes.  Not bad at all.\n\nAll the staff I came into contact with at the garage or at the arena were very helpful and friendly.  Now that I've been here once, I know thew easy way for me in and out.  You could park at the regular Aria garage and walk over, but I found the paid parking was easier and worth the extra price unless I was staying after an event for some reason.\n\nI'm very pleased with our new arena.  Las Vegas should be proud!
