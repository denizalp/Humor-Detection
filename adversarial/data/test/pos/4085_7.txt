I went to this HUGE Goodwill on Grand Avenue this weekend.  It was raining all day and I was bored.  Since one of my favorite things to do, on the cheap, is to rummage though the second hand stores for interesting items and other cool buys, we dressed the baby, packed the diaper bag, and off we went to check out some crap that used to be owned by other people!!\n\nFirstly let me say that this is like Goodwillzilla.  It's huge!  I heard it used to be a former Kmart location so that makes sense for the size of the building.  \n\nSadly though, it's not exactly bursting at the seams with quality stuff.  This one is pretty well picked over and I saw very, very little that interested me.  Although I did find a nice (almost new) baby doll for my baby girl, and black skirt for myself.  \n\nI will also mention that I did accidentally go on a '50% off everything' weekend and that alone may have made it seem more picked over than normal...I'm not sure but the place seemed pretty cleaned out and the remaining stuff was more junky than used.  The employees I encountered were all friendly enough.  \n\nI will also mention that this Goodwill had an bigger than normal selection of clothes so, by logical deduction, it probably would be a pretty good stop to make on a dirt cheap clothing rummage day.
