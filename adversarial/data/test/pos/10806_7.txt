FIRST OFF, no parking for UFO'S. Made me mad since I did come from the 3rd moon of Jupiter. SECOND OFF, No Guy from the show. Think he would stay there if he loved it so much. Enough bad comedy now on to the review.  Like a lot that post here the service is bad, no really bad. The staff just doesn't care. Waited 15 minutes for someone to finally come to our table and there were only 5 customers in the place. We did like the microwave garlic knots but they would be so much better made fresh. The water tasted weird so we waited 10 minutes for our waitress to come back and take our order and we asked for new water. She took another 10 minutes to bring us water and as she sat them down we could clearly see both glasses were dirty. Before she ran off we asked for the manage\/owner. This guy came over and acted like we were bothering him because we wanted clean glasses. He called our server over and told her to bring clean gasses this time. How many times does she bring dirty glasses ?\n\nNow our order. We ordered the two dinner salads and a white pizza. Our server bought to our table a calzone and what looked like chicken parm ? We said that wasn't our order and she huffed and then removed the order but as she did the chicken parm fell off the plate and on to the floor. She then acted like it was our fault. She YELLED for some guy to come pick up the mess and left us but not before she took the calzone to another table. \n\nA this point we got up and went to the register as we had had enough. About 45 minutes for some dirty water and microwaved knots ? We told the person at the counter we were leaving and the person just said okay.\n\nAs we got into our car (UFO) we saw our server putting our salads on our now empty table and looked around for us. She just left the salads there and went back to behind the counter. We laughed a bit and wondered why such bad service.\n\nThere are MUCH better places then this with a nice friendly staff. Also microwaved knots are not a good way to start a meal even if they are free. Guess Guy F lies on his show as this place could not be the one he was at unless they hired real staffers for that day.\n\nNEVER AGAIN, heck Olive Garden is better.
