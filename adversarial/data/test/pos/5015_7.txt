This place tries to look like a strip club.  I don't know what the appeal is.  From the stripper pole, to the slutty girls and the loud music.  Our group had to go on the patio and escape.  There were found refuge.  It was quiet and you could actually carry on a conversation.\n\nWith many other bars to choose from in the area, I'd go somewhere else.  There's nothing special about this place.
