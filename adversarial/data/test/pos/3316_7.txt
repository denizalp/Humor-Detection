Booked a hotel from travelocity because the corner room was not available on their website anymore. We got our corner room but 3rd floor and seems a little bit smaller than what we expected. I guess you really get what you pay for, overall the stay was amazing! All staff were very helpful, room service food was to die for! Next stay I definitely want to stay at sky suite, I can't wait! Not the best hotel I've stayed at but one of my fave!
