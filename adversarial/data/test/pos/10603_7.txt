In case you're slow like me, It is pronounced \"crossover.\" Now, you're in the know! We popped in last night, and I was expecting to see a bunch of sneakers I couldn't afford and a cooler than me sales associate. I was WRONG wrong WrOng! Pretty much every sneaker\/show I adored was under $60. Granted, they don't have a boat load of girls' shoes, but I eyed a lovely orange pair of Nikes and a loafer that looks like a Croq, but isnt. I tried that one on, but my husband immediately told me I looked like a boy. Shucks. \n\nThe sales associate was a chill guy, and I felt totally comfortable browsing about. They had some super soft scarves, mittens and hats for under $30, and a good selection of clothing by The Hundreds, Krew, the new Nike Manny Pacquiao line... okay I don't know a lot about these brands, but if you're into street smart wear, they've got something to keep you lookin' legit. Plus, they're known to drop some tunes. Hey, it's partially owned by DJ Vice, so they've got to keep the music real!
