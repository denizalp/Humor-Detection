What do you do after a four mile hike?  Try a new place for lunch with your hiking mates.  This is what landed us at Bob Taylor's Ranch House late this morning.\n\nTwo of us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I'd make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.\n\nFor dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it's huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.\n\nService was terrific--perhaps because we were the only people in the restaurant.  I have a feeling that our server would have been almost as attentive if there had been 5 tables occupied.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.\n\nAfter all the years of seeing the signs for this place or seeing ads, I'm glad we gave it a try.  I have a feeling that when we hike Mount Charleston and add lunch to our rigors, we'll stop here again!
