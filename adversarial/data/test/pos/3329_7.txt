This Tim Horton's sucked. For one, they got my breakfast order wrong, and it wasn't even crowded. Second, they didn't care to fix it. Third, there was no soap in the bathroom. Fourth, their WiFi was slow or kept kicking me off. Fifth, their coffee was burnt. And sixth, they don't have almond milk. WTF. Should've gone next door to Starbucks.
