We missed out on the family dinner (traffic in LV is terrible) so I ended up taking my two nephews to dinner at the hotel. I made them pick the restaurant and of course they picked Johnny Rockets. E me. Lol\n\nIt's a fast casual joint in Bally's food court. Go to the counter, place your order, pay and wait for the beeper to beep. Pick up your food and seat yourself. \n\nI got the The Original w\/ Fried Egg. It's a good burger, very juicy. The fried egg was well, fried. Fried to death. lol. No yolk to add more creaminess. Skip the fried egg IMO. \n\nSmoke House w\/ Mushroom. This is The Original with bacon and cheese. My nephew added mushroom to his burger. He liked it. \n\nThe Rocket is an Original with cheese. A cheeseburger in other words. My nephew inhaled this burger. Lol. \n\nFries were okay. But at almost $5 an order, you don't get much for your money. \n\nFor drinks, two of us got the root beer float. It was really good. My other nephew got the strawberry & banana shake, he liked it. \n\nPrice was on the high side. Dinner was over $70 for burger, shake & fries for 3. Yikes. \n\nIt was a good dinner and I got to catch up with my two young nephews.  But I should have just taken them to McDonalds instead. I think they would have enjoyed it there as much as here and it would have been considerably cheaper, lmao!!
