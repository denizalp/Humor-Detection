After the baseball game, we walked over here for some grub.  I have had the place bookmarked for awhile, but I'm never down this way.  Until tonight......\n\nWe walked in and there was no hostess.  We stood there for a minute and it seemed like a \"seat yourself\" type of place.  We walked to the back room, sat down at a table, and then sat..and waited...and waited.  Probably after close to 10 minutes, a waiter came by and asked if we had been helped.  We told him no, and then he started to help us.  To his credit, he did apologize about the mix up and from his apology, we probably should have had someone seat us so that the waiter\/waitress in that section, knows that someone new has arrived.  Anyways....looked over the menu and decided to go with the pork belly tacos, and an order of nachos to split.  My buddy went with some deviled eggs and the brisket tacos.  Here is how they were........\n\nNachos-  These things were pretty damn delicious!  They serve these to you in a small cookie sheet.  They are topped with a GRIP of brisket, cheddar cheese, chipotle cheddar sauce, avocado relish, jalapenos and cilantro.  The chips were crispy, the cheese nicely melted, the brisket was moist and super plentiful...good smoke flavor...the chipotle cheddar sauce wasn't that great.  It kind of hardened up and congealed a bit.  It didn't ruin the nachos, but they may have been better without that cheese sauce.  I would get these again.  It was a huge serving!  Perfect for sharing, or just getting one as your meal!\n\nPork Belly Tacos-  These things were TINY! 3 street taco sized tacos.  They were topped with pickled onions and some avocado.  Um...they were just ok.  The pork belly tasted alright, but it was a little bit softer than other pork bellies I have had.  Each taco was 2 bites.  I don't think I would get them again.  Happy hour, maybe.  Full price ($12.00), probably not.  \n\nBrisket Tacos-  Me and my buddy did a taco trade.  I had one of his brisket tacos and gave him one of my pork belly ones.  The brisket taco was meh.  The brisket was incredibly dry!  The brisket on the nachos was nice and moist, but the tacos were dry as can be.  Not impressed at all.  Definitely wouldn't order again.\n\nDeviled Eggs-  $6.00 for 1.5 eggs.  They serve you 3 halves.  My buddy was joking, \"Where the hell is my other half of the egg?\".  At least serve 4 pieces for $6.00.  He said they were good, but he also said, \"You can't really fuck up a deviled egg...and when are deviled eggs not good?\".  True!\n\nService was good after the initial mishap.  Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  She did make one weird move though.  We had another buddy meet us there near the end of our meal.  He ordered a certain type of beer.  She returned with a different type of beer.  Turns out they were out of the one he ordered, but she brought him the \"closest thing to it\".  I have never seen someone bring out a totally different drink than the one ordered..at least without checking first or asking if it was ok.  That's like running out of Mountain Dew and bringing a Sprite in its place.  Sure, they are both sodas, but they are also nothing like each other.  He drank it, and said it was ok, but he was puzzled on how a server could pull something like that.  Anyways................\n\nFood was decent but a little bit expensive for the portion size.  Not sure if I would come back on my own, but if someone wanted to go here, I might give them another shot.  We were there really late too (9:30pm), and they stop serving food at 10pm.  Maybe we didn't get the best of what Bootleggers has to offer?  Maybe I will find out next time?  Maybe I won't?  Barely 3 stars.
