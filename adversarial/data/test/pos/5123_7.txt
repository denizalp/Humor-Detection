This was the second time I'd gone to this store. The first time when I was around 10. So today is the last time I will step foot in this place. I thought I would waste a bit of time and do some pre shopping before I head to the mall. My mom hyped the store up and promised that they'd carried those \"cute classic dresses\" that I'd liked.\n\nNo! This was apocalyptic.  Some sort of,lets stock up on the season before last seasons Michael Kors pumps before the world explodes mess. They even have yellow tape and a security guard standing guard in the aisle, while the chics restock the shoes.\n\nThis place is a zoo...my lack of patience and this foolishness just doesn't mix.
