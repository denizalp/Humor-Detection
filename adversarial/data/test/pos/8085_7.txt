Royal India Bistro is located inside the Rio Hotel & Casino. It was formerly known as The Gaylord. This Indian restaurant sports a world class ambiance however has average service and average food quality. The food is priced at the right levels commensurate with the quality. \nPapadum - This opening starter generally goes unnoticed however these were served mostly soft rather than on the crispy side and that got my attention. It was a disappointment. \nBombay Chicken Wings - Tasted hints of authenticity however most of the pieces were tough to chew rather than soft & succulent. Another disappointment. \nChicken Tikka Masala - This dish was the highlight of the dinner. It had the full\nFlavor and the spices released an aroma of authenticity. I felt that the sauce\/curry was on the runny side and should have been more creamy than what was presented. Better than average overall. \nChicken Tandoori - Expected a better presentation than the standard - throw buffet quality chicken Tandoori pieces on a bed of onions -  type of thing. Average taste. \nSummary - Food consistently failed to match the ambiance. Pricing was acceptable. Service was average.
