I just had the $13.99 plus $1.35 for canned mushrooms French dip. Really, a $15.00 French dip that is so pueney?? Besides being small, it was way too salty!! The mushrooms tasted like they just came right out of the can! I've had waaaaay better AND bigger French dips for $10.00. Not going back because I feel ripped off.
