this place has fucked up my order 3 out of the last 3 times i have been here, but at least they also make me wait for 20 minutes to have my food served to me. i've been the only car in the drive thru and it still took 20 minutes to make a burger and a kid's nuggets, so they have just as little urgency for drive thru customers as they do for people that eat in the store. \n\nin conclusion, i hope the proprietors of this establishment suffer from an acute case of some sort of necrotic viral infection.
