I've been getting my eyebrows threaded for 12 years now. So when I decided to move to St. Louis, I knew that I had to find someone that knew how to thread eyebrows. My co-workers suggested heading to the mall to get them done. After having had a bad experience and two differently shaped eyebrows. I did some research and came across Virun. She does an amazing job. She takes her time and is always able to schedule me in on late notice. When it comes to threading you really need someone who knows what their doing.
