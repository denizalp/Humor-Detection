I have to give this awesome Hawaiian grill a 5 stars! They have ultimately the BEST poke I've had in Vegas and the way they prepare the plate reminds me of Hawaii. If you're from Hawaii, you definitely wanna try this place out!\nTo also add their price point is ON POINT. \nYou get the best bang for your buck and they give you SOO MUCH food. They have a whole sauce station to get all your desired sauces. They have some Hawaiian juices if you wanted some lilikoi drink or whatnot.\nThe atmosphere is super nice in there too, if you don't want to sit inside there's outdoor seats too! \nMy favorite plate to order here HAS to be the kalua pork, so Ono, literally the BEST kalua and they offer you brown or white rice.\nThey also offer you salads if you're more of the vegetarian side. What's even more awesome is they offer kimchi slaw as a side too!!! Like whaaaaaaattttt  \nYou can also order the poke on the side, half lb or full lb to take home. \nIf I could Id eat here every meal the pricing is so good, the service is good, the sauces are good, the cleanliness is good. 5 stars!!!! \nI'll definitely recommend (well I've already did lol) and I'll definitely come back
