As everyone in Madison knows, there are no doughnut chain stores around.  No Krispy Kreme.  No Dunkin Donuts.  Although I know that the best doughnuts in town are from the Greenbush Bakery, sometimes it's just easier to go with the place down the street.  \n\nThat basically sums up the People's Bakery.  When you're too lazy to go anywhere else, they are pretty good.
