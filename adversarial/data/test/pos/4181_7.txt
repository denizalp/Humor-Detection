Okay, come on. It's 18 and over, yes it's going to be lame and cheesy, but hey, we don't go there because its classy and upscale. \n\nIt's a simple club. Dance floor in the middle, bar in the back, upstairs exclusively for the 21 and over crowd, and a couple of seating area's to the side. \n\nYeah, the crowd is a little \"ghetto\". Got a lot of skanks and wanna-be pimps, but hey, they're everywhere. The music is mostly the \"mainstream\" radio stuff that you'll find on 101.5, because they play the same music on that station that they play in the club on Friday nights. I can't complain too much about it. Gotta please the public, and right now, that's what's pleasing the majority of the public. \n\nThis place is fun, as long as you bring your own people. If you're going there to look for a hottie, you're bound to be disappointed. (Unless you like ghetto =] )
