Yes I am a fan of Davidson. \n\nGreat College Town, the Home of Davidson College. Liberal and Conservative at the same time but for a change, generally tolerant to all views.\n\nThe Town works hard to maintain it's identity and unique small time feel. Up until a couple of years ago, there was not even a large scale Grocery Store in Town. Those wanting to maintain the small town or village feel were opposed to it because it made the town more commercial and less human.  The Conservative element did not want the Grocery Stores because they sold Alcohol.\n\nFinally a Harris Teeter came in which is now part of Kroger. A rapprochement has been reached with the downtown left intact and new development east and west of Downtown.\n\nSo much for the discussion of the dynamics of the Community, Very dynamic with a lot to offer, particular in Downtown. Host of one of the best regional Farmers Markets on Saturday. A string of great restaurants, some outstanding and several good but need to push it to the next level.\n\nA lot to do. Very walking and bike friendly. Many great Churches all of which are very progressive and promote a doctrine of service and inclusiveness . \n\nGood place to park your car and go for a walk and enjoy all of the shops. Stop into Summit for great Coffee and the Soda Shop for what else,\n\nTake more than a couple of hours, unwind and enjjoy
