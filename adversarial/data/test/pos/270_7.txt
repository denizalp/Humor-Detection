The smoothie could have been mixed a little bit better, unless you like sucking banana pieces up your straw. \n\nTeenage girls behind the counter were perky. Although I was the only patron in the store at the time, they asked my name when I placed my order. Odd, I thought, but cool. \n\nVery clean place with limited seating. Music was loud, though. Guess the teens were jammin' with Jamba.
