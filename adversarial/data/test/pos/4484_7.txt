Writing a review for this place upsets me because I have to relive the terrible dining experience I had here a while back.\n\nNothing was glaringly bad about this place in general, but the lack of integrity that the general service upheld really bothered me.\n\nWe had dinner reservations for Friday night for a group of a 8 people. We were on time and seated in a timely matter. What upset me was the rash and hurried service displayed by our waiter. He was in no way attentive to our requests, and more so, I felt like he was trying to up sell us in every aspect of our meal.\n\nOur table was immediately directed to the fresh fish display in the corner of the restaurant. From this \"fresh\" display, we were able to systematically choose the fish that we wanted grilled and presented to our table. The entire time that our group deliberated our selections, our waiter continually prodded us to order items off the menu that we did have any desire to even order. Thanks, bud, but we did not want to order your steak in addition to our fish and lobster selection.\n\nOnce seated, our waiter continue to sell menu items even when we told him that what we ordered was sufficient.\n\nThe food. The food was okay. The best thing that we ordered was the Milos Special which was an appetizer shared by the table that consisted of lightly fried zucchini, eggplant tzatziki,and kefalograviera cheese. That was delicious. The meal itself sucked. The fish that we chose came out super mealy, which happens when fish is old. The texture is grainy and breaks apart. That came as a surprise because Eastiatorio Milos prides itself on flying fresh fish from the Mediterranean sea. Gross. On top of that, the lobster that we chose was serve to us...in its whole shell. We tried breaking apart the shell and dispersing it, but we were given inefficient tools that prevented us from even accomplishing that task. We had to finally flag down our waiter for him to take back the dumb dish and break apart the pieces. What the hell was he thinking?\n\nAnd our water cups were left unfilled.\n\nFor spending a pretty penny at this restaurant, the meal was really disappointing. I feel like if this restaurant was transplanted back in Los Angeles, none of this would have happened because there is a certain expectation that diners would have had since this is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant. I am not sure whether our waiter expected inexperienced out of towners who don't know any better, but I can tell you that everything about my dining experience here sucked. You suck Estaitorio Milos. I will never come back.
