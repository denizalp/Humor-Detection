This was our first visit to Vegas Discount Nutrition but we'll definitely be back! Right when we walked in there was an employee that asked what we were looking for (daily vitamins, pre-workout supplement, vegan protein powder, and amino acids). He walked us to each section of the specific aisle where the products we were looking for were at and made recommendations on what to purchase. I wish I caught the name of the employee because I wanted to give a shout out to him for being super knowledgeable and helpful.  \n\nAs far as prices go, it's really competitive. For example, the protein powder we bought was $10 cheaper here than at a grocery store. If you're into workout supplements, check this place out!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #19
