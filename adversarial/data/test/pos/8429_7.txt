The best thing about this club is having Sir Charles Barkley's bouncers toss 22 members of our crew aside like a rag dolls. Taking an elevator 2 stories up is really a dumb gimmick. \n\nI don't know how I feel about having girls in lingerie massage each other at the entrance or bathe in bathtubs of petals. I mean I love it, but I don't love myself for loving it. Know what I mean? \n\nAnyways, too loud, too packed, not enough elbow room. Either I'm getting too old for this or I'm getting too old.
