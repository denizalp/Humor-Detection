We had been trying to get to Grady's for months and for some reason or another in never worked out...until this weekend.  We headed up there for some takeout on Friday night with a hankering for the BBQ.  \n\nAfter finding the strip mall that it is in (note to those unfamiliar with the location, it's in the same strip mall as Pappy's, which has more conspicuous signage), we went inside, which was empty.  I counted a total of six chairs at two tables (not including the two chairs in the waiting area) so if you are planning to eat there, hopefully it is during a lull.  \n\nGrady greeting us promptly and gave us a tour of the menu.  We put our meat orders in, and Grady when to the back to get it going.  While he did this, his wife (I assume) helped us as we chose our sides.  The brisket dinner I ordered came with one hot side and one cold side, but I wondered if I could get double hot (mac n' cheese) instead.  She told me no, which was kind of disappointing because the menu said something about accepting all reasonable requests.  I was later super surprised and happy when my brisket came out with double mac AND the cold side, potato salad, I had ordered.  Now that's some nice service!  \n\nOn to the food, it smelled and looked great.  I had the brisket (mild sauce), *double* mac n cheese and potato salad.  The wife had a pork sandwich and cole slaw.  She liked her food and commented that she would eat there again.  My food was good, the first couple bites of brisket seemed a little chewy, but after that all was good.  I liked the flavor of the potato salad as well, though my wife thought that it was store-made.  The leftovers were also good the day after as well.\n\nThe ranking above says 4 stars, but it is really 4.5 stars.  The service was super friendly and food was very good.  I will definitely be back.
