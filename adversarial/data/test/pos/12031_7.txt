This place SUCKSSSSSSSS. Drinks are expensive and they charge a cover sometimes. A cover!?!? Idk if they still but last time I was there they did and I was like wtf. Only paid it cuz a few friends were inside already but never again. \n\nService is horrible and then they allow people to dance on the bars which was gross and almost knocked over my drink. Skip this place.
