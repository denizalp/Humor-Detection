I don't often eat Greek food even though I really do like it.  Glad the stepdaughter introduced us to Yassou!\n\nGood Greek food right off of Charleston near Summerlin.  Lots of folks visit, can tell you're in the affluent part of town because of all the cars parked outside!  Our lowly Acura was parked between a new BMW and a Mercedes coupe.  Dang did that make me feel poor.  Oh well, suck it rich people I can eat at Yassou too!\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, it definitely reminds you of the diner from that movie \"My Fat Greek Wedding\".  White & blue dually represented!  Nice little family run place.  Wasn't particularly busy in the place that day, noticed that lots of folks were doing take-out, or picking up large catering trays for glitzy parties.  \n\nMenu is displayed prominently on huge boards right above the service counter.  Kinda hard to miss!  Menu was varied, went from traditional Greek fare to items of a more modern palette.  We of course, stuck with what the Greeks know.  And what they know is pretty darn tasty.\n\nThrow the spanakopita, dolmades, and hummus aside...show me the meat!  Although I'm sure those items on the menu are probably pretty good, I was here for some carnivorous action.\n\nThe wifey and I went for the Souvlaki Combo - one beef and one chicken skewer marinated in the house lemon herbs & spices.  Our plates came with a Greek salad, rice pilaf, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce.  Overall the plate was good.  The skewers were a nice serving, and you could definitely taste the lemon and herbs throughout.  My beef skewer was juicy, but the chicken skewer was a little dry probably because it was breast meat (which tends to dry out).  The Greek salad was good with feta, tomato, cucumber, olives, and lots of red onion (which the wifey didn't really like), topped with their house vinaigrette.  Tasty.  Pita bread and the tzatziki sauce was good too, pita being warm and soft, with the tzatziki being a good complement for dipping things in to.  I wasn't a fan of the rice pilaf though, it didn't do much for me.  It's probably because I'm more of a sticky rice kinda guy.  Overall a decent plate.\n\nWhat I really should have ordered was what our kids ordered.  I almost wanted to switch halfway though our meal!  They got the popular My Big Fat Gyro - gyro sandwich with flame broiled sliced beef & lamb, feta cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce.  Along with a large order of Greek fries - fries with herbs & spices, and feta cheese.  This stuff was delish!  The thin sliced beef with the lamb, all combined into that gyro made a wonderful dish.  Was hard to put down after a few bites!  I will definitely have this instead the next time I visit Yassou.  \n\nPrices were kinda on the high side for me (I'm a cheapie eater) but I guess if you want quality food you gotta pay for it.  Our plates were about $9 each, and the gyros were a tad over $7.  Fries were separate, and cost us another $3 or so.  Servings were generous though.  On the plus side, they serve Coca-Cola!  Figure it would have been Pepsi since of the blue motif and all.\n\nThe restaurant has two different seating sections, one is in the restaurant, but there is another area on the outside in more of a patio setting.  Nice if the weather is good outside, or if you have a large party of folks with you.\n\nI'll be back.  OPA!
