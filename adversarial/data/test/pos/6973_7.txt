Sigh* Where do I start.....\n\nI've heard so much about this place in the past year but never really looked into it. Decided to check it out this past weekend and as I did a bit more research, I realized it's helmed by 2 highly popular chefs. It piqued my interest but from the mixed reviews, I kept my expectations low. Somehow, R&D still managed to fall below that. \n\nThe decor is really trendy but not what you would imagine for a place that serves asian fusion. In fact, there wasn't anything Asian about the restaurant at all except for a ginormous picture of Mao Zedong on the wall. Gave me more of a pizzeria or taco vibe. \n\nFor 2, we ordered:\n\nCSB BBQ Pork Buns ($8) - These were fantastic and really the only item I found to be worth it. The sauce and cha siu is delicious and perfectly in proportion to the amount of dough. I loved the texture of the exterior which is crispy like the top of a pineapple bun. $4 for a medium-sized bun isn't exactly a steal deal but I highly enjoyed it. 5\/5\n\nGrandpa's Fun Guo ($8) - Not bad. Served as 3 dumplings in a dimsum basket. Had me wondering where the soy sauce was but after biting into it, I realized I didn't need it. That's because the truffle gives a very strong aroma and flavor that really hits you. The dumpling skin was a bit too sticky for my tastes but it was pretty good. One of the better items but had me searching for water immediately after having it. 3.5\/5\n\nEric's Seafood & Lobster Chow Mein ($25) - I was iffy about paying this much for chow mein but decided to go for it anyways since it seemed like a popular item and was featured on the show. HUGE mistake. I still don't understand how this dish is $25. I second guess myself wondering if my taste buds lack the sophistication to fully appreciate this or if I've always had really bad chow mein my entire life. My boyfriend and I took a bite each and couldn't be bothered to take another. I'm not sure how adding a few shrimps and a piece or two of lobster hikes up the price to about three times the amount it's usually offered at. Or was it the chitarra as noodles? Either way, this dish was definitely memorable ...because I never had such a lacking and ridiculously overpriced \"chow mein\" before. This is an example of what asian fusion should not be. It's so light in flavor that it's border-lined tasteless and it was just so underwhelming in all aspects. Not to mention the noodles were cold. We asked our server to take it back which she asked why. We told her our reasons, she simply said ok and left with it. Not sure if it was conveyed to the kitchen but I had already mentally checked out of this place at this point.1\/5\n\nColonel Tso's Chicken & Waffles ($25) - Let me clarify that they no longer serve HK egg waffles but just a Belgian waffle with chicken. I didn't know this when I ordered so I couldn't help but ask the server to which he seemed genuinely surprised himself that HK egg waffles were a thing at the restaurant. He came back and informed us that they NO LONGER serve the HK egg waffles. My utter disappointment aside, I have to ask......how is this fusion? I really despise it when restaurants sprinkle some asian ingredients on a western dish and call it fusion. One, it's never cheap and two, it's a cop out of the entire term. Chicken was drizzled with kung pao sauce and seasoned with 5-spice. Overseasoned and overpowering. The breading was very thick with almost a burnt flavor to it and although it was crispy, way too heavy. Meat was dark so it made it less dry but the accompanying sauce to dip, Sichuan Maple Syrup was a disaster. It didn't complement the dish in any way so I was not a fan. Smh. 1.5\/5\n\nService was subpar. I have to agree with some reviews here that it just didn't seem like they cared. We didn't find out that they comp'd the Chow Mein til the very end which yes, made me less bitter but it would've been nice if they informed us during the meal. You know, so I could be a little less miserable and not cry for my wallet the whole time. Or perhaps a manager should've come out to speak to us since we literally ate 10% of our chow mein and we gave up halfway through the chicken & waffles. Our concerns were never addressed in a proper manner. I know a bad experience can be overlooked if the restaurant does something to alleviate it but their attempt was so half-assed that it didn't do much in terms of redemption.\n\nMy advice? Get the CSB to go.
