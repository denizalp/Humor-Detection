At a lower price point Biaggi's would be a hit, but in Madison there are many more places to get a more unique meal for the same cost or less. The thing that makes it almost worth it: the bread.\n\nI don't know if they fresh bake it or just heat it up or what but sweet pearl it might be the best focaccia I've ever had. Before our last trip I joked that I didn't need to order an entree, I could just eat an entire basket of bread and be happy. PS - that joke is 99% truth. \n\nI've previously only ever had Biaggi's in takeout or leftover form from my parents, and it was good. I particularly liked the chicken piccante stromboli (now only available as a pizza). This time I opted for the farfalle alfredo: peas, carmelized onions, red peppers, and grilled chicken. It also comes with crispy pancetta, but I ordered mine without. I don't care for fatty meat so I decided to just forego it instead of picking it out if it wasn't my jam. \n\nThe flavor was good and the predominant flavor outside of the alfredo sauce was the peas. I'm a pea fan, but I was surprised this was the star of the dish. They were also the the only contrasting texture of the dish. Everything else was pretty soft, save the pasta, which was a hair shy of al dente. It probably could have used about one more minute in the water. \n\nWhile I enjoyed my meal, it just didn't seem worth the nearly $19 I paid with tip for one bowl of pasta - no drinks or dessert or appetizers. There are a couple Italian restaurants in town at similar points that I much prefer so it just doesn't make sense to make this a go-to; I'll pay the premium when I need the focaccia in my life. \n\nOther observations: the interior of their new location is very pretty - they had some killer light fixtures and I liked the vaguely rustic look overall. The tables for two are VERY close together. We were seated right next to another couple and had maybe a foot of space between us. We could definitely hear every word of each others' conversation and it was just awkward. I had a lot of server booty in my face - not her fault at all, there was nowhere else for her to go, but not exactly my idea dining experience. \n\nTL;DR - could live without it except for the bread. I'll take 300 loaves, please.
