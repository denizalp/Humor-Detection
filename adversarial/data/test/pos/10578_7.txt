This one is for you Daniel.  Happiness. \nI had to be at work for an evening shift on this day. So I stopped by Boston Market on my way home from running errands. I had never been to this location. I actually had not been to Boston's in over a year.\nAnyway, this one is on the way home, so I gave it a try.\nLots of parking, very clean inside. So we are off to a good start.\nI ordered a few different items to go. I got the Chicken pot pie, which is great because , it only has a crust on the top.  \nAlso I got The dinner plate with ribs and chicken. Well received, and it came with 2 sides. I also got the roasted chicken dinner. It comes with 2 sides and I got a cranberry sauce on the side.\nI really wanted to get one of the Anderson Cooper lunches. Which is the Turkey dinner with the Cranberry sauce. Anderson eats one every week day for lunch. The nice young man taking my order had no idea what I was talking about, but was happy to get me a Cranberry sauce. \nHahaaa good times.\nI would come back , all the food was very good and very reasonable.
