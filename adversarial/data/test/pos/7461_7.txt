Not sure what all the fuss is about with this place.  The service was good... there were employees everywhere bussing tables and running food etc. so that was good.  The prices seemed a bit expensive.\n\nI ordered the half chicken with solterito and cilantro infused rice.  The chicken was just ok... it reminded me of a grocery store rotisserie chicken. About the same flavor but maybe a bit more greasy.  The solterito was good and the feta cheese gave it great flavor.  The cilantro infused rice was bland but after adding one of the sauces it was much better.\n\nmeh.
