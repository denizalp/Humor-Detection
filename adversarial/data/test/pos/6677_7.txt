I so want to love and support local coffee bars. With a Starbucks on the same block, I wish I could say I'll be choosing Urban Beans in the future. Unfortunately, I won't be frequenting this place. \n\nThe atmosphere is adorable, and the location is very convenient. The sweet female barista made me a \"surprise\" latte when I couldn't decide, and it was delicious! However, after waiting over ten minutes for my quiche to warm up, I approached the gentleman behind the counter. With a massive attitude, he told me it's \"not coming up because I don't see any tickets behind here a quiche on it. Go talk to her.\"\n\nOh, I'm sorry. Did my being a customer interfere with your ability to do your job?\n\nI'm just sorry I left a 15% tip before all this happened. \n\nWant a decent latte? Feel free to go to Urban Beans. Prefer good customer service? Head to Starbucks.
