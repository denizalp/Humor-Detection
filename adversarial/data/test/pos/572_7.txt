The Arcade is a Cleveland gem. Its a historic building with beautiful features that's worth stopping into visit. With vintage architecture, sweeping ceilings and open, tall ceilings, its a total gem. It is especially gorgeous during the holiday season when its adorned with wreaths, lights and seeping natural light.\n\nIs it underused? Yes. My favorite spa, Marengo, is located inside The Arcade, but there is a serious underutilization of the open store fronts. I would LOVE for the building owners to more actively recruit, retain and do more to accommodate small businesses moving in and calling it home. I sense all the potential for this once vibrant spot to be buzzing again. The Arcade Cleveland opened in May of 1890 as the first indoor shopping center in America. It quickly became one of downtown Cleveland's most popular landmarks, and was nicknamed Cleveland's Crystal Palace. \n\nShould you find yourself in Downtown, make a point to at least stop in and appreciate the history!
