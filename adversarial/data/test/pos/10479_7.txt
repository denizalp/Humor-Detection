Their make your own sandwich counter is amazing!!! I ran in before work for some kombucha + naked juice before work with plans of another airport lunch, when I noticed this awesome little counter set up in the deli. The girl at the counter was very friendly and patient with my pickiness witch says a lot! They had at least 5 bread choices + wrap options! Many protein choices,(I chose grilled chicken), lots of toppings including ARTICHOKE HEARTS, PESTO, guac, and many more! For about 5.50, I was blown away:). One suggestion is maybe add sprouts, even though with all other options, they weren't missed! I'll be back soon!:)
