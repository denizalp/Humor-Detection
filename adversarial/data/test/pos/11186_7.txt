We decided we wanted some Soul food.  Checked out my fellow yelpers, because we didn't want to go to the places we've been before.  So we came across this place.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in, we were asked if it was for here or to go!   We picked up some menus and had a seat, the very nice young lady said she would be right with us.  We well just missed the lunch menu, that's about 1\/2 the price of the dinner menu, but Ohhh well!  So I ordered the catfish special that's for us yepers It was a lot of fish!  Then I order the mac n chees.  It also came with some really good cornbread pancake.  My husband wanted Oxtails, but it was going to be a wait!  Think his 2nd choice was the short ribs.....well they were out of that also for the moment!  \nSo he went with the meatloaf, greens, yams and blackeyed peas!   The meatloaf just mealted in my mouth!  I didn't taste anything else on his plate, but it was alot of food, and he brought 1\/2 of his food home. \nMy fish I ordered it extra crunchy, it was really good.  I was very satisfied with my meal.  The food came really fast too!  It wasn't even 5 min.  \n\nThe young lady that waited on us was really friendly, she also told us the history of how this place got started.  And low and behold, he started this because he worked and another soul food place.  And it's better than the place he use to work at!  \n\nMy husband can't wait to go back and try the oxtails and the short ribs.  Soooooooooooo, we will be back!
