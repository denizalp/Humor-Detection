Nice atmosphere, good, solid service, good food and BASIL 'N LIME DOES NOT DUMB DOWN THE SPICE SO BE WARNED!\n\nI had a Thai iced tea which was earthy and tasty.\n\nFor the entree I ordered kang pahr.  I asked the server how it compared to a panang curry or red curry and all she said was \"It's hotter.\"\n\nIt had a clear broth for the curry with bamboo shoots, baby corn, eggplant, carrot, green bean and lime leaf.  I ordered it with chicken.  It also had plentiful dried hot peppers and Thai peppers (an interesting looking thing if ever there was one, see photos).  I enjoyed the kang pahr and having a hot (I ordered it hot but I wasn't brave enough to order it Thai hot after she said \"It's hot.\") curry dish without the coconut milk base was nice.\n\nThe chicken was good as were the veggies.  A couple of eggplant pieces had a slightly tough hide.\n\nI liked the food and look forward to a return trip to try some other dishes.
