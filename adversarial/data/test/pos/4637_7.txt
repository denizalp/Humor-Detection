Soyo now gets the five star treatment from me.  Service is always excellent and is able to cater to my party, whether it's two people or twelve people.  They have no problem pushing together several tables to accomodate large parties.  The staff here is extremely friendly and very open about their menu.  Not only will they tell you what is good, they'll also tell you what is not so good.  I think one big thing that Soyo has going for them is that the staff speaks English pretty well, which makes things a bit more convenient for us non-Koreans.\n\nI can safely say that food here has remained consistent, since my friends and I have ordered the same dishes many times over several visits.  The Budae Jjigae is still delicious, and if you ask them for more broth\/soup they will bring it!  We asked for enough refills on soup last time that they even gave us more ramen noodles.  They know we enjoy their jjigae.\n\nWe're now on a mission to try the whole menu, and everything we've tried has been good.  Recently I've tried the Blood Sausage and the Very Spicy Chicken.  The blood sausage was tasty, and came with some vegetables and clear noodles.  The Very Spicy Chicken is very spicy (spicy in, spicy out).  Order it mild or medium, and you have a delicious chicken dish with some spice and mozarella cheese on top.\n\nThere are also special nights throughout the week now.  Tuesday nights are ladies night, where you can get drink specials if your party has 3 or more girls; no guys allowed in your party though!  I believe the drink special was 2 for 1 drinks, but I'm not positive (I'm not a lady, so it doesn't apply to me!)  On Wednesday through Sunday nights, if your party spends around $75 you get to spin their wheel.  Prizes range from nothing, to free cocktails\/beer, to a $50 credit for food.  Lucky for me, the group I go with will almost always spend $75!\n\nIt is safe to say that Soyo is easily one of my top Repeat Eats!  Enough so that now there's a new Yelp Las Vegas acronym: SUYE (Soyo UYE)!
