You'll see more Hermes bags, flashy Rolexes, and giant glittering diamonds here on a Saturday afternoon than you may see in an entire weekend at the Chateau Marmont. Don't let the flashing jewels fool you: this place is just another run-of-the-mill Vietnamese salon, with young girls gossiping away in another language, lone hovering overseeing male figure (i.e., \"the pimp\"), dirty instruments, and all. \n\nI came in with moderately grown out nails and one broken short nail, and wanted them all cut down to match the stumpy one. The answer I got? \"Long nail pretty.\" No, really, I want them shorter. \"Long nail pretty!\" and so I got 9 long, ghetto-square nails and one short rounded nail. Shock of shocks, two of the long square ones chipped within 24 hours. \n\nEven though this salon offers an array of 2-week gel polishes (Gelish and CNS Shellac), I doubt I'll be back. What's the point of paying $12+tip for a mani if you have to redo it yourself the following night?
