Welcome to Moe's! This Moe's in the Epicenter. Same Moe's experience as others that I've been to with the ordering of your burrito or whatever, passing down the assembly line of adding starches, proteins and veggies to it. Once paid, there's the usual (excellent!) salsa bar of Moe's salsas.\n\nOn the plus side, it was not especially busy when I popped in for a quesadilla to go.\n\nMoe's!
