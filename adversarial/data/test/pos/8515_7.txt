Hubby and I happened to be in the area; I was so elated to catch Wow! Sushi in it's opening week. \n\nWe were here to experience:\n- Eating at a \"Hot and New\" restaurant in Canada\n- Having torched sushi (beware the plate is HOT)\n- Watching animated bonito flakes wave around from the heat coming off the food.\n\nRestaurant is small and bright. The waitress was polite,  pleasant and attentive. She greeted us at the door, sat us at a table by the window and immediately served us complimentary miso soup and piping hot green tea made with toasted or roasted rice. The chef came to our table to serve us our complimentary appetizer of deep fried tofu with katsuo-bushi (bonito flakes); watching the flakes dance definitely kept me entertained!\n\nWe ordered the calamari appetizer that came with a small side of mayo sprinkled with spices, the Japango roll (a spicy California roll with salmon and a scallop on top) and the Salmon Teriyaki Lunch which came with a small bowl of white rice.\n\nEverything was tasty but my favorite was the deep fried tofu (deliciously soft and not spongy) and the Japango roll (tender scallop with a nice tingle of spice). The flavor of the miso soup was a little too strong for my taste, the salmon and steamed veggie side was a little overcooked and the calamari was more chewy than I like (hubby actually prefers it this way). So overall I would rate it a solid 3.5 stars, rounded up for the hospitality of the staff.
