Cakes by Robert is an amazing bakery, filled with fresh and delicious baked products that are 100% NUT FREE!\n\nTheir baked goods are always fresh with the most delicious cake that is moist and remains moist for days after it is baked. To finish it off, the store only uses buttercream icing, which is just smooth and creamy and literally melts in your mouth.\n\nOpened during the year of my birth (1984), I am sad I only discovered this birthday cake heaven this year BUT happy that I can now partake in their yummy treats and use Cakes by Robert for all of my party needs or when I have a craving from my good old sweet tooth.\n\nFirst off, this store offers 1000's of designs to choose from when it comes to customizing your cake, cupcakes, cookie cakes or special edible loot bags.\n\nYou can either go with one of their pre-made designs or bring in a picture to screen onto a cake or a picture of a cake that will give the bakers a concept of what you want.\n\nAnd for all of you brides-to-be out there, this delicious bakery does wedding cakes and treats for your upcoming engagement parties and\/or bridal showers!
