The Student Union is really a useful place to study and eat. So if you don't mind a little noise, chow down on Panda Express, Starbucks, Taco Bell, Metro Pizza, Subway, Greens To Go, or Jamba Juice. If you need a small little snack to last you through class, you can grab one at the vending machines or the POD, which has a variety of to-go items and essentials like Tylenol. \n\nThe food isn't that special, but since when was school food ever good? \n\nThe second floor has some quieter, more private seating where you can study. It also houses the ballroom and most of the meeting rooms, where most student organizations and events gather. \n\nThe third floor contains your student government offices, so if you have a concern or question...now you know where to go! There's no seating up there, it's not a study area! \n\nIf you need to be on campus and you're dying from hunger, this is the place to be! Just use your Rebel Card to save on tax!
