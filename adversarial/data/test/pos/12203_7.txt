Disgusting.   Not only the food, but also the atrocious amount of waste.  \n\nI weighed the packaging after I removed my meals from the box.  18 POUNDS OF WASTE.  About 2 pounds of food. It is the most ridiculous thing to see. This HUGE box holding cardboard and insulation and enormous ice packs ... And then, these little packages of food (in plastics trays with a cardboard cover wrapped around it to make sure they are being as environmentally repugnant as possible)\n\nThe food is quite awful.  But, hey, it could be a great weight loss method. Buy food that you will only eat a few bites of, and do overhead presses and squats with the 20 pound box of garbage.  \n\nTotally makes sense.
