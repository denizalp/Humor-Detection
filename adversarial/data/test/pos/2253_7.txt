Marvelous food in a rather unusual setting. I love the beer selections (East End Big Hops on tap, for example). The food is locally sourced from an impressive list of local and organic farms. Surprisingly diverse menu, with vegetarian options. \n\nFranktuary original location was Downtown at Trinity Cathedral. They have kept that history as an imaginative theme. It all makes sense, given the role monasteries played in developing great beer. It turns out that a church themed bar can be a marvelous way to spend an evening.
