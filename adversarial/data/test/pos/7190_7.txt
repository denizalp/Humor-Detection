I am completely and utterly disappointed in my experience with Aabies. Before I even traveled the 1 hour drive to get to the salon I called and asked could I get pricing if I sent a picture. I was told I could. So I did. I was given the price. And told to come to the North Tryon location. As soon as I arrived they tried to talk me out of what I said I specifically wanted. Then told me it was too much work for the price I was told and giving me another price at least $30 higher. Mind you for a 7 year old child. Then to make matters worse there was no customer service, I felt as if I was getting talked about right in front of my face as they talked in their native language about me expecting what I was told before I even traveled there. Then I guess she decided to start but began doing something completely different than what I had asked for because \"that's what she felt comfortable doing\" . I brought it to her attention and she took it a loose and told me to go to the other Aabies up the street because they had more skilled braiders. Reluctantly I went because I'd come this far I get there and they tell me $20 more dollars than what I was told up the street. Needless to say I left and will not ever return and will make sure everybody knows what experience I had that I come into contact with. I'm sure this won't make it on their site as they screen the bad ones and only show you what they won't you to see. Nonetheless I'm an avid Googler\/Yelper and will post this there as well. Buyer beware, I'm sure your time and money would be more appreciated elsewhere. Smh  0 Stars!
