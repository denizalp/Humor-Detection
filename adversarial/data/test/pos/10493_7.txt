My party of 6 was tired, since we just returned from the Grand Canyon in time for dinner, but, we did not have a dinner reservation. So we collectively opted for this restaurant based on Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews. Although we did not have reservations, when we arrived around 7:30pm I felt we were lucky to be seated outside almost immediately. The restaurant offers both inside and outside perimeter dinning. The weather in November was spectacular for outside dinning.\n\nMy party of 6 enjoyed our dinners here. I would return.
