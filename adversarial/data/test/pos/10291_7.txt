**Vegetarian Friendly**\n\nI absolutely LOVE tacos and have been looking for my new favorite place. This place was meh. I've had better tacos. \n\nI ordered one cheese enchilada and one hard taco. By the time I got my taco it was already soggy, and I absolutely dislike a soggy taco. My taco only had beans and cheese, and I would have liked some other toppings to be included such as lettuce or a pico. The cheese enchilada was tiny and came with a side of refried beans and rice. The rice wasn't very flavorful, and the the red enchilada sauce was very bland. Each meal is served with a side of red and green salsa but they weren't to my tasting. I also got a churro, which good. It was warm, crispy and sugary. I would l have liked more cinnamon. \n\nThey had lots of standard items that could have the meat switched out for refried beans to make it vegetarian. \n\nI wish they had a salsa bar, served chips with your meal instead of a tortilla, and had black beans as option. Overall, it wasn't anything special to me.
