Food was great for the price! I mean \"All you can eat meat\" , for less than most all you can eat sushi. Our Waitress Jessica was very attentive and was there for all our questions and wants. Definitely a thumbs up on this place! Oh yeah and the ice cream macarons are the bomb don't forget to get some for desert!
