My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...\n\nThis place? \n\nGet white girl wasted on paninis and soup.\nWifi for those piczZZ\nNorth Hills price but on the waterfront.\nShut up about your diet and get a cookie.\nAnd a bagel for the morning.
