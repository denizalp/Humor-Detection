My hair stylist Tony just moved back to this location from a different salon. And all I can say is yes!!!!!! I can get my hair done and go shopping afterwards! \n\nI'm having my second baby is November and I needed a lot of my hair cut off. What mom to a newborn baby wants to deal with a bunch of hair? I told him I wanted it a little passed shoulder length with a bunch of layers all over. I showed him a few pictures and he got to work chopping off almost 9 inches of hair.\n\nThe salon is super chic. The other stylists were nice and busy working on their own clients. Besides getting your hair done, you can also get your nails done as well. They offer coffee and cucumber water at the front while you wait for your stylist to finish up other clients. As long as my guy Tony is here, I'll for sure come back.
