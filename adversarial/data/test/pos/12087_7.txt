You know a real good way to get around shady consignment methodologies? Don't consign! Not going to wear the items in the back of your closet anymore? Give them away- half of them will go to the Drop In Centre or something anyways if they can't be sold at a shop. Hell, get in touch with me, I could probably list a handful of local women's groups right now that could really use some hand me downs. \n\nWant to take the risk anyways? Drop your clothes off at Trends so I can shop them. I find Trends a pretty decent consignment store in the city as a consumer. They manage to group their clothing by colour, which I find very visually pleasing. Pricing is mostly fair, from what I've purchased. And, if I think a used item of clothing is too much, I simply don't buy it. I love the concept of second hand clothing and resisting the consumption of new clothes at a mall or some other soul sucking institution when I could check Trends first. Plus, when I was at Market Collective last, they stopped by at all the vendor's tables with vouchers which I thought was super sweet of them, to get involved with a local community event. Just another reminder to pay a visit or two in the near future.\n\nIf you are looking for \"vintage\" consignment, you probably won't find it here. I've noticed Trends provides mostly mid-range, modern brands- Banana Republic, Tahlua, Jacobs, etc with a few exceptions. I am not the hugest shopper at all, but when in Kensington, I like to stop by Trends and see what they have to offer.
