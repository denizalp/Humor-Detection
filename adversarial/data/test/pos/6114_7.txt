Vets to Go is a brilliant concept-basically vets that make house calls for everything from looking at an injury to annual check ups.  Why is this good?  I'm the owner of a leash reactive dog. In my dog's case, she enjoys playing and greeting other dogs so much that she becomes intensely frustrated when she is restrained. The result is barking, snarling and a very stressed out dog. While I continue to work with her on this, taking her to the regular vet where we can't control other variables (other dogs, small spaces) is stressful at best. So as you can imagine I was quite intrigued about this service. The other added bonus is that they do appointments in the evenings and on weekends, 7 days a week (depending on availability). And yes, they do cats too, which is how I found out about them :)\n\nThe vet arrived promptly, at our exact appointment time (already had one up on most regular vet visits with that). She was friendly, let both my dogs check her out. She took down a brief history on the patient and asked if there were any concerns or issues. She then did a thorough exam (just as much if not more than they'd get at the vets office).  My dog rolled around the kitchen floor, basking in the attention, occasionally dolling out kisses.  At one point, she was so relaxed she dozed off. She then received her annual shots without so much as a twitch and earned several hypoallergenic dog biscuits for good behaviour. I then got a thorough rundown of her health and a recommendation on a dental food product I could get at any pet store to keep her teeth clean-no hard selling of products! She also let me know about optional vaccines without being pushy.\n\nThey even bring a portable credit card\/debit machine! The cost of the visit was the same as a regular vet visit too. She let me know all records would be emailed within the week and I could always ask for copies if I lost the email later.\n\nWhen the visit was done, she asked if our other dog could join us so they could both have treats and see each other was okay. They loved that ! I mean, who doesn't love a cookie bearing visitor that scratches your belly?The whole visit was less than 30 minutes and zero stress. Whether you have  a perfect dog (or cat) or one that needs a little work like mine, I highly recommend this service.
