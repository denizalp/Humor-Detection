I've spent a more than a few nights getting a little too drunk around the corner at Montauk (also a five star establishment), and PACT is a welcome addition to this hood. This hood is thirsty for bars, and dreamz are finally coming true. \n\nThey're slinging beer and the usual suspects of cheap draft and reasonably priced cocktails and shots. They're a large establishment and from the looks of it pretty soon they will have a large patio to match. Don't let their address fool you, they are tucked just around the corner on Markham. \n\nThere is a dart board. I am a fucking sucker for a dart board.
