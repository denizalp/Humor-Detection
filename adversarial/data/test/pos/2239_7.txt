After our Kohl's experience, I noticed my Grandmother was due for a nail fill. There was a nail shop next to the Kohl's (sadly, can't remember the shop) and my Mom, Daughter and Grandma all got their nails done and I ran across the parking lot to this shop to get some beverages. \n\nThe owners were super sweet and though I wasn't in the mood for ice cream, I did try the coffee flavor and the taste I had was heavenly. I had delicious iced tea and bought cans of pop for everyone else.
