Stopped in to grab a birthday card and gift card for an afternoon party and was in there way too long. There was a long line at the only open register when we walked in and it never got any shorter. Customers kept coming in, but they continued to operate with only one register.  They did, however, have a nice selection of gift cards and greeting cards.
