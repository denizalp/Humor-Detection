WORST AYCE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Food was slow (never got all of it), store owner was CRAYCRAY DRUNK OFF HIS ASS, and he told us, \"Get the FUCK out of here and don't FUCKING come back.\"  word for word.\n\nHere's the the story: My friends and I chose to come here over another AYCE sushi place. We ordered at least 7 rolls plus small things first. After 1.5 hours, we got 4 rolls (one repeated twice) and a few of the other stuff. Throughout the 1.5 hours, my friend asked the waitresses\/waiter where the rest of our food was. They apologized. In the meantime, I saw the chef, restaurant owner, and customers enjoying sake bombs and beers. My friend, who has been here several times, calmly explained to the waiter that we haven't received everything we ordered yet after 1.5 hours and that service has not been up to par. He asked to speak to the manager directly. The DRUNK OWNER comes wobbling over with BEER IN HIS HAND, and pats my friend on his back several times. He tells us, \"What's going on? If you're going to complain then get the FUCK OUT OF HERE.\" Let me remind you, my friend was not rude at all. He said he is a frequent customer here and that today's service was not at all like the other times he's been here. The owner then YELLS at his EMPLOYEES!!! and comes back, unknowingly spills beer on my friend, and tells us \"Meal is on me, now get the FUCK out of here. If you want all you can eat, don't FUCKING come back!\" Another waitress had to pull him away from our table as he continued to mumble and yell toward us, while the waiter\/waitress\/head chef came to our table to apologize for their manager's behavior.\n\nHOW PATHETIC to have the employees apologize FOR the incoherent owner!!! FIRST AND LAST TIME HERE!!! I'm going to Yama Sushi. Please don't enable this sort of owner's behavior. WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!
