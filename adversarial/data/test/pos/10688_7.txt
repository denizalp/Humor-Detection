Baby, don't do it. Dr. Hicks is not my pick! I went to this office and had my teeth cleaned and thought they had on gloves laced with led and using drywall tools on my gums.\n\nI wanted a simple cleaning and was told I needed to have extensive work, not true my gums are fine and only went to slick Hick because a friend recommended her. Now that friend has been dealt with, I had to send her a slap-a-gram and a b*tch are you crazy email. I digress! \n\nAvoid these masked robbers, I mean dental professionals. The doctor told me I needed a root canal and wanted to put a temporary silver cap over my tooth until the super expensive porcelain arrived. Excuse, me? Did you just say SILVER? Who do I look like, Flavor Flav or Little Wheezy's play cousin?!? I told her to take her antiquated practice back to the dark ages and get me the heeeeell out of there. I grabbed my things, bolted for the door, and my tires screeched out of the parking lot like she was the poltergeist! Run Carol Ann, run toward the light, Carol Ann!!
