Okay, I hate Walgreen's because of their stance on dispensing drugs (if the pharmacist has some religious objection to your birth control, he can refuse to dispense it. That's CRAP). \n\nBut, they're the only ones that carry the one brand of hosiery that doesn't make me stabby. So, fine. I have to go here every other week.
