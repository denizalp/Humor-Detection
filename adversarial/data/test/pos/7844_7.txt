Craving pho this cold and rainy night and instead of Saigon 8 in Henderson, our usual pho restaurant, We decided to  try out Pho Little Saigon , which was across the street from Saigon 8.  \n\nThere were 4 other people in Little Saigon when we pulled up and there was lots of room with plenty of tables and chairs. First thing I noticed was the large chinese food menu right by the front door, hmmmm, I can feel my hopes being slightly dashed at this point , but we've made it this far, so we went on in. \n\nI ordered my usual  Noodle soup with rare eye round steak & beef meatballs and Tanya got her usual Grilled shrimps and sliced pork over vermicelli and vegetables for comparison against Saigon 8's. \n\nFor my dish, the main complaint was broth wasn't as rich as I was used to and the meatballs had a different texture than what I was used to. Everything else was similar. For Tanya, her bbq pork was not as tasty and she ate something that tasted like bad fish (twice!) in her bowl. She could not figure out where that taste came from.  Prices are slightly higher than Saigon 8, for the exact same meal, we would have paid about $2 less across the street.
