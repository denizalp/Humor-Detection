Several years ago my cousin introduced me to Vietnamese sandwiches and I have been in love with them ever Since! \n\nWhile some of my favorite spots are downtown, I must say that the service here has been incredible! The guy who makes the sandwiches here really take his time to make sure they are to the highest standard. I especially like that we toasts my bread, it may not be authentic but I like the warm bread. The spread he uses has a nice tangy taste and a spicy finish. He does have all the meat selections, at this place the beef is my favorite, even thou I prefer pork. \n\nThey really have the art of sandwich making good ingredients combined with great service! This is why I go out of my way sometimes to come here. I highly recommend this place.
