I have stayed at the Jockey Club many times.  The location can't be beat, smack dab in the middle of the Strip, nestled between the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.  And if you ask nicely when you check in and it's available, you'll get a view of those fabulous Bellagio fountains.  But even if you don't win that lottery, I hope you're not in Vegas to stay in your room!\n\nI feel as though I must address some of the comments written by some reviewers here.\n\nTwo main points are very important.  First, too many reviews talk about being roped into timeshare presentations and getting snagged into long, haranguing and abusive presentations in an effort to buy a timeshare at the Jockey Club.  Take note:  The people who do this are NOT selling the Jockey Club, which sold out years ago.  They are selling membership in a dubious vacation club.  The don't represent the Jockey Club.  They don't work for the Jockey Club.  They simply rent space in a booth opposite the front desk.  I know this for a fact, and that fact can easily be verified.  \n\nSecond, there was a major renovation just a couple of years ago, and the rooms look nothing like many of the old photos shown on Yelp.  Towels are changed and trash is emptied daily, and a full cleaning is provided for stays of a week.  While the current decor may not be everyone's taste (whatever is?), it's not some of the old stuff seen here, and isn't even the old horse-themed upholstery from years ago, when I first started staying there.  The photos that are correct are the ones with red and gold.\n\nI can't think of a better place to stay on the Strip - for the price, which is unbelievably reasonable, you get a whole apartment, with a full kitchen and free parking.  I don't know what will happen with the free parking in the future, now that MGM has set off their firestorm about charging for parking.  Other hotels are likely to follow suit, and it all depends on what kind of agreement they have with the Cosmopolitan.  Time will tell.\n\nJust stay away from those predators in the booth, and you'll have little reason to complain!
