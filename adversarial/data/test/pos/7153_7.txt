Only been to this theater twice. Three at the most, as of my latest visit to this theater to finally watch Dunkirk.  It is located in this strip mall a block away from the Eastern and 215 exit, which has ample parking and neighboring businesses that collectively does not draw all that much foot traffic, in spite of some which might actually be pretty good restaurants.\n\nIt is not a new theater or has undergone renovations to be equipped with fewer but much more comfortable and fancier seats, but it does have a lot of screens to show the latest movie releases, as well as, movies that have been out for awhile and probably no longer shown at the majority of other theaters in the Vegas valley. That is a plus for me.\n\nThe staff here keeps the theaters and restroom tidy and clean. The few I did interact with when buying the tickets or showing them the tickets I purchased, have all been friendly, so not really anything to complain about.\n\nIf you frequent Regal theaters a lot, be sure to sign up for their Regal Crown Club and download their App to collect credits to redeem for upgrades on sodas, popcorns, free movie tickets and movie merchandises.  Plus there are promos to earn extra credits or to enter their sweepstakes.\n\nPro Tip:  If you watch movies a lot and buy a lot of movie gift certificates, I highly recommend that you go to Costco's website and check out MoviePass annual subscription for $89.99. Personally I already spent that much just in the first 3 weeks of getting my MoviePass debit card and watched 13 movies.
