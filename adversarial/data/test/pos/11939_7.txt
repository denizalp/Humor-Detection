This is probably one of the nicest Marshalls in Charlotte. \n\nI never seem to go here when I need something specific. It's always a, \"hey, I'm in Cotswold. I should probably go wander around Marshalls.\" Also, this is how people get lost in black holes. \n\nI tend to get super overwhelmed at stores like this, but this location doesn't seem as cluttered. They do a pretty good job maintaining it. This location has a huge selection of beauty products. A lot of face washes, wipes, masks, etc. I usually always find some item I (don't) need. \n\nIt's kind of hard to get out of this parking lot if you're trying to make a left hand turn (lot of traffic). I usually go down to the Smashburger and hit the light.
