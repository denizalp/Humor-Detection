VEGAS. Yes I am a rookie here but there are something you need to work on. \n\n1) Customer Service: You charge double for crappy service and treat your guest like crap because you can. \n\n2) Food- again you charge double for everything for mediocre things because you can. \n\n3) Tipping - why should I tip you extra for DOING YOUR JOB. I have worked in a tipping industry but I never expect tips, you do. \n\nI am honestly not a big fan of Vegas. I would rather go to some place WAY nice and pay the prices you charge for things and get better service and quality than waste my money here.
