Still a fan of MTO, but I had to write a quick update.  I frequently get their tomato soup and grilled cheese.  It's a great combo.  Found out today it is ONLY sold as a combo.  \n\nToday I just order the tomato soup and when bill came was charged $7 for a cup of soup.  I asked waiter why it was same price as the combo and he said because it's ONLY sold as a combo.  Huh? Ok, no big deal, but wish he had told me this bit of info when I ordered. I guess I should've asked how much is JUST a cup of soup.  \n\nThe manager came over and asked if everything was ok, so I mentioned how I really enjoyed the soup, but didn't realize if I ordered only soup I'd be charged for full combo.  She simply parroted the server and said we only sell soup as a combo with grilled cheese.  \n\nI get it! It's a COMBO!  Good deal for $7, super tasty, just don't; try ordering either item separately, or be prepared to pay for full cost of combo.  :-)
