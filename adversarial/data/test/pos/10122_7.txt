I had just got off the plane to sin city and had a hankering for some pho. Nothing fancy, no buffet or big juicy steak, just some pho. I used my yelp app and found this place just a few miles from the airport. While driving there I almost missed it because my gps seemed off ( pointing to the other side of the street). We figured it was on the OTHER side of the street and when going into the shopping center almost missing it because the physical location was in HHS form of Silver Diner. I mean one doesn't expect to see a Vietnamese joint in the form of an old 50's style diner. At least put a guy in a rice hat squatting out front cooking some fish over a some charcoal to make it more obvious. \n\nI'm just kidding about that....he should be squatting and smoking a cigarette.\n\nI was wondering if Alice or Flo were gonna take our order and then we'd see Mel throw a couple of bowls of pho in the kitchen window and (DING!) yell \"PICKUP!\". If you didn't get that reference you're too dam young or you didn't grow up here.\n\nMoving on. The inside does have the look and feel of an old diner. It almost feels like its a double wide trailer. I like it. We were seated right away at a table by the window with  comfy chairs. They have a big menu. With lots of choices. Noodle(vermicelli) dishes with BBQ pork, chicken or cat. Just kidding, dog. Haha! Beef dammit. There's something about the way Vietnamese prepare their meat, it tastes fresh, sweet and has that nice char. \nA good selection of appetizers like spring rolls ( made with rice paper and not fried), but also some fried rolls. They had some banh mi, those sanwhiches on a baguette with pork, cilantro, pickled carrots and radish. Plenty of rices dishes, if you didn't care for noodles.\n\nAnd of course, what I came for, pho. Which I ordered with rare beef flank, tendons and tripe. That's right, give me that pink and nasty gushy stuff. I also ordered some homemade pork sausage spring rolls. Which were pretty frickin awesome. The sausage was grilled so it had a crispy outside and then thinly sliced. There was an element that I never had in a fresh spring roll as well, they put a stick of fried won ton wrapper inside, that gave it that extra crunch when biting into it. It was like eating a fried roll....but not. I washed that down with a glass of freshly squeezed limeade. Served in a tall fountain glass with extra long spoon. \n\nThen they brought the pho out. (I like how they waited for us to finish the appetizer first). The broth was good, but I needed to add some chilli sauce for that extra kick. Threw in the fresh basil off the twig, sprouts and jalepe√±os and BOOM I was very satisfied. After slurping on it like I was eating some late night macaroni and cheese, I reached the bottom of the bowl. All done. Take my money I'm out. \n\nThe service was good and I feel like they had some kind of edge serving out of that diner.
