Don't bother with guestlist if you're trying to see a big headliner, just buy presale so you don't wait for hours just to get in!\n\nIt's great that there's always a good headliner DJ playing every weekend in Vegas, thanks to their resident lineup, but the biggest problems here are the layout and the management.\n\nThe layout is like an up-and-down maze. The steps are always overcrowded with people, so watch your step or you'll be playing dominoes in human form. If you want to avoid the crowded dancefloor (and getting stepped on by high heels nonstop), it's good to escape upstairs, but there really isn't an area to dance. You do get a good view of the fancy lights and effects.\n\nThe management is pretty bad. In my past experiences dealing with the promoters here, they are pretty rude or just inadequate in helping you get into the venue without some catch.
