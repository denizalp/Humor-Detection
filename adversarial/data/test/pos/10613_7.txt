My favourite restaurant meal in a very long time.\n\nWe came here to celebrate my daughter's birthday. We had a 7:45 reservation and were promptly seated at the appointed time.  The menu, which is essentially piece of paper attached to a chunk of wood, is not very extensive, but manages to cover several different groups of proteins in its half dozen entree offerings plus the one entree special.  \n\nWe started off with the yam beignets off the regular menu and the lamb neck peirogies from the days specials. I am sure that if Shakespeare were alive he would have written a sonnet about the beignets! Some beignet with a little goat cheese and jalapeno aioli was the perfect, melt in the mouth bite.\n\nI ordered the chicken breast for my main. Nice and moist with a crispy skin, yum!  The steel - cut oatmeal risotto provided the well seasoned complement to the chicken.  My dinner companions had ordered pork and steak and were as equally enamoured with their dishes. \n\nFor dessert we shared a plate of their homemade doughnuts. These were the perfect sweet bite to finish our meal, and to our delight, they were comped on our bill as a gift to the birthday girl. \n\nThe next time I am in Calgary I will be certain to have a meal at Market.
