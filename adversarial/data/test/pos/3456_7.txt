Worst experience ever.. I yelped hoping to find a good barber shop in Vegas and I found this place that was 5 stars.\n\nCame here and waited over 2 hours to get a haircut. Asked for a simple fade and it came out okay. \n\nAt the end, I did saw something weird about my haircut, but he put gel over my head so I wasn't so sure until I came home and took a shower and saw the outcome of it.\n\nHe made my head so uneven, now I have to buzz my hair to even it out and grow it out all over.
