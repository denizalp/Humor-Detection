I get the hype!\n\nCame here a few weeks ago with a groupon for dinner. Honestly, dinner buffet is a great deal even without the groupon.\n\nThe food is excellent. Authentic and delicious, and they do the buffet right. The food is always hot, and they bring out fresh dishes often so that nothing sits out long or gets cold. Yes, the food is meat-centric and greasy, but that's just Phillipine cuisine for you. \n\nThe one thing I was disappointed in was the service. While our waitress was super friendly and even gave us free tea and cookies, the service was shockingly slow. I think the issue was that our waitress was also cooking, so she was very busy. Maybe Mabuhay should think about hiring a few extra people to help work the tables. The three parties (including us) that were finished eating waited ~20mins to pay. We even got up and went looking for our waitress at one point. \n\nCome here expecting great food and very kind service for very low cost, but know that you'll be here for a while.
