Ahhhh mcfaddens, my favorite Irish\/college bar. I've been coming here for a few years and I LOVE it shamelessly. It's literally like a frat party in here every weekend packed with easy, hot girls, cheap quality drinks, and amazing food.\n\nI love all their crazy mixed drinks, contests\/giveaways, and also free ros√©\/champagne for ladies on the weekends. \n\nTheir pulled pork poutine, tenders, pot pie, and other food selections are to DIE for. My food has always been made to perfection with exceptional service. My favorite bartenders here are Trisha and Ryan. I often come to visit her because she serves me in a timely manner, always has a smile on her face, and has a great attitude. Ryan is very professional, fun, and informative! He really runs the place.
