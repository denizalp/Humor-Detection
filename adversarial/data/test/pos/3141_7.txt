Here's the thing: I love dive bars. \n\nThis place is IT. \n\nTiny lil dirty, cozy bar. Pool tables, darts, sport ball games on tv, great tunes on the jukebox, friendly bartenders. We watch our Wineburgers get tossed onto the griddle, along with a giant pile of onions, getting slow cooked with wine while we sip on cheap beers in ice cold glasses. \n\nDon't get the Super Delux Wineburger unless you're REALLY hungry. These burgers are hearty. Especially since they come with fries. And you know you're getting a drink or two. Onion rings are pretty alright, so get those if you're still hungry.\n\nWe came in on Friday night and got to watch the adorable cook dance and sing to Bruno Mars blasting on the jukebox. You should come for this alone. Such a great atmosphere. I'll definitely be back for happy hour or late night shenanigans.\n\nPersonal sidenote: I told my mom I came here and, like everything else I think I've had a first experience at, she very calmly informed me that I've already been when I was young. I love my parents. Bringing kids to bars since the 90s. No shame.
