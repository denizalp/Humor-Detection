As the day before my father's birthday rolled around, I scrambled about trying to think of what to get him. Think, Manny, think! \n\nThen, it hit me. A pie! \n\nErr, not literally, of course.\n\nMy dad loves pies. So this year I thought I would fulfill my filial duty by fattening him up and indulging his sweet tooth. I did a quick online search for bakeries in Phoenix that deliver, as I live elsewhere and couldn't give it to him personally, and stumbled upon their website.\n\nI browsed through their extensive selection of different flavored cupcakes, fruit pies, cheesecakes, cookies, etc. Some of the items are pricey, but it seems like $5 for a cupcake is becoming the new American standard. In comparison, I felt the pies were more reasonably priced.\n\nBest of all, they take online and phone orders and can get things delivered with minimal notice. Their website says they can only process orders made at least 2 days in advance, but they were able to do it with only one day advance notice for me. When I called my dad after his birthday, he thanked me for the pie, saying it was delicious. I was beaming.\n\nNow, the only thing left for me is to actually taste something from here next time. :\/
