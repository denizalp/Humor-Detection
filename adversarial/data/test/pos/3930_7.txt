All of my friends talk about this place.  I see it all the time on the Travel Channel.  Last week I decided to give it a try.   Had to try the signature Frozen Hot Chocolate, of course.  Since D and I were starving when we got there, we also ordered a jalepeno pretzel and a cheese pizza.  \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate - First of all, it was 10 bucks for a size comparable to Starbucks Grande size.  Second of all, it tasted worse than a grande chocolate frapachino.  Nasty powder chunks in the drink, and not even very chocolatey.  Save your money and your taste buds, go to starbucks.\n\nJalepeno Pretzel - 8 bucks.  Totally not worth it.  Tasted like spicy cardboard.  Go eat some desert sand.  I'm sure it will taste better.\n\nCheese Pizza - 10 bucks.  Tasted like a 5 year old made a pizza in an Easy Bake Oven. \n\nThe worst part....  we waited over 30 min in line.\n\nDon't think I'll be heading back there.......
