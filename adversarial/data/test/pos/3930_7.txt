I don't get it. Why is this place famous? Because they put gross, soggy fries on their bland tasting subs? The food here just doesn't even come close to matching the hype.\n\nEven when I was drunk as hell, I found that a hot, fresh sausage sandwich right off the grill from one of the street vendors was much more satisfying than one of Primanti Bros' greasy, flavorless subs.\n\nIf you want to eat at a famous Pittsburgh institution, go get a hot dog and fries at The Original. Granted, you might get shot, but, hey, it's worth the risk.
