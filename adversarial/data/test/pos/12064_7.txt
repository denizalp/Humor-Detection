My MIL and I dropped in for lunch. \n\nShe got the 2 pizza slice special with a soda. She said it was OK, but she decided to take it home and reheat it and it tasted better the next day with the sauce sopped up into the crust. Otherwise the crust was a bit generic.\n\nI got a stromboli with meatball. Nice sized portion and the meatballs were decent, but the crust on the bottom was a little doughy so I ate mostly what was on top. Their marinara for it was decent - not too sweet or tangy. \n\nDecent enough spot it seems for pizza type goods, but it fell about middle of the road for me. I still havent found my near the house pizza spot just yet. Check out the board or counter for some papers with lunch specials and daily family style specials as those seem to make for a good deal.
