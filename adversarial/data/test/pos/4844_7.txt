This restaurant was excellent! For a girls weekend in Vegas I had tried to cut down on pizza and other unhealthy foods but when we got there, all bets were off. So on our last night we headed over towards Aria and had gluten free pizza at this awesome place. The restaurant is located in a mall between the Aria and Cosmo, which is probably the only negative because it doesn't offer any cool views of the hotels or the Strip. But the food was worth it. We shared 3 pizzas and a dish of pasta- we were five super hungry, sunburned and recently pizza-deprived girls. Oh and we started with a burrata and prosciutto appetizer. Everything was delicious, Wolfgang definitely knows how to make great gluten free pasta and pizza crust. Perfect amount of chewiness, even my non-gluten free friends thought it tasted like the real deal. \nWe split just a basic tomato based rigatoni pasta, but it was so good for being so simple. And then had a tomato basil, Italian meat and sausage\/broccolini pizza. I think my favorite was the the tomato basil but all three were great, I was surprised that the sausage and broccolini flavors complimented each other and totally worked. I tend to like more veggie pizza versus meat, which is why I liked the first one best but meat lovers would be more than pleased with the options here. Can't wait to come back and indulge in this pizza again the next time I'm in Vegas!
