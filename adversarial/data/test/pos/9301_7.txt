There are so many choices for Mexican food in our neighborhood.  We've passed by this place more than once and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  There is a lot of influence from New Mexico here and it's evident by the use of Hatch Chile in many of the menu items.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=jR0gwZgN7GK1O0Spel1N_g\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we ordered:\n\nHatch Chile Cheese Crisp (Fried Tortilla topped w\/melted Cheese & Hatch Chile)\n\nWhite Sands Chimichanga (Spicy Pork Green Chile covered w\/Queso Fundido)\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=Ev2eduloh_wsuBGoRq9xDQ\n\nThe Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp was pretty good, but the Tortilla wasn't cooked all the way and was still soft....not crispy as it should be.\n\nThe White Sands Chimichanga was simply awesome!  The Queso Fundido made this dish taste soooo good.\n\nThe service was pretty good.  They have craft beer on tap and I wanted to sample some before I decided....the server brought out a few tasting glasses for me to try.  I thought that was cool.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=8pgTu034N-xFslG8NGjn7w\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience.  I wasn't blown away by the food, but it is definitely worth coming back to try other items on the menu.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
