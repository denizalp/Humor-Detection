Went back to this place because it's close to where I live and tried the ribs that were on special, they were deep fried and AWFUL. Not enough enough meat on the bone, they were terrible. Like I said in my previous review this place is more of a casino than a restaurant, i'm willing to bet they make nearly all of their money on slot machines. There's plenty of loser Summerlin d-bags who drop a c-note in the machine so they can talk to some cute girl they think will might come home with them.\n\nLike I said in my previous review virtually all of the food and drink is overpriced and sub-par. BTW, the owners have sold the restaurant to one of the girls that worked here, maybe it wasn't profitable enough.\n\nI agree with \"Alex N.\" in his review where he says \"I am convinced the wait staff at this place collectively share one brain that is meticulously stored in a jar of jager behind the bar counter.\"\n\nOne of the girls that worked here sent me a message about my last review:\n\n\"I have to say reviews are opinions which are here nor there but yours was very disrespectful and hitting the fine line of slander. No employees are under the influence of drugs or alchohal or of any drug. These woman have natural personality and do not need the extra factor you so call speak of. Only one does such activities can accuse others. These women work hard, and do their best at the job. If you have a problem you should maybe not write about on the computer and actually speak to someone about it when you are there.\"\n\nI like how she couldn't spell alcohol correctly and didn't make much sense with her grammatical errors. I have actually spoke to someone about a problem here. I saw one of the patrons leave the bar intoxicated, driving dangerously fast almost hitting a man that was working outside late at night, only to swerve at the last minute to avoid hitting him. I couldn't believe what I saw so I mentioned it to the bartender inside, hinting that it's not a great idea to let patrons get so intoxicated that they could kill somebody. She said \"Maybe the guy shouldn't have been standing there\", I couldn't believe her answer.
