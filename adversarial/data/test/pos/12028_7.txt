If u find urself aimlessly walkin' on Fremont Street... after 1am-ish... and everything else (other than Gold Diggers) seems closed, what do u DO???\n\nDO go to Bar 46!\nDO get the Quality Social... this cucumber vodka drink is quite refreshing!!!\nDON'T expect for it to be cheap... you're looking at paying about $12-18 per drink.\n\nDO enjoy the outdoor patio... the couches are plush & comfy!\nDO know that there is a 2-drink\/person minimum if u r sitting on the patio area.\nDON'T forget that it's super FUN to people watch!!! ...it's amazing the things u can see while sippin' on two drinks...\n\nDO get the Ginger Riki... it's a bit sweet for my taste, but still enjoyable. \nDO get the Blossom & Herbs... DO know that this cocktail tastes like pure alcohol... and DO know that the stronger the drink... the more FUN the people watching can be!\n\nSERVICE: **** [Bartenders are a hit or miss... one nice, one not so nice.]\nAMBIANCE: **** [Nice patio, clean, decent atmosphere.]\nENTERTAINMENT: ***** [People watching on Fremont St. always = 5-stars!]\nPRICE:  $$  [$12 & up per drink.]\nOVERALL:  **** [4-stars, fun to do once a while... but not a place I would frequent.]\n\nFirst, get your alcohol fill with $2 Coronas, $2 Jagers, $3 1800 at the Fremont Casino... then head to Bar 46 for the entertainment! \n\nNuff said.
