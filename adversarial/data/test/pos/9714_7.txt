I went Thursday evening around 6 PM. The lines were long, there were a lot of people. the rides had lines almost down to the ground.\n\nI went again Friday 7 PM for the dive in movie.\nThere were sooooo many ppl  it was difficult to enjoy the experience.\n\nThe wave pool: I could not swim or ride the waves for 2 ft without bumping into somebody.\nPeople were screaming everywhere, lots of hair, debris, bugs in there.\nI even stepped on a stray swim suit bottom lol.\n\nWaves come every 5 min or so and there are about 10-20 waves each time. They come from different directions, and depending on where you're at (especially in the shallow end) you can get hit really hard.\nMy swim suit almost fell off so I suggest wearing something sturdy.\n\nA kid puked in the wave pool, thats when I exited. People still swam in there after she puked.\n\nLazy river \"cactus cooler\"...\nYou can only get on and get off in a designated area.\nThere was a line. Took a while to secure a tube (everybody is required to ride a tube in the lazy river)\nAfter one trip around the river, we all got kicked out.\nI know other people waiting in line should be given a chance, \nbut it was kind of lame from a paying customer's point of view.\n\nThe rides: I went on the red one... raging river or whatever its called.\nThe ride was kind of chill, lots of splashing. A bit cold for the night.\nThe wait was reallllly long, all the way to the ground and then more lines on the ground.\n\nI got on a turquoise-blue-green water slide. It was alright, but not a thriller.\n\nThe movie... the screen was a tiny little blow up thing erected on the side of the wave pool.\nI was kind of disappointed.\nI thought it would be on the huge wall on the deep side of the wave pool or something.\n\nThe cameras for some of the scarier rides take pix of your party,\nits around 10.99 each.\nEvery time I go either the cameras\/ system is broken so I'm guessing its not reliable.\nThe kiosk for the photos\/ lockers have almost nobody during the PM so we had to wait 5 min to get somebody to help us just to know that our ride's (raging river\/ red ride)'s camera was broken.\n\nParking is 7 bucks.\nSmall lockers are 7 bucks. They give you a bright pink RFID bracelet (waterproof)\nTube rental: one person \"O\" tube is 6 bucks and the double \"8\" tube is 12 bucks.\nThey don't let you bring your own floatie or beverages into the park. Lame.\nNo alcohol permitted either.\nThere's a line for everything: rides, food, bathroom, etc.\nOnly thing there's no line for is the wave pool which is usually pretty crowded.\n\nRide reviews:\nRed one (raging river): 3-4 person tube\/ raft ride. Not scary, pretty chill. Goes back and forth as you ride down and splashes you.\n\nGreen and blue toilet ride: \nTwo person tube\nFUN but not scary (well, maybe the initial fall for a breif moment)\nYou go down a tunnel, ride the walls of a \"toilet bowl\" round and round three times (kinda slow) and get flushed backwards into the final tunnel. They take your pix.\n\nyellow and green \"serpintine?\" water roller coaster type of deal.\nYou ride a 2 person tube\nThey make you fall steep, then shoot you up again rapidly. Go through tunnels and repeat.\nSuper fun you get splashed. But keep your butt up bc the falls hurt.\n\nRainbow slide \"desert racer\":\nNot as extreme as it looks. They give you a blue foam sled with handles on it. \nYou go face first into a tunnel.\nSome sharp turns and lots of speed.\nYou get spit out into an open slide, one moderate bump,\nif you have enough speed you'll catch some air and get Splashed in the face.\n\n\"Tornado\" ... the marigold and blue funnel\n4 person tube.\nThey send you down a dark tunnel.\nThen you see light, a SHARP fall along the edge of the funnel.\nMy stomach freaked (zero gravity free fall!).\nYou get slid up on the funnel pretty high,\nfall, and slide again,\ndo that about four times (each time less higher than the other as the funnel gets narrower)\nand get flushed out of the funnel into the hole in the back.\nThey take your photos here so make a funny face when you're riding the first fall.\n\nLazy river is a lot more chill and enjoyable when there are less ppl around, but tubes tend to clump together. since you have very little control of your speed. Grab a double tube, lay back, put a hat on your face and relax.\n\nWave pool is more fun when you go in the deep end with a tube\nNot many ppl are in the deep end so its pretty chill there and I like the thrill of my feet not touching the ground.\n\nI have a season pass, it used to be less crowded at the beginning of this month but now its way too crowded to enjoy. Bleh.
