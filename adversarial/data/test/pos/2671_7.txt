This Canadian Tire location is the greatest! I have nothing but good things to say about it (OK, they *could* stand to be open past 9pm, maybe even till 10pm? That'd make me really happy). \n\nThe staff here is exceptionally nice. When you call the store, friendly people answer. Go figure - assigning the most pleasant sounding person to man the phones instead of putting me through a voice prompt or catching my ire by forcing me to talk to someone with no phone etiquette.\n\nOnce at the store, there is an ample number of employees floating around to help you out, including the store manager, who is genuinely \"small town\" friendly and astonishingly helpful. You are prohibited from wandering around aimlessly (unless of course that's what you want to do). On a visit tonight, Giles was also particularly helpful and knew exactly where everything is located in the store.\n\nOther amenities include a cart escalator (has to be seen to be believed), washrooms and a self-serve checkout that almost always works (compared to other locations). I love coming here!\n\nNOTES: French people pronounce Canadian Tire in an extra special way. Even though there's obviously a translation for the word \"Canadian\", they overpronounce it when in reference to this store: \"Cah-na-DYEN Tye-UHRR.\" Ask me for a demo next time you see me.
