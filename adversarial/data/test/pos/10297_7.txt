Update number 2- I know this is my second up date and I'm a bad bad girl for doing so. BUT I had to let you guys know about this. I know most of you should have heard\/seen the \"new\" menu for monta, and it is now out. They have a \"spicy\" ramen and a \"black garlic\" ramen. I came here for lunch and got the tonkatsu shoyu with the black garlic oil on the side. \n \nOH MY GODS!!! Okay, I didn't use all of it because, I didn't want to over power the taste of the actual soup, but it added such a depth of flavor. For most who don't know what black garlic taste like it has a sweet, carmalized type taste and it still has a garlicy finish, it's so good and I recommend it :).
