I just moved close-by so I walked in for an eyebrow and upper lip threading ($12). The place has definitely been renovated since the last time. Things look much cleaner and more professional. Sadly, I wasn't as happy with the service this time around.\n\nThere were 3 people working when I walked in and no one greeted me. They all saw me but two just kept dealing with their customers (The place was pretty busy). The threading lady just stared at me awkwardly for a minute without saying anything, so I just sat myself down and waited. About 5 minutes in and threading lady told me just to wait there. She was with a customer only standing and talking to her, NOT actually working (the customer seemed to be done her threading already). I was sort of annoyed but I had nothing else to do so I figured I might as well wait. \n\nIn the end I waited 25 minutes for that already finished customer and another lady. Totally NOT pleased, since she spent 20 minutes just conversing with people. UGH. \n\nWhile it was my turn she was super friendly and all smiles. She was quick but careful and I was pleased with the outcome. That made things much better. \n\nOverall, I'll probably be back just because it's so convenient and cheap for me. However, I'm still expecting bad service the next time around as well.
