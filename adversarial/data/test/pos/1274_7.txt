I had a great time here. You need to know what you're getting into. If: \n- you're a delicate flower, OR\n- your idea of excitement is lawn bowling, OR \n- you expect to be warmly greeted\/ushered in by an attendant, OR\n- you bought a groupon and would never consider going otherwise: \n... chances are you will not like it.  But for the rest of us, you're in for a treat. \n\nYes, it smells (it's a bunch of gas-fueled cars in an enclosed space). Yes, the people there are rough around the edges. But you're at a go-kart track, not at the art gallery!\n\nThe price seems reasonable. After 20 laps, I was completely worn out (in a good way!). The cars are really fast, and it's tricky riding the corners at higher speeds. \n\nYeah, outdoor tracks are bigger, but this was a real blast. And it's indoors, so you're sheltered from the elements. Looking forward to going again next week for my friend's birthday.
