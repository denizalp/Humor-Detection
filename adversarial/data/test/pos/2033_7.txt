I love anything that's free! The orbit picks up right in front of my house and goes down to Mill Ave and all over Tempe. It runs every 15 minutes which is super convenient. I've never had to wait longer than that too which is nice. My one complaint is that it stops running too early on the weekends. They would save a lot of college kids DUI's if they would run until the bars close. Hey, I would take it!
