Sunday, March 6th, 2016 I visited this location. The hostess seated me and my friend in a booth designed for 4 or more people.  There were many tables open as the place was not busy.  I am a large guy at 265 pounds.  Anyone could see this was not a comfortable seat for me.  The hostess seemed to care less.  Not offering a table. I think this was very rude.\nThe waiter:  Well the waiter was mediocre, asking me if I wanted protein in my rice.  WTF, protein.  What was he going to do to my rice?  One can only imagine.  lol\nThe decor of the place is awesome!  I love the atmosphere, but lets train the employees a little better.
