**Take out Review**\nI hate to go against the grain, but I really enjoyed The Noodle Shop. My husband and I were in need for some comfort food, and for us, that's noodles. We ordered pad thai and Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles and Seafood to go. The staff was helpful and kind, they kept it short and sweet so that we could be on our way. We had to go take care of some business with the concierge and when we got back, our order was waiting for us. \nWe took it up to the room and enjoyed our noodles and TV (as God intended). The pad Thai was fantastic, and I am fully aware that it could be because I was starving, but either way, I enjoyed it very much. Mr. R. finished his dish and even had some of mine. I appreciate the Noodle Shop for being different from the other casual fare offered at Mandalay Bay, sometimes you have to take less than desirable noodles in order to get noodles at all.
