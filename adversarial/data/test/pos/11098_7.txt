For the longest time, two places have sat at the top fo my Vegas To Try list - CraftSteak...and Pink's.  Yep, I know.  Quite possibly the only time those two will ever be #1 and #2 on the same list.  For anything.  Ever.\n\nUnlike Earl of Sandwich, which had its usual, ridiculous line going on, nary a person could be found at the at counter at Pink's.  Perfect for us since we just wanted a quick lunch before our flight...and because we probably took 10 minutes to figure out what to get from their giant menu board (it took me so long, I swear they all started to sound the same...).  Although it wasn't one of the sexier options, I ordered the POLISH PASTRAMI SWISS CHEESE DOG ($8.49), and tried some for the CHILI CHEESE FRIES ($6.79) that my friend had ordered for our group to share.  \n\nTopped with Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, and Mustard (forgot to add on the Sour Kraut), the polish wasn't bad but hardly exciting (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#2Cd3mM114U75Fre4_Z9ong).  While the Polish sausage itself was fine (who knew it went so well with Swiss cheese?), the shreds of pastrami were really dry and a bit salty.  The Chili Cheese Fries were guiltfully tasty though (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#ZCy7uTuIMph17rZSk5TtgA).  Not so much for the cheese sauce (because it's, you know, cheese sauce), but because their chili is surprisingly decent!  Plus...who doesn't love some good chili fries?\n\nAll in all, I'd come back if I needed something relatively quick and simple, as well as to try some of the more unique and \"exotic\" combinations (stomach ache on a plane?  Ummm...no).  Pink's is probably one of the better bets around based on convenience alone, but at about $8 a pop, they do an even better job of making me appreciate Costco's $1.50 Polish and a drink that much more.
