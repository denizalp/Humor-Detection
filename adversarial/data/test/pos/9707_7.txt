Blah, blah, blah, it's a Giant Eagle, and there are already approximately three million Giant Eagles in the Cleveland metropolitan area. But this one is slightly different: it has a liquor store inside of it. \n\nThat's right, hidden behind the 10-foot-tall stacks of Full Moon Winter Ale, there's a little store-within-a-store hidden to serve all of your full-alcohol needs. \n\nApparently Giant Eagle has been paying attention to folks like myself, who until now have had to go separate places for 1) Hungry-Man meals, and 2) gin. Oh, wait, they have Lean Pockets here! Great, now I can eat healthy.
