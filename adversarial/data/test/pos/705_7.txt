If you're in a ball-hitting mood, come to Casey at the Bat. You can hit all the balls you could possibly dream of and you can choose the speed that they're thrown at even.\n\nIf you're a hockey fan, you can play roller hockey in their rink and they have video games inside.\n\nI give it only three stars because I just really don't think it's all that fun. I mean, after awhile, hitting a bunch of balls gets old, right? RIGHT?\nWell, it does for me.\n\nAnd they just haven't really kept up the place that well. It's sorta dingy.  But other than that, if you're looking for something a little different to do, Casey's is not a bad choice. The balls are waiting for you. \n\n**Warning**this is a high school hangout!
