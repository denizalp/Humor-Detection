I called this salon on a Friday afternoon and they were able to get me in for a cut and color Saturday. Renee texted me Friday and was willing to work late Friday night but We agreed on Saturday. She is the nicest person ever!  She makes her job look easy. She is excellent at what she does. I felt comfortable talking to her and she was careful making sure each step was what I wanted. My hair was a mess (I decided to try and cut it myself) and she brought it back to life. I didn't think someone could pull it off without cutting my hair up to my ears but Renee cut it and it's still past my shoulders!  She is awesome and I am so happy I found someone! I am picky and get nervous when it comes to my hair. I've been looking around for years at salons nearby and I have had no luck.  I will follow Renee wherever she goes...as long as she lets me :) I am def one happy client!  Ask for Renee.  She will not disappoint...
