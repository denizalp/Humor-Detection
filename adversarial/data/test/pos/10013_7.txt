Someone's got some catching up to do - this is certainly no Mercatto on Toronto Street (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/mercatto-toronto#hrid:BfmxobTP-54pUWJpReGw9w). \n\nOur server either didn't know how OR didn't have the upper body strength to properly grate parmagiano reggiano, which was a little awkward. \n\nMenu is different from location to location and a bit more limited here than at the Toronto restaurant. I ordered the Ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs with brown butter sage ($14). I saw evidence of sage on my plate but other than that this dish wasn't at all flavourful, and I wouldn't order it again or urge anyone else to. My Italian bf makes it better.\n\nDecor is very beautiful and vibrant; from the outside you'd be tempted to walk in blindly based on how fun the atmosphere looks. I noticed there were specials on a chalkboard after I had already ordered - information that our server certainly should have shared with us? A shame because they all looked much more enticing to me than what I saw on the regular menu.
