I'll be honest that I was skeptical about this place. There's this \"western\" feeling about this place. And by that, I mean it's more catered to \"western\" palettes. Usually those places are a hit and miss, usually a miss. But I was actually surprised about this place. I would have never ever thought to have come here ever. So I have to thank my friend for choosing this place since she said it was good. They have really good looking sushi menu and a variety of rolls to choose from. Originally we came for sushi but ended up getting teppanyaki. I ordered the chicken because I wanted to take a break from red meat after going BACK2BACK like Drake at Gen KBBQ. My friend ordered the steak and honestly it was so good. I just had 1 bite and it was super tender. More tender and delicious than Benihana. Made me reevaluate my choice of protein for a second there. But that doesn't mean the chicken\/ shrimp weren't good. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Our chef was engaging and really nice. He did a great job at presenting on the grill. I'll warn you to keep your plates free cause he gonna light that on fire like Travis Scott. It's a bit of a drive from me but honestly it's not bad at all. I was surprised! You may be lowkey still hungry afterwards tho, but that's just me ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯
