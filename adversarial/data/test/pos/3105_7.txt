Stopped here for a late night snack last night and was pretty happy with my experience! The atmosphere was nice, I liked the wooden walls and the neat bar area. We got to sit wherever and had really good service. Like the quickest service we have ever had. We were in and out of there in 25 minutes, it was incredible ha! We ordered pretzels with beer cheese and also a hummus plate. Both were delicious. Also both were $2 cheaper than listed on the menu which was a nice surprise, idk if they do reverse happy hour or something? The food was delicious except the carrots served with our hummus were nasty, all dried up and white. Hummus was not my fave but I did like it. The pretzels and beer cheese were delightful, the cheese had just a bit of spice, perfect! Good amount of food for $15, I'd come back.
