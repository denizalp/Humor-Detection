I brought my niece here yesterday.  She loves good food so clearly she takes after me.  We arrived around 2 p.m. on a Tuesday so I did not expect a line up but indeed there was one.  I decided to wait none the less.\n\nIt was worth the drive and the wait.  Congee with pork and the weird looking black eggs, fried radish cake, vegetarian rice rolls, soft tofu in sweet syrup, crispy deep fried wontons, spare ribs that look juicy and greasy but not too greasy.  My niece wondered what the green chopsticks in the middle of the table were for, it's there for a more sanitary dim sum experience!  Bring the food to your plate with the green chopsticks. \n\nMany dim sum places lack vegetarian options, not this one.  That's why I brave the lines and keep going back.  Oh yes, and the price is $1.90 per item after 2 p.m. on weekdays.  I can eat like a queen at those prices.
