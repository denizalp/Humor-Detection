I wish I could have given this restaurant a higher rating than what other Yelp guest are suggesting, however the service was lacking and the food wasn't the best.  Here are a few examples:\n\nA) Drinks - I ordered a red Sangria and although it came out as a somewhat Sangria, it was overly full of a lot of carbonation.  It was almost too disgusting to drink.  How can you mess up Sangria in an Italian restaurant?\n\nB) Meatballs - Ordered this as an appetizer and it was full of garlic...wayyyy too much.  I suffered from major heartburn from this later.\n\nC) Salads - Only have one dressing and wouldn't take other request or have other dressings.\n\nD) Lasagna - Too much oil and grease, also contributed to the heartburn.  Also contained too many onions.\n\nOverall, I don't think I will be back.  I'll stick to Olive Garden or a place that can serve true Italian food.  Was not happy about the service nor the food.  Waited a long time in the bar area for someone to take my order.  See attached picture!
