First off I was approved for an apartment weeks ago. Then they gave the apartment to another person. Why? Because they can not read. I was contacted and told I would have to pay a double deposit?? They said I owed another apartment $461.00. I actually did not owe and it was paid. They didn't finish reading that it had been paid. This all happened in one day. I could not get anyone to return my calls. \n\nI had a $461.00 fee when I deployed to Iraq, I had a two week notice. This fee was paid while I was deployed. \n\nDo not go with these people. Very unprofessional.
