I used to go to this place to get oil changes for my vehicle, advertised for $19.99 plus tax. Service Advisor at this location told me after service that I required a new oil pan, that mine was cracked, rotting and quoted me at $200.00. For a 5-year old car to have a rotting oil pan, I sought a second opinion from an independent mechanic who told me my oil pan was fine and that I instead needed a new drain plug. Cost to replace wait for it... $5.00!!\n\nFront brakes were also quoted at $120 more than my independent shop for the same exact work. Shut 'em down, poor training is not an excuse. Ripping off clients is a conscious effort to defraud consumers. Sticking to my independent mechanic I trust and I'll never look back.
