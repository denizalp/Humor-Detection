Very frustrating.\nWhile trying to make last minute plans on Valentines dinner, we ended up at this place wanting to try something different. I guess this is what my punishment is for being indecisive. \n\nFirst strike was the waitress unnecessarily bending over while greeting us so we could get a good look at her boobs. I guess thats how she makes her tips 'cuz her service is terrible. I wouldn't have minded the boobs so much if I wasn't with my wife on Valentines day!!\n\nNext was the wait. After we told the waitress that we needed another second to make our selections she spent 10 minutes at the table next to us (of all guys) flirting and giving them the extended boob show while we wondered if we should just leave. We should have.\n\nOnce we ordered, the food took no more than five minutes which was nice after waiting forever to order. But i'm not a fan of places that have everything pre-cooked sitting on a steam table waiting for me to order it. Unless it's a Chinese food Buffet, then I'm game!\n\nAll would have been forgiven if the food was good. Actually the beans and Mac n Cheese were excellent, but the only good thing about the chicken and the ribs was the sauce on top of it. \nWhen my wife asked for different sides because they were terrible, she got an awkward interrogation as if she was trying to steal something.\n\nLong story short, next time when I feel like some crappy food and some boobs in my face, I'll just go to the Candy Store!
