Valerie is very accommodating and friendly.  Facial was going great until Valerie wiped my face with a cotton ball that had this anti-bacterial solution on it and boy did my face burn.  Valerie fanned my face and wiped it again with another solution to soothe it.  The burn was not tolerable.  My skin on my face continued to peel a week after the day I had the facial.  Not cool. I would appreciate it if Valerie had mentioned the possibility of me shedding like a snake or something because I had started work the week that my face was peeling...and not from a peel but an anti-bacterial solution!
