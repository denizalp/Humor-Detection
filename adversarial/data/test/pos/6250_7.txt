On December 11, 2015, came in around 5:45 a.m. to workout.  Haven't been to this facility in the morning during a weekday for awhile.  Upon completion of my workout, went to the locker and realized I forgot my towel to shower.  The lady next to me saw my reaction and advised me to go to the front desk to ask for one because she forgot her towel before and they gave her one.  I did.  I was told by the female receptionist I couldn't have one because it's policy since I didn't have the towel service.  I told her I knew about the policy, but it was only this one time I needed one and that I was running late for work.  She kept saying no and that she would have to ask her manager.  I agreed.  She came back saying the manager said I could have one if I paid $4.00 for one towel.  I was hesitant and at the same time desperate.  I told her that I will give her the money when I'm done showering and changing.  She didn't agree.  After a few more attempts in asking, the receptionist said no.  At the same time, an elderly lady who I used to see in the mornings saw what was going on and she told me she forgot her towel before and they gave her one.  I ran to the locker, gathered my things and left.  As I was walking out, a male member asked if I was okay and I told him what was going on and he said that they gave him a towel when he forgot his.  I could make this a race issue, but I'm not.\n\nI've been a member of this gym on and off for at least five years.  I initially signed up for two years and didn't renew after since I was using my company gym \"with towels\".  Then last year, LVAC had a special and I paid for the next two years.  Given all that, LVAC couldn't even make a concession to lend me one, not two or three, but one towel just this one time.  Just one time.  \n\nTo the manager and receptionist working on December 11, 2015 in the early morning between 6 a.m. to 7 a.m., that was so messed up.  I only needed one towel just this one time.
