After hearing about Denny's attempt to persuade people to ingest the culinary abomination they call the \"Grand Slam\" by giving them away, I realized that I don't want to eat bad food, ever, even if it is free.  This is not to say that I will only eat crepes suzette prepared by a Cordon Bleu chef.   Far from it.  I appreciate a beautifully executed burger as well as a perfectly seared foie gras.\n\nSo I headed to PJ's Luncheonette for a real, delicious diner breakfast.  $4.50 gets you: two increadibly fresh eggs, prepared right in front of you, any way you like; three strips of crispy bacon, pressed flat to ensure maximum crispitudiousness; hashbrowns with carmelized edges, without a hint of greasiness; two slices of toast ;and great, hot, fresh coffee.\n\nPJ's is fabulous.  It's the kind of place where your Gramps used to take you for a patty melt.  And yes, they still serve them!   It is scrupulously clean.  The waitresses are old school awesome.  They still call you \"honey\".  The food is just as good as when Gramps went there-- fresh, simple, inexpensive Americana.\n\nDenny's could never come close.
