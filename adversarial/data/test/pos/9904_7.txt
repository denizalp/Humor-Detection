I love both the food here and the super friendly owners that run this happy restaurant. Came here by accident when one of my other restaurants was closed for the day and decided to try them out.\n\nThey have a small but unique menu with all sorts of different flavors to explore. Really like the homemade noodles along with their tasty hot sauce. Definitely gives the meal a little kick without going overboard.\n\nSome of my favorites are the Szechuan Dandan Noodles, Chuanbei Hot and Sour Bean Noodles, the many types of Gyozas, and the Jalapeno Pork. Can't wait to try out something else.\n\nCan be a small language barrier when ordering. Just take your time and order by number to make it easier. She is very helpful but sometimes makes me giggle a bit. They also have pictures of several dishes on the wall to help you make your selection.\n\nLocated inside the food court area in Mekong Plaza with a seating area that is shared with other restaurants. This is a very no frills eating area but worth checking out and an inexpensive way to enjoy some tasty vittles. NICE!
