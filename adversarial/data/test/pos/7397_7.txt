I've had Lola's on my radar for a while, but I've never been a huge fan of Cajun food. I decided to give in and come here for a post Christmas celebration with my OG.\n\nWe walked in and we were seated quickly. Everything looked pretty good but I decided on the bronzed shrimp and grits and my friend ordered the jambalaya with added shrimp.\n\nMy dish was great. The grits were nice and cheesy and the shrimp had a great kick. Very spicy. My friend enjoyed his dish quite a bit and said his was incredibly spicy too, in a positive way.\n\nService was attentive and friendly. Luckily they were very good about keeping the refills coming, it was definitely appreciated with the spice levels they serve.
