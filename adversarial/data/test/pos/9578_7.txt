I don't normally write reviews about fast food joints... In fact, I don't normally EAT at fast food joints. \n\nI pulled into the drive-thru for a quick chicken sandwich before a movie. I ordered my food, nothing crazy, just a crispy chicken sandwich with a little ranch added. I pulled up behind a car at the second window and then WAITED FOR TEN MINUTES. I know that isn't a huge amount of time, but what the hell were they doing in there? It's McDonald's! It's supposed to be super fast! When I finally got to the window, it was then another almost five minute wait. I asked the guy what was going on and said \"there was a mixup with my food\". Huh? You mean my lonely little chicken sandwich with ranch and pickles? Jeez, sorry to confuse you all!\n\nWell, i finally got it, with like 5 minutes to spare before my movie. There was barely any ranch on it and it was cold. Blech.\n\nThis just reinforces why I never eat at crappy places like this. I guess it's my own fault.
