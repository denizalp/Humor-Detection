Dragon's Alley is located in the Lucky Dragon Casino which is behind the Bonanza gift shop on Las Vegas Blvd. It resembles a buffet but everything is a la cart like a cafeteria. The pricing isn't listed ...I also tried asking but the server didn't quite understand so I just waited until we got to the register. A order of Chow Mein, fried rice, a beef dish, chicken and two drinks cost about $23.00.\n\nThe beef really stood out for me the flavor and the tenderness were fantastic but a little fatty. It would have been perfect with steamed rice but I only saw fried rice. The rice and the chow mein tasted fine but it wasn't extraordinary. I'm typically afraid to order chicken because it's either smelly, tough or too dry. This chicken was tasty but be careful of the tiny bones.\n\nThe seating area is cool with the column of bicycles, lanterns and red chairs. The staff comes around and asks if you need anything from take out boxes to refills. It's a nice experience to go at least one time but I would go again just to have the beef and chicken again.
