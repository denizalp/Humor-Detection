It was a little easy to overlook, but distinctly classy, even compared to the rest of CityScape's watering holes. We stepped in and waited...and waited...staff looked at us and kept walking, as if we weren't hip enough to breathe the air in such an establishment. \n\nDon't make eye contact with customers who have just entered and then walk away. That's customer service you should have picked up at whatever previous jobs allowed you to land here. \n\n\"Maybe it's closing\", I muttered, looking at the hours posted on Yelp. \"They're still douchebags here.\"\n\nJust before we were about to leave, your mustachioed mixologist from Michoacan swooped in to completely redeem this trendy bar. I am a gin man, not a whiskey guy, so I was totally lost regarding what to order. Good thing this is a bartender I can trust, I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of the \"Ours is the fury\" (strange name) that he recommended for my sweet tooth. I would have certainly tried more, but be careful! These are strong! It was a Monday night, and I had stuff to do in the morning.\n\nBut I'll be back, and I'm going to try several styles of whiskey. And recommend this place to my more manly, whiskey-loving friends. I find myself going out for a cocktail quite often nowadays. Between quality liquor and woody, classy decor, Blue hound totally deserves to see more of my business.\n\nOh, and there's food, too. I'll update you when I give that a try as well.
