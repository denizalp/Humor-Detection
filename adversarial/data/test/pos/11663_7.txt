Came to St. Lawrence market place looking for breakfast after having just landed and of course, being a tourist made me look over at the crowd that is Carousel Bakery. If everyone is getting a peameal breakfast sammie, then that's what i'm getting too! \n\nHaving no idea what it is, I still wanted to try. Turns out, it was a pure bacon sandwich. Thick slices of bacon between 2 pieces of bread. That is literally it.\n\nI ended up splitting it, and I'm glad I did because the bacon was really salty. The sandwich was really one dimensional in the sense that it didn't have any sauce or anything, just bread and meat. It was pretty good overall, but I would probably split one and eat something else on the side since it's pretty heavy.
