I hate this club. I don't get why everyone HAS to come here. Like really? Come on now. The crowd here is weak. And the hip hop room is the size of a garage! What the hay?? It's just a big no no for me. I never have fun here... hands down one of the worst clubs in Vegas. I hate that my friends drag me here, UGH!!!!!!
