Sprinkles is well known as one of the OG Gourmet Cupcakeries, and the first to sell cupcakes via an ATM. As someone with a huge sweet tooth and a fondness for cupcakes, I was excited when Sprinkles opened their first Las Vegas location at the Linq promenade. Sadly that excitement was pretty short lived. \n\nAfter 4 visits, I can safely say that the cupcakes are just average. Nothing special about them,  they aren't bad but for the price I expect a more moist and flavorful cake. I do love the frosting on the Salted Caramel cupcake though.  For me, it's all about the Cap'n Crunch ice cream. It is the only thing at Sprinkles I actually crave, and can not find elsewhere. Sadly I can't even say that Sprinkles does ice cream well, as my husband got a scoop of strawberry and it tasted freezer burnt and ended up in the trash. \n\nService has always been friendly at Sprinkles but I do think the entire ordering process could be streamlined to go quicker. Having separate areas for ordering cupcakes and ice cream is a good idea in theory, but when the ice cream area is packed and there are more employees than customers on the cupcake side that should indicate to management that staffing is off. \n\nWhen I am at Linq, chances are I will stop into Sprinkles for some Cap'n Crunch ice cream, but it isn't a place I'd drive across town specifically to go to.
