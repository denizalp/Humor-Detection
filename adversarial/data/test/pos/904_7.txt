Monte Carlo buffet isn't bad per se it's simply that other buffets are so much better for what you get \/ pay. The selection is\\\\was fairly small, the food was OK, no 1 food item really stands out in my mind... cept the watermelon, that was juicy and sweey - but it's pretty sad when you remember something as pedestrian as watermelon at a buffet, ya know?\n\nI say scope out Wynn, Bellagio, Paris, RIo and et cetera... much much better.
