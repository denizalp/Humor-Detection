First time eating soul food... my fabulous boss brought me here for a lunch meeting. Needless to say, the \"meeting\" went out the window and we just chowed down for a good hour. Red beans over rice, mac n cheese, cornbread, catfish... I felt like I was in the movie, Soul Food (can I be Nia Long for a day?) \n\nFive stars based on food only. Service wasn't great... girl at the counter had an attitude problem, or maybe just had a bad day - but no excuses for trying to mess up my experience! Go here anyway!
