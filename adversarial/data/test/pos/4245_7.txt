Okay so the pool is cool. The stage is sweet. And there is room to dance around like a crazy person. \nThree Stars BECAUSE there is like ONE fucking bar and it takes FOREVER to get a damn drink!!!!!! Completely ridiculous! \nThey did have a good deal on Pool Cups though... First one is $40 and then refills were $20 - if you can ever get to the front of the bar again!!!!
