Contemporary art is usually above my pay grade and the MOCA was no exception. Still, I opted in, figuring that I might learn something.\n\nThis is a non-collecting museum, meaning that the exhibits are here now and gone later. They don't keep any of it. When the exhibit is done, it moves on.\n\nThe two exhibits on the lower floors? I didn't understand them at all. That's normal. The one on the top floor, though. I found that interesting. It's a history of Mark Mothersbaugh, who was one of the key founders of the band DEVO. Lots of memorabilia and history from his life, the early recordings and performances of the band and some more recent stuff. With the Rock Hall here in Cleveland, this was particularly timely.\n\nVery interesting and because it's a changing exhibit, worth returning.
