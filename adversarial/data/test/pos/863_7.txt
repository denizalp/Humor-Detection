I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 simply because my kid had fun. It's fairly blah, but he had a good time, left with a smile on his face, and the value was excellent.\n\nIt's a semi-dingy, indoor kid amusement park. We went on a weekday when I played hooky because my son had a vacation day from pre-school. We had originally planned to try Makutu's Island but they don't open til 2 pm on weekdays. (2?? Reeeeallly?) Jeeper's was pretty close and opened at 11, so we went there instead. (another in a long list of thank you's to Google and my G1 phone for an emergency search)\n\nAnyway, the price is definitely right at Jeeper's, especially on weekdays. It was only $5 for an all-you-can-ride wristband for my son, and no charge for the adults. (not that I'm squeezing my butt into one of those little flying spaceships anyway...) He's only 2.9 (3 in 3 weeks), so the rides were perfect for him. And I got to ride on a couple with him, so we had a nice daddy and son day of fun.\n\nThere's also a large climbing area (like the McDonald's jungle gym on steroids) with some fun slides and whatnot.\n\nAll in all, not bad, a good deal money-wise, and a smile on my kid's face. For $5, who wouldn't jump on that deal??
