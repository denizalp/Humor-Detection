Finally got around to trying out the new Diamond. Monday evening 7pm, less than 10 min wait, hurrah. Seated in corner, kind of weird spot, whatevs, I was starved. Friendly waitress was quick and took our orders promptly. Got my go to, the soy veggie dog. It was just as delicious as I remembered it to be. I can be happy again. \n\nBar is nice and wonderful to grab a quick, cheap beer before having to run off, to the next bar or from whoever's chasing you.\n\nExpanded menu includes all our old favorites plus a couple extras, everything looks delicious. Will have to bring stretchy pants next time.
