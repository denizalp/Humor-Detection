I love the Cuppa! Finally one near my house and it's open later than all the other Cuppas. It's located near lush in Downtown Summerlin. The interior is spacious and there is lots of seating. I do wish they had more outlets, but there are a few scattered around. They also have a large patio with comfy seating. \n\nThe service is impeccable. Everyone is super friendly and familiar with the menu. They offer different kinds of milks and syrups as well. They also offer a lot of really great teas! I had one of the baristas create an earl grey tea latte that was out of this world. Their matcha green tea latte is NOT vegan. I was misinformed from an employee who thought it was just a matcha powder. It in fact is not. \n\nThis place is convenient to study at... and another huge perk is it's located near tru fusion! Coffee and yoga anyone?
