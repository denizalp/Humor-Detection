Came by for dinner the other night and it was also a mediocre experience. \n\nStarted off with the bone marrow which was ok. The bone marrow itself wasn't fatty as I was expecting and it was quite salty...despite being served with a side of sea salt.. \n\nMoved on to the eye of the rib steak requested medium rare and came out as such. It was quite lean and wasn't a ribeye that I was looking for...\n\nThe side of roasted brussel sprouts were surprisingly too sweet...they would have been tastier if they were less sweet...\n\nStaff was super friendly!
