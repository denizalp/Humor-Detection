I thought I'd give this place a try twice before writing a review.  The first visit was within a couple of weeks after the grand opening.  The waitress was no where to be found when needed and I had to request my check at least 3 times.  In addition, there must have been an issue with the cushions in our seating area which triggered \"Peter\" asking everyone to stand so he could fluff the cushions(Total turn-off).  My last and final attempt to patron this restaurant was last Saturday.  This time the staff was attentive but my meal was  poorly prepared.  I've never eaten shrimp and grits in which I had to pull the tail off the shrimp.  In addition the grits were quite stiff and bland.  I didn't complain at that moment but I was definitely not pleased.  This dish certainly needs to be revamped.
