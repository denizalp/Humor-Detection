Like other reviews stated, it is not the cardio room but it is on the Spa side. Although it was advertised as opening at 6am, there were a few mornings they opened early just for me since I was standing in the doorway looking helpless lol ( thank you) It really is a nice spot with enough weights as long as it is not crowded. They have a few machines as well for you to use if needed. I was in there to use all the weights they had after running on the strip. I think I surprised a few people by telling them that as they looked at me like I a deer in headlights. At any rate, I will definitely be using this spot again when I come back to Vegas for work.
