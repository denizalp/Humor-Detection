If I was to give Firenze apartments any stars, I would be giving them negative stars for their incompetent staff and insect-infested apartments. Don't be fooled by their newly renovated club house, sweet front desk ladies, and \"clean\" apartments on your tour here. This is not a good depiction of how you will live for the duration of your stay if you decide to sign your contract. When they first quote you, they will try to ask more money from you by stating that you will have to pay more because you didn't sign the lease before 1pm the same day you received the quote. If you haggle them enough, they will give you the amount they quoted you for but it will require a little bit of effort on your part. I've been drafting up this review over the last year while living at Firenze and here are my reasons for why you SHOULD NOT rent from this apartment complex:\n\n1.When I first toured my apartment complex, Melissa said that she would do a thorough sweep through of my apartment because she had noticed a couple dirty spots--dead bugs on the window seal, dirt on the walls, leftover dried-up laundry detergent stains on the racks above the laundry machines, and leftover trash piled up beside the laundry machines. When I moved in, it was in the same condition in which I toured. I called maintenance and all they did was send maintenance with a towel and spray bottle to my door. He asked me to point out the spots and wiped the dirty spots with his dirty rag. He smeared the dirt across all surfaces making it more obvious than before. I had to send him away because he was making more of a mess than he was cleaning. Firenze charges a $300 non-refundable deposit for cleaning, but there was not much cleaning that was done unfortunately. DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!\n\n2. My apartment came without a towel rack. I visited my friend's apartment which was a mirror floor plan of mine and her bathroom included a towel rack, so I kindly placed a work order with the front desk for a towel rack. The lady said that it wasn't a problem and that it would be installed within 2-3 business days. One week passes by and I inquire about the status of my work order. The lady reassures me that the work order is still in the system and that the towel rack is backordered. One month passes by and still no towel rack...I call the front desk and they said that my work order was cancelled and asked me if I had a towel rack in my apartment. My frustration was building up at this point. I told them I was still without a towel rack and Melissa ensures me that she will have one installed that very morning -_____- They had a towel rack in stock all along...If you want to get anything accomplished around here, you will need a lot patience and effort. The towel rack was finally installed, but they had put it up at eye level. Never have I seen a towel rack that high before! And when they finished their job, they forgot to turn off all the lights in my apartment. DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!\n\n3. They do not take do care of the community property. Trees grow fast and dip so low that they hit you in the face when you're walking. Trash is always overflowing out of the dumpsters with a peculiar, foul odor that follows you into your apartment. DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!\n\n4. This place is ridden with cockroaches. My friend and I were both greeted with these tiny creatures our very first week here. They do offer pest control who come in on Mondays to spray down your apartment. The cockroaches still find their way in whether its through the door, hole in the wall, or through the sink. Watch out for these little creatures, they'll creep up on you! DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!\n\n5. The front gates are open during business hours so anyone can enter into the community. I once had a homeless come in knocking on my door asking for water and any change I had. Would you feel safe? I certainly didn't. DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!\n\nDo yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere. These people are money hungry and won't care about your well-being. They won't care if your car got broken into. They won't care if your unit gets robbed. Hell, they won't even care if the amenities in your apartment aren't working.
