Once again, rude service 'greets' customers. The guys behind the meat\/ cheese counter seldom, if ever, smile and make a customer feel welcome.\n\nThe spirit of the the original people from Faeto, Italy who created this store is loooong gone. My grandparents would be appalled by the arrogance and nasty attitudes.\n\nMeanwhile, I'll be going to Alescis. Better service, and, you'll find things Galluci's doesn't have.
