I don't think this place is better than Mastro's but the service is excellent.\n\nFor some reason when my friends and I go to Vegas, we always get something for free at a dining place...last time it was Bouchon, this time it was Brand Steakhouse.\n\nWe had reservations at 9pm, which we noted at the end of dinner that the kitchen closes at 10pm (and the bar is open till 2am). When we got there we all ordered the rib-eye, and the kitchen ran out of and asked if we could switch out our steaks to maybe porterhouse or the NY strips. We were really disappointed because our friends come here all the time and swears on their rib-eye. We say okay and the restaurant apologizes and promises to send us free dessert.\n\nNext, my friends who order a porterhouse medium rare and a medium get it both well done. Disappointed, they asked the waiter if they could get another steak, and the restaurant happily comps them 3 free steaks for the mistake (and the previous mistake of not having enough rib-eyes for our group).\n\nThe steaks itself and the sides (macaroni, spinach, etc.) were all good but not comparable to Mastro's. I was happy that the restaurant honors itself of being a fine dining restaurant by comping us with free dessert (enough to feed a group of 10+ with barely any leftovers) and comping us 3 free steaks. But if you're a steakhouse, you shouldn't run out of steaks, and shouldn't have overcooked in the first place, but it wasn't comparable to mastro's, so I give it 3 stars.
