Oh CLE Clothing, how I love you. Let me count the ways:\n1. These aren't your grandma's souvenir shirts. These are badass, beautiful, creative works of art. So much so, I hang them on my wall as if they were pieces of art. (I'm not kidding.)\n\n2. They are constantly coming out with new and improved designs. I come in here at least once a month and there is always something new to see (and buy, though my wallet wishes otherwise).\n\n3. The staff is always on point. They are super welcoming and friendly. Huge plus in my book.\n\n4. Location. I will gladly make going to CLE Clothing into a day-long adventure since there is so much to do in the surrounding are. I mean hello: E. 4th!\n\n5. The prices are incredibly reasonable for the product you get. High-quality, well-designed Cleveland swag is nothing to phone-in.
