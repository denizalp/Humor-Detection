Even though I was here months ago, Cornish Pasty is one of those places I just can't seem to get out of my head.  I find myself craving their mouthwatering pasties often, usually after a few drinks and especially after midnight.  \n\nWhat drew me to try this place was that they have an ENTIRE vegan and vegetarian section of pasties!!!!  No annoying requests for modifications, no screw ups, no explaining that egg is not vegan and chicken is not vegetarian.  It's all right there on the menu for me to peruse and enjoy!\n\nWith so many options, it took a little while for me and my husband to decide what to choose.  He eats meat but is a good sharer so we decided to try one vegan pasty and one vegetarian one.  We ordered draft beers from their solid beer menu filled with good craft selections and had a chance to take in the atmosphere.  This place is pretty casual, dimly lit, homey, and it does indeed feel like you're in an English pub.  People seemed to be having a good time, and our server was friendly and helpful.  \n\nWith beers in hand, we finally decided to get a vegan southwestern pasty and a vegetarian rosemary chicken pasty.  FYI, the menu states that there are always at least two vegan pasties available at any given time.  The options rotate and aren't listed on the menu so you have to ask.  \n\nWhen our server brought out our order, I couldn't believe how enormous and amazing these pasties looked!  The crust on the vegan pasty was slightly lighter in color and not as golden as the vegetarian one.  I'm guessing they make the normal pasty crust with lots of butter and brush them with egg before baking.  Both were oozing with gooey cheese and plump with tons of filling.  The vegan southwestern pasty was stuffed with Daiya cheddar cheese, black beans, roasted poblano peppers, squash, and other veggies.  It was so freaking good!  The filling components worked amazingly well together, and the flaky crust was the perfect addition to add some crunch and texture.  This pasty was rich and decadent without being oily or heavy.\n\nThe vegetarian rosemary chicken pasty was oozing with brie cheese, Quorn chicken (made with egg so not vegan), potatoes, red bell peppers, and seasoned with rosemary.  The pastry portion was golden, buttery, and flaky, and quite rich.  This pasty came with a creamy dijon sauce that worked really well to add sharpness to every bite.  While this choice was was a bit rich for me, it was incredibly good and flavorful.  And I loved the addition of mock meat to this option.  So many non-veg places leave us vegetarians and vegans with limited options of only  veggies and\/or cheese, not realizing that many of us enjoy hearty, protein-packed options.  Not true!  If I'm going to eat a pasty, I want the full experience -- mock meat and all!  While I like Quorn, a vegan mock meat like Beyond Meat or Gardein would be even better as it would open up more possibilities for addition to the amazing vegan pasties.\n\nCornish Pasty has now moved up to my #1 must visit spot in Vegas.  Hell, next time I'm going to bring some home with me to satisfy those midnight cravings!
