Came here with my boyfriend on a weekday around 6pm. The restaurant was empty so we got to choose where we wanted to sit. We had a great time. The waitress was helpful and super polite!\n\nMy boyfriend and I both tried the chicken wraps with fries. He is pretty picky when it comes to trying new foods so I was surprised when he loved the meal...he loved it so much that he ate half my wrap too lol\n\nWe finished off with some hooka. They offer three flavors (double apple, grape and grape mint). It was pretty good. \n\nWill definitely be eating here again in the near future :)
