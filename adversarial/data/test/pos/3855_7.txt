It's alright. I had the treasures in the garden, which was basically stir fry veggies but the names sounds way better. Overall, it was fine but a bit too salty. My friend had the pho but the noodles were a bit chewy and the broth was a touch under seasoned. I would go back and give it another try. The server was very friendly though.
