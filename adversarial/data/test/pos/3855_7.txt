I hadn't been to an Islands Restaurant since moving away from the Los Angeles area and hadn't had much interest in returning.\n\nMy friend was in town with her young daughter so we had to find a kid-friendly restaurant near my work for our lunch meeting. Service was friendly and helpful and we appreciated how attentive they were with refills. The food was just ok and for the price I see no need to return when there are so many better non-chain options that serve better food for the price.
