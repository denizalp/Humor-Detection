I'm a Green Valley Range regular, I'd say we go probably two to three times a month. Today was my least favorite visit - but, to be fair for all the other times I'll start off with what makes me continue going back. \n\n1) The prices are extremely fair\n2) The range offers complimentary targets \n3) Most staff is extremely friendly\n4) Unlimited free Diet Coke ... fellow Diet Coke fans I mean this is amazing, cmon!\n\nToday, we went for an early afternoon date and to break in my husbands new glock. We were assigned lane 7 which we haven't been on before and is at the end of the range closest to the door. First thing when we walked in, the smell! It seriously smelt like cow manure and was FREEEEEZING. An older lady was on lane 3 or 4 and had shared this with the RSO who said \"it isn't that cold, enjoy it! It'll be 110 before you know it and now it's only 63\" 63 degrees, air blasting on an 80 degree weather day so patrons (like myself) are wearing shorts and walking out with goosebumps. But whatever, I shoot guns like a boss - no cold will scare me out!\n\nSo we're in there, five minutes tops and the RSO, Joe comes by and hands me a broom and tells me to sweep my brass - which I never mind doing - however I had shot two mags through my Gun totaling 16 brass pieces of my own around me and I'm the one and only patron sweeping brass. But ok, I'll let it slide. I'd say another ten minutes go by and I'm told to hold on - just me (not a seize on the range) and to clean up the brass again. Needless to say, I was a little annoyed. But I smiled, swept the brass and kept going. \n\nI left for ten minutes max to grab some of that unlimited Diet Coke and use the bathroom where my husband signals me back in. Says Joe once again has made him sweep brass after going through ONE magazine (6 bullets). That was our cue to be done for the day. \n\nWe shared our concern with two associates out front who looked dumbfounded with no want to fix it. I think I'll be heading to The Range or American Shooters moving forward.
