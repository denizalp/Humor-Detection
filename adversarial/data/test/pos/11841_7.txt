Great place when you want to go downtown, but don't want the drama of the W.6th nasties.  Nieghborhood atmosphere in a downtown setting.  Good place for the \"young professional' crowd.  Totally agree with the hot bartender statement.  drool. \nFood is awesome too.  A fine gentlemen once shared a pizza with me there after he politely moved my car since I was too intoxicated to do myself.  In fact I did not even know this man, yet trusted him with my keys.  Perhaps my recolection of 'awesome' food can not be trusted.\nAlso one time I saw people wearing snuggies there.  \nThey have a juke box too.
