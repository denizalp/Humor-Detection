This could possibly be my favorite place to eat from now on! Great service, great food and just an all around cute restaurant! Our great experience started from the second we turned onto the property. A friendly man told us were to park. We entered and were greeted by a smile. We were seated quickly. We let JR, our fantastic server, know that we were on our way to a show and were limited on time. He then made suggestions as to what entrees would be best. I ordered the crab cakes, which are by far the best I have ever had in the valley! They were all crab and no filler. I laughed at my husband for ordering the meatloaf, although JR said that it is really good. To my surprise, that even came out looking and smelling fantastic. My husband truly enjoyed every single bite. \nIt's far too often that one spends too much money on a dinning experience that's not enjoyed. Coronado Cafe far exceeds many of the most expensive restaurants in the Phoenix area in service, flavor and charm and I can't wait to go back. This is what a restaurant should be.
