First timer! Brought in 4 bags of clothes. They only took 5 items, which included $40 brand new jeans and some $30 tops with tags still on it, and yet I got $17. LOL next time I'll just give them all to goodwill because this wasn't worth 30 minutes of my time or the shame carrying everything back out. \/)_-\n\nI also felt a little bad for all the other people who's things they did not take. There's really no point in coming here just to make $2-$3 off of stuff you could just donate, unless you brought in $200 sunglasses, maybe they'll give you $10???? Hahahah last timer!
