In a word - Intense!\nYoga Tree - Richmond Hill is a well laid out, beautifully equipped, spotlessly clean and tidy studio.  The change rooms are very nicely appointed with lockers, showers, nice soaps.  \nThe hot studio is spacious, and warm (OK, make that hot!) with a wonderful cork floor that is comfortable on your bare feet.\n\nI'm not a newbie to yoga but had never experienced hot yoga before and let me re-iterate - Intense!!  The instructor leads you through a series of basic yoga postures all the while in an intensely hot room leaving you in a puddle of your own sweat - exhausted but exhilarated at the same time.  It helps to have a basic knowledge of yoga before attending these classes as the instructor doesn't so much teach or help with adjustments but just guides you through the series of poses like they would at a gym class.  \n\nWhat Yoga Tree lacks in the meditative aspects of yoga, it more than makes up in the physical aspects.  Perhaps that is what the market demands.  \n\nFor those with a bit of experience behind their practice and are in the market for a very nice space in which to practice, Yoga Tree certainly delivers.    \n\nRealizing that every instructor is different, it will take trying out different classes and instructors before settling on one that you are most comfortable with.
