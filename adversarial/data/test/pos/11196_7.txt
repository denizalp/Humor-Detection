Still one of my favorite places to go, even though it's getting a bit overcrowded.  The atomic dog is the best wiener to put in your mouth after midnight.  Injected with jalapeno? Si, por favor.  Always where I end up to get a bunch of drinks, or after having a bunch of drinks.  No judging here.  At least to my face.
