CRAVE SUCKED PERIOD. Service was good, food not so much. I had juicier fish from McDonalds and the steak was dried no where near medium rare and both that and the plain mash was cold and the drinks were horrible. I hate hate hate giving bad reviews and I haven't in a LONNNNNNG TIME but I really have to warn everyone for the money I would've gotten the same quality, taste and maybe more enjoyable food at Denny's for 3 times less. Sorry to be so harsh but I was genuinely disappointed. It was so busy and I can't wrap my brain around why because there was nothing good about the food here. If the food didn't come out as quick as it did I would've been livid! Even my 4 and 2 year old op to avoid their free mac and cheese and pizza (thank god they were free) because I mean they hardly even touched their fries. I normally obsessively research good places to eat and this time I didn't and I truly wished I did. This was a classic case of Looks Good, Sounds Good, Smells Good but the total opposite of Good! Like others I too am a bit confused at where they were going with their concept I mean I get something for everyone's craving but trust me there's nothing here that I'll CRAVE again! \n\nSo needless to it's a never again for me, such a flop. Total pass! \n\nP.S. Check out the garnish in my old Fashion that's pictured...looks like it was from a chop shop smh casual semi-fine dinning embarrassment if you ask me. I think I've had better Old Fashion all around better looking better tasting at an airport. It was just bad, everything about it was just bad. Also have you hear of a strainer, in the picture my wife got the martini thing which had pepper flakes floating all up in it. The name of the drink wasn't a disaster it was just a complete disaster. \n\nThe sad part is the resturant and the people there are so nice and I've said this before sometimes if the food isn't all that great but the service is, it makes all the difference but the food experience was so ugh at Crave that it trumps the service this time around.
