Sunday night, too lazy to cook?  Need something good and cheap??  Pho checks off all those boxes baby!\n\nDecided to have some Sunday night dinner at Pho Vuon Lai and have to say it was a very good choice.\n\nLocated in Alton Towers, Pho Vuon Lai serves some solid authentic Vietnamese food in the area.\n\nWe really enjoyed our meal here as all the dishes came out quickly and delicious, but the highlight as what most people have said are the fried spring rolls.  They are much bigger then most places and beautifully presented on a fried wonton skin wrapper.\n\nThe pho here is very good but the standout part is that they give you a lot of fillings....most places the noodle to soup ratio is about 30\/70.  Here its closer to 50\/50 so for big eaters like me you will be very satisfied especially if you order XL.\n\nSolid choice for pho in the area!  4\/5
