Very enjoyable stay at the MGM Grand. What was so great about it you ask? For one a nice large room. Very modern with a wall of mirrors and beautiful art work. I wish I could have taken that art with me.\n\nA large modern bathroom with marble flooring and shower tiles. Semi-private commode. The shower has a raindrop shower head which isn't my favorite but the water was hot enough. Just wish there was handheld shower head with more power.\n\nIn the bathroom plenty of towels and wash clothes. I was not at all impressed with the soaps however. The soaps and shampoos provided were not luxurious and had virtually no smell. And speaking of soaps once you used them the housekeeping staff did not refill them. Odd. I spotted a house keeper in the hall and asked for more. She loaded me up with them. \n\nOne of the most genius things was the open ended toilet paper holder. Why didn't they think of this sooner? One end of the toilet paper dispenser is left free so the refilling is a snap. I have got to look for one those for my bathroom.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable with few exceptions. The pillows were large and surprising heavy. I've never encountered that in a pillow before. They were cumbersome to move around. Concerning the sheets I was reminded of a Seinfeld episode in which George did not want the corners tucked. The sheets were tucked so tightly I could not move my feet. A serving tray sits on the foot of bed and makes a great snack table for drunken feasts in the middle of the night.\n\nYes of course there is free wifi available on up to 4 devices (i think). There are two options of wifi available. One being free and the other a turbo charged version is I believe $50 per day so be very careful to select the free option. Once connected wifi is available through out the hotel.\n\nA very nice work station sits in front of a mirrored wall. A large picture window includes two type of powered shades. Light diffusing and black out. Took me a minute to figure out how to use that but it was a nice feature. I opted for light diffusing. You can still see out but it blocks harsh light. Blackout, well you know what that is.\n\nThere is a mini bar in the room and naturally it consists of overpriced items. I'm not sure if certain rooms come with more mini bar options but there was a list of items on the menu that i did not see in my room. Perhaps you had to call up for them. Who knows?\n\nBe forewarned. Don't think you can eat some $8 pringles and then replace them with a 99 cent version from the local Walmart or whatever the equivalent is in Vegas. As soon as you pick an item up off the tray you will be charged. Even if you just pick it up and replace it.\n\nWhat is there to do at MGM Grand? So, so much. Eat of course. There is a food court and if you go you'll want to stop at the place that makes the crepes. there's also a McDonalds if you want to watch your budget.\n\nFor finer dining check out Emeril's, Joel Rubochon, Tom Collichio's or Wolfgang Puck's restaurants. I've heard tell there is a buffet at the Grand. In fact I was there years before but this time around I did not see\/find it. So i'm not sure if it's still there.\n\nYou may also want to check out Wet Republic the pool\/night club. And speaking of nightclubs do stop into Rouge it's fantastic! If you are bored you can also do the CSI game\/tour where you try and solve a crime CSI style.\n\nNaturally there is gaming and lots of it. There's a pretty large casino and while smoking is allowed there is a lovely fragrance piped in which does nicely to drown out the smell of cigarettes unless of course you happen to be near someone smoking.\n\nThe hotel is very large but surprisingly easy to navigate. I didn't get lost once.\n\nThe Grand is a bit far down the strip within walking distance is Excalibur which has an indoor walkway that will take you the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. To venture further down the strip you may want to purchase a daily pass for the Deuce. The Vegas Strip Bus. An all day pass is only $8 and it runs approximately every 15 minutes 24 hours a day.\n\nThere is a system for hailing a car or taxi but much like check-in there is often a long line. I caught a taxi several times before I wised up and learned of the bus. It seems there is no such thing as a taxi ride under $20 in Vegas.
