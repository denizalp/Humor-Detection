I enjoy just how awful this place is, especially Wednesdays. The bartender is a poor miserable soul. Can't blame him as he must suffer open jam night where several very kind yet musically-challenged gentlemen in their 60s butcher their favorite 70s hits. \n\nI think this place is a warning - you can see the result of a lifetime of poor decisions. This wisdom will be unsolicited yet imparted by the drunk soul that takes you under his wing (followed by a treatise on American rock music and how you can better play your instrument. \n\nI'll go back. It's painful. Funny. Annoying. But I'll go back.
