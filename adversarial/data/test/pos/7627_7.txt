We walked in Friday night at 5:30pm and there were 3 people in the entire restaurant. I stood at the front door and watched two young women talk to each other in the back hallway and never bother to walk up and speak to us. I walked to the back of the restaurant and explained that we did not have a reservation, but we would eat super quick if they could seat us. She stated, \"sure - how many?\" I said two and a baby and she instantly said \"no.\" She was cold, unapologetic, and just plain unfriendly. \nWe were expecting to be turned away b\/c we didn't have a reservation, so she could have politely told us that they had no availability. \nDoes The Westerly not do children or is it just sub par customer service? \nWe have recently moved to Roncy from SF, CA and are huge foodies, but I cannot imagine giving this place another try.
