The best Dumplings I've Had!\n\nIt's sad to see that most people gave it a bad review.  My girlfriend and I think they're GREAT!  They're different from \"Ding Tai Fung.\"  I've been told that the Northern and Southern Chinese cuisine are vastly different.  I've noticed a lot of dishes on their menu are spicy.  There's a little  language barrier, waitress speaks Mandarin and very little English.  Not a problem, menu is in English, top to bottom and all you have to do is write your order # on a scrap piece of paper. No talking required unless you like to chat up your waitress. Service is quick and efficient to boot.\n\nTheir dumplings are thin and juicy.  Love the texture and taste of the soup popping in my mouth.  Our usual orders are #B3 (6 dumplings), Hot & Sour Soup (really spicy), Hot & Spicy Octopus legs, Cucumber & Vermicelli paper with soy\/peanut sauce, Smoked Duck (half and plenty for 2 or more), and Pickled cabbage & shredded pork with clear noodles.  Also, cheap local beers!
