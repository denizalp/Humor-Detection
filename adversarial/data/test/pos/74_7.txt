I like that they always have a sorbet option & that it changes often :)\nI know it's not health food, but when I'm trying to be good, this is a better 'cheat' than the chocolate ice cream with brownie, chocolate chips and chocolate sauce :D\nToday I had the strawberry mango sorbet. I had them mix in black berries, pineapple & crushed almonds. The result was pretty amazing, if I do say so myself! \n\nThe service was friendly. They've added a few more tables and chairs, so we had more seating options. Always a plus!
