This past Saturday was the first time that I dined in a famous Dave's. My brother and I were on the way to the Cannery, and he told me that I ought to give it a try. Why not, it was across the highway?\n\n   The service from the \"Welcome to Famous Dave's\" upon entering the door to the the time that we paid our bill was exceptional. We were treated to complimentary potato chips that could give Frito Lay's a run for their money if they were sold in supermarkets. My brother and I were never rushed.  Our personable waitress was prompt on drink refills. The Manager even asked how everything was. After the meal there was zero pressure to stop talking and leave. I am under the impression that customer service matters at Famous Dave's. Likewise, customer service matters with my reviews. With that in mind, I upped my rating of this Famous Dave's from 3 & 1\/2 to 4 stars.\n\n   After seating us at one of the many booths overlooking the bar, our waitress explained the P.I.G. Club. I am so against joining anything called P.I.G. Club. This made me conscientious of what I was going to put in my body. I deviated from the typical BBQ restaurant brisket, ribs, chicken thing and ordered Dave's Favorite Burger. Dave's Favorite Burger may not be Daniel S's favorite burger, however, it was good. From a quarter century of dining in BBQ restaurants, I have come to the conclusion that they prepare well-done burgers. Dave's Favorite Burger included melted jack cheese, smoked bacon, and Dave's Favorite sauce. As expected, the burger was sticky. It seemed that I used the equivalent of a dead baby tree to wipe my hands constantly. Overall I enjoyed the burger and the french fries that came with it.\n\n   What stands out at Famous Dave's are all the sauces on the table. I had the choice of sweet & saucy, Texas Pit, Devil's Spice, Rich & saucy, and Georgia Mustard. There was the standard ketchup next to all the sauces.\n\n  I am glad that I finally dined in a Famous Dave's. It is not guaranteed that I will return to one in the immediate future. What is guaranteed is that I will not be joining the P.I.G Club.\n\n------This is review 67 of the 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge-----
