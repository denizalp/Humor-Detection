I went to my first show at Dirty Diana's after a night hanging out with a group of friends in Tremont.  The entertainment that night was excellent.  \n\nThe drag queen had obviously spent a lot of time getting dolled up.  The guy playing the tweeker part was talented and scratched the bejesus out of his neck\/arm.  Seeing a texas sized afro was pretty sweet.  The final performance from the dude in the mesh shirt deserved a standing o.\n\nOur waitress for the event was very accommodating although I've had better breakfast at a truck stop.\n\none star for the food\nthree for service\nfour for entertainment
