It was almost everything I'd hoped it would be. Almost.\n\nChada Thai & Wine is widely regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Some even place it above the nationally renowned Lotus of Siam. I finally got to experience the upstart restaurant today. I knew from visits to the area that it's in a large plaza on the eastern edge of Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn. Its sign is modest, so look for it in the middle of the plaza, between a karaoke place and a much more prominent District One.\n\nChada only offers dinner service, and the interior is appropriately dim. Despite my photos attached to this review, the colors were definitely muted by the low light. The restaurant is also relatively cozy, with not much more than forty seats available. Despite that, it wasn't crowded at all on a Wednesday night and we were seated promptly even without a reservation. I also love the alternative rock that they play in here (Muse, Imagine Dragons, Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, and others), which makes this restaurant one of my favorites anywhere music-wise.\n\nMy mom and I were far more interested in the Thai than the Wine. We didn't get any alcohol, but we shared a number of dishes.\n\nKai Yang ($8.00): grilled marinated Cornish hen w\/ spicy fish sauce. Moist chicken, nice spices, very sour sauce. Quite delicious, especially considering that it's just a chicken dish. Go easy on the sauce.\n\nPanang Curry ($9.00): slow-cooked hanger steak in Panang curry. Rich coconut curry that still had quite a kick when ordered \"mild\" (results may vary, but I'm pretty sensitive to spicy foods). Delicious, tender beef. What more can you ask for?\n\nKana Moo Krob ($9.00): Chinese broccoli w\/ so-called crispy pork belly. The Chinese broccoli was nice, and the sauce was also tasty. The pork belly was certainly not crispy as advertised. It was very tough to chew and a bit too salty, as if overcooked, and the pork belly skin that should've been crispy ended up being a sticky, chewy mess, as if it had been allowed to soak up the juices for a while. I don't know what happened here, but whether it's improper execution or something else, I'm really not sold on this thing.\n\nPad Kra Pow w\/ sliced pork ($8.00): stir-fried meat w\/ chili and Thai basil. It's a relatively sweet dish but doesn't go overboard. The pork is meaty and works well, but I wouldn't mind trying a premium protein (crispy duck, rib eye) or an equally inexpensive alternative (chicken, beef, ground pork) on a different occasion. Overall, not as impressive as the Kai Yang or the Panang Curry, but certainly better than the Kana Moo Krob.\n\nSides of rice ($1.50) and sticky rice ($2.50) complemented the tasty courses. They're reasonable portions for the cost. The regular rice is served in a bowl. The sticky rice is wrapped in plastic and served in a basket. No issues with either.\n\nPrices were reasonable for the portions. We probably had one extra dish's worth at the end. Service was fine. Pacing could've been improved slightly. The kitchen had almost all the dishes come out at once, and probably would have gotten them all simultaneously had I not waited a few minutes on the Pad Kra Pow order. I would've rather had two dishes to dissect at a time rather than all four, so I'll have to remember to request that next time.\n\nBased on tonight's experiences, I'll probably return to Chada Thai & Wine and delve deeper into their menu. I'll just be sure to skip the flawed pork dish.
