I am perpetually on a hunt for all things Mexican, unfortunately our quest does not stop here. It's a decent enough store but it was low on variety and product. The search goes on.\n\nMy Mexican sister-in-law and I drove to Cleveland to stock up on Mexican spices, pan dulce (sweet bread), and other Mexican treats. Walking in the store, it smells like Mexico, it made us feel right at home. It was so nice to see brown people, as my nephews call other Mexicans. We live in Canton, which is low on brown. :)\n\nWe arrived around 1 p.m. on Thursday and the deli counters were very empty. The seafood was completely empty. The red meat counter only had a few items in it and the chicken area had the most variety. It was nice to see familiar cuts - like adobo and flattened chicken breasts.\n\nEverything else was just ok. I wanted to get some sangria and could only find one brand, which isn't even the most popular. I want Sangria Senorial, which most places also carry in diet. \n\nWe also wanted specific Mexican candy that is also very popular (Pelon) and authentic Mexican vanilla. They had neither. We did get cajeta, which makes us happy.\n\nI don't know what people are talking about with a taco stand. The restaurant is now separate from the store, maybe its only on weekends or every other tuesday when its sunny and warm, no idea. They had deli food in the back but it was just your basic chicken and potato taquitos. They do however have the jewelry store so pick up some beans and an engagement ring.\n\nSo overall this store isn't bad, just isn't great. It doesn't carry much more than the super Walmart near my house in Mexican products. No need to drive all the way up there again to go.
