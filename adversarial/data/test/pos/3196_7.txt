Sucks! That was my overall experience! I am sorry! After we have been seated we waited about 10 minutes and no one came to greet us and to take orders!! What!!! We went around 1 PM on a Sunday and they were not even busy at all! I wonder how bad it could have been if they were actually busy! After 10 minutes here came this waitress who looked like just woke up from a nap or something. So unprofessional! She looked like she didn't want to be there!! Wow!! And the food sucked too!! Chicken was so burnt!!! Literally black! And tasted burned! Too small portions felt like its kid's meal or something!!! I will never ever go there again!!
