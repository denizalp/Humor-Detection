Having known the owners of this long standing operation, I know they are trustworthy, honest, upfront, and hard working.  I have watched them expand their store size, service offerings, industry knowledge, and professionalism. \nRecommended for all car audio needs...these guys know their stuff. They also do car starters and even in home audio visual setups.  \nRecommended if you are looking for local car audio professionals who know what they are talking about.  I have sent friends and family to go in for work and would always recommend.  A+ service.
