Always a shaking start due to the receptionists but the hair dressers especially Alyssa, are amazing with mixing color, fun cuts, and unbelievable scalp massages!!!  It took me 6 months to find a great place to get my hair done once I moved to Vegas and now this is my spot.  I would just recommend confirming, re-confirming your appt and stylist.
