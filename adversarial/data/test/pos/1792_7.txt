Happy Hour Friday\/Saturday\/Sunday from 3:30 - 5:30!\n\nHouse Beer 15oz for $4 which is a Steam Whistle! Or if you are like me, prefer a glass of white wine $5.\n\nOysters from $1.35 each or $16 for a dozen...We opted for the French Kiss which is $1.75 each or $20 for a dozen instead...\n\nThere are also other cooked seafood on the menu if you are not into oysters. \n\nMost items are $1 or $2 less than what they charge on the regular menu, so not really a huge difference in prices.\n\nFishbar is definitely a good place to have a drink or 2 and chill out a bit in between meals. Since it was a Sunday late afternoon, the restaurant was really quiet with just our table at 5 pm.\n\nService was ok, we get what we want but did feel a little rush since the staff were prepping for dinner rush.\n\n$4 for a beer is really a good price..... I will be back!!
