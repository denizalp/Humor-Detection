Came here on Saturday night with a group of four. This place does have a lot of potential. The drinks were really tasty and service was prompt. The only thing that soured our experience was a server was way to drunk and annoying the patrons. When my friend was paying this server finger-banged her cleavage and tried to play the bongos on her butt as she was trying to escape. This server was loud and intrusive. I enjoyed watching her annoy the other patrons. When it came to us we left lol.
