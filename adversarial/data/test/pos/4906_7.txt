Located in a less than desireable area of Charlotte, we need to acknowledge that the Milestone isn't for everyone.\n\nBut it is one of the oldest punk\/hardcore\/metal\/rock venues in Charlotte, and legend has it that Nirvana played there WAY back in the day.  \n\nIt is sort of an assault on your senses.  Visually, the band sticker\/graffiti decor can keep you entertained with all the random bands that have played there.  The music is going to be loud enough to leave your ears ringing in the packed little stage room.  In the summer months, you can tell that the power bill is not high because of air conditioning.  This not only turns everyone into a sweaty mess, but it makes the bathrooms an olfactory gauntlet.  They are also pretty lax on the no smoking policy.\n\nThe PBR tallboys are cold as most bands can tell you since I have seen more than one act showered in beer by the moshing crowd.\n\nMake sure you bring cash unless you care to deal with their less than comforting ATM behind the bar set up.
