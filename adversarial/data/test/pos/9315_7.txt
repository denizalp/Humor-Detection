I cannot stand this place. Every time I have come here, I leave feeling overwhelmed by their pushy sales people. Within 5 minutes of walking in, I have always had multiple employees approach me within minutes of each other. I get that it's a small business and needs to make money, but this place is just unreal. \n\nMost frequently, I had called them this past winter to see if they sold, and I specified, Ugg brand boot cleanser. The girl over the phone told me that they did. Within a half hour of making a trip over there, I walk in and of course within seconds, a man asked me what I needed help finding (not IF, but WHAT). So I told him I needed Ugg brand shoe cleanser just so I could get in and get out. It was of course, per normal, so noisy I had to practically shout it to him. He said they had it and would bring it to me. \n\nHe walked back with and off-brand shoe cleanser and said they were out of Ugg brand shoe cleanser, even after just being told over the phone they specifically had the Ugg brand. Now, I'm not trying to sound like a snob, but they are the nicest boots I have ever owned, so that is why I was very specific about having the same brand of cleanser that made the boots. I just wanted them to be taken well care of. So, I looked at the stuff, probably obviously a little apprehensive, and he said \"I have been working here for years and this stuff works great\" and kept pushing it and pushing it on me for another few minutes. I mean, we're talking like $4 shoe cleanser or whatever, and he was hard selling me. Normally I don't fall for it, but all of the other shoe retailers that sell Uggs were sold out of shoe cleanser (hence, why I left this place as a last result option) so I didn't really have a choice and I bought the stuff.\n\nI did exactly what the directions said to do and within a few days of treating my boots, some of the material on the outside of the boot was wearing off and thinning. I don't know if it's because of the stuff the guy sold me, but it doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. The product is shotty I think, which in my opinion aligns with the business.\n\nNever again will I go here.
