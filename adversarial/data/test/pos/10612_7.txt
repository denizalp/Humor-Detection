Mo at Mochanics came highly recommended to me by a colleague. I have been using this mechanic now for two years and will not take my vehicles anywhere else! They fix all makes and models at this small shop. There is nothing fancy or pretentious about Mochanics but their service is second to none. Mo will tell you like it is when you bring your vehicle to him for repairs. He is very reasonably priced and will explain to you everything that needs to be done and why. He is also very good at letting you know what to watch out for in the future with your vehicle. I have recommended him to my friends and family who all now take their vehicles to him for servicing.\n\nOutstanding!
