Was faced with the unusual situation of needing an eye exam ASAP - a friend had a hookup for me to get Zeiss lenses @ cost.  Being somewhat allergic to large chain operations, I began a targeted search within 5 subway stops in either direction to find someone who could see me right away.  \n\nThis is a super-discount operation directly to the western side of Landsdowne station.  I was initially a bit concerned by the..uh...budget furnishings in the clean but well worn waiting area.  The receptionist was professional and after a brief wait, I was taken back to see the Doctor.  \n\nDr. Dhillon was young, extremely professional, super-competent and gave me a truly first class eye exam.  Infinitely superior to the type one gets at the concessions in the chain stores, she spent time on each phase of the process, explained results, offered suggestions that were truly insightful and simply exceeded the hell out of my admittedly modest expectations.\n\nSo, what started out as an \"any port in a storm\" effort uncovered a very quality professional that I would recommend to anyone.
