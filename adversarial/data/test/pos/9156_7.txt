Okay, it was either La Salsita's or McDonald's last night.  I would have spent the same amount of money at either location, but I was craving some McDoubles.  I had to go to my trusty McDonald's that I go to in the morning for breakfast.  There is a closer McD's near where I live, but they suck!\n\nWe pulled around the corner and my husband goes \"There is such a long line\".  I told him \"No Worries cause this place is fast.\"  He ordered and it took him a lot of time to order.  I felt bad for the cashier inside.  After his long order, we were at the window in no time getting our food.  \n\nWhen we arrived home, the top buns on my McDoubles seemed to be a bit dry, but I just took those off.  The burgers were still yummy and NOT greasy.  My husband got the chicken nuggets (which were crispy and flakey, me likey) and I loved how they put a lot of sauces in the bag.  I even asked for some extra and they had no problem giving us more.  I love that!  \n\nI will be coming back for a late night snack again soon.
