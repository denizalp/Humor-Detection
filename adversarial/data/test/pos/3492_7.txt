Worst service ever looking at rings with Ella here. Would not give us detailed explanation of the 4cs or show us examples of each. The chart she showed us was completely in Chinese which we can't read. Simply spent 15 minutes rambling on about the Tiffany difference and ignored our requests and then questions. Went in happy, came out annoyed but went across the mall and had a 10\/10 over the top experience at Cartier. I will say another gentleman consultant here seemed very friendly knowledgeable and willing to listen. He also offered the other couple some tea or water and a place to put their winter coats! Imagine that!...\n\nBad experience. Avoid Ella when ring shopping!
