This place was good....it was pricey but that is to be expected, also why I gave it 4 stars....we were there on may 5th for my birthday and also the weekend of the fight so there were a lot of people out. It was strange to see some empty tables....the jalepeno yello tail was my absolute favorite...it was soooo good!!!!..their cocktails were good too (pomegranite martini....oh so yummy) so I dont remember much of what else I had to review it:) \n\nP.S. we saw Michael J. Fox there
