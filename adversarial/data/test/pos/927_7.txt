I'm giving this place a 1 star \"Eek! Methinks not.\" review.  Not because the food was terrible, it wasn't.  But the overall experience is one that I need not repeat.\nThis restaurant is located near the airport, and the minute you step in, it's like a blast into the past -- like the 1970's past, and I believe we are now living in 2014.  The decor is dark and VERY dated.  The atmosphere is heavy like L.A. smog.  The service is a little too on-point.  The second my fork was put down, someone was there to try and take away my plate.  I wouldn't mind so much, except for the fact no one else was finished with their food yet, (and neither was I).  The price point is WAAAAY off.  It is very, very, VERY expensive.  Expect a main to cost you over $30, easily.  And that's just for the main.  I had the Prime Rib, which was good and the size of my face.  Peppercorn steak was ordered, and that was prepared well, but like the room, the plating of food was not very creatively assembled.  Polite people working the restaurant, but the whole experience is not what I will ever crave for again.
