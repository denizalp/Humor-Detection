So we got free tickets to this, not sure I would pay full price for the tickets if I had to for this show.\n\nThey have a decent number of girls, who dance and lip-synch to pop music and such. The costumes are pretty cool, and they do interact with the audience; they have a guy who is a magician that goes around between sets and tries to get everyone pumped. \n\nThe group acts were not that great, but there were a few solo ones that really stood out, especially the last one- now that one is funny. \n\nAll in all it's an ok show.
