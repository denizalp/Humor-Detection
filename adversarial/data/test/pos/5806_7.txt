I've been here enough times for brunch.\nI could spend $30 so easily and leave semi full...I'll get hungry again real quick.\n\nI normally get their Croque madame for brunch.\nRoasted chicken is also pretty tasty.\n\nBut last time I hit this place up with a friend for a late dinner and had the Steak Diane.\nI loved it...and guess what? It's NOT GRILLED!!! I mean...why did I order this?\nI love my meat GRILLED!\nOh cuz I was buzzed and I get really really nice and not so picky when i'm buzzed...\nThe server recommended it and so did my friend...so I said \"yes\"...and I didn't lose this time. A Benjamin well spent for us.\nI believe this steak was pan seared...or maybe even broiled? Dunno...but it was damn good...they got all the veggies right too! Perfectly cooked.\n\nAnyways...I love love love the patio area...it's so romantic and pretty!\nMy girl friend and I both agreed the setting makes us \"look\" so pretty...but then again we were both buzzed...maybe it was the midnight goggles?? lol\n\nWhile we were waiting...we had a few drinks at the bar...\nand they even gave us little bar snacks (gratis!) Wait...maybe it's supposed to be free...either way...I'm game for anything free...especially at such a place. haha
