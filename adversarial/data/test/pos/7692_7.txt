If you have no where else to go I guess it's a an alternative.   However once you've gone here a few times you start to realize how cramped the tiny area you get to shoot in is it's like shooting in a cave or something and the lighting is very poor.  I'm so glad I didn't get membership here.  Also the prices they have on there gear is outrageous,  Haven't those people heard of the internet.  Hello is anybody home...lol...If you must have one of these products they sell, then order it off the internet that is if you if you work hard for your money and want to save some bucks.  My new shooting place is going to be Been Avery or the open desert from now on.
