I was needing to pick up a couple of things and happened to be just down the street so I figured why not? Parking is fairly ample. The store itself isn't a bad size - it's a little small but what you'd expect for a strip mall.\n\nThe prices seemed high, though, especially for wine. I noticed several bottles where the prices are $5+ less elsewhere. Since I was in a time crunch, I just purchased what I needed anyway, but I likely wouldn't go back unless I was desperate. \n\nReview #29 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
