\"Pah-da-pa-pa-paaaah!\" I've never dined inside nor have I played in their Play Place. 4.5 ****Ã— as I won't be covering those parts of service. I think being a kid at heart will still result in strange looks from other parents, if I ever did get to play in the Play Place. BUT this review is isolated to their drive-thru service; so that's irrelevant :P\n\nI have nothing awful to say here. I love that they have two lanes and either lane at anytime I've decided to drive through, there is voice wanting to know what you're hungry for. If it isn't fries for me, then hash browns. And they're ALWAYS crispy... with salsa please. Fries ALWAYS off the fryer with some of my fave soggy ones I will hunt for first. (Please don't question why I prefer crispy hash browns but soggy fries. It's a natural characteristic.)\n\nWho doesn't want a super-size drink for just a $1. Any size all day! Great sweet tea and enough ice left over for my crunching habit. Then their Caramel Macchiatos ALWAYS hot! Trust the cup warning. With non-fat milk it's still super delish and creamy. Today though, they apologized for having me wait for it. They gave me a complimentary ticket for free small fries, or pie, or cone. Even after parking in the reserved drive-thru waiting spot, a couple minutes later my yummy hot and cozy warms up my tummy Caramel Macchiato is being brought to me.\n\nThis is what prompted my review. They have standards and they wanna live up to it. They're an international brand. How does a little kink in service matter to them this much? Because us as customers have expectations. For me an apology and explanation would've been sufficient. This complimentary ticket just shows how they will scrutinize themselves for me, due to those little kinks in quick efficient service. You guys this is quality. They want to be excellent at it! Approval nods from me. And thank you!
