Service was very professional and the food is the same stuff (and appears to be the same price) as Sidecar. I've never encountered drinks like this in Toronto, though in Vancouver there are a couple of places that have great drinks like this that you don't have to pay $285 a year to go to. It seems a bit steep to pay close to $300 to drink fancy cocktails in a nice environment. But they're really nice cocktails and a really nice environment. I am slowly being seduced by its charm into buying a membership. I haven't found cocktails of this calibre anywhere else in Toronto, so it's quite tempting to join. \n\nI'm curious about the housemade tonic water. Scaramouche has a pretty great gin and tonic so I'm curious to see how this one compares. \n\nI like the way they organize their menu based on the type of liquor used. I had the Imperial Fizz and tried some of the Sazerac. Both were delicious! This is a great place for people who truly appreciate cocktails--and I do, I'm just not sure if I appreciate it enough to pay $285 a year to drink them. This is a tough decision, but trying it out is really making me think about getting one... What ever happened to ladies night? Girls get in free? Maybe I'll just have to make friends with someone who has one of those memberships since members can bring up to 3 guests. And now to make this sound like part-review and part-personal ad: Do any friendly fun Yelpers have one? I like fancy cocktails and long walks up dark stairwells (if they lead to TTS) ... :p
