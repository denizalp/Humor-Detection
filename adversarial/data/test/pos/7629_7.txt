Place was empty when we came in for a very early dinner. Our hotel was nearby in this primarily Asian hood. It's not a neighborhood I would seek out but if staying at a hotel nearby this was a great meal. Note for reference they do not serve alcohol but plum juice comes standard. \n\nWe sat at a table and there's a boiler plate in the center for the pots. They recommended the \"all you can eat\" pot. It comes with a menu and you receive little pencils & a piece of paper to mark off which meats you'd like and a separate order sheet for sauces. \nThere was a language barrier but their system with the meats & vegetables translated really negates any issue. \n\nWe highly recommend the all you can eat pots. \n- pick your broth (2) be sure to pick the flavors included in the \"all you can eat\" if that's your plan\n- pick your meat, vegetables, seafood & noodles \n- pick your sauces \n\nWe had the following sauces, all authentic and delicious: garlic, red bean curd, oyster, sesame oil, flowering garlic chives (very pungent), & chili paste.  They'll refill at your request. \n\nOne large bowl, divided down the center with a divider for two broth options. We ordered preserved  egg & parsley broth for the seafood base and pork bone broth for the base of the meats we ordered. The broths themselves were loaded with flavor but not overly salty. \n\nWe ordered shrimp, mussels (only 2 large are served & are frozen), Chinese parsley, watercress and fish balls. We also had the black fungi, so good. My husband are the century egg that came with the broth. Loved it. \n\nFor the meat we used the pork bone broth and ordered, beef, pork, fungi, egg, broccoli, Napa cabbage, and black fungi. The meat is sliced impeccably thin so it cooks quickly. It's very fresh unlike the seafood which is all previously frozen. \n\nAfter I finished my husband ordered the tripe. I'm not a fan but he was happy and the serving was substantial. He also had the Odon noodles which was a small serving but he enjoyed them. \n\nWe really enjoyed this place. My husband could not stop reminiscing about his childhood meals. He said it tasted like his grandmothers cooking, quite the compliment. \nThe restaurant is quiet and in a college area of town but would definitely feed a hungry crew. \nThey also include an herbal jello or mango pudding at the end for the dessert. \n\nAgain, I wouldn't seek it out if you were staying downtown because it's a trek but if you're in this neck of the woods, it's a very authentic and substantial meal.
