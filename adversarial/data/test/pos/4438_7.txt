My husband attended Terros for mental health issues.  To make a long story short they had a driver there named Emily who would pick my husband up and drop him off everyday, turns out this ex heroin addict became obsessed with him and began to be extremely inappropriate with him sending dirty pictures of her nasty self and amongst other things.  I made them aware of the situation and nothing was done.  I tried and tried tell them and she is still working there and diligently trying to get in touch with my husband.  This place didn't even help him at all needless he is receiving the services he needs now.  This place is a joke!!!  Don't send your loved ones there it literally treat you like cattle call!  I wouldn't even give this place a one star!
