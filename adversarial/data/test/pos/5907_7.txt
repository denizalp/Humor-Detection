Avoid this place at all costs! The \"doctor\" didn't wait for the pain medication to take effect before she started the procedure, when I yelped (no pun) she literally yelled at me to keep quiet and that \"its an abortion; its SUPPOSED to hurt!. \nWhen I arched my back out of pain, the \"nurse\" forced my hips down and the \"doctor\" threatened to leave whatever was left inside me to rot. She snidely asked \"can I finish!?\" Before I could answer she shoved the implement in and started the suction again. \nAfterwards, when I started to cry from the pain, the \"nurse\" snapped \"not here, hurry up and get off the table\" and slapped a pad onto me and yanked my arm so hard I have a bruise. She literally dragged me into the dingy \"recovery room\" where women sit in worn recliners on paper towels and are fed stale cookies. I was kept there for 12 minutes while I vomited into a garbage bag, then handed a script for antibiotics and told to dress and leave. \nI cannot believe this place is allowed to operate, its dirty and horribly staffed.
