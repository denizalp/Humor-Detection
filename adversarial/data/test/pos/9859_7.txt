This airport is one letter away from being the most unfortunately designated airport in the American Republic or something that some men just can't seem to find.  \n\nThe only bad thing I have to say about this airport is that the employees seem to clump up in conversation circles in keep foot traffic points.  Stand by the wall like a junior high dance if you're going to talk on the job, don't make a big traffic mess.  \n\nThis airport has lovely shops - you know, in case you need to a bow tie from Brooks Brothers at 6:30 AM or something - and restaurants that run the course from fast food to fine-ish dining.  If you're hungry in this airport and an oil heiress you won't be hungry long.  Of course it is all expensive because it's the airport.  You're trapped there, I'm not mad at them: it is what it is.  \n\nI've been here two times and while I don't pick where I connect I am sure I'll connect through here again.
