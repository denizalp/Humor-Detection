I moved here recently and used Yelp to help me find a dentist for a routine check-up\/cleaning. I chose Bella Smiles because of the great reviews I had read, and sure enough I had a great encounter myself. I don't have dental insurance, but the prices were EXTREMELY affordable.\nFrom the moment I walked in, everyone was so friendly and helpful. I don't know the name of the lady who took my x-rays, but she was so friendly and made conversation with me. The lady who cleaned my teeth (again, I'm so bad with names), was so nice and did an amazing job. I only met with Dr. Chawla for a brief amount of time, as I was just getting a check-up, but he was friendly and knowledgable as well. I don't think I've ever gone to a dentist and got as thorough of an exam & cleaning as I did here. This will definitely be my new spot for routine dentist work!
