Ok let's start by saying I love Mexican food.  I think it would be safe to call me a connoisseur of Mexican food!  \n\nCesar Q. and I were starving so thanks to some great yelp reviews and pictures we decided to stop by this place.  \n\nThis place is unique.  You stand in line to place your order and then go take your seat.  Someone brings your food out to you.  So I guess this is considered \"fast casual\".  \n\nI ordered the carnitas\/pork nachos and the husband ordered a chicken quesadilla.  Prices were reasonable but portions were a bit small in comparison to what we had expected.  My nachos filled me up but I wasn't about to split.  The hubs felt the quesadilla was way to small for the price paid.  We ended up ordering the shrimp cocktail to make up for what we had already ordered.  \n\nI would recommend the shrimp cocktail as it is great!  The rest of the food was just so\/so.  \n\nWhat really annoys me is that while placing our order  while standing in line and paying there is a tip option on the receipt.  It's like going to Mc Donald's and tipping. You just don't do it.  Now that it's on my receipt I feel obligated to tip.  So of course I tip.  My food is brought out and no drinks on the tray.  I ask for water and the girl points to the ice water on the counter and tells me to do it myself.  I would like my tip back thank you very much. What's the point of tipping if your not serving? Ok enough with that.  \n\nThe food did not leave me thinking \"I need to come back\" like some places do....
