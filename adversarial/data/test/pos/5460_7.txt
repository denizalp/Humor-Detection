First off, let me say that I think the concept is awesome, but the reason for the lackluster starrage is the execution needs some work.\n\nI had a livingsocial coupon for a free beer and haircut.  I was pretty pumped about the experience as I like beer and I was a shaggy mess.  I walked into the bar side of the establishment, showed the bartender my coupon, and she gave me my free beer.  Needless to say, the first impression was pretty awesome...\n\n...an hour later I was still sitting at the bar and people that had come in after me were being taken in for their haircuts.  Luckily, one of the stylists noticed that I had been sitting there a while and asked me if I was getting a haircut.  When I told him yes, he pushed off other customers and took me back.  Apparently, when getting a haircut, you have to check in with the barbershop side of the place.  This seems like a huge issue with their business model.  I didn't expect to have to check in at two locations within one establishment.\n\nUpon leaving, I was a little annoyed that I had to wait so long for a simple haircut, but I could understand that it's a totally new (and mindblowingly awesome) concept, and there are some wrinkles to be worked out.\n\nWhen I got home, I had a chance to really check out my haircut and, unfortunately, it barely looks like I had anything cut off.  Sure, the sides are shaved, but I can do that myself at home.  The top (which I requested a finger-length scissor cut on), was barely touched.  The back of my head is pretty much the same length as it was when I walked in, and the front is barely shorter.  Ugh.  I'm going to have to go to my local Great Clips to get the haircut I really want.\n\nI hope that this place figures it out as all of the staff were friendly and I did have a good time there (as I usually do at bars), but the execution is way off and that tarnished my experience.  Will I give it another shot?  Sure, but I'm not going to go out of my way.
