Morning workout. I owned Napa, I've got to catch up here!!  With that said, if you can think of the WORST theatre you have been to, multiply that hate by 1000, you would really appreciate this place!  We were spoiled at Ultra Star, moved to Napa, to an old Centuty Dome - haunted theatre, still using movie reels and nappy chairs.  Blah! \n\nI digress, my review is for Ultra Star. It's AMAZING! The fact they offer morning movies for moms and dads, is a winner in itself.  I don't know about you, but there is nothing more annoying than watching a sex scene or a murder \/ rape scene and having little Timmy 2 year old slurping his boob juice behind you asking over and over \"what's that, what's that?!\". The motion seats are $$, but are worth it for those great movies. \n\nLove this place, daycare would e a plus like Harkins offers, but isn't a deal breaker! See me here at least 1 to 2 times a week, seeing something. :)
