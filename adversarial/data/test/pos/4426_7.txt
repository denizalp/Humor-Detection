I have never been to a Ranch Market before, so one night we stopped as we were very hungry. Myself, husband, and son waited in line for about 15 minutes. Every person who had been in line at the restaurant counter had their food, paid, and sat down to eat. The three of us stood there and waited for one of 6 employees behind the counter to acknowledge our presence. Not a one of them wanted to make eye contact, finally one of them came to the counter for assistance. Because my four year old is picky, I asked if I could get a chicken and rice meal. The employee looked at me, acted confused and said 'I don't think we have anymore chicken... You can go check at the other counter and see.' Really? I waited in line with my family for you (a customer service employee) to tell me that I needed (me, the customer) to check and see if you have chicken. Give me a break. I looked at her and said 'thanks for your help, appreciate it.' \n\nI know when I am not wanted, and when my money is not wanted. I will not be returning here, ever. I gave a rating of two stars because wanted to like this place, but unfortunately I was treated poorly.
