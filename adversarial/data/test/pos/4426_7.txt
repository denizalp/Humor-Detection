I live Trader Joes!\n We bought some lotion, got it home and it was partially used. The managers were more horrified than I was when I returned it. Lol\n I love the coffee, the organics, the speciality items, produce,Frozen foods, everything. \n There are usually more workers than customers, so every question gets answered.\n Mothers Day flowers on clearance, and new tea.\n Live it all.
