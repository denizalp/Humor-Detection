It's a little difficult to find this location if you're not a Palazzo guest- if you are, it's right where you come down to the casino floor, or use Chris V's review directions. This seems to be the designated one-stop-spot for those staying on site, with requisite beverages and grab-and-go food, as well as a selection of snacks and even wine by the bottle.\n\nCame in for a quick coffee. Good selection of breakfast and lunch dishes in the case, staff offered to heat up items as needed. Coffee menu has hot and cold beverages, went with barista's recommendation for a cold espresso drink- not sure what it was, but had a lot of foam and was very sweet, which wasn't what I asked for but was still actually pretty good.\n\nService is quick, prices were reasonable (for a casino), there are tables in the nearby lobby area if you want to eat on site. Drink station was messy considering they were between rushes and didn't have much business.
