Ok burger, albeit a bit bland and seemingly not fresh as advertised. Good beer selection, lame \"truffle\" fries. I might have even given it 3 stars if not for the convoluted ordering\/service system. \n\nI can understand \"order at the counter, here's your number\" but then you give us a server too. But that's not a server that can take your order, well they can take your drink order, and they'll bring you your food along with whatever else you need, but you still need to order your food at the counter. WTF? I don't get it, just let them take orders. Actually I do get it, they don't allow them to take your order because they are pretty lackluster when it comes to actually getting around to seeing if you need anything. Make up your mind on what type of establishment you want to be, don't just split the middle. \n\nI definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here, save that for Delux or The Grind or even Rehab. Zinburger tops this place.
