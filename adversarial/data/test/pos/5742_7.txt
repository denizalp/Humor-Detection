Had to write an update based on the service we recently had because it was just too insane.\n\nWalked in for breakfast this last Saturday morning and it took a good five minutes for the server to greet us because she was ringing up another couple - which is totally fine.  However when she did look up, she was annoyed and said \"I'll be with you in just a minute, maam.\"  \n\nLooks normal on paper, right?  Except this chick literally BARKED this at me - it was so over the top that the people she was helping actually turned around to look at me.  Gee, was it something I said?  I was just looking at the cakes, no big deal.  \n\nMy companions sat down to wait to get seated but I remained standing.  After the hostess was freed up she approached us and shouted \"Is there something I can help you with?\"\n\nUm... yeah... you could, you know, do your job and seat us?  There was no wait, no one else around the area - it was just so weird and uncomfortable and hilarious.\n\nOur waitress took our order in a timely fashion but couldn't crack a smile if you had used a crowbar on her.  Another waitress brought us our food and asked us if there was anything else we needed - to which we said yes - silverware.  It took her a good four minutes to scrounge up some silverware.  Isn't that the worst?  You sit down in front of your breakfast and it smells awesome and looks good and five minutes pass and you're sitting there like an idiot.\n\nAlso, what's up with servers \"trading out\" in the middle of a service?  That is so funny to me.  It wasn't like our waitress was off for the day - I could see her helping the table next to us.\n\nLong story short - my poached egg was watery, it took 20 minutes to get the bill from the waitress (our original waitress who returned to pick up the cash), no one said goodbye as we left, freaky little drill sergeant hostess...  and the worst part is that I know we'll end up back at this place for breakfast.\n\nUntil Sir Hobo's opens again.
