I've only gone to Courtney for my waxing needs and she is amazing. Her relaxed attitude and laid-back manner is just what I need when having another female take a gander at my lady garden. There's no awkwardness at all. This location isn't my favorite for the mere fact that parking is scarce, but the friendliness of the staff and the close proximity to my house makes this place worth it. I have bought groupons for Brazilian waxes here, plus they have a discount with your yelp checkin.
