This spot is amazing for their location right on the water, their brew selections, and their amazing food.\n\nI came here with a group of friends on vacation. Two beer flights were ordered. I personally didn't like the beers because I like my beers dark and heavy and the flights were light beers which taste like water to me.\n\nBuffalo Cauliflower was ordered to be share among us and it was really good with the ranch or blue cheese they served, I don't remember which one it was.\n\n I got the Smoked Brisket Dinner which was a 12 hour smoked AAA Brisket and came with brussel sprouts, creamy slaw, and buttermilk cheddar cornbread all on the side. Phenomenal. This is definitely something I'd recommend getting if you do come here for dinner. What they serve you is more than enough and it tastes very heavenly. I somehow finished everything and suffered through a food coma.\n\nThe waiting service is excellent. Very helpful, tentative, and liked cracking a few jokes left and right. It just made the whole dining experience a lot better which is how this place earned the fifth star in my books.
