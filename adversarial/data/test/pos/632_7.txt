This is a nice salon tucked away next to Albertsons. Both of my kids got haircuts from Sherri - she books her own appointments so I would recommend giving her a call or text. 702-339-9383. Excellent customer service and attention to detail. This location is clean with a positive vibe and clean restrooms.
