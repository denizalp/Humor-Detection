I've always wanted to try an oxygen bar. Actually, I've wanted to try a lot of things but my girlfriend usually isn't into that kind of thing or it's illegal. Or both. Fortunately an oxygen bar is something we both wanted to do without the need of liquid courage or mind-altering substances. \n\nAfter a long night and er... uh... morning\/ early afternoon of heavy drinking we figured this would get us back into tip-top drinking shape. \n\nThis place is a medium-sized booth with a couple people behind the counter. There were a couple seats available with a few other people at the bar. The girl hooked us up to the machine after explaining the science behind it and let us know she would be back for our massages after she finished with the other customers. I was pretty stoked it included a massage as well. \n\nThere are no scents for you to choose from except their mixture of rose and sky or something hippy like that. It's not an overwhelming scent but it is pleasant. I was just a little disappointed I couldn't switch between all sorts of unnatural scents like the drink menu at Sonic.\n\nAfter about ten minutes or so the girl hooked up this electric pulsing massager pad dealy to us. It looked like an iPod Nano with tentacles it supposedly breaks down scar tissue and it certainly felt like it. While the girl is attending to other customers you are in control of the iPod creature. When my girlfriend wasn't looking I would turn hers up to ten and see her back spasm out. It was awesome. \n\nAfter another ten minutes or so the girl came back with a handheld massager and went over our backs for a few minutes. \n\nThe whole thing took about 45 minutes which I am sure was a lot longer than intended.\n\nIt's an awesome combination of oxygen and a little massage. They do try to sell you their stuff but are not pushy.\n\nWe then felt we've had a rough afternoon so we asked the girl where the locals went drinking. But that's another review.
