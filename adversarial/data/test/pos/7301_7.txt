On May 21st, ICE celebrated it's 1-year-anniversary.  The way they celebrated this was by offering locals tickets for $1.10 ($6.60 after taxes).  Since the tickets are regularly $70, this was an excellent deal and a great opportunity to experience an ice\/acrobatic show.  I'd seen the signs for this as well as the actors running up and down the Strip promoting the show, so my interest was peaked.\n\nNow, having seen the show, my observation is mixed.  I really did enjoy the show, I found the theme entertaining and the acrobatics engaging, but this is nothing I haven't necessarily seen before.  Many of the acrobatics could be found in one of the small circus tent acts that come to your neighborhood from time to time (usually in a shopping center parking lot).  From balancing to leaps, many of the tricks in ICE are circus acts w\/ ice skates.  Much like watching Terry Fator do impressions without moving his mouth (doing ventriloquism), it's great to watch and can be amazing for a moment or two, but you do get the feeling you've seen this before.\n\nAnother issue is the seating.  It's a small theater, relatively, for what you are watching.  The people are crammed into the theater in a most lazy fashion with booths and tables setup like what you may find in a lounge.  The area inside the ice which can only be accessed by a bridge looked much more comfortable, though part of the action goes around this area so you may miss something.\n\nI wouldn't recommend bringing kids to this show.  It's a little too sensual in places and overall is not as flashy or exciting as La Reve (the only Cirque style show I've seen otherwise).  Cirque, ICE is not.  I stand by my statement that this is truly a circus on ICE.  Like another reviewer stated, if the Cirque people did take this act and make it \"Cirque\" then it may have a better overall appeal.\n\nLastly, the Riviera is an interesting choice for the location.  It's not dead center on the strip such as the Mirage or MGM where you find the true Cirque shows.  Moving down into this area, finding casinos like the Sahara or Stratosphere will also find you struggling acts in their respective theaters.  All of these casinos are too far away from the main part of the strip to attract that compulsive crowd that will walk in the day of the show.  Wohscigam, Matsuri, Gameshow Spectacular, Amazing Johnathan and others have all suffered from this north strip locality. \n\nThe ICE crew does do a good job of advertising themselves on the south part of the strip, however, so they are making up for this lack of exposure.
