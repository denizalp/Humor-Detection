It's all about the breakfast burrito here.\n\nOne of better finds for a quick meal\/snack\/drunken salvation that you can find on the strip in Vegas.  At $6, you really can't go wrong.  This puppy was good sized and came out piping hot.  \n\nBe forewarned, the salsa did have a weird taste...a sweet flavor, as if it were cut with ketchup.  Don't call me crazy, but the last time I checked salsa shouldn't be sweet, but spicy dammit!  At least it comes on the side.\n\nOutside of the BB, the rest of the menu seems to be hit or miss.
