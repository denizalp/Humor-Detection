This is the worst place ever do not come here I came in here at 8:30 PM this place closes at 9 PM I came in for a shave there was two Barbers just sitting lounging talking to each other. When they ask me what I need it I told them I needed a shave and they said they did not have time with 30 minutes to closing it does not take half an hour to shave I would not recommend this place to anybody bad customer service i'm pretty sure it's because I'm Mexican and I'm not white.
