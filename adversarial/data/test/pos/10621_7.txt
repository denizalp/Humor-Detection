We went to this place a few time in the past and I ordered the same menu, Vietsub Beef Sate Soup (no.1 on the menu), a few time as well. Of all those few occasions, the soup was not hot enough it was just warm, at least it was hot but not to the point where it should be really hot especially because they put raw beef meat into it. Ideally the soup has to be boiling in order to have the meat to be properly cooked. \n\nI spoke with one of the co-owner who told me that he will address the issue. The next time I went there, I order the same menu and still has to face with the same issue. I spoke with the other co-owner and his son (who is also working in the kitchen) about this issue and they seems welcome the issue that I brought to them. They invite me to come to the kitchen to show me where the soup is being kept in the big pot which according to them prevent them to put the fire at maximum level because it'll cause an overflow and told me that next time, instead of pouring the soup directly from the big pot onto a bowl, they will put a little soup onto small pot first to make it boiled.\n\nToday, I ordered the same menu and I can see that the soup is now much hotter. The co-owner son (whom I spoke with) was there and I approach him to let him know that his soup hotness level is much better than the last time. However, as soon as I asked him if he remember our conversation with him and his father, this guy quickly said that he don't remember and that his father is not there at the time and he left to the kitchen right away.\n\nI was surprised by his reaction. I was expecting that he would try to remember which event I was talking about (and asked me what was the conversation about) but instead, it seems like he was ready to say that he don't remember and quickly left me to end the conversation. My understanding of what really happened: he knew and remember about me but for fear of hearing\/facing a complaint, he decided to avoiding me by quickly saying that he don't remember and left me right away.\n\nThe irony in this story is, I wasn't planning to complaint, I was planning to praise them for doing a good job!!
