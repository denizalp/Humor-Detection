We came here to celebrate my brother and my husband's birthdays.  We will never pick this place again.  The service was SO slow and the food was mediocre at best.  We only had 1 red crunched pepper between 9 people.  The jar was passed back and forth throughout the dinner.\n\nSupremo Italiano - It was only thing good from this dinner but not the BEST pizza   (spicy Italian sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, provolone and meat sauce)\n\nChicken & Sausage Ziti - This dish was so watered down.  Tasteless!  HORRIBLE.  (chicken breast, mild Italian sausage, red onions, roma tomatoes and spinach in garlic cream sauce)\n\nLinguine Frutti di Mare - This dish was ok.  (shrimp, baby clams, mussels and calamari in spicy red clam sauce)\n\nSpaghetti with Meatballs - This was another tasteless dish.  The meatballs was horrific.  The meat was low grade and after eating it, I lost my appetite.  I don't think it was meat at all.  YUCK!\n\nWe waited 45 mins for tasteless dishes.....   And spend a couple hundred of dollars.
