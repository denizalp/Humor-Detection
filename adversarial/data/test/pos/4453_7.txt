This location is always always super busy. The baristas have always been very friendly and kind. \n\nThis morning I stopped by with hubby for a sweet pastry and a coffee before we got started on our daily errands on his day off. \n\nI knew there would be a wait, today just seemed to be specifically taking longer. And on top of that, the customers that were being served ahead of me, would not hurry up and pick up their items. I sat there and heard at least, every third name called two or three times. Which really upsets me, because I've been there when I'm in a hurry to get to work and have extra time planned to get my coffee, and me always planning ahead, I would plan for long wait times at the store. However, when I'm already waiting, then others are just not paying attention and their items are sitting at the counter, causing the barista to take time from making more drinks and call their name more than three times....aaarrrggg. LoL. Thankfully, not in a hurry today. But I was annoyed that those that are in a hurry are waiting and those whom don't care are even taking the wrong bag. Which DID happen to me today. My name was called with my pastry. Mind you, I don't have a common name. Then directly after, a mans name, Hugo, was called for his pastry which was exact same order as mine. I go to grab my bag and all I see is Hugo leaving the door in a rush. I look at the counter and his pastry bag is sitting there. Oh for goodness sake. LoL. All I can do is laugh. Not anyone's fault except the customers. Pay attention people. Other people's time is important. What if he had taken my bag with different item?  \n\nOh well, barista just promised me it was the same thing and loudly said, it's fine Hugo just took your bag!  So I laughed and walked away!!  WHAT CAN YOY DO?? LoL
