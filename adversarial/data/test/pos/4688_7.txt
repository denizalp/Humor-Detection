I'm a regular at this Fry's. The staff is always friendly, helpful and cheerful. I absolutely LOVE John, the cashier here. I will bypass another open register regardless if there is no one in line to jump in a line with several customers in John's lane. The guy is awesome! NO, I am not a stalker. He's excellent and is always in great spirits. As long as John is employed here, I will remain a loyal customer!! :)
