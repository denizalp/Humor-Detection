French restaurant at the Venetian. Heard rave reviews about thier breakfast and brunch... I went for brunch on a Saturday. Since I had already had my fill of pastries that morning.. I decided to skip out on their famous \"chicken and waffles\" and went with the trout instead.\n\nTrout ($25) - \"Truite aux Amandes\" was very delicious with the capers and potatos piled on top. I did find 1 little bone in my fish, but otherwise perfect! The fries that come with many of thier dishes are delicious and crunchy. I was able to steal a bunch from friends :)\n\nFriends ordered the \"Steak Frites\" ($33.50) as well as the mussel ($25.50) - \"Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde\". And I luckily was able to get a bite of both. DELICIOUS! You really can't go wrong with this place!\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for anything extra.. tabasco sauce, dijon mustard, jam, butter, bread, ketchup.. GREAT service.\n\nI MUST go back to get my chicken and waffles!!! I also heard great things about thier french toast :)\n\nPrices per dish around $20-30 for brunch :)
