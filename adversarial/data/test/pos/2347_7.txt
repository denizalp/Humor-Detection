I've tried a bunch of Mexican places in the city and I'd put Las Velas near the bottom. The place had nice decor, the chips were good, and the wait staff was nice. The food was typical Tex-Mex stuff. Nothing really stood out and some of my food was cold. I don't think I'll be back here, especially when there's a ton of other Tex-Mex places to choose from.
