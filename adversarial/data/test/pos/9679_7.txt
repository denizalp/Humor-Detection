All Aboard! Next stop Donutsville!\n\nOn a quiet Sunday afternoon, I  found Donutsville filled with a sweet surprise all the way to the last bite.\n\nI've been on a donut craze and wanted to explore their menu which had classic and non-traditional favorites. From donuts to cronuts and an extensive drink selection, we were impressed and somewhat overwhelmed with the selection. The staff was very patient while we made our difficult decision because they had over 32 donuts to choose from considering she mentioned they were almost sold out! \n\nThe date consisted of: \n\nGlazed red velvet cake donut - I'm not a huge red velvet fan but this donut made me see the light! What made me crave more bites of this donut was the crunch of the cake donut and the light amount of sugary glaze. The chocolate had just the right amount of flavor. They also have the same donut with coconut shaving if you feel like a nut.\n\nBlueberry cake donut - This is definitely my go-to donut since I had my first one in SoCal.  This one did not disappoint. Another highlight to was the lack of glaze which made the blueberry become the highlight. They offer it glazed for those craving the extra sugar.\n\nMaple bar - My childhood favorite and this was unique compared to the usual maple long johns. The maple flavor stood out with a light glaze covered top of the bar compared to a thick, hard, brownish coating of artificial sugar with a hint of maple on it.\n\nCherry glazed and filled yeast donut - What a surprise! Better than a jelly filled, you get a double dose of the cherry glaze on top with a generous dollop of cherry filling with real cherries in the center. The yeast donut was so light and airy and each bite was more addicting after the other. \n\nThe cost of the donuts were from $.89 (raised or cake), $1.25 (specialty & filled), $1.59 (fancy), $.25\/each $2.50\/dozen (donut holes) or 1 dozen mix $8.90 (extra for filled & fancy). They accept cash or credit card. \n\nMany customers ordered from their drink menu with a huge selection of coffee and smoothies drinks. \n\nWhat made this a five star date was the interior with ample seating, free wi-fi, water and friendly service. For those you who are in a hurry, they have a drive-thru. Open 7 days a week, they work hard from 5AM-8PM Monday-Saturday and 5AM-6PM on Sundays. \n\nBring your sweetie to Donutsville and share a donut or two!
