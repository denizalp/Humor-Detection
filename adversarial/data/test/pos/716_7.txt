My mom, three year old son, and I went here on a Sunday just because we were bored and we've never been to that mall before. Don't waste your time. The mall is on the verge of extinction. There's MAYBE ten shops open and the ones that are open are full of super pushy sales people. We went into Bath and Body Works and we had to leave because we kept being followed by sales people about all their specials and they were throwing samples at us. I've never had that experience at a B&BW ever in my life. \nThey have maybe four food places, 3 Mexican places and a Panda Express, along with two Mexican snack stands. If you speak only English don't even try to go to them, you won't be able to understand anything they are saying. \nI will say that I got a mango loco drink from one of the stands and it was very good, but I stood there waiting for them to call my number and they did, just in Spanish. Therefore I had no clue it was ready. \nIn overall, it's a very run down mall. \nOn the bright side, it's a great place to get exercise that's air conditioned.
