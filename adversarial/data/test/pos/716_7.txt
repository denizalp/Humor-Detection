What a shit hole! Came here for a drink and a burger and I never made it that far. It was almost 4 in the afternoon and I sat at a pub table. My sleeve got stuck to the table. A voice came from behind the bar that said. If you want drinks or food, you have to order at the bar as there were no waitresses. I got up and grabbed a couple menu's. Looked it over and said. Let's go, I've seen enough. I will only pass thru college towns from now on!
