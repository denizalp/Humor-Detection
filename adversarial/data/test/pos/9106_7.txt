Great! AFFORDABLE. Huge suite with a fab kitchen complete with coffeemaker, a jacuzzi whirlpool bath, a fantastic outdoor pool with the best music playing 24-7, and free wifi poolside and in the restaurants (if you ask really really nicely they might give you free wifi in your room, too).\nAbout a 10-minute walk to Paris. Not bad at all. And there is a 7-11 just outside if you want milk or something.
