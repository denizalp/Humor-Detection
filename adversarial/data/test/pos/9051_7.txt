Same Ol' - Same Ol'  What did ya expect!   Still, if you want some caffeine, and you need it now, here's the place to juice up right before making that visit to Good Samaritan Hospital down the block to see a hurting bro or sista!\n\nLocated just on the north\/west corner of 7 th and McDowell in a little strip mall of about four other businesses.  Next door to Einstein Bagels as their neighbor companion and moderate outside seating.  Indoor seating is slim at best and not much in the way for room.  Just a thin suite for the in&out feeling (Move it! Move it!)...\n\nLet's try and get excited about this Starbucks!----???----Well, there is a Bus Stop for local transit just in front!----That should lift your grocery bags some---or at least your duffel bag....\n\nDuring the day I felt like ordering a double-shot instead of getting shot at!  That's a positive!  (not sure about night though?...)
