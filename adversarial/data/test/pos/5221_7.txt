I wish I had the pleasure of having Carol and her team to clean my apartment. But instead, what I got was the following:\n\nMade an appointment on Monday, for a cleaning on Wednesday. This was over the phone.\n\nI tried calling back to confirm the appointment and time. I never heard back from Naturally Clean or Carol again. Not the day before the appointment, not the day of the appointment, and not the day after.\n\nEventually the number of rings to get the voicemail was shortened, as in I feel I was not only not being answered, I was actively being ignored.\n\nI would have appreciated a phone call back saying that they cannot accommodate me, as opposed to having me figure it out on my own. This was a move out clean, which is essential for getting a security deposit back... It's not something that can simply be put off. I went with Mad Maids instead and they were able to accommodate me on short notice. \n\nSorry Naturally Clean, but you blew it with this potential customer. I feel strongly about being treated like this and others should know too.
