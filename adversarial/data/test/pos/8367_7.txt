I had friends coming into town for an indulgent Montreal weekend and wanted to book one night that would be fun and delish but still veggie and healthy. I hadn't been to the new location yet but I'd really enjoyed the original and loved the friendly joyful service and felt like I could trust them to pull off a fun group dinner. \n\nI was not wrong! For $30 each plus drinks we had a crazy epic feast. Started with salads and crispy rolls and fried wonton style dumplings, super flavourful and fun bites. The showstopper though was the massive sushi boat. Why is it on a boat? Why isn't all my food served in a boat? \n\nThe group top favourite was the spicy jackfruit roll, and our least favourite were the ones with a pesto inside - the flavour combo freaked us out. There were so many to try from though, and so many left over, you couldn't be mad at having a few you didn't enjoy as much. \n\nDessert was delicious as well and our bottles of wine were affordable and tasty. \n\nThe big group table we were seated at in the back was great for getting a view of the whole spot, and still feeling kind of intimate with the group. It's a bit weirdly shaped though, I imagine the person sitting in the furtherest corner could feel a little left out. Not a big problem in our case as that guy in our group has a megaphone voice. \n\nEveryone I'd invited seemed happy, even though they'd started dubious, and the service was as warm and welcoming as I'd hoped. For vegetarians or pregnant people this place is a gift. We'll be back soon no doubt.
