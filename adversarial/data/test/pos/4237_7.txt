I had an hour layover and didn't want to kill time sitting in a restaurant waiting for food. I came here instead since well, I can still eat somewhat healthy while at a layover. \n\nI got the tomato, mozzarella, and basil melt and it was delicious. The bread tasted pretty good for airport bread and didn't tasted like it sat out for days on end. Their chips came with interesting flavors and their smoothies were freshly made. \n\nI'd stop here again if I'm at this terminal for food. It's very convenient. They also had an area for you to sit and desserts behind the glass to get to go for the plane ride later.
