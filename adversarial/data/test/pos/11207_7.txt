I have never in my life experienced such a shit stay, in Las Vegas of all places...\n\nLet's start with Vdara calling me,5 days before my visit, to tell me they oversold 2 bedroom penthouse suites. Keep in mind, I booked my room in November 2015, fast forward to today, March 2016. After expressing much disappointment and speaking with about 4 people who had NO idea what was going on, they graciously honored our 5 month old reservation. I'm not sorry that I booked a room far enough in advance to get a better rate. I don't believe for a second that Vdara \"oversold\" the 2 bedroom penthouse suites, but whatever...\n\n\nVdara never called me to arrange my airport transportation, I had to reach out to do it - keep in mind, this is included with my reservation. More run around, more crap to deal with. Upon speaking with the transportation department, I was also told that since we had a 2 bedroom penthouse suite, we would have access to the Aria Lounge. When I attempted to check in on 3\/17, nobody knew anything about a lounge. In fact, the concierge at Vdara, her name was Ara, was so incredibly rude and snotty, I can barely believe she has this job. What a joke. Nobody at the front desk knew what I was talking about. They all looked at me like I was an alien, it was so disrespectful. They kept asking me who I spoke with, whereas they should have been able to pull it up in their system. Then, they then told me that I must have booked transportation with  Aria. WRONG. the confirmation said VDARA Transportation department...\nTransportation also told me that we received 4 limo rides with our stay and I asked if we could use them for rides other than to and from the airport. I was told, \"absolutely, anywhere within a certain range\/mileage\". This was also apparently false. More misinformation. I dont  know what's so hard about getting everyone on the same page about your business. I really am shocked at the level of service and knowledge that we received. I'm actually disgusted.\n\nOur room wasn't ready when we checked in, of course we waited...\nAnd waited, and waited. We asked a few times how much longer, and they kept pretty much pushing us off. My friend finally leaned over the counter to look at our room #, since we had already been given the keys, without room #. We waited some more, and were told 15 more minutes and we should be receiving a call. They still have not called us, by the way. We checked out this morning. After we were sick of waiting for nearly 3 hours, we went up to our room, since we knew the room #. The room was ready, when they were going to call us ...well, your guess is as good as mine. We have yet to receive a call from Vdara about our room being ready. What a joke. This is how they were going to take care of us? \n\nMaybe staying at Aria is so wonderful that this place just fell totally short...\nThe room seemed pretty bare bones, with little thought and care put into this 2 bedroom penthouse suite that was supposed to be so wonderful. It was lack luster. We were also told, \"we will take very good care of you\" ...another lie wrapped up in more BS from Vdara.\nI would hope that management take this very seriously. I will NEVER EVER AGAIN give my  money to stay at this place. Poor management, rude staff, misinformation is a constant.\nThere are so many amazing places to stay that go above and beyond for you, do not give Vdara your business. Terrible!
