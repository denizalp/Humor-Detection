I have thought a lot before deciding writing this comment! I and my husband used to like going to this restaurant because we like the food. And in fact, I have tried to help the restaurant out by recommending it to many friends.We have not been back for a while. Last week, we decided to go back and it turned out so disappointed and shocked!!!!! I ordered duck soup noodle ( bun mang vit). My husband ordered egg noodle pork broth (Hu Tieu my). I usually point out the number for the waitress to make sure they understand exactly my order. After 15 minutes waiting for our food, we got something totally difference from what we ordered!!!! I told the waitress I did not order chicken with rice (com ga Hai nam). She  brought my food back to the kitchen and reported to the owner. I thought they were going to change it for me as other restaurants would do! But Nope! The owner came out with his waitress and a menu on his hand. He angrily asked me what I actually ordered and aggressively  started to coach his waitress right in front of us!!!!!! OMG, what a horrible experience we ever had at a restaurant in the States!!!! This is exactly what he coached his waitress in front of us:\" if the customer made a mistake on her order, she has to pay for it. If it was your mistake, I have to pay for it. And it costs me a lot of money. You know that...\" I was way to nice to accept eating a different dish. Not to mention that my husband order was wrong too!! He got rice noodle instead of egg noodles!!!! My husband did not finish his meal. He wanted to GET out of this HELL asp. \n\nI really hope that the owner of Pho Van read this comment and wake up before too late!!!! I have seen many of the same comments as mine on Yelp. Hello!!! You are doing business in a capitalism country where service is crucial to be survived! Your portion is much smaller than other Vietnamese restaurants in town while your price is much higher! And your service is HORRIBLE!! Good luck with your business!
