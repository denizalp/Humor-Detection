Second time here and I had the worst experience. 5 stars for the food, 3 stars for the price, and 1 for the service. Their service was so amazing when they first opened that they were so pushy but you felt like they gave you their undivided attention.\n\nThe only person who was nice to me was the gentleman in the supreme hat. The girls that were the servers ignored me four different times when I had questions or needed something, and asked for the bill! Soooooo rude they would just look at me and walk away. They didn't check if my boiler was too high or low because they were no where to be found. Keep in mind I came literally an hour before they closed and I stayed for only 30 minutes during the process. I think I'm going to go to swish or just go to the Yojie in LA. Terrrrrible service.
