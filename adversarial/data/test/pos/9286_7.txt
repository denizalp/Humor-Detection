Farm and Craft is a great addition to the Valley's growing plethora of healthy fast-casual concepts.  Will it blow you away?  Probably not.  But it will give you an opportunity to fuel your body with healthy, fresh food in a fun, hip environment.\n\nF&C's menu has changed over time for the better.  There are now plenty of options no matter what time of day you visit... from breakfast served all day, sandwiches, salads, bowls, etc... if you are open to eating healthy, you're sure to find something you like!\n\nI recently went for the Greek Quinoa Salad with salmon and avocado and it was delicious.  I also recommend getting an Arnold Palmer with their homemade lavender lemonade.  \n\nNote: F&C prices are a little steep... (almost double what you'll pay next door at Chop Shop), but the quality is high, the service is friendly and patient, and it's nice to mix it up a bit!  Hope to return soon for some avocado + egg white protein toast.
