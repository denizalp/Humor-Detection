I always love trying new places.  New Day Cafe did not disappoint! We stopped in around 2pm.  They close at 3 so we made it just in time!\n\nI ordered the TBA Melt.  Turkey, Bacon and Avocado! Perfect sandwich in my book! The bread was lightly toasted with lettuce tomato and cheese.  Delightful! Great and so flavorful! Plenty of turkey and the bacon was cooked just right - crispy but not burned.  It was accompanied with French fries.  They had these right also! Crispy and not a single soggy fry.  \n\nMy husband ordered the buffalo chicken wrap.  Being that he is obsessed with buffalo chicken wings, this was right up his alley! I had a tiny taste and it was fantastic! He loved the flavor of the buffalo sauce! He had the chicken tortilla soup on the side. Another hit! The soup was plentiful of ingredients that sang in harmony together! \n\nThe service was phenomenal! She was so friendly and our drinks never went dry! She was a smiling happy face the entire time.  \n\n I don't think we spoke much during lunch since we were too busy enjoying our meals.   That is a sign of delicious food! I can't wait to visit again!
