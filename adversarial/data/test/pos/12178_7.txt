Boston Pizza the restaurant gets 2 stars. Boston Pizza the biggest patio in the Yonge and Eg area gets 3 stars if all you're doing is drinking draft beer.\n\nIn the winter, apart from UFC fights, this place has always been pretty dead when we've been here to drink and watch a game.\n\nThe bathrooms are disgusting, the women's reek of urine and have paper towel all over the floor all night long and the men's have no paper towel starting at about 6pm continuing on until midnight (in other words no one checks those bathrooms ever, it seems).  \n\nIn the summer, spring and fall the patio in the back is great. There are couches, televisions and heat lamps. It's big and it gets some sun. There is also a small patio on Eglinton too.\n\nSome of their pizzas are pretty good but don't let anyone talk you into ordering the perogie pizza, it's bland flavourless and a waste of your time. I have no idea how this was recommended to us.\n\nIn short, they have a GREAT patio...don't go here for any other reason than that.
