First clue:  When you walk in the door, it smells like a hot Mumbai afternoon.\n\nSecond clue:  Accosted by beggars looking for leftover biscuits and gravy.\n\nThird clue:  Three sets of utensils later, and still nothing without fake egg caked on it.\n\nFourth clue:  The food.\n\nI actually liked Denny's too.  Franchisees completed ruined most of them though.  AVOID.
