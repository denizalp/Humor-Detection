Worst dining experience in 2009 for me.  Where do I start?\n\n1.  Sat at a table that had menus and silverware, but was obviously not wiped down.\n2.  They can't decide who our server is, 5 mins, 6 mins, 7 mins go by... and right at about 10 mins. someone is our server.\n3.  Menu says Sam Adams on draft.  Turns out, after a long wait, there is no Sam Adams on tap and we order again.\n4.  Potato chips were delayed because they did not have any pre-made chips.  They arrived with the main meal.\n5.  Kitchen staff was joking around, girls screaming, almost as if it was a little Spring Break party inside and everyone could hear them.\n6.  Calzone was ice cold in the middle.  Frozen ricotta cheese?\n7.  Pizza was burnt on the top.  No, you're not supposed to have those black circular splotches on the cheese.\n8.  Just a few casual apologies from the teenage waiter for the above.  No manager apology, no \"comped\" items, nothing.\n\nThis place seems like it was transplanted from some dopey college campus where every customer is 21 or under and just comes here to get drunk, regardless of food quality, service, and the time it takes to get food.\n\nNative New Yorker is a failure.  I regret not taking the other Yelp reviews more seriously, since NNY has a clear trend towards the low end of things, at this location and on Bell.
