As the weather finally gets warmer, a couple of things are guaranteed in the food world.  Patios open up, the backyard bbqs get cleaned out and the urge for ice cream begins again!\n\nVillage Ice Cream has been around a long time in the east end of Markham and last year they did a major renovation and update to their space.  From a regular dated parlour, the feel is now more upscale and hip to draw in the younger crowd and it works!  \n\nBut the big seller has always been the Kawathra Ice Cream which is one of the best commercial ice cream producers in Ontario.   They have pretty much all the flavours produced by them and all are fantastic.  You can get them in singles, doubles, in cones or cups and you can even get them in tubs to take home.\n\nSince the renovations they've also expanded the menu it seems and have added funnel cakes, waffles, churros, shakes, and even poutine!\n\nStaff is very friendly and welcoming.  Overall loved the changes they made.\n\nSolid 4\/5.  Time to welcome summer!
