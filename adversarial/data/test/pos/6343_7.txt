Cosmopolitan has added a great food hall with a medley of great restaurants from around the country!\n\nBlock 16 offers a variety of food options from donuts to spicy fried chicken.  Several places include Hattie B's, District: Donuts. Sliders. Brew and Lardo.  They conveniently are located across from the popular Hosteins on the 2nd level.  It's already a popular place to dine so the lines build up really fast.  Seating is located along each of the separate eateries as well as large tables and booths between Hattie B's and Lardo.  \n\nThere are so many great options but I would highly suggest Hattie B's tender plate with the mac & cheese.  Their medium sauce for the chicken is highly spicy so be warned that anything above will require a lot of water!   Don't forget your sweet treat from District.  They offer a great variety of fantastic pastries.  The Brûlée Cinnamon Roll is unique with it's density and crusted sugar topping.  Delicious! \n\nI am very pleased with the great selection of restaurants included in Block 16. If you're anywhere near the Cosmo, stop and enjoy!
