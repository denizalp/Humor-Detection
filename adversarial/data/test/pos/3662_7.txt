I was looking to purchase a vacation condo in Las Vegas and did not have much time to do so. Marissa worked extremely hard to find me exactly what I wanted and in a time frame that worked perfectly for me. She is very professional and definitely one of the best agents I've worked with. I would highly recommend her and plan on utilizing her services again in the future. Definitely a pleasure to do business with.
