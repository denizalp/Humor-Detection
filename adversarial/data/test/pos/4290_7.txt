I ended up at Rennick's due to running late, starving and not knowing where to go while staying at a hotel near the Phoenix airport.  Located in a rather nice Hilton, I was a little hesitant about the place since it rated only 2 starts on Yelp.  When walking in, I found Rennick's very spacious, it had a nice interior, low key vibe and an attractive bar with a lot of flat screens.  The crowd is definitely professionals doing business in Phoenix as well as a few locals dining in the area.  I was waited on by a wonderful waitress named Esther.  She suggested I try the chicken quesadilla (which was good!) and was incredibly pleasant and friendly when checking back periodically to make sure everything with my dinner was fine.  She really made it a nice dining experience.  I'd definitely come back here when staying near the airport and look forward to trying more selections on their menu.
