This place is extremely overpriced for a small take out place in a dirty little corner of the riviera casino.\nThe place is very shabby, and no one would ever want to sit and dine here.\nThe portions are really really small for the price they charge.\nThe plates in which they give the food out are made of very thin paper and all the gravy of my curry was sunk into it.\nTrust me no one would ever want to dine here if there was a choice.
