Came here with family for Sunday morning breakfast and as expected, it was busy. Plenty of parking though. Surprisingly we didn't wait too long until our party of 5 was seated. \n\nService was a bit slow and not that friendly. Our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters. \n\nFood was okay. I've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in California. I was a little disappointed with the quality and portion. I honestly wasn't full after having my meal, which is not a good sign for a great breakfast.\n\nMaybe I'm picky or all the great brunch places like Bill's and Evergreen Inn have spoiled me, but I expected A LOT more.
