I seriously love this place. It makes me love chicken. They use charcoal and the meat had a smokey flavor. They have a variety of sandwiches , wraps, salads and ribs. They have some desserts as well such as cheesecake. The sides all pretty good included the fruit, coleslaw, mashed potatoes. It is next to chipotle in the planet fitness\/Walmart parking lot. It is worth trying out. They have a small bar inside with BBQ sauce and ranch too!
