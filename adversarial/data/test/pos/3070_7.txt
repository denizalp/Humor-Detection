Apologies for this rant... The property looks like a college dorm now. When I moved in, I was the first to rent my apartment. It used to be a nice and clean property with nice finishes. It looks 10 years old now. It reeks of dog poop everywhere because the dogs use the restroom in the rocks of the tiny courtyards or simply pee on the concrete. The vomit in the elevators is a true story. It's pretty disgusting..\n\nI've decided to move out two months before my lease is over, but I'm still paying for the two months that my apartment will be vacant (I willingly did this with no argument because I understand lease terms). However, the staff has been so unhelpful during my move out of the place. I don't think they even know I'm leaving early so it isn't a \"well she's leaving type of situation\". Today I simply asked for access to a larger elevator to move my couch. My movers are on a time crunch (stressful day!!) and I was rudely dismissed because the leasing attendant was showing two potential residents around the property. I apologized for interrupting and I felt awful, but needed immediate assistance, which was very clear. The blatant lack of help or empathy was not appreciated. \n\nI am so glad to be moving out of here. It's extremely overpriced. It's filthy. It's next to the \"hood\" as another reviewer has mentioned. There was actually a mariachi band block party a few months back right outside of my window. To top it off, the people at the front office are SO rude. It's such a shame because two of the leasing office employees (Hawke and a super friendly blond girl) made me so excited to live here and are the only reason I give this place any stars.\n\nI am truly just so disappointed and it has made my decision to move so easy.\n\nPs the 292517 speed bumps that were installed in the parking garage make parking on the fourth level such a pain in the ass that I've started parking outside.
