Son of a Batch! \nWhy... why are you blocks closer to me now?\nEven worse, I'm at Ace everyday it seems picking up hardware for my new digs and it's so easy to pop across the street to the new space.  \nRawr.\nThe chocolate\/chocolate cookie is insane. INSANE. I'm not sure what gives it the cake-y yet solid texture, but whatever it is, it rocks. And on days when you don't have any, I cry a little inside. Truly. I did find a super solid alternative today though, the salty chocolate brownie. It's almost like the cookie in a fluffier, more square shape. I really don't think there's anything I haven't enjoyed. I have yet to take breads out for a test spin, next on my list once I make sure I've made my way though all the sweets. \nWhen I moved to Madison my friend Dan said Batch is best, and I have to hand it to him... he knows what he's talking about.
