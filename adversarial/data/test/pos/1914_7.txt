I decided to try this place for a good hangover breakfast today. The place is very small and there was no wait. The server looked a little greasy but was very nice. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage and hash-browns. The gravy is fantastic! The hash-browns tasted burnt, but didn't look like it....weird. The sausage link was awful!! I'm not sure what the problem was but it just did not taste good. My friend had the corned beef hash. It was very good. I will be back to try lunch, without hash-browns and sausage.
