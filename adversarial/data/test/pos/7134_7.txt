It seems this is the place hipsters go to get their pizza, kind of like how Gallo Blanco is the Hipster Macayo's.  They're so hip that they don't even put the name of the restaurant on the building!  That pretty much guarantees an overinflated Yelp rating, because a lot of hipsters have trouble thinking for themselves.  But I digress.\n\nIf you read my last few weeks' worth of reviews, you'd know that I have been eating a lot of pizza lately.  We are on a sort-of pizza quest.  I had high hopes for this one, and the menu actually looked really awesome.  I went with the Casanova, which is a white pizza with ricotta, dates, arugula, prosciutto, and pecorino.  I also had a ginger ale to drink.\n\nThe ginger ale was probably in the Canada Dry tier.  That means so flavorless that they're willing to serve it for free on an airplane.  The difference between a fountain and microbrewed soft drink is probably more profound for ginger ales than any other soft drink variety.\n\nAs far as the pie goes, the toppings were excellent.  Go here if you like the focus of your pizza to be entirely on the toppings, because the crust sucks.  It was a little too tough, and the flavor was worse than any other artisan pizza I've had.  This was not knife-and-fork pizza; it was pick-it-up-and-eat-it pizza.  That's how you know the crust is subpar.\n\nBesides that, the ambiance is a little too modern.  When I sit down for a nice handmade pie, I like it to be warm and cozy.  This place is trendy, with loud music blasting in the restaurant.  They need to dial it down a notch.\n\nOf all the wood-fired pizzas I have had in Phoenix, Federal was one of my least favorite.  Maybe better than Cibo, but not as good as Pomo, Bianco, or Il Bosco.  Or even Timo's flatbread pizza.  The chef might be creative, but without a good crust or a good restaurant, eclectic toppings become a bit of a gimmick.
