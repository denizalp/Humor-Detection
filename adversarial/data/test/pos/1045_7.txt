I've been chillin in Vegas from 93' till. I finally checked out the Drive-In this year. WoW!!! I can't believe it took me this long to check this place out.\n\nTwo movies yalls for dirt cheap!!! Get here early to get a good spot. Bring your own whatevers and kick back. I saw folks posted up with their camping chairs or what not. I saw this one cat trail in his boat and chilled on his ship with his family and dogs. Very family friendly. I love the atmosphere that this drive-in gives. \n\nBig Ups to the management. Thank you for Customer Appreciation Night! Three movies for FREE DOLLARS!!! $1 NACHOOOOOOS!!! I'm all over this. Get here earlier than usual on Customer Appreciation Night.\n\nSometimes the screen you're watching may be a little dim.  High definition screenings would be nice. All in all, this place is a definite must do.
