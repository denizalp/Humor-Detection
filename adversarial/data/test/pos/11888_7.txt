Oh sweet, sweet Brio.  I absolutely love this place.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Yes, it's a chain, but I definitely give props to a restaurant chain that makes food as delicious as Brio.  There are no negatives or neutrals about this place.\n\n+ Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.\n\n+ You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.\n\n+ FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.\n\n+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.\n\n+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!  It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.
