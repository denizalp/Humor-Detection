LOCALS! This is the place to be. Started coming here because of football and still do. Every Thursday, Sunday, and Monday they play that nights game on a big screen. They have pizza, salad,wings....just depends on the night. They have drawings for cash and other tickets for fun things to do around Vegas. Oh I forgot, wit your Hustler card (one time payment of $10 for locals) you get open bar any night of the week from 4pm to 8pm. \n\nNow that I have been a member over a year. I get perks every now and then like customer appreciation month, they loaded $250 bucks to my card that you can use on food and drinks and I got another $250 at Christmas time, perfect for me to use on out of town guests. \n\nOverall fun and friendly. \nOh....and there are strippers.....:)
