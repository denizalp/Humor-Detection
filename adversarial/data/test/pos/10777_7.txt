This really is your dingy neighbourhood bar. Which would normally be fine and worthy of three stars but the service is terrible if you're not a regular. Our group ordered a pitcher. When we wanted another one we had to go up and ask for it. When we finished the second, guess what? Yup, we had to go up and ask for our bill.\n\nThe place was nearly full by the time we left but the bartender\/waitress wasn't so busy that she couldn't make the rounds. Especially since this place is not very big. \n\nI saw some people had ordered plates of fries so I'm not sure what type of food they have or even if there is a full menu. They have some decent options on tap like Flying Monkeys and Buzz. They also have crap on tap like 50.\n\nIf you're into people watching then this would be the place for you. Many odd balls and randoms. There was a guy playing pool that was randomly blowing a whistle.\n\nP.S. If you can figure out what the tongs are for that are hanging below the men's washroom sink, let me know.
