We love this bar! Our bartenders were super friendly and funny and really were great with their customer service! A cranberry vodka was $15 so it's a little pricey but what can you say? It's Vegas afterall!\n\nThis bar is right in front of Omnia so it's a great place to sit and relax after you club.\n\nI highly recommend you stop by for the great service!
