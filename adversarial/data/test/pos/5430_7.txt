I only read Playboy for the articles & interviews!!! ;-) \n\nI would say PEEPSHOW was a fun adult Vegas show because Jackie and I have seen the E! Girls Next Door show a few times on TV. Holly Madison is the prettier of the 3 girls, albeit... all with a little help of a plastic surgeon. = \"Enhanced\"!!! \n\nWe went on a Monday night, so the 1000 seat auditorium was half empty. No worries. BUT it would have been nice if they allowed us to move down closer to the show. Our tickets were $75+ fees \n\nI had my expectations of PEEPSHOW, and it was cool with the Nursery rhyme spin offs. All in all, it was entertaining. We had our favorite skits and showgirls. (Girl on the pole and the girl on the bear rug was gorgeous)!!! BTW, Holly is barely in the singing and dancing part. She's kind of just a hostess through the show...\n\nYou get to see Holly topless (YES!) along with most of the other girls too! Gals, there are two guys that also share the stage if you're wondering....
