This is the mother\n\"The hair that I gave your server was in the food that was served to me. I pulled it out of my mouth. The hair was grey, not blonde! I then placed it on the tablecloth next to me to give to your server. We did not expect you to comp the entire meal. We did expect you not to try and charge us for the dish with the hair in it. Not only did you charge for the dish, you offered us a free dessert and yes, we ordered two. So what did you do? You gave us the cheaper one for $7.00 and charged us for the dish that cost $12.00. The right thing to do would have have been for you, the chef\/owner to come out, apologize and make it right. We have enjoyed our other meals at your restaurant and have recommended it to our friends. This kind of experience leaves a really bad impression and does not excite us to come back or recommend you. With such a small venue, it seems to me that you would want your customers be leave happy. As an aside, my dish was shrimp with baby bok choy as was my daughters. Both dishes came with broccoli (substitute) , with no discussion or notice from the server! Sincerely, the mother who had the grey hair in her mouth.\"
