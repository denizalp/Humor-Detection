There are two Bouchon locations at the Venetian Resort. This one is for the quick service bakery counter hidden underneath the back stairs on the casino floor. It is somewhat hard to find, but worth the effort.\n\nThe location mirrors the bakery shop located in Yountville serving a limited selection of French style pastries and coffee. There was no line when I visited which allowed me to get a blueberry Croissant and chocolate Macaron paired with an espresso with little effort.\n\nThe pastries were very good, although the blueberry Croissant was a regular one cut in half and filled with cream and fruit instead of baked in. The Macaron was very delicious with good flavor and texture. My espresso was done well and served in a tiny cup with a tiny plastic lid.\n\nThis is a great place to enjoy the famous Bouchon pastries without waiting at the actual restaurant. It is hard to find, but impossible to forget.
