There's a Lost Generation vibe here. The lights are low lit, the crowd is sparse but filled with characters, and the drinks are above top shelf. Ernest Hemingway wrote his novels here.\n\nBefore the sun rises, this is the place to visit if you're over the \"younger\" scene. You'll probably come to some type of epiphany if you go here alone. \n\nThis place specializes in a variety of different rums. I never liked rum before this place cause I got the grocery store I'm on a budget version. I get why Captain Jack Sparrow is asking why it's gone. It's just that good.\n\nSo hit this place up. If you don't have chest hair, you will grow some. If you don't grow chest hair, you will grow something afterwards, so go to find out what.
