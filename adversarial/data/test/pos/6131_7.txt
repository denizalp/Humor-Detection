Some people might ask: \"What's the point of Vegas without the drunk people roaming around the hotel, loud & annoying slot machines, and smoke?\"\n\nWell... All I have to say is... If you want that, just go to another other hotels on the strip.  This location is relatively close to the strip, and I love booking this when I am coming with a group of friends.\n\nI normally like to book the 2 bedroom suite when I come to this location:\n- 2 Bedroom (1 Master Bedroom with King Bed, Jaccuzi, See through shower; and the other bedroom have 2 full\/queen size bed).\n- Kitchen with all the gears that I don't know how to use\n- Laundry\n- Living room with pull-out sofa bed\n\nA 2 bedroom suite can comfortably sleep a party of 10.  \n\nPlease note that this location is a vacation resort, so they do not have room service daily.  But you can always buzz the front desk for service.  \n\nDefinitely a great place to stay at if you are traveling with kids and\/or want a relaxing weekend at Vegas instead.
