Do you want to partake in an educational tour while you have some brews?\n\nI drank two beers before that question was finished. \n\nSteam Whistle is a tasty pilsner which is brewed up in Toronto. Light and crisp. I'd say it's pretty similar to a Stella in fact.\n\nWe got a great tour by an awesome guide. Before we take off we had a drink or two which was part of your admission. During the tour you could win some more beers if you have a good knowledge of beer and were paying attention to what he said. \n\nSteam Whistle's origin is pretty cool, you can pick up kegs from the factory (or you can have them send it to you) and they're such nice people. \n\nAt the end of our tour we were handed tons of beer. Most of the people in your tour won't care for it. If you're like me, you might jump all over the extras. \n\nFun thing to check out in Toronto.
