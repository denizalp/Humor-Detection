Oh no, don't say its so!\n\nI've been meaning to get around to writing a review for Istanbul (it's one of my three go-to lunch staples when I need to be in-and-out), but I figured I'd eventually get around to it...   until today.\n\nFor those of you who haven't heard, Josh has been given 30 days notice by his landlord that his lease will not be renewed.  Apparently Midland Towers wants to let the 7-11 expand into this space, which would result in the loss of one of this city's greatest lunch spots.\n\nIs Istanbul inconsistent?  Yes.  Does the price vary depending on who serves you and what mood they're in?  Yes.  Does that matter?  No.\n\nAt no time have I ever been charged more than $10 for a standard Chicken Plate (chicken, wheat rice, salad).  What that represents is one of the best deals for a quality lunch in the city (sans Sree's and a few other discount offerings).  If you do yourself one favor for lunch, get your fill of this perfectly marinated, perfectly broiled (gyro style), perfectly shaved and crispy chicken breast.  Most times, the fiancee and I share just one of these massive boxes (see my photo), and we still end up stuffed.\n\nJosh goes out of his way to take care of his customers.  The regulars frequently get freebies and the newbies regularly get the star treatment.  Don't know what to get?  Let them know and they'll talk you though all of the hot and cold options (it can be a little overwhelming if you aren't familiar with the setup).\n\nMy favorites include:\n\nChicken plate (stated above)\nChicken salad\nCold plate (slew of vegetarian cold salads)\n\nMust adds:\n\nGrape leaves\nHummus\nand by all means, whatever hot sauce concoction they whip up for the day\n\nNo seating except for a two standing bars.  Most people, when the weather is nice, venture next door to EQT Park or similar.\n\nLets hope the city rallies behind Istanbul (a few groups already have) and Josh gets to either keep his current spot or is provided an opportunity to expand somewhere else.
