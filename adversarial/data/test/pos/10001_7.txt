This restaurant was formerly Jimmy's Krazy Greek Restaurant.  Decided to give it a whirl.\n   The menu is kind of limited, having about 10 items listed on it.  I had a craving for a burger, so I ordered a cheeseburger, that had a poblano green pepper on it.  It was very satisfying.  I liked that the sides that came with it were different than the usual fries, they had a \"potato of the day\" which were rosemary potatoes, and some steamed veggies, both were a nice complement to the burger.  \n   The ice tea I ordered was very bitter, I had a few sips, and wished I had stuck with plain water.  There were a few dessert items on the menu, but they were 7.00, too pricey.\n   The interior of the restaurant is bland, needs some decor to brighten it up.  Seeing as how it is a new place, they're probably still setting things in order.  \n   The owners seemed very nice, and were chatting with the patrons.  \n   There is a bar inside the restaurant.
