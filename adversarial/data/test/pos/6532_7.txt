Looking to get out of the University Area for a recent Panthers game, I decided to go to South End area and to Icehouse on South blvd.  This was the second time I've gone to Icehouse and I am more than willing to give this place my stamp of approval.  \n\nIs it the greatest bar of all-time? No, of course not.  Is it the worse bar in the world?  Far from it.  Do I like asking questions, and then answering the very same question I just asked? Of course I do.   \n\nFirst and foremost, I personally think  Icehouse has the best everyday beer deal in the entire Charlotte area.  They have $2.50, 14.9oz Stella Artois cans - EVERYDAY!  At most places you can't even get a 12oz bud lite bottle for $3.00!! \n\nI arrived around 7pm on Friday night, my date and I were able to secure a few seats at the bar in front of one of their two 50+ inch screens.  We put in an order of a dozen wings - 1\/2 honey bbq, 1\/2 hot.  When they arrived at the bar literally smoking hot. They were a bit small in size, but still looked very appetizing.  The wings were sauced perfectly - nice and wet, but not dripping with sauce.  The best part about the wings is that they were nicely charred which added a nice smoking flavor to them. Good sauce + nice smokey flavor + cold ranch = GREAT WING. \n\nWe also ordered the Castro Pizza as the Panthers game moved into the 3rd quarter.  I was a fan of the Castro, especially the black bean puree that was used as a base for the pie.  Do not order the Castro expecting a red, tomato base sauce.  None-the-less, I found it to be bursting with flavor and freshness.  One could easily tell it was made to order.  The veggies, cheeses, and black-beans united in formation in favor of flavor!!\n\nFinal thing I have to mention...They have great service here, especially the male bar-tender that was serving my friends and I.  We affectionately referred to him as \"Super Bar Tender\".  We meant it in the highest regard - he was everything you want out of your bar tender - quick, efficient, had some personality but didn't bug you or seem like he was working you for a tip.  \n\nSo here's to you Honey BBQ Wings, Castro, and Super Bar Tender - keep up the good work, cheers!
