I really really wanted to like this pizza joint. Right when we walked in the little old Italian owner greeted us and continued his pacing around singing in Italian. The restaurant was empty, although this doesn't always mean bad food, this time it did. We ordered their \"House Specialty\" pizza which was thin but not too thin, olives, raw white onion chunks(I think they attempted to cook them but they were very raw) black olives, tomato chunks, very dry sausage bits and canned mushrooms. We also got the meatballs. Took everything home to dig in, upon inspection of our order we got two small meatballs for 6 bucks. I wouldn't be adverse to that price if they were amazing, these were not. Very bland and over cooked. The pizza crust was good but needed salt, that was the best part of the pizza. Every bite was dominated by the slimy huge slices of canned mushroom. If you're charging 17 bucks for a pizza please use fresh ingredients. They got the one star for the funny little owner and a crust and sauce that had potential. Everything was just extremely BLAND. We had to use salt, garlic, Italian seasonings, and Parmesan cheese just to make it edible
