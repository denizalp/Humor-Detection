The portions were better than I expected. Let's be honest here, I'm a cheapskate, so I wasn't clammoring to try this place when I first heard it opened bc of the pricing. Yes, it's basically an uncut maki roll, but it's much bigger in diameter. If you were to cut these, you wouldn't be able to fit one piece in your mouth. I don't even know how they roll it with all the stuff they put in it. These guys are pros.\n\nAnd they have this cool machine that puts the rice on your nori or soy paper on in seconds! \n\nYour order goes down the line Chipotle-style and the guys assemble your burrito. Like I said, it's a generous amount of fish. We went on their anniversary day to take advantage of the BOGO special and I was also surprised they didn't skimp on the portions on sale day. Even at full price, while still pricey for lunch, is a much better deal (and better tasting) than supermarket sushi. And let's get real here, the sushi at Whole Foods market isn't that great and it's freaking expensive! Dollar for dollar, this place is more worth it. And more filling than I thought!\n\nAuthentic Japanese sushi this is not, but those purists with a stick up their ass can go eat somewhere else. This is America and this is American style sushi, and yes it's good. If you want \"real sushi\" made by a \"real Japanese chef\" and pay $50+ for a tiny meal then be my guest. If you're not one of those annoying purists, then come and give this place a try.
