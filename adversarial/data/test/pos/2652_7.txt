This is Undefeated. Vegas style! If you have been to an Undefeated chapter store in Los Angeles, this store is pretty similar. I think it looks exactly like the Silverlake shop. The layout is very simple. Left side is kicks, right side is apparel.\n\nShoe-wise, they have the typical Nike-Jordan Urban account, but occasionally they will have some limited stuff that will sell out quick. Adidas, Puma, Reebok, and other brands are also sold here. It is slightly better than the Nike Store in Caesar's Palace, in terms of classic Nike sneakers. The selection isn't the best, but they have all of the current Urban account styles. \n\nTheir collaborations and store goods are the main draw. A lot of casual customers get their sweaters, tees, and hats with their store logo. I saw their nice BAPE collaboration, but the items ran over $80 for shirts and hats. Typical BAPE-overcharging. They have a lot of sneaker accessories, such as cleaning items, laces with lace locks, and even a Mag-lite in case you want to club someone to death for stealing your sneakers.\n\nThe people who work here are nice, but I expect that out of all of the chapter stores. They run things quite differently at Undefeated. It is good for a non-intimidating experience.
