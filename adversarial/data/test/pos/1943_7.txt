Stayed here for about 4 days while visiting. This place looks better than it actually is. We reserved a single room-double beds. Despite that it looks kinda decent, I was MUCH less than impressed with this place.  It was like a domino effect of things going wrong....\n\n#1- My room was not ready upon arrival. This turned me off because I had called them previously to let them know i'd be arriving early and I was assured an early check in. Got there after a long morning at the airport and the receptionist told me that the room wouldnt be ready for another 1.5-2 hours and pretty much waved me off to go find something to occupy my time.  So I went to Yorkdale Mall, (review coming on that too) hung out a lil while, I came back 3 hours later and the room STILL WAS NOT READY. At this point I was PISSED. A new rep was a lil more sympathetic, but told me that she's sorry, but they need another 30-45 mins. So I sat in the lobby steaming like a kettle till it was ready. \n\nThe room was \"aiiiight\". It was clean n but much smaller than I expected--whatever. I was so tired I put my stuff down and passed out on the bed. \n\n#2- Housekeeping room service loves to come ridiculously early. She came to come clean the room before 7am? Are you serious?? I told them to come back. Around the afternoon, I left all the dirty towels in the tub as instructed and I left my room and put the \"please service\" sign on the door. Went out n had a blast with my friends and came back to my room at 11pm. Guess what was still in the tub? Yup! Those same dirty ass towels in the tub. I was on FIRE. I called housekeeping, and BARKED on whoever answered the phone. She apologized and then told me that the housekeeping person said I refused to have my room cleaned so they left it.I asked here WHY they came so early, she said it was probably because the person across from me had an early check-out...........\n\nNeedless to say, she brought up new towels on the spot,but couldnt clean the room. So now we're showering with a heap of dirty towels in the bathroom corner. \n\n#3- Water pressure in the shower is weird. It comes n goes as it pleases. The maintenance guy came up to look at it and said \"Oh its probably because alot of people are showering at the same time.\"  #blankstare    -_- \n \n#4- Elevator stopped working, we had to walk down 11 levels to get to the first floor.  \n\nMaybe the Crowne Plaza just had it out for me on this trip, Idk. But I know I will never stay here again unless its a free visit.  The only thing i liked about it was the free wifi and that it was close to the highway.  I hate the fact that they dont have mini-fridges in the room and no microwave in the WHOLE hotel. No snack machines, just sodas... I mean..... what rubbish. I give 5 stars to having all the staff fired and new staff rehired.
