This is one of this one of this places that needs to be reviewed by every client. My wife started attending this place for about three weeks now, and she is ecstatic about it. My wife has never done any sort of weightlifting in her life and she has the coordination of a two left-footed seal. I was afraid for her safety, and the poor people who will help her in the gym. She comes home the first day, and she told me that she almost passed out. I was thinking that this girl would not come back. She did and through the intensive basic training that they have given her, she could now do pull ups, push ups, and squats with relative ease. They also have a nutritionist that guides the clients with the right food to help them work out like horses in the gym and stave off their tendencies to eat like pigs at home. The prices are also better than most, if not all, of the other Crossfit in town. Before I forget, the people that runs this gym are extremely educated, which comes out when one converses with them. Lastly, the people who come here are also extremely friendly. Once they are done with their grunting and yelling, they are quite affable and very helpful with one another. My wife has been really happy with this place and her body has transformed.
