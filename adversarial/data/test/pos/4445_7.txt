A mediocre area sushi option.  \n\nWhat seemed promising at first - bright, white, spacious, hip and featuring iPad ordering - was quickly deflated like a dollar store birthday balloon on arrival of some ordered items.\n\nFirst, I fond the iPad ordering convenient and pleasant. It allows me to take my time in deciding what I want and mix & match my own lunch. A normal bent box just doesn't cut it when you get unwanted items so this flexibility is appreciated. I don't know why every restaurant isn't doing this yet.\n\nThe soup didn't come first - just as well as it was a wonton soup with bland broth. With iPad ordering it's inevitable that the fastest items made will he out first... but it's soup. It's likely already made and sitting in a warming pot. \n\nNext was a great shrimp tempura followed by a very non-tempura \"onion tempura\". The menu image tricked me into thinking I'd get a hand battered onion ring, but no I got a substandard cooked-from-frozen Costco variety plain breaded onion ring. Served with ketchup no less. The clue should have been the fries included in the tempura section of the menu. However the picture and description were enough to convince me I was getting a \"jumbo Spanish onion\" ring in tempura batter, not a microscopic premade onion ring.\n\nMost of the other dishes were fine. Nothing epic here. For a sushi place I expected more varieties of sushi and maybe even some sashimi, but not a single slice of fresh sashimi could be found.\n\nThere are other interesting items I may try if I return. ..none of which appear Japanese. There's a nice looking Thai chicken satay skewer and some Thai curries and pad thais. Korean spicy beef and some szechuan chicken dishes.\n\nBut for these I usually pick a restaurant that does Thai or Chinese cuisine.\n\nYour mileage may very, I saw lots of satisfied customers here.
