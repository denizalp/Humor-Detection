Being next to a college campus, one might consider giving the taste of this restaurant's food a pass.  After all, it is a step up from Top Ramen, a staple in any college dorm pantry.   But is it really better?   Not at all. \n\nMy entire hospital floor ordered a plethora of items off their menu.   Too much of the food we ordered were hit or miss.   In fact, throwing a dart, after being spun around and blindfolded, at a target 50 ft away would still result in hitting the mark more often than you would get something delicious and\/or edible here.  \n\nThe egg flower soup- no good.   It starts bland, and finishes with a weird aftertaste in your mouth.  This is the opposite of enjoying a good wine tasting.  \n\nBbq spare ribs- Dry.  What it lacked in flavor it more than made up in the red food coloring it was doused in. \n\nShrimp in lobster sauce- sub-average but decent sized shrimp and edible. \n\nSesame chicken - Dry.  Hard.  You could not stick a metal fork through them if you tried.  If you manage to bite into one, you might discover a hint of sweetness to the chicken. \n\nChow fun-  Not so fun if you ordered this. \n\nTeriyaki combo plate- I heard from co-workers that it was decent. \n\nEgg rolls, crab Rangoon-  Meh.  \n\nI give them a star for being friendly over the phone and ordering was easy.   Being open until 4 am is helpful for us late night shift employees.  If only they were worth ordering from.
