4 stars for the killer happy hour special daily.  All tequilas and rums are half price making it very easy to make your way through the list and trying some I've never had the pleasure of tasting before.  The only food we were able to try were the nachos which were delicious!  Note to self- make a reservation because the whole joint was reserved by 6 pm on a Saturday night.
