I love MIllie Creperie! Cleary I am not alone in this sentiment, either. It's kind of in an obscure location, tucked inside of an alley, but the treasure hunt for this store is totally worth it. It's small but there are enough tables to settle down in. I usually get take-out because I like to eat in the comfort of my own home, but a lot of people just mill about inside \/ outside on the tables too.\n\nThe mille crêpe cakes are divine. So fluffy and soft. I like how when you sink your fork in the layers squish together and merge into a gorgeous mess. They run out of new cake flavours pretty quickly- I wanted to order the champagne one but by 8 pm it was gone. I also like their original crêpes; they're topped off with delicious ice cream!\n\nThe chefs are so lovely, and they gave us a really cute Millie Creperie take-out bag. Will definitely come back!
