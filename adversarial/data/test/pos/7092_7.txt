For my last Vegas trip (two weeks ago), I got into town really early. Like at 8am haha. I was sad that Fat Tuesday doesn't open until 10am. So I decided to get other drinks before it and waited for 10am to come so I can get a Fat Tuesday. I'm a small girl and usually only get the yard size with an extra shot for $14. Super cheap :). Yum yum yum! My favorite favor is the blue one! I can't remember the name right now but it's so good! Highly recommended! If you are not sure what flavors to get, ask them for some samples :). I love the superman combination!! The hurricane flavor is also good too!\n\nI usually get about two fat Tuesdays a day because it's so good and I love just being able to walk the strip and drinking it. \n\nThis is the number one place you must go to before you leave Vegas! For anyone that leaves Vegas without trying a Fat Tuesday, OMG.. You're really lame! :)\n\nOh also! My favorite location is inside planet Hollywood. :) \n\nNow! Go to Vegas and buy one! :)
