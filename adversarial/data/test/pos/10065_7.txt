This location has been the biggest I've seen, whenever I go here I mind my own business. I just wish the stretching area is a bit bigger because people tend to hog up the space by laying down and going on their phone. \nMy favorite thing about this place is the classes, I'm in love with the Zumba, hot hula, and yoga instructors. They get you so pumped up and ready to sweat! They all seem like they love their job. \nLastly, the pool. Do not, and I repeat DO NOT go in the exercise pool. It's always warm and full of sweat because people don't know how to rinse theirselves before getting in the pool. I swear that pool is saltier than ocean water.
