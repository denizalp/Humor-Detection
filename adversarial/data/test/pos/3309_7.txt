I've given this location many chances since it first opened and it's still completely hit or miss. Before the area developed more there wasn't ever much of a line, yet my order still at times came out wrong. Now that more homes have been built around the area this location has the usual...wrapped around the building long lines, and my order still isn't always right. I order a simple Grilled Cheese and ask for grilled onions and end up biting into nasty hard char pieces from the grill. I ask for no lettuce and sometimes get extra. I ask for regular fries and sometimes they come out overcooked\/black. It's a bummer because In N Out is known for being consistent and I love eating there often. When this location does get it right it's absolutely delicious! I just wish they were consistent with other locations in town. The inside is clean and there's plenty of parking in the lot. The dining area outside is dog friendly.
