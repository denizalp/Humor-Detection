Tacos! Isn't that what it's all about? I got the three taco special, which came with a choice of a side. The black beans were excellent. I liked that I was able to switch up the type of tacos and of course, I chose three different types. Sorry, I can't honestly comment which ones were which, or how each were. Why? It took forever to get our six tacos! \n\nThe service wasn't good. We were there on a weekday during lunch. It was packed! The waitress seemed to be the only wait staff in the entire restaurant. She was literally running from table to table. We ordered the chips and salsa (free with a Yelp check-in) and guacamole. When she placed the chips and salsa down on the table, in a quick hot second I turned my head to ask about the guacamole and she was gone, I told you, literally running from table to table. \n\nThe atmosphere is a college sports bar with an Americanized Mexican twist. Most people were sipping on margaritas early on in the day and it was already pretty loud. Not a place I'd recommend for kids.
