I heard about this store a few months ago but never made the drive to The store closest to me. I was very excited when I found out that we were getting on in Goodyear. I showed up for the grand opening with a lot of other people. Unfortunately I was too far back to get the gift bag they were giving away but I did get a coupon to use that day. I spent a lot of time in the store for two reasons. #1 there was so much to look at and #2 I couldn't decide what I wanted to buy, not because I couldn't find anything but because I wanted everything. I really didn't see anything I didn't like so this is going to be a dangerous store for me in a good way :)\nI am sure that I will be doing quite a bit of Christmas shopping here for my family and friends. Oh I forgot the most important thing-the prices are super reasonable too!
