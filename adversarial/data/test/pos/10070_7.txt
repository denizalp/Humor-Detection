I decided to try out a new moving company for my most recent move. Rent-a-Son had such a high rating and so many good reviews on HomeStars, I was initially suspicious about who wrote them. That being said, there were barely any negative reviews (and they weren't even that bad) so I felt comfortable trying out the company. After my experience, I can completely understand why there are hundreds of 10\/10 reviews.\n\nAmanda coordinated the move and was really personable and helpful. Likewise, the two movers who showed up the day of the move were amazing. They were extremely efficient, energetic, and had positive attitudes. Plus, they ensured all my furniture were protected with blankets, and they even put down runners so they wouldn't track dirt into my place.\n\nThe experience was a huge difference from the move prior, and I am so glad I decided to hire this company.
