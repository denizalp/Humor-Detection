Amazing place. Great Wynn Burger with chocolate shake & fries, it's Steve Wynns Vegan Dish, it's Great, Delicious, filling, Scrumptious and HEALTHY, we both can't wait to get back and have another. The place is busy, bustling with people, high energy and fast service. You have a Nice view of the \"Race & Sports Book\" to watch, Put in a bet and watch the HORSE RACING! Made money on the Horses, while Eating.$$$ It's a FUN PLACE With a Good Healthy Choice Selection of food on the Menue. Wynn Always has Vegan & Vegetarian Dishes on All His Menues in ALL His Restaurants for HEALTHIER FOOD  Choices. We absolutely Loved the WYNN VEGAN BURGER & Chocolate Shake while watching the Races, It was delicious, But portion Small. It can get pretty NOISEY and loud, But the Vegan Food & Drink is YUMMY & WELL WORTH IT. EVERY BITE & EVERY SIP IS DELICIOUS, Also reasonably Priced. A Great healthy Meal, Only wish Shake & Burger Where BIGGER!!!  Located At \"WYNN\".
