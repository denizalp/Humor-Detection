The brakes on my 92 Mercedes 500E were squealing. \nIt was a Saturday and I didn't want to risk waiting until Monday, so I took a chance, based on Yelp reviews and called All Imports.\nI'm glad I did.\n\nThe owner, Sam, who is a very charming guy, told me to come in and he'd take care of it.\nI dropped the car off, took a 2 hour walk up and down Spring Mountain (discovering many hidden asian gems in the process by the way), and when I came back the job was done.\n\nPrices are not exactly cheap, but more or less the same as other non-dealer Mercedes shops. And the brakes are working beautifully.\n\nI'll be back.
