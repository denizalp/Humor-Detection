Left in tears. For my 21st birthday I had reserved my reservation two weeks ago. Our table was ignored, the service was slow... Then the hostess told another server I never had a reservation?!? That's funny because SHE CALLED ME TO CONFIRM AND I CALLED TWO WEEKS AGO!!! And as I watched other tables receiving more attention and getting fire works and ice cream sundaes I was completely forgotten. There was only two other tables and mine in the whole establishment! No one came to check on us. The manager gave me a gift bag with a few things and just said sorry... :( so upset.
