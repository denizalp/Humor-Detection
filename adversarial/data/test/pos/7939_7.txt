Carson Kitchen has been on my radar from the moment they opened and I was excited to give them a try for my good friend's birthday dinner. We arrived around 5:30, and they were just on the cusp of getting busy, so it was great timing. \n\nThe entrance is a little obscure and there are two doors right next to each other, so it's a little difficult to figure out which one is the one you can enter through. We approached and tried the door and when it didn't open we walked around to the other side of the building and then had to walk back and realized there was another door right next to the one I had just tried. When we walked in, the hostess mentioned seeing us miss the door and walk around and I kind of wondered why didn't she didn't come out to let us know instead of just watching us wander around the building. I saw this same thing happen to a number of other customers as well, so they might need a sign or something. \n\nOnce seated, our server was very attentive and friendly. We quickly ordered some cocktails and sodas and he let us peruse the menu for a while. There aren't a huge number of menu items to choose from, but almost all of them caught my eye, so we decided to share a number of items amongst the group. \n\nItems selected: \n-Cocoa espresso NY strip steak \n-Devil's eggs with caviar and crispy pancetta\n-Crispy chicken skins with a smoked honey dipping sauce\n-Beef Wellington empanadas\n-Butter burger spicy tater tots \n\nEverything we tried was great. The strip steak was perfectly cooked and had a nice rich flavor. The deviled eggs were a highlight of the meal. They were rich and a great twist on the typical deviled egg. The chicken skins were very rich and I'd recommend sharing these with a larger group to save you a stomachache. The Beef Wellington empanadas were very tasty, although I did feel a little more sauce would have enhanced the dish quite a bit. The butter burger was very basic, so I probably wouldn't order this dish again. \n\nService was attentive and their cocktails were solid. I look forward to trying out the rest of their menu soon.
