\"Is that supposed to be Storm?\" Kay asked me in a hushed tone as the feature we thought we paid for this morning began to unfold. \n\nThat's when a chill climbed up my vertebra like a spider. \n\nWe were at the wrong screen! We were watching \"Belle\" instead of the latest X-Men installment! Great Scott!  \n\nWe were told to to go the last door on the left. \n\nWell, we saw a sign that said \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" and thought we went in through the correct entrance. I could only see an EXIT sign past the digital marquee. \n\nThat it until our instincts proved correct, and we hastily exited the wrong screening room and went around the corner. \n\nSo yes, the place is poorly designed and misleading. \n\nLuckily we didn't miss too much of the newest installment of Marvel's mutant saga, and being a comics fan, I was able to fill Kay in on any story gaps. \n\nTo boot, I scratched my leg on the the corner of their sharp, unpadded, armrests that are so hard that they feel as if they were made from petrified wood. \n\nAt least it didn't rain this time.\n\nP.S. We only came to this theater since it had the earliest showing of the day, and we had things to do later. \n\nP.P.S. The sound, picture, and service are acceptable.
