My daughter loves the red velvet pancakes at IHOP so we took her for a treat. It was very slow and maybe a handful of people inside eating, but even then our service was so slow. The waitress looked miserable. I ordered just basic scrambled eggs, blueberry pancakes and bacon. It was ok, but nothing that would keep me coming back. I do t think we'd be back again except maybe for my daughters birthday breakfast or something.
