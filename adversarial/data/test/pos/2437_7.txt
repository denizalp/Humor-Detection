I don't know what to think. This place is very up and down. It's good and then it's great and then it's not good. It really all depends WHO your sushi chef is....\n\nSuccess in the ayce sushi world should be consistency, and that's one thing that this place lacks. I've been here at least 6 times over the past couple of years and I still go because of the convenience of this place and when it's good, ITS REALLY GOOD. \n\nSome sushi chefs do HEFTY rice, some don't. I was obsessed with the aria roll the first couple of times I went here,and now I steer clear of it bc the presentation and quality has gone down. Not sure why. Crispy rice use to be really good, now it's not, the crispyness of the rice varies. Hand rolls have gone from great last week, to stomach ache and heavy heavy rice this week. \n\nI do like the fact that they offer tapas AND sushi which keeps this place unique. Very wide menu. And it's right off of the strip, it closes at 2:30am, so it's convenient for drunk people. \n\nOne time, the server spilled water right on my phone, and their apology was a $5 gift card. \n\nAll in all, just indifferent about this place. Really have to find out what the good sushi chefs name is, because that's the only time I would probably come again.
