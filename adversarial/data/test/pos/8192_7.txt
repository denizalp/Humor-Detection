The city of Scottsdale does a great job keeping this park looking amazing all the time.  They have lots of fun things to do at this park. I personally like going on the train with my nephews and nieces.  It is so cute when their faces brighten up when we are on the train.  :) \n\nThe cool thing about the park is that they have two playgrounds. The first playground  is one of the biggest playgrounds around town.  It has a least 3 or 4 slides, a couple of swings, towers, ladders and monkey bars.  The other playground is in the middle of the park and has a western theme.  It has one slide, a pretend jail and a wagon that you can play on.  Also they have a model train museum that you can get in for a couple dollars. It pretty fun to walk down all the aisles and see the old model trains.    \n\nLooking for a fun park to go to when you come into town?  You should check out McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park.  It is one of the best parks in town.
