I was in the Army, but coming to an Air Force base is always pretty cool. I was here for a few days for a conference and while it may not be for everybody, I thought it was pretty cool. I've always loved military jets and if you're in the area you'll see them flying in the mornings and early afternoons (I wasn't here at night, but I assume they must fly at night SOMETIMES).\n\nFrom what we got to see while we were here there are squadrons of A-10s (the Army's favorite AF Jet), F-16s, and F-22s...I think I also saw some F-15s, but maybe not. I didn't get to see any of the big planes, and to be honest, I don't know what else is located here. \n\nThey do a lot of air to air and air to ground training here at Nellis and out in California. Maybe it gets old for the people that live out this way, but I could watch these planes all day.
