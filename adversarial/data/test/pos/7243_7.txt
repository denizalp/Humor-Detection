$17 !!!!!!!!!!!!! For 1 jalape√±o chingadera (that's Spanish btw) .........apparently it's happy hour until 8pm we were here @ 7:26 pm and she charged me full price !!!!!...BEWARE of Server JILLIAN !!! Check your receipt for me it was too late I looked when I got home .......Thursday night it's apparently salsa night but I didn't stay long enough I went to brio for happy hour were my drinks were $5 then came here to meet with friends and I was shocked and glad that I drank elsewhere . The drink was overwhelming with a ton of sugar which gave me heartburn :\/
