I saved my 400th Yelp review for this Phoenix gem. This is one of the first places I drag out-of-towners... usually for brunch. And when I have brunch at Welcome Diner, I usually cannot resist ordering the same thing, the Holy Puerco. Pulled pork, cheesy grit cake, pure heaven.\n\nThe best thing about this place, especially if you get one of the rare seats inside the luncheonette, is that it feels like you own the place. The staff cooking and carrying on are an arm's length away. I love the communal \"Hurricane!\" cheer that resounds whenever somebody orders one of these fresh-squeezed fruit cocktails. Welcome Diner is one of those places that the ambiance overwhelms you so suddenly that you are drawn in to the fun atmosphere... and though you may not be a morning drinker, you can easily be convinced that it's time for a beer or cocktail with breakfast.\n\nI can't say enough about the wonderful poutine here. Other places may just smother their fries in brown gravy, but this place used the white breakfast sausage gravy. Although the cheese curds get a little lost, this is a great way to eat poutine! I also like their choice of either sausage gravy or mushroom gravy if you order the biscuits and gravy (or, do half-and-half, if you must).\n\nThe crowd that dines here is cool, the staff is righteous, and the food is spot on. If you want something funky and delicious and scratch-made, you would do well to pound a path to this wiggity-wack little diner in the middle of a dusty old Phoenix neighborhood. Off the beaten path, as it were...
