Sweet Dees is making these, who am I to disagree?!\n\nFirst off, every time I hear this shop I think of this song but what could be more fitting than a bakeshop that is as dreamy as SweetDee's?\n\nNestled in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, SweetDee's brings on innovative sweets, creative drinks and of course millennial staple foods. SweetDee's is located at the base of a nice apartment complex that gives you a small french bistro vibe when you see the outside awning accompanied by the cute quirky chairs. Tons of free parking whether on the street or in the large parking lot. \n\nInside, SweetDee's brings a lot of gorgeous pastels with sleek white details. The ceiling has a gorgeous floral print and fun, unique art on the walls. Inside is small and adorned with a few small chairs and tables but lets get to the best part...the GOODS!\n\nSweetDee's has cruffins! Yeah, you heard that right, its if a muffin and a croissant had a delicious baby. The outside is flaky while the inside is soft and even has a surprise cream filling. It was amazing! They also put on a lot of themed events, some examples are Harry Potter Day, Wes Anderson Day and I'm sure there will be even more in the future. I also tried their apple cold brew, all of the syrup was made from scratch and it made my cold brew even better. The Everything Bagel Platter was a deconstructed Lox Bagel but it was really good.\n\nI wish there was a little more room inside to enjoy sitting down but if you get there early I am sure you will get a great seat. Can't wait to try their infamous eggs Benedict doughnut that I always miss and some of their other pastries. \n\nBasically, go to SweetDee's if you like upscale, fun and innovative sweets because you will not be disappointed.
