Can't say I ever imagined myself giving a good review to a DMV...but there is a first time for everything right? I didn't have the twenty minute luck of Georgie but in and out in forty on a Friday isn't bad either!  Don't think I've ever been in and out of a DMV in under an hour.\n\nI only needed to change my FL license to a AZ license.  Still need to return after I am able to get an emissions test done on my car so that I can get the tags updated, but I don't dread going to this location again! \n\nThe only line that was semi-inconvenient was the line to get a number. I always find it funny to wait in line to get a ticket to...wait in line. \n\nOverall: A-\nIt's still the DMV, so be sure to have your paperwork \/ requirements ready to go, but it's not the horror show that the DMV in FL is!
