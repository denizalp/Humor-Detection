Woah, I don't know what Tim T. is going on about a waitress not bringing him his food and all of that in his review. If he complained about lack of parking (tiny lot out back) or the fact that unless you're out on a perfect day, you'll be freezing or burning on the metal seating outdoors, I would agree, but there was nothing wrong with the service.\n\nSmoke's has no indoor seating. It's basically a walkup counter with an area for a line to form inside. You order and the cashier will call your name when it's ready. \n\nThere are 3 sizes - a big one that is 2 lbs. A \"meal size\" which is 1 lb & a \"snack size\" but the cashier said he had never weighed a snack out. Probably about 1\/2 the size I'd guess.\n\nBrian and I split a traditional meal sized for $7.99. That felt really pricy for Canada's most famous drunk food. The gravy was very thin but good - I could taste the rosemary. Cheese curds were not what I expected - it was a sort of a cheesestick consistency. I expected more cheese for both the price & mountain of fries.\n\nThese are much better than the god awful salt lick poutine at Brooklyn Bowl, but I'd definitely try non traditional next time.
