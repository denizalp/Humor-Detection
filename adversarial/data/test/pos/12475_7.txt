I kept procrastinating on getting the wedding gown cleaned. Dove was a little more than other places through my research. However, it was on the way home and I really cannot be bugged driving out of my way midtown, in traffic just to save a little bit. Plus if & when I decide to sell the gown, it would be more appealing to buyers if it was done with a reputable company.\n\nIt was $200 + tax (no box, cleaned) or $250 + tax (cleaned w\/ box). Alterations (i had 3 small rips) was included. They had it ready for me in two weeks (originally said a month). It's preserved in a nice gold box & another white cardboard box. \n\nThe only thing is... I can't inspect it (since it's boxed) but they did say if there are problems I can go back anytime. Save ur receipt!\n\nService was great. They were very polite :) Lots of parking. No appointments needed
