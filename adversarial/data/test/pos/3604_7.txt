I have been wanted to try BLT Burger in NY, but I ran out of time....so I went to check it out today.\n\nMy babe and I ordered the American Wagyu hamburger with chedder cheese and an egg, sides of waffle and sweet potato fries and the Twinkie Boy shake.\n\nThe burger was very avg.....for $20.00, I was expecting a much tender and fattier taste of beef.  It was good.....but not as good as the $40.00 Kobe Hamburger at the Old Homestead in NY.....that burger was worth the $$$$$.\n\nThe fries were ok....but the Twinkie Boy Shake was fucking-outstanding!!\n\nIt tasted just like a twinkie......soooo good...\n\nFor desert, we had the Krispy Kreme bread pudding...again.....fucking-outstanding!\n\nI came in my pants eating the pudding and drinking my shake......the hot Asian waitress taking care of my table added to the meal highlight!\n\nShe flirted w\/me during the whole meal.......oh yeagh!
