I'm so glad I came here due to a friend's recommendation. I had my consultation today and then the laser hair removal. I was so scared and nervous, but the staff was incredibly patient and nice. Anahit explained to me throughly what to expect and she really put my nerves at ease. Considering I was doing Brazilian, you can only imagine how uncomfortable the situation can be. She took her time and when I needed a break, she stopped. I am going to tell you, my pain tolerance is low. I am a huge cry baby. Does it hurt? It does, but it's tolerable. If you have ever waxed ladies, you can go through this easily. I was surprised how quick it was. I was expecting to be there for at least 30 min! But the laser was so quick! I will say, some parts are way more sensitive than other parts, but it sure beats waxing! Make sure you shave really well the day before (close shave, try to not have stubs) and don't miss any spots! The place is really nice and clean. Don't be embarrassed to tell Anahit all your medical history and\/or concerns. The more honest you are, the better you are off. She is incredibly knowledgable and knows what she is talking about. She will tell you honestly what to expect. Love it! Thank you so much to the whole staff for making me feel comfortable during the procedure.
