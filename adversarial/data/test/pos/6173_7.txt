This is a cool place or at least the concept is.  Yes, some may think the prices are high, but you pay for the convenience of not having to buy a cold press machine, all the organic ingredients, and spend the time making your own juice.  Now that we are past the price issue, the staff have always been nothing short of AMAZING.\n\nThey do NOT give a military discount except on special holidays I am told but that is ok.  The one issue I do have with this place, is the juice is not prepared here, it is prepared at their store across town and trucked over.  What does that mean?\n\nThere is only a limited supply of juices available at any given time.  Even though the menu shows all juices they provide, a Half Moon shows which one's they do not have.  So out of the 14 or so items I counted on the menu, 6 were not available???\n\nNeedless to say I left this place with a smoothie but no juice to take home.  WHY???\n\nThere are certain ingredients I do not like in my juice and it just so happened that the 6 juices that do not include that ingredient were the one's they did not have.  Since we were there primarily for my wife who has to have several juices a day because of a current medical condition she is fighting, I told her not to worry about me and pick the juices she likes.\n\nI am sure she will be back there several times as this is a place to grab a premade juice on the go, its quick, easy and make a great meal replacement boost your energy and give you what you need to keep going without the food coma effect.\n\nThis is a place you should give a try if you need a quick juice, like I said the staff is AMAZING, this place is VERY easy to get in and out of and they have a few good healthy snacks as well.  Stop in, understand you are paying for the convenience having a cold pressed juice made and ready to go AND if you bring the bottle back, they will give you a discount on your next purchase....
