My honey took me to as many of the local breweries I could handle while visiting Las Vegas. In the end there are no 5 star breweries in Vegas, but CraftHaus is as close as you'll get to greatness here.\n\nNot sure what it was about this place, yet when I walked in, I immediately felt welcomed. Perhaps it was the brightly colored, brightly lit atmosphere. This is no dank 'n dark bar scene. It looks more funky coffee house than tap room.\n\nCool touches from the Bill Murray pillow on the couch, the huge windows behind the bar that give you a view of what's going on in the brewery area, to using what looks like a utensil drain rack to hold the samplers, shows that they thought an awful lot about the details of the brew paradise. \n\nThe impromptu mini brewery tour, led by brewmaster Steve was one of a kind. In fact, we were about to leave after I finished the sampler when we heard folks gathering for a beer tour. Even though the brewery consists of one large room, with only a few tanks, it's as informative as you'll find. In fact, with all his Aussie wit, Steve was the perfect host of a beer tour. \n\nBeing a small brewery, the selection is limited for now. They had only three available on our visit. They do have guest beers on tap to round out a full sampler. The few house beers they had on tap were all high quality. Even though I'm not a saison fan, the saison was actually quite memorable. \n\nAfter trying it in the sampler, I had to order a tall pint of the their IPA. As a young Isaiah Thomas wannabe, I often heard this saying that could equally be applied to this beer, \"nice hops!\". Very nice indeed. The combination of Chinook, Centennial, and Cascade hops isn't anything new, yet Steve and company managed to nail it here.\n\nHopefully when we return in another year or so, CraftHaus will be have managed to expand their offerings while still maintaining their high level of character.
