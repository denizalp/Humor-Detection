Shout out to seeing Emily R, her dude, and mom in the same restaurant!  It lets me know I have good taste in food hahaha.  \n\nSo after my impromptu trip to New Jersey (sneaked over to NY for a cronut) this was my first stop after getting off the plane.  I joined my past friend's family for Bastille Day lunch here.  I brought a Cronut back so I could split it with whoever wanted to try them.  But anyway, Comme Ca didn't have any special item on the menu for French National Day, I thought they were supposed to have some grilled leg of lamb with lavender thyme juice.  It sounded so good when I was told about it over the phone when I was invited but nope, they didn't have jack shit for French National Day.\n\nI didn't want to rack up the bill so I bought my Guiness and Lyric red wine(Lyric is gooood) at the bar and brought it back.  As for my meal I had beef tartare as my appetizer, it was good but I've had better (Ramsay Steak).  The tartare was topped with poached egg, I smashed through that yolk and mixed the whole thing together.  Bland in taste but good.\n\nThere's no salt\/pepper on the table but you can ask for it.\n\nMy entree was the Oxtail benedict.  The Oxtail tasted like that from Bachi Burgers.  The benedict dish was served unique.  The bread was the french cheese puff pastry then fried spinach, then layered with the oxtail, then topped with poached eggs (YUM), and finally topped with hollandaise sauce, it's supposed to be truffle hollandaise but I couldn't taste the truffle.\n\nThe Oxtail benedict was good, but I wish I had the talked about Bastille Day menu.  For the price of the food items at least they were appropriate.  Steak tartare $16, Oxtail Benedict $22, drinks overpriced as usual but we're at the Cosmo.\n\nThe restaurant is nice and our party sat against the wall, I was at the end so I had window seats.  Awesome!  Our server was kind of a newb, at one point when he was putting food down his towel caught some of the cream cheese butter on a party members waffle and when he flicked his towel\/napkin it flew onto some peoples clothes.  He looked embarrassed but didn't offer to help,  maybe because other people were trying to already help him but damn, get him some extra napkins, I don't think he asked for sweet cream cheese to go with his salmon croissant.\n\nI didn't have a Groupon or anything but I would still come back, I need to try that bone marrow!\n\nThe butter served with the bread is whipped butter. :)
