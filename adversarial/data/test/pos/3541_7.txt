this may have been the 1st all-you-can-eat sushi place where i got my money's worth.  (or i guess i should say \"my cousin's money's worth\" since she paid.)  not only because i ate a lot, but the prices for individual sushi was expensive!    \n\nfor $25, you can sit for 2 hours and order as much sushi as you can eat.  or for $30, you can get sushi with tempura, teriyaki, etc. too.  watch out for the \"rules\", like no sharing, must eat all the rice, must finish all food before you can order more food, etc.  the watiers lurk around probably watching for rule breakers, but i was able to sneak off about 6 pieces of sushi to my cousins.\n\ni usually shy away from all-you-can-eat sushi places, especially if it's a half teppan\/half sushi place, but i also trust my cousin's japanese wife's taste.  the fish really was pretty fresh here.  \n\nthere's a large menu of sushi, teriyaki, noodles, etc., so definitely something for everyone.  good place for groups. \n\nthe only negative is the service for the all-you-can-eat is SLOW!  we determined they do this on purpose to give you time to fill up, so you can't order as much sushi.  sneaky!
