Jiffy Smog (Aliante Parkway, North Las Vegas, NV)\n\nI can't believe that it's been over 10 years since the last time I had to get any of my cars smog checked.  The last time I had to get my car smog checked was in California.  There, the prices are a lot higher, the wait is longer, and it's very tough to pass.  Here, the prices aren't too bad , wait is 10 times faster, and I had zero issues passing.  I timed it.  In less than 4 minutes, I was in and out.  Hmm...In-N-Out.  Back to the review.  I am a fan of Jiffy Smog.  Cost for a smog check is $28.  Price is a little higher than most.  The convenience more than makes up for it.  \n\nTIP #1:  Yes, they ask for tips.
