I tried Rosati's a year ago and wasn't impressed at all. The toppings were scarce and the sauce was very thin. So I didn't like it..... \nWell, a few days ago I decided to give it a second chance and went there for a lunch with a friend of mine. This time I was not disappointed. Pizza was on good. Toppings and the sauce were generously spread. We also ordered Rosati's jumbo wings, Mozzarella sticks, Garlic bread and Ceasar salad. Everything tasted pretty good, not as a year ago. The service was slower than I had expected. But the staff was friendly. There was a TV and free WiFi. \nMaybe I`ll come back here in the future, but there are definitely better places in Vegas for pizza
