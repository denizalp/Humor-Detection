These are donuts for people who think they don't like donuts. \n\nWhy? Because once you've tried one you'll say, \"Wow--this must be what donuts are supposed to taste like.\" Or maybe even a \"Oh, so this is why everyone goes nuts over these things.\" \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'll alway be a bagel gal, but these donuts are the top of the line. I had one--just one!--and it shook my world. And get this... It was only a glazed one. I know. That little 'ole glazed donut was airy, light, not too sweet, perfection in my mouth. It's mind-boggling that I didn't even eat it hot and it was still that good. \n\nAnyways, I'm going back and I'm not even waiting for a cheat day. It's worth the extra day of exercise, trust me--and these 5-stars.
