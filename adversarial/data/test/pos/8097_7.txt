Oh my goodness, the food here in incredible! Not to mention their fabulous, dog friendly patio!! My boyfriend and I wanted to soak up our beautiful AZ weather with the pooch and hadn't been here so we gave it a shot! I ordered the brown bag chicken salad sandwich and it was phenomenal! Different than your average chicken salad sandwich, in a good way! Avocado, goat cheese and hazelnuts? Yes, please! I got a side salad with it that was tossed in an amazing mustard-y vinaigrette! We also shared a side of their house made chips which are a must! My boyfriend got the pastrami reuben and holy heaven, it was MASSIVE! But amazing. From 11 AM - 5 PM everyday, they have $5 pitchers of beer (not just any beer, GOOD beer!), cocktails & wine! If you have guests in town, this would be the perfect place to take them!
