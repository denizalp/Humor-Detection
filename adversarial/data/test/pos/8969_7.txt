I tried the sukiyaki udon. There was absolutely NOTHING wrong with this dish.  The noodles were Chewie and not soggy. The soup was very flavorful.  The portion was more than expected. I definitely paid less than what I got which is great! Will be coming back and trying a new dish and hopefully it's justg as good!
