Cilantro Rack in conveniently located downstairs from my office off of Silverado Ranch and Maryland Parkway in the Smith's shopping center. It opened in late March, and I decided to check it out during a lunch break. \n\nIt's a Mom and Pop type of deal that specializes in discounted clothing and accessories. This store kind of reminds me of a Factory 2 U. It's not as \"dirty\" as Fallas Parades, but definitely not a Burlington's or TJ Maxx. They offer clothing for women of all sizes and men as well. I did see a couple of decent brands in the store, and nothing was priced over $19.99.\n\nI am personally not a fan of the clothing they sell, but they clerk did say they did get new stuff in all the time. An update may be coming soon.
