CASH ONLY!\n\nWhen in PIT for business I was told that I had to go to Deluca's for breakfast.  Now, I am telling you the same.  This place is in the Strip and has been there for a very long time.  A nice variety of items on the menu.  This is old school dinner at it's very best.\n\nCASH ONLY!\nCASH ONLY!\nCASH ONLY!
