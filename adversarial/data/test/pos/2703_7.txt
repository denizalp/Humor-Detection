I know, you're thinking that a 5 star review for a fast food joint doesn't seem quite right. But as far as fast food chain restaurants go, this place offers a little something extra that even some of the best restaurants in town could learn from. \n\nI took an out of town visitor to Dairy Queen tonight with the hopes of finding an \"Oh Henry\" flavoured Blizzard. Unfortunately, this isn't one of their stock flavours, but never fear, the extremely kind older gentleman behind the counter is extremely accommodating and suggested that if we were to go out and purchase an Oh Henry chocolate bar, he would custom make the desired Oh Henry Blizzard for us!\n\nWhen we returned with our coveted chocolate bar, the same gentleman flashed us a huge grin and made the best damn Oh Henry Blizzard this town has ever seen. The Blizzards were packed with flavour and were made without crazy wait period. And true to the DQ way, they even flipped it upside down when they served it to us! Now that's what I call going a little above and beyond to make the customer happy. \n\nThis helpful gentleman appears to run the place, and he was extremely kind, had a great sense of humour and as has a beautiful smile. I was absolutely impressed with my visit to this particular Dairy Queen and even though it is not the closest location to my house, the smile we got makes it worth the extra drive!\n\n--\nL
