My girlfriends and I walked in for the first time and we had an excellent experience! I wasn't sure what the fuss and the negativity was all about other than some bad publicity from a reality show. But as a customer, all I care about is great food and service. We ordered spaghetti, caprese salad and the fig pear proscuitto pizza- all were absolutely delicious! Plus, the owner who was also our server was very attentive and respectful toward us. Even when we were clearly done eating, with my leftover pizza in a box, he refrained from bringing us the check right away seeing that my friends and I were in a deep conversation. I love this kind of  personal service that enhances your total dining experience! Next time I will be bringing my husband in for a date night and trying one of their amazing desserts as well as other menu items!
