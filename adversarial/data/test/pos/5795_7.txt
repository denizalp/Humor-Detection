Sports and Chinese food, what more can I say! If you're tired of the same old wings and burgers, do yourself a favor and come in to meet Gary, Jackie and the rest of the staff for an enjoyable afternoon\/evening.\n\nGary, the owner, prides himself on the quality of the food that his chef's are preparing as well as the draft beer selection to include Kirin, Modelo Especial, San Tan, Dos XX, as well as a few others. \n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated, comfortable and welcoming with plenty of room for larger groups and families so do yourself a favor, stop in, have a beer or glass of wine with some delicious food and you'll probably become a regular. Even if you're just looking for quick take-out, I'm sure you'll enjoy!
