The woman at the register was semi helpful, I was expecting a juice\/vegetable connoisseur to help with me and my partner's EDC hangover. Instead she suggested the green shot and we just picked a juice ourselves for almost $20. I would probably come back again like a fool telling myself it's healthy and it will cure any type of hangover but I should remember to not expect much. \nI'm sure all the juice have their health benefits but I was just expecting to feel instantly better. Oh well. \nFYI the beet juice makes you poop that color, it's normal. I wish I didn't waste my time freaking out about that... Lol
