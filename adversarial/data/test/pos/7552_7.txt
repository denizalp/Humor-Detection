My Macbook Pro display died a couple of days ago. Genius Bar wanted $755 plus tax to fix.\nI needed my laptop for a business trip two days later. Due to the excellent reviews on Yelp I emailed Computer Repair Las Vegas. Adam quickly responded. He quoted me around $300 for a screen replacement, if it was the screen. He honestly told me if it was a fuse on the board it would not be worth the price to repair. Adam came to my house the next morning to pick up my Laptop. Bare in mind that his shop is about 40 minutes from where I live.\nHe returned by Laptop early evening completely fixed! It was not the display, but a cluster of dust around the video cable. The complete charge including the complementary pick up and drop of was $99!!!! Absolutely unbelievably Brilliant! Rarely, if ever, have I received such excellent service.  \nI was so impressed that I am writing my first review ever, on the laptop he fixed, at the airport waiting on my flight.\nIf you need any computer help and live anywhere in Vegas or Henderson call Adam and Computer Repair of Las Vegas.\nThanks Again!!!
