I {heart} Goodwill...\n\nBrought in a bag of stuff from my house to donate...got a coupon and found some stuff to buy! \n\nThis isn't as clean as some of the other Goodwill stores, but they were friendly and I FOUND stuff (important!)...yippee!\n\nThey have really a really NASTY restroom here...didn't even want to go in just to wash my hands. YIKES!\n\nThis GW is located across the street from Fiesta Mall & parking is easy.
