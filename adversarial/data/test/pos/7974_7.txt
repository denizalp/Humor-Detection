This place is horrible. Took an android and an iPhone to get the screen replaced and both have problems with the touch screen. The guy that actually makes the repairs is looking to Nickel and dime you for everything including 20 dollars for screws he forgot to put back. Horrible customer service. Save yourself the hassle and stress. Go to a pro because your phone won't work right and he doesn't guarantee any service at all. His excuse for everything \"Apple is a pain in the neck, they are too smart.\"
