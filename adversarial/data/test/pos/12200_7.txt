Hate to date myself, but as a kid I was in Las Vegas in the days of the wise guys.  When the Wynn was the Desert Inn, and the Rat Pack was playing the Sands.  No high-rises.  People dressed for dinner and looked sharp for the casinos; the lounge acts were cool, no lines, no all-you-can eat buffets, no huge, fat people or oxygen breathers on their chair scooters.  No bling!  Just elegance.\n\nThe Wynn epitomizes today's Vegas.  What you see on The Strip is what you used to see downtown.  ANYBODY can get in, and they do.  The public areas are tacky and loud, ditto for the rooms, though they are well-appointed and spacious.  This is franchise luxury. (The Sinatra Restaurant at the adjoining Encore has Chicken Saltimbocca -- chicken???  Old Blue Eyes is spinning in his grave.)\n\nAs a Vegas hotel these days, the Wynn is one of the best.  If you can get a good deal, then definitely go.  Frankly, I prefer the Red Rock.  Though way off The Strip, it's kinda like the old Vegas -- a place in the desert where you can gamble.
