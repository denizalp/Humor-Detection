Hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast food, pie, how could you go wrong? I admit their burgers aren't the best I've had but  they are good and I'd get them again. I do have to admit that I lived in southern California for a long time, where burger spots like this were ALL over the place, and many of them were very good so it's probably an unfair comparison. \n\nWhat I especially love are their breakfasts. You can get breakfast for so cheap it's ridiculous, between $5-$9 to stuff yourself silly and everything tastes very good. The employees are so friendly. Service is quick, it's seat yourself and order at the counter. I'm really glad this place exists.
