Though most flock to Crust for the pizza and pasta, sometimes a salad is in order. Gotta eat healthy(ish) every few meals, right?\n\nGood news - Crust serves salads as well. Meal-sized portions that could satisfy even zealous appetites like mine. This summer, Crust is serving a kale and apple salad that comes highly recommended. Yes, you heard it here first, I'm actually suggesting that you order a dish with kale as the main attraction.\n\nServed with shredded chicken and a dollop of goat cheese on top, this green concoction had just the right leafy:meat ratio. And the bowl was very generous, kept this girl satisfied until dinnertime. \n\nMy dining companion enjoyed the Greek salad, which comes in its own crusted bread bowl. You can literally eat your way in and out of this salad. \n\nVery nice, attentive service and a pretty quick lunch, which is important on a weekday.
