Ate here for like around the tenth time yesterday at midnight and it is as good as it ever was.  This is still the soft opening menu, but they are getting it right and making it righter.  \n\nHad the Mac and Cheese, friends had the burger, the chorizo omlette, the spicy Benedict, all were good.  The stand out is the apple pie, home made, huge and wonderful.\n\nService was good, real sweetheart and it made for a great night with a big group of friends.\n\nEggs to go? Why would you do such a thing?
