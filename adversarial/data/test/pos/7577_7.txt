3-1\/2 Stars...  I was driving by the old neighborhood and had to swing by.  The chicken teriyaki bowl still taste the same from when I was a kid.  The chicken is grilled and perfectly seasoned withe the teriyaki sauce served over white rice.  I did not stay got the bowl togo, but they could update the place a little.
