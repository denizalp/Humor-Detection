Ehh... I have mixed feelings on my first visit to this restaurant.\nPositives:  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very attentive and friendly. They had live entertainment which was also very nice. The fried puppies appetizer came hot and fresh and I thought  they were a great concept. They made a good Moscow Mule and had some interesting beers on tap, including a beer only made in the Louisiana.\n\nNegatives: I got the chicken and sausage jambalaya. I was enjoying it very much, until I bit into a piece of chicken. The chicken had that awful flavor that it gets when it sits in the refrigerator too long. The chicken definitely was not freshly made. This was very off putting. Also the garlic bread barely had a char on it. It tasted like buttered bread.
