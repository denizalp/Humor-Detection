When you compare Fair Trade to Conspire and Lux ... ummm ... well ... there is no comparison ... Fair Trade's decor is BLAND and last time I went there the Barista was less than personable.\n\nAlso they lack the electrical outlets at every table which at this late state in the game is a fail for any coffeehouse.
