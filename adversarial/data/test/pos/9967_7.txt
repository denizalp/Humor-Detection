You turned my skin into hamburger that's like the most disrespectful thing that you could do as a tattoo artist, not only disrespecting yourself or others but putting a bad name on your work. And damaging people's skin. \nThe point is quality.\nPlease take responsibility as an artist & learn from this mistake. what you did to my skin is fucked up & not right.. \nso please stop doing shitty work & and practice on a fucking chicken from the grocery store, before you fucking practice on a human being. \n\nPicture 1 of 5.
