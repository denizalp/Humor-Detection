Forget The Strip! Forget Downtown! This is where the real Vegas lives! As close to covering the fabulous Mint 400 as you can get, a stay at the Boulder Station Hotel & Casino is what Vegas is all about.\n\nThe wife and I brought my MIL here for her Christmas present. When I first learned of this plan, my first thought was that Boulder Station is in the middle of nowhere!! We were to basically, babysit my MIL, along with one of her friends who, thankfully, agreed to tag along.\n\nI've never been a fan of Vegas. The Strip: it's a twisted Fantasyland with its delicate balancing act of catering to both families and opulent adult excesses. Likewise, Downtown Las Vegas has fallen into the marching order with its Fremont Street Experience, the holographic whales drifting above craning heads; a virtual LSD trip but without the dangerous free-fall. \n\nSometimes you just don't want to fight the crowds, and when the bells, whistles, and flashing lights get too much, always remember that there are places like Boulder Station.\n\nLocated on Boulder Highway yards from the off ramps of Interstate-515, Boulder Station has everything you need on your search for the American Dream: casino, buffet, movie theater, a decent bed. It's not what you'd call \"swanky\", but it'll do. The casino is theme-free, lacking any sort of glitzy pretense or staffers who must stay \"in character\"; the buffet, not the best you'll have nor the worst, is a perfect place to land, refuel, and takeoff on your middle-stakes red-eye; the Edwards Theater within the complex features screening rooms small enough for a house in the Hollywood Hills, but who really notices once the movie's started?\n\nOur room was a-okay. It's no suite at the Wynn but the room was perfect enough for our needs: a clean place to sleep and to get tidied-up. Really, what else do you need?? The only complaint by the wife was that the hairdryer did not work, but other than that, I would totally stay here again.\n\nOh, did I mention I won about eighty dollars on a penny machine? Yeah, the credits came in handy for killing time. \n\nI learned that the Station Casinos tend to attract Las Vegas locals, and that is what made this place so awesome to me. The people-watching here is different than the more touristy spots in this evil, evil city. The bar downstairs clears its dance floor and becomes an open air club, the unseen DJ fueling a crazed moshpit filled with all manner of shapes, sizes, and ages: the crazy old man with the cobra-quick moves flying solo, yet at the same time friends with everyone; the twenty-something blonde in the black dress gyrating before a pimp-a-licious paraplegic, then turning around to reveal someone old enough to be his mother. YOW!! Even so, this place seemed more \"real\" to me than the touristy places in this crazy City.\n \nWhat I liked about Boulder Station is that it doesn't pretend to be something that it's not, and despite all that glitters in Vegas, this very thing is what made this place all the more rooted in reality. The true Vegas experience, I discovered, is not the New York skyline, faux pirates looting a ship, or roman soldiers taking your photo, but the unpolished flair that only the local flavor can impart to a place like this.\n\nI may not have found the American Dream at Boulder Station, but  the price was right, the accommodations were adequate, I had a great time, and for the first time, with all the lucidity I can muster, I can honestly say, \"God, I love this town.\"
