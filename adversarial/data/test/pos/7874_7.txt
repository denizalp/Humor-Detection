Wrinkle fries - My favorite type of fry! More crunchy than soft.\n\nVanilla custard ice cream with strawberry syrup - Lots of space in the center but was filling anyway. The strawberry syrup added an extra layer of sweet. Ask for more next time. \n\nPrice - Nearly $10 for a small burger. \n\nStaff - Friendly, approachable, and more than accommodating in bringing out food or providing extra condiments (ex. Can I get extra, extra Shake Shack sauce on the side?)\n\nAlcohol selection - Have their own wines! Will try that next time.
