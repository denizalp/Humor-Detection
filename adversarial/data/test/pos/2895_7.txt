While I'm not quite sure what the tomatoes find so funny, hitting up this place has been on my agenda for a year or 2 now. Feels good to finally ketchup.\n\nLocated at the corner of Queen and Kennedy, Giggling Tomatoes puts itself in dangerous territory. Not only does it have to compete with the Asian cuisine and Crabby Joes across the street, it also has to lock horns with the popular evening spots like Sonny's, Burrito Boyz, and Taco Bell, though its closing time is oddly early.\n\nAt first I thought I'd wandered into Jurassic Park. The ceiling and walls are decorated with forest designs, faux leaves hanging, and the colour of the booth padding matches, which were also very comfy. There is also a plasma TV hanging by the exit, in case you feel that burning desire to watch CP24 while waiting for your food.\n\nThe menu was surprisingly extensive. They have an all-day breakfast setup (complete with peameal bacon and a good selection of omelettes), as well as diner goodies like grilled cheese, soup, salad, gyros, and BLT's. They also offer a vast list of lunch\/dinner options: Souvlaki, chicken shawarma, wraps, steak, seafood, burgers, and pastas with shrimp\/chicken. They also offer beer and wine if you choose to partake. The prices are all extremely reasonable as well. \n\nBeing a half-hour before closing, I'm not sure if they normally have more staff on hand, but they had one very sweet server and one cook while I was there. Being so late, I ended up skipping the big breakfast I was craving, and opted for their Home Style Burger with Onion Rings instead. Pretty risky, considering I could very easily get a trouser-tickling burgasm at Sonny's instead, but seeing as how the price of burger was the same in both locations, I thought I'd steel-cage-match this bitch, and see which burger came out on top. The onion rings were onion rings. I don't think I've ever had an onion ring that was inedible, or didn't taste like all of the others, so it's burger time!\n\nHoly Kennedy and Queen cattlecaust! Burgasm achieved here as well! In terms of cooking time, I had to wait longer for GT's slice of sly steer, but the portion was much thicker than Sonny's. Flavourful, fresh-bunned, and served with a smile. I'm a fan, and have a whopper of a menu to burn through on subsequent visits. \n\nIf the tomatoes' giggles are that of the chest-out 'bring it' persuasion, they have the right.
