Island Pacific Seafood Market is where I do most of my Asian grocery shopping mostly because of convenience. It's a much smaller version of Seafood City Supermarket, carrying various Asian grocery items a good number of the Filipino variety. Obviously go to Chinatown for more speciality items.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you're welcomed with all these yummy baked goods and desserts. It seems like I always leave with something even when I try to avoid getting anything. It's perfectly located near the cash registers and entrance so it's the first and last thing you'll see in and out of the store.\n\nThey have a good selection of seafood and meats. Not the largest selection of fruits and vegetables. Most of the items are reasonably priced. Check their ads items get cheap. They have ube ice cream and ingredients to make halo halo if that's important to you. The aisles are tight and they only have 4 cash registers. I've heard it gets bad when it's busy but luckily I've never experienced it.\n\nIf you're not looking into grocery shopping they also have PhilHouse. They serve all kinds of cooked food. The foods actually not that bad. You can either take it to go or dine-in.\n\nI'll be back.
