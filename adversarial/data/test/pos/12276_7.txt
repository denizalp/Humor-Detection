love the venue.. it's so nice! and because it's mostly outdoor, it is not stuffy. \n\nsign up for the guest list - ladies are free. guys paid a reduced price, if you have those \"reduced admission\" cards. My guy friends ended up saving $10.\n\ni didnt like the music at first - they kept playing house music. But later on the music started getting better. Go Go Dancers are hot! i couldnt keep my eyes off of them. lol \n\nThe dancefloor is small though, it's indoor and it gets crowded fast. I suggest u dance outside with the pretty lights and breathable air!
