If you want the world's shittiest customer service, and you enjoy paying for a service you NEVER receive,  SIGN UP NOW! . I have been on hold for 50 minutes trying to CONFIRM my unsubscription . I called a week ago and the lady hung up on me. I received a phone call earlier about a new newspaper and if I wanted to add that to my bill . I told her I unsubscribed& she just went silent . Not hanging up, not saying a word, just silence for a minute. Not to mention I've listened to the same song on hold for 50 minutes , this is insanity. I never received my damn newspaper anyway. This place is a joke.
