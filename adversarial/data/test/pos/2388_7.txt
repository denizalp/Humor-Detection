Never in my wildest of Yelping dreams did I imagine that I'd be giving Subway a 3 star review. For the most part, I'm just not a fan of the chain as a whole. But this particular location is different...and having lived just around the corner from here for about 3 years now, I've been here enough to say this one sets itself apart from any other one I've been too.\n\nIt is located in the Albertsons shopping center off of Farm & Durango just a few doors down from Starbucks. While fairly small like most Subway locations, this is easily one of the cleanest and most well-kept fast food restaurants. Every time we've been here, the place is spotless both in the dining area and behind the counter. All the separate areas for things like chips and sodas are well organized. Just seconds after someone leaves, they are coming through to wipe up and straighten everything up. It's really a very well run spot and honestly, that's just nice to see.\n\nNow, as far as the food goes...it's still a Subway. Most of the time the sandwiches are a major hit and miss and don't deserve but 2 stars on their own. Sometimes the bread is obviously old, sometimes the ingredients have clearly been sitting out for a while and sometimes something just doesn't taste right. But every now and then you can a pretty decent sandwich here, and they're fairly cheap too. Most 6\" subs can be had for under $5 and I usually get the Spicy Italian with double meat ($1.50 extra) that comes out to $5.50. Not that I'm anywhere near worried about watching what I eat, even though I should be, but I feel better about spending six bucks on this opposed to a greasy burger or burrito. Sure, I love those things a lot more, but a sandwich really hits the spot sometime. Plus I'm a huge fan of putting cucumbers on my sandwich and that is strangely one of my biggest reasons for coming here over other sandwiches chains in the area. I also like the different sauces they offer, including the Creamy Sriracha sauce that I think is really tasty. \n\nBut what really makes us frequent this Subway, is the staff. They move really quick and we've never had to wait more than a couple minutes. Pretty much every single employee we've dealt with has been great, and one of the managers in particular is just straight up a nice dude. They're always extremely friendly and not once have we been rushed or gotten attitude like you expect from fast food chains. Even during a summer visit where their AC was out, these guys were smiling and going about their job without a hitch. In this Vegas heat, that's a feat all on its own. \n\nThere's no argument that much, much better sandwiches can be found in Las Vegas, even if you're just looking at chains. But Subway has cheap ones that can be decent, and our family of 3 can easily eat and be full for well under $20. And with service that's all but unheard of in fast food, we will definitely continue to be repeat customers.
