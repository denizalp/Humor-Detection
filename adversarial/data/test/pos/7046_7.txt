I WOULD GIVE NEGATIVE FIVE STARS IF YELP WOULD LET ME BUT I HAVE TO GIVE AT  LEAST ONE :( This place is just around the corner from my house. This afternoon I decided to venture over so that my 14 mo. could take a peek at the horses. Their sign at the corner says ,\"Visitors Welcome, call for an appointment.  Children must be accompanied by an adult\". I waited for a moment to see if someone would come through the gate so that I could ask to see if it would be OK if we took a quick walk though just to look. Soon enough a gentleman came out and said I could talk to the \"boss\" about walking around. As soon as that was said to me, an older man who I now glean to be the \"boss\" came towards me in a golf cart. Long story short,  he threw me out without even a chance to explain why I was there or let me know when\/how to \"make an appointment\". He was so unnecessarily curt and mean. I honestly cannot remember the last time I was treated so rudely. I was astonished. When I got home I called their business phone number and explained what had happened. I told the woman that I wanted to see just a couple of horses with my baby and that I have 3 kids that I would have considered putting in riding lessons there but now would NEVER, given how I had been treated. She. Hung. Up. On. Me.!!!! \nThese people are horrid! So sad to think that they would treat a neighbor in such a way. Steer clear of this place!!!!
