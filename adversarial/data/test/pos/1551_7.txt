So nice to have a new type of environment to hang out in Scottsdale.\n\nDecor - Its so clean and sophisticated sharp decor right when you walk in tn the door , you immediately want a drink when you see the beautiful bar in the center of the floor. OK OK I'm a little obsessed I know:) with good reason!!\n\nFood- I have tried several things on the menu and was impressed with every hing ! LAMB BURGER!!! a must!!!\n\nService was friendly and professional. This place is here to stay !
