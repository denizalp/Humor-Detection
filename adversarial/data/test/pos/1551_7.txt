This place is fucking worthless.\n\nA half-ass Wal Mart in every sense of the word. None of the department items are ever fully stocked. They never have what I need. \n\nAlso - did I mention ghetto? For a WalMart, that is saying a lot.\n\nOne of the pharmacy techs asked my husband if he had AIDS, because the computer said ADS next to his name (which she later found out meant update his address). Like, wtf. \n\nThe photo center is just a bunch of do it yourself printers. And the employees have no knowledge. \n\nDon't waste your time, try another store or hit up Target.
