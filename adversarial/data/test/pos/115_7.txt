Having recently located to Charlotte from Los Angeles, I'm going through restaurant withdrawal. Not that there aren't good joints here, of course, but compared with LA's crazily inventive and always-dynamic scene, Charlotte's been a bit of an adjustment. That's why I'm glad that Fahrenheit's on the scene. It's out there taking some chances - bringing some Asian elements here, dashing in some Southern style cooking there, but pulling it off with some well-executed flair that hitherto hadn't quite made it to the Queen City. Service is pretty solid for a restaurant of its newness and size and, frankly,  it's leaps and bounds over most other places I've been during my five months here in town. Food standouts here include the inventive cocktail list (very few joints here in town are similarly daring); the ramen (I mean, it's probably the only place to get that outside of Musashi, and the view at Fahrenheit is better than the Ballantyne strip mall that place occupies); the sashimi appetizer; the pork tenderloin; the all-day braised bacon and grits; and the short ribs. I give it a solid four stars and an additional fifth for the potential that I see.\n\nOh, and one other thing - step up your game, Charlotte. This is a nice new place with a great view. Don't show up in your cargo jorts and flip-flops. Have some pride.
