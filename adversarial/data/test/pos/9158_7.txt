We dined here at Lakeside on Saturday night with two other couple. It's located inside Wynn right across the SW steakhouse. This Restuarant is beautiful & has a waterfall outside. They played a laser show every 20 min or so. It was so nice. The lighting & the colors of the restuarant is just perfect. The bathrooms are so nice with orange sink. Very unique & trendy ambiance.\n\nThey have the Rib Eye Glatt Kosher steak!!!! I personally asked to see it, it was sealed & had the OU sign. I was so happy that they had this service. \n\nWe ordered the Glatt kosher Rib-eye steak, the black bass & 2 of our friends ordered the regular steak with chili & crab on it. All dishes were very delicious. Mine was a bit more well-done than what I wanted it to be but I was so happy I was having kosher steak in a Restuarant like that with the beautiful ambiance, I didn't care at all. Usually when we go to restaurants, my husband & I are forced to get sea food because they don't have a kosher option. We just have to sit & watch our friends eating their yummy steak while we eat our boring salmon!! So the fact that we could have our kosher steak with everyone else was just priceless.\n\nI also heard all restaurants at Wynn have vegetarian & vegan menu.\n\nFor desert, we ordered the coffee creme brûlée (very unique), orange chocolate & macadamia donut with tea & coffee. The desert was so delicious. Perfect amount of sweetness. Not too sweet.\n\nWe asked to be seated outside for the desert part so we can watch the waterfall show better. Jason, our waiter was so nice, respectful & he made that happen. The service was outstanding, I highly recommend this place & will go back to it next time I go to Vegas.
