A lengthy drive from my home in Chandler but worth it!  In large shopping center, easy parking.  Staff is friendly and efficient with good service.  Sports bar atmosphere with several large flat screens, a well stocked bar and adjacent dining room. Tables and seating was clean and comfortable.  We ordered a large shrimp and octopus cocktail, a 5 star dish, loaded with the seafood, crunchy cucumber, tomato juice, etc.,very tasty and filling, and only $13, and Bacanora, described as shrimp in mildly spiced cheese sauce, served with rice, potato slices and salad, a 3 star dish, ($14) with 6 medium shrimp despite the fact that the menu photo had twice as many shrimp, and no spiciness at all. We drank the House Margarita, $6 as it was happy hour (3-6pm).  Also had the house wine at $3.50 a glass.  We closed with Sopapillas with powdered sugar and honey, only average.  We will return to try their fish, looked and smelled pretty good.
