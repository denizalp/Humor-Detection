I dragged Minerva in here the other day after catching a whiff of their delightful waffle cones while out for a stroll.  After much deliberation, I decided upon the apple pie yoghurt.  Minerva was being somewhat cantankerous and I suggested that the white chocolate cinnamon habanero might cheer her up, but she \"didn't need any cheering up, thank you very much, Albus.\" :(\n\nAnyhow, she refused to get anything, the party pooper, but my flavour was smashing!  Like the pie had been transfigured into ice cream right in the back of their quaint shoppe! Magic indeed.
