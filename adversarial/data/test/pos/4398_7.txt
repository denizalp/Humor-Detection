I love nook! And this was my first time at the downtown location. I was actually stunned at how gorgeous it is. I love the Arcadia location but this felt different! We were greeted promptly and chose a table near the window to look at the grey afternoon. Mom and I had just seen Ballet Arizona's performance of the Nutcracker and were in the mood for some quick lunch before we went Christmas shopping. Our server was cute and fun and provided a great experience for us. We started with the poutine- and folks you really got to spring for the fried egg on top. Adds such a delicious flavor throughout the dish. I had to literally push the plate away from me otherwise I would have eaten the entire thing and licked the plate. The gravy and cheese curds are so deliciously bad! \n\nI repented by ordering the Harvest Quinoa salad. The presentation was beautiful and mixing all the ingredients together with that delicious dressing was really a home run. We also got two pizzas to take with us I ordered the Funghi with sausage and my mom ordered the Quattro Fromaggio. I love the thin flakey crust and the flavors are so evenly distributed, making every bite a winner.\n\nCan't forget my cocktail! I ordered the Sultry Sage (or something like that) and it was sweet and strong and perfectly foamy from the egg whites!
