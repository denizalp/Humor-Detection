The best Peruvian I've ever had! We shared Oxtail with gravy and sunny side up egg; shrimp, fish and scallop ceviche; octopus; filet mignon lomo saltado; charcuterie; churro bon bon; flan; passion fruit sorbet; and each had about 3-4 pisco sours. The service and food were truly sensational. Will be back for sure.
