Lake Jacqueline  with its charming swans, playful geese, Disneyesque ducks, and laid back turtles brings residents from the corners of the Las Vegas Valley to this ethereal finger lake of the northwest Valley community of Desert Shores. I am one of them.  Lake Jacqueline is one of the ethereal places I visit to nourish my spirit. I enjoy my secret bench where I can release the negativity of the world. Sitting on the bench overlooking Lake Jacqueline is a front row show to nature's performance of the sun setting or rising over the magnificent Red Rock mountains. Deep in the night it is a front row seat to the moon and stars glowing over a serene lake. In daylight it is the front row seat to the charming swans, playful geese, Disneyesque ducks, laid back turtles with the occasional model sailboats and non-motorized watercraft. \n\n  The peculiar thing about this ethereal Lake is that in my estimate the public only has twenty percent access to the shoreline. Bordering the lake from its south-eastern shoreline at Regatta and Mariner to its northwestern shoreline at Desert Shoals are luxury homes. The developers of Desert Shores created breathtaking areas for the public to enjoy the lake. They are picture postcard scenic spots. From the extreme most southeastern and northwestern shorelines the public can stop, listen, and corroborate. My secret bench is somewhere in these spots. Without fail ducks and waterfowl entertain people from these picture postcard spots. Spanning the center of Lake Jacqueline the Breakwater bridge is a prime viewing spot. \n\n  Lake Jacqueline is a place I visit to likewise nourish my physical health. The Desert Shore roadways circumventing the vicinity of Lake Jacqueline and sister finger lakes is a suitable track for jogging, running, and yes hiking. I enjoy my walks around the lake, especially when I burn off calories. \n\n  Lake Jacqueline is a place that is worthy of review 600. I couldn't wait ten more reviews to put it on the Yelp map. It is an ethereal place I wanted to share with the world today.
