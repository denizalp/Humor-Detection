After several more outings, I need to dog on the dog park.  The park is great, however, the other dog owners are not.  I really don't understand why people think it is appropriate to sit and talk on a mobile phone while their dog runs amok.  After a couple altercations, I have had enough.  I got into it with one girl who was not supervising her giant dog that kept \"mouthing\" my puppy's entire head.  He was terrified.  I told her to get control of her dog.  Response?  \"Maybe you should take your dog over to the passive dog area, you just don't understand how dogs play.\"  \"Are you kidding me?  My dog is not passive.  You just need to control your dog.\"  \"He's just playing, yesterday he had a whole Pug in is mouth and that dog was fine.\"  Brilliant reasoning.  I left after that exchange, which I promise you is almost verbatim, and have not been back.
