I have been coming here as a regular since 2010!! And my experiences have always been top notch. The owners Jim and his wife Pam are very friendly and care about your dining experience. I usually sit at the bar so that I can watch TV and talk but I want to give Kudos to Matt, Keith, Rita, Evelyn and Marina!! If you want to have good time and great meal without breaking your bank then please give Girves Brown Derby in Lyndhurst a chance!!! The cajun crusted salmon is the bomb!! The baked potatoes are huge and the filet medallions are tender and seasoned well. This is my home away from home!!
