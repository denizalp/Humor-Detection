How have I never reviewed the Regal Cinemas at Red Rock 16??\n\nObviously located in the Red Rock Casino, the Red Rock 16 theater is a decent, if not necessarily spectacular, little movie theater. I am a Regal fan and have been a card carrying card member of their points club for over 10 years now. So I do prefer to patronize Regal whenever possible.\n\nOne big knock on this place is the seating. I must be getting spoiled because I am less than satisfied with any kind of seating that is not a recliner. Anytime I see a movie without a recliner, the seating is typically not very comfortable. Same here unfortunately. \n\nAlso, the concessions (namely the popcorn) is not very good, IMO. I'm not even complaining about the price. You're going to pay too much no matter what theater you go to, but the popcorn quality is just not very good here.\n\nAll that being said, the screens look great and the sound is good too. \n\nHonestly, I think you'd be best served if you drove 1 mile or so south and went to Regal Summerlin 5 in Downtown Summerlin. That theater is one of the best in the city, even if it is a bit pricey!\n\nRed Rock 16 is a-ok though. You could do better. You could do worse.\n\n\n3 stars.\n\nA-Ok.
