This is a spot for seafood lovers who don't care about decor or service beyond the basics. Food is mostly what I care about so I was pleasantly surprised after passing this restaurant probably over 100 times. \nWe ordered grilled octopus, garlic grilled giant shrimp, a fried whole snapper, rice, and salad. Each preparation was well done and I loved the herbaceous notes: parsley, za'atar, and in the olive oil (you can find pictures by others, I was too hungry to think of it). The process seems maybe a little odd to a first-time client but it's easy: go to the counter in the back to pick your seafood and sides, take your number and find a table, wait for your food! The sauces on the grilled items is also good for dipping using the complementary bread. Service is basic but courteous, so don't be intimidated by something new - give it a shot!
