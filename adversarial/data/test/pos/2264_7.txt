As with my fellow yelpers, I came here with a dream of cheap steak. A simple dream that has inspired mankind for generations. In this regard, my search was stymied by the cold, harsh axe of reality.\n\nThe good:\n- Prices weren't exorbitant. Not cheap, but not awful\n- The steak was tasty\n- They serve HP sauce. If it's good enough for the Queen - and it does bear her seal - it's damned well good enough for you\n- The waiter was good. Not record breaking, but I didn't feel ignored.\n\nThe bad:\n- This is not a steakhouse. This is a family restaurant\n- Some of the menu is either no longer offered or redacted for those of us with a low security clearance. In the first case, it's really cheesy to block out parts of the menu with black ink, stickers or white out (our menus all had variations of the three) when photocopies cost a nickel. In the second case, I'm just scared.\n- Apart from the HP sauce, the condiments were a bit sketchy, most notably the ketchup bottle, which was held together with packing tape and most definitely not Heinz. Not. Cool.\n- \"All Day\" breakfast apparently uses either some definition of \"day\" or \"all\" that is entirely new to me, because they end that at noon.\n- The cauliflower tasted weird. Like, really weird. \n\nThe weird-but-fine:\n- Those who asked for onions or mushrooms, basically would up with an entire meal of such. Which is fine in that there's no chance they wouldn't have enough, but seems a bit of a waste.\n\nThe upshot:\nIf I was in the area again, I could be convinced to come back.
