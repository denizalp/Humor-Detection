I have been here more than a handful of times and I really WANT to like ...No! I want to LOVE this place ... but I can't get over how dirty it feels when ever I am here. I love the menu, which is very English to me... Lots of pasty options. But when a place is dirty and sticky, I can't get around the fact that my food is likely not prepared in the most hygienic of states either. This past week we opted for this for a quick bite while we found ourselves in Tempe.. again, I like the menu and there are a few ciders, mine wasn't cold and ciders need to be icy to be tasty. I wasn't wow'd by the Oven Chips.. a version of the French Fry, which were drenched in oil and not one bit of crisp.. my Guinness Stew Pasty was lackluster, but it sounded great on the food splattered menu..  and again... this place is filthy, downright to the disgusting bathrooms. Pass.
