Rude as fuck! My fiance called about ordering and we asked when they closed because we didn't want to be assholes and order 10 min before they closed.\nANYWAY, she told us at 11 and he said oh, you close in a half hour?\nHer reply? \"Yup, thank you. Bye\"\nUm excuse me? What the fuck is that? Is that really how you run your business? Rude Asians with no manners and apparently no business knowledge.
