This restaurant and the 933 Group are NOT family friendly. We arrived here on a Monday evening at 6:20pm were seated by a hostess and just being given menus by the waitress when the on duty manager walked up and started explaining their no minors after 7pm policy as was on the website. When I protested it was before 6:30pm (the time of their last seating) and that there were many other families here he still proceeded to take the menus away and tell us we could not stay citing licensing etc. I got irate and admittedly used profanity as he was being completely unreasonable and made my 2.5 year old daughter feel like she was unwelcome despite all the other children eating their dinner. When I escalated the matter I got a pathetic one sentence apology then a paragraph saying they determined their manager followed policy despite directly stating in the same email that he did no follow policy as their last minor seating was at 6:30pm. I then escalated further on the phone to operations manager Jamie Mansour who did nothing but adamantly defend his lying night manager who apparently indicated he was going to allow us to stay but did not because of my use of profanity. This is a bald faced lie as I only got upset after he forced us to get up from our table, why should I have just left quietly? I can see the operations manager is of the same breed as his on duty manager. He referred to me as sweetheart and missy and young lady multiple times in our phone conversation, completely inappropriate things to call a woman and a mother. He never once focuses on the fact that they as a service industry had failed miserably but instead berated me for my use of profanity. Well in my books calling me \"sweatheart\" is 10 times more insulting then calling a ahole an ahole. Please do not give these family unfriendly pigs your business.
