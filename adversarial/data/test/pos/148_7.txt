Meh.  Not in a bad way.  The food and atmosphere are decent in a \"This is my Dad's favorite restaurant\" kind of way.\n\nYou won't be wowed by anything but you probably won't get anything bad either - food, service...it's all safe in a bland sort of way.\n\nGlad we had a Groupon.  If we had paid full price I might not have been as satisfied...
