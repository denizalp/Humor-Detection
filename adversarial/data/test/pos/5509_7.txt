My dear husband surprised me with auto detailing for my Hyundai Accent and booked it today. First of all, this team goes straight to hard work the second they arrive with their specially equipped trailer. My poor little new car was blessed with a lovely chicken stew on the back seat a while back. Someone carried a baby shower's worth of stew and was hungry so he took the turns in a frenetic way. It was his Mom's car (me) but if I spilled in his Mustang?? I would be toast.\nIt is hard to tell it ever happened now!\nMy car is amazing!! I highly recommend this couple- helpful, superior customer service and beaucoup diligence for the restoration of the car.
