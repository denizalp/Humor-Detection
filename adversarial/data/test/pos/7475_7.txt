I like tilted kilt.\n\nThe food is always just ok\n\nThe drinks are usually good. \n\nThe servers are usually good. \n\nI like the kilt attire. \n\nWe had some apps:\nnachos, the fixins are ok, chips got soggy\nwings, good but nothing great\nsausage bites, good but you only can eat 1 or 2\ncheese sticks, meh they are there\nrings, looked ok\n\nI had a burger and it was better then in the past. It was missing the cheese, lettuce and tom but the meat was good. \n\nThe meal was free but the prices were ok. \n\n3.5 rounded up for good service and views.
