Visited this location for lunch today as it is near my office. Ordered my usual mahi-mahi bowl and it had the same quality and flavor I've grown to know Tokyo Joe's for. For it being lunch hour, they also were pretty quick with getting me my meal. They now serve poke bowls which is pretty neat. I will definitely be back for one of those.\n\nOh, and the pomegranate green tea is fantastic!
