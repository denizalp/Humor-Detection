Pretty decent. The fact that it is open 24 hours is convenient for those late night cravings. The burritos are a great value for the price and quantity. They come huge and loaded. They do offer smaller items but a variety that will keep food lovers happy! This is just a walk up window area but does have some out dooor seating area. Mostly recommended for in the go.
