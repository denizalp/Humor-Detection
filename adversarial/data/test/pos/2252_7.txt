I love stores like this. Not because I'm an Apple fan-boy, but because these guys understand. They believe in their product! \n\nIf you don't already know, within a year of contract signing, Apple will replace your iPhone if it's damaged (unless accidental). If you have a cracked case, they don't just replace your case, they replace the entire phone and you get a brand new one! WOW! \n\nSo we all might have experienced our fair share of holiday shopping meltdowns. It's a nightmare and causes the best of us to scream \"Wait your effking turn\" at the sweet old lady \"who just had a question about where the bathroom is. That black Friday nightmare is kind of what the Apple store is, Everyday! \n\nFor that very reason, the appointment system works and works well. No more fussing and cussing. You can set up an appointment on the phone or in store. Show up, check in with the friendly host and get on with your business. \n\nLess than a minute after checking in, I was assisted by an awesome employee. She was extremely cheerful and her voice wasn't monotone and didn't cause a momentary lapse of reason. I for once actually understood everything a salesperson told me. Not only was she simply awesome, she hooked me up with some sweet insider info!! (PM me for details and get your mind outta the gutter!! ;P) \n\n10 minutes later I was on my way, outta there with a new phone. Another epic win for Apple!
