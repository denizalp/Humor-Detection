I've been wanting to try pierogis for a long time.  Finally we had the opportunity because of the International Supper Club.  We had a huge turn out, so our table had about 15 people.  Even though we were so many and each paying separate bills, the wait staff was very nice.  My husband and I decided to try the 12 piece platter, since you can choose them in 3s, we decided to try the potato and cheddar, jalape√±o and cheddar, chicken and farmers cheese and potato. We chose to have them pan fried instead of boiled.  Everything is better fried, don't you think?  The platter came with sour cream, bacon bits and caramelized onions.  The pierogis were delicious,  I washed them down with a European Sparkling Pear Juice.  So yummy.  We also ordered dessert, we had the 6 pierogis 3 apple and 3 sweet farmers cheese and poppyseed roll.  The sweet farmers cheese ones were not my cup of tea, but I didn't pick them, so I was fine with only trying a corner.  We will definitely want to come back.  We were going to take some home from the market next door, but we decided to hang out with some friends after, so we didn't want the pierogis to melt.  Next time I will bring them home.
