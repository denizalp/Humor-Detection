This place is just ok...\n\nI really wanted to love this place, being Mexican, it's hard to find good food here that's up to par with my own. The employees really stand out, they're sooo nice and accommodating. I've tried a lot of items on their menu, but all with carne asada so I can give my input on that at least.\n\nCarne asada fries - crinkle fries topped with guac, sour cream, cheese, pico, and your choice of meat. What I would def do is not use crinkle fries! They are seriously the worst fry to use. Please use a normal French fry instead! Also, the sour cream they use is like a regular sour cream from what I tasted, instead I would opt for crema Mexicana, it'll definitely improve this dish x100! They are also kinda stingy with the carne asada, I'm paying 6.50$ for this plate, give me some more meat please! The guac here is fresh, but just doesn't hit the spot. There is not enough cilantro, jalapeno, or even garlic salt. It's super bland! The best carne asada fries are going to be from El Gordo.  5$ for half an order, but they come with double the fries, and do not skimp on the meat! \nPlain cheese quesadilla - It's pretty hard to mess up a quesadilla. LOL.\nMini tacos - For 2$ you get a corn tortilla with your choice of meat. Again we did CA, and during our second visit the meat in our nachos and tacos were luke warm so it kinda ruined the meal. I know 2$ doesn't seem much, but I think for the amount of meat given they should maybe lower it to 1.50 like all the other places who sell street tacos and have piping hot meat off the grill. Also, you have to ask for limes.\nCA Nachos - I got these sans beans and pico. IDK why but I've never had nachos with beans. Again the meat was scarce and warm, guac was bland, but the chips were good. 6.50 for this plate also. \nElote - 2$ for this deliciousity. I'm assuming it comes with butter, cheese, and powdered chile. I wanted to love this corn, but it was just ok. It needed something else. IDK if they do not use mayo, but it didn't taste like it. I also got a piece that was a little too charred and was a little cold.\n\nThe d√©cor is super cute, alas some of the tables are awkward because they are from the old Pizza Hut. They're super large so if you are sitting across from each other it's a reach. I would replace those babies. \n\nThis place has a ton of potential, we have gone 2wice, but I honestly make better food at my own home for a fraction of the cost. \n\nLike I said, they have awesome lovely employees, it's just some of the food was super bland.\nYay!
