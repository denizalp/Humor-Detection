A while back this place showed up on a search in my neighborhood for new breakfast places and I bookmarked it noting it would have to be a place I went to when not opening until 6;30 would be OK.\n\nI was the only customer in the place until just before I finished.  Kelly, my server was pleasant and the only problem was she gave me a couple of minutes to look over the menu which turned into about 5 because she was chatting with the manager who was in my line of sight as I set down the menu and started playing with my phone. The remainder of the service was good.\n\nThe food was good with one exception. Two cooks, one customer and the timing of the plating was off. They serve toast with soft butter on the side and the toast was stone cold and even though I spread the butter immediately it never did melt in to the bread. Now that I know I may ask them to butter it right out of the toaster next time.\n\nI prefer sitting in a chair at a table and the whole restaurant is set up that way. Sort of like not having a bad seat in the house. :) It is obviously a chain but I liked it and will probably go back again to try a couple of the other items that looked good on the menu.\n\n3.49 stars
