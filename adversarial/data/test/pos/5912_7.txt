Came in tonight to a nearly deserted restaurant. Our party was large but overall we did not have a complex order. Our appetizers took about an hour to finally receive finishing everything.  We ordered only a few different ones, yuzu pork belly(extremely small portion...4 1\" square pieces of pork belly for $5!) Chicken wings, which were the ones to take so long, we ordered 8 orders and received half after about 30 minutes. The other half arrived after we were nearly done with our ramen. They had no flavor, all i could taste was charred chicken.\n\nOn to the main course.. the ramen. \nAll of the broth we tried was very WRONG. \n\nTonkotsu ramen\nThe epitome of what many consider to be ramen, tastes nothing like I have ever tasted at any ramen place. Bland and uninspired. Noodles undercooked. Pork belly burnt. Not enough soup in the bowl, toppings short of making a wholesome bowl. \n\nSpicy miso ramen\n\nThe same review as you see above stands for this ramen. It was hard to even sense any flavor added from the miso,  in fact it didn't even appear to be a different soup from the tonkotsu at all!\n\nTom Yam\n\nAll of the above stands for this ramen. Only order this if you absolutely LOVE the taste of lemongrass. As that is all you will ever taste out of this ramen.\n\nGangnam ramen.\n\nSupposedly a Korean ramen. Again, noodles undercooked. Not a single piece of kimchi in the soup,  despite it being listed as an ingredient. In fact, i'd wager that no kimchi was used at all in the production of this soup. It tastes like they pour a little cholula into their Tonkotsu and call it good.\n\nNow let's hit on some drinks. The selection is extremely poor for a Japanese restaurant. Only a few offerings available that are japanese. And the price, wow. $9 for a large Asahi. It's sad to report that the Asahi was the best tasting item served at this restaurant. I was really hoping for something good to finally be in the phoenix area, but those hopes are dashed.
