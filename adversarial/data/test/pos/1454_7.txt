I really liked this gym at first. Close to my home, monthly price was good but once I stared working out here I changed my mind.\n\nCons: staff rude and not helpful\nWay to small. Sometimes have to wait 10 minutes for a machine.\n\nPro: clean\n\nCalled to cancel my membership and I was hung up on. Goes back to the staff. \n\nEOS is coming by my house! Prices are great and the space in the gym is awesome! Team EOS
