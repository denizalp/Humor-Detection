This place committed just about all of the worse offenses a restaurant can. First, my group's waiter seemed to be bothered by us because we walked in when the place was empty (you'd think they would be excited to have a chance to make a tip). Second, I ordered the spicy scallop roll and after eating one piece of it I called the waiter over and told them that the scallop was bad (rancid!). My tables waiter then proceeded to yell over to the sushi chef that I said the scallops were not bad, and the chef argued with me. Now, this is when I got extremely P.O.ed and told them to take the roll back, don't bring anything else, and don't charge me. Lucky they agreed or they would have been hearing from me again the next day when I was sick to my stomach. I can only imagine what would have happened to me had I eaten more than one piece...Don't risk your life by trying this dive...
