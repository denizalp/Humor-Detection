I love Jose Andres but perhaps my expectations were just a bit too high.  Bazaar Meats emphasizes their massive cuts of meat and 3 pound ribeyes, but Jaleo does many of the same or similar sides and apps better. I'd go back to Jaleo for better versions of everything except the meat dishes. Come hungry and leave the vegetarians at home.\n\nDRINKS\nJose's G&T is always a good start, but the LN2 (more like an alcoholic sorbet than a drink) comes with fun tableside presentation. Did not care for Jose's Vespa or the Hemmingway.\n\nSTARTERS & SIDES\nFerran Adria Olives, Modern & Traditional: Got these again after loving the concept at Jaleo, but they were not as appreciated by our dining companions\n*The Classic Tartare: easily one of the best dishes we had, one I would come back for. Made tableside and seasoned to your preference, the beef sirloin comes from retired dairy cows and is supremely flavorful. \nVittore 1950 Carpaccio: accidentally received this after ordering the bison buffalo version, but kept it. A well-done classic with parmesan, croutons, capers, and sherry. I would still like to try the buffalo version eventually.\nThe Lhardy's Madrid Beef (soup): served in a tiny teacup, the consommé, quail egg, sherry, and caviar were underwhelming. Wouldn't get this again, it doesn't really work, and I don't understand why it's on the menu.\nA simple tomato salad: There is such a thing as being too simple. Three or four cubes of various sweeter tomatoes, plus a light dressing and red onion. I liked the unusual selection of tomatoes but this dish seemed to be missing something. \n*S'mores: Homemade graham crackers and marshmallows plus chocolate and foie gras? This was a surprise hit with our more conservative dining partners! Should have asked for this at the end of the meal as it was better than the desserts we had and less fittingly placed as a starter course.\n\nMEATS\nMerino Lamb Rack, New Zealand: The version at Jaleo is better. This was unevenly seasoned, rendering some of the chops almost bland. The chimmichurri sauce Jaleo's version is plated with would have elevated this dish.\n*Wagyu Beef Cheeks: Tender and flavorful meat was complemented by the citrus and slightly-spicy mojo rojo, which I wish there was more of (as others have said). Good choice.\n*Braised Lamb Neck: Perfectly medium-rare lamb, juicy and well seasoned, plus fried oysters and fried potatoes. The oyster catsup was unnecessary because all of the other components were so well done. Recommend!\n\nDESSERT\nEverything is itty-bitty bite-sized, making our usual habit of sharing dessert difficult. The tiramisu crème puff disappointed the person who chose it, while the raspberry yuzu tart was interesting and fun. By far the favorite was the sea salt caramel crisp. \n\nService was friendly and informative, if a touch too casual. The tableside presentation was fun, and the guy who worked with us was personable. Note that there are three (great-sounding) tiered tasting menus, from $150\/pp to $275, this information is not present on the website.\n\nPart of having the best experience here is going with the right group of people, and unfortunately the couple we dined with didn't seem to enjoy many of the items. My rating is rounded up to 4 stars from what is more accurately 3.5, as that is partially my fault. Less than half of our dishes (admittedly mostly classic options) were wonderful, while the other half was disappointing. I'll come back to split a steak with my guy (and try the cotton candy foie!), but I'm not in a rush to do so.
