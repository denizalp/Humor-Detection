The service here was subpar extremely unfriendly while we waited to be seated. After we had our orders taken the manager then proceeded to vacuum the dining area while we were eating our \"shareables\" and waiting for  food for an extremely long time period. Our server then ran off to take a smoke break right after our food was delivered but felt the need to tell us she was going on break to smoke. Also while eating made many mistakes with our groups orders and drink refills.
