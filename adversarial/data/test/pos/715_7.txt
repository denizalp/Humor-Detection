One of the highlights of my Las Vegas vacation was when we visited the Fremont Street Experience in Old Town Las Vegas. The original hotel Casino row such as The Golden Nugget, Four Queens, The Plaza and Fremont Hotels are located here. The Mob Museum is also situated close by and ideal to visit if you are inclined to understand Las Vegas history.\n\nIt was also great to watch the hourly light and music show projected over the street covered canopy while sipping our oversized Frozen Margarita. The street shows, performers and art installations kept us preoccupied the entire night. There are two levels and two types of zip line to be had, its worth a try if you're at it.\n\nI really enjoyed my time here and I truly appreciated the entertainment value it offers to visitors. The crowd was less here than on the Strip. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends to visit whenever in Vegas.
