I don't like dealing with prescriptions. I don't like having to ask questions of pharmacists. It's just intimidating. But the folks running this CVS do a wonderful job connecting with customers and getting us the help we need.\n\nMy husband and I went in there months ago when he was suffering with debilitating allergies. We were given a recommendation for a behind-the-counter option that quelled his symptoms.\n\nWhile we were there, the pharmacist quickly filled my personal prescription (which wasn't due for pickup until the following day). She also set it up to be automated moving forward, which was a nice touch.\n\nLater, I was *dying* of sinus pressure accompanied by nausea and dizziness. No fun, especially if you're active and about to go out of town! I swung by and asked the pharmacist (Gosh, I love her) and she recommended sudafed. Instant relief. I was blown away.\n\nSo if you're looking for a sweet little place to have your prescription and OTC needs met in a friendly, efficient environment, look no further. I won't consider going anywhere else! (Plus, it's right across from Trader Joe's, where you can get all your health foods...holistic living for the win!)
