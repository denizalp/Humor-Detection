Went here for Deadmau5 concert on a Saturday.\n\nLoved the idea of the cabanas\/booths being right by the pool & being able to dance in the water or just being able to sit & dip my feet in.\n\nWe got there at midnightish but still got in free. There's alot of places to sit even if you have no booth. We didn't get to check out the actual club because when we were heading over to that area we got stuck in a mosh pit crowd. Sooooo crowded & everyone was pushing. I was not having it. We went back to the area where we were chillin' at & stayed there for the remainder of the time. Trying to dance to EDM, TRYING! oi.\n\nAny advice? Leave a little earlier to make sure you don't get stuck in a massive taxi line, IT WAS RIDIC!
