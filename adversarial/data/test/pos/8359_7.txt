if someone flag this review i will be very pissed off.\ni'm not kidding, i didn't watch any horror movie, we weren't drunk, and i'm not that imaginative either. but i'm asian, and yes supernatural exists, go to bali if you don't trust me, and what happened here is still somewhat nothing compared to bali.\n\ni got the spa suite a week ago, to be precise, it's room 12860\n\nit was our first night in vegas, so when we saw the room, we THOUGHT it was okay, but as soon as we moved to caesar's palace and hard rock, that room was like shit, but still better and cheaper that mgm though\n\nhere's the problem, believe it or not, this hotel (especially this room) is haunted. laugh if you want, i don't care. i'm writing this review for those of you who are \"sensitive\" so that you won't be attacked in here\n\nthe suite consists of the living room and the bedroom with jacuzzi, i slept in the living room and nothing happened to me (or probably because i slept so deep) but they who sleep in the bedroom were attacked the whole night\n\nmy sister slept next to the jacuzzi and it was dry, we cleaned it out, there were no sound for like hours but around 3am, the water started to pour again and stop and pour again and stop, just like someone is teasing her, then her blanket were pulled down gradually (it just doesn't makes sense at all for a blanket to go down with an interval) she grabbed back the blanket and she felt by herself that someone is pulling down the blanket, as soon as she grabbed the blanket, something grabbed her leg and pulled her down. she struggled and kicked but there were nothing to kick and suddenly every kind of terror disappeared. that's what happened to the bed next to jacuzzi\n\nfor the next bed that's located far from jacuzzi, there were these twin sisters of my girlfriend's who throughout the night heard the sound of cellphone interference through a speaker. the problem is, we didn't put our cellphone next to the bed, and afaik, there were no speakers at all near them. the final blow here is that one of the twins were physically twisted to the other way around by a certain of force, it's like being rolled forcibly\n\nlaugh if you want. but hey, different people experience different life. i wasnt born sensitive about this issue but they were born sensitive. so you might not be born sensitive but im sure my review will benefit someone else who's \"sensitive\"\n\n2 stars for cheap rate and decent room (at least for me)
