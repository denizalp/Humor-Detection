I've had this place on my to-do list for quite some time. Since I've been here in Vegas, I've gotten to try quite a few gelato places. And I have to say that this place disappointed me. I guess I had high expectations because of all the good reviews. \n\nI will say that the couple (who I assume owns the place?) was over the top sweet and welcoming. Talk about super friendly and helpful! \n\nWhile the flavors that were offered sounded fun and some were unique, none of them tasted particularly sweet. They all tasted very bland. So disappointing.
