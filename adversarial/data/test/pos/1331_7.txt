Simply the best strawberry ice cream around! I'm usually a mint chocolate kind of guy, but at this place I always go for the strawberry! I've had a few other flavors here but they just don't compare.\n\nThe strawberry ice cream is unbelievably smooth and creamy. It has just the right amount of sweetness and tartness from the frozen bits of strawberry. Best of all, this place is very reasonably priced compared to Sweet Moses or Mitchell's. I recently found out that they offer an even smaller portion than the junior, dubbed the \"golf ball\" for only $1! Great for days where you want dessert but still full from dinner\/lunch\/breakfast.
