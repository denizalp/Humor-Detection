This isn't a very good place for guys who want short haircut. The place looks nice after renovation and I thought for a place this nice, the service and hairstylist must be pretty good but i was wrong! My hairstylist is a mid age lady who cuts my hair as if she is shaving skin off a potato. I was in and out within 30 minutes and my hair doesn't even look nice at all. This place is definitely not worth a $25+ tip, go somewhere else instead.
