#1. There were (4) of us eating here. My Dad's food was brought out first. The second dish was brought out about 15 minutes later followed by the rest of the food coming out of the kitchen about 20-25 minutes from the initial time they served my Dad. Ridiculous! No body ate at the same time....I can't imagine what it'd be like with a big party! \n\n#2. I did like the Lumpia Shanghai and thought I'd order a party tray and pick up. I ordered on 2\/17 in the morning and requested pick up at 12pm  on 2\/18 the day of my  potluck @ work. I called and informed them I was on my way. The lady said \"Okay\". Then I get a call back...It was a lady speaking Tagalog! Um, excuse me, but how do you even know I'm Filipino?!? Anyway, I told her I don't speak Tagalog and she basically just said that they didn't have enough lumpia for my order, that they used it the night before!!!!! WTF!!!\n\nI drove about 25 minutes from my work, almost 5 minutes from reaching the restaurant....and they decide to tell me RIGHT BEFORE MY ARRIVAL!!!!!! Not only did I not have anything to bring for the Potluck...but EVERYONE was expecting the lumpia...so disappointing!!!!! Plus the gas and time I wasted!!!!!\n\nTASTE: Eh....I did like the Lumpia Shanghai.....but it's not worth going there just for one item & I'm not willing to spend more money to find out about the rest of the menu.
