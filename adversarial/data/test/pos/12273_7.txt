It's like the Great American Novel, but like....a backrub? Is that it? \n\nIf the name doesn't throw you, the prices sure will. Considering they're not even offering you a MASSAGE but just a backrub. And I don't know about you, but paying someone $14 for a ten minute back rub (or rub ANYWHERE on my body for that matter) is just not worth it. No matter how desperate for human contact I may be on that day.\n\nThis is just one of many of these places spread out around the city which sure, if you're a douche-bag Bay street guy, you might enjoy as a lunch perk to show how corporate you are. \"Look at me! I get back rubs! I'm so tense! Where's my Red Bull?!\"\n\nBut really? They're just gimmicks; endless massage oils, massage \"aids\", etc. for sale and just a couple massage chairs and maybe a private room (for 35$\/half hour minimum) otherwise open to the passer-by's on their way to the subway. HOW RELAXING! I love hanging my head into a circular pillow while a stranger rubs my back and other strangers walk by just feet away and peer at me \"relaxing\"......AMERICAN-styles. \n\nIt's the kind of place you just know massage therapist students fresh out of college get a job at just to get experience and then LEAVE as soon as they've got enough to put on their resumes. Or worse.....people who aren't certified at all...
