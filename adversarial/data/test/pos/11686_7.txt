Came to see The Chainsmokers. Bought pre-sale tickets to stand in line for an hour. Heavy handed security coming in took random items, it's not clear what is and isn't OK to have. Good thing the line was so slow, 'the divas' didn't take to the stage until 2 freaking am... people were getting pissed waiting. I felt bad for people that spent thousands on tables. For that price, big artists should have better stamina. Meh. \n\nThe club itself is nice, ok, but the guest experience just absolutely sucks. MAJOR over serving going on, despite the drinks being insanely overpriced, even for Vegas. Many, many drunk and obnoxious people with dangerously dainty security on the inside. \n\nDuring the minute my husband was in the bathroom, a man put his hands on me and 'jokingly' tried to push me in the pool. I told him off before my husband got back, but I watched security allow him to continue drunkenly stumbling around the edge of the pool making his rounds harassing women. Part of the evenings entertainment\/worry\/horror was watching security allow drunk white men to fall into the pool constantly and splash women. I clutched my $25 double titos and sipped slowly all night, watching the sloppy men around me like a hawk so that their wobbly missteps wouldn't make me suddenly go for a swim. \n\nPlease have a heart XS. The $17(!!!!) bottled water incentivizes dehydration and that is just so freakin irresponsible. Never in my life will I go back to a place where the water is $17 damn dollars. \n\nSorry Chainsmokers, you've got to deal with the golden cuffs of a stick up their ass club for the next three years. Oy. Guess I'll have to wait for a few more albums to see them again... \n\nVegas nightclub competition is fierce, there are plenty of other great nightclubs that won't charge you a couple hundred bucks to feel like a peasant. Guest experience matters for everyone, and from what I'm reading from other reviews bottle service doesn't even make you feel special.\n\nXS: Vegas $$$ extraction machine
