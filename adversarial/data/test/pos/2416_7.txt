We really like Thai and wanted to try a place we had not been to yet.  In looking for places and reading reviews, I came across this place that had a review written by Nate M. about 3 months ago.  It was a decent review, he gave it 4 stars so it had to be a decent place.\n\nThe place is tucked in the corner of this L shaped shopping center on Sunset east of the 95.  The Penn was a little hard to see but the Thai House is very prominent.\n\nThey have 8 booths and a few tables which where put together as two long tables going down the center.  There was one other booth with 3 people and one table was taken with 4 people.  It seemed liked there was only one lady working the room and from time to time another lady brought out food, she looked like she was in the back cooking.\n\nI ordered the Egg Rolls to start and even though the were very crispy in the outside, the were soggy on the inside and obviously not made there, they all looked identical.  These were not really to my liking so I won't order those again.  \n\nWe also ordered the green papaya salad which was very good and almost identical to a place in Oceanside we love.  We also got the mixed vegetable with chicken and the Pad Thai.  Both dishes were excellent.  The sauce on the mixed vegetable was AMAZING, it was not a heavy sauce and was very week made.  The Pad Thai was very good as well.\n\nThis is a place we will go back to, everything tasted fresh, the vegetables were crispy and overall the price was very reasonable.
