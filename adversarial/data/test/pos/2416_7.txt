Shake machine not working?  And no lids for small cups? Didn't they just open this place? \nAnnoying first visit. \nI'm writting as I sit in the drive through waiting for my food window is open and I can hear the manager saying goddammit and workers swearing.\nI rather drive a long way to a classier Rallys I waited so long for this one to open and I'm not happy. You need professional workers.
