I've been struggling with back issues for the last 10 or so years. I finally bit the bullet and got an MRI and discovered that I not only have a herniated disc but I also have three other pretty aggressively degenerating discs. Awesome. I'm 35 with the spine of a 50 year old.\n\nDr. Bassewitz was recommended by several folks at my gym so I went to see him after my back started acting up again. I was able to get in to see him rather quickly and he was super friendly during our appointment. He's the doctor who is the expert. He wasn't condescending but very clear and honest. I appreciated how forthright he was about my back and it's issues. He was the same with a treatment plan.\n\nHe's not one of those doctors who is going to rush you to the table. Although I could have surgery, he wants me to be able to live the active lifestyle I currently enjoy. He referred me an aggressive physical therapy plan and then I'm following up in four weeks. Surgery will always be there as an option and I like that I trust the person who might the one holding the knife.
