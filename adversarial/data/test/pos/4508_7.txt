You go for gas to fill up quickly and to be on your way, not to question whether you'll make it out alive. \n\nSeriously, this is one of the scariest gas stations in Ohio City. I know, because the other, slightly-less terrifying gas station up the street is a regular stop for me. Clearly, I'm not afraid of sketchy gas stations. But this one? \n\nI wouldn't recommend going here alone if you're a female, unless you want to get heckled--and the bus station right next to it, which is tagged with gang symbols, is a great magnet for creeps. \n\nLike Yelper Mike N, if you're desperate and you need something late, this place is open 24 hours. Just watch your back.
