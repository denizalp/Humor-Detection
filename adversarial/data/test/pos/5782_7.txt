I am done.\n\nI keep trying to give them more chances.  Maybe because the rent is cheaper than elsewhere, maybe because I don't feel like packing and moving. \n\nBut I am done with their shit here.\n\nI've always gotten along with the office staff, but I have heard plenty of complaints about them.  \n\nMy last straw is the amount of noise you can hear.  These apartments have zero insulation.  I can hear my neighbors above me walking, shutting cabinets, running back and forth exercising, rolling a medicine ball.  I can hear them talking, I hear the guy calling his girlfriend a \"fucking idiot\" and them fighting.  I hear them \"making up\" after their fights.  Nice....\n\nI have 2 kids and I was FORCED to move when I lived on the second floor.  Talus Ranch would not reimburse me for moving costs or anything when I had the neighbor below me harassing me and even at one point yelling the word \"Bitch\" at my daughter.  But I figured for piece of mind, I would just move to the bottom floor so I wouldn't have to worry about my kids making any noise while playing during the day and having the police called on me.  During the middle of the day.  On a Saturday.  Ridiculous.\n\nAnyways, I moved into a different building, bottom floor.  I had 4 people living above me, 2 were small toddlers who ran around and made noise.  Not once did I complain.  When they moved out a couple moved in (my current above-me neighbors.)  They apparently are night people, wake me up when I'm sleeping, have had parties on Thursday nights, have their 2 yappy dogs left on the patio so the dogs crap out there instead of in their apartment I guess.  And not once has the office written them up.  They have woken my daughters up on school nights, and still the office doesn't want to call them to ask them to politely keep it down after 8pm.  \n\nEven though I was told I needed to have my daughters not play, run around, in the middle of the day.  I was told that there is no \"quiet hours here\".  All hours are quiet hours.\n\napparently not.\n\nOther fun tidbits to consider if you're even thinking about moving here....\n\nThey will nickel and dime you for everything.\n\n$$$$ for cable, even if you don't want it.  You must get it\n\n$$$$ to pay for your rent!!  They charge you extra for sending you a paper bill.  If you opt to have no paper bill, they still charge you $1 to pay online!  How stupid!    With about 24 rent checks per building x I don't know how many buildings, at least 10 or 20, they are making an easy $240 to $480 EXTRA every single month!  Just because they want to charge for us making a payment!\n\n$$$$ for pest control\n\n$$$$ for garbage collection, although the garbage areas are absolutely disgusting.  Full of rodents, bugs, ants, garbage laying next to the bins BECAUSE THE BINS ARE FULL, not because people can't throw them in.  Huge furniture, beds, couches, left by garbages for MONTHS.   The office continues to do nothing about it even when I informed them that there was a couch out there 2 months ago.  It's still there...almost 4 months later.  And now has a mattress next to it that has been there for over a month.\n\nDog crap is everywhere!  I have a large dog.  And I clean up after him every single time.  They even have blue doggie bags for you to use and people are so incredibly lazy that they can't pick up their own dog crap.  One lazy guy actually bags up his dog's poop, but then HANGS IT from the bag container!!  Instead of just walking the 20 feet to the garbage can!  Unbelievable.\n\nClassy people living here....\n\n\nSo I am not making it my personal mission to make sure everyone knows about the poor customer service of MAA.  I have complained to their corporate office more times that I can count.\n\nPay a little bit more and go elsewhere.  Maybe you will feel a little more valued as a customer as well.\n\nYou have been warned!
