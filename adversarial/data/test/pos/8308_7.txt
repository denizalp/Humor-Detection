This is honestly my favorite boba place in all of Vegas. You can't really hang out with friends and play games here but you get the best smoothie\/boba drinks. They have a wide variety of smoothies to choose from and you can mix and match whatever fruits you want. Prices are very reasonable, about $3.50 for a regular size, extra for boba\/jelly. I don't get the boba because I don't really like them but I do always get the jelly. Service is good enough.
