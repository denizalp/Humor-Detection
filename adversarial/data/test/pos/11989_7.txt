I just got back from my trip to Vegas and was very excited to be going to Hakkasan because of good things I had heard from a few of my friends. Boy was I mistaken. For starters, I had bottle service for a group of about 12 people (mainly girls) and had to wait quite a while to even be taken inside because someone named Joe was unable to be found (even though he is the person I was told to ask for when I got to the table reservation line). This wasn't that big of a deal, we just wanted to get in and start our night so we did think too much of the wait. \n\nOnce inside, we couldn't see anything in front of us. The club is SO dark and is honestly like finding your way through a maze. Not only is it difficult to maneuver your way around the club, but it's also so over-crowded that you can't take more than two steps without bumping into someone. \n\nWe finally got to a table and the guy who I'm assuming is 'Joe' asked us for a credit card and ID. Now this is where my real frustration starts. I explained to 'Joe' that my friend (who is male) volunteered to give his card, but it is a temporary one because his actual card got stolen while we were in Vegas. He said it wouldn't be a problem, called over the host and had me order our bottles. After about 45 minutes of waiting and wondering where the hell our bottles and mixers were, a 'manager' comes over with the host and starts telling me that the card is unacceptable because it doesn't have a name on it. So I simply asked why we were not told this information when I asked earlier and he looked at me and said, \"I don't need to deal with this. I'm canceling your bottle service. You can all go back outside and pay cover to get in.\" This is his response to my one little question...I think I deserved an explanation considering you're the supposed manager and YES, you actually do need to deal with this. We managed to get the money together to pay for the bottle service (which was about $3,000).\n\nWe started to enjoy our night and were having a little more fun considering the ordeal we just went through. About an hour later, we finished our bottles and the host had cleared up our table. We were all dancing around the empty table, some girls were on the table, and others were on the platform that surounds the booth seating. THIS is when the night took a turn for the worst. Not a single person came to tell the girls that they could not dance on the little empty table that once had our bottles on it, but the second my friend (the same guy who had the issue with the credit card) starts to dance on it, someone from the club walks up to him and literally PULLS him off the table. Luckily he didn't get hurt. It seemed like the entire security team had surrounded him because he apparently wasn't supposed to be dancing on that table and they thought he was going to get physical. Fortunately for the club, my friends are civil and know how to speak to people. We don't need to use force unlike the employee.\n\nAt this point, I asked to speak to a manager. Guess who the manager was? YUP, the same heavy set, hispanic man with glasses who gave us a hard time with the credit card AND who happened to be the same person to pull my friend off the table. HE is the manager? When we asked him the reasoning for doing what he did, he simply said, \"he had it coming...do you dance on your coffee table at home?\" That is the response a MANAGER of a club gives to paying patrons? NO. When asked to speak to a supervisor I was told there wasn't one working. So the only person I could speak to was the guy who thought he was in a position to physically assault someone in a club that he manages. When I said what he did was illegal, he laughed in my face. Really 'Manager'? Just for your own future reference, battery IS actually illegal. To help you further, I will be more than happy to provide you with the definition of battery under Nevada's Penal Code. NO ONE CAME TO TELL US WE COULDN'T DANCE ON THE TABLE. If we had been told, we wouldn't have done it. \n\nI work in the hospitality industry too and would never treat people the way this 'manager' and the rest of the employees at the night club treated my party. If I were you, I would suggest finding somewhere else to spend your money unless you like being treated like you're below the employees there. I left the club without any resolution. No one could even give me the email address or business card of the supervisor or at least SOMEONE in a higher position than the manager who had no problem laying his hands on a paying patron. Let me end this by saying that I never write reviews, but because I couldn't get an email address to express my thoughts about the poor service at this club, I just had no other option.
