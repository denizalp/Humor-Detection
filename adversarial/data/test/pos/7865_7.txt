I just went to starbucks drive thru (Feb.9.2015 Tuesday 9pm) service was sucks\nI ordered 2 coffees.\nI waited in drive thru lane about 20mins. There was only 2cars front of me. When it my turns, she handed to me one coffee and my coffee was leaking. so she superimposed another plastic cup. My grande cup was sticky all over. Alright. That's fine I have napkins in my car. so it's ok. This could be happen. However, I was expecting she hand to me my second coffee. But she look at me head to toe as forbiddingly. She looked at me like I'm from another planet. So I asked her where's my second coffee? And she says There's no second coffee for you. wth? I ordered by phone and paid already. I showed her receipt whichs I already paid. After that,she don't apologize or says something and just handed to me second coffee with very ugly mad face. Well,bad experience with starbucks. I don't care it was her training,or she was mad at something. Im mad Why she ruin my feelings. And my coffee is still leaking
