Not  enough chairs in gates. They clearly forgot that computers and iPhones exist because theirs 5 plugs for 6 Gates. Read: No plugs to recharge. \n\nThey have recycling bins.\n\nIt looks and feels like I'm walking in a high school hallway and everyone has a rolling backpack. If you're in a rush you'll want to hammer throw at least 2 of these on the walking floor. I wasn't in a rush and I we were tighter than on he airplane. \n\n\n\nNo artwork or color in terminals. Just tan and blue, the colors of corporate America retirement.\n\nI've been here 30 minutes and hate it. People watching is also a fail.
