I had used fresh-land flowers several times and they have delivered on almost all occasions as expected.\n\nUntil this past mothers day (5\/11\/2014) where fresh-land flowers completely missed delivering flowers to my mom in Waterloo. In their defense, they are based in Markham and it is mother's day which is definitely a very busy time of business for them.  However in this business I believe that it is of utmost importance to be timely with special events like a birthday, mother's day, wedding etc. Missing by even one day is a very big deal and has significant social implications. \n\nFresh-land flower was quick to charge me an additional $12 for delivering outside the GTA, and take the money from my account and send a confirmation on the order. But it wasn't until I called my mom on mother's day that I discovered no flowers were delivered. \n\nI tried calling fresh-land flowers immediately but their phones went into an answering machine that was not set up properly (I could not leave a message on the number they provided). In their order confirmation email (from a no-reply email address), they mention to call or send them an email with any questions\/concerns but do not provide an email address to use to contact them. E-mail information is also not provided on their site.\n\nAfter calling them on Monday, the owner was very nice and mentions that they were unable to ship the flowers on Sunday because they were unable to get in touch with the flower shop they use in Waterloo to make the delivery. She had called me on Saturday and left a voice mail saying that she could not deliver on Sunday.\n\nThe issue here is that calling on the day before a delivery, once you have already committed fully knowing the address, the occasion and time of delivery, fully taken the money out of my account and charged me for out of GTA delivery, and with all this, only leaving a voice mail without any further followup to let me 'personally' (as in person to person) know that my mother will not be getting flowers because of your oversight is unacceptable in a business that built on being punctual, and professional.\n\nI would not recommend using them because I do not want to monitor my deliver status and have to be paranoid about delivering flowers to my mother when I have prepared so far in advance already.
