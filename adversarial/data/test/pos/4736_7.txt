Perhaps too kool for me, this place actually has really good food.  An eclectic crowd if twenty somethings and 30-40 year old hipsters, we were brought here by our friends who had recently imbibed in the seafood the previous evening.  \n\nWe started out with a platter of ultra fresh Washington state oyster that were served with a spread of horseradish, and various other sauces.  Next were the dollar each, once again, ultra fresh jumbo shrimp that were peel and eat.  Some in out party were not digging the peel part. \n\nNext, the Brussel sprouts were, for me, the highlight of the night.  Not bitter as sprouts sometimes can be, they were prepared crisp and crunchy.  I wanted more.    The calamari was just ok and I would not order it again, as was the salmon, which was over cooked.  Finally, the lobster cakes were great, with just the right amount of bread crumbs and good sized lobster chunks. \n\nI would definitely come here again.
