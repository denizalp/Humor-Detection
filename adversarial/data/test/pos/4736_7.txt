This place has the absolute worst office manager and staff that I have ever encountered. Every interaction with them is unbelievably disappointing. They won't answer calls from HPN, they won't submit referrals properly, and when you ask to speak to the office manager they send you to voice mail and you never get a call-back. This is not a one time rant. I have been going here for years.\n\nThe only reason I subject myself to this miserable place is because Dr. Korcal is the best doctor I have been to in Vegas.
