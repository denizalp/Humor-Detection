Horrible service! Blah food. I went this past Sunday with a group of friends for restaurant week. I never knew the waitress name until the check came and I read it on the ticket. She was the worst! The restaurant was out of every item I wanted. Scallops, calamari, swordfish, sangria. I ordered a drink and when I was finished the waitress just took the glass away didn't even offer another one. The entire staff just seemed miserable. My friend order the chocolate gelato and found something in it (no wonder why theyhave a 92.5 health score). We didn't  see the manager going around doing table touches like they do in most nice places. We couldn't get out of there fast enough! Don't waste your time or money at this place.
