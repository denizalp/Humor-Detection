Almost a five star bar but I'm a beer snob, but more on that in a bit.\n\nThere is something to be said about a good bar (haha, get it? Goodbar).\n\nThe kind if place where you can toss back some cold ones with people that are fun. The conversationalist. The cute girl who is bubbly and has something interesting to say. Your wingman. And of course, if she's in town, your best friend lady. \n\nThe Rose and Crown is the place where you should hang out with all of them. \n\nI popped in here to get myself a little sauces up before the Yelp Eats UYE, which was next door at Nobuo. \n\nImmediately, the absolutely adorable bartender Kim, came up and promptly took my drink order and made me feel welcome. I'd probably have made more conversation with her but other patrons showed up. Sounds like this is an interesting place.\n\nIt's similar to Nobuo in that it's a historic house and laid out as such. A little musty, but quaint, yet awesome. Very English. You'll see images of Benny Hill and James Bond. \n\nThis place is badass like that.\n\nOk, the beer was slightly piss warm and flat. Something was clearly wrong with the draft line. I know a little something or two about the mechanics of it because fun fact...I've built a draft system before.\n\nI don't mind. I'll stick to hard liquor next time. I loved the vibe so much. This is the perfect place to get hosed.
