As a resident on Plaza-Midwood, this place must be in the top 3 of my favorites.  It gets crowded very quickly, especially on the weekends.  I am a huge BBQ fan and I have made the switch from my previous preference tomato based sauces to now a vinegar based sauce.  I do, however, from time to time get the habanero BBQ sauce which is awesome and has a nice kick!  The brisket is starting to become a favorite of mine but you definitely cannot go wrong with their pulled pork.  I am a sucker for the queso app with a little meat mixed in.  PBR is very cheap and I am all about it at this place.  Parking is scarce but you can definitely find a place across the street and across from the new apartments.  I usually get a sneaky take out when my wife works late but that is all screwed up since she will see this.  Midwood Smokehouse is a must go to spot if you are in the area and want some good BBQ.  Awesome!
