Come here for their Happy Hour Special! I believe it starts from 4-7pm. Everything with alcohol looks so much better! The wait time on a Monday -- was pretty fast. We waited about 5 minutes to board the Ferris wheel. The high roller is the world's largest observation and it's located in Las Vegas! It's located in the rear parking lot of the LINQ Hotel. You won't miss it. Super Huge Spinning Object. \n\nThe happy hour is open bar -- You're stuck with 20 random strangers. At the end of the ride their all your friends! You're packed for sure like sardines, waiting to get drunk! lol It took the Ferris Wheel about 25 minutes to finish a complete circle. The sight seeing is okay.. Nothing major -- I think if they put less people in it.. There is a better chance of walking around and seeing different angles of the strip.
