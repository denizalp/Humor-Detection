The choices for eating here is basically chick-fil-a or rat poison.  Not the best food selection for an airport but also not the worse (thanks chick-fil-a).  Also no lounges?  Wtf.  I want my free booze after work to get my Thirsty Thursday started early.\n\nIn terms of sitdown there is some place called \"Beach Bar\" and another called \"The Pub\".  \n\nSurprisingly getting direct flights to places out of CLE is a pretty big pain in the ass.  This has resulted in some missed connections for myself and my team.  Ugh.
