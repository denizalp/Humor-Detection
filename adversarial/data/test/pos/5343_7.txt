As my good friend & Yelper Paula L. deemed every place we went to @ Vegas \"swanky\" or \"janky,\" the Marquee is definitely swank-ay!\n\nI absolutely enjoyed my night here as we listened to Robbie Riviera spinning, danced, and sipped on drinks next to the beautiful pools and loungey tables outside, and not to mention on the rooftop of the new Cosmopolitan hotel.  There are many bars located at this club, so if one is packed, you can linger around another, inside or outside. I can't emphasize enough how beautiful it was outdoors at night.\n\nThe main dance floor was incredibly packed and it was sort of a hassle to actually step foot, and furthermore dance. That was probably the only con, but on Saturday in Vegas.. uh, what's new?\nThere's a large and mesmerizing LED display background behind the DJ set. And although I didn't really prefer this particular DJ who only played one type of music, I still thoroughly enjoyed the music because the sound quality and atmosphere was great.\n\nWomen's bathroom, no line. Amazing? Yes, kinda. But it was crowded in there. There were long couches and vanities where most girls were just lounging around and (drunkenly) chatting up. COOL\n\nI highly recommend getting on some sort of guest list. We were lucky that someone got a table over here. You can avoid a lot of waiting and paying $$$$ for cover that way. ;) I miss you, Vegas.
