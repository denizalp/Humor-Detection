1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent\n\nFood: 4\nService: 4\nAmbiance: 5\nOverall: 4.5\n\nExtra information:\n\n* Open for dinner and late night\n* Closed for lunch\n* Takes reservation\n* Happy hour\n* Good for large parties\n\nI first found out about Sake Bar Kushi on facebook when my friend 'liked' their page and it showed up on my feed. It was when they just opened and were offering really good deals which I can't remember now cause it's been awhile.\nI've been meaning to check it out but since it was a trip for me to take the subway up to Eglington, it just kind of lingered on my 'go to' list for awhile.\n\nWhen I first walked into Sake Bar Kushi, I was surprised by how spacious the restaurant was. They had communal bar table in the middle of restaurant, individual blocked off tables to both sides and a huge party room at the back! I was impressed.. and then I realized this is Eglington, not downtown. Ok, then that makes a little more sense.\n\nAnyways, it is hard to find a izakaya so spacious that can cater to a large group, so I was pleasantly surprised to see their party room at the back that can hold up to 50 people. Baby shower? Bridal shower? Birthday dinners? good thing to know they don't have a minimum charge for the awesome party room they have.\n\nThroughout the week Sake Bar Kushi always has specials so that is also something to look out for.\n\nOrdered: Spinach Gomaee 4\/5\n\nBlanched spinach with sesame sauce for $4, this seems like it is such a simple salad but so easy to mess up. This was a nice way to start my dinner, the spinach was blanched just right (not too soggy) covered in yummy peanut sauce\n\nOrdered: Avocado Salad 5\/5\n\nFresh sliced avocado with mixed vegetables for $5. Avocado with sriracha is one of my favorite things to eat right now- no wonder I loved this salad. It is just simple and I really liked the light tangy dressing.\n\nOrdered: Ebi Mayo 3\/5\n\nDeep fried prawn served with mustard mayo sauce for $7. This was def different compared to other ebi mayo, the batter was almost like mochi texture (very sticky) and not crispy at all. I thought it was a little weird but my friend liked it nontheless.\n\nOrdered: Cheese Okonomiyaki 4\/5\n\nJapanese pancake with cheese for $7, your ordinary Okonomiyaki but covered in cheese! It was a lot of cheesy goodness and for some reason it didn't even feel too heavy at all. Perfect dish to pair with ice cold beer for sure!\n\nOrdered: Tuna Tataki 5\/5\n\nLightly seared tuna sashimi and green onion, garlic chip with ponzu sauce  for $12. This was my favorite dish out of everything I've tried that night- Tuna was covered in tangy ponzu sauce and that deep fried garlic on top really added flavor to this simple dish, I loved it so much I probably finished most of it.\n\nOrdered: Kimchi Pork Ishiyaki BiBimBab 5\/5\n\nSteamed rice with pan fried kimchi and pork on sizzling stone bowl for $9. I know all of you out there loooooove BiBimBab, but not me! You will never ever find me ordering that at Korean restaurants, but this Japanese-Korean fusion BiBimBab really blew my mind. It has pork belly.. how can it go wrong? It's a nice dish to share and make sure to get some of those crispy bits on the bottom of stone bowl.\n\nOrdered: Kushi Moriawase 4\/5\n\nSkewers with chicken heart, shishamo, pork belly and chicken leg with teriyaki\/spicy\/seasalt sauce for $14. They offer 3 different types of sauce for their kushi (skewers) and spicy was my absolute favorite. Spicy porkbelly and spicy chicken leg would go perfect with beer. Be adventurous when ordering skewers, they offer so many different kinds.\n\nOrdered: Mocha Ice Cake 3\/5\n\nGreen tea cake with icecream, January special for $8. This is only offered in January so it's not something you can find on their regular menu. It was a nice way to end a meal.\n\nSummary: I am so glad I made the trip to check out Sake Bar Kushi cause I absolutely love them. They offer good, quality food and did I mention the service was exceptional? All of the servers were super friendly and even though our table was hidden away in a corner, they were always around when I needed something.\nIt is a little bit of a walk from Eglington Subway station, but I would def be visiting Sake Bar Kushi again. I can't wait to go back and sit down for a nice dinner with some sake! Thanks for an awesome meal :)
