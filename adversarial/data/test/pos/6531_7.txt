Mido Sushi! I can't believe I haven't already written a review about my favorite \"discounted and very affordable\"sushi place. Where else can you go during happy hour (which is pretty much all day until 7 PM) and get a California roll, unlimited edamame, a sesame salad, iced tea AND a delicious bowl of ice cream for under $10?\n\nMy \"bestie\" (hi, Dana) and I like to go for our monthly (sometimes bi-monthly) visit to Mido. We like to sit at the sushi bar and be entertained by \"Pancho\" and his sidekick. He cracks jokes and speaks Spanish (go figure) to us while we PIG OUT on the \"all-you-can-eat\" special with all their freebies. $26 bucks (after tip) and we have to roll our overstuffed selves back to the car.\n\nExcuse me now while I add this to my reviews list of \"Places I like to go with or without friends\".
