Update!  This time we stayed in the one-bedroom suite and it was pretty nice.  Large L-shaped couch with a pull out bed (so could potentially sleep 3 people), big king-sized bed, plus two other armchairs + ottoman that could also sleep 2 people.\n\nNice, large jacuzzi tub in the bedroom.  Full-sized fridge and plenty of dining ware in the kitchen.  I didn't really like the bathroom setup that much and the toilet paper holder broke unfortunately.  Other than that, I liked the accommodations.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend considering the one-bedroom suite at PH Towers if you have a larger group & are on a budget.  Central location + free parking - if you find a reasonable room rate, I'd book it.
