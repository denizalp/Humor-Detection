I feel like I'm supposed to give this show 4 or 5 stars because girls love it, but I found it to be just okay. Not to be a hater, but the guys weren't that hot in my opinion. Nothing super special about the show either - it's pretty much exactly what you'd imagine it to be. Still entertaining at the time I suppose, but not a show I'd bother seeing again.
