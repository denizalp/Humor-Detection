This is a rather average ice cream shop serving pizza and a limited variety of soft serve ice creams.  It is sitting on a gold mine of a location near Frick Park.  Because of this it is often crowded and the service slow.  Nevertheless if you are nearby and craving an ice cream cone, the swirl cone is good.
