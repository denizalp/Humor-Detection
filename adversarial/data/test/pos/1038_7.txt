Ole! My first time at Habanero's and l was pleased!  I ordered a blackened fish burrito, hubby picked the chicken taco. I was offered three salsas, spiced, spicy and green. They were all excellent, the spicy one got my attention. We were quickly served and we loved our quick bite!  \n\nStaff is very friendly and efficient, l definitely recommend it.  They have catering services too.
