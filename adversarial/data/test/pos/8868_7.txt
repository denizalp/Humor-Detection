It must have been good cause we was passed out. My Bae Nikki and I drank too much Chang Beer. \n\nSeriously now.  There are approximately two hundred and fifty five reviews and an unknown number of pics for this amazing restaurant. What else can I add. I have been their twice and do have plans on returning.  Yea there can be some wait times so go across the street to Byblos (I think that is what it is called) and have a couple twenty dollar drinks. They will call you on your cell when your table is ready. I know what else I can add. Pics that my other Bae Mamy took of me and Bae Nikki all hung up on Chang Beer. Peace out Yelpers!
