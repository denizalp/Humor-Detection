In 2017 they tell women to \"cover up\". Decided to give them a second chance and treat my mom to dinner. they kicked  my  boyfriend out for wearing a tank top whilst there was someone at the bar also wearing one.  Very condescending management. The service was very rushed and after the incident they basically shoved the bill on my face. Ruined what could've been a nice dinner with my mom and my boy. My poor Mama was horrified. I WILL NEVER give Houston'a my business again.
