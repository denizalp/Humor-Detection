This place came recommended highly by someone I met at a near-by raw food restaurant, although I'm not sure how or why anyone would recommend this place.\n\nWe showed up to the yoga studio in plenty of time for class to start only to find we were late for a class that was just beginning. They guy at the front desk informed us that the online schedule was either for the previous or following week. ((I don't remember which one??!))\n\nI've never experienced a yoga studio more stinky than this one - and I've been to plenty of hot yoga studios. Why does this place smell so bad???\n\nThe yoga mats this place provided were disgusting -- I'm still in disbelief that I actually used one.\n\nThe studio looks old and outdated -- it did not feel clean at all. I would definitely not walk around barefoot or naked in the locker rooms. \n\nI am not new to yoga, but a friend of mine that was with me was new. The instructor never once came over to help re-position her into the correct stances. Disappointing. \n\nThe instructors looked out of shape - major turn off.\n\nI would never go back to this place. \n\nI'll never forget that stench.
