The Old Town Tavern is in the heart of old town Scottsdale and a perfect stop for any spring\/summer day. I happened to swing by after a San Francisco Giants spring training game and the place was packed full of fans, vacationers and sun soaked locals. Downstairs the band was playing live jams which provided a great atmosphere for a Giant's win against the San Diego Padres and everyone was in a great mood. \n\nThere is a small table upstairs at the bar that overlooks the street and provides an epic birds eye view of the area. We were lucky as the table was open, and our beverages were nice and cold (I had one tequilla & soda with extra lime and it was nice and strong). It's tough to actually critique the place because it's a bit of a dive bar, so ambiance is the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars. \n\nLet's be real here. It's March, I'm in Scottsdale, it's 85 degrees, the Giants just won, and it's raining in San Francisco. Nothing at this point could put me in a bad mood. Just happy.
