If I cooked (or had actually spent the time to master Ms. Sahni's Classic Indian Cooking instead of using it as decoration in my kitchen), this would be close to nirvana, but since I don't cook, this place simply makes me wish I could cook... so I could be close to nirvana. They have an aisle with bags of spices bigger than a baby, and the aisle is wide, clean, and well lit. The entire place is well lit and spacious. This is definitely the largest Indian market in town.\n\nFor those that don't cook, there is a row of boxed Indian meals and a nice freezer selection of items as well. We actually went there to purchase some of the boxed meals to ship to a friend who lives in the middle of Northern California and misses ethnic food. Good call on our part, as they had a nice selection from more than one company. \n\nWhen I was there, they were not serving chaat, but they did have a counter of Indian sweets that were tempting. I resisted.\n\nThe only thing I didn't find was Chandrika Ayurvedic Soap. When I was there, I suddenly wanted to purchase some, but alas, I didn't see any. Leave it to me to be distracted from all the wonderful cooking ingredients to go on a quest for soap.
