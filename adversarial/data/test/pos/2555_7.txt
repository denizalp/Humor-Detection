This newly opened Taco joint that shares their dining area with a Teriyaki Madness is doing it right...\n\nGogo Service: Huge menu board that makes ordering easy and fast.  The service is friendly and you get your food quickly which I appreciate because of my allergy to lines. \n\nMy Go To all stars: The Totchos bowl (#10 on the menu) which is like a tater tots nachos is fantastic.  Very creative and one of my new favorite cheat meal orders. The queso, their in-house sauce and the high quality ingredients really brings this home.  The rolled tacos are tasty. Very filling and amazing value at the price.  Great to eat on the go with their rolled bodies.   Their in-house sauce goes well with everything and is addicting for me like Ranch dressing, Caine's sauce, etc. \n\nAmbiance:  The casual open dining area is shared with the Teriyaki Madness and there's plenty of dining spaces available.  The Flat Screen TV is strategically placed so it can be seen by all dining areas.  I personally like eating the street tacos immediately off the grill versus taking home.\n\nWith the size portions of the orders, quality and freshness of the ingredients, you're definitely coming out ahead with their prices.  Great value.  The Totchos bowl and the rolled tacos are really something you need to try sooner versus later.  They make me find excuses to stop by Gogo's so I can pick some up. =)  I'm looking forward to trying the burritos, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!
