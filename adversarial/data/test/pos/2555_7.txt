Ate here twice post partying. Pizza is terrible. People only like it because they're all drunk. I prefer that noodle place in the Venetian instead for preventative hangovers.\nPizza cheese was runny and parts of the pizza dough wasn't cooked. And it's not all secret. Everyone knows about this place. Lines are long.
