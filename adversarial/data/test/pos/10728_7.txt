I stayed here a couple of time while in the Las Vegas area, and each time I have had a good experience at this location.  This is a low budget place, off the strip and not in a major casino resort (yes, no luxury taxes added to your stay). \n\nThe employees I have had the opportunity to deal with have been nothing but friendly to me and work with me to get everything I needed to make my stay very comfortable.  The rooms are clean, some of the rooms are very large and the kitchen is also clean.  I am sure I can find fault to anything, but my one fault I found was the smell in the hallways, I know it is hard to keep everybody from obeying the rules of no smoking, but you can get around the smell after an few minutes.\n\nA couple of things you should know if you are staying a length of time, you should bring your own towel, soap for the bathroom, and if you like a specific toilet paper of course bring that too.  The pillows are OK, but if you like something more, then you should bring your from home or just add more pillows, otherwise you are good once you go shopping for food and snacks.  \n\nThis is one place I would recommend for anybody in the future to stay at and I am sure I will return here during my travels to Las Vegas.
