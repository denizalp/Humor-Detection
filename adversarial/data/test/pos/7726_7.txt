Not long ago the stretch of Grand Avenue between 7th and 15th Avenues reminded me of the street scenes in \"Escape from New York\" and I honestly expected to find Kurt Russel and Issaac Hayes locked into some sort of badly choreographed brawl down any one of the many dark alleys that I wound my way past. Back in the infancy of First Fridays, in a time when places named \"Paper Heart Gallery\" and \"Emerald Lounge\" still stuck heavily to my tongue the walk from Paper Heart to Trunk Space was a treacherous one. While I could easily ignore and step over the stained winos sleeping openly on the streets, I had to always keep one eye on the tweekers and crackheads that roamed like packs of feral wolves just across the street. Like many longtime suburb dwellers I was scared shitless of the big bad city of Phoenix and rarely journeyed beyond the confines of my east valley enclave.  That all changed one faithful night as I gawked at real live transvestite hookers sipping from brown paper bags in front of Henry Co. Liquor and calling to me suggestively a voice at my side quietly said, \"gentlemen welcome to Bikini Lounge.\"\n\nMoving back to the here and now Grand Avenue between the 7th and 15th Avenues sports a few less roaming packs of drug addicts and a few less homeless people; the biggest change is not being able to throw a rock without hitting some kind of art gallery and the reclamation of the surrounding civilian dwellings that line the area.  While those not familiar with the area, the change in this area compared to my first cognizant adult memories is nothing short of astounding. The pair of venues in this area that helped kindle my current love affair are mere ghosts and only a blasphemous abomination called \"Sidebar\" now merrily resting on the corpse of my beloved Emerald Lounge remains as a marker to remind me of my days of poetry slams and obscure local bands. Which of course is why I feel...nay must share with you the institution that is the Bikini Lounge.\n\nIn the decade since I've been randomly patronizing this stretch of Grand Avenue nothing about the Bikini Lounge's physical self has changed. The infrequently used liquor bottles behind the bar have never been dusted, the bathrooms have never been updated, the booths may have been reupholstered but I assure you the worn down springs are still the exact same I first placed my ass so long ago. The bartenders might have changed but to be honest I wouldn't ever have noticed as I never go to Bikini for a craft cocktail and the bartenders are all the same basic caricatures; you'd never call them pretty and you're not going to comment on their snappy attire but you will order pitcher after pitcher of PBR from them and they will serve it to you with honest efficiency and no frills.\n\nBikini lounge is the epitome of a dive bar; the bathrooms (even when clean) are disgusting and smell of urine, the d√©cor is vaguely matched to the name, there are hand written \"86'd\" notes behind the bar, there's a used pool table off to one side and if the lights weren't always turned down to nearly pitch black darkness you could probably spot nicotine stains on the walls and ceilings from the glory days when you could simultaneously destroy your liver and lungs without ever moving from your bar stool.  To this day I still can't recall if they take plastic cards for payment so I always roll with cash just to make sure. The Bikini Lounge has done what so many other venues on Grand Avenue could never accomplish (besides the afore mentioned Henry Liquor Co); it has survived. And no matter how grossed out I am by the restrooms or how vexed I become at having to carry cash I will always find my way back to Bikini; not because I like the place or because I even really enjoy my time there but because it is now one of the longest standing hipster spots in the hipster scene and, sometimes dear reader, I like to be seen.\n\nMy social anxiety often keeps me from enjoying the DJ's and packed weekend nights and the throngs of good looking twenty-something's often make me want to shriek \"get the fuck off my lawn\" but even after the DJ's stop playing and the suburban hipsters adopt some other dive bar destination to be their scenster mecca, the nostalgia and knowledge that I will always be able to get a pitcher of PBR and that the Bikini Lounge will never, ever change will bring me here time and again...if only for the Snake Plissken memories and the cat calls from the transvestite hookers. I love you Grand Avenue; please don't ever let Bikini Lounge die.
