I honestly hope that no one comes here and purchases from this store. \n\nThey are well stocked on toys and supplies for your dog, cat, rabbit, or bird, and even include little outfits but all of the merch here are priced the same as your local Petsmart or PetCo. Pricing aside, I don't support this little store because of all of the dogs and cats that they have \"for sale\". \n\nI walked in, intrigued at their display on the glass wall and was surprised to see that there was a whole glass casing wall of dogs on display as well. There were Goldendoodles, Huskies, Labs, Bulldogs, Dachshunds, and so many other dogs here that I just wanted to give hugs and kisses to! An employee came out as I was admiring the dogs and I asked, \"Are these dogs up for adoption?\" She responded, nonchalantly, \"No, they're for sale.\" I then asked how much do these dogs cost, just out of curiosity.\" The price range for these dogs BLEW ME AWAY. Starting price for them was $2,000.00!!! One goldendoodle was $2300, another was $2600. One of the dachshunds was $2500. She then told me that they come with bowls, all of their shots, and some other things (I can't remember now). She even added that they had a payment plan for purchasing these dogs as well.\n\nI felt so sorry for the dogs just sitting there, miserable & lonely, waiting for their forever home. \n\nI didn't want to add this because I wasn't 100% certain of what I saw, but I will add it anyway. As I was walking around looking at the toys and costumes for the dogs, my eyes just barely caught a husky hitting the glass wall and I saw a woman's leg retreat from the dog's confined area. It looked and sounded to me like she had kicked him in because he refused to go inside. When I looked up, she made eye contact with me and then moved away. I stayed nearby to see what was going on back there but nothing more happened.\n\nADOPT. DON'T SHOP. This is such a sad & depressing little store. I will not return and will continue to dissuade others from shopping here.
