I need to start a date night blog.  I've decided to put myself back out there, I actually enjoy the courtship process and I'm open to all sorts, so I've been enjoying going out.  Boys, don't get the wrong idea.  LOL.\n \nMy recent visit to Donovan's was delightful, I found the ambiance to be spectacular, it just felt like a nice place.  The wine was good, they gave us great recommendations based on what we were eating, they even asked if we wanted a recommendation  based on price point, which felt odd but was thoughtful.   \n\nThe service was on point, they were very attentive to our needs, nary a dirty plate or empty glass without someone addressing it. \n\nUnfortunately, the steaks didn't deliver like I hoped.  I felt there was little difference between these steaks and what you can get elsewhere. I was expecting the flavor to really pop, but it was a bit bland. Maybe needed a little more salt, black pepper, or marbling.  My date said his steak was the same, and we had two different cuts so this negative aspect was consistent.  \n\nThe average steaks lead to the average score - it is a steak restaurant for heaven's sake.  Not that I paid, but, the price did not seem to correspond with the food experience which we expected, but the date was still successful.
