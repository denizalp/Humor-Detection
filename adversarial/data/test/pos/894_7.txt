We booked our room thru Kayak.com and from the moment we stepped into the lobby- the staff treated us rudely because we didn't book with them directly. Seriously, no one books directly. That's why sites like kayak are in business. \nThe front desk girl told us if there were no complimentary waters in the room, we could come back to the front desk and ask for some. When we did- a different front girl staff argued with us for 7 mins. The conversation went something like this, 'We received no complimentary waters and we were told we could pick some up here.' Employee: 'Well...... if I felt like getting you some, I could. I feel like doing that though'. No lie. Just mind boggling. Not only things like that, but there was no maid service since we 'booked thru a 3rd party'. If you book 'thru a 3rd party' a cleaning service- off site- must be called even if you need a washcloth. Just so you know, they don't show when you call them. So, again, The Signature punishes you for using 2014 technology just by simply booking online. \nIt's a pain to be forced to valet park your car. There is NO self parking, unless you want to park at MGM and walk back to The Signature. FTR- it's a loooooooong walk. So you have to valet park. \nThey do have free WiFi and it was good and fast. So that's a plus. \nWas the place clean? Yep- minus the drunk guy passed out, literally, blocking the door to our room. Again, no lie (pic posted to prove it). He was there all night long. All. Night. Long. No security ever came by to remove him. Matter of fact, we never once saw any type of security here. That's uncomfortable.\nWould we come back? Naw. Much better places where you're treated like a human even if you didn't book directly with them, convenient to amenities, maid service, water and you can self park. \nKinda feel bad if you're one of the condo owners that rents out their condo. I'm not sure what you get for your money there, but it's not a pleasant experience for those who stay at your place. \"\/
