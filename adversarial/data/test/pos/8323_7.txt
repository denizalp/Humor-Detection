I went in with my father who speaks Spanish and me not being able to speak Spanish I really didn't have any concern as I knew what I wanted and most the fruits I want I know in Spanish. The blonde lady there either doesn't know what's on her own damn menu or she doesn't understand Spanish, because I said 3 times what I wanted the kind of fruit I didn't want and which fruit I wanted simple Spanish that I can even manage for someone who doesn't speak it. And they messed my order up even after my dad confirmed it with them. Half their menu is in English either speak English or put your entire menu in Spanish because I assume someone in there knows a little bit of English. \n\nOn the other hand the pupusas are amazing, the crepes are mouth watering and the fruit is fresh and juicy.
