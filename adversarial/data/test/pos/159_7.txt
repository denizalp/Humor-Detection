I really debated on 2 or 3 stars.  Pizza was decent but had close to no sauce.  Their \"Hot Pepper Bites\" are breaded pepper jack cheese cubes.  Albeit, they were good but only when they were hot.  Jalape√±o poppers were a bit too mushy and didn't taste very fresh.  I know what you're thinking; \"boy, that's a lot of different things.\"  Back off!  I had per diem left and needed to use it!  I would maybe give them another chance but I would have t exhaust a few other options first.
