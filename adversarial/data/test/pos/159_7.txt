Amazing place to come to and shop! \nI love that it's an indoor mall and you can walk in the nice cooled place \nThey have lots of stores and eating places \nPrinces are Normal and not crazy expensive \nPlanet Hollywood is also in this mall and you can gamble and shop and eat and drink \nAwesome place to come hangout \nThere's a h&m, guess, Victoria secret and so much more \nThere's also chipotle and Starbucks \nThe parking is still free here thank goodness
