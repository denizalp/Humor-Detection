What Bar Salumi place lacks in square footage, it makes up in spades with killer cocktails, maybe-the-best-I've-tried-in-the-city pizza and an incredible vibe. Located near Queen and Roncesvalles, Bar Salumi is the kid sister of Local Kitchen (which is right next door). It's a wee space that's lousy for groups but perfect for a date; narrow, dim, and buzzing with noise. The kitchen is simply everything you can see behind the bar, a space no wider than a hula hoop. Food is an integral part of the decor: a couple of shiny manual meat slicers are perched on the bartop and massive hunks of cured meat dangle from the ceiling. You can watch the cooks prepare everything (which I did avidly), and it just makes you that much hungrier. \n\nStrong drinks are key while watching food prep. As long as you like negronis, the cocktail list is decent. They have a few variations of the classic cocktail (one with prosecco, another with soda, etc). I opted for a variation swapping out vermouth for a berry-tea-infused Cointreau. Amidst all the flavours, I can't honestly say I could pick out the berry tea, but I liked it. My date choose a simple aperol sour and it was -- as the ladies sometimes say -- uh-mazing.\n\nA tiny space means a tiny menu. There are a smattering of simple appetizers like sardines and crostini, an olive plate, grilled octopus, and other nibbles. We elected to share grilled pears and soft cheese, served on proscuitto and drizzled with pine nuts and honey. I loved this. A great way to get your appetite going. \n\nThere are even fewer pizza options than apps. Of the four, we went with bison with buffalo mozzarella, thyme and lemon. The square pizza is a decent portion, so with an appetizer it was just enough for the two of us[1]. Was the pizza good? HOT DAMN. It was dotted with savoury bison meatballs and served with a fresh lemon wedge on top. The crust was brilliantly thin and so buttery and rich, I should have reached out and high-fived the chef. (I just thanked him instead.) Such a perfect balance of flavours, with not one ingredient overpowering another. I wholeheartedly agree with Ashleigh G when she says that this place could give the other pizza powers in the city a run for their money.\n\nThere is no dessert menu at present, but the chef told me that they might be coming up with something soon. Exciting. If this place is a secret, it won't be for long. Five stars all the way.\n\nObligatory Title Anagram: I MAUL BARS.\n\nMenu Readability: A5-sized paper on a clipboard. Note how prices are shown three different ways.\n\nNeed to mention: The music selection was kick-ass. It might as well have been my mp3 player playing.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I maul bars.\n\n\n\n\n_____\n[1] My date and I were light-eaters that night. Your mileage may vary.
