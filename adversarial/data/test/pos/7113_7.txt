I've shopped at many Nordy Racks in my time, so I will say that this location stand out in the fact that their customer service is pretty on point. I accompanied my husband in so that he can find a dress shirt and some dressy shoes for an outing we were scheduled for Saturday night. We approached the shoe aisle, and this little old lady walks up and asks if we need help. After telling her the style and shoe we're looking for, off she went looking up and down the men's size 10 shelves! She's was quick 'cuz all of a sudden she had 4 shoes for my husband to choose from! Love it! That's what I call service! \n\nWe then proceeded to the men's clothing and, BOOM there was our little personal shoe shopper to help find a button up for the hubby! Lol.\n\nAt this point, she really loved her job or had a mini crush on my gorgeous hubby- lmao, but either way, we were thankful for her exceptional customer service. This store is also the cleanest, most organized Nordstrom Rack, I've shopped at...\n\nFor that, I would definitely consider coming back here for future shopping endeavors.
