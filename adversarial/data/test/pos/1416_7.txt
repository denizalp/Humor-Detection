I've been a student at the college since January and it's been an amazing experience! I did a lot of research before I chose to do my YTT here.  Their program and format were by far the best. \n\nRob and Cathy are wonderful and supportive teachers with great knowledge. Both locations for classes are super nice and central. I will be sad to be done as its been awesome but can't wait to teach!
