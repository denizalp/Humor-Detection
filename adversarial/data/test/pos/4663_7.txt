It pains me extremely to give Amore only 3 stars!!  We have been going to\/ordering from here very often for over a year, even when I was diagnosed with Celiac and had to go gluten-free. I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.  \n\nNow I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!\n\nAs I said before, I hate deducting stars from a place I love so much but if them giving me wheat pasta wasn't bad enough they showed little to no remorse to a VERY FREQUENT customer!!  Not cool!!  Not to mention even if  it didn't work out for me to eat there again and feel comfortable, I have a very hungry boyfriend whose always enjoyed the taste of their foodlll Until the truth of their personalities came out!\n\nUPDATE: This review has gone down to 1 star after being treated in such a POOR manner by the manager\/owner.  He truly lost me as a customer when he said \"I only ordered this stuff for YOU POEOPLE.\"  And continued on stating that he would take if off if he could.  I have never thought the bigotry I would endure in life would be because of an illness which limits what I can eat!  Shame on this place!  I could have become seriously ill from their mistake and his only response was a chuckle saying, \"What, am I supposed to sign off on all Gluten-Free items that leave the kitchen?\"  No Jackhole, you are supposed to educate your staff when you take on the responsibility of serving a very large community of people who are doing this not by choice but for survival!
