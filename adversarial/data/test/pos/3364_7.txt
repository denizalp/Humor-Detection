When I first arrived I was impressed. But, after spending about 20 minutes while a person was evaluating my items that I wanted to pawn I was told that he could do nothing. These were high end fine pieces of art and lladro limited edition pieces. I had appraisals and receipts for all. To tell me I can't get a loan on what was conservatively 20k worth of items is complete bs. OK so you have to discount the appraisals for insurance purposes is fine but to say zero is a complete farce. Are you in the pawn business or not? Complete waste of time. I would not recommend this place. Decide if you are pawn brokers or not then I will change my mind..otherwise stop jerking customers around. The pawn business in this town is predatory and unfair.
