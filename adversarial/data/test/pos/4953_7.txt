We decided to come here on a Saturday for early Father's Day Lunch. Surprisingly, there wasn't a line like at the coffee shop. We were seated quickly and we began to feast. I started off on the \"sushi\" side. There was some spicy tuna rolls, California rolls, unagi nigri and shrimp nigri. None of which was even remotely good. I then decided to try the mac and cheese (yes, I love mac and cheese) and rotisserie chicken at the carving station. This was both good, but some parts of the chicken was dry. I also had some chicken noodle soup and that was full of yummy deliciousness, probably full of MSG but it was good! I was full after that (it was only lunchtime!) and I went on to the dessert. I like that they have an ice cream bar here. However, this time I tried three different mini cupcakes the red velvet, chocolate and vanilla. They were all good, but not great. For the price of $9.99 for lunch and for those of you who have a boarding rewards card, I think its a go!
