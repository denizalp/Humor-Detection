Well tonight I had those Elk sliders. I captialize Elk because I feel they've earned it. Majestic creatures. OK, it was pretty small - but it was perfect. Popped down four in aprx 2 min. Great service. Monday nights is half price wine (!?). OK, Union. I'm buying what you're selling (delicious Elk).
