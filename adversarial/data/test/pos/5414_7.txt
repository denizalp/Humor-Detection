This surely ain't Paris!!\n\nI only had Pain Chocolate here, so I can only rate them based on this. Technically, I would go with two stars, but felt that was unfair because of one item. I went up to 3 stars.  The chocolate part was good, but the rest was a bit dry and lacking in the flavor I'm accustomed to.  The Macarons looked tasty; I might have to give one a try this weekend when I go. \n\nI'll take one for the team and report back!
