If you're central west of the Strip, then a simple yelp search for boba will yield plenty of results.  I mean, hellooo Chinatown -- where half of them will righteously be. It's a pretty saturated boba scene in Vegas and it takes a certain \"je nais sais quoi\" to really stand out from the tea spots that seemingly sprout faster than you can say \"punchcard, please.\"\n\nWith that said, Mr. Tea does try... Many people are probably lured in by their novelty lightbulb cups or split cups, both of which are about $6 extra on top of your drink price. (**EDIT: Oops! Apparently, the $6 includes BOTH drink and cup! This is more reasonable then!**) Foodie instagrammers or wannabes alike will rejoice in the visual candy for sure, but after the first time, I can see how the allure can get lost. Especially with no return incentives for the bulb. \n\nThe two employees working were friendly, welcomed us, and told us to ask questions if needed. The vibe was minimal, clean, and kind of garden-inspired. Located outside of Chinatown, this means you can bypass the parking woes. So those are the positives.\n\nThe COFFEE MATCHA LATTE was my choice while my cousin opted for the STRAWBERRY MATCHA LATTE. We were asked if we wanted to change the sweetness level. We both said no. Even at full sweetness, my coffee matcha latte was on the bitter side. Although I love both green tea and coffee, having them together in one cup was not what I expected. It looked lovely layered, but taste-wise, not so good. Maybe I'll try something different next time.\n\nDon't forget to grab a punchcard. The cashier didn't offer us one, but we got our stamps in after letting her know. Also, 10% with Yelp check-in. Small victories.
