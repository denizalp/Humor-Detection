the burnouts are what makes this place awesome. if you're terrified of anarchists, bums, leftists, scenesters, proletariats, homeless people who want to tell you stories about how they were once the minister of finance, people who think differently, you'll hate it here. go to fucking starbucks, donate a quarter to some NGO that pays their CEO $560 000\/annum, buy a jazz cd, and sit inside thinking about how informed you **feel** you are. while you're at it, why not feel like an individual by cracking open your apple and dropping $10\/hr for wifi so you can surf yelp, what white people like, facebook, browse the lululemon online shop, AND plan your next fucking trip to portland?\n\noh, this place roasts well over 3 dozen varieties of beans which are amazing, and the fresh coffee they serve is cheap but really mediocre. but that's not the point of this place. don't expect a starsucks \"barista\" to ask you how your day is going, expect someone to just make you your damn drink. oh, and the tip-jar isn't near the cash register, you have to throw it into a bin below the menu-board. i can imagine what all the baby-carriage-pushing yuppies are thinking: \"good god, what a dive!\"\n\nas an urban studies major, i cannot stress how vibrant the outside of this place is. the benches outside this establishment are not physically separated\/barricaded from the sidewalk like EVERY single exterior-facing semi-public space in north america. this is great because it allows patrons, those waiting at the adjacent bus stop, and just miscellaneous loitering freeloaders to share a common space. in other words, the operators of this coffee shop are concerned about the public good instead of the constructed interests of their \"customers\". therefore, the scene outside is fun; great people watching and chilling are had, alongside amazing conversations, provided you have an open mind.\n\ni'm no conformist-scene-whore-bohemian type, in fact, i voted conservative in the last federal election. ([EDIT]Dec2011: i really really regret doing that. i was young and extremely stupid in 2009) but damn, i cannot stress how good diverse places like this are to the identity, counter-gentrification, and salvation of beautiful areas like kensington. i'd really say this place is an anarchist cafe, but really, this place doesn't seem like the type that wants to adhere and conform to one group ideology or another. this place is simply something truly urban that you can never find outside of the inner city. it is real.
