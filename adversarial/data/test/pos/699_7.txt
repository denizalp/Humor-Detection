This was a very \"decent\" meal.  My only issue was the next day, there was nothing memorable about going to this restaurant.  There is no dish or plate that you'll be talking about, and the value for the food is minimal at best.\n\nThe service is an A+ here, and you will feel like Giada took the time to put a good presentation together at this restaurant.  It's elegantly modern, from the menus to the decor.  But it's super plain.  She took no risks, and lacked any creativity here.\n\nThe food is very good, but you will have to significantly over order on expensive dishes to leave with a full stomach.  If you're seeing a show after you eat, be sure to splurge on several appetizers, because you will indeed be hungry.\n\nGood: Cheese Antipasti; Lobster Ravioli; Tortellini; Veal Chop\n\nNot So Good: Orzo Meatballs; Porterhouse; Any of the plain, thoughtless side dishes; Emphasis on expensive
