Worked with Josh and Krystina here moving from Dish to DirecTV. Nothing but good things to say about them and their service. I ask endless questions, I received endless answers and was never made to feel as if it was a problem. They really went the extra mile to get my home and RV service set up. I highly recommend dealing with Josh and Krystina for Dish or DirecTV. Put some money into the pockets of the little guys making a living, not directly into the corporate giants!
