(Lyrics - Vitamin C - Smile)\n\nWhen you're hungry for some Thai food and the day is shot\nYou find yourself ordering up the spice you ain't got\nNever goes just the way you want it to \nReview of the day, c'est la vie, that's Yelp life\nIt ain't easy, it's so fun, it ain't easy\n\nPut a Smile on your plate\nMake your palates a better place\nPut a Smile on your plate\n(Whatcha gonna eat, write, whatcha gonna eat)\n\nPut a Smile on your plate\nMake their Yelp page a better place\nPut a Smile on your plate\n(Whatcha gonna eat, write, whatcha gonna eat) \n\n\nSmile! Is what Smile Thai Cuisine made me do!  Plus, drinking a lot of water and sweating along the way.  My family loves their spice and that's where I'll leave it.  \n\nMy family and I started with some papaya salad.  Large in portion and my family again ordered the double spice Thai style.  My tongue was on fire and when they said it was uber spicy; they weren't kidding!  Of course my family was fine except I ate it sparingly.  \n\nI myself ordered their Pad Gra Pow, stir fried ground meat with basil leaves, bell peppers, green beans, bamboo.  I was a bit perplexed at first since I expected the beef to be ground beef, but it was in chunks; which wasn't a bad idea.  Needless to say, the dish was phenomenal!  I ordered only the 4 out of 5 spice and it was just enough for me.  The meat was well seasoned while the pellets of green beans; to my surprise again worked well with the dish.  It was all in a scramble, but I realize cutting the green beans in these bits helped eating the dish more enjoyable.  The bamboo shoots and bell peppers provide a much welcomed crunch and texture and the rice on the side was mellowing ingredient to jell the entire entree!\n\nMoreover, my family shared with each other's dish.  The only other dish I would love to advertise is the Kai Soi; which I plan to order next time, was a thick curry broth of coconut milk along with minced pork, tofu, and shrimp.  Served with bean sprouts, onions, and peanut and topped with stir fried crispy noodles.  Overall, a beautifully plated dish and the thick broth with the soft and crunch noodle combo was well received to the palates.\n\nIn the end, smiling was something you couldn't resist after a good meal with family.  Smile Thai Cuisine is a little hidden gem that deserves some love. - Enjoy!
