The place is a sit down kind of restaurant . The menu is not very helpful and the food selection is limited. I am used to Filipino food places like Fiesta Filipina where you can come in and pick any food you want quickly because it's ready. I was disappointed to see that it was a sit down place. There is also a distinct smell to the place. I don't want to say it smells bad but it was noticeably present.
