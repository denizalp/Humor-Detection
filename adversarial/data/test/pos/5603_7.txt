I only stumbled in here because there was a sign that said they were selling Deep-Fried Twinkies for 99 cents. Even though I pride myself on eating well and working out, I cheat like a sonofabitch. \n\nThe casino itself is slightly more ghetto than its brethren on Fremont St. I think they know people are only lured in by their food specials. This was pretty much confirmed when I noticed the line for food practically had more people in it than the casino, and it was a short line. \n\nThe braided black lady who took my order was a total bitch. I cackled when her coworker shouted out a reminder for everyone in line to \"make sure we don't forget to be tippin'\". I'll be sure to take that into consideration, thanks. \n\nThe deep-fried Twinkie tasted like a bigger Twinkie. All they're really doing is adding more breading and fat to it. It's one of those novelty items you'd eat at a white trash country fair just to say you'd done so. I can't imagine anyone legitimately likes to eat them this way. I also got a 99 cent All-American Hot Dog, which somehow managed to taste like total crap. \n\nI'd suggest stopping in for something quick and unhealthy if you're drunk enough. Stick with the novelty fare, like Twinkies and Oreos, and skip anything else they're trying to pass off as actual food.
