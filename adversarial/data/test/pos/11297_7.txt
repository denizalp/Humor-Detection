Wow.  It's 9:30 on a Monday evening and I am fighting the urge to just completely zone out and fall asleep.  Why might I be so tired?  I just got back from a ridiculous weekend in Vegas.  Yet, despite my exhaustion, I feel compelled to start my reviews.  So over the next few reviews, you will see a sort of travel journal.  Hope that this review turns out to be coherent.\n\nHaving arrived in Vegas on Saturday afternoon, my friends and I decided that the first course of action should be to grab some dinner.  My dear friend and facilitator, Monica D., suggested that we hit up this seafood buffet.  Being an avid fan of both seafood and eating way too much, I was more than happy to try this place out.  \n\nFirst off, let me say that in most instances, I've been pretty disappointed with Vegas buffets.  The last buffet I went to was the Spice Market and I didn't even bother writing a review about that place.  Well, this certainly isn't the case with Studio B Buffet at the M Casino and Resort.  The food here was surprisingly good.  In most instances, the food was at least on par with standard restaurant fair.  Granted there are a few things that seem more buffet fair, that was definitely more of an exception than the norm.  \n\nA few highlights from this buffet:\n\nOysters:  I love oysters.  While I had my fair share here at this buffet, little did I know that this would be a reoccurring theme throughout the weekend (you'll see what I mean later).  I'm pretty sure I've done my part in attempting to commit genocide against these delicious little mollusks. \n\nCrab legs:  Delicious.  Dipped in butter these crab legs were sweet and flavorful.  It also didn't hurt to watch my friend Craig struggle to get these things open only to end up having one explode all over the place.  Let's just say that he probably was wearing more of it than he actually ate.\n\nClam chowder:  Seriously, this chowder was a CHOWDA (say it Frenchy!  It's chowda!).  Thick, rich, and packed with flavor, I would be happy eating this chowder at any restaurant.  \n\nDessert bar:  Banana crepes? Yes please.  I love banana crepes and these were fantastic.  Almost a bananas foster atop a delicious crepe, I devoured mine and would have gone back for another if there were even an iota of space in my already food pregnant stomach.  They also have a bunch of other desserts, all of which were pretty damn good.\n\nBeer and wine bar\/Espresso bar:  What?!?  You mean to tell me that beer and wine are included with my meal?  Yes, yes it does.  And to put things over the top they also have an espresso bar.  You can add shots of Amaretto, Bailey's, and some other things to your shot of espresso if you feel so inclined.  I know I did.  Two espresso shots with Bailey's for me please.  Ain't nothing better than mixing a stimulant and a depressant together to get your evening started right.\n\nAnyway, by this point you probably get the point.  This buffet, while out of the way from the strip is well worth the trip.  I'll definitely be coming back.  Also, another perk -  there are a lot of really cute Asian girls here.  Go figure, little Asian girls and seafood?  Who would have thunk it?
