Let me just start by saying if you are a fan of sushi\/sashimi Nobu is an absolute no go. We ordered the Premium Sashimi Dinner, 2x Uni, Miso Soup, Edamame, Yellowtail Sashimi w\/ Jalapeno, Pork Belly Skewers, Rock Shrimp Tempura and Vegetable Tempura. ALL OF IT WAS UNDERWHELMING. \n\nThey brought out the Miso Soup that was lukewarm and tasted like it came from a packet. The Edamame tasted like it was previously frozen. The Yellowtail Sashimi did not taste fresh, it had more of a ceviche texture. The Uni did not taste fresh, in fact it was extremely bland. The Premium Sashimi Dinner came with 3 pieces of otoro that was cut into blocks and throughout the entire piece had a membrane intact that was near impossible to chew through. Rock Shrimp Tempura literally is fried shrimp doused in a mayonnaise textured sauce. The Vegetable Tempura was some of the worst I've had. The only thing that had decent flavor was the Pork Belly Skewers but at $15 for 2 of them, I've had MUCH BETTER. \n\nOur server seemed really pushy in trying to sell the A5 KOBE that they charge $38\/oz and you have to get a minimum of 6oz at a total price of $228. When I seemed disinterested in ordering that he seemed more disinterested in waiting on our table. Needless to say I'll never be going back to this overly trendy extremely overpriced excuse for a Japanese restaurant.
