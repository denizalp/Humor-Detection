Just. Awesome.  19th Avenue Farmers Market is freaking awesome.  It is the first time I see what a real farm-to-table market is like.  \n\nLocally grown and picked produce can be bought by the bucket at the outdoor market.  Home cooking chefs can buy retail-sized at the indoor market.  Selection vary by season, On my visit, I counted that there were cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, celery, leeks, onions, beets, corns, zucchini, and many other produces.  There were various varieties of tomatoes, eggplants, chills, cucumbers, peas, herbs, peppers, etc..  Some I have never seen before (I got excited over a Sicilian eggplant that looked like a giant purple tomato).  Of course, there were many fruits.  Please look at the pictures to see the selections yourself.  There was also a fridge that stored fresh eggs.  There was a small section of pastries.  And oh mine, everything was so fresh.  The spinach and onions I bought were so fresh that I could smell it.\n\nIf you are going make a batch of pasta sauce, salsa or pickled cucumbers, I don't see why you can't buy half a bucket or even a bucket for cheap here.  19th Avenue Farmers Market also runs a Pick-Your-Own Strawberries field in summer.  Opening day varies.  Please check the website for opening days and hours as well as appropriate containers to bring with you.\n\n19th Ave Farmers Market opens to public from June to November, 7 days a week.  It is conveniently located near Woodbine Avenue and 19th Avenue.  Parking is free.\n\n19th Ave Farmers Market is owned and run by the Top Tomato Foods.  It has a stall at the Ontario Food Terminal since 1960.
