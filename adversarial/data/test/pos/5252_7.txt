People love my fast food reviews, so here is another at a fairly new establishment in the far reaches of the valley. I'm not sure that at $3.19 for a single burger, we can call it fast food, but it has a drive through, so it qualifies. My only purchase was the single steakburger on what seemed to be a very buttered bun. The patty was thinner than a wafer and was hand formed and a tad on the greasy side and not really comparable to any other fast food burger. It falls below In and Out, when they are having a good day and basically in its own category. Nothing wrong with this place on occasion and the burger is dressed with a few slices of onion and sliced pickles.\n\nUPDATE: Grilled Chicken Sandwich belongs in nastyville. Avoid at all costs.
