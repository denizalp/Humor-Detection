Carb-loading GOLD! We found this on Yelp as were were driving through Vegas towards Arizona\/Utah. Italian-Japanese fusion is a totally new concept to me, but the execution was perfect. \n\nOn a Saturday night we surprisingly had no wait for a table. It was so hard to choose from the menu because everything sounded so delicious and I wanted to try all the dishes.\n\nFor starters we had the octopus carpaccio and soft shell crab. I've primarily known carpaccio in beef or tuna, so octopus was a nice twist. It was sliced thin enough that I didn't notice a chewy texture which is pretty standard with octopus and the wasabi mayo complimented it nicely. The soft shell crab was a success for both me and my husband. The portioning was a little small and left me wanting more. The balsamic dressing that was left behind was perfect for dipping bread into. \n\nOur main dishes were the miso carbonara and fettuccini Salmon & \"Ikura\" pastas. The fettuccini was our second favorite, but for some reason that night I was really craving fettuccini. The noodles were swimming in a rich white cream sauce, mixed with pan-fried salmon pieces, and topped with salmon roe. It was a dish that was put together well, but I definitely would want to try other things on the menu before coming back to this one. The miso carbonara, though, was prize-worthy. The miso sauce just added the right touch of Asian flavors to the dish.\n\nThe prix fixe dinner allows you to choose an appetizer, entree, and drink for a reasonable price, which is what both my husband and I chose to do. I can't wait to return and eat my way through more of their menu!
