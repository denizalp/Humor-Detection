Been getting my lashes done else where for awhile.  Always wanted to try this place and finally got the chance.  Feel really bad because the girl was so nice. Do NOT use the apprentices!!!!  Obviously they are not trained very well.  Cherry says they just need to get their time down. True, but more than that, they need to be trained!  I wasn't too worried about the time b\/c I like to take a nap, but I expect to wake up with beautiful lashes.  I can literally count the amount of lashes she put on each eye.  Although my lashes are naturally super short, I have a TON of them and I'm definitely used to them being A LOT fuller.  I'm kind of wondering what the hell she did for 3+hours.  Lunch?! The salon is def. nice and relaxing but whoever is training these girls might want to double check their work before putting them out on the floor and charging customers.  You couldn't have paid ME to have the sloppy work that was recently done on me.  Now I know, you get what you pay for.  So disappointing.  Unfortunately I won't be back.
