I was browsing the internet  one day and came across a list of the \"Best Pizza in Every State\".  The pizza for the state of Arizona was \"The Salsiccia\" from The Parlor.  That is a bold claim and I knew I had to try it out!  I placed my order over the phone and headed on down to pick it up.  I parked in the visitors parking spot, went in, paid my money and was out the door.  I drove for a little while before pulling over to sample a slice.  Here is how it was........\n\nThe Salsiccia ($17.50)-  This pizza is described as \"Schreiner's Parlor Blend Sausage, Grilled Radicchio, Sage and Saba.  I had no idea what saba was so I had to look it up.  Turns out that it is a syrup made from grape juice...a type of balsamic vinaigrette for the most part.  I was excited to try it out!  I grabbed the first slice and noticed the yellow\/white colored cheese.  They use cheddar and mozzarella for their cheese blend. It was just alright.  I would have preferred a little more cheese and to have it straight up mozzarella.  It was still decent though.   This pizza was loaded with sausage!  Schreiner's sausage is some of, if not the best in Phoenix and tons of restaurants use it.  It is really delicious!  The saba gave it a nice little sweetness.  The grilled radicchio worked well, too. Sounds like a pretty good pizza so far, right?  Yeah...kind of.  These great toppings were loaded on top of an incredibly bland crust.  The crust had no flavor whatsoever. I was totally disappointed!  The crust is my favorite part, and this crust was whack!   I do have to give the pizza maker props though.  This thing was layered perfectly with the ingredients.  It was so well put together that I ate the rest of my slices going 75mph down the 10 Freeway.  Not one piece of anything fell off my slices!  I was impressed!  Was this the best pizza in Arizona?  Nope!  Were the toppings and flavor good (minus the crust)?  Yep.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I tried this out but I don't think I will be hurrying back.  For $17.50, I will go buy a pizza at other spots.  They do have a Happy Hour here though which discounts smaller pizzas between 3-6 pm every day.  I may come back to sample some of their other varieties.  If the crust isn't better on future visits though, I can't see myself becoming a regular.
