Guys y'all can go through my Yelp account and look through it. I don't give bad reviews, I rather promote businesses and help my city grow. Being a business owner myself I take my feed back into consideration if there is a negative one.  But this place. Jesus Christ himself could change water into wine but can he change shit into a gourmet meal? Probably not. \nAsian in fused food, viet food. My cultures food. THIS PLACE IS AN INSULT TO VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, FOOD AND THE COUNTRY ITSELF! it's that fucking bad. They must of used the unwashed ass hole of a pig to make their pork banh mi, I don't know what they are thinking or how could they possibly fuck up the taste of simple Vietnamese cooking.  \n\nAnd the prices wow seriously, ok I'll be considerate and understand that rent for that area is probably way higher than other locations and the place looks nice. But u are selling a menu not the view. \n\nNo it's not one bad experience so it's not from just a bad day, it's being dragged out with friends that also wanted to try it. Their comments and opinions are the same as mine but since I payed I'll comment on it. \n\nThe American people that eaten here and liked it. It's ok it's not your fault u don't know what things are suppose to taste like.
