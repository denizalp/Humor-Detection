Went to the drive thru and was surprised that there was someone there taking orders.  That was totally new to me since In-n-Out does that. Never seen it at McDonald's.  He was friendly and took our order fast and correct. The drive thru lady was friendly.  \n\nThis location has a playground for kids.
