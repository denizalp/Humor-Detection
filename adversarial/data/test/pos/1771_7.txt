So.... as I write this I am literally outside of the shop. It is 1055a. Doors are not open and its a cool, brisk 105+ degrees outside... in the shade. I'm put into weird place to be in when you are sweating your butt off outside waiting for a good haircut and the barber hasnt shown up yet. You call to the second location and they cant help you either.  Well im sure they can if you drive down the street and see their present and availabe barbers.  But to locate your barber for this location,  no help. Funny thing is the other patrons that are out here with me sweating and frustrated tell me that this happens often. So in my head im thinking. Wait and hope for the barber to show up, if he shows up. Then wait again inside of this unique and awesomely decorated place. Try to cool off. Sit in the chair for a good hair cut. Pay and leave. Or just leave. Not come back. And find a new barber were they typically will show up on time. Wait for a hair cut and leave not sweating and suffering outside waiting for heat stroke. Hello car and ac. Finished typing this at 1100. And doors still not opened. That is 1 hour and ticking.
