Adjacent to LGO Grocery, this pizzeria is a poppin' spot in Phoenix! Order at the counter and snag a table, then people-watch as your pie gets made. There's beer and wine available, and gelato next door for dessert.\n\nOpted for the unusual with the Avocado Pizza, added proscuitto- a great brunch pizza and big enough to share! The crust was tasty and the toppings were generous. In a city with a surprisingly high number of noteworthy pizzerias, LGOP has inventive options at more affordable prices, with less wait and better ambiance.
