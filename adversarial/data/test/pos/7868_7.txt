Simply put, I am neither pierced, tattooed, nor hip enough to frequent this Common Market on a regular basis. Sure, I'll run in and out real fast to pick up some beers or lunch to go, with my head hung low so as not to attract attention. But, I never linger because I just can't handle the crowd that does hang out here. #iamold \n\nIf you are slightly uncool and don't have a hip bone in your body like yours truly, might I suggest you check out the new Common Market Oakwold. Now, there is a place that I can (and do) hang out at multiple times per week!
