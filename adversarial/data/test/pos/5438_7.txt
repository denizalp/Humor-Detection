You WILL get laid!  You WILL have an awesome meal!  You WILL be comatose.  It WILL NOT be cheap :)  I have not had a meal where EVERY SINGLE DISH was AWESOME!!!\n\nMy buddy and I visited Las Vegas recently and had a craving for steaks after golfing.  He is from NYC, so when I pulled up the Yelp reviews, he immediately chose Craftsteak.   \n\nI honestly did not know too much about the place except that it was expensive and got a number of great reviews.  I quickly called to make a reservation and that was easy-breezy. \n\nThe staff there was good looking.  Hot asian hostess sat us down and our waitress was a MILF (All names have been erased for confidentiality)\n\nThe meal was superb.  We chose the $155 per person domestic wagu beef.  The meal was so filling, YOU DO NOT NEED TO ORDER ADDITIONAL SIDES.\n\nHere is my summary of each dish:  \n1.  The salted bread.  So super soft, buttery and salty.  Melted in my mouth... I had three of these babies.\n2.  The romaine salad.  Crisp and the croutons were the best I had.  simple but delicious\n3.  Beef tartare.  Delicious, but we did not finish.  the crostini were perfect.  Just crispy enough.\n4.  Mushrooms.  Delicious.  Finished that.\n5.  Brussel Sprouts.  Good.  Not the best I have ever had, but damn delicious\n6.  Potato puree.  Very good.  did not finish\n7.  Filet Mignon.  This was my favorite.  Yum-yum.  \n8.  Skirt Steak.  Also delicious, but I liked the Filet mignon better\n9.  Buffalo mozzerella.  Also good.  The mozzerella was super soft.  I presume it is cause it was made there.\n10.  Lobster Bisque.  This was gone in 60 seconds.\n\nI am an average eater.  I could barely eat the dessert.  \n\nWe ordered the Yamazaki 12 $15 per glass and the Midleton Very Rare $30 per glass.  Total tab with a $65 tip was a tad over $500.  It was for one of my good buddies that I went to highschool and college with.  \n\nThis is definitely a place to bring somebody special to you or a hot date.  \n\nI wish I could have said that I won at the casino and that it was, 'Compliments of the MGM'  But maybe next time. \n\nOh, do not worry too much about dress code.  I was wearing my golf attire and my Steelers hat.  As long as you can foot the bill, I think they do not care :)
