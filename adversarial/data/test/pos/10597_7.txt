Visited la Mexicana the night of March 27 @ around 6:30pm. The place was fairly busy and although we did not have reservations, we were seated without having to wait. We were a group of 3 and the restaurant was the suggestion of one of my dining companions, who has been here several times, and recommended it as she \"loves\" the place and it's in walking distance of her condo.\n\nMyself and my partner were not so equally impressed.\n\nThe food is not authentic Mexican fare, but more along the lines of Tex-Mex...which is not a bad thing if you go in expecting to get Tex-Mex food. I had hoped a place called La Mexicana would be a bit more authentic, but hey...to each their own.\n\nThey start you with some tortillas and salsa (a creamy version, not a chunky kind that most people are used to). They were fresh and tasty.\n\nOne person ordered a pre fixed meal...soup, entree and dessert. It was reasonably priced at $20. The waiter came back about 5 minutes after taking her order to let her know that they were out of what she ordered, but he did offer her other more expensive options and would still charge her the pre fixed meal. Nice recovery but still....\n\nSoup was Potato\/Cauliflower, entree was a Tamalita (sp), I had no idea what the dessert was...looked like a creamy rice pudding. She liked it, which I suppose is the most important thing, as it was her meal.\n\nTwo of us each ordered the Sample Platter....it was $16 and contained: salad; black re-fried beans in a tortilla shell; enchilada (covered with a slightly spicy red sauce); shredded beef burrito (very, very, very, bland); and a cheese quesadela (sp).  It was good, not great. Everything was fairly bland other than the chicken enchilada.\n\nDecor is ok....however our table was uneven and \"rocked\" whenever it was touched. Drove us crazy as we're \"elbow resters\"...\n\nWhile I wasn't that thrilled with the place, I will give it another try and will enquire if the heat factor can be taken up a notch.
