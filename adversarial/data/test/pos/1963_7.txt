Renter beware!  \nThe rent is artificially low due to the sneaky fact they have hidden charges.\nSewer water trash can add up to $100 extra monthly to rent.  \nThey do not mention this when signing a lease agreement.\nThe maintenance do a good job and the office staff is friendly.  \nThe property is older than others similarly priced in the area.\nAlso important to note that it borders a low income apartment complex called wild horse.   \nA plus is it is next to a golf course and walking distance to starshmucks overpriced coffee.
