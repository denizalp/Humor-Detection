I watch Candice Nelson on Cupcake Wars all the time and knowing she opened the \"world's first cupcake bakery\" I had to check this place out once it opened at the Linq. \n\nNever having Sprinkles before, I did come in with high expectations due to all the hype. Bought the cuban coffee, black&white, red velvet, and coconut cupcakes. I really wanted to love them but they were just okay, in my opinion. Out of the 4, the cuban coffee was the one that stood out the most but the others faded in the background. I'd honestly prefer to go to nothing bundt cakes.\n\nIf anything, their ice cream caught the attention of my taste buds. Capn' crunch and red velvet are must try's. The red velvet cone was too sweet for my liking although visually appealing for photos.\n\nI will say that staff here is top notch. I don't know if they're high on sugar, but everyone here is extremely friendly, peppy, and approachable. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way, but if in the area, it's a place to stop by and check out.
