Only gave it 2 stars because they charged me an extra $15 for being out of towner.  I liked the people there and enjoyed the swinging , but the out of town charge was not right.  I have been to several swing clubs and never seen anyone charged extra.  There are other clubs in Vegas that don't have this discriminary practice
