Market Street Kitchen wins in ambiance but gets a B- in price. I find that the menu items are very expensive for what they are and because of that, we typically opt for other restaurants in the area. However, the patio earns this restaurant at least a three star rating. When the weather is nice, it's enjoyable to sit outside and have some food and drinks. However, I suggest doing so during happy hour otherwise you might find yourself spending a pretty penny on an appetizer, burger and drink.
