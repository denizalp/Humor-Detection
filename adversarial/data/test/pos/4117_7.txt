Meating is a family run, independent butcher (and more) in Leslieville. Whereas I am not a huge meat eater, I can definitely appreciate the quality of the offerings, and the reasonable prices.\n\nAll meat at meeting is grass fed and sourced from a Ontario Farm. Free range chicken and Ontario Lamb also available.  \n\nA Gigantic filet of Wild Salmon, marinated in garlic and herbs is about $20.00, suitable for at least two generous portions and unbelievably tasty. Sausages are about $4.99 a lb and approximately 1\/2lb each. Blueberries, Strawberries, Herbs all make an appearance in the flavor combinations. The most popular choice is Ecuadorian. All Hand made without additives.  \n\nSummer fresh salads and cheeses in the prepared foods area, as well as cooked meats and Dufflet pastries. A Wide variety of Latin American food stuffs. \n\nBeautiful produce, all very fresh and well prices (beets $1 a lb, lemons $.50 each)\n\nYet another reason to love Leslieville.
