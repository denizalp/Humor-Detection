I think my boyfriend almost fainted when I told him I'd never had Jamba Juice. I've just never been the kind of person to seek out smoothies and juices when I can easily make them at home. \n\nBut when you're hungover at the McCarran airport, this is a must. \n\nOverall my smoothie was delicious, but that's not really hard to make happen when you blend tasty fruit together. What really surprised me were all the options to get what you really wanted. Need veggies mixed in? Protein and other vitamin powders? Maybe you're on a yogurt kick? All available. Or for those weirdos like me, who just want straight-up fruit, no added sugars or things, they have that too! \n\nI also appreciated the swiftness of the staff and their organization. The customers on the other hand... they're a different story. Just make sure you head up to the counter to place your order BEFORE you end up standing behind those who are just waiting for their smoothies and juices to be prepared. A little situational awareness goes a long ass way. \n\nI also wasn't too pleased with the pricing on these things--holy hell were they expensive for something you pee out within minutes. But I suppose that's what you get for buying blended fruit at a popular airport. \n\nThose four stars are for all those positives I mentioned above, and for the fact that my giant, expensive smoothie DID cure my hangover, which was a huge plus.
