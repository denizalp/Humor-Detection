A Different Twist.\n\nThe food at Mokis  Grill is good, the restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating. On this visit I had the sweet and sour chicken plate and my dinner companion had the katsu and teriyaki chicken. The combo plates come with white rice and macaroni salad and I have to admit I am not a fan of macaroni salad but the macaroni salad at Mokis Grill     is really good.\n\nThe portions are a good size and great if you dont want to have a heavier meal. Definitely not bad for a fast food.
