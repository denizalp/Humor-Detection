The laziness of the staff at this store worked to my advantage recently. I went in looking for a humidifier & found one on sale. When the cashier rung it up, the regular price was showing so I told her that the sign on the bin said it was still on sale.  Turns out the sale was over but the sign was never taken down. So I got it at the sale price!
