Excellent food made by wonderfully nice people, this is a family run sub shop at its best!\n\nI came by here on a recommendation by my mom. It's not like my mom's recommendations are always solid, but since visiting this restaurant she seems to have made it her personal mission to tell everyone about it, and now that is something! When she told me she's even taken to handing out the store's flyers (maybe one day she'll discover Yelp... far more effective...) I knew I had to at least check it out!\n\nI asked the owner for a recommendation - \"Get anything,\" she enthusiastically urged, \"it's all good!\" It was by no means a cocky statement, she just seemed very eager that I try her food, because she knew I would like it.\n\nI went with a Chicken Satay Sub, and she was completely right - It was wonderful! Good chunks of fresh tasting chicken with a delicious sauce. I told her I wasn't too afraid to turn up the spice and she gave me a sandwich with a tasty amount of heat.\n\nWith subs, there's not much to go on, so pretty much every single ingredient needs to stand on it's own and at The Submarine it really does!\n\nA crispy length of cucumber, tasty carrots and bright, fragrant cilantro that looked freshly snipped topped off my sub. And then the most important part - the baguette. I commented to her about how tasty the baguette was and she told me they get them from a small, local bakery. \"I buy from them every day,\" she told me. \"They're just small, so they need us just like we need them.\" But the big reason she chooses their baguettes is because \"they're crunchy on the outside but also soft, so they don't cut the roof of your mouth!\" She's got a really great point! This baguette walked that perfect balance between crunch and squishy freshness.\n\nIt's a filling sandwich, so much thatI had to save half as a snack for later. At $9.50, they're not the cheapest Banh Mi in my mom's words that I'm sure she will now pass on to you - \"She doesn't want her business to be the cheapest. She wants to be the best.\" And I think they do one fine job at it.\n\nBottom line - Delicious home cooked Vietnamese-style submarines from a family you feel good about giving your money to.
