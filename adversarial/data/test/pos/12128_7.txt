so i was scrolling through yelp looking for food as always and i came across A Donut Burger. I also realized that it was only about a 7 minute walk from my hotel (The Linq) so i went off on my mission to try the donut burger !\nMost of the Restaurants in Vegas are inside of hotels so they are hard to find. while GpS might be helpful it won't tell you much when it comes to maneuvering inside and out side hotels. It's inside of the Venetian. \nI get there and it wasn't crowded at all, so i sat at the bar. i already knew what i wanted but i still took a peak at the menu. i immediately ordered the donut burger (with out the egg on top) and began my wait. \nIT ARRIVED!! it was so pretty and juicy looking. i took my pictures and cut it. IT WAS HUGE !! I took my first bite & WOOOOW. it was one of the best burgers i ever had to be honest with you!! the way the bacon went perfectly with the donut! OH EM GE ! deff a Vegas must have. it came with french fries which were cool. but nothing special compared to the burger i was eating. i would deff go back and get that burger again. i literally have no complaints. the bartender was sweet and personable, the food was great and my burger was cooked at a perfect temperature & it seemed clean.
