So \"Hyatt Place\" is the Hyatt's value-based business hotel chain, which basically means you won't be thinking you entered a Starwood resort when you check in. No, this is what my manager would call a \"reasonably priced hotel\", a smart choice for those who need to stay overnight in this part of Phoenix with no expectation of having a luxurious spa sanctuary awaiting you after a day at the office. Nope, but you can expect a pair of queen beds (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2mNsTBF) and a separate sofa sitting area (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2reRvrO) like you would expect in any mini-suite. I got lucky and secured a room for less than $100 a night, and it overlooked the parking lot.\n\nThe alternative on the other side is the constant, nerve-rattling hum of traffic on the Black Canyon Freeway. The breakfast bar is quite expansive (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2Dill4p), although the seating is curtailed by how small the lobby is. Since I mostly eat fruit, plain yogurt and cottage cheese these days (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2DoZRSm), I'm not as picky about how much elbow room I need. My waffle iron flipping days may be over. I have to say though that the front desk was quite attentive to all the details of my accommodation, and I appreciate how much they wanted feedback to their service (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2mN1kZa). A proactive mindset goes a long way with a no-frills business traveler like me.
