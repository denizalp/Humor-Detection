We got tickets from my cousin and loved the show. It was so much fun! It was truly like magic mike but in real life. I enjoyed how they don't make the venue absolutely huge so it makes it quite intimate. I would definitely go back for a bachelorette or birthday party. \n\nDrinks are a little spendy, but you get a nice souvenir cup with a picture of one of the sexy men. \n\nBring your girls and prepare to have no voice at the end.
