CM and I visited South Park on Sat. to take advantage of the beautiful spring weather.  Given our (mis)adventure at Raccoon Creek State Park last weekend, visiting a county park with paved trails that wasn't too terribly far from the city sounded like a great idea.\n\nWe parked near the traffic circle in the center and picked up the Buffalo Ridge Trail, an unpaved trail that winds around the park, across the circle next to the Girl Scout Lodge.  This trail was a bit muddy near the creek, but not nearly as bad as the trails at Raccoon Creek, and it promptly dried out as we followed it uphill.  Generally, the trail was easy to follow, with some minor ups and downs, except for at the U-shaped parking lot, which it cuts across.  Eventually, we found the trail's outlet from the lot and continued on our way, circling around and ending up back on the main path on Corrigan. For the second part of our walk, we continued on the main path along Corrigan until we reached the paved loop path.  Needless to say, this part of the walk was easy going, since it was completely paved and basically flat.  Additionally, it allowed us to see the Maple Springs area with the gazebo, which was quite picturesque.\n\nGiven that South Park is located in the South Hills suburbs of PGH, and that the weather was gorgeous, there were many people out and about during our visit.  Most of the people we saw were accompanied by either young children or dogs.  I was honestly surprised that, given the amount of area we covered in the park, we didn't encounter any bathhouses (though I did see plenty of porta potties).  I'm not going to lie--I was also disappointed that we didn't come upon the buffalo, esp. when I heard that they recently calved.  :-(\n\nOverall, CM and I had a pleasant time in South Park, and would definitely be willing to return--esp. to see the buffalo!  While South Park isn't quite as large as North Park and doesn't have a lake and kayaks, there's still plenty to see and do there.  So, if the weather's pleasant, and you're looking for a nice change of scenery, check it out!
