How do you screw up Mexican food? The parking lot at this place is always full, so we thought, why not try it? has to be good. wrong, so wrong. When we were seated they brought tortilla chips, salsa, and some sort of ranch dip to the table. RANCH? This isn't applebee's. It's supposed to be Mexican. Strike one. The chips weren't warm and freshly made as I am used to. Strike two. Tasted the salsa, which looked more like marinara btw, and that was strike 3. It was bland and pureed to death. How do you screw up salsa? \n\nI knew I was in trouble if the chips and salsa were bad. I had a classic margarita and chicken fajitas. Margarita was awful...momocho in ohio city makes the best around here, I think. The Jalisco margarita wasn't even in the same playing field....strike 4. Now, onto the chicken fajitas. They might as well have called them Bell pepper and onion fajitas because there was hardly any chicken on my hot plate. Not only that, it was bland bland bland. Tasted like they only added a little salt and pepper, and perhaps had let them sit on that very hot plate to cook down. \n\nThe only thing good in my dish was the sour cream. Once again, the east side is a major disappointment. They make their attempts, but I think overall they are half-ass jobs. No wonder the east isn't a destination spot. We still have no place to eat out here.
