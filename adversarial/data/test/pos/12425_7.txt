Tom's Tavern is in downtown Phoenix on the NEC of Washington St and First Avenue. It's a great sit-down place to pop in for lunch, and you can usually get in and out in a hour. The fries are really good, as are the fish 'n' chips, and the brisket sandwich. A couple of the salads are also good. Only the mac 'n' cheese is something I wouldn't order again. \n\nThe inside has booths, tables, and a full bar. There are TVs for catching the news or the game. Outside seating is also available.
