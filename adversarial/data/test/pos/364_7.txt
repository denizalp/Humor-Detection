What can I say about this cleaners that has not been said?  Affordable, gets the job done, quick turnaround, and close to home.  \n\nI drop off my work clothes every 1-2 weeks and they always have it ready to be picked up within the next business day (unless you drop it off on Saturday, in which case, it is ready on Monday).  I always like my slacks to have a crease in the front and they always get it right - I look so sharp and oh-so professionale!\n\nThey are closed on Sunday. Parking is never that difficult.  They also have a refer-a-friend program so if you refer a friend, your friend and yourself get free drycleaning for two or three pieces (or maybe it's a $10 credit).\n\nGo - and tell them I referred you! haha. Although, I think you need my phone number and I'm not sure I want to give you that.
