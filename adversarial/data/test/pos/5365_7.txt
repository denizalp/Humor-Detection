Friday night, out for a Birthday celebration! I will start off with the statement, I really love Queen West!!\n\nWhat a delightful place, interesting mix of people. Yes it was rather hipster-y but I really liked this place. The age group was just perfect, not too young. \n\nSize wise: small, long, it was packed and difficult to move in. The make shift dance floor (I use this term loosely as it was just people dancing at the back by the DJ) was very small, yet my friends and I were still able to bust some moves.\n\nMusic: It was pretty hip hop themed, but that is my thing so I was H A P P Y. My friends and I could happily screech along to some good tunes!\n\nAtmosphere\/Service: Super chilled, friendly (and very fast) staff, some of the bar stools (maybe just one) had a horse saddle on it...not a good idea to try and mount this when the bar is a. packed to the gunnels b. you are a little intoxicated. They also have a suspended egg chair, nice touch! Thankfully no one was trying to use it as some sort of sex swing! (I say this as I have been to bars whereby people are making out in a similar style of chair and well...yes everyone can see you, the egg enclosure is not a private room). The decor is quirky, I loved it!\n\nDrinks: Reasonable priced, decent selection, mixed well.
