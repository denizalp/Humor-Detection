I recived a gift card from a member as I have several times in the past. It was good for a free 1 hour massage but since I wasn't a member they made me pay an additional $50 which was rather disappointing.  I had used the this type of gift card in the past without having to paying additional. I would rather go to massage one or element where their non-member rate is the same as massage envys member rate! :\/\n\nBe careful they will now charge you for canceling and require a credit card to hold the appt. This was my last time using this company.
