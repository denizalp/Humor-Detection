disclaimer: I HATE SHOPPING.  This is the basis for my review. \n\nHonestly, I'm quite surprised by all the negative reviews here.  I actually liked this \"mall| since it was outdoors.  Being in Vaughan Mills, Square One, Yorkdale, I always find there is a lack of seating when you drop whoever off (whether it be your sister, mom, cousin, g\/f) at whatever store.  After they spend about 30 minutes in one store, you get bored and need to take a seat.  So I liked the ample seating in addition to the open concept.  Having fresh air was, well a breathe of fresh air. I liked the lighted up fountain and the fireplace as well.\n\nAs for the stores itself, I think it was more expensive than US outlets, but I think that was to be expected considering the higher costs in Canada associated with retail vs. the US.  It basically is Vaughan Mills but outdoors with a few US shops (Kate Spade, Restoration Hardware). There were a few more \"guys\" stores, which was good such as Saucony, and Bose.  \n\nSo I think this is a cool place to hang out, just not to shop for super great deals, but hey, at least you can save gas so you don't have to drive your friends all over Heartland.
