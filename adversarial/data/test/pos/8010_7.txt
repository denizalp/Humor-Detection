Alamo Drafthouse Cinema is a fun spot for a nice date with your partner, or for a family outing. The theater's theme is retro\/old-school cool, and they show clips of old movies and old commercials instead of normal ads. It's not cheap once you factor in food and drinks, but I suppose if you only order sodas and popcorn, it's about the same price as going to the regular theater. \n\nYou can reserve seats ahead of time through their website. There's one shared table for every two seats. The lighting was underneath the table which is good for movie watching, but bad for seeing your meal. I think having dim lights that can turn on\/off on top of the tables would be more practical. I want to see what I'm eating! The tables were too far from the seat to comfortably sit back and also eat your meal. I've been to other dinner\/movie spots with tables that can be adjusted and I wish Alamo had those. \n\nThe food is surprisingly good for a movie theater and the drinks were strong. My boyfriend and I ordered the bean and queso dip with chips (SPICY!!), a pretzel, a side salad and a burger to split. I would happily eat here again. I had a cocktail and a beer, and he ordered two beers. They had a great selection of liquor and beers, including several locally brewed options! Nice! \n\nThe reason I cannot rate Alamo 5 stars is because their chairs DO NOT RECLINE. That is a make-or-break for a movie theater hoping to get 5 stars! The chairs were decent but not overly comfortable. I wasn't pleased about not being able to recline and certainly would've enjoyed my experience more if I could've laid back! Also, as mentioned above, the under-the-table lighting was sub par and the tables were too far away from the chairs. \n\n+4 food and drinks\n+5 fun ambiance\n-1 table lighting and placement\n-1 chairs don't recline
