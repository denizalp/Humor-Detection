This company is by far the worst company in customer service I have ever dealt with.  Their Customer Relations agent Patti Beck is by far the most ignorant person I have ever met.\n\nTried to disconnect my service, called the first time to understand the procedure.  Was greeted with Patti's attitude, like I have interrupted her day. I then explained why I needed to disconnect my service because of selling of my home and I have disconnected telephone service but alarm still sounds, she simply replied with \"we just need written notice.\" Which I understand is a standard procedure.\n\nHowever, after giving her all information she asked for, we haven't heard back from her for more than 3 business days, and when called back mid week to ask for status of request, I was then told she has gone for the day and she will get back to me the next day.  Keep in mind it was 2:20pm on a business day, I don't care if she has somewhere to go, someone else should have handled her duties on a business day and\/or complete her task before she's gone for the day.  My alarm has now been going off for 5days straight and I could not turn it off because Patti Beck decided my urgency is unimportant to her nor to her company.  They have no problem when I was with them and paid on time every month.\n\nI would strongly recommend anyone in the Las Vegas Valley to sought after another company for home security.  Same complaint can be found in BBB.org.
