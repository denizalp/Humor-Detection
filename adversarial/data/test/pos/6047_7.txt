In the peak of 2010's winter solstice, in a land of magical spectacles and bright lights called Las Vegas, Nevada, Yelpers were caught in a weird storm of strange weather and rain that no one really expects in this part of the world.  Rain was as rare as Mr. T wearing silver.  Not only was this storm rare and unusual, but there was a different storm hitting Las Vegas that none knew what to expect from.  The mystical appearances caused a disturbance to find the 'Wich that had it all.  And thus, cause the hunt for the best 'Wich in town!\n\nWhich Wich is in the race for the best sandwich shop in Las Vegas!  It's unique menu and ordering methods refresh the Vegas valley with a new taste and flavor that makes ordering sandwiches a definite memorable experience.  As seen in some earlier reviews, you order your 'Wich by choosing one or more bags from the wall of bags.  Different bags correspond what kind of meat comes on the sandwich.  Markers are conveniently located nearby to mark off different toppings, sauces, cheeses, peppers, etc. Go to the cashier, pay for your 'Wich and sit tight because you're moments from enjoying something different!\n\nMy GF and I ordered the Wicked (5 MEATS!: Turkey, Bacon, Roast Beef, Ham, and Pepperoni and 3 CHEESES!: Provolone, Cheez Whiz, Pepperjack [choices of Cheddar and Swiss also]) and I'll testify to it's wickedness! It was a bit overwhelming for my GF the way we threw everything on there (see pictures for sandwich details) but for me, it was a medley of all-star tastes! \"Less is more!\" says my GF, Dana Marie Dabu (reviews to come soon but soon to never come!). Try out our combo and let me know what you think! However, the Oreo cookie shake is LEGIT! Add it to your combo for just a few more dollars! You won't be sorry you did. They also have Hershey's Chocolate, and Banana! And, on your way to the restroom, check out the cool customer art section of the walls! I'll have to add my doodles here next time!\n\nI will definitely have to come back to try the rest of their great menu with so much to choose from. Oh, and if you like A1 like I do, they have it! :D
