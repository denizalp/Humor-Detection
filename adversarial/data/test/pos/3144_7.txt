A true meaning of gourmet market with a varieties of import groceries from mainly European's countries. This is a place to shop when you want to make a perfect gourmet meal at home.\n\nThey also have a variety selections of baked goods from around the city! I just love seeing all those cakes and pies lining up looking all delicious! It makes you want to buy everything home. \n\nFor the quality of the stuff, everything is well-priced.\n\nThe one problem I have with this place is that it's too small. I always bump into someone or something all the time.
