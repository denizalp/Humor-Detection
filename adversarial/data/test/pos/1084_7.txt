NO CHICKEN PRODUCTS. Seriously, in this day and age?\n\nI drove by this place hundreds of times, thinking it sounded pretty cool, and the other day finally bit the bullet and went inside. Put bluntly, there just isn't much of a reason to go back. \n\nI had no problems with the service or the speed at which we got our food, so I can at least list that as a positive for this place. \n\nBut their menu lacks any real variety. Sadly, the place is essentially a poor man's In-N-Out Burger, and they share In-N-Out's biggest flaw - a lack of any chicken products. Not everyone likes burgers and hot dogs, and you sure as hell can't make a meal out of just fries. In their defense, the place also had a breakfast menu, but they weren't serving it all day so that sort of defeats the purpose. \n\nThe big gimmick behind this place is they like to put chili on everything.... but seriously, can you run a whole restaurant around this premise?\n\nDisappointingly, the shakes are standard fast food fare, themselves being similar to In-N-Out. If I go into a retro-style restaurant, I want a quality 50s diner-style malt, not the crap I can go down the street to McDonalds and get.\n\nIf this place would add chicken products to their menu they would score some major points in my book.... but I somehow doubt that will happen anytime soon.
