oh God....I think this may be my first review where I add the tag line \"for Cleveland\"....I'm so sorry that I have to use it here...\n\nSo, this is decent BBQ....for Cleveland.\n\nDecided to commemorate MLK Day and a former Yelper by patronizing Hot Sauce Williams.  We had both been wanting BBQ all day long and figured today was just a good a day as any to give it a shot.  Reading the previous reviews, I found it quite funny that we wound up getting the exact same thing as Amy T. and her dining partner!  Ribs, coleslaw and fries for me...4 pieces of fried chicken, mac and cheese and fries for my gluttonous dining partner ;o)\n\nBut, getting to the point of ordering was an ordeal in itself!  We walked in and there were no menus posted....looking around for a couple of minutes, I was almost ready to go up to the girl behind the counter and ask her \"so, what do you think we should get\"...but I was kind of afraid to do that because of the response I envisioned in my head *cringe*.  So, I was pretty thankful when we finally looked around and found some printed up menus of their offerings....but, in what kind of order did they put these things?  There was no rhyme or reason to half of the menu, very confusing.\n\nOrdering was an event in itself, I started ordering with one girl and then she just walked away in the middle of my order, and then another chick came up and kind of finished it....I mean, I agree with Stef C. on this one, would it kill you to put a smile on your face and actually act like you enjoy getting paid??\n\nPluses, it was cheap, and it was fast, we had our food in less than 5 minutes and were out the door to enjoy it at home.\n\nPortions were HUGE, holy crap you could feed a family of four on the two dinners we ordered, neither of us could finish our meals.  Sauce was decent, ribs were a little grisly, chicken was pretty good....but in all reality, eating BBQ in Texas and Georgia has ruined me.  HSW is decent BBQ, for Cleveland.....this place would be out of business so fast in any of the Southern states due to the attitude you receive behind the counter and for the simple fact that it's just not that great when compared to some of the great BBQ places around the country.  \n\nLet's just say I think my BBQ craving is over until summer comes around and all the Yelpers can get together and do a proper cookout.
