What a great place for my beau and I to spend our 3rd anniversary together! \n\nWe came here (upon months of my insistence) for a lovely Sunday brunch and boy, was it everything I had hoped for and more! We both got the prix fixe at $25 each, which really ended up being a decent deal considering it included an appetizer, entree, and brunch cocktail. I wound up with the White Sangria, a refreshingly light concoction of chardonnay\/plum wines, cucumber, fruit, and rum. Absolutely amazing in the heat of summer! The mimosa was also quite good, but fairly basic.\n\nMy appetizer of choice brought me back dahn south! I ordered the beignets, tenderly topped with rose and blueberries. The presentation and idea were perfect, but I felt it could have been just a bit more flavorful. The boyfriend got the grilled sticky, sans bacon (for us plant-eaters here), which ended up being amazing. I'm sure it would have been just as good without our minor change, since sweet + salty = tastebud heaven.\n\nAnd the entree - mine the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend's the Ratatouille and Goat Cheese Omelet. Both were deeeelicious. The Eggs Benedict was lightly drizzled with black truffle atop an english muffin with a side salad of sliced mandarin oranges and mint. While my dish was fairly simple, it was just so perfect and satiating! No crazy frills here - just a well-done entree. I had a taste of the omelet as well, which was equally as good. The mildness of the vegetables was offset by the rich and sour goat cheese, which acted as a perfect complement. I also couldn't stop stealing fingerling potatoes from my dining partner's plate! (Yes, there was a \"potato tax\" of 3 pieces every time he left for the bathroom or turned around.)\n\nAll in all, a great place! Service was professional and polite and the venue itself was light-filled and spacious. I can't wait to go back again!
