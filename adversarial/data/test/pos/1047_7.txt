I have to say that things did not start off all that auspiciously with Joey Yorkdale and I, but in the end they won me over. \n\nI wanted to make reservations for 7 people, and I tried to do so on their website and I got an error message saying to try again later or to call the restaurant. I tried again later several times and got the same message. So I called the restaurant and they told me that for reservations of groups of 7 or more I need to send an email to a special email address that they gave me on the phone. I then sent an email to the given address and was finally able to make the reservation. Hmm, why did I have to go through so many hoops? Why didn't the website just instruct me to send the email? \n\nThe email I got back confirming my reservation also informed me that my reservation will only be held for 15 minutes and at least 50% of my party had to be there before they would seat us.  I guess it's good to lay all the rules on the table, but this didn't make me feel very welcomed.  I felt like their attitude was \"you want to eat here more than we need your business.\"  I had never been to a JOEY before, neither this location nor any other one.  One of my friends recommended this place, and that is the only reason I kept the reservation.  Otherwise, I would have cancelled and chosen another venue.  \n\nWell, I am happy to say that things got much better when I actually got to the restaurant. The restaurant is really aesthetically pleasing in decor and service was really friendly. Our server was Kwaku and he was awesome.  He was very personable, and made helpful recommendations. The food was also excellent.\n\nI had the Farmers Market Chicken Salad ($20.50) and it was a good size and full of delicious ingredients. It had real mixed greens (no cheapie iceberg, thank goodness), grilled chicken, grapes, peas, tomatoes, avocado, cheese, almonds, beets, radishes, and cabbage. It normally comes with corn, but I asked them to hold that. I asked what kind of dressing the salad came with and Kwaku said that it's a French dressing that they make in house, but I could get a different dressing too and he listed them for me. The chili lime dressing sounded interesting so I chose that one and he said that I could have both the chili lime and French dressing, on the side of course, so I could try both. How nice was that? I took him up on the offer. I definitely liked the chili lime dressing better, but the French dressing was good too. It had a lot more bite to it than other French dressings I've had. Salad ingredients were fresh and I really enjoyed my salad.\n\nMy husband got the Lobster and Crab Ravioli ($24.50) and he thought it was fantastic. Very rich and decadent though. It came with 4 shrimp on top of the bed of ravioli. I had a ravioli and it was indeed good, but I liked my choice better. \n\nMy other friends at the table seemed to enjoy their meals too. \n\nAdmittedly, I am not usually a fan of big chains. I personally much prefer to support smaller mom and pop joints. However, after I got over the initial reservations situation, I was quite impressed with JOEY Yorkdale. \n\nAs the name implies, this restaurant is inside Yorkdale Shopping Centre, but the entrance is exterior to the mall (you cannot enter from inside the mall). Parking is usually a nightmare at Yorkdale, but at least it's free.
