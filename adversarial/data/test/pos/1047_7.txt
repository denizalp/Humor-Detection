This is the worst company ever to deal with. They have no compassion for the homeowners and pocket cash sales! They make up prices for items rather then doing the research to get a fair price on items. This company was hired because they came highly recommended to us. I couldn't be more disappointed with their level of customer service. They can't even provide you with a list of the items that were priced and what they were sold for! How can you trust a company that provides the homeowner with no receipt!
