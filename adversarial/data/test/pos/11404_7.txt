Tradition. That is what this cute soul food cafe is steeped in. The menu is a tribute to a lovely NOLA influenced granny, RIP, who lived to the ripe old age of 97 1\/2 and who apparently was a gifted cook.  These are her recipes. Consider yourself honored to meet her through her granddaughter's perseverence to share her food.\n\nLocated on the north end of town, near Nellis AFB, this is a very attractive, clean, spacious eating establishment that should be taken seriously by locals and travellers as well. It is desireable not only for the food but for its location far from the craziness that is downtown and on the Strip. This is in the land of copius parking and chill attitude.\n\nThe Catfish has a lovely cornmeal crunch, not at all greasy. It comes with great tasting tartar sauce and your choice of 3 sides.  The servings were so big I felt I was looking at them thru a magnifying glass.\n\nThe braised oxtail came with 3 pcs as big as a fist and a choice of two sides. The meat was fall off the bone tender, and the pan gravy was plate lickable.\n\nEven the cornbread muffin was unique with an interesting crusty muffin top. Served with REAL butter.\n\nMy mac n cheese side (oh my goodness wonderful) was made exactly as I crave, with lots of the right kind of cheddar cheese.\n\nThe collard greens were tender and hammy and tangy. Oh so good.\n\nThen there was the fried cabbage with bacon.  I could eat that all day long.\n\nAnd yep, Mr B indulged in tasty Black Eyed Peas.\n\nI didn't, but if you want to see what all the hype is over chitterlings, you don't have to go down South. They have them here.\n\nThey offer excellent service and a delightfully cheerful vibe.\n\nYou have no idea what authentic soul food is about until you come here.  I have tried many places, but this ranks #1 for me.  I would definitely go out of my way to eat here again.
