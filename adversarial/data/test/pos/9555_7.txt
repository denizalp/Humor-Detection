My wife and I went into the petland store on marks st. In Henderson Nevada. We fell in love with a 4 mo old boxer puppy and we purchased it. Mind you the prices aren't cheap 2500 dollars later but we agreed and we're happy about the new addition to the home. The sales Mngr told my wife about the 48 hr return policy in case it doesn't work out. We get the pup home and it couldn't of been a better day for us and the pup. The next morning when we were by ourselves alone with our 2 yr old daughter the puppy became very aggressive and started to go after the baby. At first we thought it was just playing but it was getting more and more angry to the point of showing teeth and growling and really going after the baby. Even when my wife got in front of the dog and baby it snapped at her and tried to get around her to get to the baby. We had 3 boxers before this and never experienced a 4 mo old dog that aggressive. So we decided to take back the dog to be safe and when we get there they gave us the biggest run around trying to return the dog. They said it was in our contract to pay 40% of the total fee of the dog to return it. We told them that we are returning it because it is real aggressive towards the baby and not because we made a quick decision. The reg Mngr told my wife she will not help us we f stuck by the contract. She called her district Mngr and she came down and listened and they still charged us 500 dollars to give the dog back. We showed her the bite marks the dog left on the baby's leg and everything but would not budge on the price. We should of gotten our money back. Very greedy place. Would never buy another thing from that store or any other of there stores.
