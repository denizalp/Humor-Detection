Best pita bread IN THE VALLEY! I crave the pita bread enough to make me order a salad (a basket of it comes as a side with a salad) and their Ranch dressing is tasty (Hidden Valley packet tasty). \n\nMy go-tos are: the goat cheese (with spring greens) or the gyro feta salad. Salads are around $10 but pretty filling.\n\nNon-pita lovers can get burgers or pizza :)
