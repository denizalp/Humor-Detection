Convenient healthy meal option after a workout at LVAC in the same building. Surprisingly flavorful for health food. Get the sauces on the side and steer clear of the appetizers.\n\nSalmon wrap with extra veggies is my go-to, but the Mongolian beef bowl backs a punch of protein as well- filling and flavorful, ask to add extra garlic. In addition to wraps, bowls, and apps, the menu has protein smoothies and boba drinks. \n\nMeals are generally under $10\/person, unless you Jay-Cutter-size it. Restaurant is clean, employees are efficient, lots of random Buddha statues on display. Can't think of any other healthy options in the area, very good location for them to be.
