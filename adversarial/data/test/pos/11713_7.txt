There's a guy outside dressed up like a piece of toast. How could you not like this place?!\n\nThe key phrase you must remember if you want to have brunch here: arrive early. They do not take reservations. Expect a wait. However, it's not so bad. Toast has a complimentary coffee bar (cute little paper cups) and cornhole outside. The place is hopping. Diverse crowd. Kids, families, boozy brunchers, dogs of all kinds.\n\nOur group of seven arrived at 10AM Sunday. The wait for us was only around ten minutes. We were seated outside on the patio. Beautiful day for brunch outside.\n\nI debated forever on my order. Basically, I fought with myself over which version of eggs benedict to get. Come on, there's nothing better than cutting into a soft poached egg and watching the delicious drizzle. I finally landed on the Cali Benny: Poached Eggs, Avocado, Tomato, English Muffin & Hollandaise. Great sauce. It came with a side of potatoes. I'm usually not the biggest fan of home fries, but these were seasoned and yummy. Didn't even need ketchup or hot sauce. I ate everything on my plate.\n\nQuite possibly my favorite thing about this place: you pay at the counter. Think about it. When you go to brunch, you usually have to split your check up a bunch of different ways. Takes time for a server to do that, close everyone out. Here, you just take your check and go straight to the cashier. Makes turnover time for tables quicker.\n\nI'm definitely a fan. If I can ever get my crew going by 10am, this is the place we'll hit up for some breakfast goodness. Now if only we could get the state of North Carolina to serve me a mimosa before noon on a Sunday....
