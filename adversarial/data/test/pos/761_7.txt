Every now and then my company does me a solid .. I get to be home and get paid to be here. I usually go home to my own bed, but this time, since my husband had conferences at another hotel, I asked him to join me for the next thirty hours here and make a date night out of it. I mean, I am getting paid for this and it's a great hotel in a great part of Phoenix! The location is superb. You are close to Chase Field here and conventions and conferences take place all around. The lobby has infused water stations, which is a nice touch in hot, dry Arizona. You must have a guest room key to access any of the guest room floors. I like that. I wish ALL hotels that I stayed in around the world were like that! The rooms are decent sized, quiet and the beds are super comfortable with plush pillows. Like all Sheratons, you can count on Starbucks and Keurig too in your room. My room also had a great view of the city. The awesome gym here overlooks the olympic sized pool. The hotel restaurant, District, has a great bar with awesome happy hour specials. District, itself is also a very good restaurant for a 'hotel restaurant' using fresh herbs from the garden they have on property. In the morning, there is a large buffet breakfast served, as well. Or Starbucks to grab and go. My husband valeted the vehicle and as long as you have a meal here, your ticket will be validated and that will be complimentary. All in all, this Sheraton is in the mecca of downtown. You can walk to anything that you need or want or have to be at for business and the ASU downtown campus isn't far away, either. I found the staff here to be friendly, helpful and accommodating.
