Love it, love it, love it!  They have renewed my faith in food trucks.  I tried them at the Great Las Vegas Beer Festival.  It took a while.  But, OMG, the Zorba, Godfather, and mac and cheese are sooooo delicious!!!!   So worth the wait and the friendliest staff ever.  Plus a frequent buyer card!  I'm hooked!!!
