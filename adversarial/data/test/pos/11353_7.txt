These days I'm an athlete as well as a mathlete. And a total \"player\" as well as a sports player. But when I was in Primary School, I was \"simply Geek.\"\n\nHowever, I don't think even the most tastebud-less of Geeks would really love these Gyros. They're more expensive than almost any in Cleveland, which is a city of very cheap Gyros and mini Gyros (most towns don't offer mini Gyros but the best places in Cleveland do, often for under $5). So already we got off on a bad foot considering I was charged closer to 10 than 5 for a Gyro.\n\nBut then the fact that I found the whole thing - bread sugary\/store-bought\/bland, veggies wilted, sauce bland like sour cream, and meat not particularly flavoured or tasty - to be one of the less good Gyros I've had anywhere. There was a really long wait for it too, and I was starving, so that's further damnation.\n\nI'd recommend Best Gyros (both locations) out east, or Gyro World out West of Cleveland, for the very best in town. The one in West Side Market is not very good either. But I totally support family businesses so I'll give them 3 stars.
