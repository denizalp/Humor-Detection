I have lots of lovely Native American jewelry and I can proudly say some of my favorite 'new' vintage pieces come from Silver Star Jewelry.  I have been coming here for years, even before I lived here!  Also the sales staff is professional and not 'snobby' as other jewelry stores in Scottsdale.  Whenever I have a visitor in town I always take them here if they are interested in Native American jewelry.  \n\nSilver Star has a great selection of vintage pieces, which is my personal favorite, and a variety of styles from different tribes from around the country.  Whether you are looking for a 'starter' piece or a huge string of squash blossoms this is the place.  As in every jewelry store in Old Town the selling can be very high pressure and 'car salesman-ish\", however I have gotten to know the employees here quite well and they do know their stuff.  Andy is my go-to 'jewelry guy' and I feel awful that I don't remember the names of the other two ladies that have helped me in the past.  If they don't know the answer to any questions a customer has, they have people on staff that can get answers for you.  Some of the best jewelry makers\/traders in the craft of Native American Jewelry have been bringing their wares into Silver Star for a long time because the owner has built a great rapport with them.  \n\nSometimes I just go in to look around and see what is new, but that can be an expensive game :)
