I was bored one day, did a Yelp search on myself  \"LJ R\", and this place popped up. I really need a new hobby.  The first thing that caught my attention was the $0.99 tacos. They have $0.99 tacos Tuesdays through Thursdays all day so why not right? And on Wednesdays, it's $0.99 Al Pastor tacos all day. Hey today's Wednesday. Did LJ R. go to LJR? Nah maybe next week.\n\nLJR has a $5 order minimum for card usage so I had no problem with ordering 5 Al Pastor tacos. It came with pepper, green onion, lime, and sauce on the side. The tacos weren't that bad, not quiet like the more popular al pastor taco spots around Vegas but satisfying. I liked the meat, it was more lean and less greasy but kind of mild in the flavor I was expecting. It was topped with fresh onion and celantro. Most my tacos never held together and the fillings burst out the middle of the tortillas, I just picked them up with my fingers.\n\nThe service is friendly. My drink was refilled and food brought out in a reasonable amount of time. They served complementry chips and salsa. Not a lot of tables inside but they weren't that busy. Clean looking minus the wall of containers on the counter. The rest of the menu sounds good and are reasonably prices. It's hard to say if I fan or not but I'm at least leaning towards whatever side is positive. I'll have to go back and try more.
