Still great and such a chill little place, but I still don't want you to know about it. \n\nIt has nothing to do with there being a clique of regulars here that you will be excluded from, or with there being a secret handshake- no. It's such a small space with so little room that barstools are at a premium and very coveted.\n\nThere aren't any taps but this is the best place in the valley to try a new (or new to you) beer.
