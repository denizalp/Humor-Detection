Yesterday we were setting up our new house and needed a soft water system. We didn't want to go through the hassle of ordering it online and installing ourselves. My husband did a quick Yelp search and Rain Water came up with really positive reviews. Their bright yellow and blue building is easy to spot and there is plenty of parking.\n\nJoe Furtado walked us through the different systems, showed us features, discussed pros and cons. They have plenty of options in all different price ranges. We chose a combination of salt and reverse osmosis. The best part was that Joe could come and install it himself that same afternoon! The whole process from walking in to signing the paperwork took less than 15 minutes.\n\nThat same afternoon Joe came by and set up the new system, complete with drilling a hole in our kitchen countertop to add a beautiful drinking fountain that matches our faucet. Installation was only about an hour. \n\nAll the positive reviews are true. This place is honest, straightforward and efficient. If you know nothing about soft water systems, Joe will give you a tutorial and make the process simple and painless. Their pricing is fair and Joe's customer service is excellent!
