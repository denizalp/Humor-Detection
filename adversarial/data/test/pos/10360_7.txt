Tendou matcha has reinvented itself into Patisserie Kirin - it's a nice change! It's still in the same location (but now in a much bigger space facing Highway 7) but a lot is different.\n\nThey've gone the clean\/minimalistic route for the interior, with faux white marble tabletops and black. It does a good job of being clean looking without being too stark (which I find Duo Patisserie to be) because of the nice natural light coming in through the windows. It was quite comfortable there.\n\nVery roomy inside, no one was there when I went and so I got excellent and friendly service.\n\nI bought a fruit tart ($4.75) and their zangetsu (black and white sesame with white chocolate, $6.75). Both were delicious - the zangetsu was super heavy on the sesame so if you like sesame this would be a good choice! The fruit tart was refreshing with custard, which I really like. The only reason this is three stars is that I got mild food poisoning from the fruit tart... I recall there being a Yelp review about issues regarding this particular dessert as well but I think it's been deleted. I think it would be good for the business to look into their supplier or perhaps look at how their fresh fruit is handled. It happens sometimes. I love fruit tarts and it was delicious, but I think I will avoid fruit tarts from here for the time being.\n\nTheir soft serve has changed a bit as well - very rich in matcha flavour, though icier in texture than before. Still good.\n\nWill be back! Just not for the fruit tarts.
