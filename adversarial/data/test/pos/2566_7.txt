Fiirst first time going really pleasant people did a really good job on my feet and my hands even know they were getting busy.  People kept coming in they didn't rush to do my nails which a lot of places do to keep getting money they concentrate on the customer at hand and I prescient that and I love my little nails so cute & so creative.\n\nReturning visit scheduling issue:\nSo they are open until 11pm but after 7pm appt only which is find since i was calling to schedule an appt. they had nothing until after 8pm. Theres a $5 charge to make an appt after 7pm mind you i asked for an appt at 6pm and there was nothing available. I don't understand why they have extended hours if you cant even book without paying extra. I use to go to elaines nails before my girl left and they also have extended hours. Not thrilled about any extra charges for the same service. They shouldn't list their hours as such if you cant walk in or schedule with a penalty fee
