Kristin C.'s review prompted a review from me!\nI *heart* the Phoenix Zoo.  I volunteered here while in high school.  I went on an awesome tour with the zoo's veterinarian when I thought I wanted her job (I learned that I prefer just loving my dog and visiting zoos).  The people who work here are amazing and love sharing knowledge about the animals.\nI live in Chicago now, and though LP Zoo is pretty cool, I much prefer the Phoenix Zoo.  The animal habitats are bigger - so you don't always see as many animals, but I like knowing that the critters are running about and are not cramped into little cages.  The Phx Zoo offers so many educational opportunities for kids (the summer camp is great!!!) and fun events for adults, too.  If you really like the zoo, check into getting a membership, you help out animals and get to skip the lines for buying tickets!\nDefinitely follow Kristin C's advice and wear comfy shoes, sunscreen, and drink lots of water - the zoo is huge and you will be walking quite a bit. \nMy favorite part is the AZ trail, it is so cool to see the animals that are native to our part of the country, and the exhibits are really well done. \nGo check it out!
