WARNING: Unless you like an Ã¼ber crowed bar filled with a bunch of drunks who just got done playing football, avoid Saturday afternoons at Treehouse. Other than that, come all! \n\nI actually really dig The Treehouse, just not on Saturday afternoons. There is nothing appealing to me about packing a bar with hundreds of very inebriated, sweaty people. I don't have anything against those who are in weekend sports leagues. In fact, more power to ya! I'm too lazy! But you're just asking for obnoxious behavior when you get an entire league together in one bar... especially one that has been drinking all day. \n\nThe patio is totally money during the summer. Huge, tons of tables and pretty chill during the week. Plus free Wi-Fi!!! I may have used it for a happy hour\/work zone on more than one occasion. What can I say... I'm always productive. \n\nOn random weeknights it's fun to stop by and hang out inside too. It's usually relatively quiet and you can easily enjoy a pint or two. I like that they have Hoegaarden on tap too. It just tastes so much better that way. Typically the bartenders are nice and talkative as well. I mean, if you're talking about something other than the huge tree in the middle of the bar. :-D
