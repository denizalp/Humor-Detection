So... breaded, deep fried, Kool-Aid soaked dill pickles with spicy mayo dip. Damn, you know you want to!\nAlso, a two-player Atari game console that doubles as a table for two. Play every game you remember from your childhood while you wait for the cocktails and pickles to come: Pacman, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, you get it... they're all there under a glass top, with limitless plays for you and your date. \n\nOK, COCKTAILS. \nThese cocktails are epic. There's a large selection of cocktails that come in giant mason jars, about the quantity of four drinks in one, complete with juicy fruit slices on a skewer - starfruits, strawberries, kiwis, all of it. You feel famous just sitting with one of these in front of you. Other cocktail choices are equally exciting, such as the black charcoal cocktail (charcoal is good for you!) called, appropriately, the Vampire. There are fabulous flaming cocktails that are performed by the bartender just for you, fancy-glassed cocktails, an assortment of whiskey cocktails and it goes on. You'll need to spend some time with that menu. They're all so interesting, you might leave loaded. Oh, and don't forget - check in on Yelp and you get a free shooter of your server's choice. And... folks, that's EVERY time you check in, not just a one-time offer! This place is generous.\n\nSpeaking of generous - there's much more to eat here than just pickles, too. The foods include really great pub-esque sandwiches and fries combos, burgers, salads (big, awesome salads), etc etc etc - the menu is actually quite extensive for what it is! You won't leave hungry by any stretch of the imagination. I couldn't finish my plate alone and had to force the leftovers on my manfriend.\n\nThe d√©cor is fab. It's warm, cozy, tasteful, casual, elegant, relaxed - all these things together, which is rare. You have cushy booths mixed with steakhouse style seating, so whatever you're in the mood for - table for two or tucked in group. Also, best (funkiest) bathrooms in Montreal. Go see for yourself. They are in a really perfect location, gotta say, but it might be easy to miss if you're not watching for it. Right on Sainte Catherine, close to the Guy-Concordia metro. Even though it's a popular spot, it's got quite a large interior, so don't worry about not getting a seat. I'll arm wrestle you for the Atari game table, though!
