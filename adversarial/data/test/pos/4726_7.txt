This review is Only for the Lobster Rolls that LUMA created for Nuit Blanche as part of their late night bites\n\nThe rolls were perfect: great consistency, refreshing and light...and very summery. It was a tad salty but i washed it down with a root beer float and it was great. The Chef was very friendly and put together a platter of 10 lobster rolls for our famished group. \n\nToo bad i can't say the same for its pathetic sister restaurant O&B Canteen. Terrible food (see my review for O&B Canteen and keep away until they spruce up service there)
