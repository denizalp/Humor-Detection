This is my go to boba spot when I am shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Center. Its not the best boba drinks I've had but its not bad. They're cutesy cartoon characters and clever drink names  always entertain me while Im waiting in line deciding which new one I want to try. I've had a couple of the teas, but my favorite is the Mango Tango. Sweet, light, refreshing, and not too sweet. I've had a couple of milk tea types from here and it was so sweet that I didn't finish and had to throw it away. I think its hit and miss for the different flavors. \n\nEnvironment: 3\/5 ( by the foodcourt next to Lush )\nFood: 3\/5\nPrice: 4\/5 \nService: 4\/5
