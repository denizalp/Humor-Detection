Right off the bat this place was annoying. The line doesn't start where it says it does, there was a 20 minute wait for chicken and a 30 minute wait for ribs. There was no ice and they were out of lemonade (I don't drink soda). The food was good but with the hassle of everything else I can't say it was worth it. The staff was kind of rude and stared a lot, which was very annoying.\n\nYeah, I probably won't go back.
