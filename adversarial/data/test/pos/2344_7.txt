Never have I ever encountered such abhorrent customer service in my life which has prompted me to post my first restaurant review. Firstly, I do have to say that the food is pretty good considering the lack of ramen and sushi options in Calgary and Edmonton. However,  I will never step foot into this establishment again due to the utter disrespect my family received from Jenna on front desk duty. She was asian with blonde hair if you'd like to avoid her.\n\nWe ordered the \"sushi tray for one\" tonight and I was pretty excited to have the special scallop that was supposed to come with the order. When received, I noticed that it was missing (to which I recalled the same thing happened last time I ordered it). We proceeded to wave down our waiter to ask why it was missing to which he brought our tray back to the kitchen for clarification. He ended up bringing it back with the special scallop and profusely apologized for the mistake and neglecting to let us know of the change prior to ordering. \n\nAFTER my sister paid for the bill at the front desk, Jenna at the front desk told my sister that she should respect the service people at Shikiji more. I was utterly shocked to hear this because we were nothing but polite to our server and was appreciative that he acknowledged his mistake. I think it takes a lot of hubris and cowardice to antagonize a long time customer like Jenna did post-payment. I mean if you have the guts to accuse someone of treating your colleague poorly, stand up for him\/her then and there, not after someone has paid the bill and tipped. \n\nShe said that the kitchen had full authority to change items on the menu at whim and I should have taken notice of the fine print on the menu. She also said that if I really wanted the special scallop so bad I should've confirmed with the waiter while ordering. First of all, when I look at a menu I do not cross-examine every line item. Secondly, having that policy is fine and well, but if something is going to be changed (arbitrarily it also seems because the special scallop was very fresh tonight.), that should be verbally communicated to the customer while ordering. Jenna was EXTREMELY rude when I confronted her disrespect towards my sister. I say this because she was smirking, argumentative, and not taking my concern seriously. She even invited me to write an online review so I did. Jenna also said that technically the tray could come with completely different fish than indicated on the menu at any time. If that is the case, the menu should just say it comes with assorted fish (like it happens to be on your ONLINE menu). \n\nI recommend management to take action and teach your front staff to respect loyal clientele. I have been supporting this restaurant for the last 6 years and it is a frequent stop for many of my business lunch meetings. In the meantime, I will no longer be visiting Shikiji and will actively express my negative experience to my business partners, centres of influences, clients, and friends and family. I am sure other sushi establishments will be happy to have our businesses.
