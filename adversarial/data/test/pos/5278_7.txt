I am back from the much downsized 2010 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas....I was here on business.\n\nLet me first preface this Yelp review by saying that I came to the show not expecting much.  This year's CES's biggest NEW technology featured was the 3D everything for your televisions, home computers, and gaming systems.  With the recent success of Avatar 3D the movie, 3D entertainment and programming for your home is here to stay and coming to a store near you!\n\nAnother NEW interesting technology you need to look for soon is Apps\/Applications for your new televisions. Imagine using a Skype Video Conferencing app on your television....NEATO MOSQUITO!!\n\nAs for the other vendors, technologies and gadgets at the CES show....the Main Central Hall was the place to be.  The biggest WOW factor came from big vendors such as Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were the biggest draws for OOOHs & AAAHs! Other downsized halls featured not so interesting vendors, but offered many interesting fun things for the inner geek in me.\n\nOne BIG eye opening product of note that I saw at the show was the Panasonic 152\" Plasma High Definition Television....DARN....it does not fit in my car!  (See my photo)\n\nI feel that CES shows of past were more interesting and more innovative than the 2010 show. But maybe it is the sign of the times and next year's show will be another downward spiral of innovative and affordable consumer technology.  \n\nAs for me, I don't have the $$$$$ to purchase any of the new and fun consumer technology, but it is always fun to dream!  =)
