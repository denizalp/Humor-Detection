Keep Looking!!!!\n\nDon't waste your time or money with this company.  I dropped my boat off on a Tuesday and was told it would be ready to be picked up on Friday for a weekend of boating.  I called Friday to pick up my boat and they informed with an attitude the boat won't be ready until Monday.  I then called Monday to pick up my boat and they informed me it now won't be finished for another day.  It ended up taking them a full week to complete a simple oil change on my boat.  When the time came to pick up my boat the same poor attitude and customer service was still in full affect.  I showed up in my work clothes and when it was time to hook the boat up to my truck all the employees disappeared leaving me alone in a shirt and tie to hook up my trailer.  Horrible experience and will travel further and pay more money in order to not do business with this company again.
