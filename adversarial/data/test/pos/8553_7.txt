I guess I came at the right time to this Old Navy because I had a gift card to use I decided to check it out and I'm glad I did because there were so many deals! And many of their deals had extra deals to go with that! The store was clean and sales racks were not all messy and on the floor and sizes were in the right places that made it easy to shop . I love their flip flops in every color and you can't beat the price of $2.00 a pair . Dressing rooms were clean with no left behinds and everything was well stocked and I did not have to hunt anyone down for help so that was good . I noticed they had many Burt's Bees chap stick and they have many different colors also I like there body mist , my favorite is Sea Salt Fig , the name does not sound inviting but the smell is really fresh so it's a must try !
