Booking the shuttle was easy.  I gave the sales rep my flight info and she had my ride secured within minutes. I was initially scheduled for pick up at 6, but I asked to be picked up at 5:30. No problem. \n\nThe shuttle was prompt; I was on my way to Sky Harbor by 5:40. No heavy lifting of my bag either. SuperShuttle uses propane to fuel the vans instead of gas--it's cheaper and has less emissions. I like this because I'm an environmentally-conscious individual. \n\nThe one drawback of SuperShuttle is sharing the van with other people. Luckily we only had one stop and it was relatively easy to find. Plus, it was on the way. \n\nThe driver was friendly and we listened to some good 'tunes on the way down there. A very safe ride, indeed. \n\nVery economical--$22 each way.  It's cheaper than that obligatory meal and\/or gift given to the lucky person that offers to give you a ride. \n\nI'm satisfied.
