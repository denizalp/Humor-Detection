Yeah it's ok here.  Good place to go if you just want to lounge and not necessarily go to a 'club'.   It's unpretentious and easy to get in.  I didn't see any servers and had to order from the bar which is no big deal.   Drinks are good enough (for a measured pour place).\n\nThere's a small dance floor with beats from guest DJ's.  When DJ BStang plays the music is great and the videos are cool.
