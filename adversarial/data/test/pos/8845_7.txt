Another solid local 808 food in Vegas. I have been to the other location on Durango. Not much difference in the food for the most part pretty consistent BIG portions and solid local food. I believe the menu at Express is half the size? Not like the menu at Durango location that more like book open up couple pages here just one page action. The dishes on the menu here seem to be the popular items or for me the local food enjoy the most! They run daily different specials so might want call in see if you tried the whole menu or want something else. I came to get dinner on the way home from KONA viewing party. I got steered from the one and only Shirley B get me some Furikake Chicken. Winnah! For the most part most of the pieces was good size although have to admit or agree with Marie T some of it was more deep fried crumbs. The portion size is so big but really good at same time. The sauce really enjoyed! They do put lot of sauce but then again everything here is huge including the sauce. I literally had half my two scoops of rice soaked in it. In good way.  I got some Poke action. I got the Hawaiian Style Poke Half Order. It was good. The quality of the tuna was solid, the sauce was ok, and best part was the limu. It been long time since had some. It adds so much flavor to any Poke. Good. I feel down the road Poke Express is much better and they have better selection. I would still order the Poke again if needed get my fix in.\n\nOverall definitely place would stop by again!
