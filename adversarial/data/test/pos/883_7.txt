THE BEST PIE!  (But the food is just ok)\n\nTo enjoy a slice of their chocolate peanut butter pie is an absolute MUST!  The slices are huge, and they are so rich and delicious.  The other varieties of pie are good as well, but the chocolate peanut butter cannot be beat.\n\nWith that said, the food is just ok... or slightly worse.  I've eaten their twice and only go back for dessert now.  The salad bar is nice and the service is above-average.  Whatever you do, DO NOT GET GRAVY!  It is like some nasty, brown jello.\n\nWait, did I mention how delicious the chocolate peanut butter pie is???
