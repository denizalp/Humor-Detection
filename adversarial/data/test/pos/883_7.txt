Brought my son to the urgent care here today and we had a great experience. Everything moved quickly and smoothly. We were told how long to expect the process to be. The nurses and physician were very kind and caring. The care center was clean, and they offered water in the waiting room. Only complaint is some of the care providers did not introduce themselves. I like knowing who's who. We are grateful for the compassionate and timely care my son received here today.
