I went there at 8pm, they close at 9pm.  There was about 2-3 tables worth of people there.  Their staff didn't greet me when I walked in.  I waited in the seating area for 5 whole minutes without someone welcoming me into the restaurant.  I made sure they were aware I am there, but nobody made the effort to seat me.  My guess is that they don't like late comers.  I thought that was rude.  I ended up eating next door.
