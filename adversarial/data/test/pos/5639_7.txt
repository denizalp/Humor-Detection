Ew man.  The jerk pork was so old it took A LOT of horsepower to chew.  It wasn't spicy at all, clearly watered down. Barely any rice. The only jerk involved in the making of this meal was the chef.  I just don't even get why you bother to have a tip cup Georgina.  This time I mean it, I'm not going back.. It's inconsistent, she's always mad and as good as the food is when it IS good, its so nasty when its bad. Sometimes the pork is 87% fat chunks.  This place stinks.
