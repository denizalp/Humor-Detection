My husband had a conference and since he was presenting he was staying here because the conference was held at the Mandalay.  The hotel is very nice, it has a very modern, contemporary design.  Our room was a suite, so we had a living area and 1 and 1\/2 bathroom.  That was awesome.  The fitness center was really good, a lot more equipment than most hotels.  I ended up working out so hard that I was sore for a couple of days.  My only complain is the pool.  You have to walk through the Delano casino, then the Mandalay casino, down a set of stairs, through some doors then outside more walking.  Had I known it was so far I would have skipped the treadmill.  The other thing that is not cool is the lounge chairs that are close to the water are not free.  They are $100 for the day.  I was there for only 1 hour, so I was not going to pay for that.  I stayed back a couple of rows, but didn't get in the pool, since I had my wallet and didn't want to leave it there.  Overall, I had a great time and I would stay there again, but wouldn't plan to go to the pool.
