FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS!!!! OMG... if you are vegan or not, come here right now!  This place is absolutely stinking epic! I have to tell you I've had some really bad cinnamon buns, cinnamon rolls, cinnamon things... In my time! This place is so good!! everything is amazing! I ended up leaving with five buns and one set of mini buns because the first one I got was so good! The frosting is perfect the cinnamon rolls are soft and not stale or crusty! \n\nThis place is nestled in with a bunch of different shops so the parking here can be a bit of a challenge... But I promise you it's totally worth it! This place is very small but the owners have done a great job and segmenting out where you wait in line and where you eat your food... See you never feel like you're being crammed in there.\n\nI will definitely come back here again and again. Don't forget to join up for their loyalty rewards program... You have the opportunity to get some free buns!! \n\nLoving this new found treasure :)  - WAY TO GO GUYS!
