I don't live here. I won't live here. My sister lives here and is now trying to break her lease. My fianc√© and I were considering on moving here. But not anymore!They've been open for months, and might have about 10 rooms rented out... I think we know why...  The only thing great is the pool. The quality of the apartment is very European aka small and ikea-ish. The hallways are very dark.. The parking is horrible if your household has two cars. There is no designated uncovered parking like most apartments have. They'll tell you to use the restaurant's parking... Don't believe me? Go for a tour. Erika says most people that live there don't even have a car... Come up with a solution not a lie... \n\nErika, @51's assistant community manager is rude, she took us on a tour and was very dry, not personable, and was more like a sales person.  \n\nShe told me that my sister just needs to sign a form to break the lease and CONFIRMED emailing it back was ok because she is out of the country. She emails in the form on 9\/1. I follow up days later and her staff says there is nothing on file stating she is leaving. Erika emails back saying that a form needs to be signed in person and not just emailed. Really? She's out of the country. We just want to break the lease, pay the buyout fees, turn in our keys and move out on 10\/1. \n\nLook at Broadstone Sixteen 75 on East Morten Avenue before considering @51, trust me!! Place is amazing! It's less expensive by far, has more square footage with great amenities!! This is where we are moving. \n\nIf you plan on moving into @51,  ask to work with someone else other than Erika. \n\nGood luck!
