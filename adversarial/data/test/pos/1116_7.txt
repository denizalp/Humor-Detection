If you agree to never have more than 2 guests at the pool, not be allowed to use your speakers and listen to what you would like (even when none of the residents have an issue with it), have to come all the way down to the lobby to have your guest parking validated, have concierge who do not greet you half the time... this place is for you. The residents are actually really cool and the units are nice, but the rules are senseless and most of the residents events are poorly planned. In other words, the resident event is mostly enjoyed by some of the staff members who max out their budget too soon for a resident to be able to enjoy anything. My favorite concierges were fired for the most random reasons. We keep having to deal with brand new people and it's just uncomfortable. For the price, you may want to look elsewhere. I used to love living here, the precious property manager was extremely accommodating and efficient and now I really can't wait to move. Don't just listen to me, just go ahead and check for yourself how many units are available. Everyone has moved out.
