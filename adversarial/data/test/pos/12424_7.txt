First and foremost Andreoli's is an overpriced Italian grocery store.  As it is a grocery store, visitors should not expect table cloths or good service,   Many of the unusual items it carries can be found for less at nearby AJs, but not the broad selection of cheeses or salumi.  The homemade hot lunches can be very good, but this is not the place to bring the boss.  Because the food is homemade, it varies in consistency from day to day.  I will say, as one who lived in Italy for many years, the dishes are indeed authentic and worth a try, if not worth the price.  One warning: Don't order the pizza and expect an ordinary pizza.  It's a rustic pizza, made with bread dough.  We did not like it.  Andreoli himself, incidentally, can be quite grumpy to those he does not know.
