Impressed from the moment Mark Purdy and Joe Marsco first opened the doors to Andre's Bistro & Bar, the transition from a fine-dining stalwart inside the Monte Carlo to a casual French bistro in the former DW Bistro space originally marred only by music that was both too loud and out of place, a recent return for brunch with out of town guests has shown the restaurant to have only gotten better in the intervening months, a shake-up at Alize necessitating a split of Mark's time doing nothing to diminish the quality of a kitchen under the guidance of Marty Red DeLeon Lopez.\n\nNow approaching the four-month mark, early struggles to understand a new market ironing themselves out with time, Spring sees Andre's welcoming guests for both Lunch and Dinner on weekdays plus weekends at Brunch, a party of 4 met by Mr. Marsco soon after entering with seating quickly offered along a banquette suitable for six, the extra space needed as the decision was made to trust the kitchen carte blanche.\n\nOriginally decided upon based on two Southerners' desire for French food, their visits to both Bouchon and Bardot favorable on previous trips to Sin City, it was with pleasantries exchanged and Coffee from Las Vegas' own Vesta Roasters soon flowing that Chef Marty approached the tableside telling the group menus would not be necessary, \"I hope your brought an appetite\" never as ominous as it seems when it promises twenty different dishes coursed out over a total of just under two hours and twenty minutes.\n\nTold that Chefs Rochat and Purdy were frequently in and out, the recent hiring of Joshua Bianchi at the top of the Palms likely to see Purdy back on a more consistent basis soon, brunch at Andre's once again began with two treats from Chef Tammy Alana, the Beignets dusted in Powdered Sugar still every bit on par with the best of NOLA while the Pastry Basket yielded a far more crunchy Croissant than last time, the Almond version more like the Danish terms of consistency while the Peaches and Cream replicating sunny-side Eggs remains as fun as it is delicious.\n\nBoth starting and ending with Chef Alana's sweets, the bulk of the meal a steady flow of Rochat classics and several brunch favorites, round two was comprised of two rashers of sweet and smoky Bacon as well as the Escargots de Bourgongne plus Andre's ever impressive collection of housemade Pates and imported Meats and Cheese, the Bacon-wrapped Pate as chunky and funky as many served in France while the Bermuda Triangle, Cherry Moustarda and Rillettes all went well with a Warm Baguette, still one of the Las Vegas' most impressive complimentary Bread services.\n\nAttempting to take it easy on the Carbs, though the quality Butter and housemade Jams made such a thing more challenging than usual, a course most easily described as \"Eggs\" arrived next, both Andre's Classic Benedict and one with Smoked Salmon pitch-perfect beneath thick Hollandaise and soft-poached Yolks while the Brioche at the base of a Croque Madame was thinner than in the past and thus more typical to that served in France, a good thing for those who value authenticity as well as folks who which to save more room for the generous helping of buttery Breakfast Potatoes or Fries cooked crisp in Duck Fat.\n\nContinuing to put its name into the hat for Sin City's best Chicken & Waffles, the juxtaposition of soft Cornbread and crunchy Buttermilk Batter plus Country Gravy admittedly more Southern USA than South of France, those looking for something a bit less heavy would be well advised to check out Andre's Maine Lobster Roll served on toasted Bread with just a touch of Mayonnaise, the duo of Quiches also both well made with good Custard and a clean-edged Crust, the Vegetarian version a bit more balanced as the combination of Bacon and aged Comte in the Lorraine came across a little more salty than some might want.\n\nGetting full at this point, though happy to set aside any plans for weekend productivity in exchange for a truly grand finale followed by a parade of Desserts, it was alongside an Herb-Butter soaked Steak cooked Medium-Rare that two slices of Foie Gras and Nutella Brioche were served topped in Strawberries and Sauternes Glaze, the carnivorous more than happy to over-indulge while those fond of pastry thankfully held back a little bit, the Float, Sundae and Crème Brulee all quite good but difficult to gush over while the rich Pot de Crème, tangy Lemon Tart and elegant Walnut Pie with Chocolate and Caramel were all beyond reproach...and at $8 each a veritable steal for Desserts of such quality.\n\n*****Offering a menu at Brunch that can go toe-to-toe with names like Thomas Keller or Michael Mina, the prices generally discounted by at least 25% for comparable plates, Andre's Bistro & Bar has achieved in short-order what many restaurants strive a lifetime for in a city known for rushed openings and fast shutters, a destination spot in the neighborhood that is as impressive to tourists as it is a gift to locals.
