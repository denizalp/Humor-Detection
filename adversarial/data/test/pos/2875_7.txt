Came here via groupon...and I have to say, I like this place. It's clean and the rooms are relaxing. The red clay ball room is my favorite...I nestle myself in a bed of red clay balls and sweat away, then hit the ice room to wake up...then repeat the process.\n\nHad to remove a star because the food prices were a bit out of wack. Take the price of a Korean dish at any Korean restaurant in town and multiply the price by 1.5 or double. \n\nOverall a relaxing afternoon and a cool place to take a date and do something new.\n\nLater on had a great night sleep.
