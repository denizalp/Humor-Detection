I was looking forward to our meal.  I ordered ribs and chicken tenders. A baked potatoe and chili for the sides.\n\nTried a rib.. cold. Tried potatoe.... warm.  Chili did not melt the cheese.  I never complain. I did this time.  Everything was cold. Bad experience.  I the rolls were hot and fresh and good.  \n\nManager came over offered to order new meal... I just did not want to wait. \n\nNext time.......
