I just left here. Tonight is my 30th birthday and although the food was great, the service is what I have come to expect from Vegas, absolute shit.  Our server, \"one of their best\" didn't give a flying fuck about our table.  I don't need a candle or a birthday song, but embarrass my family and I will be compelled to call you out. The band was great too but our blonde server never smiled once and made my family, who tried so hard to give me a good time, feel like assholes..\n\nThanks and happy birthday to me!
