Today, I experienced the worst hair cut I have ever had. \n\n1. Yuko cut my sideburns without asking what I want and they look ugly!! The Hair Clipper isn't sharp at all and my sideburns look like unshaved for couple of days!! WTH!\n\n2. She didn't wash my hair after the haircut so there are short hair on my face and neck. She said if I want my hair washed she will charge me. This is the only haircut I have ever had without any wash after the cut. And she told me that the wind outside will blow the short hair away. LMAO!\n\nI have read all the previous reviews and I believed she is good. It turned out to be a terrible decision. I can't believe that u guys rated this hair salon five stars and I drove more than 10 mins from campus to get my hair cut that ugly.\n\nIf you are a young man and care about your hair style, don't let this 50-year-old Japanese madam cut your hair!
