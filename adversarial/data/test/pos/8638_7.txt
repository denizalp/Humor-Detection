YIKES! I would be perfectly fine with this place if it wasn't for the rudeness of the checkout witch. She yelled at me, interrupted me and ignored me. She would ask a question about what I ordered (well, yell a question) and then interrupt me to ask the same question to the counterperson. Really, don't ask me if you don't want my answer. She treated me like a criminal, like she thought I would lie about what I ordered to shave cents off what I pay. Damn.\n\nI could not wait to get the hell out of there. The bagels were pretty good but nothing warrants this kind of treatment.
