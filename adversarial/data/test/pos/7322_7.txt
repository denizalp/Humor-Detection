Today, i decided to stop by and check out the new Michael Kors store @ Hilldale.  Now, keep in mind that I have reviewed about Hilldale before and how bad it has become for men who shop, but I thought I would check it out anyway.  As I walked in, the store seemed very bright with not a huge selection.  I guess I was expecting more merchandise. But again to my disappointment, no men's clothes, or leather accessories.  The only have one or two men's watches.  The very flamboyant blond male sales associate told me that I could maybe check back around Christmas and they might have some men's things for the holidays.  The key word here is \"Might\".  So my overall rating with this one is poor!  Just another glowing example of how Hilldale is only catering to one sex!  WOMEN.  Pretty soon you will need a Vagina just to walk in the door!
