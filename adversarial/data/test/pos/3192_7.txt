Charlotte local here but I've been on two Charlotte NC Tours now. As a work teambuiliding exercise we took the uptown Segway tour. It was a blast and even though I've lived here many years I saw and learned a few new Charlotte secrets. We have a variety of ages in our office and everyone had a great time. \n\nThe manperson and I took the Bike n Brewery tour last night as part of CRVA's Stride and Ride event. We had an absolute blast traveling through Southend on our colorful cruisers and sampling some great Charlotte beer along the way. \n\nThe only recommendation I'd make is for the tour company to have an agreement with the breweries for at least a small sample of beer instead of having to buy at every stop. We were on a free tour so absolutely no complaints for that but I think if I'd paid full price I'd at least want a drink ticket or two. \n\nThanks guys for a great Saturday night!
