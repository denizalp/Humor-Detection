Whatever u do, make sure tony (the sushi \"chef\") does NOT make ur sushi!!! He totally messed up the uni ( I KNOW RIGHT? how can u mess up on uni?) he basically took out the plate of uni and instead of giving me the whole layer of the UNI piece, he literally kept cutting the uni into pieces and laying it ontop of the rice.. which basically turned the UNI into crumbled broken pieces. ON TOP OF THAT!!  He doesn't even know how to roll out the rice for the nigiri. NEW CHEF PLEASE!!!  not trying to be racial but, THIS IS WHY U DON'T GO TO SUSHI RESTAURANTS WHERE u have MEXICAN sushi chefs. HE SERIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING...I know it's all u can eat, but damn can u cut the fish any thinner?
