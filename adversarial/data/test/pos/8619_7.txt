C'est Bon, I wanted to like you, I really did but you had to go and break my heart ...\n\nThe food here really surprised me. But it wasn't the food that will prevent me from ever returning, its the recent experience.\n\nI have been here twice, the first time we had amazing service from a very nice guy, he was very friendly and talkative. That would have been my first visit and I found C'est Bon from their coupon in the entertainment book. Which was for a free entree, I made sure before ordering that if I ordered rice that it would not be the free entree as rice is just a side if you ask me. The waiter insured us that they will remove the middle entree, which sure enough they did. \n\nSo we decided to go back after a couple weeks and there was different people working, a woman who I assume may have been the owner and a guy. The woman seemed to be ignoring people and eventually just disappeared and left altogether.\n\nAnyway, we had another coupon, ordered the exact same food and when the bill came, the rice was the one that was removed.. \n\nThen we were told that's the way it is etc etc, basically he was trying to tell us that we were liars. That's a good way to keep customers from returning, the right thing would have been to fix it but he was very rude about the whole thing. Why be surprised when you don't get a tip is beyond me.\n\nBased on this experience, I don't care how amazing the food is or isn't , I will never go back.
