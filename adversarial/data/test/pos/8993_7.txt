yahoo! was I ever happy that we finally have HOBBY LOBBY ! My husband...not so happy since this means I will be shopping more. (sorry honey if you are reading) LOL I grew up with Hobby Lobby being raised in Oklahoma where the store originated. The checkout process needs some work as they never seem to have enough checkers. Of course where do they these days now that I am thinking about it? I am sure with time they are new it will all get better. I am just so glad to have them. I used to have to go home, shop and then try to find a way to ship my finds.I am giving them a 4 because 5 would to me mean excellent customer service but I doubt it would even be possible to get many 5s from me on that. Customer service sadly seems to be from a bygone era. If you go to their website and sign up they will send the sales.
