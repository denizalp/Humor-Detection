I bought a coupon for $59 to play at Orange Tree and Legend Trail a few months ago. I basically just bought it to play at Legend Trail and get the Orange Tree round as a bonus. \n\nFirst off, this course is a long drive away even from the Scottsdale Airpark area. I don't mind driving this far if the experience and or value makes up for it. This certainly wasn't the case at Legend Trail.\n\nThe driving range had minimal grass that hadn't been mowed in quite some time so it was basically like practicing out of thick rough and the balls are pretty seasoned. Then when I was practicing on the chipping green, a maintenance employee pulled the flags out that I was hitting at and started mowing right in front of me. I was a little annoyed but wasn't going to let it bother me much.\n\nPlaying my round, the course was in pretty bad shape. They probably had aerated a few weeks ago would be my guess so I can't really hold that against them.\n\nWhat did annoy me though was that I was having the same issues repeatedly with maintenance staff not showing any etiquette. I had multiple greens I was hitting into from 100 yards or less and the staff would not turn off their weed whackers while I was hitting. One guy on a hole was standing 5 feet from the flag and even saw I was trying to hit and he didn't even move! There were three weed whackers going around one green while I was putting too. On another hole, I was standing over the ball to tee off and three maintenance carts drove right past me. I have never felt like such an inconvenience to staff at a golf course. I wouldn't even expect that at a course like Orange Tree.\n\nNot sure what Shane S was referring to about management understanding customer service there. I went in the pro shop afterwards to ask for a manager and the employee informed me that he was gone for the day and asked why I needed one. When I told him I was upset about the maintenance staff, he sure couldn't have cared less. I filled out an online survey letting the course know about my experience and never heard back.\n\nAll in all, not worth the drive out there. If you want a nice golf course and don't mind spending money, go to Boulders or Grayhawk. If you want a nice course but are more price sensitive, then go to We Ko Pa. It's just as far away, almost the same price for residents, and a difference of night and day for course layout, amenities and customer service there.
