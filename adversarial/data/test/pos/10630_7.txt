Trader Joe's is one of those places that you either like or dislike intensely. This is one of my favorite TJ locations and it is both close to my car dealer and not to far from the house.\n\nNormally pop in here after getting my car serviced at Honda. I usually drive the back way and behind the dealership and use the traffic signal right on TJ's corner.\n\nEach store is set up a little differently and some are bigger than others. I'm always surprised at how many people are at this location shopping. Then again there are several other stores in the same parking lot which makes this a convenient visit.\n\nSome of our favorite items here are the Orange Chicken in the freezer section. The bagged freezed Dried Fruits are also a big time score and my Granddaughter definitely has most of the collection. Even picked up some Jackfruit on my last visit.\n\nThe one thing that makes TJ's a fun place to shop is the Pumpkin products celebration that they have during the fall season. I'm a fool for pumpkin and grabbed several of their 40+ items on my last adventure. Easy to make and very tasty.\n\nThe quality of their products here are better than most chain stores and the customer service is always friendly with a bit of pep. You may even hear the happy bell ring in the back ground.\n\nLook for their flyers that come out in the mail and get ready for some really cool specials. FEELING LIKE A FOOL!\n\n3.75 STARS
