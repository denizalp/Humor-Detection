I am a big fan of Zia Records.  A few years ago, I had a bunch of CD's stolen from me.  Long story, I don't want to get into it - quit pressuring me!  Okay... Sorry -   I didn't want to spend a ton of money to replace my collection.  So, I came to Zia Records to see what they had - I had a bunch of hard to find albums, so I wasn't expecting much.  But, to my complete joy, I found everything that I wanted and much more.  I became hooked.  Not only do they have a great selection of used albums, they have all the new stuff as well.  I then got hooked on DVD's - I have a problem; I know!  I ended up collecting all of the T.V. shows that I love and aren't on the air anymore.  And, when you think that there isn't anymore that you need, they have a vinyl section.  What??? I am a collector there as well.  And, if you get strapped on your cash flow - you can always sell your used stuff.  Not gonna' happen... I'll sell blood and other bodily fluids first.\n\nWith all of that said, here is my review from my last visit. The reason I checked in to Zia's was to find the 3rd season of Community.\n\n*Side Note:  Community is the best show on air right now!  Don't try to argue, just accept it as fact.\n\nAnyhow, I walked in and was given the \"hipster\" head nod while they had Foo Fighters blasting overhead.  Not a bad way to walk into a store.  I immediately got distracted by the sales bin at the front near the counter.  I decided to walk around and look at the other CD's they had going on... I ended up buying a couple of old punk CD's, that I once had.  THE GERMS - GERMACIDE and THE DESCENDANTS - MILO GOES TO COLLEGE.  Good stuff right there!  As I was walking to the counter to check out, I totally forgot about the reason I came in the first place.  So, I went to the DVD section and got my COMMUNITY DVD.  I paid full price but, since it's the best show on T.V. right now, it's well worth it.\n\nCheckout was easy and on the way out you can grab all of the free magazines they have by the door.  Plus, you can see what in-store appearances are coming up.  Good times!!!
