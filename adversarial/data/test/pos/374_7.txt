Caveat: I've reviewed the Signature MGM itself separately, but my experience with Jet Luxury could be considered distinct enough from the property that it seemed to warrant a separate, different review. \n\nI found Jet Luxury through the Yelp Talk thread recommendations for VRBO.com -  I was searching for a nice suite accommodation on the cheap for a girl's weekend in Vegas. Jet Luxury was responsive and affordable for the Signature at MGM accommodations. \n\nI originally e-mailed my condo inquiries (a short list of questions about availability, price quote, and whether they'd require a deposit). The prompt response I receive didn't answer all my questions, but encouraged me to call to reserve two rooms. I reserved two rooms - a 1 bedroom and a junior, requesting that they be connected (to form one large room). Making a reservation was friendly and efficient, I'd received my confirmation\/receipt within minutes of calling.\n\nNotes about reservations:\n- They do not require a deposit, however the room total is charged 3 days prior to your stay (and you must cancel 3 days prior to receive a full refund).\n- The confirmation and receipt are one and the same document. Having browsed other listings I knew generally that there was a SignatureMGM fee of $20 of day, plus taxes, and room cleaning charges. However, these additions aren't detailed on the receipt - your daily room rates are listed with a total.\n\nNotes during our stay:\n- Since Jet Luxury owns the condos separately, they also provide cleaning and housekeeping separately. Signature MGM could only provide check-in\/out and room service assistance. If you needed extra towels or something additional you'd have to call and catch the housekeeping staff when the were on site (starting at 11am daily). Not a huge hassle but when we realized we would need an extra blanket at 11pm we were SOL until the next day.\n- Our 1bdrm had a washer\/dryer in it, but no soap. We weren't staying long enough to bother, but if you do want to take advantage of the option, call in housekeeping to obtain it.\n- We were staying for three nights but the condo came with a day's supply of coffee. Oops!\n- Both the 1bdrm and studio units have pull-out queen sized beds. Jet provides basic bedding and a single blanket. With a full condo of girls and varying levels of temperature comfort we wished we'd realized the need for 1-2 extra blankets sooner!\n- Our 1brdm\/studio adjoining rooms were located in Tower 3, on the 3rd floor. Not sure where all their condos on the Signature MGM property is located but just an FYI as it makes a difference for some. (Tower 3 is the farthest from the MGM Grand proper, but the closest to the Harmon St. gates.) \n- The condo was fully stocked - toaster, blender, pots+pans, utensils, etc. It was great to be able to cook breakfast and not have to leave the condo before we really needed to (aka after dark). \n- They were really responsive while we stayed - allowing us to check in early AND late.\n\nOverall, Jet Luxury made planning my 8-girl Vegas trip stress-free. I'd be more than happy to book through them on a return to Vegas or any other location they serve.
