Came here for restaurant week and it's hard to get to with construction going on and all the one way streets.  You really have to know downtown Phx to get to the valet or public parking.  \n\nOnce we got to the Palomar Hotel to the 2nd floor to the Blue Hound Kitchen it was very nice.  The ambience really has a cool vibe and a very urban feeling.  I checked out the website and the pictures do not do it justice.  \n\nWe had drinks at the side bar and the waitress was very attentive to the point we had to tell her we are meeting another couple, we are going to chat THEN we will sit down at our table.  Granted it was restaurant week but it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be.  Anyhow, we finally sit and peruse the menu.  It looked amazing so we decide instead of ordering the set restaurant week menu we would order the appetizers and try them out.  They were intriguing to us.  We order a fabulous bottle of Petite Syrah for only $40 bucks.....\n\n2 hours later we tried pretty much tried all the appetizers and they were delicious.  Great flavors, the corn appetizer you have to cut yourself off the cob.  Corn cutting of the cob skills needed!  It was fun and filling.  We did manage to order the beef short ribs and 3 out 4 thought they were fabulous.  Our 4th person thought it had way too much fat for what you are paying...30+.  He did think the flavor and taste was great! \n\nOur waiter was pretty good.  He was attentive for certain things but we sat with empty and near empty water glasses for awhile. All in all it was a great experience...little things like the bar waitress being too attentive I guess makes up for our waiter not being as attentive with certain things.\n\nWould I go here again?  Yes!
