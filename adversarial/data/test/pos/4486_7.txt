MPM used deplorable tactics to retain 95% of our security deposit. This sort of behavior can only be described as predatory. When we came to see the town house prior to move-in, simply put, it was trashed. The tenants did little to keep the home clean and uncluttered. On the move-in day you could see half of the furniture and junk the prior tenants left were sitting on the curbside waiting to be picked up. MPM had redone the carpets in the entire 3br house, repainted the walls, fixed all the doors, and a host of other improvements. They'll never admit to it, but the likely reason our deposit was withheld was so that MPM could recoup the resources they put in the house to make it presentable. I have also heard similar stories from friends, and other acquaintances. This was roughly three years ago, and I'm still bitter about it enough to write this scathing Yelp review.
