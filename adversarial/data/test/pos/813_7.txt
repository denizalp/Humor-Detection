Their summer movie sessions are awesome. I've been attending the past two years and I enjoy it. My little one loves it so it's a must every summer. They don't start showing until sundown which is around 8ish and they have the misters going to keep you cool during those hot summer nights. There's the playground and put out blocks and an oversized connect four game out to keep the little ones busy. I would recommend getting there early to reserve an a good spot and beware you will have to pay for parking unless you can park in the hotels near by. \n\nBIG DOWNSIDE: you can't bring outside food and they only have 4 restaurants in there which two aren't really kid friendly and you can only eat tacos and bbq so many times so if you can sneak in small snacks and drinks, all the better but you can't bring in coolers or any outside food.
