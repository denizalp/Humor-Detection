Do yourself a favor and eat here for every meal for the rest of your life. Seriously. Weed theme, employees are the chillest to ever live (I wonder why), Kool-Aid on tap and sandwiches that will make you wonder what universe you are in. When I become a billionaire, I am going to open one of these in my bedroom so I can watch Terminator 1 and pig out all day every day on the top bunk of my pure gold plated bunk bed. To be totally honest, I'm kinda pissed I'm not eating there right now....
