I know it was after lunch on a Sunday, but I was totally not impressed with this place.  You have to know something is wrong when everyone is sitting at the bar and stares at you while you walk in.  No one greeted us and we figured right then and there not a good place for lunch.  Bad service is sooo not cool.
