A group of friends and I have a food club, where we get together every two weeks and take turns picking new restaurants to try. Being a huge Indian food fan, I was ecstatic to hear that someone had finally picked an Indian restaurant.\n\nThe service we received was great. My friend had informed the owner what it was we were doing, and he was more than accommodating. He sat down with us and we were able to talk to him about the restaurant which is really nice. \n\nThe food, however, was so disappointing. Two of us split the Indian sampler, as it was advertised that it was \"Perfect for two to share or one to feast on.\" Naturally, I was expecting a bunch of food. To my disappoint, when the platter came out - it was nothing more than barely a half cup of each item. It was not enough to satisfy one persons' hunger, let alone enough for two to share. We had even ordered an extra side of naan. It was sad to say, we had more naan than food to eat it with. It's a sad, sad day when that happens. \n\nI will say, their mango lassi was good.\n\nA majority of my group was disappointed, just as I was, in the food to price proportions. Although, many of them left full, unlike myself - the price they paid for the food wasn't sitting too well with them. But who can blame em? My friend and I spent about 40 dollars between the two of us, to leave the place completely dissatisfied and hungry. \n\nNeedless to say, when we left the restaurant, the first place I headed to was the Jack in the Box in the same parking lot.
