I don't use Yelp unless the business in question has earned five stars, and Bell Honda has done that for me.  I'm pretty picky!  But I saw a few of the bad reviews on here, and I am just not sure where these came from.  I wanted to share a little about my experience to help my neighbors who might be trying to choose between Honda lots in the valley.  I have bought two Hondas from Bell, and this past experience was top notch.  They have definitely fine-tuned the operations and approach at this location.    \n\nThe customer service at this place is stellar ... from the minute you walk on the lot until you are driving off in the car you wanted.  My salesman was Joey and he is excellent at what he does.  He was young and hip, yet still so professional, experienced, and knowledgeable about the product.  I did not feel like I was talking to a slimeball ... not the stereotypical car salesman, more like a college buddy or friendly neighbor.  I felt very comfortable negotiating with him, and in the end I felt like we all got a pretty fair deal, and we were all smiling.  I do want to note that during the process I had several members of management come up and offer assistance, answer questions, etc.  \n\nThe real magic happened in finance; even though it was a Saturday, they were able to seal the deal and get me some excellent final numbers.  I signed papers with Jamie, and he is also a great representative of the brand.  I think he said he gets paperwork (the dreaded part) done in record time so you don't feel like your whole Saturday is wasted just picking up a new car.  I was actually done before the car was finished being detailed, and they got me an interest rate and payment that was significantly lower than I had before.  If you get this far in the process, ask about getting \"tier-bumped\" (which means they bump your credit up to the next tier based on car payment history) and ask about smart-note financing (where they split the payment for you and a larger amount goes to principal).\n\nNeedless to say, I will be back to this location next time I am looking for a change, and I will also be referring friends and family anytime I hear someone is looking.  If you have any questions on this post, please feel free to send me a message.  I am happy to pay it forward.
