The woman and I were driving back from Mercury at 0130hrs on a Friday. We see the open sign, and we decide to go in. I almost contemplate an expensive ($13.50) bowl of ramen, but instead I elect for some rolls with the woman. A guy proficiently took our order, and to my delight, they had Asahi. \n\nGET THIS: DOMESTIC BOTTLES $3.95, IMPORT BOTTLES $4.25. By FAR the cheapest I have ever seen in this city. I was losing it, so I decided to sing \"Take on Me\" on the Karaoke. Epic fail, but the guy in the kitchin was lovin' it. The server (fit the profile of an owner) said the place opened in June 2009, he's open until 0000hrs M-THU and 0100 Sat and Sun, but that \"if there's a large party..(like the 20 Catonese speaking people drinking wine, singing karaoke, and playing cards) I may as well stay open\". This is an awesome business ethic that's rare to see in this city.\n\nThe rolls wern't EPIC like Towa, but they were very good for their price. We got 4 rolls and 2 beers for $28 tax in, plus tip. Excellent post-night-out-snack.\n\nInstead of going for a wing night, I'll come here with a friend to get some sushi, enjoy several drinks, and just talk. Awesome awesome place.
