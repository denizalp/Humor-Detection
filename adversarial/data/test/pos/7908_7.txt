Gordon, you've done it again.\nThis was the absolute best birthday dinner a girl could have asked for.\n\nWe arrived about 4:15pm on a Saturday, without a reservation.  Oops!  My mistake, I was supposed to call and make one, but didn't.  Luckily, my friends and I were not in a hurry.  It was my birthday dinner, and a thank you to my friend who does our taxes, so none of us had anywhere to be for a long time.  \nWe stood in line to check in for about 6 minutes, before I noticed the sign that said \"check in with hostess first.\"  \nAnother oops on my behalf.  I shouldn't go places when I'm tired. \n\nSo, the hostess checked me in, and said that they would send a text message to me when the table was ready, and let me know it would be probably an hour.  Awesome!  We don't have to stand in line the whole time. \n\nSo we head over to the Heart Bar...which ended up being a not so awesome experience, but I'll save that for their review.  anyway, I got a text message about 20 minutes later saying that our table was ready!    \n\nWe were seated, and our server came over, and introduced herself, and showed us how to use the iPad menus.  We each got a cocktail, (and one beer for my non cocktail friend)...they were all delicious!!  Mine was the best though (to me anyway), I had the skinny screw.  I need to go back JUST for one of these.  \n\nA note about our server...I wish I remember her name, I think it was Nicole?  (pretty blonde girl)...She was a darling.  So nice, very accommodating, and extremely friendly.   She even wrote happy birthday on our check!\n\nAppetizers: Jalapeno Poppers:  We had these served with the ranch on the side, since my fella is completely anti-ranch.  They were spicy and delicious!!!  I was so happy with these, and I don't really care for spicy food.  \nOnion Rings:  omg nom.  I love onion rings and these were perfect.  \n\nBurgers:  My fella and I had the farm burger, and the uber cheese burger, with duck bacon added to mine for $3 extra.  Totally worth it.  They were both amazing...the burger was a perfect mid-rare, the egg oozed out with yummy yolk, and my uber cheese burger was SO delicious!  The goat's cheese was my favorite.  So creamy and delightful!  \nI don't remember what the other 2 at the table had, I was too engrossed in my food.\n\nTruffle fries:  Wow!  So delicious!\n\nDessert: Sticky toffee pudding push pops:\nWowza!  While I will admit, I liked the pudding at the steak house better, you have to hand it to Gordon for not being a one-trick pony.  Changing up his classic dessert and layering it in a push pop was delicious, and had a feeling of whimsical child-like fun to it.  I loved it!\n\nThe crowning moment of this visit though, was that because it was my birthday, Christina (from Hell's Kitchen) who is the new executive chef, came over with our food to say hello, take a quick picture, and chat with me.  In fact...she mentioned that Gordon was going to be in town, and even checked her phone to find out what time!!  She was gracious, and amazing, and dealt with my star-struck silliness beautifully.  (I NEVER get star struck, but I was like a giddy school girl.)\n\nAll in all, the dining experience was incredible.  I can't wait to go back again!  Maybe I'll meet Gordon next time. ;)  \n\nMr. Ramsay, you've got a perfect trio here in Vegas.  Amazing job.
