We chose Frasher's as runner up after we had a failed attempt trying to go to Little Miss (that place is ALWAYS so dang packed!)\n\nAnother AZ BBQ experience in which we realized we are no longer in Tennessee anymore.\n\nMeat was okay.. not the best, but certainly not the worse we've had. The sides though. God bless those sides...\n\nI ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese tasted fine, but it was extremely runny and soupy. No thickness to it at all.\n\nMy poor fiance ordered their mashed potatoes as a side to the three meat platter. When the plate came out, we thought the mashed potatoes were grits (see attached photo). In addition to their watered down appearance, they were pretty bland and ended up forming a solid mass by the end of our lunch -  we were a bit disappointed. The bbq sauce was okay, but tasted like it came out of a huge tub.\n\nMy recommendations: \nIn addition to improving the side items, I would highly recommend sweet tea be served, an absolute staple paired with BBQ. We were baffled as to why they were serving some sort of tropical kiwi\/watermelon tea by the soda machine at a bbq place.
