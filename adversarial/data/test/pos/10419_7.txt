This place is my best friend favorite place.. I was kind of ehhhh about it because I know where good vietnamese food is at. Haha. Anyways good vegetarian options for me. Yes. Score. Very helpful and very accommodating. \n\nTheir vegetarian vermicelli was wonderful but next time I have to tell them easy on the garlic. Overall everything went smoothly :)
