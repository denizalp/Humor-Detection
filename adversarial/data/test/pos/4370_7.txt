Been living here now for about 7 months, I was going to review it sooner but I wanted to give it a fair review. I will start with my actual unit. I LOVE my loft. The Wolf appliances and design of the unit is great. We furnished our own washer and dryer as if you get the one management provides it's a cheap connected stackable that washes 2 pairs of jeans if your lucky - not too happy about that especially when paying $1350 a month for an apartment. When moving into the unit be prepared to clean your unit. Whoever they have preparing the units doesn't do the best job i.e. floors will need mopped possibly steamed cleaned, will need to wipe down doors and windows cabinets etc. I consider these little things but when commanding the rental rates they do you would think it would be done right. Maintenance here has been the biggest issue for us and seems to be the common problem when talking to my neighbors. We submitted a work order for our blinds and no one bothered to come even a week later. We eventually fixed it ourselves. The people working in the office are great and are available for questions. Overall it has been a great experience and we will be renewing our lease. Would have given a higher star rating but I think the maintenance issue needs to be addressed.
