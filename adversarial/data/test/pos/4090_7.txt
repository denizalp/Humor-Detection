What a refreshing alternative to Charlie's. So tired of Charlie's \"Drag Extravaganza\" which seems like a common event (wasn't it once a macho Country Western bar?--see my review of Charlie's). \n\nNu Towne is simple bar with a feeling of a warm inviting \"Cheers\" type place. I mean where on God's green earth does a macho bartender introduce himself when you approach the bar to buy a beer?!!\n\nThe decor, although dated, is wonderfully nostalgic. The music, one of the best parts, is both old-school (who plays The Beach Boys?!), and new catchy songs. The clientele is a mix of young-ish, middle age, and mature--all friendly, no-attitude, and inviting. Met the nicest duo (friends\/biz partners). I can't remember the last time strangers invited me for a drink and were so down-to-earth. \n\nSuggestions: close the damn doors. I \"get\" the inviting look of open doors at places of biz, but it was too cold unless one sat in the middle of the place. I don't get why all bars do this. \n\nOtherwise, I'm a huge fan. Goodbye Charlie's; those of us who loathe drag shows will \"walk on by\" (I'd bet Nu Towne places Dion Warwick every now and then).
