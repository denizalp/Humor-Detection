Virginia, the manager was simply not a nice person, kept watching us the whole time we unloaded our truck to move our stuff into storage and did the same thing when we moved our stuffed out.  If she wasn't busy, she could've at least helped unpack a few boxes, lol.  Kept telling us we needed to hurry and move our moving truck so someone else could park there.  Like we wanted to take our time or something.
