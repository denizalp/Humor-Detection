How simple can it be to review a place called Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers?\n\nWell, pretty easy because they do a great job with cold beer and cheeseburgers!  LOL\n\nWe've been here a few times and have enjoy the buzz and food. Unlike some of the brew type places in the valley trying to serve pub grub, this place figured out that serving interesting good tasting food is what makes us keep coming back.  Wow, how simple can that be?\n\nThe pretzels are warm and tasty. The shredded Buffalo Chicken dip (photo) has some kick and hits the stop. The Sirlon Sliders are really very, very good.  They may not be as good as Gordon Ramsey's BurGR place, but we'll keep coming back here again and again for the Sliders. \n\nWhat's that's saying about giving people what they want...  simple right?\n\nHappy Hour runs until 7 pm and there's a monthly beer special. At the moment it's Dos Equis. They also have a $5.00 Off Yelp Checkin deal (photo), so don't forget to checkin. Expect to pay $20+ each depending how thirsty your group is. LOL\n\nEnjoy!
