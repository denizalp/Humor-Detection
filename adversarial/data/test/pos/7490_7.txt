Went for late night, kitchen was still open at 11. Nice.\n\nFood was ok, they were serving burgers and appetizers at that point. Fine by me. Nothing outstanding but no low points. Menu was trying really hard to be frisky, kind of like when your boring aunt makes a push to become the cool aunt.\n\nThe decor is so contrived and lame. This is the kind of restaurant that gets made fun of back in Seattle. It looks like they went into the sysco food systems catalog, opened to the chapter titled \"trendy 5 years ago\" and checked every item on the list. \"Free Idea: Decorate a restaurant with Edison bulbs?\" -Jesse Thorn (@JesseThorn) \n\nIt's fine, just not especially good.
