What a blast! Thunder from Down Under is the perfect start to a Girl's Night Out! Seriously, don't miss it. I wish I had gone sooner.\n\nI don't want to give away too much detail about the show but I will say that it's pure fun. They're extremely interactive and engaging - lots of table dancing aka getting up close and personal with the dancers and crowd contests. \n\nHere are a couple noteworthy tidbits to know:\n- I'd suggest buying the cheapest tickets available because you'll more than likely end up being moved to a better spot in the center of the crowd which is what happened to me and it was FABULOUS!\n- This is an 18+ year old show - yes, gotta corrupt them at their prime (jk!)\n- Wear heels, wear shorts, wear flip-flops, it doesn't matter, just be sure to wear a smile and have fun!\n- Um, boyfriend, fiance, husband...who?
