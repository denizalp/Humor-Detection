Bowled and ate well at Notre Dame des Quilles today with Janine T, thanks to a tip from savvy Amy T. Thanks ladies! This newish, dim,  peaceful dive bar has free old-timey bowling and a simple menu of fine diner casse croute food. \n\nWe tasted the macaroni and cheese with squash and a jalapeno chutney  - delicious. Comes with a big fist of salad de chou. Another immediately please. Also liked the breakfast for dinner, and the hot buttery biscuit with clearly homemade gravy. Friends walked in unexpectedly (but of course) and spotted whiskey and real ginger ale on the menu. Good food and drinks, $4 pints from 3-8pm I believe, and the bowling! I like the small two lanes facing the cook, framed by the big window. I like setting up my own pins, writing things down to keep track - I don't always need a robot to do that stuff. I don't mind that at this point is nearly barebones, the ceiling is dripping, or that the waitress has to climb on a chair periodically to switch up the playlist. She mixed in nearly half of Midnight Marauders while we were there. Fact: that is awesome. I hope NDQ will remain this delicious and realistically working class, because in those respects so far it's all five stars.\n\nCash only.
