Fail to understand the Yelp hype here. Very standard north Indian restaurant. Solid, and in the top half of that category, but not 5 star by any stretch. Only a couple of Nepalese dishes. Vegetable chow chow was kind of lame, just a few chopped peppers and onions. \n\nThere are too many Indian restaurants bringing the same menu and they all blend together. India is a huge country (especially when you're including neighboring countries like Nepal), and it has a vast variety of cuisines and styles. Somebody please bring something more adventurous than saag paneer and chicken tikka masala.
