Cupcrazed Cakery is just ok.  One weekend the family and I decided to take a trip out to Cupcrazed, especially since they won Cupcake Wars a few years back. They are located in Baxter Village, which in itself the Village has a nice hometown, but shopping feel to it at the same time.  It is almost set up as if you were on vacation somewhere and  just checking out the local stores in close proximity.  Nice touch!\n\nOk, now onto the cupcakes, we got a total of 5 different ones(Red Velvet, Blue Raspberry, Birthday Cake, Double Chocolate and White Chocolate Mocha Frappuccino).  They were out of all the other flavors they had listed, maybe because we got there at around 5pm on a Saturday.  The best one was the White Chocolate Frappuccino, it had a bold and distinct coffee flavor but not overpowering.  It was awesome...I probably could have eaten a couple more of those.  The others were good but not outstanding, they tasted like average cupcakes.  The cupcakes didn't seem stale but didn't seem like they were baked that day either.  I don't know if it had anything to do with them being in the refrigerator or not but they weren't as moist and fluffy as I had expected them to be.  \n\nThe decor\/setup inside is a little crammed.  We were practically sitting on top of the garbage can.  Ok that's stretching it some but we were very close to it and the cooler to grab a beverage if you wanted it.  Every time someone came to get a drink we had to move so that they can open the door.\n\nThey were having a special that Saturday so all cupcakes were $2.  Hey, it's always a nice surprise to pay less then what you were expecting.  It was a nice treat for the evening and maybe I will go again and try some other flavors but I am not going to purposely go out of my way to make a trip there.
