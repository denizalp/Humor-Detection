Listen: they are a little further down the road in Las Vegas from the Rental Center. There is always something wrong with the car. And it all seems vaguely cheesy; like somebody \"borrowed\" these cars and now you can rent them.\n\nBut for the price of a sub-compact at Xxxx (rhymes with \"mAvis\") I got a Volvo. And for the price of a standard from Xxxxxxx  (rhymes with \"Rational\") I got a Dodge Charger. A little more got me a little Mercedes.\n\nSeriously, I don't know how they do it and I don't quite trust them. I've rented 3 times and it's worked out. Had to return the Charger 'cause a headlight was out and the coolant light kept coming on in the Volvo. But hell: it don't cost much.\n\nIf you are counting on getting the car you reserved, think again. But you will get a cool car at a good price.
