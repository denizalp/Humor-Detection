I am seriously so proud of this place, they have really got their sh*t together now. I remember coming here years ago and thinkin \"I will never come back\"... But with the latin clubs in town are so scarce I decided to give it another try.\n\nI am now a HUGE fan of this place. Went on a Saturday night, this place gets crackin around 11:30, but get there early so that you can get a nice-FREE- table to sit at. It is a very spacious area. They even have a stage for live bands. The dance floor is decent but if I had to complain it would be that the dance floor itself had some cracks and holes in it, which is not good when you have 3 to 4 inch heels ;b\n\nThe music played: Reggaton, salsa, cumbia, merengue, bachata, old school, new school, YOU name it. The crowd is mixed- older to young. The drinks are not that expensive. Sunday nights is BANDA- yeahhhhhh buddy!!
