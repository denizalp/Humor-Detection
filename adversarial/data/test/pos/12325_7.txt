I went to try it with my boyfriend after work and it's really terrible! We picked mild curry but when we ate it, it was so spicy. Plus the weird thing is when you order curry they do not come with rice, you need to add 1 buck to get the rice. That just does not make any sense to me at all. Can you find a person just eat curry for dinner without rice or noodles? The interior is nothing special at all. We feel we got ripped off. And when we are home we drink a lot of water and eat some ice cream cause we feel our throat is burning so badly.
