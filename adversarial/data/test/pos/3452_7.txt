I finally had my first experience at Mon Ami Gabi after learning that Burgr had a 2.5 hour wait at dinner that evening. While all the food we had was good, it wasn't great. It was decent. We opened with a couple of french onion soups which were served in deep large cups which I kind of wasn't too excited about. I like having a lot of cheese and bread, but the soup itself was tasty anyway.\n\nFollowing that, we had a huge seafood platter which included some very tender shrimp, mediocre oysters, a good amount of lobster, and some salmon ceviche. Not much to criticize, but nothing too amazing either. In particular, the oysters were not very good and lacked a good mignonette to help with the flavor. The lobster also had nothing to eat it with but was more enjoyable when we got some clarified butter. Finally, we had a chicken dish which was solid.\n\nFollowing that, we had a banana fosters dessert with ice cream that was very good. The sauce was delicious but the crepe's texture wasn't particularly great.\n\nService was attentive, bordering on too attentive and annoying. Our server came back a ridiculous number of times to ask us if we need anything, which we basically never did. It's good to have an attentive server but it is certainly uncomfortable when you almost have to ask them to come back less! I do regret not getting one of the steaks, having heard about them a lot. I'll have to come back for some steak frites someday.
