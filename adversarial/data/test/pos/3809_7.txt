So yeah the gelato is good.\n\nBut $8.00 for a CHILD SIZE small ass scoop good? Hell to the NO. \n\nHowever...the irony here is that while all the reviews here read the same about ridiculously exhorbitant prices, let's face it. When you are out randomly walking around in the Forum Shops at Caesars and spot sparkly shiny gelato winking at you....you are not going to think to check Yelp. Or you might, but I would venture to say most won't.\n\nSo unfortunately, in a spur of the moment kind of purchase like this, all the 1 and 2 stars in the world on this place won't save a line of 20 people paying $8.00 for gelato. It didn't work for me...and yes there was a line.\n\nRandom note to those planning to check out Vegas... remember to check the price of something first, before you let your visual sweet tooth steer you into a ridiculously expensive treat. Or just walk away when they say 'eight bucks please'.
