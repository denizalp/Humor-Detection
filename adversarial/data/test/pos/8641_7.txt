What this place does, they do very well! Perhaps I should say he does well. I've been in a few times and each time it's a friendly Italian man. The place is authentic. Like a little piece of Italy. The espresso has a bold and smooth flavor and in just a few ounces - like an espresso in much of Europe. The Gelato is the big feature though. It is so creamy and smooth. It has become my go to cold refreshment.
