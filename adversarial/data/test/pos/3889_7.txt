Arnold Palmer, why do you hate me? \n\nWhy do you intentionally place thousands of sand bunkers all over your courses?\n\nWhy do you always make my ball land above the hole and laugh at me when my putt races 12 feet past the hole on my putts for double bogey?\n\nWhy do you take my best drive of the day land in a waste area?\n\nWhy do you allow my perfect approach shot to slide off the back of the green and into a bunker?\n\nFrustrating day? not so much as this course is beautiful and kept in perfect condition. Who cares if I shot triple digits, I'd come back here in a heartbeat!
