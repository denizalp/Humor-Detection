I always wonder how this place has stayed in business so long. Greg must be loaded and just do this for the passion of it. Last time I came in here the man working gladly helped me find what I needed and ordered what I wanted. He even had them waiting for me when I went in again. \n\nHe was also really knowledgeable on his stuff. He wasn't some breathy creepy neckbeard working in a comic shop. As a girl I'm usually terrified to take the adventure into one of these lion dens to pick up what I want because it can be pretty scary. He was simply a nice old man. \n\nI'll continue to come here for all of my comic book needs :}
