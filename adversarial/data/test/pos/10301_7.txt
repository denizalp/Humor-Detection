For a $5 pizza you tend to not have very high expectations...  Even an outstanding $5 pizza is still exactly what it is... But a Cold $5 pizza can only be considered garbage. To add insult to injury it was actually ordered in-house. Yup! Actually waited for our pizza to cook and get cold sitting right there on the counter! \n\nLike I said you tend to have lowered expectations, but you incompetent order takers (Denise and Taylor) can't even do 1 thing right! ((In my teaching a 3 yr old voice now--------\"So in the future if a customer comes thru the doors... ie: a person that doesn't work with you, say hello, be polite, take the order, process the payment, when there food is done... give It to them!\" Your food is crap, we expect that... your service shouldn't also be!
