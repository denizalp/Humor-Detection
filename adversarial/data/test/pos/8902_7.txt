Well this visit was kind of interesting......\nThe food is good, the menu has changed some, but the service still has a lot to be desired.  \n\nThe waiter brought us drinks pretty fast but then you had to flag him down to ask for a refill.  After I asked for a refill, he said ok and then forgot for a bit, then realized he didn't bring me a refill and got it.\n\nThe food took a while to come out and then again he never came back to check on our drinks and we needed to flag him down to get a box and the bill.  After we asked for a box and the bill, he brought the box and then went over to the bar and started talking with the Bartendar while we sat and waited for the bill. He finally went and got the bill and brought it.  The time he spent at the bar until we got the check was not excessively long, but you felt like you were not the priority.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the spring roll appetizer and even though it was good, it was not worth almost $14 for that dish and is something I will not order again.  Everything else was priced reasonably.\n\nThis is a good place and we will go back, it's just hit and miss with the service.
