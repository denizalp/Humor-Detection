This place is so old school I felt young again!  I only went for snacks and a couple of beers at the bar but I want to go back, if only to hang out and watch the pros in action.\n\nI met a colleague as we're checking out Barberian's cellar (which is AMAZING) for an event next month.  I'm from out of town and once I walked in I wanted to stay at least for a bit.\n\nI saw the Steamwhistle truck around Vancouver all summer so figured I'd have a pint of that to start.  I was ready for a snack so we ordered a couple of shrimp cocktails.  Four massive prawns came out on a plate with a spicy cocktail sauce.  It was like being back in the '80s only better.  MASSIVE PRAWNS!!!  We also got a dish of their marinated pickles which consisted of cauliflower, carrots, beans and yeah, pickles.  Crunchy zesty goodness.  Next up was some pat√©.  I was told by my buddy that they make this stuff in-house.  Holy artery clogging deliciousness Batman!  This was so smooth and beautifully flavoured I was seriously considering planting my face right into the plate.  Throw in some gently garlic-ed, warm crusty bread and it was like a time warp into another era when life was less complicated.\n\nMike was the name of the burly, smiling bartender.  I met the sommelier, a petite woman, Christine, who is breaking through this traditional bastion of manliness.  Kudos to her!  I also met the owner, Arrron, who'd been greeting people and working the room with a warm smile.  He had one of those sincere handshakes that uses both hands.\n\nSerously if I lived in Toronto this would be my preferred place to relax after work with a couple of pals while being entertained by the super-cool staff.  Nice!
