Wonderful place to get seafood for lunch! The place has a small fish market in the back and table and chairs in the front. They have a large selection of fish sandwiches and other seafood items. I chose the fish tacos with swordfish, tuna, and salmon. They were delicious! I especially liked the salmon. I also tried their sushi roll of the day. Again, very delicious and fresh. It had shrimp tempura on the inside and a grilled piece of salmon on top. Their soups are freshly made. I came at a time when their soups were almost sold out and the one they had left was the spicy seafood gumbo. It was still very delicious, flavorful, and filling. This is definitely one of my favorite spots in the Strip\n\nApparently they have unlimited fish tacos for $8.99 on Tuesdays. Only found out about this after I left Pittsburgh. D:
