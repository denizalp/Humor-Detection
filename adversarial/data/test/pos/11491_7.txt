Honey, you need no boo at Nobu... as you will fall in love with the food and experience! I had a girls night with my mom before seeing Rod Stewart (he was adorable) and we had no clue what to get! Our wonderful waiter gave great advice and now I shall share it with you. We started with the yellowtail and jalape√±o sashimi appetizer. It was \"like buttah\"! A mild taste with appropriate sweetness, savory and 'kickiness' (I'm inventing words today). We then had the crispy rice with tuna... we would have had five more orders if we weren't pretending to hang with the Jones peeps. Next we had the crab tacos. Save your money here... two bites of deliciousness, but I wanted about four. Then it happened... the miso black cod came to the table. I managed my foodgasm moaning sounds so as to not get my mother and I kicked out of the restaurant. We succeeded, but it was hard. The fish was tender with a crispy skin. The combination of miso and saki worked magically together. This signature recipe is online! But apparently you need a brick oven to make it... off to buy bricks I go! Not really... I'll just come back again. We closed with the crab tempura. While it was delicious, I won't get it again. How could anything compare to the miso cod?! I left with a happy, full belly and will definitely be back. Now to work those extra shifts I need to afford this meal! But totally worth it! Thanks Nobu! Ps. Let the waitstaff know if you are seeing a show so they can speed up your order... but go with enough time to spare so you can enjoy a drawn out foodie experience and the company you came with.
