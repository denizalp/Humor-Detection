Place sucks.  Holy effing 5h1tballs the aisles are narrow, the fish counter staff seething and not wanting to be there, except for one helpful lad.  Too much overcrowding of different product lines.  Even the bakery did not turn my crank and I am a carboholic. Vegetables were expensive and atrocious.  Green peppers with brown specks and shriveled still on shelf for sale.  Our usual T&T at Warden and Steeles is 10,000 times better than this overpriced and overrated dump.  We passed an open-air farmers market on Yonge near Weldrick which saved the day!
