I did not like this kennel to be honest. The front staff are never  very friendly when Ive taken my dogs here, always copping a bit of an attitude. The last time we came my one dog was a little fearful and barked and then came to me and cowered so the desk lady asked the owner, that was on her way out the door, if they could even take him. I found that very odd since he had been there before and had no aggression issues, he was just upset. He didn't growl or bare teeth he only barked. She said no because he wouldn't come to her and they turned us away. I just found it odd, I mean he did bark but didn't show aggression (teeth, growl) and of course hes not going to come right to a stranger and kiss your face... I just found it quite unprofessional. \nOne time we even had them groomed for when we picked them up after a few nights stay and their nails were still pretty long where i had to look very closely to see if they even had been trimmed, and it was quite pricey for just taking a skiff off of the nails and nothing more (well nothing more that i could tell anyways).\nAnother time we took our fur kids here we picked them up and they said they had to carry my chihuahua around the whole time because she was fearful. Well let me tell you this chi is not fearful whatsoever. She may be only 5 lbs but shes the boss of our 65 lb husky\/lab cross and feels no two ways about it! If you offer to carry her around ... well she can spot a sucker a mile away! lol! i have no idea why that would have happened, at the dog park she plays with bigger dogs and she has our big doofus to boss around all day every day so if shes in a room full of dogs her size there is no way she would be fearful.\nAll in all, not a place i will take my fur kids again.
