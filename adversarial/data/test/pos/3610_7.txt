Looking for specific ceramic mugs for an artsy Christmas gift, instead found a few Christmas gifts for my niece & nephew.  Very helpful employees throughout the store, however when we got there, we were solicited by a girl selling candy.  Then, they only had two cashiers & a line that backed up to who knows where.  Short staffed for the holidays, but fully staffed w\/ help throughout the store?  Mom & I put our stuff back & left.  $15-20 worth of stuff for a 20 minimum wait, no thanks.
