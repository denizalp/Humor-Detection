do i even need to review this place?  everyone is giving it 5 stars (as i have).  hubert keller makes the best french food i have ever had in my life.  this place is one of the best culinary treasures in las vegas.  i have yet to visit the sf location, but when i'm in vegas, i always come here.  the only down side of french food for me is the fact that it's sooo creammmmy i feal like barfing afterwards... but it's worth it to sample kellers masterpieces!
