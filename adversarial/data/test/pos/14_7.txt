(Lyrics - Bee Gees - You Should Be Dancing)\n\nYo BoBites eats in Phoenix\nGoes right on to Scottsdale\nMy review takes me higher\nMy review keeps me Elite\n\nWhat you doin' for Restaurant Week....aah!\nWhat you doin' for Restaurant Week....aah!\nYou should try Drexyl, yeah!\nDrexyl, yeah!\n\n\nI came with a bunch of friends for Restaurant Week.  My favorite week of the years!  \n\nAt first sight the restaurant itself is very beautiful and elegant.  I love the bright greens and marble around the restaurant giving it a museum and delicate feel.  \n\nWe started with a bottle of wine and went in for the menu.  For Restaurant Week it was a 3 course meal.  So I started with the Beet Salad; roasted beets, baby carrots, petite greens and drizzled with a honey citrus vinaigrette and sweet jalapenos.  It was light start and honey citrus with jalapeno was different and gave this salad some character and pop!  For the entree I ordered their Braised Pork Cheeks; with parsnip puree, caramelized onion and gorgonzola pretzel bread pudding, chili salt chicharron.  The braised pork was well cooked while the parsnip puree provided a soft subtle creamy texture to the sweet caramelized onions.  I didn't care for the pretzel bread pudding, but overall not a bad dish.  For dessert I wanted the peach upside down cake with coconut gelato, but they ran short!  So I went for the regular menu brownie.  I didn't care for it, but my mates around me loved it.....I had a bite of their peach cake and coconut gelato....I would have rather had that needless to say!\n\nIn the end, our visit to Drexyl was nice cause the place was definitely beautiful.  Service was good and attentive since we did have a large group.  I thought the food was well plated and beautiful!  The food I thought was okay because it was well cooked, but I didn't really care for the ingredients fusion. - Enjoy!
