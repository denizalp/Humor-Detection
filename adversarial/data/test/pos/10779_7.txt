I've been to this bar multiple times. And I have to admit, it's a smashing good time - every time. I brought my black and Mexican girlfriends here and they were like, \"oooh my God we're so out of place.\" But honestly, they weren't. Yeah it's in Scottsdale. But the patrons are nothing like the typical folk around those parts. They're out to have a damned good time. From the girls swinging from the rafters to the awesome Bad Boys 2 quotes (move bitch!), you can't NOT have a good time here. By the end of the night, my friends had changed their tone about the seemingly white trash bar. Ok ok, it's still a bit white trashy, but whatever. It's FUN white trashy. And I'm white so I can say that. shhh.\n\nExpect to leave drunk and satisfied.
