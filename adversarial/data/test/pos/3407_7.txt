OH. MY. GOD. \n\nCHEESEGASM.\n\nCaps lock absolutely necessary, fyi. I had the great fortune of being invited to an event held by the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Association...it was held at Fromagination. The event, you ask? Well, that would be a grand celebration of Grilled Cheese Month!\n\nYes, it exists, and yes, it is AWESOME.\n\nThere was good beer (several varieties of New Glarus), an awesome spread of cheeses, and of course--GRILLED CHEESE. The chef at Fromagination is the guy who came up with the recipes--whether it was the stuffed french toast topped with marscapone and bourbon maple syrup, the bandaged aged cheddar with peppercorn and green apple, or the gouda and blue cheese melt (there were a bunch more), everything was top notch!\n\nIf you like cheese, go here. Like meat? Go here! Most of their meat is from Underground Meat, and it was all spectacular. The breads were from Batch!\n\nMy friend (my +1) wanted me to make a point--one I agree with--about the service\/employees: they were absolutely awesome in every way imaginable. Highly informed, answered all questions we may have had (like what Whiskey was in the ice cream?), and seemed pretty intent on ensuring we had some sort of beverage in our hands at all times (the other hand had noms in it). Just...outstanding.\n\nOh, how I love you Fromagination. And oh yes, I will most certainly be returning for your cheeses...just thinking about the smoked cheddar is making me drool!
