I've had this place bookmarked since I saw the sign go up! I haven't been to the other Kusina Ni Lorraine locations, so I don't have those to compare to, but I really like what i see of this place so far. I'm eager to write a review to spread the word to the Westside Filipino community and lovers of Filipino food - come here, enjoy, and keep this place opened! Far too many businesses have been shuttering lately!\n\nFirst off, it's a turo-turo, which means \"point-point\" in Tagalog. Food is normally displayed on heat trays behind glass and constantly refilled throughout the day. You \"point\" to what you want to order. I grew up eating at Filipino establishments like this, since there weren't too many sit-down Filipino places 20 years ago. My mom would always get a two or three item plate, and we'd split between her, me, and my sister since our appetites were never really that big. Kusina Ni Lorraine (Lorraine's Kitchen) had a wide variety of dishes to choose from and everything looked very fresh and replenished. I ended up getting a two item combo with rice and soup, which was a steal for $7! They gave a large amount of rice, the menudo I ordered filled up both entree containers in the to go box, and my 2nd entree of fried fish was wrapped separately. The menudo was tasty and they didn't try to cut corners on the quality of the meat, veggies, or hot dogs (yes, hot dogs, they are delicious in Filipino cuisine). The fish was a substantial portion that I had a few bites of - saving it for later to enjoy with lemon and patis (aka fish sauce). The sinigang soup was just the right amount of sour too! I ordered some pork BBQ sticks for my husband, but enjoyed the few flavorful bites I did have. The meat quality was good without being too tough or fatty. They open at 7am the whole week, so I'm sure they have some interesting breakfast options that I'll have to come back for.\n\nAside from being a restaurant, this place also is part-grocery store for all your Filipino-focused needs. I saw a wide array of Filipino snacks, key ingredients such as spices and frozen meats, and desserts, including a well-stocked freezer selection of ice cream. The servers were very sweet and generous with their portions. There is seating inside if you'd like to dine in and the site of lolos and lolas enjoying their merienda made me feel very at home. If you're like me and previously from a Filipino-concentrated area (Daly City), I think you'll find a lot to love here.
