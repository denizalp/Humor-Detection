Ugh.  I used to love Papa Johns but this location does not do it justice.  \n\nWe have ordered the buffalo chicken pizza in the past when it was first introduced here.  The base is ranch sauce with sliced chicken strips, bacon, onion, cheese and topped with a swirl of buffalo sauce.  Our Buffalo chicken pizza arrived with no buffalo drizzle on top.  Wouldn't they know this is probably the main ingredient which makes it a 'Buffalo' chicken pizza? \n\nI called to let them know and the manager apologized.  Decided to give them a second chance.  I told them what happened last time.  Again, received the pizza with no buffalo drizzle on top. Seriously?? Even after a phone call to order instead of my normal online ordering they still managed to make this incorrectly.  \n\nBig Fail.
