First impression was great, they had a fun tropical decor setup, music that vibes with the place, and a hand drawn menu.\nThe cashier asked if I liked spicy, so I told her no and she recommended a few non spicy items. I chose the tuna bowl, and it turned out spicy. Ofc I told her after and she just said \"ohh your tolerance is really low...next time tell me NO spice!\" -_- my nose was seriously running and tongue burning at that point but ok.\nGot the Ono poke bowl, which was tuna based. Super lacking in ingredients, tuna just kind of tossed on with some onion and other small garnish items. Aka no vegetables or their major toppings. \nThey also use paper bowls that the rice stick onto, not a great idea.\nAlso got the spam musubi, which was what I expected in terms of flavour. But $3 is too hefty a price for that.\nAlmost every poke review I write, I throw in \"bit overpriced\" but this time I mean it. (Bowl and musubi cost me $19) There are definitely better quality ones out there.
