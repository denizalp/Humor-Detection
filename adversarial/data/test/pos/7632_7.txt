On November 29th at 4:30am I had a reservation scheduled to be picked up at my home for a trip to the airport for a 6:30 flight.  The driver didn't arrive on time or at all.  At 4:40am I called the reservation desk and was told the driver was held up in traffic.  Not thinking too clearly at the time I don't understand where there would be traffic to get held up in at 4:30 in the morning.  When I ended up driving myself to the airport there was no delays on the roads. \n\nAt 4:50 I called the reservation desk again and was told the driver was close to my neighborhood.  \n\nI impatiently waited until 5:00am when I couldn't wait any longer for thier driver.  I got in my vehicle and started driving myself to the airport.  On my way down the road I called the reservation desk again at about 5:03am and was told that the driver was on my road which was not true since I had just driven my road on the way out of my neighborhood.\n\nI have used Omni Limousine for many years and have never had a problem with their service.  The service I received on November 29th was very poor and inexcusable!  I do not see how a driver could be more than 30 minutes late especially at the early hour I was traveling at on this day. Their service was being relied upon to get me safely to the airport at the time I scheduled.\n\nThis incident cost me more money since I had to drive myself.  When I got to the airport Long Term Parking was full due to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  So I ended up having to park in Valet Parking for a cost of $216 for my trip.  Also the delay in leaving my house nearly caused me to be late for my flight.  By the time I got to the gate that morning the aircraft was already boarding.  \n\nThere are many Limousine companies in Las Vegas and as a valued customer of Omni I will more than likely be using other companies from now on.
