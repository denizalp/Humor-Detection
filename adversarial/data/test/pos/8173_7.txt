The best thing is the Banana Nut Muffin! OMG it is TO DIE FOR! How good is it you ask?  My sister made me bring it back to San Diego for her on a business trip! I had to lug the goodness in the car all the way back to OC and then back down to SD! See the love for the muffin and for the sister! I delivered a muffin from so freaking far! lol\n\nYes, it is THAT GOOD! I still think about it that I drool and want to drive to Vegas again just for it! lol The muffin top is flat so more chewy crisp surface area.  We all know that is the best part! \n\nHere are the dishes I recommend.  I have had a bunch of different ones but I only order the Piggy Skillet.  It's the best of all the meat worlds! They put Crisp Bacon, Diced Ham, Pork Sausage, Potatoes, Cheese, and Eggs.. how can you go wrong! Mmmmm meaty cheesy goodness! Yes you can easily make this at home but I want the muffins! lol\n\nThe Chicken Enchilada Omelette is pretty good too.  The chicken inside is tender and flavorful paired with all the condiments on top.  All the dishes are huge and plentiful.  I can never finish it, but that can also be that I scarf down as many muffins on the table and more! lol Still the food is pretty good and the seasoned potatoes are delicious! ^_^ Yum Yum.\n\nIf you are ever in Vegas, be sure to come try it out.  I think the design of the place is cute too, very wholesome! I like the mom and pop feel with cute sweet servers that are very attentive.  I have been back many times since and will keep coming back! Muffins!!! O=p
