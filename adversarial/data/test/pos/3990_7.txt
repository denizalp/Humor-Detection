This is my most favorite \"Shack\" in town! Crepe Shack and Waffles is a fun, funky little whole in the wall eatery. When you first walk in the doors you are welcomed to bright walls and the smell of what seems to be fresh baked cake....but, once you look deeper you realize that beautiful aroma is coming from the freshly made Crepes. SO DELICIOUS!\n\nIf you do not want to be disappointed, then order what I ordered. It was amazing! I got the Rebel Crepe (Bananna, Strawberries and Nutella) with birthday cake ice cream and fresh whip cream. OMG- It was so good that I already know what I am going to be craving whenever I get pregnant, or not...lol .Either way, these crepes mean business.\n\nOverall this is the kind of place you check out at least once. Its pretty yummy and a unique way to hit that sweet spot from time to time. In my opinion, there is really nothing crepey about this place, its all good to me!
