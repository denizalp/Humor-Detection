Came here for takeout for tonight's dinner. They were quite busy with a private party and tons of takeout orders. I was debating between the falafel and the lamb shawarma. Per the nice cashier's suggestion, I ordered the lamb shawarma with a side of fries. After a 7 minute wait and admiring the clean, well-kept interior, my food was ready. When I opened the box, (2 minutes afterwards) I was saddened by the lackluster and limp fries, no salt or seasoning and not cooked well. Nothing special there. The shawarma was chocked full of lamb but was only topped with a hefty amount of raw onions, tomatoes and a little sauce. None of the other toppings listed on the board were present.  The pita was sadly store-bought and served room temperature. The lamb was tough, lukewarm and lacked flavor. I had to go back in just to get hot sauce which made it tolerable but it still wasn't the flavor journey I was expecting. Maybe I just came at a bad time given all of the good reviews. Unfortunately, I have to admit,  I've had better shawarma off street carts. \n\n3 stars for cleanliness and good customer service.
