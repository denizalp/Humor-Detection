This place was delicious! Laid back atmosphere and authentic food. I ordered the pork arepa with an avocado salad. The actual taste of the arepa was amazing, and the only reason I didn't fully enjoy it was my own mistake. I thought that it would have pulled pork, and instead it had more of a thin pork chop. I don't really like pork unless it's a shredded version, but again, that was my fault. My boyfriend got the shredded chicken with avocado sauce and LOVED it. We also got the cassava fries but didn't grab a pic because we were too excited to eat! Haha  Overall, I recommend this place! Great for a cheaper night out and the sandwich is actually very filling!
