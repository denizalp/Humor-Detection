No more juices..that means no more Green Monster Juice....waah...the person taking my order said they stopped making juices because it was not in demand, hard to keep ingredients in stock and it's hard to make? You still can order smoothies though and they did manage to come close to making my drink, just in smoothie form. Still 4 star worthy since I like the ingredients to make my custom bowl of Quiona,Turkey Burger, Pineapple with Cilantro Lime dressing.
