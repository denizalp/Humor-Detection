The only thing contributing to the NY authenticity here is the service. The crust falls short somewhere in between the line of cardboard and the styrofoam you'll find in a car bumper. The pizza as a whole looks like something you'll find in the frozen aisle and tastes even more disintegrated. That may be attributed to them baking cheese pizzas and reheating with whatever toppings you order. It doesn't work that way and to do so in New York would be an automatic death sentence endorsed even by their appalled Jersey neighbors. To call Stevie's New York Style Pizza would be analogous to calling Digiorno Delivery. It's NOT.
