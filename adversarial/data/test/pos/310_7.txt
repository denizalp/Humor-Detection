Okay, look, I love breakfast and I'm usually really picky about the type of spots that I like. But this spot here, lemme tell you, is right up there with the boujie ass spots in the Bay Area that I go to. Although packed and understaffed without a proper hostess, the servers were able to clear a table and get us seated in a timely manner. Our server, Lisa, was very prompt and efficient with her order taking and tasks, and she did it with a beautiful smile.\n\nNow the food, oh lemme tell y'all about the MF food!!! I ordered the steak and eggs, medium rare and over medium...they came out perfectly. They came with a side of toast and potatoes call \"mash Browns\" which tasted like a crispy rice pilaf. I enjoyed them thoroughly. My girlfriend ordered the eggs and sausage sandwich, which in her words was \"better than eggslut.\" That's high praise IMO. The bottomless mimosas that we ordered kept coming, I couldn't even keep up.\n\nAfter we finished our \"first course\" we decided to order some of the lemon poppyseed pancakes we saw on their yelp. And ohhhh fuuuuuuuuh they were good.\n\n5 stars well deserved
