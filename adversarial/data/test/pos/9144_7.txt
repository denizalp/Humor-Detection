I feel like this place changed overnight. I was out of town for a week and when I came back, Vons was gone and Haggen took it's place. I stopped in one night after work to get something to make for dinner. The store itself is gloomy and drab. It almost feels dark in there. The prices are ridiculous and not in a good way. The 2 employees that were working the cash register at 6pm on a weeknight were slow and unenthused. I will make the drive to Smith's or even Fresh and Easy just to avoid this place.
