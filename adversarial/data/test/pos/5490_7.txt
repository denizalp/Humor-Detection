We had noticed this place last week when we went to Oliva for dinner and decided to try it tonight. The dinner menu is different than the lunch menu - the lunch menu focuses on fried chicken, but the dinner menu adds beef and pork dishes, a couple of vegetarian dishes, soups, and appetizers.\n\nNeither of us was that hungry so we did not order appetizers. I ordered a dish described as yellow rice, chicken, egg, potato crisps. My guy got the fried pork dish. We first received small salads with a nice, minimally sweet peanut dressing which i liked. The waiter then brought a sample of their fried plantains for us to try. They were excellent - very sweet and soft in the middle, crispy coating outside. \n\nThe entrees were very nicely presented, with beautiful colors and arrangement - even though they were on paper, which may sound odd but worked. My dish consisted of a fried chicken breast (the same salty fried chicken they serve at lunch), a helping of yellow rice that was flavorful although a little overcooked, and potato crisps that were a cross between home fries and potato chips. They were really well seasoned and interesting. The egg was strips of well cooked omelet - not what I expected, but it worked well with the rice. On the side were two sauces, one mld and one spicy, for dunking the chicken. I enjoyed this dish, but my guy's pork was great. Savory, well cooked, interesting flavors, and lots of ginger. The pork was accompanied by white rice with a hint of ginger as well - a great complement to the pork.\n\nThe service was outstanding. Free appetizer, attentive waiter, answered all our questions, and concerned whether we enjoyed everything. We had a question about one of my sauces and he had the cook come out to tell us what was in it.\n\nTotal meal before tip was $27, including sodas. \n\nWe will definitely be back. Great service, good to great food, and overall a really nice addition to the far west side of Madison.
