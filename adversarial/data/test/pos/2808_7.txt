Thanks to Groupon, we found the gem in our neighborhood.  The dining room is small, so when it's busy, tables are tough to find.  There are only a few chairs next to the hostess stand and it can get really crowded there during peak hours.\n\nWe've ordered the following menu items:\n\nGnocchi w\/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, $10.95\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nicks-scottsdale?select=T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ#T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ\n\n10\" Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza w\/Gorgonzola Cheese, $9.45\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nicks-scottsdale?select=vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQw#vIKi17UY1fSyVSRfNzISQw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nicks-scottsdale?select=U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw#U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw\n\nBaked Ziti, $9.95\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/nicks-scottsdale?select=HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg#HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg\n\nThe Gnocchi & Baked Ziti is delish.  They cook the Gnocchi just the way I like it, al dente.  The Better Half enjoys her Baked Ziti with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce and they oblige her with that special order.\n\nThe Pizza is very very good.  I love Pizza and they do a great job here.\n\nThe service here is good, I wouldn't say excellent.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
