Cafe Chic has great specials!\n\nEspecially on Monday night the Shisha and Tea special for $15 is awesome! Great to share the shisha with a friend or 2.\n\nService is attentive and we were basically the whole table there.\n\nLimited sofa\/lounge seating if that's what you looking for. \n\nThe Red Bull and juice instead of water option is quite interesting. Maybe I should try my shisha with a Red Bull and be wired the whole night!
