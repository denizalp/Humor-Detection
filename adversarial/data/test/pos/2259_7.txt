My real beef patties are with a few things with Ross. For one the stores are horribly disorganized and difficult to maneuver. There are signs pointing out the departments but once in them its sort of a free for all. On my most recent shopping trip the clerks seemed busy reorganizing the areas which I is a very good sign. \n\nAnother problem is the clerks and the check out process.. I mean honestly if you hate your job so much that you need to be curt with every customer, please find a job that makes you happy. Also where does the line start? Its like you're in purgatory trying to figure out which line you're in. Its funny.. look at the flat shelves on your way in and notice how much random stuff that's on those shelves. You know where that stuff comes from? Possible customers ditching the stuff they wanted because the wait is so long. Im guilty too.\n\nIve never been a really big fan of Ross Dress for Less but the good deals on brand name merch will always bring me coming back.
