When my roommate and I were at the Asian street market, a kid handed us a flier for this place offering a 20% off coupon and lunch menu. After eating some of their dishes at the night market we thought it would be worth trying again to see what they are really made of with a full menu. \n\nSo after the gym, i went and picked us up 2 of the Hand roll combos for $15 which came with the choice of 2 regular rolls and a specialty roll. I dont recall what he got in his bento box, but I got philly, spicy tuna, and a tiger roll which came with miso soup and salad. \n\nThe miso soup didnt have tofu but did have green onions and was pretty good. The salad came with a good sesame or ginger dressing. The rolls themselves were pretty good for the price we paid, even if it was the full $15 without the 20% discount, it would have been well worth it based on the amount they gave us.\n\nThe best thing was the service, the general manager was working and was extremely nice and helpful. He made me feel like he really valued our business leading to a very positive experience. I will probably go back to eat at their AYCE offering and come back with an update.
