My girlfriend and I tried out Babalu on a Thursday night. The place was nearly full at 8:30, but there was no wait. My first impression... This place is too loud. I'm sure it's a flaw in the building's design. \n\nI love the way the hostess made sure to tell us our server's name and introduced himself with a name card. It's a little detail, but it gives the impression that he is invested in providing a pleasant experience. \n\nThe good was five star. My only complaint... The tacos were too heavily dressed and became soggy. The short rib came with some amazing polenta. \n\nEverything was overshadowed by the waitress serving the next table. She was really excited about her pet box turtles. So excited, that she had to show everybody pictures on her phone and describe each one in detail. Did I mention that she was yelling at the top of her lungs? It was all very amusing.
