This review is exclusively for the T Cook's (if it is part of T Cook's) lounge area only as we did not stay in the hotel. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, however, we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here. In summary, we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w\/ our friends and family.  My husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before NYE to help us decide if we should spend NYE there. He did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website, the Lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month.  He called to verify and to see if we needed reservations, the woman who answered was quite nice, he said, and confirmed the start time of the entertainment. How fun, we thought! We dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this Lounge; we went wednesday december 28, 2011 and arrived at 6pm. The grounds are absolutely beautiful-we were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to The Lounge.  First off, we walked in, there was no hostess\/host, no one to greet us- not knowing if we were in the right place, we looked around and at that time a waitress (or maybe the bus girl?) practically ran past us, clearly not wanting to be side tracked.  My husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking away\/running away, she said that there wasn't any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the \"bar supervisor\". My husband and I looked at each other wondering, huh? So we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses, Kathryn and i think another bar person. We stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us, which they didn't, so after a few awkward seconds my  husband  asked them if this was the place, etc...Truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation; we felt, at this point, very unwelcome and it hadn't even been 5 minutes since we arrived. We were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there's no flamenco entertainment here.  They all looked at each other to ask themselves, is there flamenco entertainment here? One said no, the other one had no idea and Kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside. All this while, no one was speaking to us, there were speaking amongst themselves. We found this to be extremely rude, impolite and uninviting. I think my husband asked if food was served there, Kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall (TCooks) that served food.  We felt pretty uninvited there, like she was shooing us away, actually now that i think about it, so we walked to TCooks and realized that we weren't in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to The Lounge. We didn't get a 'welcome back' or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit. The waitress Kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order. The hors d'hoerves were good, but I have to mention this: when the \"bus girl'? I didn't get her name served us the food, not a word from her. My husband politely said, \"Thank you\" as she served us the food and still not a word back from her. She's the one that nearly ran us over -i noted her above. All in all,  I'm not sure what was going on w\/ their service staff,  I really feel they just didn't want to be there and secondly,  they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service.\nRude, impolite, unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there. Definately not a place we will return to-that includes the resort.   We did not stay for the originally much anticipated flamenco entertainment which ended up being inside and not outside like were told-we felt too unwelcomed.
