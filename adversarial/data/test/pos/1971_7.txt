I waited a good long time to try this one out.  Everyone seemed to be singing its praises and I was convinced that there was no way it could be that good.  Apparently the masses were right.  The food is delicious (reasonably priced, no entree creeps up past the $25.00 mark and most in fact are around $15.00 dollars).  On Sundays they do a half-price wine deal which can't be beat and they are brave enough to re-acquaint folks with the much maligned pink wines.\nOne complaint is that they don't have much by way of vegetarian items.  You could get the vegetarian spaetzel or try the sausage and grits without the sausage.  (They were delicious by the way, Schreiner's sausage and sun dried tomatoes yum!).  The burgers are served on Brioche and topped with Boursin cheese.   The green chile stew could give the one at St. Francis a run for its money.  I would have liked it more spicy, but the cornbread was heavenly.  Oh and don't skip dessert.  Desserts are $6.00 dollars (a steal for what you get).  We had the chocolate covered bacon, served with Becket's s'mores which are graham crackers, homemade peanut butter mousse and homemade marshmallows.  The pecan and fig pie is amazing (the pie crust itself is a thing of beauty) but what tops it off for me is the Crave ice cream in a special Beckett's only cream cheese ice cream.  It tastes like marscapone and lemon zest in which I can only hope Heaven will serve.  Or Hell. I don't care where I go so long as it has that dessert!
