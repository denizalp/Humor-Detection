The average life expectancy for a Canadian male  is approximately 78 years. \n\nThe average life expectancy for a Russian male is approximately 58 years.\n\nRussia has one of the lowest life expectancies in the developed world, and unlike the Canadian figure, the number is falling dramatically. \n\nOne of the chief reasons for this disparity is the near-endemic incidence of alcoholism in that country. According to the infallible wikipedia, alcoholism is a pervasive problem in the country, while alcohol consumption is a chief revenue-generator for the government. As many as one in eight deaths in Russia may be attributed to alcohol. \n\nSo you can imagine how it feels to write a straight-edge review of Pravda vodka bar. \n\nThe most appealing aspect of this place is the sheer variety of vodkas available, on ice, as they should be. This compared to the lukewarm Diet Coke I nursed while admiring the surroundings. \n\nAnd there's what to admire; the room is a series of caverns and alcoves, surfaces covered in rich red fabrics. Past Party leaders glower at you from above, in all their brutalist glory.  If you're a history buff, you'll know that given their penchant for assassinating each other, they'd be better served keeping an eye on each other. \n\nWear a flashy suit, and you too can feel like a young oligarch in training. \n\n The main area is dominated by a bar one one side, and a large communal table on the other. Servers and busboys try to slide by mid-conversation, which limits one's flow. Not that there's much room for conversation. The place is packed, and the noise is loud enough to rival a proletariat demonstration against the bourgeoisie. \n\nLive music plays on your way into the bar, but you're shuttled to the back, and a constant stream of indistinct techno. Periodically, somebody recognizes the beat and a brief roar goes up from the crowd. It's too small a space to dance, so we all groove and sway on our feet as one. \n\nI've often wondered what a real Soviet ex-pat would say about this kind of place. Is it a kitchy reminder of home, or a slap in the face to those who were brutalized by a totalitarian regime. Yeah, I may be a bit of a kill-joy, but it's hard to think of Stalin as a benevolent cartoon character.
