Formerly known as \"Sundays\"  this place has really changed. They have decent food, a laid back bar, patio, and Karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday nights. (located next to Zipps on Camelback)\n\nThis is a very casual restaurant\/bar - it could almost classify as a dive bar -- but the drinks are too pricey for that. They have definitely moved in the right direction decor wise and they need to keep moving that way...\n\nI'm pulling for you...
