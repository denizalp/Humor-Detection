Since the late 80's, I have been visiting Coventry. Big Fun was always at the top of my list of stops.\n\nThis store has so much freaky\/cool\/questionable\/junky\/trashy\/wonderful stuff I've ever seen in one place.\n\nI used to buy a lot of tiny plastic fetuses for art projects in college. Yah, that's how I roll. \n\nAlso scored a Divine magnet and some plastic poo. \n\nSteve Presser is one cool dude and his shop is fab. \nNever boring. \nAlways entertaining.
