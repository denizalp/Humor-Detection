I have always passed by this restaurant over the years and just end up at the Kenny Noodle next door just because it looked pretty packed and expensive.  This time I went there for a food run with a few Yelpers and it was still pretty packed and expensive.\n\nThe food we ordered were excellent though, save for the rice dish.\n\nPork belly and Steamed fish was still standard fare, I eat this dish regularly so it wasn't anything special, but they weren't bad.\n\nSome of the more interesting fare was the wintermelon top thingy.  Wintermelon  + anything is usually refreshing on the colder days.  This was no exception.  The soup was a vegetarian dish, but it was still awesome enough for a meatatarian like me.\n\nThe crab and egg dish was pretty unique in presentation, the taste was also good.  Alarmingly good in fact.  I haven't eaten these ingredients in this configuration so ++ points for it.\n\nAlthough steamed oyster is a standard fare for me, this run let me try two different ways of eating it: garlic and black bean.  Garlic still wins hands down.  The black bean one was a bit tart for my taste.\n\nThe other thing that's unique for me was the stuffed duck.  Not much really to say here, it's just good.  At this point my taste buds were already too overwhelmed I can't remember things anymore.\n\nThe most interesting one was the chicken \/ fish mousse.  It's a dish where there's a layer of chicken over a layer of fish paste to make it look like a mousse.  I haven't eaten anything like it before and I regretted not eating more of it.  The combination was excellent.\n\nI'll definitely come here again, probably with some rich relatives and have to make sure I do a reservation.:D
