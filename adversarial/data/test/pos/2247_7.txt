This place has been AWFUL since they changed hands and today was the final straw for me. My wife and I have been going to this vet for 4 years and it was fantastic when Dr. D owned the place. Shortly after it changed hands I noticed that there was entirely new staff who were incredibly poorly trained. The front desk women that I had known and loved were gone and they were replaced by a girl with black hair and glasses that had a very hard time performing the simplest functions of her job. I don't think it was due to a lack of competence on her part, but because she had not been properly trained.\n\nThe new groomer was awful- we warned her that our dog Freud was aggressive with strangers and that she could use a muzzle if needed. She ended up soaping him up and then said he got too \"nippy\" with her and \"rinsed\" him off and sent him home. She was so eager to leave the place that she left before we were able to drive 15 minutes to pick him up. A couple days later we noticed that Freud had formed an enormous rash because she didn't rinse all the soap off of him. Paradise Pet Hospital was unapologetic, but thankful ly Dr. D waived the exam fee when I brought him in.\n\nI noticed that my cat Kaiju had been walking in circles so I brought him in to be checked out. The brand new vet told me that his ears looked fine so he was probably just giving himself multiple concusions and it was nothing I should be worried about. He said the only thing we could really do was give him a blood test, so we did. He did not warn me about the cost and it turned out to be VERY expensive. My cat died two months later.\n\nAs if I wasn't pissed off enough about my dead cat... Today my dog Teek got something stuck in her nose. The vet we switched to (East Charleston Animal Hospital) is closed on Sundays. I called Paradise Pet Hospital and told them about the situation and the receptionist said to come in. After coming in we waited and the new owner\/ vet came out (obviously annoyed), barely looked at us, and told us that she had too much to do today and didn't have time to even look at Teek. She offered to refer us to her other location across town. I said \"this is why we switched vets\" and walked out. We ended up going to Desert Inn animal hospital and they we great.\n\nHeed my words- don't give this vet your business. The owner seems like she doesn't care about animals. East Charleston has been much better for us.
