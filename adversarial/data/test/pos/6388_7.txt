Grabbed a drink here at Anthony's Gourmet Burgers & Brews while at the M Resort.  All of their burgers on the menu incorporated some sort of beer into the recipe.  I only had the Apple martini and a green salad, so I can't say that I tried the burgers.  My boyfriend had a java stout beer.  He said it was too much bitter coffee tasting so he wouldn't order it again.  We met up with my cousin, her fiance, and her dad here for drinks.  They ordered the Totchos (tater tot nachos), Caesar salad, wings, and clam chowder.  For my salad, I asked if they had a vinaigrette which they thankfully served on the side.  It tasted predominantly of horseradish which was off-putting to me.  I kind of hated it.  The salad itself was just a green salad and was fine.  I should have gone with the garlic parmesan fries.  Oh well.  My Apple-tini was fine and strong.  For some reason, the bartender gave me a glass of water without my asking which was really nice.  No one else at in our party received any water, despite ordering beer.  Maybe it was because their drinks were not as high in alcohol content?  Who knows?  The service was fine and if I ever return to try their burgers, I'll update my review.
