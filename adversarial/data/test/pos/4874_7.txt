Overpriced & overrated.  I had drinks & dinner here once with the BF.  The bartender was super cute, accommodating & friendly. The wait staff was friendly. The food was on the steep side and frankly not so great.  Perhaps my expectations were overblown as I'd heard so many good things about TICOZ over the years.  \n\nThe thing that skanked me out the most was an app that I'd had high hopes for -- a curious blend of 2 of my fave things lin life (fresh hummus & fresh guac), but it really failed as an ensemble.  The chef was super awesome & she came out and chatted with us.  Not b\/c I complained or anything.  Just cuz...  I liked that.\n\nAll in all I owe TICOZ another visit b\/c I feel like I missed something...but I'll have to wait until I get that raise...
