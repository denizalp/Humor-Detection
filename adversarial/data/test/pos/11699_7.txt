I went back here another time recently...\n\nThe food was tasty and well, pretty much the same as the first time I went.\n\nBut...I forgot to mention the wonderful entertainment while dining.\nDirectly across the street you have a perfect view of the stripclub\/hotel for your people watching pleasure.\n\nIt took us 15 minutes to eat.\nIn that time we saw a homeless man peeing on a mailbox and an illegal exchange of illicit substances...\n\nAnyways, there is another location on Adelaide if you don't want to venture east of Dundas Square.
