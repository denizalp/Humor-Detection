This place is just out right disgusting. Every time I come here, (which isn't often only because it's convenient) there's always problems. I swear it really depends who's working because employees here are mostly rude. I never feel welcomed. I highly suggest you order your food \" off the broiler \" otherwise it's gonna be old. Don't even get me started on when they tell you to pull around and wait 20 mins for food. What's going on at this location? I might as well go to the Durango location down the street.
