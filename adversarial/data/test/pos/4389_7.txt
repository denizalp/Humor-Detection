Stopped in for lunch and went straight for the \"classic\" Bahn Mi, making only one customization and that was to skip the jalapenos. A few minutes later, my sandwich was brought to me at the table, fresh.\n\nIt was perfect. The bread was crunchy and crumbly on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The meat, the cheese and the veggies were fresh tasting and loaded with flavor. The veggies were especially crispy and crunchy. It was an EXCELLENT sandwich.\n\nYum!
