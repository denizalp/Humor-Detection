I have been a tenant for just over a year and I am renting a Condo in Henderson. Unfortunately, my property manager Kathy Cupich is not responsive to phone calls or email. I have had 2 main issues with them, which includes a name change and communication with  the HOA in my complex. \n\nIn regards to the name change: It took me a year to change my name, which I would think would be a simple task. I sent numerous emails and called a number of times. I received no response from my property manager at all if she was working on this. After contacting several people in the office I finally was able to get someone in the front office willing to submit the change for me. \n\nIn regards to communication, there were quite a few issues and one is still ongoing. I had an Air conditioner fail and it took almost 2 weeks to get a new one because communication with the AC company wasn't happening. I am not exactly sure if it was the owner or the property manager. I was not given updates as to the status of the replacement. If you have ever lived in Vegas and have kids and animals you can understand the importance of this. \n\nAnother issue related to communication is related to HOA rules. The HOA company changed and some of the rules they started to enforce were different. I was not getting the communication from the HOA through the management company of these changes so I was fined $100. I tried to ask why the charge was made and they told me there were 3 notifications sent to the owner. I did not receive these notifications or what to fix. Currently, the HOA shows this fine as not being paid when I paid it on 6\/1\/16. I am not sure if this is a problem with the HOA or the management company. Neither of which seem to want to communicate since I am just the tenant. The HOA wants to charge me another $100 since they show no payment. My property manager Kathy is not available through email or phone to tell me she is even working on this problem. \n\nUnfortunately, I got a two-year lease and I am stuck for a while longer, but my main motivation to move is the communication with Robinson Realty. I would love to change property managers or get out of my lease early.\n\nOn a positive note, their maintenance is very fast and reliable, but the follow through on getting bigger repairs is not there.
