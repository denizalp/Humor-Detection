If you were wondering why the Irish are so lucky, I have a theory: because they can charge $15 for a salad! I kid. I kid. McMullan's costs a little more than you might anticipate, but I didn't feel as if I had been cheated. The quality and atmosphere pretty much justify the cost.\n\nThe interior is cozy thanks to deep, dark wood and little nooks and crannies. It would definitely make a nice stop for drinks during a date escapade possibly for all date stages, i.e. dinner too, if you were looking for something casual but not totally cheap or Applebee's. Stop here, and then go bowling at The Orleans... now that's a plan.\n\nWe went on Thursday, which is when they offer AYCE fish and chips. I ate some of the chips and found them delicious. The fish is cod-- not shabby. For my entree, I had the blackened chicken salad, and I was impressed with the size, flavor and freshness. Granted, when you throw little fried onion shoestrings on top of anything it is going to be pretty tasty, but that doesn't mean I love it any less! \n\nWe didn't partake in any of the beer, whiskey or magical desserts, but that is all part of the package here as well. We had two iced teas, and those were better than your average iced tea.  \n\nI was ready to go strong with 5-stars, but when the $35 bill arrived, I loved it just a little less. I have definitely been spoiled by the cost of eating cheap Asian cuisines!
