So much fun! I've been to the after hours spot but this time came to the main drais.  There was something about this place that felt really open and not packed like sardines. I loved the huge stage and the light effects. The ceilings have a led screen.  The music was on point and I danced the night away. The crowd that night was super diverse.  Lots of people, little drama.   Easy to navigate when inside instead of a maze like a lot of vegas clubs. Can't wait for the summer beach club!
