The bae and I ordered the family dinner A.\nThe lady at the counter is VERY accommodating to my boyfriends needs. He always seems to complicate things when we eat out. Anyway!\n\nDinner A; comes with egg rolls (2), crab rangoons (2), soup of your choice, rice of your choice and two entrees of your choice.\n\nMy boyfriend wanted to replace the two egg rolls with two more crab rangoons. The lady was very sweet and said I'll give you the egg rolls for free. And she also added four more crab rangoons for free. So we had six crab rangoons in total. How sweet of her???\nThere were also two entrees to choose from. I picked the Mongolian beef and of course my boyfriend wanted something else that wasn't on the list of entrees. He asked if he can get the teriyaki chicken entree instead. And that's what he got! You can also choose from white rice or BBQ pork fried rice. Obviously, I got the BBQ pork fried rice (If you haven't seen my pictures yet.) and lastly we got the egg drop soup. Yum!!! One of my choosings!!! I also ordered my thai tea. \n\nNow, I've been fasting for the last week or so. So I only eat at night! #carbnite I'm not sure if it was because I haven't ate all day but damn, the Mongolian beef was good :p and the soup and the teriyaki chicken and everything else. I definitely was satisfied! Especially the amount of food that was given. We had leftovers... Well, the bae had left overs. He finished everything by that night. I was so full. I couldn't eat anymore!\nAnd I almost forgot... The Thai tea. If you know me, I like thai tea a lot. But this one not so much. It lacked flavor. So I didn't finish it and ended up throwing it away. Overall, everything was good. Service was good too. We didn't wait so long. Food was really hot! I enjoyed it. Will be coming back (: \n\n*For the amount of food that was given. I couldn't complain about the price.
