DON'T sign up for the bachlorette package via their website.  I was there for a bachelorette and the lady (katie?) who worked for the club told us that we would get admission (VIP line- no wait) and 2 free drinks for $30. We did it because we didn't want the hassle to wait in line and two drinks, great deal.  We paid and she told us to contact Joseph who works with her when we get there and he would walk us right in.  Later that night, my friend contacted Joseph, no answer.  She then texted him that we were here as instructed and he responded, \"I'll see what I can do\".  Ummm, ok...  We waited for about 5 minutes until finally one of the guards spotted us and brought us to the front.  Finally, we were inside, Joseph never contacted us.  We also found out that the drinks were for well drinks only which she failed to inform us.  \n\nIf you're a bunch of ladies, you'll get into most clubs for free so don't pay for anything!  The club was nice, but not worth what we went through.  Go to Tao.
