I adore this place. Maybe it's because they don't pull any punches. The food is the way it is: authentic and they could give a shit if you like or not. They serve authentic Korean and if you're looking to have it your way then go to Burger King. The Bee Bim Bop is pretty amazing.  I'm not a fan of the corn tea so I usually bring a huge liter of water.
