Madison is the only place in the whole world I would move to without a second thought. \n\nDon't get me wrong, MInneapolis, I do love you. It's just that Madison makes me feel....good about myself. She's prettier and smaller and is full of bat shit crazy drunkos (and not just the bloated, pasty ones you have.) \n\nI'm not breaking up with you, Minneapolis, but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop cheating on you anytime soon.
