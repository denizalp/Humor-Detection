Bob Taylor's wasn't a colossal disappointment.  By all accounts it was good, but I guess I kind of feel like I got ripped off somehow.  Now, by no means did they rip me off, I don't want anyone to get the feeling that they pulled one over on us or anything.  \n\nWe came here as a big group for the $1\/oz prime rib night.  Certainly a 16 oz. prime rib for $16 is a great deal.  To sum up the meal, it's extra $5 for the sides, extra for the drinks, and by the end of the night it came out to around $35 per person.  Certainly not a bad deal, but still a bit deceptive thinking your 12 oz. was going to cost $12.  The steak was cooked medium for a medium rare order, and the 1 level overcook seemed pretty consistent for everyone.  I would say quality of the meat would be considered okay, but certainly not at the level approaching anything close to Lawry's.  \n\nService is excellent and pleasant.  Atmosphere is great and the western decor is appropriate to the name and atmosphere.  Not sure I would do it again, but probably worth everyone trying it once.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  Probably not a great idea based on the crowd and the family-oriented atmosphere.
