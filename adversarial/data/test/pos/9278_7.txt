The beer education of Misti Y could have very easily been completed tonight if I hadn't had to run off to catch an art show. I am a beer-drinker, but nowhere near the connoisseurs that frequent Aces and Ales. There was a special selection of Rogue brews on tap starting tonight, and the occasion brought out some deep beer lovers--avid home brewers, the Beer Meet-up organizer. In addition to sipping the suds on tap, they brought out special bottles to share. Passion was in the air.\n\nBecause I am just a lowly drinker, I can't say that I am the most qualified to determine the quality of the beer selection, but based on the survey of the crowd, this is the place to be. I trust them. They did mention Freakin' Frog and Yardhouse, but for straight-up quality and not quantity, they agreed Aces delivers best. I tried the Rogue Hazelnut: delicious. I also tested a Belgian ale. The name escapes me, but I wish I could have handled an entire glass! I had to drive.\n\nWhen I arrive, I was starving, so I ordered some grub. I was impressed to see a veggie burger on the menu and sweet potato fries. The veggie burger was a pretty standard Morning Star-esque patty, and it came on a sesame seed bun with a nice stack of lettuce, onions, tomatoes and pickles. It was charred agreeably. The sweet potato fries were a tad salty, but I finished every morsel of sustenance on my plate. Overall, it was a solid offering for bar food. I would not be afraid to come here hungry.\n\nAs for the physical atmosphere, the bar was a large, clean and comfortable video-poker bar with pool tables. Nothing trendy or thematic, but I was impressed by the lack of overbearing smoke, and the fact that one TV station was dedicated to music videos on FuseTV.  Plus, the co-owner is the guitar player for Alice Cooper. That earns bonus atmosphere points, as does the friendly staff. \n\nI am torn between 4 and 5 stars. I am a sucker for bold interiors, and Aces is a straightforward bar. Still, I know that most of the people coming here see everything through beer goggles, and if designer ones are your thing, then this is 5 stars all the way. For specialty beer passion, this is as good as it gets in Las Vegas.
