I'm going to get shot for saying this but I don't care... I typically prefer Americanized Chinese food to its' \"authentic\" counterpart. Yup, I'd rather eat here than 80% of SMR. I'm entitled to my opinion, no matter how stupid or weird it is damnit ! The place is clean, I don't get nasty MSG bloat after eating here, and the service is actually good. It's reliable and I don't get weird grisley meat pieces like you get in hole in the wall type spots. I have my reasons, and sometimes good ole reliable Pei Wei is a better option for me than being \"adventurous\" and eating the fish swimming around the murky smelly tank in Chinatown !\n\n\nWhat I love about Pei Wei:\n*Quick - I can order online and pick it up in 10 minutes\n*Cheap and reliable\n*I can add on teriyaki noodles for like $2 \n*I can make my rice into fried rice for $1 more\n*Honey seared chicken ROCKS\n\nYup, Pei Wei never lets me down !
