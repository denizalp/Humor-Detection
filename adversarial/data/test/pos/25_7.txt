Been here a few times and every time I came here with my coworker it was alway a great experience.  We usually come here Friday afterwork to help us transition from the work week to the personal weekend.  It helps us keep work life out of our personal lives.  \n\nEvery-time the server was super delightful and friendly and the service was always excellent.  The place is always clean and very very inviting.  The loo is always quite clean, so it helps reassure me that their kitchen is well kept too.  \n\nWhenever I come I always order the same thing, their shepherds pie.  It is absolutely amazing and would recommend it if you're into mashed potato and meats.  My coworker would always order the spinach dip thing and fries and whatever alcohol he felt. \n\nOverall a good place.  Never had a bad time here!
