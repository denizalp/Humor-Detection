What an awful place!!! I brought my Pomeranian for a hair cut and told them specifically to trim a little; when I picked up my dog, what a disaster! They shaved him down to the skin but did not touch the hair around his head, nor the tail.  Whoever cuts his hair definitely has no idea how to do it.  They should have told me if they don't know how to cut a Pomeranian. When I saw my dog, I was speechless and I will never recommend anyone to bring their dogs for this torture!!
