I could have Sakana for lunch every week!  It's a busy restaurant but staff, front and back are efficient and it never takes long before our food makes it to the table.  I had their Sakana lunch special which consists of assorted sashimi and tuna sushi, plus a miso soup and salad.  It's a lot of food, l never finish it, especially all the rice that goes with it, hidden under the sashimi.  Good value for sure!
