I needed some slings for my JBL speargun. The shop had a decent supply of speargun slings, but not the particular size or brand I needed. The sales guy said he could order them and it would take about a week. So I gave him my contact information and he said he would call me when the slings arrived. Two weeks go by and no call from El Mar Dive Shop. I decided to head over to the shop and check on my order. The same guy who said he would order the slings tells me he forgot to place the order. He asked if I still wanted him to place the order, reluctantly I said ok. Again, he takes down my contact information and tells me he will give me a call when the slings arrive in about a week. Three weeks go by and again no call from El Mar. So again I decide to head over to the shop to check on my order. This time the same guy, I didn't get his name, says the slings arrived. I asked him why I didn't get a phone call, he acted surprised and said somebody should have called. He then lays the slings on the counter, but they are not the size that I ordered. He then tells me that the company they order from, Trident, only makes them in certain sizes and they didn't have my size. So this guy went ahead and ordered the wrong size for me anyway and then tried to sell them to me. I said no thanks and walked out. \n\nI always try to do business with local merchants. These days, with the economy the way it is, one would think that a business, especially a dive shop in the desert, would provide better customer service to earn peoples' repeat business. \n\nForgetting to place my order, failure to call me twice after saying they would, ordering the wrong size merchandise...three (actually four) strikes...YOU'RE OUT, El Mar!
