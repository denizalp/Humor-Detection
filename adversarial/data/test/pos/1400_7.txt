I was clocked doing 78 in a 35 a few weeks ago at night.\n\nThe motorcycle cop said the person next to me was going faster, he even laughed about it, then he decided that he will do me a favor and lower the clocked speed to 50 in a 35. Well isn't that nice of him. So basically he clocked the car next to me but I looked like the perfect person to receive a nice fat speeding ticket. \n\nWell whatever! Despite having been pulled over a million times...I hadn't had a ticket in almost 15 years.\n\nI didn't want any points on my license nor our car insurances to go up...so I found LV Traffic Ticket Guy on Yelp.\n\nGot an update today that this lawyer went to court for me, I do not have any points going on my license now, the ticket is now an illegal parking ticket, and I don't have to go to traffic school.\n\n100% satisfaction! I'm impressed. Logging in to pay my illegal parking ticket fee and it's all the past!\n\nNice to have such an amazing service that saves you time and trouble. \n\nTime to slow down :D
