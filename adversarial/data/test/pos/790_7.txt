I have many fond memories of this place - and many not so memorable ones as well. I threw my first perfect cricket game here. BTW, that's darts for those of you who don't know what I was referring to - and that was the only reason why I stopped in on my last visit to Las Vegas. Well, that and beer.\n\nThe place is cozy which means it's not very big but it's big enough if you're not in a big group and you're just throwing darts and drinking some adult beverages. I didn't try the food but I recall back in the day, it wasn't \"all that\" unless you were drunk. There's tons of restaurants on Spring Mountain. \n\nI'm a fan of just about every bar that still hangs up steel tip dart boards. I love darts - and I don't mean the soft tip variety. I mean, c'mon! How many sports allow you to drink alcohol (I do) and throw sharp projectiles?
