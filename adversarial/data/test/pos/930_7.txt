Convenient for picking up a few bits here at the Food Lion. Prices are definitely lower than what you'll see at Teeter or Publix. The store is clean and reasonably well stocked.\n\nProduce looked good, dairy was excellent and they had a good selection of beer and wine.\n\nEasy enough to get your shop paid for but I did not see any self-checkout open. The young lady working the register was fine with scanning the store card as I don't have a Food Lion shopper card.
