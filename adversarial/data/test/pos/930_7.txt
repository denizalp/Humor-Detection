In addition to running a shop, teaching classes online, creating his own Tarot deck and writes a fabulous Tarot blog, Andrew also conducts Tarot experiences for those looking for unique, in deptth, soul searching and compassionate Tarot reading.\n\nAndrew wrote a blog post about a certain card that struck home so hard for me I gasped, he hit home in a way that I rarely talk about and articulated about a challenge of mine that is deep and very personal. On the strength of his writing I signed up for a Tarot reading and Andrew did not disappoint. He was engaging, direct, accurate, considerate and even followed up with a pic of the cards and their positions so I could look at them later. The only thing I disliked was the fact that we had to do it online as I would have loved having the experience with him in his shop.\n\nI am still thinking about and processing the experience I had with him. He is not the kind of telephon-a-psychic that will tell you the color of your future home or the letter of  a first  born child, no gimmicks. Andrew is calming, honest, very perceptive\/intuitive and just...magic. You cannot go wrong with the Hermit's Lamp.
