We stayed here for a night and thank goodness it was just one night. First off, our room smelled like fried wontons right when we walked in. Called for housekeeping, never came. Second, there were a lot of wear and tear. A lot of hotels have this, but this one in particular was really bad. The toilet had dried urine stains, the sinks had rust on it. The dried urine stain was honestly REALLY nasty. And lastly, the most annoying thing was that they only had ONE valet guy working! ONE! This happened twice here for our one day stay. I felt bad for the valet guy because he kept apologizing for the delay; it really wasn't his fault though. Palms, hire more valet people, please!
