I am biased; I witnessed one of the funniest scenes of my life here.\n\nHOB was pleasantly surprising. I would never have thought they'd have such attentive servers and really delicious food. My dad's friends made the reservation, so I didn't have a say in any of the matter.\nThe atmosphere is a bit chain-y, but it's pretty, and the bathroom is really big!\nAnyway, everybody liked their entree, and our server was so nice, dealing with our rowdy group. The band was a 90s rock group specializing in girl power songs like No Doubt and Alanis, and I loved it. The sound is great, too.\nAfter too many drinks, some poor girl decided to dance-attack my dad on the dance floor. She seemed lost from her friends. She wasn't wearing underwear....and I can't quite explain the scene when she tried doing back bends in her mini skirt, on my DAD. My mom watched in pure shock as the whole group completely lost it. Not sure if I've ever laughed that hard in my life. What happens in Vegas, goes on Yelp.\nThe staff handled it very well. They were nice to the girl, but needless to say, she had to go auf wiedersehen. They escorted her out and we got a story to tell for years.
