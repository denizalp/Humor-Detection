I celebrated my birthday here last night, and as previous yelpers said, keep an eye on your tab! Lol \n\nThe good: \nGreat selection of songs that don't sound like someone is playing the piano version of your favorite tune. :-p The rooms are trendy, comfortable, and spacious. The food is the average \"finger food\" you'd expect at a bar, but it's tasty. Customer service is great and food and drinks are served quickly.\n\nThe not-so-good: \n I went during happy hour and it only includes the room. Drinks are not included in the happy hour if you're there for karaoke. Compared to other karaoke bars where I get get happy hour on both the room and the drinks, this isn't really a good deal. Happy Hour doesn't apply even if you're waiting in the lounge to go into the room...booo :(
