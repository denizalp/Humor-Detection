Pregnant ladies need to float. We need to feel weightless for just one heavenly hour a week.  The pool at High Park Village Fitness is rented by Baby & Me Fitness for their weekly \"Aqua-bellies\" aquafit class. Cutesy names aside, the workout is both relaxing and challenging and the instructors are top-notch. Each class has a discussion period for 30 minutes about various pregnancy topics and is a good way to get to know other pregnant ladies in the neighbourhood. Highly recommended!
