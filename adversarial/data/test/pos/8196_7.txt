Had a great experience here with my friends! The food was good, the drinks were perfect, and the service was exceptional. \n\nSierra Gold has a variety of beers and a cider on tap, the later of which was my preference. I wish they had more than one flavor cider, but at least they had one! We had an assortment of food, but the chicken fingers and fries were the best option. The fingers were a good size, the sauce was good and well mixed, and the fries were great. \n\nI love the mountain cabin feel atmosphere in here. They even have a spot for groups that is next to wine coolers and is lined with leather sofas and soft lighting.
