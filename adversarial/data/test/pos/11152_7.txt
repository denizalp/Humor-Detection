This review is based on selling books, or pardon me, trying to sell a book.\n\nI recently read on here that they take books.  Ok, sounds good to me.  I've got many a book I had to buy for university (not textbooks), think general lit.  I called, spoke to the 'buyer' and he said they have to take a look at the condition.  No problem.\n\nI walked there on a hot day, I had three books with me.  One of which is a Charles Dickens book.  It's really big and they do have multiple copies of books, if i didn't know better I'd say it was a new bookstore.  Anyways, moving right along.  I see the \"selling\" desk and I ask the guy at the front where I go to see if they'll take my books.  He points me over to the empty counter.\n\nI wait for five minutes, go back and ask the guy at the front \"Is there anyone working there?\"  \"Yeah, he should be back soon\"  Another ten minutes go by and finally some guy comes.  I tell him that I'd like to know if my books are worth anything.  As I take them out of the bag he roughly grabs them out of my hand, flips through them all and says \"no we can't take any of these\".  Ok, no need to be so rough about it.  Geez... I think you devalued whatever my books were worth.\n\nWhat really makes me confused is if you know by looking at the cover it isn't any good why do you have to flip through it?  He didn't bother using the computer to look up the value of my books, (I am guessing the computer is used to look up prices, unless the computer is for aesthetic purposes only.\n\nMy books were gently used in really good condition, no creases or pen marks. But after he roughly went through them I'm not so sure.  \n\n\nPlease don't man handle the book if you have no intention of taking it because its not what your interested in.  It seemed as though I had inconvenienced him by making me wait fifteen minutes.  Dude was in a huff mood for sure.\n\nThey had some cookbooks, one that was signed by renowned chef Martin Yan...\n\nHowever, if you plan on selling books here I suggest you go donate them instead of wasting your time hauling the books here only to have to wait and when you are finally served, made to feel like they are doing you a favor by making them look at YOUR worthless books...Is this what going to a pawnshop feels like?
