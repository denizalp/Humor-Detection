Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill is a 290-seat restaurant located inside Caesars Palace.  It is a restaurant that brings the British Pub experience to you with the atmosphere as well as the authentic British pub foods that it offers.\n\nUpon walking up to the front entrance of the restaurant, I noticed a bunch of barrels stacked on top of each other.  The decor of the place was pretty cool.  The lighting was very dim and obviously this is a casual restaurant since it is supposed to mimic a British pub.  The pub has 36 different beers on tap as well as another 63 different bottled beers.  I don't drink so this was not a selling point for me.  I was more there for the Gordon Ramsay food and because the winner of Hell's Kitchen for one of the seasons was supposed to be the main chef at this particular restaurant. \n\nThe bf and I did not have to make reservations to Pub & Grill and we were glad to find out that there was no wait time.  This was possibly the foreshadowing of what was to come after we were seated.\n\nPub & Grill does serve a 3-course meal, but since the bf and I had just done the Hell's Kitchen courses at Gordon Ramsay's Steak inside Paris the night before, we decided not to do the courses at Pub & Grill.  We both ordered our own dishes and shared.\n\nWe ordered the GRP Lolli-Pop Chicken Wings which came with a stilton blue cheese dip.  You can either order a dozen wings which is $22 or 1\/2 dozen wings which is $12.  As you can see from the picture, I felt like we got ripped off.  All we got were luke warm puny looking chicken wings that were overpriced in my opinion.  For $12, you'd expect to at least not be served wings from anorexic chickens.  Is it too much to expect hot food instead of warm?  Ramsay would be fuckin' pissed if he was there.\n\nNext, we ordered the 9 oz Grilled Lamb Burger which consists of caramelized onions with a goats cheese-feta spread & rosemary brioche bun and is served with fries & a house pickle.  The price of this burger was $21.  The waitress couldn't stop raving about how good this burger was and that she highly recommended it.  The Grilled Lamb Burger came out and honestly, there was nothing special about it.  It tasted like any regular lamb burger.  For being pricey, you'd expect it to taste amazing or at least have a wow factor to it.  Nope!  It was a huge disappointment.  We should have demanded our money back and spent it on the burgers at BurGR.  At least they were a little bit cheaper and taste amazing!\n\nThe last dish we ordered was the Pan-Seared Diver Scallops which came with steamed clams, leeks, potato-bacon chowder & confit tomatoes.  This dish was $32.  This was another dish that came out luke warm.  For being super expensive, the clams were tiny and the chowder didn't really have much flavor.  It almost tasted as though someone had forgotten to season it.  This was a huge disappointment.  It was definitely not worth the money.  While eating this dish, I bit into a small piece of the clam shell that was mixed into the chowder.  \n\nPub & Grill is Ramsay's worse restaurant in Vegas.  He needs to pay a visit there and make sure that everything is up to his standards.  Being served warm food is not acceptable unless that is how British pub food is served.  If that's the case, I do apologize in advance for talking shit.  Overall, the customer service was alright.  The food is way overpriced and it is not worth it so I don't recommend anyone going here.
