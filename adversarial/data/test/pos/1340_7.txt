I was so disappointed in this place. I went here for lunch with a friend and our waiter was extremely rude, which just kind of kills the entire point of going out and having lunch with a friend. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing to rave about.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it and I won't be back. \n\nThe only good thing about this place from my experience, is the very personable host.
