This review pertains to their happy hour specials from Sunday-Thursday, 4-5:30pm.\n\nThe Skinny: great complimentary chips and salsa and pork tortas do not take away from the surprisingly bland guacamole and greasy carnitas tacos (3) Service: bar lounge service was good but not outstanding, (3) Value: overall, an order of tortas, 2 orders of tacos, guacamole and a dessert (not on the happy hour menu) ended up being $30 - which is expensive for the level of cuisine.\n\nMy hubby was really excited to try out their happy hour and their chocolate tres leches cake. Plus the stories of tableside guacamole through Yelpers really made this place on our must-try list.\n\nWe had 2 orders of tacos (carnitas and chicken mole), tortas, guacamole, and to top it all off, a slice of chocolate tres leches.\n\nFirst the good news. Great complimentary chips with three salsa to sample - a salsa fresca, salsa verde, and a chipotle salsa. The pork tortas ($6)  were good - tender, marinated pork sandwiched in a slightly over toasted bun. The chicken mole tacos (2 tacos for $5) was well seasoned with a little Asian (?) flare to it. \n\nOkay, now the ugly. I have never had a blander guacamole ($3). During happy hour, they do not offer tableside guac... it's served directly to you so you can't adjust the flavourings. It tasted only of avocado and of little else. For three bucks, you can get a better tub of guacamole at a supermarket. Basically, don't waste your money.\n\nThe carnitas tacos (2 for $5) were rather disappointing. The meat was tough and underseasoned. Dry and greasy at the same time, the sprinkling of a watery radish salad did nothing to improve the situation.\n\nThe worst dish of the evening was the rather poor rendition of tres leches cake ($9). Tres leches cake ought to be an airy sponge cake soaking in a milky liquid - it is beautiful in its simplicity. However at Diego, the tres leches cake had an overly dry brownie consistency which made it difficult for the underlying liquid to saturate the cake. Add in some overly sweet do-dads (too sweet chocolate nibs, meringue, ice cream), the actual product had little to do with tres leches cake.\n\nOverall, some hits and misses. A three starred review.
