I went in for service for an oil change and to repair a problem with my washer fluid - it was not spraying.\n\nThey also indicated I needed new front brakes, of which I was aware.\n\nThey said the pump motor was not working and needed to be replaced. I trusted they had checked anything else it could have been like a cracked or plugged hose, a fuse, etc.\n\nThey quoted a \"seemingly\" high price to replace this motor.  I took it to another shop and it turns out the motor worked fine.  There was a crack in a hose which was repaired at NO CHARGE. I also had this shop replace the brakes for a price that was 65% lower than the brake quote from Motorcars.\n\nMotorcars Toyota blatantly lied about the washer pump not working.  This was not a simple \"mistake.\" The motor was running when the other shop inspected it - it could not be missed. Unbelievable!\n\nI was completely surprised that an established dealership would deceive and cheat.  One can only suspect it happens daily to many customers.\n\nI purchased my last two vehicles from Motorcars; however, I will not return there ever again for anything.\n\nI hope that consumers see this review.  DO NOT TRUST MOTORCARS in Cleve Hts, OH.\n\nThis is not 1 star - it is zero.
