Had planned to do their puppy training, but the orientation class was a disaster. It was a very large group - maybe 40 people and their dogs. I went with my two children (ages 11 and 8). We spent most of our time trying to keep our dog (Airedale terrier pup) sitting near us for the hour, as he was distracted by all of the other dogs (this is a class for obedience after all - we didn't expect to have to have had an already well-trained dog to attend.) When Jeff, who was running the orientation, asked if anyone had questions, we asked about how to get the dog to not pull on the leash when taking a walk. He asked my son to bring our dog up to the center of the room. I suppose he thought he would be able to immediately demonstrate his technique to the amazement of the crowd. When he couldn't get our dog to obey, he blamed it on the leash and said we should have brought him in on some special kind (no one told us about this when we signed up for the class). He then threw the leash back toward my son who missed catching it. (No idea why he couldn't have handed it to a young boy - I suppose it was out of frustration.) Our dog proceeded to take that opportunity to run around a bit, leaving my son rather embarrassed. Jeff, in a very disgusted tone, said our dog would need private lessons. Obviously we had not helped him promote his ability with dogs. We then left the class immediately as I knew we would not be working with Misty Pines.
