Please deliver to my address ASAP... (more than four miles).\n\nThis place is a take out gem. They only have 3 four tops and only 2 two seaters, so I warned you, this place is small. Customs service is fast and nice.\n\nDisclosure: I live near Great Wall and it's still my favorite traditional Chinese but I place Gourmet China II as my favorite second. \n\nI ordered Veggie Chow Fun (not on menu) and it was amazing. I ordered it spice level Medium and wow it was perfect! I love the vegetable choices of mushroom, sprouts and green onions. Perfect.\n\nI ordered tofu Pad Thai no egg and it was loaded with noodles, great flavor too!\n\nTwo thumbs up for non oily logged, fresh veggie, huge portion no shit kinda take out. I will order again ASAP. Please expand your delivery area on GrubHub ;)
