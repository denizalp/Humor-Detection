Before I start my review, please be warned, the restaurant gets full at 5:15pm on weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). You must come here before 5:30pm or you will have to wait. I have been here numerous times and I do wait occasionally, but it is never long.\n\nI have went many times to Scarborough and Brampton in Ontario, and they probably have the best south Asian cuisine in Canada (sorry Surrey, BC), but when I am in my hometown, I have to go come here.\n\nWe love everything ranging from the vegetarian menu to the chicken dishes. We absolutely love the Masala Dosa (spicy) and the Aloo Gobi. Whenever I come here, I normally eat those two dishes and I am totally full.\n\nAlthough, I also recommend the Chole, Aloo Baigan, Tikka Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Tandoori Chicken. Their basmati rice is also amazing.\n\nWaitstaff is super friendly and listens to you, that is a plus for me!\n\nBon appetit!
