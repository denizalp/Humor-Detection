I am currently attending this school.  I am impressed with the facilities and the depth of the curriculum, however, there are a couple of things about the internship that they tell you to hook you into going to that school that are a little bit exaggerated.  I would recommend checking things out for yourself rather than taking their word for it., but overall, an excellent school!
