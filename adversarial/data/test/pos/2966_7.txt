I know some people hate the whole, you have to walk through the whole floor to get to something in the end.  I don't mind, I like seeing all the furniture and stuff they have to offer plus I am super gangster with the shortcuts.   Plus I eat lots of tacos and need the exercise.  Tacos are what's up.  \n\nIKEA is always clean.   I like the items they have and that they run sales once in a while.  My wife and I went a few weekends back and got some of the free stuff they gave to the first 250 people.  Some silverware and a knife set for both of us.  Free stuff is basically my kryptonite.  I'm essentially Superman, but I'm not so fast or strong.   They also had a gift card offer a few days ago and we got $120 in gift cards for $100.  Good looking out IKEA.   And they currently are offering $25 off $150 purchase.  \n\nMy only complaint, lines get a little long sometimes and they should have another few lines open.  But they have a really good return policy and by far the craziest shopping carts.  They move in ways other shopping carts would lose their sh*t over if they knew about it.
