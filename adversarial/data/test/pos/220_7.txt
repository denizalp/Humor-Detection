Agh! I did not have the best seats for this show. I was behind a pillar and learned the hard way that \"obstructed view\" REALLY means obstructed. I suggest you do it right and plan early so you can catch more than glimpses of this fun show.\nI hope you like the Beatles, because this show is all Beatles, all the time and I LOVED IT! The soundtrack is amazing and the performers and props were beautiful and just perfect. More than once did the show have that \"Ahhhhh!\" factor. I can't wait to return and see this show the proper way (without Pillars). It's definitely worth the money and your precious Vegas time. It will make your trip for sure!
