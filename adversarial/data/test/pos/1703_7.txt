I thought it was about time for me to get a facial.  I wash my face morning and night in order to achieve nice skin, but sometimes it just isn't enough.  That's why I thought about heading over to Modella to have an extremely good wash!\n\nModella is a nice little shop that appears very clean and stylish, and smells really good.  They are decorated in black and white with an accent colour of pink, which makes it girly and very appealing.  There are a bunch of comfy chairs for the clients to sit in to have their works done.\n\nModella offers plenty of other services, as well.  You can have your nails done any way you like, get something waxed, or even have microdermabrasion.  The prices for all these jobs are listed as soon as you walk in.  Some of the stuff can be a little expensive, since most of it is priced with an & up, but I'd say it's about standard.\n\nThe only problem I saw was that I paid $70 for a facial, but didn't really feel that clean afterwards.  Maybe I'm silly, but I was hoping that my face would feel refreshed and free of all junk and guck.  Sadly, it didn't.  It just felt a little exposed and rough.  I better not get any pimples any time soon or I'm going to be pissed.\n\nFor nails and waxing, Modella is probably a great place.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for the facials, though.  For the amount that they charge here, you could go to a high class place like Swizzlesticks instead.
