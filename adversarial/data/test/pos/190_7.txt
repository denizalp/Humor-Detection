(Lyrics - The Transplants - Diamonds & Guns)\n\nSteaks going down in Bourbon & Bones\nTaking more shots for Birthday Girl\nReview looms, your food, 4 stars entombed\nWho got the Wagyu? Who gonna try some?\nWho gonna Yelp them, when the time comes?\nBourbons & Bones, Bourbons & Bones\n\n\nBourbon & Bones is a hot trendy steak house in the heart of Oldtown Scottsdale.  Swanky bar and the vibe to assure you're in for an interesting evening.  \n\nWe came for a friend birthday gathering.  Whiskey, wine, and beer was flowing, but let's jump in to the food!  We started with some oysters and calamari.  Oysters came with cocktail sauce, vinegar, and horseradish; nice bite to start!  The calamari were breaded to a crisp while the oysters were cool and slurpy; yeah no such word, but I'm making it up!  I ordered their special of the night; wedge salad, bacon wrapped filet, and ending with a creme brulee.  The wedge salad was solid well topped with blue cheese and bacon.  I ordered my filet medium which I think I should have ordered medium rare.  I found it a tad bit dry that night.  For our sides we went for the sauteed corn, roasted broccoli, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and Truffled Lobster mac and cheese.  My favorite of the bunch had to be the Truffled Lobster mac and cheese; the scent of truffle oil while the subtle cheesy bite was music to the palates.  To top it off my creme brulee was nice way to end.  Solid sugar atop a soft creamy custard.  \n\nIn the end, Bourbon & Bones has a great atmosphere for a steak dining.  I really love the service here since they were on top of it and multiple servers filling up your plate during the main course.  I didn't care for my filet, but maybe it was an off day and if I come back I'll shoot for the bone in filet; maybe that'll give it some juice.  My first whiskey came along with a fruit fly, but they were quick to replace it.  I'm not one to freak out about finding bugs in food cause it happens and will continue to happen everywhere; more protein I always say! - Enjoy!
