Whataburger was the go-to, All-American spot before In-N-Out came to Arizona. I really don't see them around any more, but to run into one that's open 24 hours was refreshing.\n\nIt's super clean\n\nEveryone is polite\n\nThe food is above average for the industry. \n\nGet the patty melt. \n\nWhoever manages this location is doing a great job. I usually say \"meh, it's just fast food\" when it comes to Yelp reviews, but if you're on the freeway late at night and want a quick bite, go here.
