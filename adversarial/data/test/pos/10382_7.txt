Shawna,\n\nYou called us 10 minutes after the technician was supposed to arrive saying they couldn't make it. \n\nThis is completely unacceptable and you know it. \n\nYour technician the last time was aggressive and like a used car salesman. I did not try to negotiate anything. I just didn't want to buy all kinds of upsell work like grout and deep cleaning.  The tactics your people use are deceptive and disingenuous.\n\nGet your facts straight before making wild accusations. \n\nYour company is horrible and you are horrible to deal with. You are ignorant in the phone and love to hang up on customers. \n\nGet over it and stop ripping people off.\n\nDisgusting.
