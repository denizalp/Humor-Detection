Personally, I would never rent from this junky junk car rental place again, but I get why people do.  Like I've said, my time is valuable, so I'm willing to pay what I've got to pay to a point. I do love value though and I will say, price was the driving force for the decision from jump, but you get what you pay for. In the end, it made for comic relief, because you really don't get to see this type of thing anywhere. \n\nWe got some sort of newish Ford that had 58K miles on it. This babe-magnet has seen a day or two in the Vegas heat. It was a ropey little thing. My man said it was like Barney Rubble was underneath the hood. So funny! \n\nThe main pain in the arse though, was returning the car. O! M! to the G! Why was it so disorganized? It took like 45 minutes to check out. No distinguishable lines. Who's renting a car? Who's returning a car? Total chaos. To the point you're looking at people who work there who aren't helping customers and saying to yourself \"wtf? can you help me?\" It was like being at what I assume a welfare office would be like.  It was unreal. \n\nThe \"airport shuttle\" was another bag of fun. Finally we get on the shuttle, and the driver randomly drops off two korean ladies in sun hats off at CVS. What? It was like a bad movie! Without missing a beat, we are back rolling again.  We pull up to what looks like some sort of station, to be told to get off, go across the street, find someone with a green vest, who will then tell us which shuttle to get onto for the airport. Are you joking? I couldn't stop laughing. \n\nIt's cheap because you pay for it in stress. Which eventually turns into laughing, it's so unorganized and crazy.
