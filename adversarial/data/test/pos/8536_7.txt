I have been coming to this salon for a couple years. I have always had amazing service with my hairstylist Helen. Recently, the salon was sold to the same people that owns Jacksons Bar and Grill on Flamingo. \n\nDuring my recent visit some questionable products were being sold that no longer make this place a family friendly hair salon. They began selling a product for breast hygiene. The location of this product was situation right at the entrance where customers pay, and as if that was not offensive enough, I was asked if I wanted to purchase this new \"hygiene for breasts and other areas.\" I asked this staff member if she thought maybe I smelled funny, and she nervously answered that she is required by the new owners to sell two a day to keep her job! I personally thought she was kidding, but she explained that she has been purchasing several a week and donated them just to maintain job security. \n\nThis is no way to run a business! I am so glad I didn't have my son with me that day.
