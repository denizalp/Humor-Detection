I don't usually come here to order the salmon sashimi or the california roll. If I did, I'd probably give a slightly above average rating of 3.5 stars as well because to be honest, it's hard to make those things stand out. If you would like to try something truly unique, please tolerate the higher price point and order yourself one of the Chef Specials. They are an assortment of sashimi, all arranged beautifully at the chef's discretion. Because it is up to the chef's selection and creativity, every order is unique. \n\nThe first time my family ordered one of these Chef Specials, I had the fortune of trying an unidentified piece of thick white and pink sashimi that melted in my mouth like nothing I've ever experienced before. That was the first time I've tried O-Toro...or tuna belly, arguably the most expensive of all sashimi delicacies. Surrounding it were succulent pieces of fatty salmon belly, chewy conch meat (in its original shell), sweet scallop, and fresh sea urchin. I wasn't familiar with a lot of the fish selections that were chosen and to be honest, I didn't know what I was eating half the time. Doesn't matter, it was ALL delicious. \n\nThe second and last time I've ordered the Chef Special, they had lobster tail and a whole fish. That's right, a fish that was about the size of a small hand, with its meat carved out and the rest of the fish (head, bone, tail) decorating the edge of the plate. They later took the fish and deep fried it so that we could enjoy the rest of it in all its crispy delight. \n\nIt was these two one-of-a-kind experiences that have really solidified Ichiban as a great sushi place in my mind that is well-deserving of its slightly higher price point. I've tried their other dishes before, like their rolls and sushi\/sashimi platters and boats. As others have pointed out, they're not bad. But if you are feeling a little adventurous, my suggestion is to save up a bit of money, come here on a special occasion, and order something that truly stands out.\n\n(13\/100) - 2016
