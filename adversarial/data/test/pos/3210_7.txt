Really impressed with Flywheel and happy that a spin class opened up close to home! It's opening weekend so they are offering free classes and that doesn't count as your free class you get as a new customer. So really that means two free classes! It's a stadium style seating class complete with great music and a motivating insutrctor. This is your basic spin clsss but hat I really like is that they have lockers with private showers and all the amenities ou need so if you need to go to work after class you won't smell. Classes are on the pricey end, $28 a class. I wish they were more reasonably priced so I could go once a week but I'm hoping they start to offer some sort of deal. The membership is pricey too. At any rate I'll be sure to try to go at least once a month. The customer service gets an A+. I've never met a peppier bunSo happy they opened!
