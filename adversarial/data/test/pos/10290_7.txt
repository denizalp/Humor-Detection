We came here on a business\/pleasure trip as Dude had to do business while I tagged along to go shopping, have dinner with friends and enjoy the meals.  I reminded Dude to put me on the hotel room check in since he was going to be working so he did and we preregistered for check in and the hotel responded that he would get an email to say the room would be available.  Resort fee only includes free internet, phone calls and fitness center.\n\nSo I arrived at the hotel and checked in my bag at the bell desk.  As check in was at 3 pm, I texted Dude to find out if he received an email about the check in but he never responded.  So I went into the check in line after 3 pm and it was long but went rather quickly as every reservation station was being utilized.  Check in was smooth; however, Dude had reserved a room in the West Wing and I got rather confused on where to find it because I went to the elevators for The Grand Tower and West Wings floors 4 and up, but couldn't find the West Wing, Floor 3, Room 528.  Finally I asked a person from the concierge, who happened to be walking around when I was bewildered, where the West Wing, floor 3 was.  She walked me to where it was located.  It is a narrow hallway between The Crush Bar and the high roller area.  From there, you use your room key to go through a door, through a long dingy low ceiling hallway, which goes on forever.  Then you find the elevator to the 3rd floor.  Once I got to the 3rd floor, I had to walk another long hallway to get to my room.  The hallways and low ceilings reminded me of a dormitory.  \n\nOnce I got to my room, I was surprised there were no windows, like I was underwater on a cruise ship with no portals to look out of.  Then I realized that this room in the West Wing was far far away from the casino and the things I enjoy doing, like working out at the Fitness Center or going to the pool.  \n\nSpeaking of the fitness center which is located in the spa and salon, it is fabulous for us gym rats on vacay!  It is huge, with a variety of machines, has a water fill up station, towels, free weights area and a stretch area with stability and medicine balls as well as free weights!  \n\nLater that evening, when Dude and I returned to the hotel, he went to a separate line at the front desk for checked in guests and asked them if we could change rooms because of the room being far away and me not being happy.  We were lucky that the manager was sympathetic to his request as Dude said \"he would be in the dog house with me\".  We were quickly changed to a older room in the Grand Tower with a view of the roof and Mandalay Bay, my favorite hotel.\n\nI have stayed in the MGM before the lion was removed at the entrance, many years ago and haven't stayed here since.  It still is a huge hotel to walk through and I'm glad we were able to get a room in the Grand Tower, that wasn't guaranteed so good customer service at the front desk and smooth check in.  However, the MGM needs to update their rooms in the Grand Tower to keep up with other hotels.  They have a sign in the bathroom about conserving water by hanging up your towels to reuse; however, there is a fridge which has drinks inside but you have to pay for them. The safe is hidden in one of the drawers of the nightstand which is totally unexpected\n\nIf you don't mind walking or having no view no window,  \"West Wing\" between The Crush and high roller area is your spot to reserve.  I, however, have other hotels to compare with and I prefer to stay elsewhere on future trips.  We only stayed here to be close to our friends, who are staying here.
