Very cool location, awesome views, awesome service, and I actually didn't pay for valet so not sure why others stated they did. \nThe drawbacks.... It's expensive, drinks, food and portions were good but not spectacular, and the bar table we sat at was way too small and barley fit our three plates of food.  \nTip- chorizo nachos! \nTip- steer clear of the cucumber Marg. no bueno!
