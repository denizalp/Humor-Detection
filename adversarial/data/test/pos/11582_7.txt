This place personifies LA to me, and not just because it has two of their chain restaurants. Adding in a bunch of different Fred Segal boutiques every 500 yards doesn't help, but as others have mentioned, there seem to be a whole lot of staff doing a whole lot of nothing.\n\nThe gambling floor is clean, the floorplan is simple (and hasn't changed from the Sahara days), and I appreciate that they have a gallery but find it telling that their buffet has closed, their restaurants have cut their hours, and I can always find parking in the first row I turn into. This place is not a hotspot even when visiting on weekends, for better or worse.\n\nOddly though, I find myself returning- not for Umami or Griddle Caf√©, but I actually like the low-key atmosphere. The coffee bar isn't bad either, and their higher-end restaurants seem to be executing on the appropriate level. But no one can afford to open a casino on the Strip (even the end of it) and not get more business than this.
