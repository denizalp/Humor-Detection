Five guys burger patties are juicy, fatty, cheese-melty AND placed on buns that are soft, fluffy, absorbent and a little sweet. IMO, the taste of this thing is unmatched by no other joint. Nothing fancy. No gimmicks. Just tasty.\n\nThe \"small\" fries can feed, um, \"five guys\". Eat one serving by yourself though and it will raise your cholesterol to 900. Get the diet coke. No, wait, that won't work.
