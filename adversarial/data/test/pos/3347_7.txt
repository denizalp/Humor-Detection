Love this salon!  No complaints here, very fast and efficient, they do not waste your time:)  Ashley (Lori's assistant) was great at shampooing my hair as I lay back on a massaging chair with a warm towel around my neck.  Lori was an excellent hair stylist with a less than 30 minute classic blowout that blew me away;)  Kaylee did an awesome job with my make-up, the airbrush was so light and evened out my acne filled skin.  The smoky eyes with fake eyelashes truly made my eyes pop out.  She even gave me a sample for the lipstick and extra cotton swabs for finishing touches.  All in all, well worth it because you're worth it:) Standing ovation to the Salon at Aria!
