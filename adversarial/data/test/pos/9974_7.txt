Tasty is Pittsburgh's BEST kept secret for Cantonese cuisine. If you're Chinese and miss your mum's cooking, this is the place to go!!! The service is fast, the food is cheap and they serve you gummies to end of the meal! Did I mention that there's a designated parking lot right infront of the store?\n\nDon't order the American standards of General Tso's and Moo Goo Gai Pan , unless you REALLY want to. This is the place to get really authentic home cooked food. Order the steam ground pork, or steam ground pork with egg, the tofu, veggie and mushroom dish on the special menu written in Chinese( second from the right), the cold steamed chicken with ginger, or the chicken with mushroom, or the pork chop with pepper sauce, or the shrimp with egg and the list goes on. \n\nIf you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!). And they will arrange the tables nicely, and cover them up with some festive table cloth. The owners are also really accomodating with regards to changing the menu at short notice and special requests. If you need to refrigerate a cake, they will gladly oblige. They do not serve alcohol, its a BYOB place. The BEST part, a ten course dinner for 11 people will set you back about $120 or so including tax and tip (menu included roast duck and lobster)!  \n\nMy husband and I have been eating at this little hole in the wall for years now and we are really going to miss it when we move.  The owners are really nice and the food is great!
