Here comes yet another player in the ever thickening Toronto burger market. Just south of Yonge and St. Clair on the west side of Yonge, Retro Burger is a fast-food style burger shop that's so orange, nothing rhymes with it.\n\nTheir menu offers 5oz beef burgers, hot dogs, chicken burgs (and souvlaki), fish (on a bun or with fries), philly cheese steaks, poutines and if you're feeling stupid: green or garden salad. As I'm currently dabbling in vegetarianism, I opted for the Veggie Burger combo for $7. It's a decent amount of food and the skin-on fries are actually pretty solid (especially with the shakers of seasoning). But the veg-burg was not nearly the best I've had and in this burger-filled town, you gotta bring it.\n\nThat said, there are so many options on the menu, including an intriguing \"Big 10 Belly Buster Burger\" (it's double the meat, bacon and cheese) and a feta poutine that could be all right. I'll give this place another shot when I'm back on the meat bus.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: RETRO Burgers won't make HISTORY.\n\nMenu Readability: Very retro type on an oh-so-orange background. Bon!\n\nNeed to mention: One of their bottles contains \"Retro Sauce\" a combo of BBQ and mayo and nostalgia.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I never want to ride on anything called a Meat Bus.
