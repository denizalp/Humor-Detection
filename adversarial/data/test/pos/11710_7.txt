Peter A. review of wildhorse pass casino inspired me to write a review for the the nightclub inside the casino. i totally forgot to review this place.\n\nalthough this place is a classy looking nightclub the drinks are definitely overpriced and to add insult to injury the bartenders were rude when taking our order.  the space is not used effectively. the issue is that there is no place for folks to hang out if they are not dancing so they end up standing in the middle of the dance floor which makes it impossible to dance. \n\nwhat i did like was that it's inside a nice casino, right of the I-10, valet parking, free parking and the music was very good.
