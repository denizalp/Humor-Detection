OK, first things first. If you are a local and have not started hanging out Downtown yet, then all I have to ask is \"WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!?\" Hurry up and get your booty down here. It's pretty much the business.\n\nSecondly, you need to make a trip to this sweet spot. Especially if you are a musician or someone who loves music. This place screams \"rocker chic.\"\n\nFrom the vinyl on the walls to the amp cases used as bar stools, you gotta appreciate the effort and cool sophistication in design at this bar.\n\nYou gotta go when Danny is working. He was super nice, took care of me, and was really excited about the place. He made sure I had a great time! He even gave me the grand tour of their super-secret, super amazing hidden back room.... Pretty swanky if ya ask me.\n\nIt was slow while I was there (Monday night), but they had a pretty cool special going on: I got a mug of PBR on tap and a large shot of rail whiskey for $6. Not tasty in the least, but you will be pretty good to go afterward lol.\n\nApparently, they are also building a large music venue next door. So keep an eye out for future awesome live bands in the near future. I can't wait!!\n\nPS- This place also has pretty much the best doorman this side of I-15. Shout out to White Boy Tim!! I see you, baby!! LOL!
