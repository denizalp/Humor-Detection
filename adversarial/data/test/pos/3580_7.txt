The ONLY reason I am giving hook 4 stars is because the wings are that good! The restaurant is EXTREMELY gross looking! The only reason why I went there is because of the wings. I stop going because it got to the point where I had force myself not to look at the floor because I was scared I was going to see a \"pest\" run around. The people working there are just like the restaurant... disgusting! The last time I went there the guy trying (I said trying because I walked out immediately) to take my order was cleaning his nails with a paper clip. ... I'm getting sick just thinking about it. \n\nThey have the best wings I have ever tasted but its not worth it if you are worried a roach might end up in your food.
