Had lunch at Boba Hut a couple of weeks ago because I was hearing a lot of good things. And i have to agree that it is good Chinese restaurant with some Hawaii-style options.\n\nI do want to start with that I grew up in HI and so when I'm searching for comfort food, I want what I had from the manapua truck or working in Honolulu. So I'm not being snooty about this, but if someone from HI is reading this, I just want to set realistic expectations.\n\nI ordered chow fun which was typical of a Chinese restaurant, good, but not Hawaiian-style where you have the fish cake and char siu in it. I also had the crispy gau gee which was almost as good as the HI famous Waimalu Chop Suey, but not as thick.\n\nWhile I was there, I loved the amount of order pick ups from Uber and GrubHub. So I know I'll be ordering from here because of the convenience.\n\nFOR THE OWNER\nHope the owner or management still reviews Yelp because I have some helpful information for you:\n1. It may be because it was lunch time, but I do have to say that the wait time was a little too long. I thought it was me, but I timed how long it took a woman and her child to get their lunch and it was over 10-minutes.\n2. Pork Hash in HI is a large pork shumai! I made a mistake once at another Chinese restaurant and ordered pork hash. When it came out, it was just ground pork. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed. So when I asked your counter-help, she confirmed that the Pork Hash plate you have listed is ground pork patty. I kindly let the counter-help know, that in HI, when someone orders Pork Hash, it is pork shumai that we expect. \n\nIf you can get the chow fun and the pork hash right, I would be so grateful.
