Vegan Mexican with a urban funk to it. Should it work?  I dont know. Did it work?  Not really.\n\nWe walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.\n\nThe menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.\n\nWe ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. \n\nOur tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1\/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.\n\nThe tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy.\n\nThe next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter\/cook is.   \n\nSo I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out.
