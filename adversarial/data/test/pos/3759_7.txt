Just about every weekend this Super 8 is sold-out! Why, you ask? Because it is inexpensive, convenient, has a free Airport shuttle, is near the Airport, and all the airline personnel and flight crews crash there between flights.\n\nThis Super 8 Koval is the LARGEST Super 8 in all the country. It seems to wrap around a very large city block very near the Strip, but far enough away from the garish neon lights and parade of drunken lechers that it feels somewhat serene there!\n\nThe pool is small and squished in next to the back parking lot but it is clean and the cool pool water was very refreshing on a hot Las Vegas day. Super 8 Koval even has a little outdoor cabanna area-complete with lush couches and chairs. I kind of felt that a lot of the hotel's male workers who trundle by with carpeting or construction equipment get an extra bonus from their job by the sight of so many bikined bodies getting fried in the withering dessert sun!\n\nThe rooms themselves are not bad either. Although there was an ever-present smell of stale paint fumes in the hallways, I was okay with everything except there the lack of conditioner or body moisturizer to go with the complimentary bottle of shampoo in the bathroom. EXCELLENT CELL PHONE RECEPTION! No dropped calls-probably because of the enormous cell phone tower that sits in the back of the huge Super 8 parking lot in the back!\n\nPersonnel are friendly and gracious; however some front desk employees are much more helpful then others. A gentlemen in the morning hooked me up with a great tour and whipped out his cell phone to call & make sure the driver was on his way. Later on, some grumpy female front desk employees just waved a brochure in my face when I asked about a city tour. \n\nBest part about this Super- Ellis Island Casino right next door. $7.99 steak dinners and a Metro Pizza outlet that serves the best greasy but delicous pizza at all hours-day and night,  Right next door to Ellis is a 7\/11 where I could go get coffee and cold drinks first thing in the morning.\n\nIt is possible to go to Vegas and enjoy yourself while watching your wallet. There is no need to deny yourself the pleasure of a little va-cay to Sin City if you're poor or not some high-rolling playa. It just takes knowing where to go and how to do it. Keep this Suoer 8 in mind next time your travels take you to the Neon Capitol of Gaudyville!
