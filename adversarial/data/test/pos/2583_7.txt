IN YOUR MOUTH T.O.!\nToronto has a mad foodie scene! And here's WHY ...\n\nBeing a semi-newbie in town, I had never been to Marben Restaurant and only learned of chef Misha Nestreneko's upcoming departure from the Toronto dining scene only a few days ago. So needless to say, I was excited to sample some of this renowned chef's creations!\n\nHaving been here for only a few months, I have already been fortunate to attend some amazing food events downtown. Enter: Ken Samuel from In Your Mouth TO! One of Toronto's prevalent social media contributors in food & dining, Ken's events are top notch, always taking place at fabulous settings, and consistently offering an appetizing set menu. What's more, his events not only brings foodies together, but the set up is such a way that it encourages meeting and chatting with everyone that attends. Every event involves personalized and creative name tags, followed by various games, usually involving trivia questions pertaining to the event, via twitter. Only one person always walks away with the grand prize, but everyone leaves smiling from ear-to-ear!\n\nAnd tonight was no different! Tonight we feast! In collaboration with Great Lakes Brewery, the main feature is the succulent roasted pig with homemade BBQ sauce, paired with a handful of side dishes, and various types of Canadian beer, \"The Crazy Canuck\" being the one we sampled at our table. This is a west coast pale ale with an aroma that has a bit of bounce, a lingering bitterness and balanced by a subtle malty flavour. C'mon Canucks! Let's support the Great White North!\n\nPOSH NOSHINGS\n\nWho would think of eating roasted pig in such divine surroundings? Marben Restaurant! That's who! The venue was tucked away downstairs, where the toasty coloured brick walls and plushy red velvet banquet seating along the parameters made for a cozy, intimate, and stylish setting. \n\nALL ABOUT ... THE PIG ROAST!\n\nJuicy, meaty, and dripping in it's own fat and oils, the roasted pig was succulent, flavourful and simply, delish! It was recommended by Andrew at the next table to dip the freshly baked bread with the roasted pig juices and top it with chunks of fatty pork pieces. Result? mmm, mmm, and mmm!\n\nSide dishes that complimented the roasted pork were very creative:\n\nKimchi Apple Salad - with toasted cashews, house fermented cabbage\n\nBraised Kale - with yukon gold potatoes, pork drippings\n\nBaked Beans - with cranberry beans, smoked pork\n\nKennebec Fries - with truffle aioli, ketchup\n\nCreamy Coleslaw - with grainy mustard, sunflower seeds\n\nWith a full array of tastes from spicy, sweet, salty, and smooth, the side dishes paired wonderfully well with the roasted pig and induced all of your taste buds!\n\nWAVE YOUR HANDS ... TO CHEF MISHA!\n\nAnd finally, to chef Misha Nestreneko, we bid you farewell! Though he has parted from the T-Dot, you can still enjoy the culinary legacy he has left behind! \n\nTwo words, GET HERE!
