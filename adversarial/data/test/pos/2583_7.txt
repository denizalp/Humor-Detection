My family and I always come here after eating at Ping Pang Pong. It's been our ritual lately, I don't know why. \n\nGet their Strawberry or Mango shaved ice. Trust me, and you'll thank me later. The portions are humongous, enough to feed 4-5 people. It literally looks like a volcano, and it's super refreshing and perfect for this hot ass weather. \n\nService is always quick and efficient. The people at the cashier are friendly and accommodating. We'll probably be back in the next week or two.
