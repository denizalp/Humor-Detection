The Touch of European Cafe is a quaint little place in one of those old homes that have been converted into a business just off the Historic Glendale square.  This place is locally owned by a couple of immigrants from Poland. They offer fantastic tasting Polish food and have exceptional customer service.   \n\nNow, I'm not a \"beet\" person so when I was asked to sample their red borscht-beet soup I was apprehensive to the point of making a grimmest face. But to my surprise it was delicious! We ordered some soup de jour, pierogi's both cheese and smoke sausage with onions for apps.  These pierogi's were amazing!  The best I've had in quite some time.  \n\nSince it was lunch we opted away from the delicious looking Polish Plate Specials and went for their gourmet sandwiches.  We had their Fresh Mozzarella, basil and tomato on cibatta bread toasted with their vinaigrette dressing.  It was very fresh and tasty. We also had a smoked polish sausage on a cibatta bun with their sauerkraut-slaw and mustard.  It too was very good and huge! We had to take half of it to-go. They have a lot of homemade deserts to choose from including Cheese Blintzes and Kolaczki Cookies, which we had both the apricot and raspberry ~ delish!!\n\nThe Touch of European Cafe is very small and popular so you may need to call ahead of time when dinning indoors for dinner.  They have outdoor seating which is perfect for dinning for lunch of dinner when the weather is nice. They are BYOW so you can bring your own favorite bottle of wine!  \n\nWe are looking forward to our next visit, this time it will be dinner.  Planning to bring a nice bottle of Pinot Noir to go with either some Hunter Stew or some Stuffed Cabbage Rolls along with a side of pierogi's of course!  I might even have their soup de jour again!
