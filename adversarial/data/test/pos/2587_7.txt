There are a few dive bars in Phoenix that turn me on... Central Phoenix to be specific...\n\nTHIS IS ONE OF THEM !!!\n\nIt's comfortable, there are pretty people and there are ugly people. \n\nThe bartenders remember my drinks, and well, I think I get heavy pours because I rarely have more then 2-3 drinks and always leave pleasantly buzzed. \n\nYAY SWIZZLE !!
