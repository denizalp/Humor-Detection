Avoid at all cost!!\n\nJust came back from it with a group of 7 and I have to say it was the WORST DINING EXPERIENCE ever!\n\nFood was terrible and all tasted the same.\n\nThe tables were placed so close together that you are literally touching the people sitting behind you. \n\nThe menu was only in Chinese so you would assume they would speak Chinese but they refuse to answer to you in Chinese although they can understand you.\n\nTerrible service and just lack general etiquette. We ordered 20 skewers, 15 spicy and 5 non-spicy. They brought them out together on the same plate with the spicy ones on top of the non-spicy. Also, they will not bring you drinks. You have to get up, fight through the crowded chairs and sea of people, to get your own.\n\nParking lot fits 4 cars and was a nightmare getting in and out. I ended up parking on the residential street around the block. \n\nI think I saw 4 or 5 workers in the restaurant, servers and cashiers, and I have not seen one smile from any of them through out dinner.\n\nEntire restaurant is covered with smell of lamb and that stuff will linger on your clothes long after you leave the restaurant.\n\nTo top it all of, they only take cash but nowhere in their store do they tell people this until you go to pay with your credit card.\n\nAll in all, it was the worst dining experience of my entire life and would not wish this restaurant on my worst enemies.
