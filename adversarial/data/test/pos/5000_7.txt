Bar+Bistro I so wanted to give you a better rating, but alas I cannot.\n\nI met up with a friend here last night to watch three bands play. The last band, being from Alabama and consisting of a guitar player, washtub bass, snare drum player (yes just one drum), and a girl who switched up playing a washboard and a saw (yes, a saw), made my experience here be bumped up to two stars, otherwise I would have given the place a 1-star rating for last night.\n\nBar+Bistro is on its way to being a cool, hip place to eat and hang out. Unfortunately, it has its hiccups. So let me start off by saying, I did enjoy my food, it was good and I can tell someone is putting care into making it. Moving on...\n\nI ordered the Mahi Mahi Tacos, my friend ordered the fries. The fries came out first and then quickly after, my tacos. The fries were good, my tacos were good. But it ends there. The tacos came as a \"make it yourself\" platter, which is a fun thing to do. However, I just kept thinking, \"I could go down the street to Tacos El Gordo and have FIVE awesome tacos for less money than I'm spending now AND I wouldn't have to make them myself\". That's just where my mind wanders I guess.\n\nMy biggest complaint of the night: the bartenders. I've stated before that chick bartenders piss me off and tonight the case was in full swing. There were two bartenders working that night, both ladies, both with dark hair. I walked up to a bar that was half full, pulled out my money and ID (because I always get ID'd) and stood there, obviously looking like I wanted to order. I proceeded to make eye contact with both of the bartenders many times. Finally, one came by and said she'd be \"right with me\". \"Thanks\" I replied back. She then proceeded to walk around the bar again. \n\nAt this point two older gentleman walked up to the bar yelling pleasantries at the bartender. She walks up to them, chats, and then serves them........... BEFORE ME. \n\nI was so irritated by this point I just pointed to the beer in the hand of one of the guys beside me and she walked off and got me my beer. Since I already had $3 in my hand I just gave her the money and walked off. She should not have gotten a tip from me at all.\n\nSo, I want to like Bar+Bistro, I really do. The al fresco dining is awesome, but with staff treating customers so poorly it is hard for me to want to go back.\n\nEDIT: Sometimes my bias of bartenders gets the best of me. But just so everyone knows, the bartenders at Bar+Bistro are very nice and even contacted me via Yelp about my experience. I am going back to Bar+Bistro and I am certainly hoping for a better experience. I think it will definitely be better in the next go round. :)
