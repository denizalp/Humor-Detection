I was in market for a new washer and dryer, went into store and found what I needed. The sales people were great and there was no pressure to buy anything. I was approved for their credit program so I decided to get a new television also. All went well with purchase and delivery. \n\nTwo weeks later.....the tv goes out and I call to the store and was rudely told I need to contact their repair service department which I did and now three weeks later here I am without a working tv and waiting on a part to come in and Lord knows how much longer until the person can come out to repair. Who has ever heard of a store that doesn't stand behind their product and just replace the merchandise? \n\nI have received horrible service from the store manager who said \"well what do you want me to do I don't have any power\", to the repair department who says \"it's not my problem\". If I could have done it all again I would have never purchased a thing from this company because I feel as if I have been subject of a con scheme. All I wanted was for a replacement to be issued but because of their \"policies\" and unwritten \"policies\" all I have been left with is a headache. If I could have rated this company a negative zero I most certainly would have. I pray my washer and dryer lasts. This company lacks integrity to take care of their customers and customer service is sorely lacking. I will be paying off my account and I will never buy another thing from them again. Buyer beware!!!!
