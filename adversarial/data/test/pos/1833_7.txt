Shauna is a liar and an EXTREMELY passive aggressive money hungry woman. I messaged them on Instagram about my horrible lash job by Heather to be ignored, but the second I write a bad yelp review they're begging me to take it down! I was wondering how there was only one other bad review! All the while, trying to act like it's MY fault they messed up my lashes. I needed a mixed fill last minute & everywhere was booked. I always wanted to try Sassy. I came in with ONLY CLASSICS. The lash artist even commented on how well my previous artist did. All the volume fans that are on my eyes, are from sassy lashes! First off, if you can't get down proper isolation, you should just entirely quit lashing! My volume fans are a glued up MESS and ripping out 2-3 even FOUR natural lashes each time one fan falls out! (PICS BELOW) These are ruining my natural lashes and causing them all to fall out due to the heaviness. It's been exactly 8 days and this is the WORST retention I've ever had in my life. Practically all my lashes have fallen out so I have to go to my regular lash artist tomorrow and have her remove this glued together mess and fix it! Obviously the first 3 days they looked okay, which is their \"grace period\" that they'll fix for free. Usually I go 2-3 weeks between fills and ONE week later I look WORSE than a 3 week full. Sucks I have to spend another $100 a week later. I really really wanted to love this place! They looked great the few days after, but so quickly they fell apart. Also weird they don't accept debit? How can you charge $200+ for full sets and $70+ for fills but not even own a debit card reader? I even own a debit card reader. They're inexpensive... I can not believe I paid them $70 plus tip so this woman could glue my lashes together. \nThey offered ONLY if I took my yelp review down to have a different artist at their lounge \"fix\" my lashes for free. Hahaha. You couldn't pay me to further damage my lashes here. Shauna handles thing extremely poorly and texted me defensive af, and trying to act like this is somehow NOT their fault. I'm convinced the only girls who have positive experiences at Sassy have never had their lashes done anywhere else, and know absolutely nothing about how good lash extensions should feel and look.
