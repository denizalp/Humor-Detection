It's 1 am, you are just coming down from a terrific high and you are ready for some doughnuts.  Where do you go?  This place!  Me and three of my friends once went here and ordered two dozen doughnuts.  We ate them all on the way home!\nMy first purchase from this place was a humongous apple turnover in 1976.  It was after a Kansas concert.  I have been going back ever since.  The doughnuts continue to be as good as ever.
