New name, new look, higher prices. Pizza and wings were good before, and they still are. Burgers and chicken Philly nothing special.  \n\nPrices are inflated for a product that doesn't warrant it. \n\nLike I said, the pizza and wings are still great,  but $80 bucks for two kids meals, two sandwiches, two lemonades, two beers, and a mixed drink does not make a neighborhood place that I will return to.
