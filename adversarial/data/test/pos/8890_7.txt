I stumbled upon Barrelhouse when doing a Yelp search for dinner in Chandler. It came up towards the top of the list, and for good reason.  I've eaten here twice now for dinner, and both occasions I was thoroughly impressed.  The service is excellent... prompt, friendly, informative without being overbearing or hovering.  The interior of the restaurant is budget modern, but it has charm and a dark ambiance that is perfectly matched to the menu.  The location of the restaurant is unassuming, tucked away in an oddly old strip mall in Chandler.  But anyhow, the real reason for the 5 star rating is the food.\n\nEvery single bite I've had at Barrelhouse was perfect.  To start, try the BBQ kettle chips and dip.  They are enormous house-made chips with a flavorful garlic cheese dip... highly addictive!  From the small plates, I've tried the chorizo sliders, seared ahi tuna, and bruschetta.  All were excellent, but I keep coming back to the chorizo sliders.  For entrees, the white truffle mac n cheese is an indulgence I can get used to.  It is worth every single calorie.  The pot roast is also excellent.\n\nPrices are reasonable considering the quality and portions.  The bar is also well stocked, and features many signature cocktails and a nice draft beer selection with some local brews.  Try Barrelhouse if you're in the Phoenix area, you will not be disappointed!
