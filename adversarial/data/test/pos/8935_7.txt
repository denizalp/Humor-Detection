I feel like this was Charlotte's original ice cream shop, so I had been meaning to give it a try. I'm a sucker for the unique flavors at Two Scoops and Golden Cow though so it took me a while to make it here. \n\nWe had lunch in the area and decided to stop by after. It's a small shop with a bar that has a few seats. You can park on the street right outside. \n\nThey have a good selection of flavors. While not quite as creative as some of the newer shops in town, they still have a good variety that you don't find at your average ice cream shop. \n\nThey only let you sample three flavors which is a little annoying when there are so many to choose from. I decided to go with the cake batter and the pralines and cream. Both were very good. Everyone else I was with also enjoyed the flavors they got. \n\nI got a regular with the two scoops which were a little small. I definitely wanted more when I was done!\n\nThis is a good little ice cream shop that I definitely recommend checking out if you're in the area.
