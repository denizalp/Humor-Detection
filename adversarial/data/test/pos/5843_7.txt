Thank goodness someone told the truth about Fillaseat. All they have posted on the site for Las Vegas is comedy shows.  I don't think they are even trying to get good shows, sporting events, and or concerts to attend.  I'm kind of irritated and feel like I wasted my money. What a disappointment.\n\nHeard other competitors is the better deal if you are shopping around.  Unless you like tons of local comedians, Fillaseat may not be for you.
