Steve Wynn delivers top notch hotel luxury (Vegas style) with the Bellagio. \nHaving stayed at The Venetian, Cosmopolitan, Vdara, The Palms and Aria, I was quite happy with my experience at the Bellagio. \nCheck-in was a breeze. I was meeting up with friends at the Aria next door and inquired about a room close to the Tram. This is a really wonderful way to get to City Center. My room in the spa tower was perfect for not only this, but also for my visit to the spa the following day. Contemporary furnishings, light and shade panel on the wall (brilliant!) and a very comfortable bed made my stay top notch. Unlike the rest of Vegas, you'll never experience the smokers smell walking anywhere on the property. While the lobby and public areas are whimsical and over the top, the rooms stay classy and understated. It's easy to avoid douchebaggery here. It would have been great to spend more time in my room, but It's Vegas- if you're spending too much time in your room consider reducing the gourmand and increasing the gourmet. \nPro-tip: Email the concierge to arrange for special things prior to arrival. I set up a spa day for me and my wonderful friend who was celebrating her birthday that weekend. Ruby Banuelos was beyond excellent and beyond responsive. I've never experienced a better concierge in any hotel! Thanks Ruby.
