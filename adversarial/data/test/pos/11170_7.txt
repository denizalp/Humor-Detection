Do I really want to share this man?\n\nDavid is the owner of Hair America.  Top notch hairstylist extraordinaire...seriously!  I have been going to David for over 7 years now.\nI was done with the whole snooty salon atmosphere.  Don't look at me up and down, then ask me if I want something done with my hair!  WTF?  Sorry, I had to vent.  \nWhen you're calling for an appointment, you talk to David.  If you're happy with the service, talk to David.  If you're unhappy, not because of his work, you call David.  Need a psychologist?  You guessed it...well, if you have a great hairstylist, they can be anything.\nOh, my hair.  Yes, he does an extraordinary job with my cascading dark brown hair, red hair, blonde highlights, caramel streaks, purple and magenta...okay, I get bored easily!   He always cater to any hairstyle I want. \nHe is a one man show.   He gets pretty busy unless you call a few weeks ahead of time.  If you're looking for a blingy, snooty, uppity, superficial salon...don't call him.
