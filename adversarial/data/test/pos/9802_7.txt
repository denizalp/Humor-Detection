The East End's Silk Elephant has a worthy opponent in Angkor.\n\nTo think I first learned of fish cakes from a Conan The Barbarian comic book I read as a lad. No, I don't recall the issue number. \n\nAt Angkor, you get 5 to an order of this appetizing appetizer. The diminutive discs come with a medley of wonderfully sweet pickled onions and a cucumber sauce. The filler is minimal; the flavor is anything but. \n\nKay had the Ban Chhev (a large yellow crepe that looked like an omelete) for dinner (please write a review, baby doll).  I had the Shrimp Penang and found it to be favorably reminiscent of the Duck Curry I had at Silk Elephant (I'm assuming them to be the same dish aside from the choice of meat). A roll call of ingredients from the menu is in order: Thai basil, peas, green peppers, red peppers, dried red chili, lemon grass, shallots, garlic, galanga, kaffir lime leaves, and coconut milk. All of the components added up to the sum of their parts, making for a remarkably rich yet racy recipe of rapturous proportions that I barely finished. \n\nChalk it up to losing my sanity, but I detected a slight licorice flavor. As for the shrimp, they were plump and plentiful in number, but the Penang was so good, I might have been able to eat it sans any meat at all. \n\nAngkor's extensive dessert menu sounded as intriguing as the tracklisting for an upcoming studio album from your all-time favorite band. Some of the names included Golden Threads, Jack Fruit Seeds, Golden Balls (don't. go. there...), Sang Khaya Khatt, Rainbow Cake, Banana Steamed Cake, Squash Custard, Black Sweet Rice, and Avocado Ice Cream. \n\nAlas, Treats & Sweets nearby was calling us for a return visit, so partake we did not, but we will definitely return, if for no other reason than to see what Black Sweet Rice is all about. \n\nP.S. I can honestly tell you that we had no problems whatsoever with the service at Angkor, something that reviewers here on Yelp and elsewhere allegedly had issues with.
