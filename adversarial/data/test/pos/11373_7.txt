On our last day, after checking out of the craptastic Flamingo, we proceeded to check right into the Palms. Why, you ask? Tired, fatigued and partied out, we needed some rest, and our flight didn't leave until 11pm. Fail. So we attempted to cruise the strip for the day, but lost steam around noon.\n\nWe checked for cheap hotels that we could book for the \"night\", essentially to nap in before we had to leave, and saw that the Palms was a whopping $60 for a Monday. !!! How could we pass that up? \n\nThe only reason I've never considered staying at the Palms is its out-of-the-way location. Off the strip has always been a no-go in my opinion, but in this case, it was worth it, given that we were just planning to sleep.\n\nWe got there and were PISSED we hadn't stayed there the whole time. It's young, hot, fun and stylish. The people in the hotel actually looked like US, not like middle aged out of towners in Disney t-shirts and fanny packs. \n\nI couldn't sleep, so I decided to hit up the pool area, which was SWEET. Loved the bright colors and lounge chairs in the water. Waitresses were hot, and attentive. It was quiet on a Monday afternoon, but we still loved it, and regretted not having made the trek sooner. Drinks were expensive, but it's a pool, and to be expected. The banana frozen drink was delish.\n\nI would definitely consider staying next time, and thumbs up for the pool - it's not TOO far off the Strip, and hell, a cab ride was like $5. Lesson learned. The Palms is HOT.
