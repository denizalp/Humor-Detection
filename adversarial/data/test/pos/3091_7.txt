Now housed in newly renovated bungalo with indoor and outdoor seating and lots of character, Chef Claudio is back and Pa'La will not disappoint... you can tell he put his heart and soul into the project and continues to do so with his locally sourced menu that changes daily.\n\nOn a recent Thursday date night, my husband and I popped in and ordered a variety of tapas and plates to share.  We sat at the community table and ended up making a new friend (hello Tony if you happen to read this).  We enjoyed not only the food but the casual, warm atmosphere and conversation with both Chef Claudio and Jason Dickmeyer, who are both super knowledgeable on the menu, local farming, food scene in the valley, and so much more.\n\nStandout dishes from the evening were the parmesan and mozzarella + speck tapas, the Navarro bowl topped with fresh grilled grouper, ceviche, anchovies, and of course, their schiacciata (aka Italian flatbread that made in house without white flour).  All delicious!  We brought our own bottle of wine -- until they get their own liquor license, it's a small $10 corking fee.\n\nNote: everything is served on recyclable paper \/ plastic, but the Pa'La family is committed to caring for the environment and working with local recycling companies.  The oils, vinegars, produce, grains and seafood you find on the menu is all sourced from organic farmers and artisans practicing responsible agriculture and production.  \n\nI look forward to many return visits to Pa'La, and hopefully ordering from the catering menu they offer as well.
