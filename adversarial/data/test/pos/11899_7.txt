One of my fave Strip hotels because of its overall style and sexiness.\n\nChanges for me was the resort fee charged for invited players and the parking fee of $7-10. Only higher rated player card levels get free parking. 2 major BOOs.\n\nOur fave Chandelier bartenders (both there for 8 years, already. 1 guy is from Hawaii) are still there! Rooms, view and designs are fun. There is some re-do of the iridescent bar at street entrance right now.\n\nThe 2 pools are great. Lots of restaurants. Slot drink girls are more plentiful and more on it. Floor drinks are actually powerful and they can even make special martini drinks, too!
