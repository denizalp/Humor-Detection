Absinthe is a fantastic show!!\n\nA group of us went to the 9:30p Saturday night show. We took advantage of the $49\/ticket locals special. I believe it's good through the end of June 2011.\n\nWOW it such a fun, sexy, crazy show! Like others have commented, the seating is first come, first serve so don't let Ticketmaster tell you otherwise. They almost messed us up had we not decided to just go early anyway. Our group consisted of 5 people so it was worth it to arrive 40 mins early (the line was slightly long) but we were able to all sit together in the 4th row. That was close enough to enjoy the show. The \"tent\" venue is very small. The stage is teeny tiny, but that's what adds to the show's atmosphere.\n\nI am not an absinthe-alcohol fan (I don't care for the black licorice taste) so I sipped on a jack and diet coke. Definitely having a drink to loosen up helps as some of the jokes and comedy are very off-color (i.e. visuals of a unicorn with male genitalia on its head instead of a horn) with a good measure of racism. I wouldn't recommend this show for children\/teens or ultra-conservative adults. That said, it is a hilarious show and if you are aware of what the show consists of going in you will enjoy your experience.\n\nOur absolute favorite portion of the show were the rollerskaters. When you see the show, you will know what I'm talking about! :)\n\nAll the performers were outstanding and the entire cast really works their buns off during the entire show. No slackers or lagging performances here. Go see it!
