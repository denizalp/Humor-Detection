The 10 Dundas West mess hall is baffling at the best of times.  I decided to change up my game and visit California Thai, the food court counterpart to a more expansive sit-in up in Markham.  I have not tried the restaurant proper, but this food court offering is passable. If it's quantity you seek, my pad thai was enough to feed a small militia.  I barely made a dent.  But food court fare it certainly was, lacking in both flavour and interest.  I'll probably go back to try something else, but my first impression wasn't too great.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: At first you don't succeed, THAI, thai again.\n\nMenu Readability:  Better than your average food court.  The decor is what drew me in in the first place.  It's like a green Blushberry.\n\nNeed to mention:  I was excited because my pad thai came straight from the wok.  The food seems fresh, so I'll give them another shot.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself:  Pad thai is my way of calibrating Thai restaurants.  Is this the best way?
