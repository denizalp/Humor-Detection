Conveniently located east of the north end of the strip and only a brisk walk from the last stop on the tram, if your not driving. A lot of rare and original LP's and quite a few 10\" all priced 20 to 30% higher than you would want to pay for them, probably because they have to keep the a\/c going in that place like an ice box to prevent goods from melting. \nHighly organized, which I like, so you don't have to sift through every record in the joint to find what you are looking for only to put it back because it was over priced.\nThe bargain bin in nonexistent (try down the street) unless you are looking for  Herb Albert or Ray Coniff. \nRecord City knows exactly what they have and what it's worth(+20%) so don't spend your valuable vacation time panning for gold or looking to find that unpolished gem. Similar to what the other reviewers said, if you are looking for that metal LP you couldn't find, look no further.
