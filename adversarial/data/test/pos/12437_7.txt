My Favorite Burger I have EVER Eaten, ANYWHERE!!!  Block & Grinder wins 1st and 2nd place for Best Burger!  I give them the other award because the competition is so far from what they are doing here!\n\nRare Burger!  Real RARE Burger!  They are NOT Playing here, except the Guy who wanted me to sit at the Bar!  I can be more polite and I will be next time, though next time he will probably remember me!  Where is my Food!  \n\nThis Burger is SERIOUS! !! !!!  Ordered REAL Rare and DELIVERED! ! !  Barely Tan on the outside and Dark RED on the Inside!!!  Surprised the Cheese was able to melt? !  Minimally Seasoned with GREAT Flavor! \n\nSomeone said \"Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication\" So I like that they do not have a Huge Menu, though the one they have was too much for me to figure out!\n\nWild Boar Sausage!  Fancy Salami and a Banger!  Great Appetizer!  Perhaps Overpriced as it was served!  My Suggestion is to Add some bites of the Slaw's and Breads, NOT like croutons!  I'm a Hypocrite!\n\nShannon did a Great job handling a person so hungry they canNOT read a menu and hardly has a vocabulary past Barnet Rubble's ancestors (I grunt and point)  Shannon taught me the ropes here REAL Well!\n\nThe Owners Work Here!!!  \n\nCheck the Tools on Display!  Nice Display Case with Grinders!  \n\nI told the Head Chef, I mean BUTCHER Dude what Movies to see:  \"Midnight Meat Train\" and the French Movie \"Frontiers\"!  If you are a Girl I do NOT recommend either of these Movies!!!  If you are a Dude, well, then I guess you might like to see them!  You could watch the Trailers and see!\n\n5-11-2013 \nSecond Visit - I took my Parents!  They Loved it!  My Dad ordered a Rare Burger, so did I, my Mom ordered hers Medium Rare, so glad  I got to taste the Medium Rare without having to order one, because the Rare is So  Good!\n\nCheerwine BBQ Sauce is the BEST BBQ Sauce I have Eaten!!!  EXCELLENT ! !! !!!\n\nGreen Slaw was good, Needs work!!!\n\nPear Dessert was OK, needs Much work, start over or skip Dessert!
