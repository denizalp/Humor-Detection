Arrived on a Saturday and was able to check in the early afternoon. The staff at the front desk was friendly and accommodating. Parking is complimentary valet only.\n\nI reserved 1 bedroom that included a complete kitchen, living room and even a washer & dryer. The room was located on 25th floor which had superb views of the City Center and I could walk to a variety restaurants & shops at the Crystals.\n\nImprovements at the Grand Chateau is the addition of a lobby bar and a large market \/ deli which serves Starbucks beverages. In addition, the new phase 3 of the development will be open around July and the decor will be totally different from the previous two phases. \n\nEvery evening the staff hosted an event like wine tasting, margarita get together, beer tasting and Sunday Football playoffs on a large projection screen. If you're looking for fitness activities, the Marriott offered complimentary city walks every morning and yoga classes. Lastly the indoor fitness center includes a decent amount of cardio machines, free weights and life fitness equipment.\n\nI was impressed with the changes at the Marriott Chateau and I'm looking forward to returning when the new phase opens.
