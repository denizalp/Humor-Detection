This is a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service. \n\nI ordered the calamari based on the reviews.  It was good, but nothing special.  I agree with some other reviewers that it was under seasoned.\n\nThe lobster ravioli was very tasty.  The sauce was delicious.\n\nThe bananas foster did not disappoint.  It was the definite highlight of the meal.  \n\nI would not go out of my way to go to this restaurant while in Vegas, but I had a wonderful dining experience here.
