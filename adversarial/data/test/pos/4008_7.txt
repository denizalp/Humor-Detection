Great chill spot for happy hour and bar food. It's got a fun Asian twist on the menu. It's very casual and laid back. I wish I could have enjoyed my food more.\n\nStopped in for dinner, we were seated right away. We ordered the Thai cashew hummus which was amazing. It comes with grilled pita and crispy wonton chips. And topped with a little bit of pickled veggies. That was my favorite item. I decided to go with the broccolini banh mi as my entree. The waitress did warn me it was spicy. I wanted to like but the sauce was overpowering the entire sandwich and it wasn't a good sauce. So that was disappointing. But the BF got their garbage fries: brisket, pork belly, chicken, mozzarella cheddar, guacamole, pico de Gallo and cilantro lime crema. That dish we both enjoyed. The flavors were great, like carne asada fries on crack. Fries were crispy and not soggy. \n\nOverall good experience here, really enjoyed the vibe. Good service too. Hoping to come back to try another dish when we are in town again.
