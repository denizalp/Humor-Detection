We stopped by to grab a drink before our drive home. I tried a few flavors, but the best one was the Okinawa milk tea. It has brown sugar and I think black tea. It was very unique! The taro milk tea and jasmine latte were also really good. The Hokkaido milk tea wasn't my favorite. It was too sweet and tasted kind of like ensure milk...yes, I know that sounds weird, but it does. Just get the Okinawa and you won't be disappointed!
