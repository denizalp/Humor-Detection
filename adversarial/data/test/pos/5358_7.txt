A Hangar Cafe Haiku:\n\nButter Colored Grease\nMagical, Viscous Pond\nOn Plate, In Body\n\nThe Japanese really had something going with these haiku.  If it isn't worth saying in 17 syllables, is it really worth saying at all?  True, this is contrary to every facet of my conversational style, but...\n\nI look for only two things in a breakfast place.  Eggs and hash browns.  If there are eggs and hash browns at a restaurant, it is a-ok.  But if you go to Hangar and sit at the bar, you will see them slathering a paintbrush into a golden vat and then smearing what comes out onto english muffins, into recipes, on to the griddle, and so on.  And that warms my heart in a way that would make every nutritionist cringe.  The bacon is cooked to that sublime level of disintegration where it just melts in your mouth.  Pancakes--decent.  French toast?  Actually quite palatable.\n\nBut the chicken fried steak? Now we're talking!  A dish that comes with all four of the food groups (i.e. butter, fat, grease, lard) making a succulent primordial soup on your plate.  Bursting with flavorful morsels of sausage and beef.  The perfect hangover cure, and by that I mean that if you're hungover, go stuff yourself with this meal and you'll want to die, but at least not because of the alcohol you drank.  Everyone wins, kinda.\n\nNote: at 11, they no longer serve breakfast and who wants lunch after what I just explained to you?  Although I did have a croissant club sandwich and it was very respectable!  Just not, you know, chicken fried steak.\n\nThere sometimes is a wait.  Deal.  Because if you're looking for a greasy spoon, you just found it.
