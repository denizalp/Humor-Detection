This is hands down THE WORST experience I have ever had at a retail business of any sort. Ever. I am not exaggerating.\n\nI purchased a bedroom set with a King size bed and a dining room set. Dropped $4K in one visit.\n\nThe sales portion of it went okay. Dealing with furniture salesmen is like dealing with car salesmen - they're all fast talking sharks in business casual attire that you keep at arm's length until you can hammer out a deal or loose a hand.\n\nThe nightmare came after the initial delivery and install. 5 days in on the new bed, the slats broke. At 6 o'clock in the morning they shattered. Along with the mattress, I came crashing down onto the ground. Luckily, I escaped with only minor scrapes and bruises. \n\nIt took this company 2 weeks and 8 visits to my home - EIGHT! - to finally get this resolved. The entire ordeal was surreal, I don't know how else to explain it. Every visit was by a different set of two techs and none of them ever had the right parts or any sort of explanation for the sheer ineptitude of their company. \n\nBy the admission of several of their own techs, they initially assembled the bed incorrectly and used the wrong parts to boot! They brought the wrong slats and never brought or installed the middle support beams and support legs. In fact, until the 8th and final visit, it was a comedy or errors. Just imagine \"Yakety Sax\" playing in the background as and endless parade of trucks and techs come and go, always bringing the wrong parts. \n\nDuring this whole two week affair, I spent several hours on the phone with their customer service and warehouse representatives. Endlessly I was transferred from representative to representative and manager to manager, none of them having the vaguest idea as to what was going on and how they could resolve it. I wasted 5 days of paid time off from work waiting on them to come on different weekdays. On days I had to work I was reduced to begging relatives or friends to wait there in my place. When I did get a chance to speak to someone, there was never an apology, no one ever admitted it was their mistake and no one ever ensured me they would go that extra mile to make certain the next time they sent someone out it would be assembled properly and with the right parts. \n\nI can't even count the number of times I left messages for them on machines and with receptionists, where no one ever bothered to call me back. I'm convinced that if I wasn't the one taking the initiative to keep calling them, they would have blew me off altogether. Astonishingly shady.\n\nBy the 5th or 6th visit from them and the job still not getting done, I became physically ill. I couldn't keep food down and I was at my wits end as to how to go about getting this resolved. I am an extremely laid back person and I know sometimes things don't go as planned, but by this point even I had enough. I was livid. Where was the accountability? Nowhere in sight. I lost my cool on the phone a few times - but, I never cursed anyone out or threatened them. The frustration and my feelings of helplessness just finally got the best of me.\n\nAnd you know what the real cherry on top of all this slop was? After everything was finally resolved, no one - not the salesman, not their management, not their customer service or warehouse people - all these people I had been dealing with for the span of two weeks -  none of them called to check to make sure everything was finally done right. \n\nSteer clear of this place, this company.
