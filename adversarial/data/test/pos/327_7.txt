Urban Outfitters is a fun store to peruse to get ideas but with the exception of some sale items, most everything here (or at least the men's clothing and furniture) is over priced. Add in lines at the cash and trying to get a fitting room can eat up too much of your valuable Saturday, Urban Outfitters does just about everything possible to make your shopping experience unpleasant.
