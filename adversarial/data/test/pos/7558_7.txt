I knew it was going to be bad when I heard they were putting a Nordstrom Rack literally right down the street from me but I had no idea it was going to be this bad for me & my bank account...\n\nFirst off, the place is immaculate..so well organized and it's beyond easy to find what you're looking for. Not only that but even the clearance racks are still organized where as most places, most people have picked over it in such a frenzy, it's usually impossible to keep it tidy..but NR does it!\n\nSecondly, the staff is awesome. So friendly without being in your face and when my mom had a tumble, they called me to the front, walked me over to her & really took the time to make sure she was OK. I can't tell you how much it helped that they were so nice as she was really embarrassed by the ordeal. The entire staff is friendly too..not just one or two people...specifically Stephanie, the girl who checked me out. She was so nice & really took the time to help me. \n\nThe clothes are obviously great. Great selection and for great prices for the most part. \n\nDamn you, NR for exceeding my expectations..you're going to make it impossible for me to not come in more than probably necessary.
