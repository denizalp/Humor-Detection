Seems redundant to say epic service at this place, but it is also the truth. A testament to Fairmont attention to detail. \n\nNightly live music, great wine selection and a decent beer selection, although being from Vancouver I'm used to more local craft style beers and more than 6 choices on draft. \n\nThe signature drink list is excellent too. \n\nIf you get to Toronto stop by for a drink and a nibble before heading to a game (which the Leafs\/Raptors\/Jays\/TFC) will probably lose. But at least you will have started the night out on a good note!
