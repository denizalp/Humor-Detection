It's like waiting in line for the best Disneyland ride of your life. \n\nI think me and my boyfriend stood in line for 2.5 hours (!!!) early in the morning just to eat this for lunch but it was 100% worth. The people working are super charming and keep you entertained throughout the wait and even offer you free water bottles. The seating area also has misters to keep you cool because they know you'll be waiting for THAT long. The meat on the ribs is so tender that it literally falls off the bone. The brisket is so fatty and juicy. We food coma'd so hard after. \nIt's been almost a year since we had Little Miss for the first time, but we always talk about coming back to Phoenix JUST for this. We're actually planning that second trip in a few months. I wasn't even a huge bbq fan before this, but Little Miss has made me a total convert.
