I would put this as a 2.5 star joint. It's not like it was bad by any means.. but not a place where I see myself returning to anytime soon.\n\nFirst, I saw the groupon for this spot. This was the only Indian restaurant that accepts groupon for their buffets, as the others you can only use it for a la carte. But, the lunch buffet is only 9.99, and the groupon is only available for food.\n\nWalking in, the layout is pretty nice. Everything is very clean and well kept. After sitting down, I ordered a free mango lassi that is available with a yelp check in. Out of all the mango lassi's that I've had, India Masala probably makes my least favorite. I think the yogurt they were using was about to turn, because it had a sort of cheesy taste. Also, the mango flavor was too light. It tasted more like a lassi with mango, rather than a mango lassi.\n\nOnto the food. The selection here is quite small compared to most places. The only thing that I liked was the pakora, aka the vegetable fritters. They were crispy and well seasoned. The rest of the items were pretty bland, nothing really stood out. Also, the palek paneer was pretty gross. As for the naan, it was a little bit doughy on the inside.\n\nDelhi is still my go to place, followed by Mint. Since they are basically all the same price for their lunch menu, I think I'll stick to my favorites.
