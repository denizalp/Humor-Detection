It is a zoo at this airport. Very crowded in some areas with fast walking people, yet very empty in other locations. I had to weave around people to keep up with my friend (thankfully I didn't carry any luggage with wheels). Got bumped into numerous times. But overall, the airport looks well maintained. I enjoyed seeing the trees and greenery on the inside. I also enjoyed seeing the lights from outside the airport. While standing outside in the uber\/lyft area, I noticed that there are workers there with whistles to direct the traffic. I have never seen that before, so I found it interesting. Our Uber driver told us sometimes having the people with whistles does more harm than good, but sometimes it works smoothly
