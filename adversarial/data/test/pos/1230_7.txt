Another classic NY Pizzeria spreading  a little love in Las Vegas ??!! A W E S O M E \n\nAfter reading about DeMarco's on Yelp and just a few weeks after my recent trip to NYC where I did partake in a landmark  pizzeria ( Lombardi's ) , while getting my sweat on at the gym all I could think was , what time does DeMarco's close !?\n\nBig surprise - cut the work out short , get out to my car and call in my order, \" if you can get here in fifteen minutes ...\". Hell yeah I can get there in fifteen !\n\nOrder small pizza with pepperoni and  sausage ( $11 ) and an order of Grandma's meatballs $12 \n\nPick it up and 20 minutes back home ... Food smells great - even before i get home,  i smell the basil , the pepperoni , of course I open the box and take a chunk of the crust - has a nice crunch, a little \"yeasty\" but I like it.  Sauce has a nice tang, it was cheesier than I expected but , again, it works for me.  The slight flaw is how they spread the pepperoni and sausage - both toppings tasted good but how hard is it to spread it evenly.  Overall, an awesome pizza.  I give it higher marks than Grimaldi's.\n\nThe meatballs were also impressive - might be a little pricey for what you get but man, they sure brought back memories of Mama's meatballs and yet a notch above my dear mama's sauce . \n\nI'm thinking i need a few more visits before i compare DeMarco's with Lombardi's, yes, I definitely need to do much more research !\n\npic added
