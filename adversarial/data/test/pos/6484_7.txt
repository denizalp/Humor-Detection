First and foremost, let me just proclaim that the food here is top-notch delicious! We ordered the Moroccan meatballs, baked goat cheese and the famous pig dip. The meatballs were lip-smackingly good. The pig dip was like mana from heaven. So, two thumbs up (plus two toes up) for the excellent food. \nNow, the reason I'm giving St. Francis just two stars is the service...it was ABOMINABLE. Our waitress was difficult to flag down or to even find. Since we couldn't find her, we asked another waitress to call her for us. The other waitress asked us what we wanted and we told her that we wanted a beer. She even gave her recommendation and said that she would take care of our order. From that time until we were done with our meal, we didn't see a trace of the said beer. \nTo seal our verdict on the disappointing service, when we asked for a paper bag to put our take-out boxes in (we had 2 big boxes of leftover pig dip), our waitress, who finally decided to show herself to collect the payment, said that they don't keep the paper bags up on the second floor (where we were seated) and that we could get a bag from the hostess from downstairs on our way out. All that time that she was giving us this lame excuse, we were thinking, \"Why couldn't she just go down and get the paper bags for us now?\" She was very inefficient, inattentive and unhelpful. For this reason, we don't think we'll be back to St. Francis.
