My daughter and I went on Saturday morning July 16th (11am opening time) to get some hot fresh Asian food. Lots of customers were already there but not sure why unless they were all first timers. Some hot foods were cold in the middle like the egg rolls, fried dumplings, etc. Actually most of the food tasted reheated, now that I think about it. Maybe left over from the night or day before. NOTHING SEEMED TO BE CRISPY. Sure there was lots of food but it was not as good as we hoped. The meals cost us about $16.00 for both of us but we didn't get $16.00 worth of food. We tried a little of almost everything that looked good but nothing was worth seconds. We didn't try the Hibachi grill though. The best part of the meal was the plentiful and fresh fruit bar. Can't really cheat on that. The restaurant was pretty clean except my table was sticky on the edge. The bathroom was clean but I suspect it was because it was still early.  As we left we wished it would have been better as we live nearby. Oh well.
