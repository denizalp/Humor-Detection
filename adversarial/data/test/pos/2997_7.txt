If you don't love Salud, you also probably hate sunshine, puppies, a child's laugh, and America. \n\nThere's aways a unique tap selection and plenty of hard to find bottles from which to choose. Salud could get by with great beer alone, but what keeps me coming back are the even greater people responsible for the beer. Jason is a true connoisseur, but he is down-to-earth and incredibly patient with novices - no intimidation or snobbery here. Prices are reasonable, and the beer is fresh (unless it isn't supposed to be) unlike the typical megamart. \n\ntl;dr Go drink here now.
