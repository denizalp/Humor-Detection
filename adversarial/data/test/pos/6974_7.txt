I decided to take my teenage son here for the first time, we usually go to another guy locally but he is the rudest man in town [ thats a whole other story! ] I had read the reviews and felt semi comfortable going here as my son is VERY fussy but for some reason I neglected to remember a 1star review by Aashish P...BAD MISTAKE. We got her also....in a word TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! and in Aashish words, fellow reviewer 1 starer...\nWorst haircut in years! \nI walk in and this Hispanic lady gets up. She say a word. No gesture even to invite me to sit down.  She puts a gown and wrapped my neck.  Still hasn't said a word. Then in poor English asks what I want. I said 6 on side and 1\/4 inch off top. She timidly touched my head like I was her first haircut ever!!  \nShe took off 1 inch or more. She asked how it was. I said u took took much off. She just yeah ok. She obviously didn't understand me. And they charge $18. Really!!??\"\n\nmy sentiments exactly, she is also a gum chewer. !!!!! if you walk in and get her WALK OUT, no RUN out!!!. She ruined my sons hair, and another lady [ with attitude ] there had to go in and fix it...ie my sons hair was butchered.   During the haircut I was commenting to her...DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING?!!!!! but i was swiftly shusshed by the other women barbers!!!! and told \" oh yes she is good.  GIVEN DAGGERS LOOKS BY OTHERT BARBERS. UGGGHHH worse mum experience everrr!!!!\n THIS PLACE IS UNFRIENDLY , really terrible atmosphere, EXPENSIVE  AND I THINK THE 5 star reviews are either posted by family members or LUCKY to get out alive , passing thru town customers...HORRIBLE, terrible experience. AVOID AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!   Bad ownership and management, RUDE. Take your hard earned cash elsewhere and support another local business, this place is a make money get them in and out fast joint.
