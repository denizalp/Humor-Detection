Is it Thursday evening? If so, you should be here playing trivia with some of the best trivia players in the area. Get here early or you won't have a chair or table! Bring your smartest friends, but not too many, as the teams can't be more than six players. \n\nOrder some drinks (I prefer the cider here), order some munchies (the hummus dip is yummy, so are the tater tots), and get down to business playing. \n\nThe emcee will keep things lively and moving along. There'll be a couple of intervals when you will learn the standings. If you are among the best, your team name will be announced, so when choosing your name, make it a good one. RUN, do not walk, when the round has a bonus and the first correct answer wins.\n\nAt the end of the night, if you didn't win trivia, you can always try to win a game of ms pacman (old school style) against friend, and if you have drunk too much, take a Lyft or Uber ride home! \n\nRemember, Thursday night, trivia. Be there.
