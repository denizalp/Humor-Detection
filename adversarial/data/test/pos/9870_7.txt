Before I moved out, I had read about Rawhide in the tour books.  It was different from what I expected.  Not different-bad, just different.  First, it's for kids.  I didn't go with kids, but you probably should to get the most out of it.  All the shows and the little stands (like the mechanical bull and the rock climbing wall) are geared toward the under 10 set, and it would be fun to see it through their eyes.  It is also much smaller than I expected.  The piped-in music played the \"Rawhide\" theme over and over, which I kind of loved, since I had been singing it in my head the whole drive over anyway.  I guess my final answer is this:  It's a cute theme experience, and it's something you should definitely do once, but I don't plan on going again.  In fact, when my extended family comes to visit this fall, they want to see cowboys, but I plan on finding different cowboys to show them.  Tombstone, maybe?
