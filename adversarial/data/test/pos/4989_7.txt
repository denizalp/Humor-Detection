I'll be honest, this place scares me.\n\nIt scares me enough to be reluctant to return to Vegas, a city that I love.\n\nIt scares me because if I return I'll probably eat til I burst...or literally die.\n\nI haven't eaten at a buffet, much less a Vegas buffet in years and after a while, no matter how much you dress or class them up, they all seem the same; mass produced, cookie cutter-food meant to feed the gluttonies of an overweight, diabetes-ridden America.  So when friends of mine who i consider to have serious culinary tastes started to rave about this new buffet in Vegas' Cosmopoliton resort, I had to be skeptical.\n\nI mean, c'mon, can any buffet really be that good?\n\nSo on my recent trip to Vegas I went with a large group for dinner and with all the hype, I went in with a pretty open mind.  Yes the entrance and decor is flashy and fancy as fitting for the new flagship casino\/resort on the Vegas strip.  Ok cool, but what about the food?\n\nIt only took me a few minutes of browsing the buffet aisles to realize what the noise was all about.  While some dishes are still served in large 'serve yourself' dishes and pans, the majority of the buffet items are presented in a tapas, small-plates style.  Everything from the salad bar, to seafood, to asian dishes were presented in individual dishes and tins which one, looks better and two, encourages portion control so you can avoid overloading on one dish and finding yourself running out of space for others.  I was like a kid in a Toys R us store at christmas holding a blank check given by my parents.  Basically I was paralyzed with endless choice and didn't know where to start.\n\nSome highlights:\n\nThe Mac & Cheese station - Like an omelette station, you pick your noodles, cheese and fillings and the cook will make your own custom style mac & cheese with results for better or worse and I tried a swiss-gruyere combo with vegetables thrown in for color.\n\nCarvery - aside from the usual roast chicken and prime rib, they also had roast lamb and *gasp* beef bone marrow!  \n\nDessert - full gelato bar and and array of colorful and cool looking premade desserts.\n\nBest of all, this buffet ran $40 for dinner, no more expensive than any of the other top level buffets on the vegas strip.  $12 all-you-can-eat sirloin dinner at the Golden Nugget this is not, but I wouldn't even compare the two.\n\nI may or may not be back depending how much I want to punish my stomach again.
