I'd rather stay at a Travel Lodge.  Enough said?\n\nStaying here was like paying $100 at a restaurant and being served a Lean Cuisine meal still frozen in the center.  \n\nConsidering the price I paid, I'm pretty upset at my experience.  It's also on the far end of the strip.  I'd rather stay where more action is.
