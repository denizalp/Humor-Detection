This was my first experience using movers - prior to this move I'd successfully moved to nine apartments with the help of friends and pizza parties - so I have little to compare it to. \n\nWhen three friends helped me move the same amount of stuff to my last apartment, the move took 2.5 hours. With two moving professionals it took 3.5 hours plus thirty minutes' travel time to the new place. I was anticipating that it'd take less than three hours and would cost about $250 but it ended up costing $400 plus tip. I still haven't figured out the math but that seems like a lot more than I was quoted. Whatever - at least I didn't have to lift a box, right?\n\nThe movers were almost half an hour late but luckily I wasn't in a rush to get out of my current place or into my new one. The two guys, Nathan and Jordan, were very friendly and professional and had done many, many moves before this one. \n\nI'm pretty sure part of the reason the move took so long was because they wrapped so much of stuff in blankets and bubble - a lot of it unnecessarily. The instructions that I gave were basic - nothing was really fragile and certainly nothing was antique or vintage. Just throw it in the truck and let's go. At one point I saw one of the guys wrapping my shitty 1980s 19\" TV as if it was a rare Faberge Egg - this is the same TV that I couldn't shake on Craigslist for $20.\n\nThey didn't bring the standing wardrobes as advertised and also requested - because of this I had to wrap my hanging clothes in garbage bags at the last minute and most of them barely it into my new closet intact - everything kept falling off the hangers and onto the floor. Needless to say this was a huge nuisance. I was most looking forward to seeing this marvel of moving.\n\nThe movers aren't insured to bring you to your new apartment as a passenger in their truck, so if like most people in the city you don't have access to a car, be prepared to take a cab or beg a friend (my method) to drive you to your new apartment. I didn't know about this rule so luckily a friend was able to pull through at the last minute. If the moving company beats you there they won't get started till you arrive so it's worth it to leave a little earlier than they do. \n\nNothing was broken or damaged and I was overall happy with the move - just wish it had taken less time and not been so pricey. Be prepared to spend more than you had anticipated and you'll be OK. \n\nAlso, try to have water or some other beverage handy for the movers - they were sweating up a storm and it was 30C outside (and probably in my apartment as I'd already turned off the A\/C), and I had packed all my glasses and had nothing to drink. So think ahead on this one!\n\nPayment by cash or cheque (tip only by cash).
