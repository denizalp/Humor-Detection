If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  Texas de Brazil serves heaven on a plate!  If you haven't been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, it's a never ending delivery of meat on swords.   We have been to other Brazilian Steakhouses such as Samba at the Mirage.  But they do not compare to this one at Town Square.\n\nNow I try to be a healthier eater with little bits of 'treats' mixed in.  They have a great salad bar that also comes with the meats.  On the salad bar, I found everything to be delicious and delectable.  There, of course, is green salads. What is a salad bar without actually having salads.  BUT WAIT!  You could possibly eat on the salad bar alone with the smoked salmon, spicy shrimp salad, variety of cheeses, cous cous, mushrooms, grilled peppers, LOBSTER BISQUE and more.  Now I put Lobster Bisque in all caps because it made so creamy and full of flavor! I couldn't get enough!\n\nMy husband completely skipped the salad bar and had all meats.  (Midwest Boy!).  They brought Chicken sprinkled with parmesan,lamb,  filet, filet wrapped in bacon, pork ribs, beef ribs, flank steak, sirloin steak and much more than I just can't remember.  All I know is that it was so good!  The beef ribs especially were my favorite.  The meat was so tender and it melted like butter in your mouth.  \n\nIf that wasn't enough food for you, they also bring rolls and a side of mashed potatoes for the table.  They also offer some really yummy looking desserts but who has room after all of that food?!  \n\nIf this review doesn't make you hungry for it, then my review has failed. Just writing about it makes me want to go back again.  If you are in the mood for alot of great food, this should be the place on top of your list! Will I be back again?  You better believe it!
