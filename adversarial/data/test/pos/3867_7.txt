I used to come here for lunch and decided to get a Chai banana smoothie.  The guy who was originally helping me, informed me it was a seasonal smoothie however could make a banana peanut butter smoothie.  I was totally fine and happy with my order until the Manager comes to the cashier and makes a HUGE scene.  He literally yelled at the guy making the smoothie, telling him he can't make the smoothie and to drop everything.  The Manager has no professional skills at all and made it EXTREMELY uncomfortable as he yelled at his employee.\n\nI cancelled my order and left the place, never again!  I take it making a banana + peanut butter smoothie needs to be approved by corporate in order for these guys to make it.  The Manager at this location is totally rude and has no customer service skills at all.  Seriously, what smoothie place doesn't make or customize a smoothie\/drink to the customer's liking?  Good luck staying in business!  \n\nA few locations I highly recommend besides this place - Nekter Juice Bar, TeaStreet, Pomegranate Cafe, and Bahama Bucks!
