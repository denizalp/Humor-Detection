First time trying this place out. Our server checked on us frequently for water refills and the food came out as a timely manner. \n\nI ordered a basket of Cajun fries to start and then a pound of shrimp, with corn on the cob, potatoes, and sausage. \n\nI was impressed at how sweet the shrimp was! It made me realize that other boil-style restaurants don't have much flavor, other than the spices! Another bonus, the sausage wasn't too drenched or salty. Super impressed. \n\nBut the reason why I can't give a full five stars is because their Cajun fries were so sad. There was barely any seasoning on it. Just a simple dash. And that's not how to do Cajun fries justice at the very least. My boyfriend and I joked that we would come back if we could bring in our own bag of fries from Five Guys.
