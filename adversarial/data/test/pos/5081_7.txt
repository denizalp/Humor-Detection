I am always a little giddy when I come here, because it usually means I have a rental car and can go buck wild, buying stuff like pop, bags of rice, toilet paper and anything else thats too heavy or unwieldy to carry home.  Its a big step up from my dirty, overpriced King West Kitchen (Crappin) Table.  \n\nMy favourite thing?  Their cheesy bread.  Yes, its 6 bucks a loaf....but you get to cut it yourself in a machine (super fun!), and it is sooooooo good!!!  Crispy and buttery on the bottom, white and soft in the middle, and swirled with delicious cheddar!  I can literally eat this in 2 days.\n\nThey do have a nice selection of pretty much everything, but I do get annoyed with the fruit and veg that always comes from California or Chile... particularly since Ontario produce is cheap and bountiful this time of year!  In any case, its still a great store with everything you need in a clean and well priced (compared to Kitchen Table) environment.
