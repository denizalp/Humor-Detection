I came upon this Whimsical Cottage Setting so they call it, located inside the historical commercial shopping center that is right off the strip. I actually grew up in this area playing video games at Mary K's, playing pool at Cue Club, karaoke singing at the first Korean nightclubs and supermarkets here in Vegas. Oh how this commercial center brings back so much childhood memories. If you're coming down from Sahara passing LV Blvd. you'll be making a right onto Commercial Circle to get into the Commercial Center. Then on the stop sign make a left and then an immediate right. You'll pass the first few shops and it'll be on your right that has a white wooden fence in front. It's also next to a Korean Restaurant. It could be hard to miss or easily missed, so keep a lookout when finding this hidden gem.\n\nI heard about  this place from a previous Groupon deal that I purchased and I was in great need to pamper myself from a stressful job that I recently resigned from. For $29,  I received a Harmony Pedicure and Hot-Paraffin Treatment (a $85 Value).  \n\nBarbara, a kind front desk manager checked me in and I filled out a questionnaire to let the salon know more about my general interest and what I would like more info. on in future services. She then provided me with a detailed tour of the whole place and I was amazed how spacious it was, since the outside didn't seem too appealing at first. Don't be fooled by the location, it's pure paradise inside, mystical, and dreamy as if you're on a tropical retreat. I felt this serenity upon myself being here and it felt harmonious beyond belief. It's a full service Beauty Salon, Day Spa, Beauty Bridal Specialist, Wellness Center, & Specialty Gift Boutique. They even have a meditation room for you to unwind or get a special holistic reading from Paula, the owner of this wonderful petite mega day spa.\n\nI was introduced to my nail technician, Mary Banks and what a delightful, kind-hearted lady she is. From the moment I was in her care, I never felt so relaxed and free of worries in being in a pedicure seat. I had nightmare experiences before from other nail salons, bloody cuts and all.. this was a complete dream come true for me. I have never sat in huge purple cushioned \"Budda Hands\" seats before and it was different, unique.. I loved it. They have this massage mat on top of the seat for you to use for your back while you get your pedicure. It even heats up and has adjustable power strengths of how much pressure you want for your back. Mary offered me a selection of complimentary teas and other beverages of choice. Also they have some complimentary cookies at times. I settled in with green tea and also was asked if I would like a heated neck wrap while I was getting my pedicure. I was thrilled and applied to all the offers given to me on my visit. \n\nMary has this calming aura about her that it's therapeutic to the heart. Her tone of voice is like a soft motherly love that makes any chaos in your life.. still. She made sure the temperature of the water was just right for me, always attentive and making sure I was comfortable with everything. I loved the design of the whole nail studio even to the silver square tub I put my feet into. Everything was so clean and sanitized that all I had to worry about was.. absolutely nothing :) Your mind will be so occupied of how lovely this tropical, forest, wilderness design is that you'll be in complete awe of how much it feels like your sitting in the middle of a beautiful jungle. And it actually put a smile on my face just looking around and enjoying the scenery. \n\nI picked out a color from their great selection of polishes and Mary made my feet all brand new again. The paraffin really helped in making my feet super soft and smooth. I never had a treatment where there were tons of laughs, great influential conversations about career, life, and finding great deals in Vegas. I had such a great time in getting a pedicure from Mary that I also decided to get a simple manicure from her too. She gave me my own personal filer for my nails and put it back it the wrap to take home. Mary also extended my Groupon deal if I wanted to do the same treatment again for the same great price of $29. For the service and experience I received, I couldn't pass it up. She was also so kind enough to give me her honest opinion in pursuing a career in this field, since I was showing interest in doing so. I never had anybody be so encouraging in following my dreams and be so certain about how great I will be. This positive feedback actually helped me tremendously in my career decision that I made very recently. I can certainly tell she a genuine heart in wanting to help people and has a solid passion in what she loves to do. I can't thank her enough for such a memorable experience, let alone life changing one as well.\n\nIf Groupon never had that deal... I would never think a charming place like this existed. Please make a special date & experience it for yourself.
