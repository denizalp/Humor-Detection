This review is strictly for the music venue never tried any of the food although the charcuterie plate April D had was looking very eye appealing! I came here support fellow yelper in our awesome yelp community Bobby Yang and his Unrivaled Players band. Unlike the last venue they played in here at Scullery U truly get too appreciate the music. The first thing that came too mind was MTV unplugged. Not sure if anyone remembers back in those days?? Or maybe just cause am that old. Not! Totally the vibe I got from the intimacy of such small venue. There not way that place holds hundred more like half that amount. The main stage area not really stage but more like open living room area. Not truck load of amps or equipment around just old fashion acoustic set up. The decor the cloth back drop all around, the rugs around the open living room\/stage area, and felt like seeing Natalie Merchant on MTV unplugged. The sound system is on point. Never problem between both sets. Since such small venue you literally feel like part of the band the whole time right smack next to them. I would never think from the outside find such gem of venue in downtown more less basically in back of bar. Not sure the amount of bands or if they have concerts on weekly basis. If you know of band like that playing at Scullery would highly recommend it.\n\nOne thing though about Scullery being such a small venue but more for the bar area up front. While waiting for the concert open the doors. It ridiculous HOT! Too much bodies in small area sucking up all the air. Couple of us hanging outside the front door get some fresh air. The venue itself has nice a\/c so that was weird going from hot then cool. Felt so good! The bar set up really tiny but very artistic look and inside couple of booths that can get together with friends hang out drink talk stories at. The waitress felt like not around much the whole time from before the concert during the concert. \n\nNo doubt Scullery bar that would come back again for concert. Or if going on bar crawl downtown I would make it one of the stops.
