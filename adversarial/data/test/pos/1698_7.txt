had lunch here today with Rand H and Robyn N. I had the the hot dog with pulled pork on it and baked potato fries and both of these were awesome. Rand H. gave me one of his onion rings and it was probably the best onion ring I have ever tasted.After are great lunch I stopped at the coffee shop and grabbed a berry scone and some type of orange chocolate filled cookie and both of those were great as well. So with nothing I could say negative about the place I give them 5 stars and hope to return soon.
