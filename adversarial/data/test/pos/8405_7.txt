I'm sorry, but I have to take down 2 stars.\n\nSo when Makai first opened, the food was great and the employees were very friendly. The problem was that they were new and could not cook the food fast enough to keep up with the demand of customers coming in. A lot of times, they would say \"sorry, we ran out of chicken katsu (or whatever). Do you want to wait 10-15 minutes or would you like to choose something else?\" All. The. Time. Several months after things calmed down, it was consistent. The food was always tasty. I was happy that they finally figured things out and was able to keep track of when they needed to start cooking more stuff to avoid making customers wait around. The only thing I noticed was that people would be sad when the poke was sold out, but I don't eat that so it didn't matter to me. Yup, you heard right. Someone who was born and raised in Hawaii who DOESN'T like poke? WTF is going on here??\n\nAnyway, lately this place has been disappointing. No matter what I order, something ends up not tasting right. My usual is the bowl since the sides are nothing special. My order the other day was Kalua Pig, which was tasty and the Teriyaki Steak, which was horrible. Could not taste any of the teriyaki and it was not tender at all. Another time, the Chicken Katsu tasted gross and undercooked, when usually it is pretty good. I could go on and on. Service is also not as friendly as it used to be. But I get it and sometimes feel bad for them when I see customers changing their minds at the last minute when the food was already placed into the bowl, or when they want to try samples of everything.\n\nI still come here but definitely not as often as before. Hopefully they won't keep going down this route...
