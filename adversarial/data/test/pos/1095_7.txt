Had a super duper high level kind of meeting and was hungry so I decided to come down stairs to this Blimpie for a bite.  \n\nThis place was quite clean, service was pretty fast, the staffs were pretty friendly, and the soup I got tasted like progresso canned soup.  And on top of that, they nuked it in the microwave way too long, burned my hand trying to take the lid off, and burned my mouth eating it.  I ordered their largest bowl and they only gave me three things of crackers.. I need more than just three!!  That's like ordering 20 piece chicken McNuggets, and getting two little things of sauce..  WTH!  The soup was way overpriced so don't go cheap on the crackers now!  \n\nOverall a decent experience, nothing good to say about this place, and no real complains either.  I might come back... might...... if I ever had another super duper high level kind of meeting again around here.
