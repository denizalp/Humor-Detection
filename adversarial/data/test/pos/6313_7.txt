I love trying new restaurants and rarely am I disappointed. This is the first restaurant to disappoint me in a long time. I ordered the rolls as an appetizer and the beer butt chicken as an entree, because it looks good on these Yelp pictures and I love chicken. Everything was overly salty and drenched in butter\/oil. I couldn't taste anything but salt. The service was sub-par. Our server really made me feel rushed and they didn't even have a line of people waiting or anything. The only reason I am giving it a 2 star instead of a 1 star is because of the ambiance. It also gave me stomach issues the next day.
