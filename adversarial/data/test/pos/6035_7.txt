The Telus Convention Centre is a great venue in Calgary. I've namely been here for the Art Market in November and a seminar, but they also host numerous other big events, conferences and Christmas parties. In fact, if you want to hold a party of 1,000+ people it is one of the few central places in Calgary available.\n\nIt's very accessible, right on the c-train line and along Macleod Trail. One minor thing that drives me crazy is that if they don't have a big conference going on, they lock all the doors except the ones from Stephen Avenue so you have to walk half way around the building to get in.\n\nThere are a variety of rooms and open spaces so it will accommodate many different types of events. Catering is awesome - at the seminar I went to they had an asian-themed lunch, which was easy to accommodate dietary restrictions as well.\n\nIt's also right on Stephen Ave (if you didn't glean that from my comments above) so at lunch you could wander down the street and find a restaurant or coffee shop if you didn't want what is provided.\n\nReview #24 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
