I wasn't sure what to expect, but my husband and I decided to get some tickets after seeing the very good yelp reviews. \n\nThe show is held at a pretty small theater at Harrah's. We got our tickets through tix4tonight for a cheaper price, but it looks like there are some that got great deals with drink vouchers elsewhere. We opted for general admission instead of VIP, and we weren't disappointed. Because the theater is so small, the VIP seats were not much better. My advice is to get to the theater about 45 min early! Seating is first come first serve, so you'll get seated based on how early you get there. But to be honest, you'll get a good view from almost anywhere! Some seats also have tables, but are further back. \n\nThe show is held in the afternoon, which I'm not used to. But it was honestly such a fun show that I did not mind. The humor and the magic were excellent! I have been recommending this show to all my friends! \n\nMac King sells some of his products outside the theater and is available for autographs\/photos. He's a great guy too! I would highly recommend this show!!
