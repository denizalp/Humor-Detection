Phoenix Orthopedic Consultants are a joke.\n\nMy wife's first visit TWO HOUR WAIT and  seen the doctor less than two minutes.\n\nMy wife's second visit ONE HOUR FIFTEEN MINUTE WAIT and  seen the doctor for  five minutes.\n\nThey tell you to arrive for your appointment 15 minutes early.  I don't understand why because all you are going to be doing is waiting and waiting some more.\n\nThis place gets two stars only because their staff were nice and did apologize for the long wait.  Giving an apology really goes a long way with me.\n\nIf you decide to use this practice for your orthopedic needs then consider the following first ...\n\n( 1 ) Bring A Book, Smartphone, Tablet, Magazine because you will be waiting.\n( 2 ) Consider an appointment right after the office opens.\n( 3 ) Consider an appointment right after their lunch break.\n\nAlso, bring someone with you to act as your patient advocate because these doctors are in and out so quickly that they don't give you time to ask questions.\n\nMy wife's doctor would have been out in three minutes today instead of five if it weren't for me stopping her and making sure my wife had all her questions answered to her satisfaction.\n\nYou know it just really boggles my mind that patients are waiting over an hour in the waiting room.  I don't see how its possible when the doctors are in and out in 2-3 minutes.  \n\nIf I never need Orthopedic services I personally won't be coming here.\n\nThis practice bills $200 to the insurance and for what ?
