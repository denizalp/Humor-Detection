A friend of mine has been begging me to go here with him for ages.. after hearing such a mixed bag about this place have never had a desire to try. Every meal should be a good meal, right? So when some friends of ours asked us to meet them for dinner, well, we went. \n\nMade a reservation after hearing about the wait times.. when we arrived we were sat immediately. Let me say that the space is very cool.. Ikea like, in fact we have the same floor lamp in our living room, 39.99 if interested. For whatever reason I thought that Ticoz was more upscale in their service though I was disappointed when we were told we needed to hang on to our silverware, yuck!! So be prepared to ask for new silverware! \n\nThe salsa's were a nice touch though they need to get rid of that pineapple crap.. oh and the chips, well those are Tostito's or something.. not a good impression at all. I'm not sure if they know this but Food City actually makes some really good chips they could just buy rather then use those stale disks from????\n\nGot a mojito.. very good, one of the best Ive had in the valley! Ordered apps.. guacummus (sp) and calamari.. the guacamole hummus mixture was alright.. wouldn't order that again though the pita tasty.. the calamari was definitely from a frozen bag.. though for these prices they will have to cut where they can.\n\nDoh, avoid the grilled peach salad.. tasted weird.. the blue cheese salad on the other hand.. yummy! Ive never seen so much blue cheese on a salad plate before.. kudos! We did ask for fresh cracked pepper, our server put a shaker of pepper on the table.. its little touches like these that can make or break a place.. guess that kind of service is overlooked here. \n\nI have to say though that the burgers were awesome! Both juicy, well cooked and delish! Criss cut fries were well seasoned and very tasty! The coleslaw that came on the side could have been omitted completely as it added nothing to the plate but bulk. Those burgers were fagalicious! \n\nI wish I hadn't waited so long to go here as it was everything I thought it wouldnt be.
