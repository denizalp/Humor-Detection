Bobby Q BBQ. Clever. The restaurant had me at the name but it didn't hurt that they made Yelps 100 places to eat list. What does one do when they find themselves in Phoenix for the first time ever? Head over to Bobbie Q, of course. I came here for one reason and one reason only. Baby back ribs. I do love my baby backs. There is a pretty large parking lot to fit all the hungry BBQ lovers in one place. As I walked in and smelled the smoky goodness, the hostess in the front handed my party of three a bag of freshly made cinnamon sugar donuts while we waited a few short minutes for a table. Like a child who's been offered desert before dinner, I gleefully followed the hostess to our table whilst munching on my sugary donuts. Our waiter took our drink orders and I decided on the baby backs with a side of potato salad and mac and cheese. \n\nAfter what seemed like a forever of eyeing and sniffing my neighbors meals, our plates came out. The full rack of baby backs were huge. The photo does not do it justice. Talk about a bang for your buck! They smelled amazing as the smokey aroma filled my lungs. I went in with my knife and realized how easy the cut was. There is hours of love put into these ribs because the first bite just melted in my mouth. The best thing about these ribs...they are not overly sauced. You can ask for extra BBQ and add as needed, but the meat is not masked with sauce. I got through about half of the tender rack of ribs before I realized that I still had two bowls piled high with mac and cheese and potato salad. I used the complimentary corn bread with butter to create potato salad and mac and cheese sammies and inhaled my sides. The mac and cheese was so creamy with a distinct sharp cheddar flavor. I wish that the cheese was a little more gooey than creamy, but the flavors where there. The potato salad had good flavor and great textures. It paired really well with the sweet cornbread. Heads up, this place won't do you well if you are on the diet. This is one cheat meal you will not regret. \n\nThe service was pretty impressive. Our waiter gave suggestions and replaced our drinks with new ones before we finished the original. Our food was served hot and when we were tipping over from being too full, he brought out to go boxes to pile our leftovers in. One of the managers was walking around in the restaurant and checking on tables throughout our meal. We gave kudos to the chef when he asked us about our experience. I didn't imagine Phoenix to be known for BBQ, but I was not disappointed with what I got. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating (with a sprinkling cooling system) with big enough tables to feel at ease. As I walked out, another bag of cinnamon donuts were handed to me and I vouched to be back. 5\/5 overall experience!
