I parked at the valet. Never again. Not sure what town this business thinks it's in, but we don't validate & we don't pay for valet in Vegas. Of course the attendant kept yapping at me about it when I voiced my displeasure at the $12 fee. I finally had to tell him to stop talking to me & just get my car. And for a biz that charges for valet...they take for.ever. I won't be back...not to park, eat, drink, or hang out. There's too many cool places to put up with the nonsense.
