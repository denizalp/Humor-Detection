Zero stars for this place and extremely disappointed and disgusted by them. Came for happy hour. The hostess said they are doing a special fundraiser to help people who have cancer with financial burdens. We told her my uncle who was with us has cancer currently, so it was good to see them fundraising. The security then said my uncle could not go in because males must have close toed shoes. My mom, aunt, and I have flip flops on. My uncle has woven sandals where barely any of his feet are showing the his toes are completely covered. What a disappointment and extremely upsetting.
