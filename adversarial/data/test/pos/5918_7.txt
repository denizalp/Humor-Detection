If you have a whole evening to wait for the bowl of soup you can definitely visit this place....\nWe walked through the door at 5:20 and walked out at 6:55pm... All I ordered was a bowl of beef soup and something that looked like a localized version of taco called baleada (which for $3 consisted of tortilla and 2 or 3 chunks of very salty meat). Asked for cup of water and was sold a bottle instead (I hate when restaurants do it). Will never come back unless I want to be bored to death with bachata music and irritated by a disco lights in my food plate.
