So, the last time I ate here, the wings were cold and hardly grilled.  Once I thought these were the greatest wings on the planet, not so much anymore.  This time, I ordered togo with a pizza (gladiator), the pizza, fortunately, was as delicious as usual.  The wings, quite tasty, however undercooked they were.\n\nThe wings had a great char-grilled flavor.  The sauce is quite tasty with a sweet\/hot flavor, but when you bite into a wing and see raw meat, it's a real turnoff.  Not just disgusting, but dangerous.  Salmonellosis is a thing and can kill.  Please, LGO, please!
