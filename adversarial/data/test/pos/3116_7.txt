Everyone knows Majerle's is overpriced and doesn't feature the highest quality food (frozen burger patties)\nThat being said, it wasn't a bad three hours spent here watching football on a Sunday morning\/afternoon. They need alot more food specials (they had one), but the drink specials, including $3 domestic drafts, were up to snuff. Every single football game was on one of the TV sets and they featured the Cardinals volume. It just depends on what you order and your price points in your head to determine if you made a wise dining decision. The chicken tacos were very wise with three chicken stuffed tacos served with incredibly fresh chips and some salsa. The place mostly filled up by 11:30am and service was great as well. Lots of regulars saving seats at bar (AKA the older drunks), but friendly crowd and shout out to the poor older Bills fan who still is a passionate fan despite no playoffs in like 20 years.
