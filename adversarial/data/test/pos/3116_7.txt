Just moved in to Sevilla last week, despite horrible reviews, its a decent apartment complex, certainly not luxury living, but I've seen much worse. The playground could use some touching up. Broken closet doors, wobbly fans and leaky faucets, all jenky when we arrived but maintenance has already been out to fix it all. Seems energy efficient thus far. I don't know how the two story units are, but the one story casitas are nice.
