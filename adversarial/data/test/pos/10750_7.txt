*Thumbs up*\nAwesome, awesome show. Obviously, if you're a fan of Michael Jackson and you know all his hit songs and dance moves, you will enjoy every single second. The Cirque influence is subtle -- this show is more about the music and dancing, less about any circus stuff.\n\n*Thumbs down*\nNothing really negative to say. Yes, prices are sky high (more so than other Cirque shows in Vegas), and you need to book far in advance to get your desired date and seats.\n\n*Tip*\nIf you can, splurge for seats in the middle center section. That's the sweet spot.
