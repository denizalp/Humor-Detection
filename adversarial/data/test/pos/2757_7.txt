The most welcoming and inviting store. The owner is passionate about the business and sharing her expertise and joy with her customers.\n\nIt's a beautiful space, a thoughtful renovation with colorful yarn on all the walls. \n\nIn the back there's rocking chairs and space to sit and knit and talk. \n\nThere are some hand knitted items for sale and a rack full of supplies and accessories. \n\nDefinitely an unique store and a welcome addition to Millvale.
