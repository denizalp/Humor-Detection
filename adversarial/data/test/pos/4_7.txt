This place is clean, the staff is very friendly but the food is egh. The prices are a bit pricey. The drinks are good. I went to the girls bathroom and was horrified when I walked in and saw men dressed like women in there using the bathroom and washing their hands. I understand the new fab these days with accepting people for who they are and I have nothing against cross dressers but it doesn't make me feel comfortable for me walking into the girls bathroom and me trying to use the bathroom when technically there is men in there with me. I wouldn't come here again and I don't know how should've addressed the situation about the bathroom without upsetting anyone.
