I think they're a complete rip-off. They quoted me ~$3000 in fees for maintaining on the following parts: power steering line, front exhaust and muffler joint leaks, battery, rear brake, front pads and rotors, and replacing a couple of light bulbs. \n\nThere are a few problems with this.The first is that I just got my battery replaced a month ago, and it's brand new, so there's no way in hell there could be anything wrong with that. Secondly, they quoted me around $250 to replace the lightbulbs, because they said that the wiring was messed up, and the lightbulbs wouldn't work unless they replaced the wiring. Now, I went to my own mechanic, and he told me there's absolutely nothing wrong with the wiring. In fact, he replaced both bulbs for $20 and they work perfectly. \n\nMy own mechanic did everything Toyota would have charged me $3000 for, and he did it for $350. My mechanic did it for 1\/10th of the price, and the car works great! So I suspect that Toyota is making up fees just to rip people off, because they told me my wiring was bad, and there was in fact nothing wrong with the wiring, and I know this because the lightbulbs work just fine. Don't bother going to them, in my opinion they're a rip-off.
