I've been coming to Phoenix once a year for the last few years, and I think I've found my go-to bar for future trips in The Little Woody. My husband and I came for after-dinner drinks with two friends living in Phoenix, at the recommendation of another local. It was pretty ideal in every way.\n\nThe vibe was relaxed and kind of hipster, which is a quality I've come to appreciate in Phoenix. I loved the decor--there was an owl motif and the walls were covered in little cross-sections of wood, like a wallpaper made of coasters. There were games like darts and skeeball, which we didn't play, but enjoyed in theory. Instead we plonked down at a comfortable table--readily available at 9:30 on a Saturday--and enjoyed a couple rounds of drinks.\n\nI had two cocktails, and both were excellent. The Beeting was delicious, refreshing and smooth with a flavorful dose of beet--made with Hendrick's gin, St. Germain, fresh lemon, beet pur√©e, and ginger syrup muddled with cucumber and basil. The Rhubarb Rye Old Fashioned was a great take on a classic, a mix of Templeton rye and rhubarb bitters with muddled orange, Amarena cherry, and a sugar cube. Top shelf  liquor with balanced, thoughtful preparations.\n\nService was also fantastic. Our server Amanda was super friendly and attentive, even when the bar filled up toward the end of our visit. She even defaulted to splitting our checks, something that never happens in L.A. I expect to come back to Phoenix at some point next year, and I'll plan to stop by The Little Woody again while I'm there.
