My friends were staying there earlier this year 2014 and got sick and matched all of the symptoms of the NOROVIRUS.Even if you match all of the awful NOROVIRUS symptoms but don't see a doctor and get lab tests, the hotel will wiggle out of the NOROVIRUS cause and deny it was the NOROVIRUS. If you get the NOROVIRUS you will suffer.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Health Dept website indicated there are reports of the NOROVIRUS in Las Vegas.  It is still a continuing problem.
