Okay... I confess. I am a believer in the vanity benefits of a \"fake & bake\" tan.\n\nI looked in the mirror the other day and a colourless complexion stared back at me (very unappealing) After this life altering experience I decided it was time to get a little colour and headed over to Bellair Tan on my lunch-break.\n\nWith not much to go on or to compare to - i believe after my time was up I had some colour and apparently I did.\n\nWhen I got back to the office, my coworker asked me why I was \"red in the face\"?\n\nI have no complaints about Bellair Tan - it's clean and the staff is friendly...just wished I had gotten the summer glow I was looking for in the one session. I guess I am just hard to please.
