Always a great experience at Carrabbas. We love to come during happy hour and sit in the bar for cheap drinks and half off appetizers. Happy hour is during the week from 4-6:30pm. Drinks are half out in entire restaurant but the half price apps are in the bar area only. Food and service is always consistently good. Our server during this visit on a Friday night was Mike and he was fantastic!! So down to earth, friendly, and provided excellent service. \n\nWe started with appetizers of Wings and Burrata. The wings are baked and then tossed in butter and spices and served on a cast iron skillet so they are crisp and delicious. The burrata caprese is our favorite!! It's the best I have had and it's so refreshing when added to their fresh hot complimentary bread.  \n\nNormally I get the chicken Bryan which is to die for!!! But tonight we tried the lamb chops that were on the seasonal menu. We had never had lamb before and wanted to try it. It was served with grilled veggies and a salad that were both good. The cook was perfect and had good flavor. Honestly I don't think I'm a big lamb person but if you are, I'm sure you would love these! It was great to try.\n\nThere is so many great items on the menu and the portions are good size. The meat is always so juicy and cooked to perfection. You can tell the fresh ingredients they use on everything. It's a little more pricey then most places but for the quality I think it's fair. That's why we try to go during happy hour because you can't beat half price appetizers.\n\nGreat service and excellent food always! Highly recommend! They always do a wine and food pairing menu once a month which is fun to attend. I have been once and it was a great time. Hoping to come back and try it again. It's about $40-$50 a persdepending on menu but you get a 5 course meal and 5 wine pairings. Sign up for their emails to learn more.
