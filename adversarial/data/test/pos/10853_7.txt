Don't come here for Summerlicious. This is a live review. First of all, I never write a review for restaurants because I'm usually forgiving of the service. But this is the first time I've ever received such poor attention and hospitality at a restaurant. \n\nI'm sitting at the restaurant as we speak. I made a reservation at 1pm for a table of 3, had to wait 20 minutes to put in our order, 30 minutes until we had to ask for water ourselves, an hour and a half now and our appetizers haven't arrived. \n\nWe have watched a table eat their entire meal and paid for their meal and left. We watched a couple sit down at the hour and a half mark and still get their food before ours. \n\nI have made lovely conversation with the two tables beside me complaining about their slow service. \n\nI have just left. I repeat, don't come here for summerlicious.
