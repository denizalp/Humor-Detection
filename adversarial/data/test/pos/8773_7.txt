This place was extremely overrated.  Any place that makes you wait three hours to get a ticket to be seated for something as simple as a pizza is not worth the time.  There are these new things, they're called reservations.  Hello?  \n\n I wanted to try this place when it won best pizza in the US.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  All I can say is someone either paid a lot of money to make this place the best pizza place, the contest was rigged, or all of the judges were high and had the munchies.  \n\nConsidering that most pizzas take about 15 minutes to make, in the time it takes to get seated I could have had a dozen pizzas from other places that are a million times better and way less pretentious.  I won't be back.
