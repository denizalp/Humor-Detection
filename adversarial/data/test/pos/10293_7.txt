Quality of fish: great! Especially the salmon, very fresh and fatty\n\nFish to rice ratio (nigiri): 1:1.5  - a little too much rice IMO, but it just depends how you prefer your nigiri.\n\nService was a bit slow, but the restaurant was pretty busy during lunch hour.  I would give this place another shot, probably during slow hours.
