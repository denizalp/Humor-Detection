When we came to check in to the flamingo, there was such a long line and it moved very slowly. All of the check in and check out kiosks where unavailable or out of order.  When we finally arrived at the front desk, the gentleman waiting on us was amazing.   He offered us a couple of food vouchers and buffet vouchers which we asked to upgrade to a better room with a refrigerator instead and management accepted that offer.\n We were on the renovated side and the room was  Spacious for being a standard room and it was very clean feeling. \n We declined  Housekeeping for  Credit to our room and to \"go green\".  Although there are a few hiccups along the way, it didn't have anything to do with the rooms and I really enjoyed staying at this hotel...  Well the one thing that happened with the room was that we had a smoking room and there were no ashtrays and when we asked them to bring them up they never came, twice.\n I would definitely stay here again although the resort fee is really high, the cheap rooms balance that out.  Resort fees are ridiculous.  Everywhere
