Situated near the busy shopping complexes in the neighborhood of Elizabeth l, I could bet this restaurant would be packed with people on weekdays for lunch! Entering inside found the line up to the counter was towards the right, but having missed it we thought a waiter would seat us inside. But it was a self order restaurant. The menu was small and easy which saves you the trouble of going to through pages of exotic food with hopes of getting back something close! My friends and I ordered a couple of TNT beef burgers and chicken sandwiches with sides. We took an empty table and our food came within a really short wait. The burgers were extremely tasty and juicy. The sides were not perfect- the French fries looked shabby and the onions rings thick with excess flour. Towards the end of our meal, we started taking smaller bites since everyone of us wanted to extend the relishing taste of the juicy burgers on our palate and rather take smaller bites than finishing early with empty plates.\n\nLooking at the reviews we initially thought the place would be a fine dine restaurant but it was a modest place serving great delicious burgers! Definitely recommended for any foodie! Or Burgerie!
