So why have I downgraded my previous review? \n\nFirst, the positives:\n\n- The technician, Laurie\/Lori (I think), did everything to make me comfortable during my three, count 'em, THREE separate MRIs.\n- I was grateful to the facility for allowing me to schedule all three at once.\n- They have really late hours.\n\nThe main reason for the downgrade is that the guy at the reception desk was sick. Really sick. Like hacking up a lung, maybe two. I heard it throughout the 2+ hours of my visit, even with the door closed in the procedure room, the jackhammer noise from the machine, and the music playing from a radio to block the noise. Sneezing, blowing his nose, but also handing me papers to fill out beforehand. I'm a germophobe in general, but this was beyond the pale.\n\nThis is a serious lapse on the part of management, who allowed this man to stay at work. My husband, poor soul, sat in the waiting room the whole time, and had to go over and close the reception window to try and protect himself from all the germs being spewed out into the small room. I returned to Vegas two weeks ago, having caught a fever from my daughter, and ended up in a hospital with pneumonia. I shudder to think that my husband will get sick and I'll get even sicker. \n\nThe other reason is one that others may respectfully disagree with, but it is a turn-off to me. I do not patronize establishments that wear religion on their sleeves, and I won't name any specific ones here. (Just think chicken, arts and crafts, and certain sandwiches). I hadn't noticed it last time, but this time the waiting room contained a copy of the Holy Bible. I think that's inappropriate at a medical facility.\n\nAlso, the TV in the waiting room was airing a Hallmark movie. A patient is not going to watch an in-progress movie, and if they catch it at the beginning, they're not going to want to leave after it has started. I shudder to think that even Fox News could have been a better choice for a waiting rooom. Obviously, this was for the benefit of entertaining the receptionist, to give him something to do in-between runs for new boxes of tissues, since he directly faced the TV. I do believe that at some point my long-suffering husband asked him to change the channel.\n\nI'm still grateful for the ability to have an open MRI, which is the only way to go if you're claustrophobic. But I've also learned that there are open UPRIGHT MRIs in this city, which I had searched for last time and couldn't find. You're sitting straight up at that type, so it's even more open. Neither one offers the clarity of a traditional MRI, and I don't know if one has an edge over the other (and I will find out). But it's good to know that this place is not the only game in town.\n\nOh, and the tech personally handed me the disc, so Mr. Snotnose didn't have to touch it.\n\nUpdate: I called to speak with the manager. The same guy answered the phone, after asking for my name, which I gave him. I'm sure he knew why I was calling. After putting me on hold, he returned to say that \"he was informed that the manager had just left for the day.\" This is a small office. It is inconceivable that a manager could walk out of the only exit without saying \"good bye,\" or \"see you Monday.\" No, this POS wouldn't put the call through. One more star deducted.
