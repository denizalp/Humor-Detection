First I have to say I hate sushi.  I am not one of those people that say that and have never tried it - I have tried tons of it at many different places around the US and decided last year, damn I would just rather have a burger somewhere.  HOWEVER, last night in a quick drunken negotiation with my friend ('Please can we go to Enso??  I'll buy you dinner!!!')  So we ate at the raw bar and she got the Yum Yum roll and I got the lobster tempura roll.  Anything fried has to have some value - yes?  So I do admit when I am wrong - both rolls were fantastic and filling.  Hers - I have no clue what was really in it but there was a sweet taste like roasted red pepper?  I have never had a roll like that before.  Mine was fantastic and not complicated and the ginger was fresh and beautiful.  I think my roll was around $12 or $13 dollars so it was a bit pricey.  Great service and hilarious chefs behind the counter who were sparring with each other in a brotherly way.  And yes I WOULD return even if I had to pay for my own dinner next time!!
