i visited the wynn two weeks in a row on two very different occasions.  one with my partner and one with my son.  \n\nthe first trip truly deserves 5 stars.  the room (we had a panoramic view room) was breathtakingly beautiful, clean and beyond comfortable.  every single person we met worked hard to take care of us, ensuring that we had everything we needed.  it was an amazing experience, a 5 star experience and this experience was the catalyst to bring my son back the following week.  \n\nthe second trip really was a one star.  we still had the panoramic view room that was breathtakingly beautiful, clean and beyond comfortable. however, wynn is not kid friendly.  there are NO accommodations for kids.  meaning there are no kids menus, kids cannot go into about 1\/3 of the facility and there are employees there that are downright rude to children.  \n\non my first trip i asked katelyn at the spa if it would be ok if my son waited outside the gym while i worked out.  my son is 12 and very independent (we live in a city so he is very mature and wise for his age).  she said it was fine.  so you can imagine my absolute shock when we came the following week and she told me he is not allowed to sit there and not only that, called a very incompetent spa manager, trish, who proceeded to berate me and absolutely ruined our day and put a terrible cloud on the entire trip.  she was condescending, rude and implored me to hire a nanny to watch my son (for hundreds of dollars) while i spent 35 minutes at the gym.  to add salt to the wound, the spa's general manager, niki, told me she would look into a solution for me and promised to call me within 15 minutes.  3 hours later i never heard from her and so i called her.  she then told me she was sorry she didn't call, there was nothing she could do and then referred me to another manager tanner.  so i spent another 20 minutes explaining the entire thing to tanner only to find out that he is the front desk manager and could not help.  words cannot express my frustration and disappointment.  however, he did refer me to matthew who is the manager and he was incredible, logical and very helpful.  \n\ni am not sure how they can have people working in the spa area that are so incompetent and downright rude.  my son was so upset by this that he was afraid to walk near where they were to go to the pool so he created a short cut through the spa store so as to not see them.  this is horrifying.  no human being should feel so terrible at the wynn and yet my son did.  \n\nthe experience really put a damper on our trip making us wonder if the first visit was just a one off and that the second visit is really what a wynn experience is like.  \n\ni will say that there were some bright spots in the trip and those were thanks to mariana at the front desk (she was extraordinary),  matthew the hotel manager and vince (our waiter at lake side).  \n\nwith all of this said, wynn is a luxurious hotel with an amazing pool, stunning rooms and great restaurants and shopping.  i do not think it is kid friendly and i am very upset about how we were treated on our second trip and would consider going to the four seasons next time we visit.
