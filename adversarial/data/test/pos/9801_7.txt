I like that they lead with warm slices of ciabatta and a dish of bruschetta.  The bread is brushed with a touch of garlic.\n\nWe ordered and shared several dishes:  chicken parmesan which came with spaghetti noodles and a nice marinara.  Cheese ravioli, a nice mild filling of ricotta and spices.  Angel Hair which was ordered with a vodka cream sauce that was also very nice.  And chicken and sausage cacatorri, my favorite.  Lots of chicken medallions, sweet and spicy Italian sausage, red and green peppers, onions and stewed tomato's with a flavorful and robust blend of spices.\n\nThe portions were generous, particularly for the kids meals.  Prices were a little higher than average but the food was well above average.\n\nThe service was great.  Papa Razzini's is not very big so the setting is a little more intimate than many valley restaurants.  I like a cozy Italian restaurant so that works for me.  The have some nice outdoor seating as well.\n\nI know, boring review.  Sometimes I just tell it like it is.
