I've given two stars because in the beginning, they were great.  A far cry from their service now. I used snappy lawn service for more than three years, and have finally thrown in the towel (shame on me for not doing so sooner).  Having two rental properties in the Tempe\/Phoenix area, and living out of state, Snappy has been a struggle to deal with and their customer service (or lack thereof) has been frustrating at best.  The woman who answers the phone (I believe her name is Lisa?) is never friendly and has a demeanor on the phone which epitomizes the company name - snappy. (Oh, you're right, I guess the fact that I'm getting HOA letters about weeds is really my fault!)\n\nI could write pages, but I'll summarize with the example of just one home which has a small lawn, lots lot of foliage and flowers, plus three palm trees.  Not a large yard, but beautifully landscaped and requiring attention. Skip to now: the lawn is atrocious, two of the palm trees are dead and may not be salvageable, and we've lost countless plants.  Twice I've been down to inspect, have been shocked at the condition, and have had to call Snappy to understand how this could have happened without being brought to my attention.  Long story short, the lawn will never be the same.  \n\nAdditionally there were several discrepancies with the billing that came up from time to time. Do yourself a favor and find someone else to take care of your lawn needs.
