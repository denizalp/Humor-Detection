The designers of this shopping haven are evil geniuses.  Just when you think you are done shopping and thinking that you are heading back to the casino, you find yourself walking down a new wing full of stores.  It is a labyrinth!\n\nThere is a fountain that you have to purposefully walk around in order to make it back to the casino.  If you take too wide of a swing, you will wander down into a dead-end path of more and more shopping!  We fell victim to this design trick several times.  So trixy!\n\nThe Anthropologie store that is here is just like others that I've been to.  The reason I have to write though is that I ended up getting TWO pairs of Joe's Jeans for a total of $70.  I left feeling like a champion!  That is, until I got lost trying to find my way back to the casino again...
