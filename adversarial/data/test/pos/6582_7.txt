IT'S JUST A-OK.\n\nSo when you choose to eat here your options are pretty simple. You can choose whatever house specialty pizza at different prices they have or you can choose your own unlimited toppings for 8.95. Mind you that they only have one size and I would say that it's a little bit smaller than a medium pizza hut pizza.\n\nSo here's your steps for your custom built pizza.\n\n1. Choose your Dough. (Wheat, Gluten Free, or Traditional)\n2. Choose your Sauce. (Crushed Tomato, Spicy Diavola, Creamy Alfredo, or Pistachio Pesto)\n3. Choose your Cheese. (Mozzarella, Jack, Gorgonzola, or Asiago)\n4. Choose your Meats. (too many to mention)\n5. Choose your Veggies. (too many to mention)\n\nWhen you hear of this place and find out you can put whatever toppings you want for 8.95 of course it sounds like a good bargain. So naturally I was thinking for the toppings why not EVERYTHING?\n\nHere's where the problem lies. When I was there that day, I told the guy I wanted all the toppings on there. He said, you can do that BUT not all of it will get cooked properly and not only will it not look right, but most of the toppings will fall off when you take your first bite. \n\nNow I dont know if he said that so that he wouldnt lose money since you would have all the toppings he offers on there, so I ended up only going with about 8 toppings total on mine. I ordered another with just extra cheese and extra pepperoni because that's all my 8 year old likes to eat.\n\nSo overall, I was kind of disappointed. Dont get me wrong, everything tasted good but the fact that I can eat one pizza by myself, that can get expensive, especially with a family of 4. \n\nFor a complete list of their menu items, address, and contact info, visit their website at www.custombuiltpizza.com
