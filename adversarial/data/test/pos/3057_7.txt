This would probably be considered a locals place. I went with some girlfriends to the Wilson Phillips concert that was held in one of their ballrooms\/showrooms. We met up a few hours prior to the concert, and had drinks at their bar located in the middle of the slot machines. Our server was friendly and quick, always checking to see if there was anything we needed. \n\nThe actual ballroom where the concert was held was pretty cool. As it is a multipurpose room and not an actual concert hall, they did their best to transform the space. It worked and we had so much fun reliving our teenage years. (how I still know all the words to Wilson Phillips songs, will forever remain a mystery). \n\nAfter the concert, we checked out their live entertainment portion of the casino floor. The band was great! I would classify them as an 80's cover band by the way they were dressed, but all the songs they did spanned generations and people young and old were out there on the dancefloor. \n\nWe wandered around the casino floor in search of Carnie Wilson, and lo and behold, she was found! We snapped a photo with her, and she was very friendly. \n\nThanks, Eastside Cannery, for providing affordable concerts, decent drink prices, and at a place close to home!
