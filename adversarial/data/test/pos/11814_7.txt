Was sooo disappointed with this place. I went here with some girlfriends of mine and we went upstairs to see the guys dance. When I asked if i could buy a dance I was told no but I could sit beside my girlfriend while she got one. Really!? Why? I understand the buzzkill for the woman to see a hot guy dancing in another man but honestly that was such a buzz kill for me and was really hoping to enjoy myself there.
