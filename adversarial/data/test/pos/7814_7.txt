I am about 3 weeks post-op from a breast augmentation with Dr. Olsen. I have been looking into getting one for years and have visited a few different doctors. After my consultation with him I finally decided to go ahead and do it. He was very informative, he wasn't worried about \"pitching\" me, what I should and shouldn't do, he started off informing me about the procedure and answered all my questions. He made me feel very comfortable and not rushed, I felt like he cared to help me with what I was looking for, not another patient in and out the door. He also took the time to describe what he does, how he does it and why he does it the way he does without pressuring you to do what he thinks or wants you to do, its your decision and he voices his opinions, concerns and facts. Having an actual discussion and not a sales pitch, I knew he was the one for me. The office staff is also very nice and helpful, I think I spoke with Jane and Brittany multiple times, with different questions. Every time I have called or visited they have taken good care of me. Everyone's body is different in the way surgery goes, healing process, it can all vary, but so far I am satisfied with everything. The surgery center was nice, the nurses, the anesthesiologist, everything from start to finish was nice and smooth. The healing process is always a bit rough, but I am doing good! Thank you to everyone at APSI and thank you Dr. Olsen!\n\nOhhh and on a BIG side note, I appreciated the night after my surgery Dr. Olsen called me himself to check to see how I was doing. At that time I was good, but the next morning I was in a lot of pain. I unfortunately text him at like 6am with my concerns thinking it would take hours to hear back, if even at all on a Saturday morning and he got back to me within 2 minutes! Who does that!??? A doctor who cares, that's who! I really appreciated that on a Saturday morning, he was so nice to help me and with his suggestions made my problem 10 times better. Thanks so much for that!
