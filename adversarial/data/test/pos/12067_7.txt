I've seen Boyz II Men a couple more times since I wrote my original review.  I saw them for the second time last summer and sat farther back in the theater.  I came back again recently because I wanted to sit closer to get good video of my favorite performances from the show.  I was able to get front row center, and I loved being able to take good videos and not have anyone block my view.  The show is still absolutely fantastic.  However, it was a totally different experience than when I sat front row five years ago.  My whole section was female, and most of them rushed the stage during the handing out of roses and during the closing number of Motownphilly.  Sheesh!  In fact, many ladies from all other sections of the theater rushed the stage to get roses, and personally I thought it was sad to see the begging and the people who left empty-handed.  It was not that crazy when I first went five years ago!  Then everyone rushed the stage during Motownphilly.  I wasn't crazy that I paid for my front row seat only for people to be allowed to crowd the space in front of me.  This was not allowed before.  To make matters worse, some of the ladies had B.O.!  There was another part of the show when the guys came out into the aisles to dance with people.  Again, lots of crowds around the guys and people just wanting to get their selfies with them, but that's the culture these days I guess :\/\n\nI still think the guys put on a great show.  In particular, I love their Motown and a cappella sets, and I thought their cover of Bruno Mars was so much fun!  The other aspects I mentioned above however take away from the show for me personally.
