It was Sunday morning and my sis texts me.  \"Wanna go for dim sum?\"\n\nMan, did that sound good!  We met there around 1pm.  This place was packed!  We waited thirty minutes for a table of seven.  It's looks so different in there.  The chairs were covered with what must have been a clearance on orange chair covers.  The light orange cream curtains hung like a big puffy swag that was forced to fit the windows.  If the color scheme was mauve, it would have looked like a funeral parlor.  That was the down side to this place.  But who really cares.\nThe cart rolls by, she looks over at us and started to walk away.  \"Excuse me!\"  I hollered after the cart lady and pointed  to our table.  My sister laughs.\n\"We don't have any silver ware and plates yet, you dork\".  She says.  The cart lady nods to say that she thought the same thing.  I don't care!   She can leave the little steamers on the lazy susan.  I was hungry.\nFirst off, we got two servings of the little shrimp dumplings.  This is one of my son's favorites.  From the same cart came the roast pork bao, tofu wrapped ground pork, steamed pork dumplings, and chicken feet.  My nephew wanted to try the feet, but backed out when it was placed on his plate.  It was perfectly steamed with just enough salty brown sauce.  Nobody wanted it try it.\nNext cart came the steamed gingery tripe.  It was a little chewy and underdone, but not too bad.  Out came the meatballs, blanced kai lan or Chinese brocolli, fried seafood pastry (was  actually pretty good) and sticky rice.  \nWe also special ordered some rock crab balls, salt and pepper calamari and roast duck.  This is the second time I've had room temperature duck.  I am not a fan.  I like it steaming hot!  It must be the fat and how it likes to stick up the roof of my mouth!  Yuck!  I'll make sure I ask them to reheat it (hopefully they don't use the microwave).  \nI'm not too crazy about their dessert selection so we passed on that.\nBoba Thai iced tea hit the spot instead of the usual hot green tea.\n\nFor as much food we got, the bill only came to about $89 before tax and tip.  This is by far one of the best dim sum for extensive selection and yumminess  in the East Valley.
