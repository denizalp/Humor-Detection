I forgot how much I liked Moka when I moved from Madison a few months ago. But after coming back for a visit this past weekend (not just to check out Moka... just wanted to be clear =P) I have been flooded by wonderful memories of delicious, hot drinks ordered and picked up from the comfy confines of my car during the cold, winter months and decadent, creamy blended drinks during the humid summers.\n\nThe drinks are great. Whether you are trying a seasonal specialty such as a sugar and spice latte or a regular cappuccino the shots are pulled just right, the milk is not burned, there is just the right amount of syrup, and  the blended drinks are mixed up to perfection (no huge chunks of ice like I often get from *ahem* chain coffee shops). They also have baked goods from local bakeries, but they sell out quick of the good stuff.\n\nAnd then there's the awesome customer service. To be honest, I used to be intimidated by the small talk at the drive-thru window, but I've come to appreciate it, especially the days when the only human interaction I have is with my 5- and 3-year-olds.\n\nPlease come to small-town Kansas, Moka. We need you!
