Winners is a store that offers name brands and designer clothes and shoes at  a 20% - 60% discount. They also offer housewares, toys and toiletries. \n\nThis location doesn't carry much for kids items, likely because the location isn't really in a handy location for moms and tots. That crowd is more likely to hit the suburb located Winners. (Of which there are plenty!)\n\nNot everything is an amazing deal, but there are incredible finds to be found. \n\nLike this time I found a pair of Calvin Klein jeans for $39.99. The same pair of jean would have cost more like $100 in a mainstream store. \n\n...and believe me when I say it is so worth it to buy designer jeans - it's like you get a butt makeover when you wear good quality, well-designed jeans...
