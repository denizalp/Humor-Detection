*Part of my \"I didn't stay here, I just walked around or gambled tour*\nWasn't overly impressed with this hotel. Yes the outside looks marvelous and the inside was gorgeous but the simple fact that I lost a lot of money at the tables and couldn't get a drink in the 1 hr I was there makes me never want to step foot in it again. The staff wasn't friendly as well. Especially the \"No personality pit boss.\" I guess I am biter. Yes that's right, I am!
