It's my party & I'll Thai if I want to!\n\nThis Thai-ny restaurant may be petite but they pack huge flavor into their dishes. They have multiple locations, however, the chef at this location is our favorite! The portions are generous and the flavor is always on point. The ambiance is dive-y and at times the service may seem scattered, but this place stays busy since the food is En-Thai-cing! For lazy weekend nights, we always order take-out from this place without a second thought. The Appe-Thai-zing food keeps us coming back!\n\nItems we tried:\n\n* Beef pad see ew $6.95 - Really juicy! We order this dish every single time we dine here and it's always delicious! They're very generous with the wide noodles. The sauce is an explosion of flavor, mixed with lots of Chinese broccoli, fluffy egg soaked in all of that tasty sauce and nice amount of tender beef. Everything is cooked expertly! Rated: 5\/5\n\n* Green curry chicken fried rice $7.95 - This is another dish we can't get enough of! A flavor bomb of deliciousness! The spices and green curry flavor comes through strong, very aromatic. There are long beans added for texture, bamboo shoots, basil, carrots and green bell pepper. We're always satisfied with the flavor of this dish! Rated: 5\/5\n\n* Panang avocado $8.95 - This is my first time trying avocado in of a warm curry and let me tell you, it works, very well! The perfectly ripe avocado is added like a garnish at the very end when serving, so it doesn't really get cooked. It adds such a wonderful silky and buttery texture to the curry! I'm a huge fan! Rated: 5\/5\n \n* Combo Appetizer sampler $8.95 - It comes with 1 eggroll, 2 crab Rangoon, 2 fried shrimp, 2 fried wonton, 2 chicken satay, 2 fried tofu. It's a good-sized starter for 2 people, maybe 3. I enjoy the Rangoon and also the fried tofu is fried to crispy perfection. I love their house made sauces that's served with the appetizer, there's a peanut and a sweet and sour sauce one; I want to dip everything in them! Rated: 3\/5\n\n* Papaya salad $6.50 - It's a traditional spicy and sour salad made from shredded unripe papaya mixed with long beans, tomato, toasted and crushed peanuts and served with a side of cabbage. You can pick your spice level when you order. The flavor was balanced and the spice level was perfect. I really loved their version, but I felt the portion was small. Rated: 4\/5\n\n* Pad ped snapper $8.95 (Thai curry stir fried with crispy red snapper mixed with bamboo, bell, young pepper seed, basil and baby corn) - The red snapper filets weren't too crispy and might be from the frozen section of the market, but the sauce is where it's at! The caramel sauce was packed with deep flavor, it was hard not to like this dish. I just wish they were more generous with the sauce, pouring it over rice was awesome! Rated: 3\/5\n\n* Pad Thai $6.95 - Their version here will do just fine, but it's not my favorite. I feel that the sauce is lacking much needed, bold tamarind flavor. Usually it tastes like it's missing something. Rated: 3\/5\n\n* S11 guay-teaiw-loard $8.25 (Chicken, shrimp, squid, tofu, mushroom, with black soy sauce served over steamed flat noodle and bean sprouts)  - The wide noodles are always a favorite, but the salty and sweet soy gravy was very potent and almost killed the palate. There was a prominent ginger aroma and flavor throughout the dish. However, the overwhelming amount of bean sprouts and the protein was unidentifiable, making this dish unexciting. Rated: 2\/5\n\n*PRO TIP* add fried or soft tofu to any of these dishes to add some more protein and another dimension of texture! So good!
