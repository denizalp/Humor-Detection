I used to say AZ 88s martinis were served in a time warp. You would finish one, feel fan-freakin'-tastic and order another. By the time it arrived at your table, the effects of the first one had hit and you were wasted.\n\nAt Monkey Pants, I have to say \"Let's do the time warp again.\" I ordered a small vodka tonic with the intent of having just one drink, doing a little writing, a taking in the Monkey Pants lifestyle. I felt fan-freakin'-tastic after one. Enough to say, \"sure give me another.\" By the time it arrived.... Well, you know the story. Thankfully, I'd also ordered the grilled ham and cheese. Yummers, and very good with the VT.
