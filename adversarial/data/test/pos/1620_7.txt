¡Saludos a volver por la buena comida! With so many wonderful internationally recognized chef owned restaurants located on the Strip, we returned to Jose Andrés' Jaleo for a Spanish lunch. We had just arrived into Las Vegas only a few hours prior to our noontime reservation and we were excited for a taste of paella and other tapas.  \n\nOur server, Jason, greeted us with friendly familiarity and described the lunch menu as an abbreviated or highlighted dinner menu that we were familiar with from previous dines. We started with cocktails and ordered their 3-course lunch special. Jason piqued my interest with a cocktail called \"Con Membrillo\" that was a Seasonal concoction of quince paste, rum, egg white and nutmeg. There were probably more ingredients in that cocktail that I don't just remember listing.  But, after a couple of smooth sips, I was transported to Madrid's Plaza Mayor in Fall. My husband ordered a Spanish beer, Estrella Damm Inedit Witbier to begin his \"journey\".  Meanwhile, our order of Jamón Ibérico Fermín with picos arrived.  It was a small plate of porky deliciousness that melted like butter as soon as it hit your tongue. The paper-thin slices were paired with crisp \"picos\" or mini breadsticks.  We both ordered the Complete Spanish Lunch that was a 3-course meal. It started with Ensalada Verde (Bibb lettuce, red onions and sherry dressing), Gazpacho estilo Algeciras (classic chilled Spanish soup made with tomato, cucumber, peppers and bread) and Paella del Dia (today's special featured chicken and mushrooms). It was a value for its price at $26 per person. Jason brought out each course in a timely succession...we weren't in a rush and had the time to savor the flavors. The food was well-seasoned and we were seated to watch the chef prepare the paella over the open-fire wood burning grill. We liked Jason's attentiveness, efficiency and positive attitude.
