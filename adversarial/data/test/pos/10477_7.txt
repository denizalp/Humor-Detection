I came to Las Vegas for a business conference and one of my managers recommended this restaurant. It is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like \"Sex and the City!\" It is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. \n\nEveryone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. I felt like I was in that movie \"Oceans 11\" with George Clooney..\n\nI came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nThey give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. It comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. It is really a tasty treat.\n\n\nSalad: They have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. It is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.\n\n\nEntrees:\n\nI ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. My waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. When they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. It was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.\n\nMy colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. \n\nWe ordered several different sides and I would rate them as the following:\n\nCreamy Corn:  This was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robust corn flavor.\n\nJalapeno Cheese Grits:   Green Jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. It had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.\n\nMushroom pot pie:    This is a great dish to order on the side. Its basically mushrooms saut√©ed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. I enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. The flavor combination was intense.\n\n\nThe wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. I forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.\n\n\nDESSERT:   They have a pistachio and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. It is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its AMAZING! It is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.\n\n\nThis is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in Vegas for a special dinner or night out with friends. One of the better Steakhouses in Las Vegas!
