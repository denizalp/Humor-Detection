Very disappointed! This was one of those epic fails where you wonder how this person would cross the street and survive it!\nOne very busy evening, with work, errands, kids karate, hit the gym and the whole shabang, My husband and u decided we're getting take out! \nWe called around to see who can accommodate our needs... # 1 wings must be baked #2 MUST be gluten free!!!\nThis place offered the smoke the wings and of course no sauce, since after going back and forth, we learned almost all their sauces have gluten in them!\nWe decided to go with the dry wings, smoked no sauce! And again confirmed that they will be gluten free and wheat free, and of course not make any contact with either or! And yes I was there next to my husband confirming the order had been under stood.\nMy husband brings home 2 containers, neither one labelled. Ok... I figured the saucy ones will be hubbys and the dry... Well obviously mine, after all that....\nI open the container to find my '2 pounds' more like 1 pound\/10 wings, sitting next to a whole bunch of fried which are clearly breaded! \nThat's ok, I must have ordered the wrong box! I opened the next box, well.... Same thing!!!\nSo wait a minute where's MY food?....\nDinner time has come and gone!\nWe called told them that happened... Well they offered me a lousy credit or another order of wings but with salad... Guess what people! The gas we spend driving our ass there and back TWICE in 1 night is not worth your scrony wings! \nTerribly disappointed!\n\nAnd the interior of this place... Well let's say I don't recommend eating in side!\n(Whole in the wall)\n\nWill update and see how attempt #2 goes.\nBy the way check out the pictures I posted as reference and see if you can tell me which are which?!?\nI've got everything near me at Weston and major Mack. Why on earth would I come back???? Even the Thai place next door had better, bigger and gluten free wings! Oh and yes; much cheaper!\n\nUPDATE: thank you rob for the update! I am very pleased to hear that the restaurant will now be taken over new ownership and renovations! Yes we will\nDefinitely consider giving the restaurant a second chance:-)
