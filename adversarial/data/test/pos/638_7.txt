I used to love Urban Dog.  When my dog was a puppy, it was a great place for him to go and spend a day when I had really long work hours.  When I'd pick him up at the end of the day, he was exhausted.  And each time we'd head over to Urban Dog, he was SO excited!  It made the hefty price tag of a full day in dogcare, which for the record is pretty much what you'd pay for a child's daycare or so I am told, seem worth it.  And I did love having a look at the webcam and seeing my pup making new dog friends.  \n\nBut as my dog got older something changed.  When we'd roll up, he didn't want to go into the building anymore.  Had my dog outgrown Urban Dog?  To begin with, Urban Dog's business must be booming since they had to put in place the requirement of reserving a space for your dog.  Thinking back, I had noticed the amount of dogs had greatly increased.  Perhaps the sheer quantity of canines in one space was the reason for my dog's discontent?  I will say the space is very large, but its airplane hanger-like quality amplifies and bounces sounds so the noise level is pretty overwhelming.  With my regular human hearing, I know I'd need ear plug to work there.  \n\nOne thing I DO NOT miss about Urban Dog when we stopped going is the notes.  Many times when I'd pick up my dog, there would be a dreaded behaviour note accompanying his food container.  Details like my dog ate another dog's poo or my dog barked too much.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do about these issues after the fact, and considering I am paying a lot to have someone look after him, I'd assume his caregivers could problem solve.  Still, I had that feeling of being scolded like parents must feel when they go to parent teacher night and find out that their kid is the class bully.
