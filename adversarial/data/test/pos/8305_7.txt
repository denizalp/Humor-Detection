Not impressed at all, even after all the hype. For being a gourmet burger restaurant on the heart of the strip of Las Vegas in the Mirage, this place does not measure up to par. However the fault and the experience was not diminished by the whole staff. Personally the only thing that was outstanding and really is the glue holding this place together is the wait staff. So humble, so attentive to your every need, not once did I have to ask for a refill. They where always there like Eve was to Adam. Thank you wait staff at the BLT Burger.\n\nNow the food was another story. See when a place like this is grinding their own meat, its something special. I decided to go with the Highway 80 burger and I told the nice waitress I wanted it cooked medium, she nicely replied that itll be pink in the middle and I nodded in reply to show that I comprehend.  Excited to have a 15 dollar burger that might be worth every penny, I  recieve a well done burger. Now what kind of chef, wait no wrong title, I meant to say cook, overcooks ground beef? Cmon man. Is it that BLT burger has gotten into the habit of what every franchise\/company does by hiring desperate underpayed, unexperience and unmotivated cooks who cant even cook meat to its appropriate temperature and serve fries that have been sitting around and where stale and cold.\n\nPlease dont make the same mistake I did. This place is over priced and is just meeting their quaterly profits by pure hype. \n\nDont try this place and thank me later.
