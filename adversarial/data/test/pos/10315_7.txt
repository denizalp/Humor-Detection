Very good sign company. I had them build and install a sign for my thrift store and they worked long hours after I closed the store up to not distract business during the day and worked until midnight to get the sign done. They constructed the sign themselves with the exact design and color I wanted, installed the sign themselves with me overlooking most of the time, they installed all the electrical to make it light up themselves, and they set the timer for the sign to light up automatically at dusk everyday themselves. Very hardworking bunch of guys that leave the client happy every time.
