I really don't like roughing it. And the most spontaneous thing about our trip was coming to grips with whether we should start heading out of Montréal at 5pm on a Friday and driving in a blizzard, -0° temperatures in real pitch dark roads for 5 and 1\/2 hours. Or.....staying over night. \n\nBut I gotta give Mr. Man some major props and did real, real good with Le Petit Hotel. (And he doesn't even Yelp!). At the 11th hour, he Google Mapped and Le Petit popped up in Old Montréal. From his end, he was able to look at their pictures and details and booked in TripAdvisor- quick. The Man finalized payment right from his phone. Bam! Boom! And that was it! \n\nThere was a small wait as the Front Desk needed to wait for the confirmation. And within about 10 minutes, Valet Service got our belongings and parked our car. Once inside, I held my breath because Le Petit is f*cking adorable, funked out, and maybe coming off as a Boutique hotel-beyond any place we've stayed in!!! Loved it. And it was just perfect! \n\nLast minute reservations weren't a problem and came through without a hitch. Front Desk? Totally warm with a genuine smile. I couldn't have asked for more. \n\nLobby is stylish and seemed like an art gallery nestled in Old Montréal's architecture. Hospitality speaking, the rooms were well equipped, clean, cozy and comfortable. Bathroom? Genius!!! Like a piece of art in and of itself. Too many details to even list them all, but it was such a worthwhile visit. \n\nHighly recommend and had a great night stay. Oh...not to mention the free continental breakfast. (Nothing totally against the last 2 hotels we stayed in- which were more expensive and did not include one). \n\nWe'll definitely stay here again and honestly, \nthe best experience, is the one that's not planned and is spontaneous.
