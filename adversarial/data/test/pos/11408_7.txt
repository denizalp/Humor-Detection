Joe is my favorite masseuse but I've brought my mom here and I advised them of her diabetes. Her therapist was so accommodating and my mom was so relaxed that they cinched my repeat customer status. I ask for Joe by name but call ahead to make sure that he is available as you might have to wait. \nPros - the lounge chairs are new and very accommodating. It's clean and I do feel comfortable. The massage is their best asset and is very good compared to other Asian foot massages I've been to. They have a storage ottoman to store your things so you don't stress on your stuff or have to get in their way while massaging you.\nCons - Their music needs to have a new rotation. Their lighting is perfectly dark up until someone walks in from outside which can ruin the mood in addition to not being able to hear ancillary conversations. I will bring headphones and my own music next time. The floors can be a little slippery from the oil\/lotion they use. The towels have seen their use so a fresh new and soft ones would be great.\nImprovement suggestions - discounts for frequent and repeat customers.   More modern soothing music. Provide for online reservations.
