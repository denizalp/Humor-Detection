ohhhhh what a pleasant, delicious, surprise this buffet was. :D Friday dinner = 14.50 per person, including soft drink, and the food is glorrrrioussss. GLORIOUS. I ate like.. 8 lbs of smoked salmon, orange roughy, marinated Mediterranean seafood salads, a few fancy raviolis, and grazed on really tasty salad, antipasti, cheeses, ceviche, AND ALL SORTS of other really delicious delicacies. YAAY. SUPER CLEAN. very well staffed, with attentive service. Cloth napkins! FANTSY. THIS is a luxury buffet, for the same price, or just a few bucks more than what one would typically pay a gross chain buffet, infested with big, scary, giant human mutant things. I cannot wait to return :D The freshness\/quality quotient is super high, and the value is stellar.
