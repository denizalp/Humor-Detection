This place was okay, it was located near everything else you could want to visit. The floor of the casino is okay mostly not the kind of place you'd go and meet new friends. The tables themselves were not 1$ stakes either. The rooms are nice the view of the roller coaster and the tops of other buildings is a diffrent matter all together.\n\nI would go back if i could get some sort of deal or special. There is a nice place to get steak and eggs in the Lobby.\n\nNote the taxi's are thieves, want to pay 40$ to go a couple of miles then this is the spot to find them as well. So angry.
