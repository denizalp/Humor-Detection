Most of the instructors in the Respiratory Therapy program, with the exception of the physician on staff and one of the female instructors -- are very negative and pick their favorites when it comes to passing people.  They are very political and I have never encountered a program where in order to pass, they must like you.  Otherwise they will set you up to fail.  Instructors are supposed to encourage you, not bring you down like these instructors do. \n\nIn personal experience, they had driven multiple people to go to another RRT school due to the favortism for other students. They have been known to change grades for students to pass and set up the ones that they strongly dislike to fail. I have even passed a class and they claimed that I didn't pass and I had to bring the syllabus and catalog\/handbook to the head of the school to fight this controversy and needless to say, they have been after me ever since.  Apparently, if you ask to clarify something about previous information you've learned and you have the book to back you up, making the instructor incorrect in his teachings, they will punish you relentlessly instead of praising you for reading and actually LEARNING and REMEMBERING what you learned from previous classes.\n\nAs heard from several medical professionals that I have spoken with in a few hospitals around here in the Las Vegas area...I wouldn't want a Pima student to take care of me and be responsible for my life due to the fact that they were passed because they were a nice person.  I want the RRT that passed because they understood the material and knows what to do in the event of saving my life.\n\nI am currently working on possibly filing a complaint with the accreditation agencies against this school due to the unfairness and lack of professionalism that was greatly displayed and would like to gather more people for a bigger complaint.  There's more power in numbers, right?
