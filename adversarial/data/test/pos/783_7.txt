Here's a nice story for you. I've ordered pizzas online through zpizza in the past, so they had my contact information. They sent me an email containing a coupon for one free pizza on my birthday, which was coming up shortly. I went in to redeem my coupon later on a weeknight. One of the two employees working at the time told me that since the coupon came from their corporate office in California, I would have to go there to receive my free pizza. What a jackass. He was a young, hipster-looking guy. Pretty sure he was wearing a backwards baseball cap.\n\nLOCATION: Only good thing about the place, it's downtown. Good atmosphere.\nPRICE: Too high for everything. Pizza's expensive, beer's expensive.\nSERVICE: Did you read my story above? Every other employee has been pleasant, but this guy really made me angry. \n\nI cannot recommend zpizza because of the terrible experience I had there. I steer all of my friends away from this place. Better experience at Brooklyn's NYC Pizza or the new place that just opened up, I forget the name. Both are located a couple blocks from zpizza at 2nd Street and Washington.
