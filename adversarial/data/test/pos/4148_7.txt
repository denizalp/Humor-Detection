We used Nightlife Limo for the party bus a few years ago. It was freaking awesome. The driver was smart and funny. We drove around Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe. 5 hours on a bus filled with drinks and friends... what a way to spend a evening. \n\nWe have been on 2 of the buses and they were both great. Clean, sound systems were good, and safe.
