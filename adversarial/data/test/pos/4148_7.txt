I have been a Tradsource member since November 2012. I cannot tell you how much this barter club has increased my business and put me in touch with clients who are fun to work with.  It took a bit to learn the ins and outs of exactly how it would work for my panting business but when I did,  yooza!  If you have a restaurant, small business call me and let me share how valuable this has been for me.  It makes dollars and sense.  602 550 2121  Kathleen
