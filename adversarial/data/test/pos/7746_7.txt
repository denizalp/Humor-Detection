I bought a Groupon like many others for this bakery. Luckily I called in advance to ask hours and was told to order my mini cupcakes 48 hours before pickup as they don't stock mini cupcakes everyday. They are a specialty item or a groupon promo only.\nI forgot to print out my Groupon and was disappointed that the owner wouldn't take it on my iphone or write down the number like all the other businesses I have used Groupon for. The lady on the phone had been a little curt and seemed put out by my order. However, she did agree to make my dozen of mixed flavors in 48 hours. Originally she had said she need 3 or more days but when I said only a dozen, she agreed to 2 days notice. I don't really get the difference if you are baking anyways. Also, you are allowed only 4 flavors with the Groupon which isn't specified on the coupon itself but in the discussion on the Groupon board. \nMy sister and I drove north to this bakery from my  home in Summerhill to check it out. Was it worth the drive? Nope.\nThe first thing you notice on walking in and the only good thing so far, is that it smells delicious and the aromas are fantastic. They are definitely baking in here. I also liked that unlike the other bakeries I visited, I couldn't see the bakers and the paperwork, etc., everywhere. The bakery has a store front and seating that is clean, spacious and pleasant. \nThe owner was on the phone when we arrived and having quite the conversation and I didn't want to interrupt her. It sounded intense. She did finally get off the phone and come over.\nOnce she spoke to us, she was nice except for charging me $27 plus dollars for my mini cupcakes. The bakery is Kosher and Parve. They have macarons, marshmallow, sponge candy and meringues. \nThe taste test -\nRed Velvet is likely the nastiest I have ever had anywhere. My sister agrees and we  threw them out after sampling one.  Tastes overpoweringly of soy which they admitted to using after we questioned. YUCK!\nChocolate wasn't bad. The frosting however, is mocha which is kind of surprising if you don't want coffee or just wanted chocolate. Tastes ok.\nCaramel was very tasteless and we weren't even sure what it was until I recalled that the owner had said caramel. It wasn't awful just forgettable and meh!\nThe apple cinnamon was the only one we liked. The cake was moist and tasty. It wasn't too cinnamony and the frosting was light and didn't taste of soy. This is the only flavor of the ones we tried that we agreed we would eat again.\nI have decided to try and refund my groupon.\nThe macarons are shipped in from the US Bo and Bon and apparently quite good but we didn't get to try them
