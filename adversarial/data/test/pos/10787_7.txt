Two words. Banana. Peel. Let me set it up for you. \n\nAfter the first of the year I decided I was going to eat six protein packed meals a day. In Scottsdale for a recent work gathering I packed some fruit in my bag to help me get the day started off on the right note. A day in to my stay and HI, I downed a banana, and rather than put the slippery peel in the garbage can so housekeeping would have to wipe out the can, I placed it on a dirty napkin and next to some dirty silverware I used the day prior. I returned to the hotel at about 5:15 and much to my surprise the banana peel was still there. Odd. Right? I went down to the desk, asked whether or not the rooms get \"cleaned\" or if housekeeping just changes the sheets...towels...etc...and she said that it was weird that somebody wouldn't remove the peel, napkin, and silverware. On my way out to dinner she said she'd alert housekeeping and I was on my merry way. Back from dinner and drinks it's certain to be gone, right? Nope. Still there. Slept through night, asked again in the morning, and I was told housekeeping leaves at a certain time so it was likely they left for the day. To which I thought, send someone else! Not pleased.\n\nIn addition, my room  was really loud, had a stale almost mildewy sort of odor and wasn't too impressive compared to other places I've stayed in Scottsdale.\n\nKnow Before You Go:\n\nCheck prices at Hotel Valley Ho or Kimpton Firesky, it might be worth the extra dough for a room with more character and a more attentive staff.
