This is a review for just the Road Kill Grill - not the butcher.  I assume Road Kill Grill should have its own listing but since everyone is posting here about it, I might as well do it too.\n\nSo - I read the story on John Curtas's site that Road Kill Grill never existed until DDD made it up for good television.  I'm confused as to why that would happen, but I think it's interesting.\n\nSince I've had to be on the North - NW side of town lately I thought I would jet over and try it.  I wasn't mostly very impressed with anything I tried, the ribs were dry and the sides were forgettable and I ended up throwing all that stuff away after a few bites.  I also want to point out that there is literally not a vegetable based side on the menu.\n\nHowever, I had the chicken and it was heavenly.  I will come back just for this.  It had a dry rub, and the BBQ sauce was in a self serve area on the side, which I got a little to taste and was fine.  But I prefer a more vinegar based sauce because regular sauce has too much sugar.  I did like being able to control whatever sauce I wanted to put on it, as I mostly opted to not have any at all.\n\nSo while I can honestly say there's no good BBQ in town, I really did love the chicken here more than others I have tried.  This includes Famous Dave's, Lucilles, Buzz, Memphis, etc.  I get cravings for it, and I wish they would sell it ala carte on the menu without all those sides.
