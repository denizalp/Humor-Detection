We live in Mooresville and we make the ever-so-treacherous drive to Huntersville (a whole whopping ~10 miles) when we want GOOD CHINESE. \n\nWhile it's not really that far, it's further than we typically go because Mooresville and Lake Norman have such fantastic dining options. Plus, on a weekday, around dinner time (with rush-hour traffic) it takes a solid 30+ minutes to get there. The other thing to note, is that anyone can get Chinese basically in at least one place within every two square miles of any mildly populated local. But, this is by far, our favorite!\n\nIt's surprisingly large and a bit hidden off exit 25 - behind Bob Evan's and BB&T on the left before you get to Birkdale. But, I believe they make a killing just by word of mouth - and Yelp of course. So I give it 5 stars for consistent quality, speed and flavor.\n\nNow, what do I recommend...? Well, we love their scallion chicken (it's my husband's favorite, he gets it without the scallions\/onions). It comes with white rice and is always served with a delicious crisp exterior and the perfect amount of sauce (if you eat it on site that is), and somehow the middle is still moist. The quality of the chicken is average, but it's always tasty. TIP: If you ever get this to go, order the sauce on the side! Night and day difference when you get it to go this way.\n\nI love their Mu Shu chicken... I've always been a sucker for a good Mu Shu, and I find quality Mu Shu hard to find. Typically, theirs is not too oily (like some places) and they give you a decent quantity and mix of meat and chicken. Like most Chinese places that serve Mu Shu, they give you an oddly small amount of pancakes. I think they charge me 25 cents for each extra pancake, and I usually get 3-4 extra pancakes. Plus, I often ask for extra sauce (it's called hoisin sauce), especially if it's to go - they'll give you the tiniest little container otherwise.\n\nFor appetizers, I love their crab rangoon. Personally, I only like my crab rangoon with the bright red sweet & sour sauce. Here, they only give you duck sauce (made with duck of course! .... kidding!) So I always ask for the sauce, which they of course charge me at least $1 for.\n\nIn terms of price, it's not super expensive, but it's also not cheap. We usually leave having paid between $30-40 including tip. I am a stickler for discounts and bargains, but this place is so good, I have no qualms about going without a coupon (which I've never seen for this place, and trust me, I've looked.)\n\nNet, this place has really excellent Chinese. They 'nickel & dime' you for the little things, but I keep going back which says a lot. ...especially if you know me. \n\nGive it a try; you will not be disappointed.\n\nNote to management, PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN MOORESVILLE!!!! (That would be amazing!)
