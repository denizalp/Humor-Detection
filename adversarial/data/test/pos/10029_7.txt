Went looking for an Eagle's bar and found one over by East Las Vegas. Decided to give it a try despite the area being a little run down. It's a dive bar and there were quite a few people there already. Was told to pick any seats that were available. Found one on the other side of the bar. Waiter was a guy who was friendly and did his best to take our order and any new customers coming in. \n\nMenu is straight to the point with some East Coast staples like scrapple and crab fries. Scrapple is like a meat loaf product made of pork leftovers mixed with garlic powder, spices, cornmeal and\/or buckwheat. It's usually shaped into a loaf and you cut them into slices and pan fry the slices. Traditionally served with mustard or grape jelly. Seeing that on the menu is cool, but as I learned in my personal food experience- traditional foods-unless the place is known for it, it's probably best to just stick to the basics. So I went for the burger with American cheese and fries. My significant other had the burger with crab fries, but no veggies on the burger. Note: crab fries are french fries with Old Bay seasoning. Ordered a diet soda and water. The diet soda came out and it tasted terrible. It had a sharp vinegar like sourness. Just bad. Maybe the syrup or soda gun it came from is questionable, but had to take it back to the bar. Barkeep gave regular soda and it didn't taste as bad, but not fresh either. Water tasted fine though. Decided to order beer in a bottle as well. Burger came out and it was white American cheddar cheese. Pretty sure it was because I had to look at the menu again, but menu said American. Maybe I'm just used to American cheese being yellow unless otherwise indicated. I took a bite out of my burger and as I was eating I turned my burger around because the tomatoes and lettuce was slipping out. Sadly, there were 2 bright green mold spots on my tomatoes. I took all the veggies out and inspected my burger patty. The meat and bread looked ok. I was so disappointed. I actually ate most of my remaining burger, but kept thinking about how everything was like a red flag. The sour tasting soda, the moldy tomatoes, and how a bar full of people, but a lot of people were not actually eating. Maybe the loyal customers know better because there were only about 3 people eating and it was just fries. \n\nThe patrons were generally friendly cheering on the team as they scored. No one was rude and our waiter was doing his best given what he was working with. They do ask for a credit or debit card to open a tab even though we weren't drinking a lot. I thought that was kind of weird, but must be policy because they asked the same of the couple that came in after us. The one star is for the guy waiter who was working hard. He didn't have control over the food he was given to the customer. He even asked, \"How was everything?\" I just said, \"It's ok.\" We did ask to close out our tab shortly after the food and he quickly did so. \n\nI don't mind dive bars or places that are not trendy or in the best of neighborhoods because I think one should keep an open mind. However, I don't like it when the place actually lives up into the stereotype of a dive bar-not clean, iffy food, and no pride in what's being served. My experience was not good, so I don't recommend. Maybe just ok to watch the game, but not much else.
