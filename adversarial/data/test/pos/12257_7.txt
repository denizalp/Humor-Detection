Studio Movie Grill is the perfect place to kill two (or possibly three) birds with one stone. Dinner, a movie, and even drinks!\n\nMy wife and I miraculously had an entire day to ourselves, and we decided to go to the movies. We ended up catching a matinee, which ran us $7.00 per ticket. I had been here before, but my wife had not. She was impressed to find out that you actually have to select your seats (much like buying a plane ticket) before you pay for your tickets. \n\nThe theater has two seating options: you can sit at a bar area (one long bar traversing the theater), or you can sit in a big comfy chair with a rotating tray attached to the armrest. The theater alternates these seating options every other row. We opted for the super comfy lounge chairs. They were spacious, soft, and offered plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable...which is a huge plus when you're over six feet tall, and your wife is just shy of it. Suffice it to say, this was the first time I think both of us were genuinely comfortable in movie theater seat.\n\nAt each seat, there's a red button you can press to let your waiter know you're ready to place your order, be it food or drinks. They have a full menu for both, it appears. We still had things to do that day, so we opted for sodas (free refills) and a barbecue chicken pizza. The pizza was REALLY good. It came cut into six relatively small slices, which ended up dividing perfectly between the two of us. Not only that, but it came out quite quickly.\n\nAs for the theater, we couldn't have been more pleased. The seats are all big enough and spaced far enough apart, you're pretty much in your own little world. The screen is large, and equally visible from every seat in the house. Couple that with an awesome sound system and you're ready to be whisked away into a magical world of make-believe (depending on your taste and choice in movies, of course).\n\nIf you or anyone you know is anything like us, picking places for dinner or a movie can be an absolute battle of attrition...let alone picking BOTH. Thanks to Studio Movie Grill, at least the location is something upon which everyone can agree. After that, the choices are up to you!
