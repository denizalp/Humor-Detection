If a promoter gives you and three dude friends \"VIP passes\" as you're walking by, you should probably just keep walking.\n\nWell, once upon a time, I was 21 and inexperienced about Vegas clubs. Look guys, we got VIP passes! No wait or cover! You live and learn.\n\nI remember walking in around 1 AM, scoping out the scene, and wondering why this place was so empty. Was there even a DJ playing? I don't recall. Why did everyone look so miserable? Are all Vegas clubs this small?\n\nWe dipped about 10 minutes later. \n\nVegas has so many awesome clubs. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
