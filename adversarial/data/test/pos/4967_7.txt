Ended up at this Mimi's Cafe while on business in Phoenix.  I remember liking Mimi's Cafe since they're all over Los Angeles, but it's been awhile since stepping into one.  With all the various coffee shops and new establishments customers now have when wanting breakfast, Mimi's will need to up their game.  Interior appears old fashioned and the food isn't that good.  Eggs and breakfast meats were greasy, tasteless and accompanied by soggy bread even when it came toasted.  Muffins are still rather moist and good so perhaps that with a cup of coffee might be your best bet.  Service was okay but perhaps when needing a breakfast location, especially to discuss business, I'll opt for an overall better place.
