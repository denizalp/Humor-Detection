Arcadia Tavern is one of my top five favorite places to wash sports in the Valley. With a bar on the right side and restaurant style seating on the left side, it's a solid sports bar for either a family or young professionals looking to have some cocktails and bar food.  Since I am kid-less, I normally hang out on the right side. If people complain about walking into empty bars in the Valley, then head over to Arcadia Tavern because on a game night, chances are you won't be able to find an empty seat there. But don't let that deter you because it's worth staying for a seat to open up. \n\nI like Arcadia Tavern for several types of occasions: if I'm looking for a place to watch the game, to have some food and drinks before going out or to eat lunch on a weekend afternoon. The patio is great and when the weather's nice, it's a must visit. Arcadia Tavern is in a random location within Arcadia but it's perfect neighborhood joint with so many houses nearby. Parking can be a bit tough so you might want to park across the street and walk. \n\nAs for food, this is your classic neighborhood bar so it has all American food. The burger is great and I normally go for the BBQ chicken sandwich. If you're a fan of nachos, give those a try. \n\nSo if you're looking for a neighborhood bar with TVs and a fun atmosphere, you should check out Arcadia Tavern.
