Stopped thru for lunch on a Monday and it turned out to be a pretty good move. I Chose the #3 (burro meal) w chips\/salsa n jamaica to drink.. The carne was grilled and seasoned nicely, hold the beans Por fav√≤r.... No complaints on the burrito at all, flavor and ingredients were fresh and to my liking. Chips n salsa were plentiful and actually more than enough.. I prefer the green tomatillo sauce rather than the red.. They do it fresh here and seemed to be on point. Ordered up n paid n food was brought out to table several minutes later after the chips n salsa... Id recommend this placed ur in the area and I'll def be back to try more items on the menu. Seems to be a \"go to\" spot for those that \"know what's up\"! Jamaica was on ice and helped finish Monday's lunch off!! Good move, get it in at this spot if r in this side of town! Look forward to trying more of their menu items.. Lots of seating and inside decor is welcoming and quaint..
