I shop here, yes, but that doesn't mean this is not a wasteland of lost souls, a spectacular cavern of nothingness and need, a vast warehouse filled with caloric lack of potential. Every time I go here, I find myself losing little bits and pieces of myself. I find myself watching as others are forced to resign themselves to the mediocrity of this oversized shopping experience.
