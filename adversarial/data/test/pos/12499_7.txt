Im always down to try new places I havnt been to especially when its teriyaki!\n\nHere I ordered the chicken\/beef combo. Comes with vegetables and a drink for around 6 bucks and change. The chicken was a bit dry and the beef was tender. The teriyaki sauce they drizzle on the food was ok. I thought it lacked a little bit of that sweet taste that compliments the saltiness of the soy sauce. The veggies were a bit soggy like it was overcooked a bit. \n\nService wise the Chinese lady that took my order was ok. Even though she spoke english, she still had a strong accent. Kind of reminds me of some of my aunts when they talk to me (im Filipino by the way). It almost sounds like she is mad when she talks but I know she isnt because that is what im used to. Anyways, after I ordered, a white dude came in and started asking questions about the menu since it was his first time. For the next 5 minutes, I dont know if they were arguing or fighting because since the Chinese lady talks like she is mad, the white dude kind of raised his voice to match the tone of the Chinese lady. In the end, the white dude just turned around and left with a disgusted look on his face. I was kind of shaking my head because I wasnt sure exactly what went down. Because of that, I didnt seem to enjoy my food as much as I wanted on top of it not tasting as good as I wanted it to be.\n\nWhile I was there, there were a group of girls that ordered smoothies with boba. I asked them if it was any good. They said they come here all the time to have their boba fix. So I thought I would give it a try since they recommeded it. I orderd avocado since that was my favorite. Once I took a sip I was really disappointed. The boba was good but the drink was way too sweet! \n\nAs for the overall observance of the place, well they have different posters on their walls that are for sale if you wanted it. A couple examples are Jet Li and Bruce Lee. They also had a separate glass counter that had all sorts of trinkets in it that was for sale also. The size of the place was pretty decent with about 6 medium sized tables and enough chairs.\n\nOverall, I wasnt too impressed. The next time im in the area I might give these guys another try. Maybe the ambiance and food will be better.
