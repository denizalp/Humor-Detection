Nothing pains me more than to go to a mall on the weekend, especially South Park Mall with their aggressive kiosk employees, but I had a Groupon for a eyebrow threading sesh and some caterpillars sitting above my eyes so game on. I thought it would be packed being a Saturday afternoon and all but only had to wait five minutes and then and few threads later--a new me with a hint of an eyebrow arch! Mad props to the threading lady who didn't wince when she saw the mass furriness that my eyebrows have become in the past month and for being so efficient. This is one of the cheaper places I have found in Charlotte and love threading because it's not painful at all. As others have said, you sit there while others pass you by but they have a small division so you're not there right in the open. \n\nOh yeah, they have a punch card, I love any place that rewards you for visits. Men and women alike should take their furry features to Brow Bar for a quick fix!
