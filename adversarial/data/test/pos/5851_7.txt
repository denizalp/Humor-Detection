I love bringing the kids to this place for the Holidays. It's deck out all nice, there's tons to do and it's a safe warm indoor environment to have a family fun night and best of all it's all for FREE what is there to complain about. It might not be an actual \"Santa's Wonderland\" but your not in the North Pole either so check your reality people. Some people SMH!\n\nAnyways Bass Pro shop puts on a great place to creat some great holiday memories from year to year I think. They have some of the same set up so if you've been here before you've been here already but of you live near by or not and just love the place why not come and have some fun. The store turns Xmas every year with nightly activity through out the week. There's plenary of parking and sometimes hot coco is sold out front. \n\nYou can have your pictures taken with Santa for free or buy one of their super affordable package. While someone holds your place in line the kids can have their choice of tons of things to do. Color at the craft tables, write a letter to Santa and put it in the mail box, watch Christmas cartoons, shoot ducks, conduct a train or drive a remote car. Regardless there's lots to do and lots to see.  So if you haven't been here and can make the drive I think it's totally worth it.
