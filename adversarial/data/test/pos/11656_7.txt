I grew up in Brooklyn and the one thing I'm missing in Scottsdale is a good Kosher-style deli.  Abe's met that need, and met my expectations!  We each ordered a \"junior\" sandwich which is 6 oz of meat in a sandwich half.  I had the pastrami on rye and my daughter ordered the corned beef on challah.  They were both exactly how I expected them and how I remembered these sandwiches from growing up.  My only \"issue\" (not serious at all) is that I wish the menu mentioned that the \"junior\" is a half-sandwich.  We just expected each to be a full sandwich with \"only\" 6 oz of meat in total, and planned on sharing each half-sandwich.  It was a lot more difficult to cut the half sandwich in half.  \n\nWe were served sour and half-sour pickles when we sat down, and since I have a very difficult time finding anything but dill pickles in Scottsdale, we finished the pickles before we even ordered our sandwiches - no worries - our waiter quickly brought over more pickles.\n\nNow I'm going to have to go back with my husband!
