Came here because of the novelty- come on, who doesn't like bacon?!? But we'll definitely return because they offer decent pub\/bar food with plenty of beer and unique cocktails to try. \nI also applaud their appetizer selection. So many to choose from! The garlic knots looked amazing, but we tried the spicy green beans. Battered deep fried and spicy - absolutely delicious! And they're vegetables, so they're healthy- right? Hahah, right. \nBacon Burger- a 60\/40 mix of beef & bacon patty, served on a croissant bun. So good! The caramelized onions added a perfect amount of sweetness. \nAnd substitute the fries for garlic fries- you'll thank me later. \nSo in the end- this little piggy squealed happily all the way home.
