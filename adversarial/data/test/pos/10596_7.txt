I went to the location at First Markham Place to get a ring resized. They said they could attach a ball to the inside of the ring for $40. We said sure, but when we went to pick it up, there was basically no change to the ring size, it was still super loose. Not only that, but the ring now had discolouration on the outside from where they attached the ball. I can't believe they just gave it back to us like that. When we tried it on and told them it didn't fit, they said there was nothing else they could do. And we received no compensation for the fact that they ruined our $300 band.\n\nNow my husband's ring still doesn't fit and it looks absolutely awful with random splotches of dark metal around it. Just looking at it makes me angry.
