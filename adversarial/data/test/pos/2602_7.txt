Who would have thunk that Bobby's Burger Palace smack dab in the City Center on the Vegas Strip and not attached or associated with a casino would be one of the most affordable places to eat at!  Hat's off to Mr Flay!  Mind you the prices were on average $2.21 more than what the email menu I received from Bobby's news letter was but at $9 per burger that is still cheap in Vegas terms :)\n\nThe location is mid sized but makes good use of space with cool cafeteria style bench seating.  There is probably room for around 100 people or so.  The ordering system is cafeteria style as well, ordering at the register and then having your food brought out to you.\n\nThe menu is fairly basic other than the 5 or six gourmet burgers offered.  I think there was a grilled cheese on the menu, sweet potato fries, regular fries, onion rings, milk shakes and frozen alcoholic drinks as well.\n\nWe sampled the following:\n\nLa Burger: about a 1\/3 pound super juicy burger served with your choice of cheese and a avocado relish.  The burger was tasty and filling $9.00.\n\nCrunch Burger: a cheese burger served with potato chips inside. My daughter loved this burger saying it was one of the best she has ever had.  You can \"crunchify\" any burger for a small charge.  $8.50\n\nDallas Burger: a cheese burger served with coleslaw and bbq sauce.  Juicy tender and cooked to perfection this was a good burger $9.00\n\nOnion Rings: super wide cut onion rings in a light batter.  The rings were very juicy when you bit into them but didn't come with any special dipping sauce and could have used more seasoning in the batter $4.00\n\nSweet Potato Fries: a large portion of tasty fries served with a honey mustard dipping sauce, could have been crispier but they were good $4.00\n\nDark Chocolate Milk Shake: a thick tasty shake, but not worth $6.50\n\nOverall we really enjoyed this place.  The burgers are not the best on the strip but they are certainly the most affordable gourmet burger on the strip.  Stay away from the over priced shakes and you will leave here with a full belly and some spare cash in your wallet :)
