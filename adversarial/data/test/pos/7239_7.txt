Really overrated as far as vegan cheese goes, would not repurchase. There are so many options out there right now.\nThey all have strong lemon flavors & their quality suffers when frozen (which is how most suppliers sell them).\nPlus, these people are super unprofessional on IG, it left a bad taste in my mouth. They respond back angrily to people's constructive criticism & tried to get Yelp to remove my negative review! I bet they will even reply to this review, LOL.
