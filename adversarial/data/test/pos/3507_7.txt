I recently went to this club with my husband around mid April ... cus we still party like that... *laughs to myself\n\nIt was our first time here and we had a great time. Out of all the popular clubs in Vegas, we've had the best experience at the Marquee. IMO, it's way better than that Omnia sardine can and less expensive than XS on drinks... I don't even want to talk about Hakkasan. Suffice to say that although the place can get crowded, the crowd was a good crowd, the music was great, the entertainment was great and the prices were just right for Vegas. \n\nI don't know about all these rooms people have mentioned; I couldn't find them... But then I was heavily enjoying myself on the tiny dance floor to even look for them. The patio was closed (for shame, as I really needed the air). I also don't remember going through this flight of stairs I've read about. The process was fast and pretty smooth from what I remember.\n\nWhat else... Yes, the bartenders were pretty cool & didn't mind keeping me hydrated with free h20. We met an awesome couple from Britain and some other folk whom we partied with long after the after hours club had ended. So yes, I do recommend going to this club. \n\nAlso, bouncers can be douchey but we always pay for entry to avoid waiting on these clowns & diminish their sense of power. But if you're in a pickle, the guest list line was working pretty fast even though it was very long... I mean, who isn't on the guest list these days, ya know... But beware, I did see some girls get turned away for no obvious reason at the door & if you're still reading this we should probably party together
