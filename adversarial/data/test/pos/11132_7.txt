Every time I come here, I feel like Goldilocks. This business space has been three boba supply slash drink stores in the past year, and every time they reopen under a different name, something is always off (too sweet, too bland, poor service, etc.).\n\nThis incarnation, the store has a modernized interior with the boba supply organized and separate from the boba dining area. Menu has about 50 drink options (milk teas and smoothies), no foods. Two sizes for drinks, small and large, priced at $4 and $5.50, respectively. The large is huge.\n\nBut my experience with the banana milk tea was that the drink itself was poorly mixed (gritty powder at the bottom), extremely artificial tasting with a poor aftertaste, with mushy boba. I can't say I'm a fan, but it was only one drink. Service this visit was a tremendous step up from the last... but I'm still waiting to have an experience that is \"just right\".
