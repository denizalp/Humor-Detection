This is the second location in the GTA. I used to frequent the young\/bloor location when we lived downtown. So I was excited to find out they opened the second location in Markham.\nWe went for lunch today. Lunch menu is very good value. $7 for 2 rolls (simpler rolls, of course not the specialty ones) and miso soup. Lunch boxes came with soup and salad. We had 4 rolls (California, tempura, spicy salmon, and Boston) and a salmon lover lunch special to share between 2 of us. We were both stuff. Agedashi tofu was delish; fresh warm and flavourful. \nOverall, sushi was fresh and good value for lunch. I have to come back to try their specialty rolls so I can compare it with the downtown location.
