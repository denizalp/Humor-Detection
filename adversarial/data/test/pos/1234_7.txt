Let me start by saying any business that has 99cent coronas instantly gets my vote. I had a chicken burrito, it was delicious. Our waitress was super friendly. The place was pretty empty, but they also just opened a few weeks ago. The food was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try some of the seafood next time I'm craving Mexican food.
