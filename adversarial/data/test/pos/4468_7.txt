Talk about cognitive dissonance!\n\nI love the idea behind this place: authentic cuisine, art adorning the walls, innovative cuisine, no-frills attitude, and a James Beard nominated chef!\n\nHere's what kills this place: Gabe. He is one of the worst servers I have had in a while. He killed the experience, made us want to leave in a hurry, and, in essence, ruined a nice dinner.  \n\nDetails of the food\/drinks:\n-Beers were $4.75. Hubby got the House Margarita and, while he did say they were poured weakly, it was quite refreshing and used a great mix.\n-Quesadilla with Langostine Borracho: My favorite dish of the evening.  It didn't arrive \"quesdilla\" style at all.  We had 4 small tortillas topped with the grilled langostine and wonderfully flavorful chunks of goat cheese; there was a flavorful pico de gallo in the center.  It was totally unexpected and totally good.\n-Cochinita Pibil: everyone raves about this dish.  It was very well prepared, with slow-roasted pork, freshly made tortillas, sour-orange onions, a wonderful mashed potatoes made with Chipotle peppers (which I found out from a food runner since Gabe was MIA), and an interesting vegetable to go with the asparagus. I think this vegetable is the Chayote, from listening to another waiter explain things to his guests with great enthusiasm (cue jealous looks now).  With all this, something didn't quite add up in the dish.  The flavors didn't come together and wow me.\n-Chicken Mole: The mole sauce was nice, with a good complexity, but there was hardly any sauce on the plate.  Nicely cooked pieces of chicken wrapped up in tortillas, with mole and a cream sauce drizzled over the top. More Chayote and Asparagus.  Good but not great.\n\nNow onto Gabe.  Ooh! I'm still so mad!  He was gruff, inattentive, and just rude.  When I asked if they had pitchers of beer, I got a brusque \"No,\" as he looked down his nose at me.  The hubby ordered his drink, and I said I'd like another minute.  That was a mistake. 5 minutes later he brings the hubby's margarita and doesn't ask if I'd like anything; he just walked away.  As we flagged his down to order our appetizer, I was finally allowed to order a glass of water and a beer.  We had to flag him down for everything. And when the option of dessert came up, he rattled them off to us, without explaining them and, when we weren't ready to decide yet, left again.  A wonderful young lady who boxed up our food brought us a menu so we could read about the desserts.  I was so mad that I didn't want to pay 12 bucks for a dessert and have to deal with Gabe any longer.\n\nOverall final thoughts:\n-Innovative chef, with interesting ideas. Some cohesiveness is missing from some dishes though.\n-Fix Gabe. Seriously. He ruined our night! Other servers were warm, friendly, answered questions, checked on their guests, etc.\n-Prices are a bit steep. I'm not cheap by any means, but I felt like we paid a lot and didn't receive quite the same in return.  \n-Seriously about Gabe.
