This place has a cool, retro chic thing going for it as far the interior is concerned but all the loveliness ends there.   First off, the entrance is kind of awkward.  As soon as you walk into the \"bistro\" you are in the middle of the restaurant traffic pathway.  It is a small place and you feel somewhat cramped and there was no host\/hostess in sight.  One of the bartenders greeted us and let us pick our spot (there weren't too many options) so we sat by the door.  The bartender took our drink order (which by the way they only serve half bottles of wine but still charge full bottle prices) and then said the waitress would be right over to get our food order.  We perused the menu several times and were still waiting on the waitress to come our way.  She passed by us many times but seemed too concerned with the other tables.  Finally we palce our order after the bartender had to tell her many times that we were ready.  We split a salad and then placed an order of the Buffalo stax and the \"build your own\" beef stax.  They never asked how we wanted them cooked and to be quite honest it did not dawn on us until we were eating them but mine arrived \"very well done\" and my boyfriend's arrived raw in the middle and burned on the outside.  Needless to say we were upset but very hungry and ate what we could.  \n\nI think the staff is too preoccupied with keeping a trendy Scottsdale image that they lack quality on the food and service level.  It's quite a shame b\/c the location is great and they would have no problem keeping regulars coming to an overpriced burger joint.  I would never go back here again.  The meal made both me and my boyfriend ill before we made it home (only 10 minutes away).\n\nIf you want an overpriced but yummy burger then go to Deluxe Burger!
