Had lunch here today with my husband and son. We love Indian food. We were happy to see hey offered a lunch buffet until we approached it. Very few choices. The dishes that had chicken in them barely had any chicken in them. The sauces were all unusually runny. Plain naan only. They won't make garlic naan. I live chai tea! I tried theirs. This is not chai tea. It was the right color. However the smell was off. After taking my first sip I discovered it was bitter with a strong lemony hint.
