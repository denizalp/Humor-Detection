This place has always been pricey but I used to think the food, at least, was worth it. I haven't been there in a while and just went last night. although the food was tasty, the portions were like the size of appetizers. I had a tiny little burrito with an ice cream scoop full of salad. My husband had some tasty chicken with an ice cream scoop's worth of  mashed potatoes. My son had a side of fries. We split a beer. With tip we couldn't get out of there for under $62.\nI think you're just paying for the location of the restaurant; a busy corner in Old Town Scottsdale. It was so dark I couldn't even see the food I was eating. I had to turn my flashlight on to see what was on my plate.\n\nTwo stars because the service was pretty good and the food was good but I would not go back there.
