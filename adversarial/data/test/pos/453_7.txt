I transplanted here from Western NYS right after Bills went 0-4 in Superbowl attempts.  Yes, it still hurts.  Lebowski's understands this and provides their form of healing with booze, wings, beef-on-a-weck, and fried haddock (no, not Cod.  They understand).  When I'm feeling I need a little hug from home,  I drop in and rekindle my spirit with their's.  \n\nService has always been spot on, the food hot and homey, and the price easy on the cash flow.  Go Bill's.  Go Lebowski's.  And, go Panther's, of course!
