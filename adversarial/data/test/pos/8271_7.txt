As noted on some of the reviews, this place has awful customer service!  They gave me a handicap room and I didn't realize it until the day I checked out.  I had to check out early because there were two roaches in the shower one morning.  Housekeeping came and got rid of the roaches and then mentioned that the place was accomodated for handicapped people.  No wonder the shower didn't have a tub!  I complained to the manager and her excuse was roaches happen all the time.  There was no offer to compensate for our experience.  I had about 4 days left out of 7 days and I rather check out earlier and lose out on the money i paid for rather than stay at that resort another few days and not be able to sleep because I'm worried the roaches might crawl into my bed.  I will never go back there again, even if they offered me a free week.
