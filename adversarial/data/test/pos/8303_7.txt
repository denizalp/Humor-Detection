Whew!  What a work out!\n\nThis place is really fun!! Jumping on trampolines makes you sweat you booty off; especially with good music playing!!  It's so much fun it doesn't feel like a work out.\n\nThe outside of the building looks like a big industrial warehouse-type setting.  You can't tell what's inside by the look of the outside, so don't be fooled!\n\nWhen you walk in, you are greeted by the really cheery and friendly staff.  If you've never been there before, they explain to you how the whole thing works and they tell you what you need in order to get your jump on.\n\nThere are 3 sections (from what I observed).  The first section is for toddlers, the second one is for adults and they have another part sectioned off for trampoline dodge ball and other activities that this place hosts.  By looking at the pamphlets and pictures on the wall, I saw that they have a kick boxing or work out class that they do as well!\n\nI was hesitant to try it out, we gave it a shot and I had a blast!!  If they had one by where I live, I would definitely sign up or visit the facility all the time!\n\nI will definitely come back to this place when I am in town!
