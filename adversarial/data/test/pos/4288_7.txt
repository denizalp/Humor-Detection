I've been to mercbar many times, and I have to say that sometimes it's a5 star experience and sometimes it's a 1 star experience. The issue is the bartenders, a good Bartender makes it a 5 star experience, last night however was terrible service. There was 10 people in the whole bar, but the male Bartender seemed more interested in sleeping with the guy in front of him than he was in serving us drinks. HIRE BETTER BARTENDERS.
