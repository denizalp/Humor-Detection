I read recently that people call coming into the city through the Fort Pitt Tunnels as a Yinzgasm.  And I can see it...or maybe more so I have seen it.  It's what makes sitting in the horrible backed up traffic so worth it.\n\nI would say that this is Pittsburgh's front door.  If people call Point State Park our welcoming mat, this has to be the city's front door.  It's like the city of Pittsburgh is saying, \"Hello, welcome to City of Bridges.  Named the 'Best Place to Live' several times.\"  \n\nI'm sure anyone visiting this city for the first time are very impressed when they come here from the airport.  It's one asset that we are lucky to have.
