Excessive Make Up Hostess was really rude, a robot would show more genuine courtesy. The music was great. The atmosphere felt like a child's park due to shouting kids, running around the restaurant. The decor felt like outdoor seating and the writing all around walls made the place feel like a high school chemistry desk because of all the writing. We arrived a few minutes before another table but was waited on after that table.  The worst aspect of the restaurant, the CHARGE for TAP WATER! The waitress was nice. Would I eat here again? Only if this was the last place for seafood. Would make a decent place for beer pong competitions.
