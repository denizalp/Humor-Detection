UPDATE: Ok I went to this place with some out-of-state visitors of mine who were staying @ the Hooters. We arrived @ Hooters @12:05 and they closed @ 12. damn.  Only other choice is Dan Marino's aka The Mad Onion. Ok, sure I've been there before and saw tons of people order those wings so I'll go with that. BAD DECISION!!! \n\nif Hooters is closed, just go home and get a great breakfast somewhere else in the AM. The wings were the worst I've ever tasted. I thought Rum Runner was the worst wings but this place gave them a run for their $ and have been crowned worst wings ever. I wish I had taken a picture but imagine Wet Republic @ MGM ... now imagine the water is grease. imagine the chairs floaties are wings and that the water is a cool 45F. coldest, greasiest wings ever. I realize the hour is late but you're an open business. You should be used to patrons asking for different things on the menu. and beign this is y oru late night special - I'd figure this is something you'd prepare to order... for this to be fresh today not fresh yesterday. \n\nI stomached literally 1.5 wings. 1st b\/c i didnt know.. 2nd 1\/2 just to make sure. even the french fries were inedible. My smart friend that ordered the egg and chicken fried steak plate had toast with her so since I really was trying to get he grease taste out of my mouth. I wouldnt go bk but instead head to a buffalo wild wings thats open 24\/7.
