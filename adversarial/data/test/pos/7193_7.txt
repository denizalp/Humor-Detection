We came back today to get the sopressata sandwich.  When we arrived, I took a look at the Market Sandwich of the day and it looked delicious so I got that instead.  Today the market sandwich was roasted pork belly, balsamic onions and some escarole.  It was freaking awesome.  The pork was juicy and fatty, the onions were on point and the escarole gave it some crunch, all the while on their amazing bread.  It was a great sandwich and I would definitely get it again.  My wife got the sopressata sandwich and this time it was a little different.  Usually it has roasted red peppers, but for whatever reason today it had some sauteed\/grilled onions.  Still tasty might I add, but the combo of roasted red peppers was better in my opinion.  My wife being the awesome person she is, gave me almost half her sandwich.  It was awesome and overall it was a great lunch.  Washed it down with a Mexican Coke and a little nutty caramel for dessert.  Tasty stuff!
