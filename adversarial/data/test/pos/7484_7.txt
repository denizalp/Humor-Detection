Tis the season to shop locally, falalalalalalala laaaaa. \n\nBut guess what, friends? Stylish stemware is always in season. BYOB is the perfect place to buy gifts for loved ones, enemies with fabulous taste, and yourself. It is a veritable who's who of all the best celebrity glass couples. I tend to buy in pairs, because one stunning cocktail glass alone looks so lonely, no matter how perfect it is. \n\nThe shop is jam-packed with crystal and other vintage drinking trinkets, so don't come in drunk. No one likes a bull in a china shop. Figuratively. Literally, I think a bull in a china shop would be an excellent youtube video. \n\nPROF PEPPER: The original champagne glasses were modeled after Marie Antoinette's breasts.
