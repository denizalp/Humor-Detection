I went to Le Studio for the first time today and got a hair cut and low lights. I must say it has to be the best haircut and color i have had so far, the stylist definitely listened to what i wanted and i got the results i wanted and some. I would recommend this Salon to anyone, i watched everyone there and they all do a really good job. I cannot wait for my next appointment :) Ask for Denise she is great!
