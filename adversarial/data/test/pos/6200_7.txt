After all the hype about Long Wong's and The Most Amazing Wings, Like, Ever, this place was a sore disappointment.  I went for happy hour as they were advertising 2-for-1 appetizers, and I'd been craving some fried shrimp, only to discover that the 2-for-1 applied only to one particular menu item.\n\nIt was early when we got there, and the place was nearly empty.  We sat at a table for about ten minutes waiting for the bartender\/waitress to take our order, but this never happened, and it certainly wasn't because we were hiding from her.  We ended up ordering our wings and drinks at the window. The fried shrimp was okay, but over cooked.   Were the wings good?  Sure.  FANTASTIC?  Not even.  The ranch was watered down to the point that it dripped off the wings and the carrot sticks were scrawny, floppy, and dry.  There's no way they had been cut any time in the last two days.\n\nThe place is decorated with crap found at Goodwill.  Not usually a bad thing, but is in this case.  There's a tiny stage in one corner, but I won't be back to see who plays it.  To top it off, a family with a gaggle of children came in before we left, and were given menus and served almost immediately.\n\nOverall?  Mediocre bar food, mediocre happy hour prices, poor service and atmosphere.  Meh.
