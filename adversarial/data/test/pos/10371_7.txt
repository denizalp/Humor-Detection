Happy Birthday to me. \n\nI came here with a group of friends for my birthday party. I was pretty stoked, since this was my first pool party experience.  The pool was ridiculously crowded and it was a pain to get in. Even as hotel guests, we got sent to 3 different lines before they let us in. It was opening day and I was expecting to see a lot of eye candy. I was not disappointed. However, I was bummed that we couldn't find a place to sit and to get a table was extremely pricey. We ended up renting a locker and chillin' in the pool. The water was warm and had a strange milky color. The girls did not get into the water in fear of STDs or getting pregnant. Overall it was an okay experience. \n \nA little about my credentials:\n\nGrowing up in Baltimore, I never learned how to swim. Combine that with my insecurity and man boobs, I can probably count the number of times I've been to the pool on one hand. I'm not a pool expert. but I do enjoy laying out once in a while.
