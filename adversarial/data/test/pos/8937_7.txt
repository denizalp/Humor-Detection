Paramount Fine Foods is one of those places I really want to love but just everything are falling short in every aspect.\n\nSince I was with a bunch of Yelpers here for a Sunday Brunch UYE, we were able to order a few dishes to share! \n\nManaakeesh Zaatar ($2.49)\n- I just love the spices and herbs\n\nHummus with Chicken ($7.99)\n- A-ok, but I am never a fan of hummus\n- Though the complimentary Puffy Pita Bread that comes with it were so good! The best part of the meal!\n\nMixed BBQ Platter ($69.99)\n- Chicken, Beef and Kafta which I found them all really bland tasting, dried and cold..\n- Though the mixed pickles on the side were delicious... \n\nThe complimentary coffee at the end which you can help yourself though is a really nice to end the meal. \n\nService is non existence, but I don't really mind since it is more like a self served restaurant.\n\nParamount has the one of the most filthy ladies washrooms I have been to! Seems like none of the staffs ever checked the washrooms for the whole day: toilet paper scattered everywhere and even puddles of pee on the floor... Maybe I went to the men's washroom by accident?
