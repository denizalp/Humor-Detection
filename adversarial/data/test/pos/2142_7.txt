Some of the best deals on liquor are to be had here. They don't have everything in stock, but the items they do carry are extremely reasonably priced. I purchased several bottles of Apothic Red at one of the lowest prices I have seen recently in the city. \n\nThe best part? You do NOT need a membership to buy your booze here! Holla!
