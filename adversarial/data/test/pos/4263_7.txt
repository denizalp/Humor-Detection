I would much rather have tried the Downtown location, but, lo, I was dating a guy from Gilbert.  That lasted 2 weeks.  The date, not the food.\nGood enough, I guess.  I had some sandwich but it wasn't very memorable.  It came out pretty quickly, even though it was 5 minutes to closing time.  I'm guessing it was microwaved.\nI'll definitely go back, just not to this location.
