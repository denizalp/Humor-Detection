I'm a starving student...well, not that starving since I'm a yelper, but when I dine out, it's usually on a budget. Lucky for me, Vegas gave me the gift of restaurant week for my birthday weekend in Vegas. It's what every girl dreams of...\n  L'Atelier was where I chose to have my birthday dinner, and what an amazing dinner it was. I opted for the special prix fixe menu for restaurant week.\n  \n - Course 1: gazpacho. Now, I'm not a huge fan of gazpacho, it's really just cold soup, right? Wrong. At L'Atelier, it's light and flavorful with great presentation.\n - Course 2: langoustine fritter with basil pesto. Great presentation and even better flavors. The wrapper was fried to a light, crispy perfection, and the langoustine was prepared simply enough to not detract from its natural flavors. The pesto was a great complement to the dish.\n - Course 3: Rib-eye with mashed potatoes. The presentation on this was so simple...literally just meat and potatoes, but wow, they were spectacularly done. It was a lesson in how simple food could be incredible--no foam, or extraneous garnishes to marr the plate or the tastes. The rib-eye was seasoned perfectly and incredibly tender. The potatoes had been whipped into submission with tons of butter and milk, but still had great texture.\n  - *Bonus* Raspberry birthday tart: one of my dear friends informed that waitstaff that it was my birthday, and they brought out a beautiful raspberry tart with 'happy birthday' written on the plate and a candle. After my friends all sang to me, the waiter whisked it away and cut it into pieces and served it to everyone. It was simple but very good.\n - Course 4: souffl√© with pistachio gelato.  It was served tableside with the gelato. It was very light, and the presence of egg whites was noticeable in the texture, but it paired very well with the gelato.\n  The price of such a dining experience? $50.09. Quite a steal if you ask me.  They have several other prix fixe menus of different prices, so even if you don't come during restaurant week, you can still have a great meal without breaking the bank. Save that for gambling.
