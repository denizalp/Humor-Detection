You can really never go wrong with Brio. Hands down the best local Happy Hour IMO! \n\nBrio has Happy Hour Mon - Fri from 3:30P - 6:30P. HH is available at the bar\/seating around the bar indoors or outside. Bartenders and servers are incredibly attentive on a consistent basis and the HH bites and drinks are so worth the visits to Brio.\n\nBelow are my go to recommendations:\n\n- Beef Carpaccio $4\nThinly sliced carpaccio topped with greens, capers, and mustard aioli. I will be honest... There has been a few times when the carpaccio has been chewier than preferred but I'm hoping those were a few one offs. The past two times I've visited, the carpaccio has been on point! \n\n- BRIO Burger $6\nNever disappoints. Comes already precut in quarters to share and the patty cooked to your liking. Also served with a side of homemade chips which are always delicious \n\n- Black Pepper Shrimp and Eggplant $6\nMy favorite!! I don't think I've met someone yet who hasn't enjoyed this dish. Saut√©ed shrimp paired with small pieces of breaded eggplant - smothered in a creamy reddish black pepper sauce with just the right amount of spicy kick to it! I can easily devour an order of this myself \n\n- Tomato Mozzarella Salad $5\nSlices of tomato and mozzarella topped with basil and greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. Balsamic drizzled on top - a very light and refreshing salad\n\nI personally indulge on their wine during Happy Hour - $5 for quality wine is quite the deal and the pours are great. Love their house Chardonnay. \n\nI've been to Brio for lunch and dinner (they have a delicious bleu cheese steak salad and a variety of tasty pastas) but I'm definitely more a promoter of their Happy Hour!
