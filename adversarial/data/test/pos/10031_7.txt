Terrible place.\n\nWent here for the 11.99$ double combo consisting of two BLT, two Super-Croque, or one of each.\n\nThey charged me 1$ extra for the BLT despite the coupon said otherwise. The manager's crappy explanation was \"if we don't charge the extra 1$ we're losing money.\" And she even gave me attitude like I shouldn't even bother to ask.\n\nSeriously? This is a franchise, not a home-owned sugar shack, where are the consistencies?\n\nIt's not about the money, it's about sending a message.\n\nGuess who's not coming back? Losing money? No s***.
