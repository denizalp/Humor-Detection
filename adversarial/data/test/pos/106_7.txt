Small gift shop featuring trinkets and candles, picture frames and optimistic phrases printed on various surfaces. \nFrankly, this seemed like a place old ladies might shop. In addition to the unorganized, oddball gift selections they also offer custom order invitations. Didn't see a particular brand they carried and they didn't appear to do them in-house by hand, but had several samples out to view.\n\nPrices are all over the place with various baskets of junk marked with clearance prices and high regular prices on items I can't imagine buying. Very bizarre selection.
