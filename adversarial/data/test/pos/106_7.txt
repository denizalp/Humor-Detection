So truthfully the food was 5\/5 amazing!!! Totally rocked!!! I am a huge michael mina fan, I have ate @ stone hill, nob hill (now closed), sea blue (closed) pub1842, American fish and I have met michael mina personally and thanked him for all the great dining experiences! So I am not a mammaluke yelper griping for no reason! I am a seasoned gastronome and formal fine dining captain of a multiple michelin star restaurants. \nSo I don't yelp a lot lately but this has to be shared...\nBy far worst service in a fine dining restaurant ever!!! \nReservation booked as a birthday, Maitre D' or manager who was super polite initially. walks us to table, we mention it's birthday he acknowledges as well. \nFIRST COURSE\nPlace food order we request that we split the  shrimp tortellini between seat # 1 and #4, and seat #2 onion soup, Captain (pathetic to give this joker that title) acknowledges \nSecond COURSE.  \nsplit mixed green salad same way seat #1 and #4. And me seat #2   will have  artichoke truffle salad. \n3rd COURSE\nLobster pot pie split between seat # 1 and #2, 2 orders lamb seat # 3 and #4 and side of beets.\nNow what went wrong?\nordered 2 ice teas never came\nShrimp tortellini and mixed green salad and onion soup delivered same time not split (Btw if the kitchen doesn't split things which is respectable we were not told) I was delivered onion soup. \nWhat happens now??? So I have to then Eat artichoke salad by myself and feel like a gluttonous pig while no one else at the table has foood and we SPECIFICALLY order in a way to avoid this!!!!\nNext the captain comes to mark our table and backhands all of us like he is working @ denny's!\nEntrees arrive and lobster pot pie split on a gueridon by the captain he deliver the plates and says \"it is very hot! I should know I just touched it\" WTF u just touched my food that is disgusting!! \nFood was great! \nOh so my water glass is empty for at least 2 minutes \nOh and the beets never arrived?\noh and we ordered dessert and there was no candle\nOH no one ever checked on any of courses???? \nOh our table was never crumbed?\nOh ya when we left there was no manager around or maitre d? To tell this too that is why I yelp which is so lame.\nIN CONCLUSION\nGreat food lobster pot pie still one of my all time faves incredible.   \nService TERRIBLE what an f'ing AHOLE of a captain screwed up every course and never checked on anything. Pathetic service not worthy of any restaurant I'm disgusted!!!!! Gross he touched our food as a joke? Sick BASTARD.!!!!! I love michael mina and all of his restaurants but your namesake place has a lot of issues with pathetic forgetful service. Please hiring new management to eliminate these clowns butchering your legacy!!!!!!
