This place stinks to high heaven of fish.  But it's a store with plenty of food at low prices, so it's worth a visit for your Asian cooking needs.  There're plenty of instant noodle choices, Korean candy\/snacks, seaweed, rice and fresh fish.  There's also a refrigerator stocked with great Asian drinks like chocolate soy milk and iced green tea.  The popsicles are my favorite, and they're always well stocked in ice cream and popsicles.  I also love that credit cards are accepted.  I've always been pleased with the service I receive at check-out here.  The aisles are a bit crowded, and they might want to consider a bigger location.
