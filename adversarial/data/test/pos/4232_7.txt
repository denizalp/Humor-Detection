Made a stop in here on a door-to-door tour of all the new spots that just opened in this mixed-use development.  It was cold and rainy out, but the owner quickly welcomed the wife and I in with a glass of wine and a personal introduction to his business.  \n\nWhile things are still settling in, there will be a small amount of seating around the front, but the real draw is the bar that swings around almost the length of the shoppe.  There is a large black board behind the bar that describes that day's wine pourings and offers specials on other wines to be found on the shelves which line the length of the back wall.  I'll get to the wine in a minute, because I can't go on any longer without talking about the chocolate truffles, found in a glass case in the center of the bar.  \n\nOn our visit, there were about 12-15 different chocolate truffles, dark and milk chocolate, covering all kinds of wonderful ganache centers- I was especially fond of the blood orange and caramel with sea salt.  They are all made-house.  I will be back to try the coffees, the teas, and the pure Peruvian dark chocolates.  If you're lucky, there might be a few samples on top of the bar.   Try at your own risk, 'cause then you'll want more!  Purchases come in nicely designed clear little boxes and are handled with a white glove- talk about respecting the chocolate!  Each truffle has it's own delicate design and you can mix and match as you like.  Hey fellas- drop the mass-made Godiva and impress your lady friend with a box of these- they'll step up your game!\n\nNow for the wine.  If you've seen my other reviews, you know I'm pretty much into wines- especially Spanish and California reds.  Well, Petit Phillippe's name is most ironic because their wine selections are monstrously bold and good.  Small production wineries can be found among a few larger, but well-chosen, producers.  What is apparent is the thought and effort that went into selecting their offerings.  A good few varietals are present- pinot, merlot, cab, grenache, etc. But each wine they sell is there with a purpose- nothing just to try and move a bottle out the door.  The owner and his staff are knowledgable and can steer you towards whatever your occasion or palette best calls for for.\n\nOn our visit, the wine pouring was limited to about six bottles that appeared to be served and priced as a flight.  I think it was Oregon vs. California pinot noirs.  Interesting.  Had it not been lunch time, I'd have bought in.  I think this will change weekly, if not more often, so here's another e-mail list to get yourself onto to find some new and good stuff.\n\nThey are also working on a reserve room for still more, high-end wines.  On our visit, this was unfinished and it seems the contractor and the subs were fighting over who was at fault.  We were assured this would get finished, and I don't doubt it because they need the shelf space!\n\nI'm excited to have found Petit Phillippe and think it's got a good thing going- smart wine and gourmet chocolate.  Definitely a stop for date night or just about anytime you want to treat yourself.
