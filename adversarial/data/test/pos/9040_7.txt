Wonderful and friendly staff! They are so welcoming and make you feel very comfortable from the moment you walk in the door. I've had both Dr. Zeisler and Dr. Jenkins and really liked them both. This last time I went I found out Dr. Jenkins was volunteering his time to do dental work on those who don't have access in other countries. I thought that was very honorable. Overall, a very nice facility!
