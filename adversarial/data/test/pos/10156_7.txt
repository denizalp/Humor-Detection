When we first walked in we were so turned off by the rancid smell. We really were thinking on dashing for the door, but we gave the place benefit of the doubt because the night was already getting late.\n\nJade was our waitress, and it was fine as she took our orders, then all hell broke loose. Not 1, but 2 instances caused us all to pay for our drinks, pick up and go.\n\nJade was taking our orders and I was the start. I wanted some Miso Udon, and also wanted to order a roll as an appetizer to share. As soon as I said I wanted the extra roll, she asked me \"are you hungry?\" topped off with some sarcasm. Thanks for the shaming Jade, real classy. I decided to tell her I didn't want the roll and she proceeded in defense to say that the bowls of Udon were big when she heard my offended tone. I said no again and again  after she continued to ask me if I was sure and that I was able to togo the roll if I don't finish. Why even say anything the first place to change my mind when in the end she's trying to persuade me to get the dang roll?\n\nMy friend Simon wanted ramen and ordered his dish, and she asked him what kind he wanted. He didn't know that he could pick his protein and simply asked \"what kinds are there?\" Instead of responding she kept on pointing at the menu and making him look for the small print, he was looking for it and she finally figured out if would be faster just to explain to him... \n\nUnfortunately, we didn't even get to try the food, we felt so unwelcome, offended, and uncomfortable we had to cancel our orders and walk out. $8 dollars and change, for 2 waters, 2 teas and a sprite, that's quite high. \n\nI really don't find myself coming back to try the food unfortunately. I enjoy places that participate in making the client experience a good one.\n\nOriginally I gave Sushi Plus a 1 star. I decided to up my review to 2 stars because a waitress, Eunice, reached out and apologized. I felt that some effort and customer service was in place, so I decided on giving them another star.
