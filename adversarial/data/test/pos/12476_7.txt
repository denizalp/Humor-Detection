Heard about this place from my husbands mechanic, let me say this place was amazing. Ample seating,  serves liquor. My husband had the stuffed chicken sopapilla, I had the pork verde burrito smothered in green sauce.  OMG flavor was amazing,  every bite kept getting better.  For $3 more you can have a side of rice,  beans,  salad, or pozole there was an additional cost for pork pozole for. 65 on top on the $3 let me tell you I will never step foot in La Bonita again to get my pozole, flavor was incredible. It also comes with a sopapilla on the side,  we couldn't even finish the food we took it home. The staff was very friendly. I wanted to kiss the cook for doing a amazing job.  We will definitely be back and spread the word of  this amazing restaurant!!
