My french fry barometer registered a \"what the what?\"  I know I sound a little pissy, but there is no excuse for lukewarm fried food ever, especially at noon in a food court. Jeez, I get a gift certificate every year from one of my many jobs and while I appreciate the gesture, I think I would appreciate some proper fried food more. Cold onion rings....... you know my panties were in a wad.
