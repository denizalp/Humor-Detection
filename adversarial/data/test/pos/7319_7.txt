\"Bare\" Pool Lounge....we should have known this was a topless day club just from the name, lol.\n\nMe and my girls were looking for a place to chill on a couple drinks and snacks before our flight and these two employees at a nearby froyo shop suggested Bare Pool Lounge-- they also gave us each a couple complimentary drink tickets-- so why not? \n\nLocated at the Mirage, we walked down a relatively long, narrow, garden pathway to the entrance of the pool.  We still had no idea that this may be an \"adult \" pool lounge bahaha..  This pool lounge is smaller than Marquee\/EBC\/Wet Republic, but it was pretty decent.  There is one bar, one main pool in the center, and small tubs located in the back near the DJ.\n\nThere was no line (this was on a Monday) and we were able to order our drinks without waiting either.  The bar area isn't too big and there isn't much seating unless you have a reserved table\/cabana.  We were lucky enough to grab one of the two side bar tables to chill and snack.
