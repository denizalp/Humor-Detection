The BF took me here for dinner to challenge my notions of good sushi and expand my sashimi horizons.  I'm 150% glad he did!\n\nExcellent across the board; food, service, ambiance and cleanliness.  OK, the ambiance is about as good as it's gonna get in a strip mall next to a Fry's Marketplace, but hey -- this is Phoenix. This is where we've chosen to live.  They have 2 dining rooms, a full sushi bar and I believe some grill tables in the other room.\n\nThe service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They sat us immediately on a crowded Friday night at peak dinner hour. Drink orders were taken \"tout de suite\" and served a nanosecond later.  Delicious cucumber salad for starters came out in a blink of an eye: fresh, cooling and delicious. And then began the parade of rolls; Philly, Chimichanga, Bagel, Viva La Vegas and an order of Monkey Brains (stuffed mushrooms that were off the hook...umm...err....cranium, as it were).  We scarfed.  It was all fan-fishing-tastic!\n\nAll of the food was freshly made, tasty and super satisfying.\n\nThe servers stopped back by to check in and make sure everything was OK, refilled our drinks but didn't linger or interrupt our conversation or try to be our new BFFs.\n\nI dunno what it is about good sushi but when you have it, you know it and it leaves you with a near sexual afterglow.  I had a full-body fish-gasm that lasted for hours.  Yes.  It's THAT good.  \n\nWe ate like kings for about $60 (we did order a LOT of food that night) but it was worth every penny and I would go back here again in a heartbeat!
