Seriously, Greenland, SERIOUSLY! This has by far kicked the sh!t out of any Asian grocery market in the Las Vegas Valley and surrounding cities. The cleanest supermarket as far as Asian ones go. And we all know how it usually is (example: 99 Ranch). They have a whole food court to the right as you walk in, and a bakery on the left. It is still a fairly new complex so a lot of the \"office space\" hasn't been occupied yet! I am excited to see what else comes in. \n\nAnywhoooooo, I could have sworn I went here at least 3 times in the week that I first found out about this place!! What makes this place even better is the fact that they have cute Korean ladies making samples of the different food every single time I go! They've got some personality and are very funny too! (\"You don't need to read what it is! Just try it!\" or \"Hungry time! Come on!\") \n\nNow the banchan has got to be some of the best selection! I LOVE THE ROASTED FISHCAKE! AHHH, and the bean sprouts! and the pickled daikon! and the different selections of kimchi! Even ready to take kimbap! WOW... just WOW! The pre-packaged bulgogi is YUMMY! And, if you get the bulgogi in the case, they weigh the meat first, price that, and then ask if you want more sauce! SCORE! I frequent this section of the store the most! Not to mention i just love  the non-stop yummy smells coming from behind the banchan display. \n\nThey even have other things besides food, like teapots, plates, fans... a bunch of random home goods and personal care items on the left side of the store. I thought about the hair dye... haha, but that will need to come with a translator! I did buy a cute little teapot for under $10 though. \n\nI'm also happy that the people at the check-out counter are friendly! And the prices are very reasonable too! Especially for a lot of the snacks!\n\nEven though it's a little further down the way for me, I'd still make the drive to this place! PLUS, they're open until midnight! YAY.
