What a great experience!!  While producing a conference in Phoenix, I wanted to take the staff out for a great time at a restaurant and with food that we can't get in Detroit.  In my research, I found Barrio Caf√©, and so glad I did.  I called ahead days before and were told THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS.  And they are NOT kidding about that, so be prepared to wait. It's a small, yet very popular place, but worth the wait.  While we were waiting, we ordered chips, salsa, and guacamole.  All three were great, but the guacamole with pomegranate seeds was phenomenal!  Living 3\/4 of the way across the country, I am definitely going to try to recreate it at home.\n\nOnce we got our table (there were 7 of us and we had to wait for 2 side by side tables to clear out), our service was friendly and efficient.  They served fresh white bread with an olive tapenade.  Several of us had read up on Chef Silvana, and were excited to try her creations.  I ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  Reminiscent of my family's North Carolina Appalachian pulled pork, it had a Mexican flare that was unique and delicious.  It was even served with a thin \"dip\" rather than a thick bbq style sauce.  Outstanding.  Another of our crew ordered the Chiles en Nogada and we traded bites.  It was also outstanding. Fruity and flavorful. \n\nAfter dinner, we took a group photo in front of the artwork on the side of the building.  I will definitely go back if I have the opportunity.  Thanks for a great experience.
