Dear Mr. Wynn,\n\nThank you for taking the opportunity to create one of the best club atmospheres I have ever experienced in my life. I was surrounded by gorgeous booty all night. Very spacious and relaxing. The center stage, the pool, the bars - all very thought out and classy, but not pretentious like Pure@Caesars. It was in the middle of Tiesto's new song called - Club Life in Vegas Volume 24 Track 9 Beat 7 Remix 99 - when I realized that this was the best night I have ever had in Vegas.\n\nRegards
