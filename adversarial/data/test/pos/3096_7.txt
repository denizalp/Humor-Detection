Stayed here the other night as it was the cheapest in the GTA right next to the airport and 20 minutes away from Downtown. \n\nStreet parking is free, and saves $15\/night.\n\nRoom was quiet and comfortable, despite being next to the airport and having a window-based air conditioner that was controlled by a wall unit.\n\nBathroom was in great shape with fantastic water pressure, curved shower curtain, and amenities including mouthwash, shower gel along with the standard soap and shampoos!\n\nSelection of TV channels were great and included US and HD TV channels!\n\nComplimentary WiFi was sufficient and the black out curtains made sleeping through the night a breeze!\n\nComplimentary breakfast was available for those that are less picky with food and are ok with frozen sausage patties, waffles etc.\n\nStaff was friendly and in uniform too!
