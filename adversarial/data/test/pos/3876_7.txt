Not my favorite spot in town for AYCE Sushi...but the one I frequent the most due to the combination of service, quality, and AVAILABILITY! Umiya has been consistent across several visits the last couple years, so when the topic of AYCE Sushi comes up these days, it tends to be our go-to option. My love and I are fans of nigiri, while our girls also like to mix it up with rolls. Umiya serves a good enough quality of fish with their nigiri that the adults are content, while the huge selection of rolls means everyone is pleased. And while sushi is our mainstay, we will venture into other types of food. There are certainly enough options that a non-sushi eater **pausing to sigh and shed a tear at the sad plight that some endure** could easily fill up on noodles, skewers, tempura, katsu, etc. without straining for options.\n\nYou don't tend to go to AYCE Sushi for the ambiance and Umiya doesn't really buck the trend. It's not that Umiya is bad by any means...mostly a large open dining room full of several long tables with bench seating...and as such things can get loud during their dinner rush. That being said, the tables are large enough that you have your own space. \n\nI love that you can call ahead for reservations. Umiya goes on a wait wist during peak dinning options, but when we've made reservations...or even just called ahead 30-45 mins before we arrived, a table has been ready for us. This could just be our luck, but after more than a handful of visits here the last couple of years, I'd like to believe that it's the norm.\n\nAs a nigiri eater, the most import thing I can leave you with is a note on the specials board. There are a couple of wax marker boards hanging in the dinning room, and another at the sushi bar itself, that list some special that are in that day. These typically include some premium items that have a limit on how many you can order, and my favorite items of the night are typically listed here...such as salmon belly and madai. Make a point to check it out!\n\nAYCE Sushi is a category all to itself. I'm a fan of Umiya. For me they are a very strong 3 stars or a weak 4 stars, but I have to lean to 4 stars.
