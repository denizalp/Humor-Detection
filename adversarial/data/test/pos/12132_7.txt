I did not book a room here, but did spend most of my time here during this trip to Vegas. Why? Well the cousins were all staying here. \n\nI had the opportunity to check out their suite BUT not without a room key as there is tightened security and you are not able to get to the elevators without one unless your with someone who owns a room key. I guess this is a good thing, you dont want to WIN BIG then try to go up to your room with someone following you, then robbing you! You also dont want anyone stalking you either! \n\nThe room was marvelous. 2 queen sized beds, a huge comfortable sofa, 2 big LCD tvs, a walk in bathroom with a separate restroom for the toilet. Damn I gave all this up to stay at The Rio because I could not stand rooming with my cousins? At least I get peace and quiet with my own room. \n\nHave you ever checked out floor 10 at The Venetian? Bouchon is located on the 10th floor at the Venetian! So is the 24 hr front desk for any of your VIP status needs! I swear it looks like a museum with all the art on top of the ceiling and just the way this whole place is structured. Picasso would have been proud. \n\nThe casino was no luck for me as I ended up losing some money, but it was all fun and games. Lots of great restaurants at The Venetian such as Delmonicos Steakhouse, The Grand Lux, the list goes on! You can walk through Restaurant Row and get to The Palazzo if you want to jump casinos. \n\nOh yea, something about Marc Jacobs items for 10 bucks here? I think it was a scarf or small purse, or something to that nature. The gf and friends were all raving about it and could not get enough. Shop till you drop!
