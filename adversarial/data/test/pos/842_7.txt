Nala and I are very lucky to find Marc! He does a great job with my very active Golden Retriever. I will definitely recommend high 5 to everybody. You can feel the trust once you meet him. Nala has very hard time trusting new people, but since the very first time we meet Marc she was just fine.\n\nWhen I come home after work she is always so much happier the days when Marc walks and play with her, since my job is very consuming she just to spend more than 8 hours at day by her self. We are really happy with the service, some times he pick her from my doggie care and bring her home and feed her. \n\nThanks for make my Nala's life much better with all that love and happy walks...
