Well, I never thought I would have to USE The Rocket, but alas, here I was!  I was scouring the internet looking for places to get t-shirts made.  Thought I would go the promotional\/marketing route but that was like a minimum 250 unit order, so that wouldn't work.  Then someone reminded me about THE ROCKET!  You know The Rocket?? Located on 17th Avenue and Kensington but you can never REALLY think of anything you want at the time?  Well this time I had a use.\nThey carry a lot of American Apparel items which is great because they carry them for cheaper than what AA sells them for.  I got 6 shirts completed with two different designs.  I left my new couture babies in the hands of the very nice, very capable, SAM!  Sam is awesome because I literally wrote it all out for her... walked away worried, and she nailed it! Totally nailed all of them.. And they look GREAT!  We are so pleased with how they turned out.  I will definitely be coming back to the rocket for more gear!  Maybe even a customized trucker hat.  Maybe not.  I'm too old to wear anything cool anymore...*cries into iphone 4*
