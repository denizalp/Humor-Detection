There's an incredible few times I willingly make a butt out of myself in public, but this lounge has somehow managed to coax me into it :-p\n\nI visited twice in one night, once earlier when there were very few people there, and an hour or so later when it was packed and I was far too smashed to sing (I bet you can tell where this is going lol).\n\nSo. I'd never been to a lounge with a live pianist who could play practically anything... let alone a place you could sing with said pianist on open mic nights. It's like karaoke with your own live band!\n\nThe place was cute. The pianist was upbeat and funny. The bartender was sweet and the patrons all seemed like cool cats. There was no way I was going to leave this place never to come back (I don't live in NV) WITHOUT getting up there to sing something.\n\nEnter the shyness problem: I only had a drink and a half upon my first visit. Definitely not enough to get up and sing. Big mistake was waiting til after I had visited three other bars and finished my 7th drink of the night. I came back to Don't Tell Mama just... smashed.\n\nI was coherent enough to walk upright, pull money out of my wallet and fill out a request slip. Whether I was coherent enough to sing is completely unbeknownst to me. I was at a point where I couldn't hear myself at all... \n\nEither way, people seemed to be good sports about it. I know I flubbed quite a few of the words but honestly barely remember singing anything lol. I am so sorry to the staff and pianist for dealing with what I'm sure was a train wreck :-p And thank you for being so nice when introducing me and exiting me.\n\nAll in all I had a great time. I immediately left and ran back to my hotel room making it just in time for the new year countdown. I don't know how I managed to not get hit by a car and how I avoided the crazy people in my drunk was but I'll definitely never forget that night
