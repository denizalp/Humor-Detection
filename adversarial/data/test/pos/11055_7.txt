I travel a lot for business and I stay exclusively at the Marriott properties.  This one really just wasn't all that great of an experience.\n\nFirst impression  of the place is that its in a not-so-great neighborhood and the way the road is laid out if you miss the turn in you have to go around and try again.\n\nMy company called ahead and made reservations with their credit card on file for payment, the lady at the desk was nice and to the point and thanked me for waiting and during the check in she asked for a credit card for incidentals which is typical and fine. \n\nI got my key and headed up to the room to drop off luggage and then head back down, immediately outside the front door I was propositioned by someone asking if I wanted a \"date\"  I declined, but I knew what was up. \n\nAfter returning with dinner I got comfortable and hopped int he shower, I'm 6'6\" tall and my head was literally 3 inches from the ceiling in the shower, its an odd feeling some people may never experience. Overall the room was clean organized and typical, just had a dated and worn feeling. \n\nIn the morning I packed up and headed down to get breakfast which is supposed to be served between 6:30 and 8 or so, unfortunately I guess the person who normally sets it up was not there so breakfast was not ready,  The manager was trying to get things together and was running around trying  to make it happen.\n\nFor anyone that stays at these hotels they give you a receipt under your door sometime during the night and I noticed that my credit card was charged for the full amount.  Since the manager was running around and I had to be out the door I didnt even bother trying to get this sorted out \n\nI'd suggest you stay at a different location if you have the option.
