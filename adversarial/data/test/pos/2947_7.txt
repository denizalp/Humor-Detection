2.8 Stars (it's my Yelp and I'll 2.8 if I want to). \nIf you want inspiration on good lighting, this is your place. We hip hip hippity hopped to this hipster haven (how's that for alliteration?). \n\nVIBE\nSimple but effective decor. You've got the mason jar lighting and the starred lighting in the front window. I love the stars along the wall. I also love the little alcove near the front window and the bar. Who ever gets to sit at the bar at a brekkie joint? The guys here are really nice and service effective and on its game. It does feel like you're going to a friend's place for a good breakfast and a hang out. Oh, and there's a cool little poker room in the back that has a round table that seats about 8 people. The flower paintings look like they were hand picked from the Salvation Army but that's the appeal. \n\nWE ATE \nFirstly, big up props on the tangerine juice. Mmmm. Better than Kool Aid. OH YEAH. \n\nWe had the Ploughman's lunch, rosti and Federal Benny (their version of egg's benny). I felt the food missed the mark. On the ploughman's was the rabbit terrine (not something you have everyday) and though it was nice, it's not something I used to and wasn't hearty enough. I didn't eat the pickled jelly or the cauliflower pickled stuff. Oh, and there's more pickles --dill and I asked for extra dill, which they very nicely gave. There was supposed to be blue cheese and there wasn't (I didn't need to know!) but then they found some and gave me white cheddar on top of it. The bread they get locally sourced across the street (and from Joe's for their sandwiches) was delicious. And yes, the rosti is yum. I would suggest sour cream to go with it (that's my Movenpick tendencies kicking in). \n\nI had a taste of the Federal Benny and dining companion wasn't impressed. It's not that it lacked flavour --it was just off in terms of taste. I'm a hollandaise gal and to not have hollandaise on a classic is a no no for me. I can't describe this. (Which is how much I love hollandaise). \n\nThis was my first time here but I'd come back and see if the sandwiches would change my mind because they looked pretty tasty. The Cobb salad also looked tasty (albeit deconstructed). \n\n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nI like that this place is motivating people to get down to the Dufferin\/Dundas area and love the gentrification happening here but the food has to be good and it was meh. I think this would be a cool place to have a dance party though (with tangerine juice).
