Celebrating my dads birthday tonight. Of course, like at any respectable restaurant we were expecting a celebratory birthday dessert...unfortunately, this photo is not an \"after\" photo. Cake? Ice cream? Nope, just an inedible meringue with a chocolate drizzle happy birthday? Shocking. Next year, Benihana.
