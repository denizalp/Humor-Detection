I went here with a buddy yesterday,  We walked in and both immediately thought...this place is shady!  People were walking around....staring down a hallway...waiting by the register.  Once I got in the room, I was told to remove my shirt and shoes\/socks. I didn't want to remove my pants as I didn't know what to expect.  The massage was advertised as a foot spa and it was certainly much more than that.  I would definitely go back again the next time I'm in Vegas.
