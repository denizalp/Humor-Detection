I was somewhat excited to try this place. Then I saw the menu as I was walking in. It looked revolting. I don't want to know that the fries are done in 100% lard and that the milkshakes are made with pure butter fat. The beer selection was less than mediocre. The ambiance wasn't great. \n\nThen I told them I didn't want to wear the nasty smock-thing they want to put on you, and they told me I had to. So I walked out. I'm guessing I saved myself several days worth of calories for not much taste. I ended up at Chicago Brewing Company at 4 Queens, which, while it's not as good as the original in Summerlin, still kicks the shit out of the Heart Attack place.\n\nAnd really? You eat for free if you're over 350 pounds? That should be illegal.
