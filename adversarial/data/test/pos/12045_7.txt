This is not a fancy restaurant it's a good old fashioned no frills BBQ chicken joint ! I pass by it all the time and the location itself always looks clean and well maintained. However, on my end I've only ever had delivery as opposed to eating there in person. While I did notice that even though they are closeby the delivery time tends to be longer than that of other restaurants but still within reason. That being said they always get the order right and the chicken is always juicy\/tasty and well prepared! I usually order their club sandwich which comes with a great pickle, a generous serving of perfectly cooked\/salted fries and really good cole slaw. The other nice thing is they include a serving of gravy on the side which is the cherry on the Sunday because who doesn't love gravy ?? I've also tried their hot chicken sandwich which smartly provides gravy and peas on the side to pour them yourself to make sure the dish doesn't get too soggy during delivery. I was also pleasantly surprised when I tried one of their desserts (apple pie cheesecake) , it was sooooo soooo good ! One last point worth mentioning is pricing -the prices are very good especially considering the generous portions and yummy food ! I will definitely eat from here again , cote saint luc BBQ chicken poutine .... I'm coming for you next ! Lol
