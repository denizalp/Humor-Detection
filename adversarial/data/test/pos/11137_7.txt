Decided to stop here for breakfast about 1pm on Saturday. Place was fairly busy, but easy for a single like me to get seated. Menu looked like it had some interesting fair and some variety on old favorites. I decided to go with a Waffle Benedict for $9.99. $2.75 for an ice tea is a bit high, all the drinks were priced in this range. No offer for refill while I ate. \n\nService was quick, and my meal was served inside 10 minutes of ordering. Crispy hash browns were cooked to my liking. The hollandaise sauce didn't have much to it, no taste of lemon or anything. Pretty bland. I ended up squeezing left over lemon from my ice tea on it to get a little bit of taste. The waffle was good, the eggs poached right and the canadian bacon a little small. Nothing that would make me want to come back for but I will try another meal here of something different.
