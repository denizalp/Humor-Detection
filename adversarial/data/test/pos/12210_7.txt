I called for an appointment as soon as I rolled into the city. There was a 3 o'clock opening. I took it. That gave me just enough time to stop by Manan Bakery right across Flamingo for a piece of cake and a cup of coffee before my massage.  \n\nI have been a customer here since like 2008. I've been to a lot of other places in Spring Valley and around town, but I haven't found any that match the massage here.  \n\nSuper happy to see it so busy when I visited this afternoon. The staff here is top notch, and sometimes you have to wait for an opening.  I recommend  phoning ahead and scheduling an appointment. \n\nI always request an appointment with Rex. If you want the very best massage in Las Vegas, I recommend you do the same.  \n\nMikey C says: I'll be in Vegas five days. I'll be here three. THAT'S what I'm talkin' 'bout.
