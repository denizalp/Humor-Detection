I've never been to this Harris Teeter and not found what I'm looking for. Today it was dessert. I ended up getting a \"Mega Cupcake\" - a tasty vanilla cupcake with cream cheese frosting swirled so high it might as well be Marge Simpson's hair. \nThe actual cupCAKE is great - the cream cheese frosting is tasty, but sitting in my bowl is about 3 inches of frosting I can't even look at. \n\nOk, maybe I'm reviewing my choice of dessert and not really Harris Teeter, after all. \n\nCase in point: This HT location is great, skip the Mega Cupcake.
