Happy hour until 8pm! How cool is that? There's a huge selection of wine and beer for $3-7, and I can tell you from my experience that the wine pours are generous. The servers are very friendly, and I like the trivia and board games floating around.\n\nThe big problem with Whining Pig though is the design. Besides the seats around the bar, there's only one table near the back. The remainder of the seating is against the wall, and who wants to be stuck staring at the wall. Even at the bar, it's difficult to play a game with more than two people in your party since you're not facing each other. I wish there were more high tops like the Arcadia location.\n\nBut again, happy hour until 8pm.
