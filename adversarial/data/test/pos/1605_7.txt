I absolutely adore sushi.  And no, I'm not snooty about my sushi.  I like nigiri along with sushi rolls.  If that makes me any less legit, so be it.  I love any roll with shrimp tempura and unagi sauce on it.  \n\nAnyway, my friend told me about this place and it's an all you can eat (AYCE) sushi place.  (I only clarify AYCE because when I was reading reviews it took me a good half hour to figure out what it meant) So the bf and I went to get our sushi on and we were not disappointed.\n\nYou have an hour to eat all the sushi you can and trust me, it's enough.  We were seated at the sushi bar, always a good place to be, and we gave our orders directly to the head sushi chef. You can order any nigiri, rolls, they have specials on the walls, as well as anything from chicken teriyaki to shrimp tempura on their side menu.  I didn't wanna waste any time on anything but the sushi though.\n\nOne of the things I LOVE is that you can order half rolls, which was great because that way you can try more things without getting ridiculously full.  So my boyfriend and I dove in ordering some toro, sweet shrimp, yellowtail, and albacore.  It was all good.  I know you worry that all you can eat = poor quality, but that is not the case here.  They have great cuts of fish along with yummy rice.  Then we started experimenting with the rolls.  \n\nI ate to the point where I almost needed to throw up.  I considered going to the bathroom and throwing up just so I could eat more. Then I resolved not to be bulimic and came back to the bar where my boyfriend was a trooper and managed to order dessert.  \n\nI have to say, if I had only 1 meal in Vegas, I would spend it here.  I wish they had a sushi mon in LA, I'd probably get mercury poisoning from going everyday.
