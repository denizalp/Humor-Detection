Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.\nWhere to begin....\n\n1.  Room-temperature beer\n2.  Apathetic manager who did not want to hear my group's complaints about room-termperature beer\n3.  The WORST guacamole I have ever put in my mouth, hands-down\n4.  Otherwise mediocre food.  Nothing whatsoever stood out as good.\n5.  It's at the Epicentre, which just sucks anyway.\n\nI will never make the mistake of returning to this abortion of a restaurant again.
