I went to the wrong Eiffel Tower this weekend. I also visited the wrong NYC, Monte Carlo, and Sahara. Sigh. That's not all that went wrong. Did you watch Hangover? Yeah, that was my weekend. \n\nTrannies, the roulette table, TELEMUNDO reality show, Larry Hernandez, fight at the concert, DJ LEE, crowd surfing for beers, Ddosing, the boys at Defcon, pawn shop rings, rich m&l beer guy, palm readers, hunting and hackers. What have I done? \n\nWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas? Tell that to my new husband. I'm now looking for a good divorce lawyer if anyone knows one. And if anyone bumps into that tranny, tell her I know she stole my bikini.
