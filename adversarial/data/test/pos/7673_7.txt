Being a second generation Italian-American, I'm uniquely qualified to do very little save for cooking and laying around in my underwear \/ beater all weekend.\nThat's what us Italians do.\nWell, that's not all we do.\n\nWe shoot people, launder money, and violate the RICO act in about a hundred different ways.\nBut wait, that's not all.\nWe eat.\nAnd we eat, and eat and eat.\nEven when we're not eating, we're planning our next meal. \nAnd sometimes, when we get sick of cooking and eating we go out to eat.\nAnd where do we go?\n\nWe only go to small, non-chain Italian restaurants.\nWhy?\nBecause there's usually some guy in the kitchen fresh off the boats who cooks Italian better than God himself. \nAnd that's why I come here.\nFor a real taste of Italy, and not the culinary slop from some chain whose kitchen staff is about to get busted by Sheriff Joe.\n\nThe veal saltimbocca, wedding soup, and pasta e fagiolo, combined with their bread, chianti and olives will make you feel like you're at your aunt's house for Sunday supper. The only thing missing is your aunt and her hairy upper-lip.\n\nNow, mangia.\nAnd remember, watch what you say.\nThe Feds are listening in.
