Now this is novelty idea, a \"Secret\" pizza place known only by word of mouth. This is a pizza restaurant located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan. You can easily pass this by since there is no sign or advertising on the directory but if you pay close enough attention to people sitting down and eating pizza nearby then you will know that this \"secret\" pizza is not as secret as you'd thought it would have been. \n\nThere is no sit down seating here, only standing room since the restaurant is very small. I guess since its open till 5am on most days that it is a perfect place to grab some cheap drunk food when everything is else is closed. Thankfully the queue moves smoothly and quickly as they have premade pizzas already and simply just heat back up in the oven. \n\nStaff is friendly and efficient. As for the pizza itself, it is pretty decent. Large slices priced around $5-6. I'd imagine if you were starving in the middle of the night then this pizza would taste fantastic but as a regular meal I would prefer pizza somewhere else such ad Grimaldis. \n\n3.5 stars
