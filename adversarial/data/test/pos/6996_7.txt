BF and I got a pretty great deal on HOTWIRE for this Hotel.  He had previously heard good things from a close friend who also scored this same deal a few weeks before.\n\nBefore our FINAL PURCHASE I consulted with trusty fellow YELPERS to get the REAL low down scoop. \n\nI definitely CONCUR this place is pretty bomb.  It was a LOT busier than we expected and when we first arrived the line to check in kind of gave me a nervous stomach.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it moved and how kind the staff was.  They were SO accommodating. We arrived there early (before noon) and were crossing our fingers that they'd let us check in early.  They were unable to get us our room right away but gave us complimentary spa passes so we could get ready and freshen up for our day of debauchery awaiting us at Encore Beach Club. \n\nThe Spa was LOVELY.  They gave us flip flops, our own lockers, and a PLUSH robe. It's everything a spa is supposed to be, serene, clean, calm and fresh.  There are private dressing rooms fully stocked with high end hair spray (alterna) hair ties, combs, brushes, curling irons, blow dryer, etc.  And there are public vanities as well.  I was unable to get into the hot tubs and pools, however I can imagine they were WONDERFUL because everything else was.  The showers were rain down showers and all of the products smelled amazing. \n\nOur room was quite nice.  It had a kitchen with two stove top burners, a microwave, a fridge and a toaster.  We were disappointed that we didn't pack some ego waffles and hot pockets for the late night munchies. :) The king size bed was LOVELY and we also had a sofabed that turned into a queen.  \n\nThe bathroom was great.  There was a large tub, this excited us immensely as my 6'4\" boyfriend doesn't fit well in typical tubs so a bath is ALWAYS out of the question.  This tub was HUGE and it was a spa tub with 3 different settings.  It was SO relaxing.  The shower was HUGE (fit 2 VERY well) too and the actual toilet area was separate from both, such a nice touch!\n\nThey had excellent service, they feature an express room service 24 hours a day.  Everything comes within 15minutes of ordering.  It's pricey but ALL room service is.  \n\nPlace is nice but I can say that we WON'T Continue going because Trump is an idiot.
