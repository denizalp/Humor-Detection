I went to this tailor because of the close proxmity to where I live. This experience was not good for two reasons. First is because the work ended up coming undone within about month. The second is because the tailor (Helen) felt it her duty to tell me that I needed to lose weight. Now granted.. that is true (me needing to lose weight) but I didn't need to hear it from this lady who I was paying to alter my clothing. Needless to say I haven't been back and won't be.  I guess if you'd like image feedback and don't mind paying for stuff that falls apart, this is the tailor for you.
