Yikes. Just, yikes.  \n\nI visited the Mia Bella \"Salon & Spa\" (they use the term loosely) with some girlfriends on our recent trip to Vegas.  Luckily I had the groupon so I didn't have to pay full price.  \n\nIf you're after a budget experience, then this may just be the right place for you!  Atmosphere left much to be desired and the professionalism of the staff was completely lacking.  Not to mention that we had to wait 45 minutes for our facial because the technitian was late (she also answered her cell phone in the middle of the treatment).  \n\nI added the second of two stars because the actual massage was quite nice.  I just had to try real hard to imagine myself in a real spa (you know, with a waiting room, and smiling friendly hosts, and you know, maybe some cucumber water if they're feeling fancy) and pray to sweet Jesus that the sheets were clean.
