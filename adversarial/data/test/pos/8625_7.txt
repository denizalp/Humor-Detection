Went here last night for a coworkers going away shindig.  The place was cool.  We had a large table outside on the patio and our waitress was on top of everything.  Blue Moons were $4.00 during Happy Hour and they had food deals too.  The people next to me got fish and chips and coconut fried shrimp (you order them individually...$1.29 each...they were big) and seemed to enjoy them.  This place has a grip of TVs but most of them are live link horse racing tracks.  Padres is an off site betting place with kiosks where you can wager on horse racing.  Interesting mix of folks...old timers with their racing programs to younger 20 somethings hanging out.  It was a chill spot and I could see myself coming back for a beer after work with the gang.
