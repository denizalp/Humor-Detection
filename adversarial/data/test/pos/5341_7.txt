Great airport with plenty to do however the staff is horrible. Downright rude and obnoxious. That's right I'm talking to you, lady at the American Airlines terminal, gate B11 who condescendingly calls you 'darlin' while telling you that your bag is not going to work. Guess what 'precious', it worked last week and the week before... it's going to work today. I know my packing limitations so stop with the power plays. \n\nSecurity is also a nightmare. Again people just sitting around waiting for the weather to cool down, not paying attention to a thing. \n\nI fly into Sky all the time and unfortunately, I'm just going to have to deal with it but come on; be a bit friendlier and pay attention.
