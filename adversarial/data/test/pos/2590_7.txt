Back in college many moons ago, I traveled around France for a few weeks during a summer break. I'm not a fan of French food, so the entire time I was there I pretty much subsisted on pain au chocolates, croissants, baguettes, and macarons.\n\nLet me tell you, the pastries you can get at Jean Marc's are just as good as the ones I ate in France. Actually, these pastries are BETTER, because you don't have to hop on a plane to get them! The croissants are buttery and flaky, with just that right amount of chewy bounce when you bite into them. The danishes are equally flaky with a perfect amount of filling. And the macarons -- ohhh, they are dessert bliss, with a wonderfully sweet, crispy shell and soft center.  I've never had a treat here that I didn't love -- the kouign amanns, the sacristans, the tarts -- it's just all SO GOOD.\n\nIn addition to loving the pastries here, I love the humble storefront and the fact that it's in a less trendy neighborhood (for the record, I think Millvale is adorable!). I always feel like I'm visiting a hidden gem when I go here, even though I know that the secret about this place has definitely been out for a long time! The whole vibe of this shop is just so rustic and quaint and wonderful. Pittsburgh is very lucky to have Jean Marc's!\n\nI'm just glad that I don't live within walking distance of this place, or I would have a serious problem.
