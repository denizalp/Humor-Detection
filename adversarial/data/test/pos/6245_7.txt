\"Annoyed\".  \n\nI never, ever want to feel annoyed when ordering.  Tea Shop 168 annoyed the hell out of me.\n\nFirst they rushed me -- I get it, I am not intimately familiar with your drink menu (or bubble tea in general), and that you're eager to serve... wait.  There's nobody else there except my friend and me.  Why are you rushing me???\n\nThen, when my pal Cassi decides \"hey, let's sit down rather than take it to go\", the girl tells me to go sit down to order.  I'm confused -- Cassi ordered at the counter, why can't I?  Anyway, I obey (like a fool).\n\nAs we're sitting, two groups of people come in.  There are two people working.  They spend the next fifteen minutes taking orders from these new customers rather than taking my order.  I was ready.  I wanted a tea.  WTF.\n\nAnyway, when I finally got to place an order, another group came in.  They ordered, they got their drinks.  Then I finally received mine.  Cassi was finished hers, we'd nearly finished our game of chess, and 30 minutes had passed.\n\nSo.  Annoyed.  Very annoyed.\n\nTea was fine, nothing special, and definitely not worth $6. It's just cheap black tea with cheap (synthetic?) flavouring, jelly, and a crapload of ice.  Kind of like paying $6 for a coke at the movie theatre, but without the movie.\n\nOh well, at least they had a chess board to give us something to do while we waited.  Can't say I'll be back.
