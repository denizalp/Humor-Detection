When you are having an eyebrow emergency that rivals Ernie & Bert I turn to Yelp for a quick fix in my area. Kat recently raved about the Four Seasons Nails & Spa at Royal York  and Bloor so I decided to hop on the subway and attempt a walk-in.\n\nI entered the small store and the first thing I noticed was the customer to esthetician ratio! There was a very impressive row of 7 women getting simultaneous manicures and behind them 5 woman getting pedicures.\n\nI requested an eyebrow and upper lip wax and was immediately taken to a back room. The service was cheap ($18 total for lip and eyebrow) and thorough. Despite getting a bit of wax in my hairline (which she cleaned up), the service was good thorough and totally affordable. \nI would recommend this place to my fellow yelpers.
