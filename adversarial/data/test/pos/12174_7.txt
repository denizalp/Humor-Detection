Mountainside is probably one of the better gaming bars I've been to in all of Las Vegas\/Henderson. It's rarely packed, and the crowd is usually not the super rowdy type (which I really appreciate). With that in mind, if you're into places with a younger crowd, this is NOT it. Perhaps it's the area, seeing as this is really the only bar near Lake Las Vegas that isn't at the Village. \n\nThe liquor selection is great; vodkas include multiple varieties of Chopin and Grey Goose, gins include Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray 10. They used to have Nolets, but apparently that was a one time thing (which is too bad). Multiple craft beers are also offered, as are beers on tap. Surprisingly, all drinks are CHEAP. Although I am not certain of the beer prices, drinks are typically $5-6 each, which is amazing considering what most bars charge. \n\nI cannot speak for the food, although there is a full menu offered. The dining room is separate from the bar so that you can have dinner without being exposed to the smoke from the bar. There never seems to be anyone dining in the dining room, so that may provide insight on the quality of the food. \n\nOverall I really like Mountainside and would probably come more often if I drank on a regular basis. I would definitely recommend checking this place out of you're in the area. My only gripe is that it can get smokey when a lot of people are in the bar area, and service can be a bit mediocre depending on who is tending the bar (see my photo of the garnish I was given and never received replacement).
