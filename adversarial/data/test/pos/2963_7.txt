Calling all stoners, Calling all stoners. Well ok not just stoners because the food here is awesome for those of us who aren't stoners too.\n\nThe menu names will make you feel like you are breaking the law just by ordering a La Canna Blunt or a Kush piner but the only thing illegal about these is how good these \"toasted\" subs taste. No matter what your mental state when you get one of these you will chow them down like you haven't eaten in day.\n\nMy personal favorite is the aforementioned La Canna fileld with your usual selection of italian meats and olives, throw on some of there pickles and you have a tasty snack to munch on. \n\nDon't forget to order one of their special brownies filled with all kinds of chocolatey fudgey goodness when you get the dessert munchies.
