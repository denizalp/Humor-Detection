Stopped here for lunch since I never ate here at the Pittsburgh Public market. Their specialties are arepas with different fillings and a Columbian beverage called Sirope. I wasn't sure I was going to like the Sirope since it is made from sugar cane pulp but it wasn't overbearingly sweet. I really liked it.  My waitress helped explain the various items on the menu and was attentive to my needs.\n\nIn addition to their specialty juices they  serve soft drinks and Columbian coffee or hot tea. I ordered the chicken arepas with avocado and a side of sweet plantains. The meal was very good and very filling. Prices are reasonable so unless you have a big appetite one arepa would be sufficient. You get a choice of side with it anyway. \n\nEverything is made fresh to order and my waitress brought me condiments to go with it but I thought my arepa was just right without having to add more to it. \n\nThe place is very small with a bar in the back. Restrooms are down a flight of stairs. The Columbian decor is very nice and this place is definitely a must return for me. It is located in the 21st block in Southside.
