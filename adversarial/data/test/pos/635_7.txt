Had a lot of great, inexpensive meals here. Despite the affordability, it is still clean, cute, and welcoming. The menu has a lot of dishes that are basically a spicy twist on traditional Chinese food (if you're not familiar with Tibetan food, that's an easy way to get the picture).\n\nLove the steamed momos (instead the fried) and the chili fries are a surprisingly pleasant appetizer. Soups are good, too.\n\nI always get greeted with a smile and good service, but I think that's because the owner thinks I'm one of the Property Brothers.
