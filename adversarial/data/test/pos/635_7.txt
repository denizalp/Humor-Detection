YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(90\/365) \"Under ATTACK!!!!\"\n\nWe were invited out to Goyemon's 3rd Annual Customer Appreciation night which I'm SO GLAD we chose to go on the first night because I hear they were wiped out of stuff and selections weren't as plentiful for the following night. We had reservations for 7pm but arrived at 6:30 and were seated pretty quickly. Then this newbie hostess proceeds to enforce the 1 hour time limit as if it was the Goyemonstah's first time here, so we say \"Cool, no prob\".....Yuki swings by and I check on the time limit to see if it starts when we place our order? or when our first order hits the table? He waves his hand, shakes his head, and I read his lips....\"Don't worry about it\".......:P  :\n\nYuki drops off our drinks and both Gio and Yuki tell us more good news. Aside from AYCE Uni, which is usually one order per person, they also have Toro and Kobe Beef which are AYCE as well, and Hamachi Kama returned  to the AYCE menu for the evening with Foie Gras Nigiri(one per person) Like a kid in a candy store, I was ready to KILL IT! People were eating rolls!?!? and not taking advantage of the specials board and the killer nigiri selection they were offering for the evening!?!? More for DA GOYEMONSTAH!!! Buahahahaha!!!! \n\nThe main focus was nigiri, so we eased up on our usual side orders(fried Amaebi Heads, Spicy Tuna Rice Crackers and Fried Calamari had to step aside) starting with a Grilled Pork Belly and a Hamachi Kama. plate after plate was cleaned a few minutes upon arrival, and after final tally, my hit list looked something like this:\nAYCE Nigiri, 2 per order:\n\nUni: X 8\nToro: X 8\nSaba: X 5\nScallop:X 3\nConch: X 3\nKobe Beef: X 5\nHamachi Belly with Jalapeno and Ponzu:X 5\nAmaebi: X 1\nFoie Gras: X 1\nSalmon Belly X 2\n\nGrilled Pork Belly: X 1\nGrilled Hamachi Kama: X 1\nTempura Ice CreamX1\nCheesecake X1\nYuzu SherbetX1\n\nWhat a grubfest it was, and I beat my old record(80) from 10 years ago by 2 more pieces! What was even sweeter is we had a filled stamp card. We thanked Yuki, Gio, and the rest of the Goyemon Boyz for yet another great evening, and I can't wait until next year's event!  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5\n\n*When you stick with the same people for 10 years, they treat you like Ohana....\\uuu\/
