You really ought to step into this place if you find yourself hungry and downtown and want to try something a little out of the way of the well-worn Fremont spots (like Carson Kitchen, Therapy, and the like), and want something a little less conventional than the other standbys (like Triple George--of which I am a fan).  This spot, to me, is a quiet gem.  At least for now.  My fear for this place is that it will yield to the massive sway of the crowds that it is now blessed by (and perhaps later, cursed by), and yield to the massive egos of the diners that it currently attracts.  If somehow the place manages to keep its own ego in check, maintains its humble stance and quiet, but strong presentation of food, it will run the race and survive well.  \n\nLet's be specific, this place serves homey, fresh, Americanized Italian-inspired, gourmet comfort food. There, I made up a category for it!  It has all the lovely pizza you can want, with little inventive touches (like Truffle cheese).  It has delicious and delightful salads (like the Quinoa with Kale--SO MUCH BETTER THAN IT SOUNDS...BELIEVE ME, TRY IT!).  It has cool but interesting standbys like a Las Vegas version of a Salade Nicoise.  Totally surprised me, in a good way!  I liked everything.\n\nI really liked the ambience, presented mostly in the decor of this fine place.  It feels like your spinster but sophisticated aunt's house that you love to go to as a kid because she never makes you keep your bedtime, and serves you food on fine china that she made from recipes from Vogue (which doesn't exist, I know).  It's fab and hip, but almost like home...you know, like your truly cool, and gracefully aging, auntie's house. I can't wait to get back there.  I think the best is the charming black and white mural of the beach on the back wall.  Perfectly complements the yellow banquets, and toile fabric occasional chairs and funky tile.  Well-done.  Service is a bit clumsy in an utterly pleasant way. Prices are reasonable for the downtown area. \n\n3 Downsides:  \n\n1) It is hard to find.  Don't let the 1129 on the street like 2 blocks down trip you up.  1130 (where this place is) is on the other end.  My GPS did not help me here.  In fact, I was walking around, deciding to go it on foot, when I saw another guy walking around who I asked, \"Do you know where Esther's Kitchen is?\" And he said, \"No way! I'm looking for it, too!\" They really have to warn diners of this.\n\n2) There is little parking.  You may have to hike it a little. Come early. For lunch or whenever.\n\n3) There are too many \"bigwigs\" that like this place already.  I won't name names, but you see the ones who make the headlines heading in here. Normally, I enjoy a little people watching. But somehow it feels intrusive in this space which feels so charming and intimate.  The fancy politicos and lawyers I saw were on good behavior. Let's just hope they stay that way, and don't ruin this place with a negative vibe.  (Mark my words.  It's been known to happen).
