I will be honest - I definitely wanted West Indian food, but came here because Bacchus was closed.  I was initially put off by the large, tacky signage and the interior murals.  My fears were quickly allayed once my double and GOAT (greatest of all time, for you LL Cool J fans) daal puri came.  Holy hell, was it all good.  I love me some good goat, and this was wonderfully tender and fatty.  The double was also amazing.  Hooray for West Indian food.
