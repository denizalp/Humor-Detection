My husband and I decided to see Dr. Shapiro, after over a year of trying to get pregnant. We went through all the testings that was recommended by Dr. Shapiro and found our problems. Our only option was IVF. \n\nDr. Shapiro was very professional and he even answered my e-mails after hours (8pm). He had great bedside manners and he was very confident that we would get pregnant.  \n\nDue to our busy schedule the fertility center was able to work around our schedule between the Sahara office and the Henderson office (we mainly went to the Sahara office). I really enjoyed the staff from the front staff to the back staff. Trish (IVF coordinator) was very helpful in answering all my questions and concerns via phone or e-mail. Gwen\/Jennifer (billing) were also very helpful in answering my questions regarding the financial. With all the blood work that I had to do, Dove is your girl. \n\nOverall, I would recommend The Fertility Center of Las Vegas. \nP.S. We are now 4 months pregnant with our first IVF cycle.
