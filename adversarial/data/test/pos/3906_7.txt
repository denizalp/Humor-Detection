It's about as \"Irish\" as New Delhi. \n  The beer is standard fare. The food is mostly Indian, with very little Irish content at all; calling something a \"Dublin club\" or a \"Belfast burger\" does not make it anything other than a club or a burger. Having said that, the portions are large. The service has been uneven on the couple of occasions I have been there.\n  If these places want to be \"authentic\", the first thing they need to get rid of is all the giant TVs blaring constantly.
