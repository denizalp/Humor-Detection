I've been dying to eat at Bouchon for years and always because of budget and time, it has never happened.  Finally the perfect oppourtunity presented itself.  After a fantastic time at Phantom, everyone was down for a nice meal and being right upstairs of the theatre, Bouchon was a natural choice.\n\nTo begin, the staff was oh so attentive.  We were introduced to the maitre-d, the oyster guy and of course our server.\n\nWhile we were walking in we were excited by the food being displayed all around us.  \n\nUs three hungry girlies got the foie gras pate to share, the grand plateau, a huge assortment of seafood, shortribs and lamb.\n\nThe foie gras, what can I say.  Five ounces of pure heaven with crispy crunchy brioche to share.  Sure it was quite pricey, $50 to be exact, but well worth every penny.  The serving was more than enough for the three of us.  \n\nThe seafood was fresh and delicious but very standard.  Next time I wouldn't order just because you can get seafood anywhere.\n\nNow I normally don't like shortrib much, but this was melt in your mouth tender with crunchy bits of parsnip, carrots and god knows what else, probably crack.  The BEST BEST BEST BEST part of the dish was two deep fried morsels on the top.  Deep fried what you ask?  Deep fried BONE MARROW.  OMG.  I thought I had died and gone to foodie heaven.\n\nThe lamb was also very good, tender, juicy, on a bed of white beans I want to say.  \n\nWe couldn't breath after the meal but we finished off with some chocolate Bouchons and a chocolate mousse.\n\nWhat an amazing meal.  I think I need to have dinner here everytime I go to Vegas now.  Slurp!
