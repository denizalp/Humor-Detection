I work very close to Mr. Mama's, close enough to walk there if I wanted to. Thankfully I do not have to do that, as Mr. Mama's delivers ($15 minimum order)!\n\nMy boss bought breakfast for the office the other morning from Mr. Mama's. I went with the egg and sausage breakfast sandwich ($3.25) with cheese added ($.75). \n\nThe breakfast sandwich was good, not really surprising though as it would have been hard to screw up such a simple order. For a cheap and simple breakfast Mr. Mama's is good if you are in the neighborhood.
