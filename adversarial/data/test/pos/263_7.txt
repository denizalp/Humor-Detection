2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45\/100\n\nI had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.\n\nIt is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!\n\nI was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery\/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables\/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees\/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.\n\nOne wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the \"biggest chocolate fountain in the world\" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.\n\nAlong the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!\n\nUnfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).\n\nThe gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.\n\nI made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.\n\nOverall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!
