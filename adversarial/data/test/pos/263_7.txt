Oh so good, so so good. I've been looking for good Thai food ever since traveling through Thailand last year. This place really hit the mark.\n\nThe Laarb was fantastic and quite spicy, just the way it should be. It was presented really beautifully with cabbage leaves and sprigs of mint leaves. I ordered the Red Curry with mixed vegetables and shrimp. Yum. Shrimp were cooked perfectly and the curry was delicious.\n\nMangoes and sticky rice for dessert too. I can't wait to go back.
