After meeting with several surgeons I chose Dr. Carlotti for several reasons for my tummy tuck and augmentation \n- he treated me like an individual during the consult. Most doctors seem to do scone size fits all evaluation. \n- he took time. Most doctors seem to want to rush you in and out of the consult on one to the finance portion. Instead Dr. Carlotti spent at least an hour with me. He answered all of my questions and explained his recommendations\n- he understands athletes. As an athlete I put my body through extreme training. He is also an athlete and so his much of his staff. I truly felt like they understand my needs \n- the entire staff is genuinely warm and caring. My only wish is that the staff was more consistent, in that I saw a lot of different faces when I was in the office. But everyone I met was just amazing. \n- I truly felt he had my best interests at heart. He is sincere and genuinely cares. \n\nI have recommended Dr Carlotti's to several people and three of my friends have also had surgeries done. I will continue to recommend them.
