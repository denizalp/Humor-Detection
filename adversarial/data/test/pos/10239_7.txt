Not the nicest neighborhood in the area but don't let the painted cinderblock exterior deceive you. The food is excellent!\n\nI was there to meet friends for a late breakfast and went with the basic ham and eggs with toast and an extra side of sliced tomatoes. The steak was pretty thick and very delicious. A friend had an omelette with biscuits which he said were delicious and another friend had the three hotcakes plate, which were huge! At least 6 inches across and quite thick! Someone else at the table was in a lunch mood and had the bbq special.\n\nThe coffee was good and hot and refilled often. Sodas are the canned variety, so no free refills there. The waitress has probably been there for years as she was friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nIt's inexpensive food, cooked with care. Enjoy it!\n\nNote that they DO NOT accept cards of any type, so bring cash.\n\nBonus: depending on the winds, you can stand in the parking lot and watch the planes on final approach into the Charlotte airport.
