Had a great time at Corkbuzz last night!  It was my second time there in two weeks.  First of all, the service was amazing!  My friend jokingly told our server we wanted to move in because it was so comfortable there.  Patrick was our server, but Cory, one of the sommeliers, helped us with some great wine and food choices (and told us a few jokes too).  He spent at least 20 minutes chatting with us throughout the night about wines.  He was fun, personable and made our night :-) Patrick was great too.  All in all, I love this place and will definitely be going back.  Oh, and the food was GREAT.  We had the warm olives (yum), crab cake, watermelon and feta salad (amazing) and the burger (wow).  I don't even eat beef...but ate that burger because it was just that good.
