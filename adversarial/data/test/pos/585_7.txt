I can't give this place enough credit, everything here is wonderful. The food the drinks the staff. It's clean the food is priced well and I love their all day Monday happy hours. If you're looking for something different from your normal boring food routine then go here. It's worth it and they even have parking. I know what you're thinking, parking in lakewood?! Yep parking in Lakewood. Lol \n\n\nAlso, Phil really knows his stuff.
