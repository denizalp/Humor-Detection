Impressed with the thin crust style pizza! we ordered the the servers suggestion of mama Spinato Signature fresh spinach, half chicken on left and sausage on right of the pizza.  The hubster and I shared the boneless wings, half hot and sweet. I enjoyed the sweet best. everything was so fresh and delicious and not overly salty. It was a little heavy but very much worth it when your treating yourself. I liked the modern feel of the restaurant.. The service was pleasant and a nice relaxed atmosphere. On tap they have the seasonal san tan mr. pineapple beer, which was unique and I would love to try again. I really don't have more to add except it was amazing pizza.
