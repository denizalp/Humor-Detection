As I was vacuuming out my car I noticed the rims were still full of suds and black grease. I called the gentleman over and he explained the wheel machine malfunctions sometimes. As he wiped the rims, we both noticed deep gouges that circled all the way around all four tires. They even have yellow transfer paint stuck in the gouges from the tire cleaning machine. I took pictures with my ipad and insisted they shut the car washed down so I could ride my vehicle through again and see what gouged my rims. As we suspected the tire machine lined up perfectly with the  circular gouges. And as you might guess the machine was bright yellow hard plastic just like the transfer paint\/plastic left behind. Sure enough, perfect match!! I have video and pics of it all.\n\nI was told to call the Vince the manager the next day. Vince told me over the phone, before he even looked at my car, that it did not happened at his car wash...  he was sure it was curb rash. Next came the meeting, after telling Vince I didn't like to drive in the city he insisted, at my inconvenience, I meet him at a location that was 40 minutes away (he happen to be 15 minutes from my home that day but he picked the furthest location away). Of course he didn't have the human integrity to take responsibility. He insisted that the damage wasn't from his machines as he attempted to scratch the transfer paint from the gouges!!! I COULD NOT BELIVE IT!!!! WHAT NERVE!!!!  I had to tell him to stop. However it would be impossible to get it all out with his finger nail...  it's so deeply imbedded.  I offered to try to find a set of used rims that were in good shape on eBay or something. Which would have only cost approximately $500 to $600. Not that this matters...  but I need to tell you how much of a slimey worm this guy is....He said  \"thousands of cars a day go through this carwash and we never have any problems\". He looked me straight in the eyes as he lied...  like a real ass. Little did he know, the night before (when my rims were damaged) his young staff members stood around and reminisced about all of the vehicles that had damaged mirrors, antennas, bumpers and even a fender on a truck. I recorded most of the conversation by accident forgetting to stop my ipad from recording.\n\nI have no other choice but to take Clean Freak Car Wash to court here in Phoenix. Sadly for them, I took video and pictures showing how the machine aligned perfectly to the damage on my rims. In addition, the transfer paint from the hard plastic tire machine sits perfectly in the gouges. And whats more, my vehicle was detailed the previous day which all three gentleman at the shop clearly remember the rims being shiny and damage free. \n\nIn court I will ask for new rims for my Audi convertible. The inconvenience and frustration of taking this issue to court is uncalled for. I can only imagine that new rims would cost Clean Freak Car Wash a few thousand dollars.  Just think it all could have been avoided.  In addition, my husband and I both work in the service industry. We come in contact with dozens of customers daily. When given the opportunity we will continue to tell everyone about the ordeal at Clean Freak Car Wash.\n\nIf you have experienced damage to your vehicle caused by Clean Freak Car Wash now or in the past (maybe you have pics)  email me at my Gmail email address or call now. \n\nCleanFreakCarWashSucks@G...     \n                                           @Gmail.com                    \n\nYelp doesn't print the full address...   it's a Gmail account\n\nor call\/text me at 623-606-4332 \n\nTHANKS A BUNCH,\nValerie Kahler\n\n*****LOCAL NEWS STATIONS ARE INTERESTED!!!\n\nNEWS STATIONS WITH CONSUMER ADVOCATES...\n~ABC 5  KPHO  Dave Cherry, telling it like it is\n~AZ Central   Call 12 for action\n~abc 15   Joe Ducey\n~Fox 10 news Consumer advocacy\n~3 On your side    AZ family news\n~City of Phoenix office of Customer Advocacy
