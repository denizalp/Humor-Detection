Toronto has its own little Tokyo in Markham\n\nIts a series of independent owned shops serving up food, fresh sushi grade fish, Wagu beef and other specialty items\n\nOk so its not the Akhibara for electronics those shops are up the street BUTit is the mecca for the best in japanese food\n\nI was also able to purchase some kitchen items (yes they have a pickle press and wonderful Bento boxes) as well as a great assortment of Japanese magazines and books.\n\nI swear they must have 12 different Togarashi condiments to choose from\n\nI suggest you time your visit so that you are hungry enough to have a sit down take out meal and grab some bakery items for the ride home.\n\nThe green tea cakes shaped like crabs are a must.\n\nAlso the pricing is reasonable and the Miso soup packages are cheaper than the other asian stores\n\nThe only thing missing from the real deal in Tokyo is you wont get run over in the fish market by the crazy Tsikiji fork lift truck drivers, you wont be ordering your ramen noodles from a vending machine and no irasshaimase greeting by kimono clad ladies\n\nIts a great shopping experience and is spread across a few buildings and the owners are super friendly
