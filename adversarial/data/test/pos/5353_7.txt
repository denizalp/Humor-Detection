Such an awesome time. This year I had the pleasure of bringing my little Princess with me. She must have been mind blown. Upon arrival we parked on a front lawn of an apartment building. I had to reverse it on the sidewalk and park it on the lawn.  \n\nWe had Lamb-kabob, delicious. The mix of people, plethora of food and just the atmosphere is breath-taking. \n\nI try to go every year and check out all the guidos, biggest douche this year had a Sopranos t-shirt on. My Daughter kept making me stick out my arm so she can limbo, shes awesome. We both had Gelato for the first time. \n\nWe stayed til close and left with a sense of fulfillment.
