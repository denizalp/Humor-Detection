Ahipoki! My brother and I came here for lunch since we both wanted to try this place, and we're both fans of sushi and this seemed to be a similar concept. We got there around 12 noon and it was fairly busy but with the setup, it moves fast. It did get crowded at the entrance since the line was long so it started to double up and wrap around, it would be good to have more room there. It was easy to order; started with a base of half white rice and half greens regular size. It comes with 2 scoops of seafood, and I chose spicy tuna and shrimp. The shrimp spoonful was pitiful so I wouldn't get it again, though it tasted good. My brother got the large bowl with brown rice and salmon, tuna, and spicy tuna. You choose which sauce you'd like and we both got the house spicy, which was good.\n\nAfter, you choose your toppings. It was marked clearly on the menu but then when you get to the area you forget what the options are and have to look at all the compartments to figure out what you want. They had edamame, but it wasn't written on their menu, FYI. So I got that, green onions, pickled ginger, cucumber, sprouts and sesame seeds. I also got the seaweed salad but I don't recommend that personally. \n\nInteresting that they come in to-go boxes and bowls, wonder why they don't do regular bowls but maybe it's to save water? Hope they recycle but I didn't get a chance to see if they had a bin next to the trash.\n\nI enjoyed my food and my Thai iced tea and it is definitely a healthier option than most places. I'd come back if I was in the area.
