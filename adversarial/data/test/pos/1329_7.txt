Sisters, we need not  make peace with our mustaches, beards, or uni-brows.  Nor should we, and if you're reading this review I am assuming you haven't (kudos to you, treat yo self with respect).  \n\nI have tried every method known to man to have a bald face.  I went to multiple locations in my home-town of Southern California, and I was never satisfied for various reasons.  They either left stray hairs (infuriating), took way too long (painful), salivated all over the thread (gross), or left me with a red, burning face (might as well wax it myself in the privacy of my own home).  There is nothing worse than paying for a job I could do better myself. \n\nMy mom had been raving about Khina since she started going to her over a year ago, so we made it a point to drive out to her new shop. I wound up being so satisfied with the experience that I decided to write my first review on Yelp.  Decided to even reveal to Facebook friends that I have a mustache.  Yes, she was that good. \n\nKhina got every single hair, it was completely painless, she only took about 5 minutes, and over a week later I still don't have any regrowth.  Khina is the absolute best and I have decided threading is THE way to deal with this situation.  You just have to find someone who is a pro like Khina.  The next time I am in Henderson I will definitely be paying her a visit.
