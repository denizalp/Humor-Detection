I shopped for a heated\/massage recliner and was surprised at how few choices there were in their huge Recliner Cinema. I hadn't found anything better anywhere else, so I purchased one. A couple weeks later it was delivered, and although it's not exactly what I hoped, it's pretty good. I wasn't sure it was what I had actually ordered, so I called last night and the receptionist took a message for the salesperson to call me back, but she never did. I went to the store today and dealt with a 60-something or so salesman. Although he answered all my questions and I'm confident what I ordered is what I got, he was creepy. He's one of those old men who think they are funny. If just one or two lame comments were made, I could have ignored it. But it was over and over and over. Never a straight, simple answer. Otherwise Sedlak was ok to deal with.
