Let me start off by saying if given the choice to either have a colonoscopy or go to the South Side at night on the weekend...I would have a serious debate on my hands. Between the 21st birthdays, bachelorette parties, mascara smeared girls crying over a recent break up, and the testosterone induced, overly aggressive affliction wearing individuals, I have a hard time conjuring up much desire to make my way through the labyrinth of Pittsburgh's finest. \n\nFortunately for us, there are some gems on this boulevard of broken dreams. Club Cafe happens to be one of those gems. It is a wonderful spot for those who enjoy entertaining their earlobes with the sound of music minus Julie Andrews. \n\nThe stage is small but close. The overall atmosphere here is rather chill and great for a relaxing evening. The price is right (Bob Barker also not included) with a small menu for food but a good one. Believe it or not, despite what you may think, you actually don't even have to drink here. If you feel like hanging out with a cup o' joe here..it works..I've done it. From what I hear too they have a pretty happening breakfast but I can't speak for it myself....yet.\n\nTypically there will be a cover for any music there but assuming it's a band you want to see, it's rather reasonable. So if you find yourself in need of a place to go on the weekend and you feel like delving to the 7th circle of hell location wise...check out Club Cafe, you won't be disappointed.
