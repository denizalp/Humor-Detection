The worst \"up-sell\" player I have encountered.  The tech advised that I needed new springs on my garage doors, as ours was too old. (?) He wanted 180.00 to fix my opener...and ANOTHER $300 for new springs.  No doubt I must have appeared to be either stupid or an easy pidgin.  Went to Lowes...bought the top of the line opener and they installed it the next day....\nPS The tech told me Lowes charges $185 for install and they only charge $100.00.  The new opener was under $200.\nLooks like I am not the only one with supposed \"bad springs.\"
