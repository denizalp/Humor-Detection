It's funny how tastes can change over time. On my original review I wrote how I prefer the light roast over the dark roast at Parliament. I've totally flipped, and I probably will again, and again. These are both outstanding coffees!\n\nThe light roast definitely retains the original subtle flavors better, as with any light roast. You could say that it's a more \"complex\" flavor that has a floral taste to it.\n\nThe dark roast is bold, more bitterness to it which gives the roast a rich profile. More oils are pulled out of the bean, you get an almost chocolate aroma with a full body. I don't know how or why, but I've quickly switched over to this as my go-to. I've gotten to the point where I don't even add cream or milk to this, just a touch of raw sugar.\n\nWith 17 \"Check-ins\" and counting, I'm still a huge advocate of Parliament. I've definitely broadened my horizons with more coffee shops under my belt, and I've even started making cold brew at home. The key here for me is the $1 reusable cup refills, you simply can't beat that value for a 14oz coffee in the middle of Uptown!
