Food so. Oxtail broth so so however not sure of it was cooked in the kitchen or bathroom. No other cuatomers. Just me and 400 tables. Bathtoom. Omg. I say again omg. Smells like a dungeon sewer. Under the sink was a cookimg tong in the bathroom. Urinal was broken. Restaurant it self smells horrid. Food way over priced. How this place was featured on the food network is amazing. I would not let my dog eat here.  Yuck.  I could not wait to leave and throw up.
