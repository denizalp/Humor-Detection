I've had this review sitting in my queue for several weeks, and I wanted to wait until their season was over before finishing it off.\n\nI'll be honest, a near decade of no playoff appearances, ownership changes, coaching changes, heart-aches, heart breaks, and ridiculously priced tickets have made me a pessimist, add to it this years strike and I had decided I was on strike from hockey this season. \n\nThen something beautiful happened, our team of youngsters started to amaze even me, the most negative and critical fan. They made the playoffs, not by the skin of their teeth barely eeking into 8ths place but did so in a convincing fashion finishing 5th in the East. \n\nMoving into this years playoffs, the had to take on one of their biggest obstacles, the 2011 Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins, whom they had lost 9 of their last 11 meetings to. A team that certainly had their number! But did they give up? NO! Our boys in blue pulled it together and took Boston to the edge of a 7th game in overtime before losing to a more experienced squad, NOT a better squad. \n\nI write this review of your performance to say THANK YOU! Thank you for a fantastic season and proving to Toronto fans that we really do have one of the best teams in the NHL and we \"BeLEAF\" in you all!\n\nWith renewed faith in our team, I anxiously look forward to supporting you guys without a question next season!!!
