My fianc√©e and I have lived within walking distance of Ocotillo for over a year and finally made the trip for brunch on Sunday. We were a little disappointed with where we were seated, at a shared picnic table with some people lamenting their hangovers and recalling some of the sketchy things they had done the night before. Apparently a reservation is recommended to sit on the patio we wanted to sit at, which we will definitely do next time. I had a couple different drinks, the hard lemonade and a mimosa, both were very good. We shared a few of the brunch options including the fried chicken with polenta, the broccolini quiche, and the breakfast chimichanga. The servings were a lot larger than we had anticipated, so next time we'll only be ordering a dish each. The quiche and the fried chicken were our favorites, but we are excited to try some of the other dishes next time! We will be back, with a patio reservation.
