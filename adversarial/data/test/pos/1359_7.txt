What...In...The...WORLD were people thinking giving this place any more than one star?? This food is just nasty and the absolute lowest grade meat you could possibly eat! Trust me, I know about this stuff. The meat is DISGUSTING!  Best in Vegas award? Something tells me they know somebody who knows somebody. That is the biggest lie I've heard since moving here! Oh yeah, and they're over priced! What a joke. I so regret giving them my money.
