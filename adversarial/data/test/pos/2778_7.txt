On my recent dress shop tour of Queen West, I stopped by Original to see what it was all about. I hadn't really seen much about it online, but I did know they carried some dresses and most likely some original pieces so I figured I'd check it out. \n\nOriginal is located on Queen street and is sort of oddly placed among non-fashionish stores. This store was the last fashion store heading east on Queen for a few blocks. You really can't miss it with the brightly colored dresses and window displays. In particular, there was a gorgeous dress in the front window (probably what made me think I'd find another beautiful dress inside).\n\nI headed inside and there were a few people milling about near the front of the store shopping. They left shortly after I entered so I was the only customer and there were two sales people, one sitting down and the other trying on some weird suit... I would say it looked like a Barney suit but it was blue and very big on him. But I digress...\n\nThe store is crazy bright with STUFF everywhere. Feather boas, hooker heels and shoes shoes shoes. This really isn't a \"fashion\" store in terms of clothing. The clothing selection here is incredibly limited and considering that's what I came for (being lead to believe that they had more clothes) it just didn't do it for me. If you're looking for shoes, well then you should probably come here. \n\nOverall, this was one of those stores that I walked into, walked halfway through and then turned around and walked back out. I'm sure if I was looking for something kinda crazy that I could have found it here but that wasn't the mission I was on.
