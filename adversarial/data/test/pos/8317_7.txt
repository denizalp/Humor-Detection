The Chef here uses a special traditional Japanese charcoal that is completely different from American charcoal, to grill pork cheek, mountain trout and a long list of fireside cooking at this elegant izakaya.\n\nOn my research on the charcoal - it is chemical free, almost smoke free and burns threes times hotter than the regular charcoal for up to 4-5 hours. The lack of chemicals and incredible high heat preserves it's natural juices.\n\nTry the agedashi tofu - it's a silken house-made tofu topped with salmon roe - it's to die for.
