I ordered Rocco's with Postmates. The delivery and timing was fine but the food is very disappointing. I ordered the chicken parm and mozzarella sticks. The chicken parm is so over cooked that it's hard to cut through with a knife. The portions are large so that's a plus but it will mostly go to waste as it is not worth saving the leftovers. My dogs will enjoy it.  Mozzarella sticks are ok but nothing to rave about. The salad came without dressing... I guess it's byo salad dressing. The only thing saving this place from a one star rating are their garlic knots which they threw in for free. Not everyone can make great garlic knots but this place has done very well.\n\nSorry Rocco's you won't be seeing any orders from me again.
