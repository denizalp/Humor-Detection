The closest QT to my house and one of the newer ones in the Charlotte area (relatively speaking, all of their stores are less than 3 years old). I go to a lot of QuikTrip stores throughout the week and I can tell you that this one follows the company's standards of cleanliness very well. Trash cans outside are emptied regularly and employees are always out cleaning up somebody else's mess (shame on people!). Heck, one day I even saw an QT associate pressure washing in front of the door, impressive!\n\nI can't stress this amenity enough: All QuikTrip stores have FREE AIR! Who would ever have thought we'd be cruising all around Charlotte looking for a place to top off a tire without being robbed by an air compressor? I pulled into another gas station the other day and their compressor had a $1.50 fee, complete with a credit card reader, what is this?! Thank you QT, for the free air, it means a lot.\n\nIt makes me wonder if someday in the near future, might we have to pay for regular air to breathe? I digress...\n\nIf you're going up or down Tryon St. the store is easy enough to pull into. Northbound just turn right into the place and southbound will need to turn onto Pavilion Blvd, then right at the movie theater. If you're on Salome Church Rd. (most people would know it as Ridge Rd, it changes names near Hwy 29) you're outta luck. You're forced to turn right, away from the store, then the only place to make a (legal) U-turn is about 1-1\/2 miles up the road, bummer!\n\nEverything you would expect at a convenience store can of course be found here. Fresh pizza, milkshakes, hot dogs, and a huge selection of snacks are all QuikTrip staples. Thank you QT for clean stores, clean restrooms, and most of all FREE AIR!
