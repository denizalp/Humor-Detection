Just had the best service experience! Walked in just to get a price on a new deck for an old truck and was given such a great price on deck,parts and install I decided to gamble and just do it. I had the truck back in 45 minutes, install looks clean and well done and everything works as advertised! What else could you want. Chapo the owner was no nonsense and didn't try and upsell anything. Definitely going back for upgraded speakers. If your looking for a car stereo place, look no further this is it!
