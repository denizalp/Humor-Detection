I got take out.\nBut it wasnt bad.. it wasnt great.. it wasnt memorable. I expectd way better based on others reviews and pictures. So... I cant even explain.\nWe got a #27 and a #23. Bother were lacking in spice, flavor, uniqueness. Seriously I was so underwhlemed and upset. I was just eating to eat... I do not recommend.
