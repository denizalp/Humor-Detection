I have been coming to the Bullring for years. Since the time that the backstretch was actually the front and the stands faced the setting sun. Those were the days before real restrooms and snack stands were built. And if you look closely at the back stretch you can see where the old victory lane was. History is awesome.\n\nNow that your history lesson is over, lets talk about the present. The Bullring is still a top notch racing facility. Being a 3\/8 mile oval means that there is not a bad seat in the house. There is one seat in particular that I prefer and it is up where the benches have backs. That starts around row 15. Below that and you have no back support. Still, you can see the entire track from wherever you choose to sit. There is plenty to see here. So many different classes of racecars. From a young age, kids start in the Bandelero class. Then they might move up to the Legends and Thunder Cars. From there you have the Bombers (my favorite), the Super Stocks, Modifieds (loud and fast), and Late Models. There is no shortage of racing action. \n\nOn any given Saturday you will see qualifying, heat races, trophy dashes and feature races. There are touring series like USAC Midget cars and last night had the North American Big Rigs. It was almost hard to see these trucks hauling a$$ through all their exhaust. Then on special nights you might get a demolition derby, waterless boat races (cars towing boats with no trailer), monster trucks, drift cars, and a jet powered dragster that melts another car. The fireworks on the track may even transfer to the sky for a fireworks show to end the evening. I am speaking of course of the annual Night of Fire held every year on July 3rd. This is the summer send off at the Bullring and one that is worth the trip. It is excitement galore.\n\nThe magic here is that the Bullring has stayed open through tough economic times. When other tracks across the country have either closed or delayed opening, the Bullring has remained steady. Inflation has dictated higher ticket prices and the end of $1 hot dogs (now $2) and $1 beers (now $2 or $3). It is still an affordable way to entertain yourself for a few hours at a time. It is still cheaper than a two hour movie with a large popcorn and Coke and a night at the Bullring lasts three times as long.
