I went in for a reading and she spent about 10% of the session advising me on how dour my future was and the other 90% explaining why I needed to book more sessions with her. She told me she would need at least another session to help me, which would be  $140 in cash that she needed on the spot. I stupidly got it and booked the next session. I showed up and she wasn't there, I called and left a message. She called back 2 days later to say she wasn't able to get a sitter. Nice. I came back and this time she had her kids there. She took me into a sketchy makeshift back room and spent the hour getting up during the reading to go yell at her kids (at least 3 times!) and the rest of the time telling me how damaged I was and that there was nothing she could do for me unless I booked another 10 sessions for over $1000. She told me if I didn't get healed in the next 2 months, I would end up in a terrible relationship with a divorced man who already had kids and would eventually get divorced as well. THANK GOODNESS I didn't buy into it. I met my boyfriend 2 weeks later, who's a a life coach, never been married\/no kids, and for the past year and a half have been in the best relationship of my life and the happiest I've ever been. My advice -  If you're in a vulnerable state beware of being taken advantage of (and leave your debit card at home!)
