I was super disappointed. My husband and I literally walked in, went to the bar, was ignored by the bartender, looked at the menu, and walked out. The vibe was weird, no actual food on the menu, and the beer selection consisted of 6 brews and they were mostly guest brews and not their own. If you are going to go to a brewery, support one of the other really great breweries in the valley.
