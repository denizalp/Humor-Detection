Absolutely no and never again. First of all, $9.98 for chicken lomein that's half oil and half soy sauce? I could barely pick up the noodles with my chopsticks because they were covered in oil. No thanks.\n\nBut the main reason this place gets one star (and less if I had the option) is that there is no soap in the bathroom. I went to wash my hands before I ate, and I noticed that there was no more soap; therefore, I did the courteous thing and asked the female cook that there was none, and she told me that they had no more! What restaurant doesn't carry a backup of soap?! I'm assuming the men's room didn't have any either, which means that every time the cooks used the bathroom, they didn't clean their hands! I gagged. Any restaurant that doesn't even stock the most basic way of cleaning your hands is disgusting.\n\nDirty hands, oily noodles, and inflated prices for unsanitary and just flat out bad food. No thanks.
