I absolutely loveeee Zinburger!!!!! I went for the first time a few years ago at the Phoenix location and I loved it.   \n\nThe first time I went I ordered the breakfast burger. This comes with avocado, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and the best part? A fried egg on top! It was delicious!!! This time I ordered the Blanco burger. This comes with avocado, pico de gallo, cheese, and a chipotle mayo. This one was also to die for! I washed everything down with a watermelon mojito that was very refreshing. And don't forget to get their fries! They're huge enough to share and they have a few options that will not disappoint you. My bf and I shared the truffle fries. The truffle sauce that comes with it was just icing on the cake. If you get a chance try their shakes too. I got the salted caramel shake one time and it was one of the best shakes I've had. \n\nI really believe that everything is delicious on their menu so you won't be disappointed. It was a beautiful day to sit outside on their nice patio which also have heat warmers and the service was spectacular. I'll be back!!! =)
