4.5 stars - minus 0.5 stars for the veal that I didn't enjoy. \nStarted the night with a martini and it was a delicious drink, and strong - left me buzzed the whole night. I wish I wasn't, so I could have enjoyed the food better. \nWe ordered the degustation menu which turned out to be a little too much for me since there's four courses. Started with an amuse bouche of foie gras mousse which was excellent, followed by our appetizers, a sauteed foie gras and nantucket bay scallops. Both are delicious but I made a mental note to order foie gras next time I'm here because that's the better one. \nFor fish we both ordered the paupiette of seabass, crispy potatoes, braised leeks in pinot noir reduction. Good but didn't blow me away. \nHere's the winner - the kobe beef. I'm not a beef person and so I didn't order this because I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it at $65 extra. REGRET. Husband ordered this and kobe beef is really something else. The texture and flavor is simply out of this world. I despise my veal after tasting it. You know, when you feel like you married the wrong guy? Could have been savoring that kobe beef instead of the drab boring veal. Maybe if I've never met kobe beef, the veal would have been alright. \nDessert - order the chocolate ball and see the chain effect. The table next to us ordered one and we decided we had to get one. When ours came the new table next to us saw that and decided they had to order one too. It is literally white chocolate icecream encased in a frozen chocolate shell. The server then pours hot melted chocolate over the ball and you watch as the outer shell melt away to reveal the icecream inside. It's such a visual treat.\nService, I quote Minners N. - \"impeccable\" and \"genuine\". Not only are the service professionals extremely attentive, they are not pretentious like some other places I've been to.  They don't serve you, they take care of you. \nWill I shell out that kind of money to eat here again? Hellya!
