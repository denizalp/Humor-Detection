This place is filthy.  \n\nSo I booked a room here and after driving nearly 10 hours, I come into the hotel. Here's my experience.  \n\n1. The check-in line. Okay, like any hotel, the checkin line is usually long. But this place. They take their sweet time and have employees running back and forth not really helping speed up the processes. There were a few people just standing there just staring at the line. Really? Do you work there?  \n\n2. Checking in: The black lady who helped me was completely rude, as I looked \"too young\" to book a hotel, check in, and even be in a place in vegas. I told her that I booked the room. She then asks me to go find my parents. I tell her that I booked the room once again, and she told me \"I'm sure your parents booked it for you, where are they? Are you lost?\" I show her my license and she looks dumbfounded about my age. Okay strike one. Then as she's checking in for my reservation, apparently I didn't even make a reservation at the hotel and starts asking if I have proof that I booked a room and asked if I was even at the right hotel. I show her the email on my phone. The types in the code and then finds me. Really lady? You have my license and can't type my last name correctly? Strike two. She finally checks us in. And gives me the keys. She tells me we're all set. I ask where the elevators are. She said, \"You can go find it yourself by following the signs above\". Really lady? Why can't you just tell me? Rude as hell. Strike three.  \n\n3. Get into the room: So after we check in, driving nearly 10hrs, and the drama from the rude lady, we get in our room and relax. I go to use the bathroom and it's DIRTY. Pee stains and poop stains on the toilet. Are you kidding me? So I go to the bedroom and call the front desk about the issue. Lady asks me whats wrong. I explain. She complains to me that I caused the issue, and I argue that she can send someone up. So she does. 20minutes later, someone comes. He says sorry and says he'll rush us a new room.  \n\n4. Get into our second room: Our second room is clean and one of their updated rooms. It was nice. Minus the fact that they had an extra TV stand in the middle of the room and a cabinet that was broken. I was pissed but decided to let it go. I moved the TV stand and went on to finally use the bathroom and unwind.  \n\nI will never be coming here again.
