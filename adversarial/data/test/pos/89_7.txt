OK. I get that it is Superbowl Sunday and most places are dead, but come on! We love the food here. Been going to this place for at least 15 years or more. If I could eat five gallon buckets of their carne adovado and never gain an ounce, life would be complete. But alas, I'm not into throwing up.\nSo, we did not feel like staying home for the \"big game\" and we're kinda not into huge crowds. (also we aren't popular enough to get invited to any Superbowl parties.) ( At least none with out squirrel sloppy Joe's.) Inside joke.\nSo we venture on over to one of our favorite spots. Normally I can tolerate football here as they keep the sound off and play great music while my guy takes in his game (I hate football) and I take in great wine and great eats. We had heard that for the Cards playing in the Super Bowl they would have the sound up and the game live. I have home town spirit so what the heck, it's only once a year.\nWe sat down right at 4:00 and the pregame stuff wasn't even on. The place was deserted as expected with a few seated tables and a couple of guys at the bar. After a guy complained that the game was not on, the bar tender asked us, \"what channel is the game on\"? Then he acted all pissed that he had to turn the game on.\nMy man asked if the sound was supposed to be on and the hostess replied, \"yeah, they're working on it\". We miss the national anthem (how unpatriotic Rich). There was another 15 minutes of the men in the bar freaking out that they were watching the Cards play in the Super Bowl with no sound. I suggested that we check to see if the sound is up at Dick's hide away and we could all just pick up our beers and walk over there. The bartender was so blase about it all as he announced that he hated football and he could care less. Finally he reached up, stuck a cable into the main box and presto, sound. Still the whatever attitude from the bartender. \nTime to order wine for my guy. He asked for the wine list and the bartender (Brandon)) says \"should I pick one for you\"? He says, \"No, I'll pick it\". The guy pours my date a sip of red and shoves it at him. He is shocked but tastes it to be polite. It is good so he says, \"that's good\". The cocky ass bartender says, \"that's why I'm on this side of the bar and you are over there\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \nFor the rest of what is a very exciting game (yes, I watched AND cheered) the staff out numbered the customers and we sat and listened to how badly they wanted to go home and it sucked for them to be there. Brandon the bartender was the biggest offender, (followed by that stuck on herself ,horrid, red head server that they float around to all three restaurants) bitching and texting the whole time. We have to yell his name out to get more food or drink refills at least six times. If he was not so into the game my date would have flipped out and left. You know, the food is fabulous here but the whole excitement of the game was a bit dampened by such crappy service. I mean, we didn't write the work schedule dude! \nI look at it this way. You are a bartender on a notoriously slow shift. You only work for tips. Do you piss off the few customers you do have, or do you take extra good care of the ones you have so you can make some money for you effort? Next year I'm having a party or staying home.\nIf I go back into the bar at Richardson's and Brandon is there, I'm leaving for Dick's right away.
