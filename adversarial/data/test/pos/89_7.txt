It's winter.  Cold, snowy, and bleak.  Humbling.  But wherever will you go for some birthday party antics?  \n\nWe headed to Vitense to check out their new indoor mini-golf.  Each hole is designed around a Madison landmark with lots of little interactive do-dads.  Requisite gaggle of kids running around and I stopped keeping score after about 10 minutes.  \n\nFun times but indoor mini-golf can be pretty cramped.  Head back in the summer and check out the outdoor links and driving range.
