Once again, I visited Cornish Pasty while in Vegas, but this time I brought friends with me. We had gone hiking in Red Rock Canyon on a surprisingly cold, windy, and rainy day so a warm, filling pasty was the perfect food to chase away the hunger and chills.\n\nAgain, my husband and I shared the vegetarian rosemary chicken pasty because it's just that damn good. And then we also ordered one of the day's vegan options, a peppered steak pasty. Both were delicious, but I was a little confused as the where the vegan \"steak\" was in the one pasty. After hunting around for it and then asking our friendly server, it appears that NO vegan pasties contain mock meat as this establishment only using Quorn brand products which contain egg, making them vegetarian-friendly but not appropriate for vegans. Good to know but it was a bit perplexing that they don't come right out and state that. Nonetheless, the vegan pasties are still awesome and creative. However, I do hope that Cornish Pasty will consider using one the of many brands of vegan mock meats in addition to (or even instead of) Quorn so that vegans have heartier options. Beyond Meat and Gardein both have delicious vegan mock meats so I'd think it would be a very simple amendment to their very veg-friendly menu. \n\nOh yes, and hooray for happy hour ($1 off draft beers)! I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas.
