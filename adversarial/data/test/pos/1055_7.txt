The two gelato flavors I tried were awsome.  E. R. recommended the pear and gorgonzola, which was unusual but really good.  Yes, could actually taste the cheese in the gelato and it was GOOD.  The green tea with kitkat was very good but not all that different from other green tea ice cream I've had.  The servers were very friendly and offered samples of anything from their case you'd want to try.  Great parking and long evening hours, too.
