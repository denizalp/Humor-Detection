Have you ever walked into a Greek restaurant that was PACKED in Arizona? Most likely not. However, when you walk into Greek Wraps and taste their food, you'll understand why they're SO busy. \n\nHands down the BEST gyro pita I've ever had in Arizona. I wish it was in more locations, since Peoria is a bit far from me. If you're ever in the area and you're craving a Gyro Pita - this is a MUST STOP!! \n\nThe only downside of this place is- it makes all other gyro pitas inferior in comparison.
