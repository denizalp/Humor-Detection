Haven't stayed at the Four Seasons since I live Vegas, but I gotta say they have one of the best pool area cafes in town. Appetizers are amazing. Great dessert selection. Service is top notch, but again it's the Four Seasons... Oh the restrooms, my favorite restrooms on the entire strip. Worth the trip! I'm gonna suggest something silly. Next time you're in Mandalay Bay and feel the need to visit the restroom, walk over to Four Seasons. Talk about delayed gratification. Jeesus, never thought I would be reviewing restrooms, but I did mention the cafe.
