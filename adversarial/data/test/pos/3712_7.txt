Very tiny and cramped space, so go early or make a reservation, and hope that you're not seated near the door, as there is nothing between you and the winter wind when it's opened. The food here is made from scratch and very fresh, and I very much enjoyed my lunch of house salad and soup of the day, which was a tangy and delicious tomato bisque. The salad is very lightly dressed with a minty vinaigrette and was tasty. I would go with the veggie sampler next time, as my husband ordered ti and it was great. I have had the chicken tagine and found it swimming in a little too much oil for my taste. Great place to go if you're a vegetarian.
