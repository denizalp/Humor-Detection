I am greatly offended by the \"Contemporary Christian Rock\" soundtrack running constantly at Hokkaido buffet. I went for lunch, not to try to be converted and baptized with soy sauce. Duh, it's a no-brainer to put on something like soft Japanese music in a sushi place named Hokkaido, but droning Country Western Rock singing \"Jeeezus Touched me... Oh his greatnessss... blah blah blah,\" no thanks.\nOutside of that, the food was reasonably good. I liked the sushi, but the chocolate fountain is unwelcome. Who wants to smell chocolate along with sushi? Certainly not me. Their pork shau mai weren't good at all, thick wrappers and a filling like a cheap meatball. Soups weren't good, gloppy, thick, sweet. If you pick and choose, you can have a pretty good lunch for a pretty good price, but bring ear plugs if you don't want to have religious music crammed down your throat.
