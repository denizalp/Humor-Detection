My wife and I went to Roka Akor for Valentine's Day.  I love sushi, however she does not and we thought this would be a good balance of choice. \n\nOverall, the vibe, d√©cor, and experience are great.  We liked the general vibe.\n\nWe chose to partake in the prix fixe menu for V-day and the first couple of dishes were very good, not mind-blowing, but very good.  As the meal went on nothing about any of the dishes stood out to us, which is not a good thing at this price point.  You won't find more expensive sushi\/Japanese in the Scottsdale\/Phoenix area!  \n\nService was merely decent, but I can live with that on such a busy night.\n\nHowever, the part that delivers the 2 star rating came shortly after we left and intended on continuing our night out on the town...  we both got, uh, uncomfortably ill at roughly the same time and spent the rest of our night alternating between the bathroom and the bed.  NOT the recipe for a romantic Valentine's Day!  \n\nI know these things happen, but violently ill on V-Day tells me we likely won't be back anytime soon...
