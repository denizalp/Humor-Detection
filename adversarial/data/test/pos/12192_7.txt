I can't comment on cleanliness or quality, as I didn't end up getting my tattoo here, but I still felt the need to review the shop.\n\nThe pricing was bull. They definitely tried to screw me.\n \nAfter seeing all the great yelp reviews, I decided that I was going to get my arm cuff tattoo that I've been wanting to get for a few months while I was here on vacation. Why not, it's vacation, right? So I pop down on Saturday afternoon. The shop is empty, except for a gentleman working the counter and an artist. I said I was curious about pricing for a tattoo. So I explain it's 7 words, all black, around my arm in just a simple script. (I have 5 other tattoos, but they're all hidden, so I really feel like this is where he thought he could screw me over, because he couldn't see I already have ink. I looked like a tourist getting a tattoo on a whim. Unfortunately for them, I am well aware of general tattoo rates for quality work.) They tried to tell me that for those 7 words, in all black, it would cost $250. I'm sorry, but the tattoo I want will take a max of 45 minutes to complete, and should cost under $100. I have an 8 inch tall, full color, hand drawn tattoo that took 4.5 hours to do, and it only cost $250. (That was in New Orleans at Electric Ladyland Tattoos. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.) I have another 7 inch tall, full color tattoo that cost me $175. (That was in Chicago, at Deluxe Tattoo, also highly recommend.) Telling me small, black words will cost more than either of my meduim sized full color pieces does not sit well with me. \n\nThe other thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that the shop was EMPTY and he told me that I should make an appointment for a tattoo. You really don't want walk-ins? The entire time I was staying there, I never saw anyone getting ink in that shop. And I just walked in on you not working, and you're going to tell me to make an appointment? No thanks, I'll take my business elsewhere.
