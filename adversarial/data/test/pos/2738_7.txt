Why would I like Fa-me Caffe? I can't even pronounce it or spell it. Is it Fa'me with the French thing above the a? Or Fa-me with a hyphen? And don't get me started on the two Fs in Caffe. Ha ha. Who cares, cause the food is tres bon! Oh my god we loved it! We drive by all the time and just today went for the first time. I never order omelettes because I prefer eggs over easy or eggs Benedict. And if I do order an omelette I have to put ketchup on it. But Fa-me doesn't have eggs Benedict so now I am just pointing at things written on their menu board. My wife ordered the breakfast wrap and iced mocha. Well...now the fun begins. The mochas are fantastic. And we ran into a person my wife knows from high school. They raved about the oatmeal and said that is what they always order. Now I am wishing I had ordered oatmeal.\nNow for my food review. The food arrived and looked good. But tasted even better! My omelette with mushrooms and caramelized onions was so so good! I felt like I was in Paris sharing an incredible meal with my gorgeous wife at a cozy little French bistro. Of course I knew I was in America just by looking up at the egg cartons glued to the ceiling, and the 105 degrees outside - but still...such a great tasting, well thought out breakfast with crispy bacon just the way we like it - and the cheese in my light and fluffy omelette so perfect with the onions. I think you just converted me into an omelette lover. So perfect that if I were the chef and I saw a customer putting ketchup on it I'd throw them out of the restaurant immediately, lol.\nAs for Rebecca's wrap full of potatoes, 5 stars from her as well! The green salsa is the best! And my wife is very picky about salsa. She is an Arizona native and knows her salsas. She said it was so fantastic she could drink it. Seriously. We bought more of it to take home. We don't have tortilla chips so we just may be drinking salsa tonight while reflecting on or wonderful 5 star experience at Fa-me Caffe with two Fs. We'll be back for sure. I'll be trying the oatmeal or possibly doing the omelette again with salsa on it this time!
