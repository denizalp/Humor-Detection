My son's school had a graduation here in their mini theater. It was perfect, adequate seating for the event, roller coaster shuttles ran the attendees to and from the parking garage. Lots of events at once, with a graduation literally leaving as we went in. Lots of walking is the shuttles are on break(ok I need the cardio), so wear appropriate shoes. \nThanks for a smooth experience!
