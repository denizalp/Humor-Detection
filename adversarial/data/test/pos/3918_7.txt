Why would a Hooters survive in Vegas? If you want to ogle women, the servers at better casinos are just as good looking and wear skimpier outfits. When I visited, the servers wore heavy makeup and looked pretty hard core. I never did go for the short shorts and pantyhose look. These are industrial strength pantyhose, more like a leotard. It's hard to appreciate nice legs when they're sheathed in sausage casing.\n\nI just had a hamburger. It was good. The beer selection wasn't much. There were some kids scampering about. I never thought of Hooters as a family venue.\n\nI have a hunch why Hooters hangs on in Vegas: Mormons!  Vegas has a sizable Mormon population. As you may know, these guys are as straight as they come. They never have lust in their hearts (outside the home). But when the wife's out of town, they probably like to get a little naughty.  Walk on the wild side.\n\nWhile some guys go for a wild night in a strip club, Mormons probably get their kicks at Hooters.\n\nIf I sound sarcastic toward Mormons, don't get me wrong. I've had Mormon co-workers and even a Mormon boss. I would jump at a chance to work with them again. Fine people as a rule.
