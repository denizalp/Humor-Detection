Overdue review! I was traveling through Phoenix on business in November when I had a dental emergency (crown came out!). I ended up calling a few local dentists and Dr. Aswad was the only one that agreed to see me right away and fix the problem. I ended up going into the office that afternoon and by the time my business dinner came around my tooth was fixed. No pain whatsoever.\n\nAs a plus the the office was brand new and super clean... the only downside to this place is that its in Phoenix... we need more offices like this in CA.
