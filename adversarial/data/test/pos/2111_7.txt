Like cheesesteak but are too lazy to drive to Philadelphia? This place should set you right! I used to go to their Yonge Street store (before it closed) pretty often and was always satisfied. Their Eglinton location is just as good! I night recommend The Works. Place is nothing fancy but the food is great!
