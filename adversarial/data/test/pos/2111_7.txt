Dogwood is owned by the same people as Dressler's. The idea behind this restaurant is \"Elevated Southern Food\". My dinner group met here to celebrate the group's 6th anniversary.\n\nFirst off, the decor is beautiful with reclaimed wood, a couple of fireplaces and wood beams. Tables in the dining room seemed to be right on top of each other. And the place was LOUD with nothing to eat the noise so you could barely hear the person across the table from you.\n\nThe drink menu is provided on an iPad for your viewing. They seem to have an extensive wine and whiskey list. The beer list consists of local and regional beers. I started the non-alcoholic thing recently and they have a few non-alcoholic drinks including a house made ginger beer which is what I ordered. It was spicy but delicious and not too sweet.\n\nAlmost everyone at our table ordered some sort of appetizer or salad. I ordered their market salad which was described as greens with a mixture of root vegetables and a spicy dressing. The problem here is that half our table (we had 11 people) received their appetizers and then the rest of the table waited approximately 15 minutes for theirs. The salad was good but the pieces of root vegetables were tiny.\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the Trout. Around the table, shrimp and grits and the Ribeye were popular. The trout was good with a nice skin and presented on a bed of rice grits but the grits lacked flavor. I was able to sample my neighbors ribeye and that was delicious with great flavor and very tender.\n\nMost of us ordered dessert. The carrot cake was really good. I ordered the NY cheesecake and while it was good and creamy I thought it could have been a bit more on the firm side.\n\nFor service, our server was amazing. She kept up with everything.\n\nThe noise level is what killed this experience for me and the appetizer timing issue. But the food has some highs and lows and you never know until you try a place out.
