Ever since I saw this place featured on Guy Fieri's hit show \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" I had to try their Oxtail Fries. Oxtail Fries looks better than it taste which was a little disappointing, but I will come back again for their Truffle Fries and Salted Caramel Shake. \n\nSERVICE\nFriendly and prompt. Service was on point.\n\nFOOD\nEverything was ordered by my self-proclaimed food critic friend. Here's what we got:\n\nShogun Burger: Consist of wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and yamamomo peach. $26 for a burger might scare some away but I personally liked this a lot. Asked the beef to be cooked medium rare and it was perfect as it could be, so tender and juicy. My main gripe about this burger was the unagi being too fishy. I would have enjoyed this more without unagi.\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries: Wow, flavor on fleek. Black truffle porcini cream drizzed on the fries had me asking, \"Can fries be this tasty?\" Apparently, it is possible.  Must get this if you are coming to Bachi Burger. \n\nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries: As seen on TV. It can get spicy because of chili and jalapeno. I personally enjoyed Truffle Parmesan Fries more.\n\nSalted Caramel Shake: Screw Starbucks and their caramel frap. Salted caramel shake with marshmallow here was next level. Perfectly sweetened with caramel and icy texture was super refreshing for me. \n\nCONCLUSION\nUnique and tasty burgers\/fries and good service. Can be on the pricier side because of high quality ingredients but worth it in my opinion.
