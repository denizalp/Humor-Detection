My friend and I got stopped by some guy (Josh?) on the street who worked at HAZE and told us he could get us free entry and free drinks etc...so we turned up (mainly because he told us 'he was a big deal' and we felt a bit sorry for him. I had no idea anyone used that phrase in real life). Got in free but the free drinks turned out to be a massive LIE. We kept getting told to go to the promoter's table to get drink vouchers (only to be told by a sympathetic bouncer that that we'd been fleeced and there was no such thing). Eventually we were told that all the drinks vouchers were gone and we should have got there ridiculously early (which was not pointed out to us - obviously). So I thought I'd get some water - err...should have read Yelp beforehand - $8??!?? HOW MUCH??? Did you have to go to Fiji to get that tiny little bottle???\n\nDancefloor was tiny and cramped, kinda lame music...Luckily we ran into some cool people and took the party somewhere else (that's a whole other story).\n\nI guess this is just how Vegas is. The moral of the story is either get there very very early or apparently dress in very small outfits so men will buy you drinks and grope your bum. Neither of which sound appealing to me...
