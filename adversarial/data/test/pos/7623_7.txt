Luci's is like one of those annoying \"slash\" bands; you know, rock\/ska\/gregorian chant\/fusion kind of thing.  Even if there's something you like, there's all that other stuff to contend with.\nThis place is a slick bastard child Mini-Me of a Trader Joe's meets Fresh & Easy meets Starbuck's meets CircleK, etc,etc,etc.\nThink of an item you can buy at one of those stores, add 50-100% to the price, reduce the selection to usually only one (or very few) choice(s), and voila!    ~ Luci's.\nEverywhere I looked I saw something I liked, tempered with something that made me take a step back.  Usually it was price.  Second most often it was selection.\n...then I got to the case with meats and cheeses and found prepackaged (excessively packaged,btw, way to be NOT green) slices of proscuitto or something similar that were way out of date - 6 days past the printed USE BY (not sell by) date.  For a store this small, to have more than a half dozen of these packages out in prominent view is not okay.  At least pull a F&E and let the clearance hounds take them for a bargain when they're about to be past due, but don't just keep trying to sell them for full price.\nThey make some fresh lemonade and teas, then put them into individual 20 oz\/32 oz plastic cups and leave them in the fridge case.  Fine during a lunch hour rush, but for me to have seen a full case of 'em at 9pm-ish meant they were about to throw it all away (either that or save it for the next day?).  This is not only wasteful of food and plastic packaging, but also drives their costs up.\nThis feels like an expensive imitation of the real deal, like an \"authentic\" NY deli or St Louis BBQ being dropped into Kierland Commons by  PepsiCo\/KFC\/PizzaHut\/TacoBell, or when a Vintage (glorified thrift) shop opens up in an artsyfartsy or ritzy area and starts charging Vintage prices for stuff they got at Goodwill's 50% off sale the week before.\nAlthough I'm sure that's not where Luci's in getting their food.  It might not be $6.99 for a $2.99 box of cereal if they were.
