I've enjoyed my three visits, however, my last visit in December was pretty terrible.\n\nIt feels like a real cafe: inviting furniture, the robust aroma of coffee beans, the wizzing, hissing, and grinding of various cafe machinery. It's a beautiful thing. Really great place to hang out or take a break from shopping.\n\nI'm not a huge coffee drinker, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. I've gotten the Nutella Cappuccino twice and the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well. I love the real mugs and the foam art. Plus, both drinks were tasty. Delicious coffee + cool cafe = wonderful experience.\n\nI was told that Leoné Café served pastries from Patisserie Manon, which came highly recommended, so I was excited to check out their case. I tried the Fraisier (French cake filled with strawberries and crème pâtissière) during my first visit and it was so heavenly! Very delicate cake with delicious cream and strawberries. \n\nIn December, the selection was not as nice. Actually, the quality seemed significantly lower. The \"fresh\" fruit topping the cakes were disgusting. It was obviously old and shouldn't have been in the case nor on sale. The pastries didn't seem to be of the same caliber as Patisserie Manon. Anyway, after terrible communication, obvious lack of focus, and substandard customer service from the 2-3 employees behind the counter, we chose the Chocolate Strawberry Cake and Carrot Cake along with our coffees. Both were dry and just bad.\n\nI'm giving them three stars because as a coffee shop, it's really great. Just avoid the pastries!
