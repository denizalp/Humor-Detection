Avoid this place if you can.  Based on my several experiences now:\n\n1) Ski shop people do not know what they are doing and cannot fix most brands of bindings\n2) They sell a ton of cupon books on group buying sites that they will not honour or are very restrictive AFTER you buy first\n3) Lessons are really bad\n4) The \"resort\" basically offers nothing but dirty washrooms, poor customer service and absolutely no security \n\nThe entire place has a total \"who cares\" attitude.  I hope they get bought out and the management changes soon.
