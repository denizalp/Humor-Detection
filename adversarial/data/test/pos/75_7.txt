MAD PROPS to CLubhouse for being one of the only like two all ages venues in the metro area. I absolutely love playing here and its a blast seeing shows here.\n\nThere are a few downsides that prevent me from making it a 5 such as the new sound guy and the grungy bathrooms, but overall this place is dizope!
