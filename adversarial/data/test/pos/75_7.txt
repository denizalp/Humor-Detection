I'm a huge fan of this place.. mostly because i'm from california and there we dont have indoor swat meets like this one.. especially ones that have carpets, a candy man or an exotic pet vendor. that impressed me. they accept cash only so be prepared, no refunds on products too\n\nPros;\n\n- the candy man! he has roasted almoonds, chocolate covered candys of all sorts and cool mixtures his wife makes. i def come here just to get the candy\n\n- the asian lady who sells beef jerky and all different kinds of jerky. delish! giving samples is also a win! I brought my family from las vegas\n\n- also a fan of all the different vendors.. such as the video games, as seen on tv, the new kinky store, the knifes, and the baby vendor with tons of cute dresses.\n\ncons;\n\n- the creepy creepster who works at the gypsy vendor where they sell like body dancing outfits. he was basically undressing my niece (whos 10) and me (21) wayyyy inappropriate! we wanted to yell, stranger danger.\n\n- the place looks pretty ghetto, including the outside. the inside has parts of the ceiling falling down, leaks which rain pours in, dirty stained carpet, food places that look dirtier than food trucks & lastly the outside has pink and blue artistry, in which it looks like a 5 years old painted. that should say enough.\n\noverall its only a dollar to get in, 50 cents for elderly & children and if you have nothing better to do on a saturday and sunday this is the place to be.
