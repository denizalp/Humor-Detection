There was a LIVE cockroach in our food.. there's a first for everything but a squirming cockroach nesting itself in a plate of rare beef should never be one.\n\nWhen we notified the staff with horrified faces he literally took a glance and just wisped the plate away with no explanation only to come back 5 mins later with a replacement plate of beef.. really?\n\nThe worst part about this experience was that there was absolutely no apology and their attitude that zero fs were given. I think what's more appalling than their questionable food safety standards was their poor service and lack of professionalism in dealing with this situation. \n\nNeedless to say I am never coming back.
