Great hike if you want something scenic and not too strenuous.  I was here again yesterday and there were actually some water pools from last week's rain. There are spots on the trail that involve climbing over rocks and up stone stairs as well as some narrow areas where you really have to hug the rock walls lest you fall but those are the only two challenges that I'd warn you about. If you make it to the end, you'll be rewarded with pretty views of the Vegas valley, including the Strip. Set aside about two hours to do the whole thing without rushing, which includes time to enjoy the views and have a snack. #LeaveNoTrace
