Rugged Warehouse is like a drug. I know drugs are bad for you, but this one just makes you feel OH so good. It takes your time, and your money from your pockets, but it's totally worth it. I'm starting to wonder if they have a Rugged Warehouse Anonymous in the back room or something as I watch the other wide eyed shoppers digging through the merchandise racks. \n\nI went to the salon next door and happened to randomly see this place on the same day. They had some cute clothes hanging outside and it was like they were beckoning me to walk inside. The large windows flashed shiny earrings and bangles at me, with purses and body wash gift packs next to it and scarves. My brain was on overload... new hair AND inexpensive new clothes\/accesories?? UM, YES PLEASE.\n\nI've been here 3 or 4 times and still don't think I've spent over $100 for all my combined visits. I've gotten shoes for $7, wallets for $4, earrings for $3 and bags of clothes for super cheap!! Now, I'm not saying it's all great, but enough of it is that I can say, I'm\"m an addict, and I'm not even ashamed to say so. \n\nI've purchased brands from the Limited, Forever 21, Kenneth Cole, Guess etc. They have something for all occasions... working out? No problem! Work? Gotcha covered! Hootchie club wear that shows off the girls?? YUUUUP. Seriously there is something for everyone here!\n\nThey even have men's, children's and plus sized clothing. Need to decorate your house, find a new bra and some undies, or some sun glasses? Then you NEED to go to the Rugged Warehouse. Seriously, GO. \n\nI'm going to stop writing this review just so you'll go, right now... even if they are closed. Sit outside and listen to 80's mix tapes in your car until they open the doors tomorrow morning! Ok now it's just getting weird, I'm done... but go.
