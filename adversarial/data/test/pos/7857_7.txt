i have been coming here since i was a little girl. Dr Timpson is the best. hes so gentle and kind. makes going to the dentist a little less sucky :) very reasonable for people with out insurance. 65 bucks for a whole teeth cleaning with Xrays! the office and rooms are very clean and stylish. theres even a personal TV in every room, and you have access to a remote so you can feel a little more comfortable even if your mouth hurts. Tammy at the front is a total sweetheart and very accommodating. I highly reccommend this dentist office.
