The Floridino's on Alma School is not connected to this restaurant in any way.  The owners of Floridino's in Chandler opened this location back in 2000, but they sold it over ten years ago, and it has sold a few times since then.  The food and menu are different, and the current owners have NEVER trained as a franchise or paid for a franchise, and unfortunately the Chandler Floridino's ends up looking like they are the same company, because the owner in Gilbert is using the name due to a technical loop hole in the paperwork, but it is not only shady business practice to do this, it also hurts the reputation of the owners of the Chandler location who have worked for over 15 years to build their business to the success it is.
