This is my Subway of choice when on my lunch break at work. The only reasons I can justify writing a review for a chain that offers such unfaltering consistency are two-fold: 1. The service is always good; and 2. I really want to be the first to review a restaurant. So here it goes:\n\nThe service has always been good. The sandwich artist are always generous with the veggies and as generous as they can be with the proteins. Considering this location is in a Wal-Mart (and I cannot imagine the ignorance these guys deal with), I'm grateful that they don't smack me in the face when I ask for a side of something.\n\nNow gimmie that star!
