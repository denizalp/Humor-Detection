Honestly, I still can't believe this happened to me and Tom, my boyfriend of nearly 10 years.  I suffer from MdDS and do not get a chance to leave the house often, nevertheless take a Vegas vacation.  I didn't spend a fortune on the rooms but there are certain things you do expect.  First, our original room was on the 31st floor.  Very high for Downtown Vegas.  You could hear the concerts on Freemont Street until 3 in the morning with bass thumping, window shaking sounds that nobody could sleep through.  In the early morning hours, construction resumed in a nearby room.  Sanding, drilling, hammering all being done with absolutely no reprieve.  Just as you can try to sleep, they start up the machinery.  You would think that would be a bad enough complaint for customer relations to care.  Oh, not even close.  \nWe changed rooms but did not have a chance to stay the second night as my boyfriend was banned from the hotel.  As I explained in my letter to the owner and the general manager, (not on property at the time), I was very unwell at one point the second day.  Tom and I had to separate so I could make myself up to the room as he went to buy a stomach settling Coke.  Worried about me, he was rushing and panicking.  He suffers from PTSD which I also included in my letter.  He found a wallet where he bought the Coke.  He went up to our room, checked on me, and then turned the wallet over to security.  A few minutes later, security put him handcuffs and whisked away from the roulette table.  They didn't ask him to come with them to answer questions.  They simply handcuffed in front of me and the table.  They left him in handcuffs on a wood bench for 30 minutes.  He had not stolen one thing.  The owner of the wallet was over the moon that the wallet was found and nothing was missing.  The hotel banned my boyfriend and as a result I was forced to leave as I cannot manage without help.  The front desk person even laughed at me regarding this.  Then, I wished to pay cash for the rooms and he didn't bother to ask and just charged it all to my credit card.  \nNow, if I was the owner, Derek Stevens or the lying risk manager, Brian Swartwood, I would have tried to please to the customer.  First, I was told they would look into things and get back to me by the end of the week or Monday of the following.  No call.  Tuesday I called twice and left messages and they were not returned.  In the end I received a heartless letter stating, they did nothing wrong, they don't care that there was no sleep and that my credit card was charged.  I was so incredibly nice the first time they called.  There was no reason for lying and treating a customer like they don't matter at all.  I thought my well-crafted letter would be met with customer service.  That is not available at The D and I would guess any other Derek Stevens properties.  Customers don't matter.  Being happy doesn't matter.  They honestly believe you are lucky to get to stay with these charmers. LOL
