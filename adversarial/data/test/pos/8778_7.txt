\"YES, YES...I am very happy to be here,\" is how I feel whenever I roll into the HHM. (Either this one or the Independence location.)  I kid you not, I have to restrain myself from running up to the bulk food dispensers and kissing them. \n\nHere's the backstory: I don't live in Charlotte but my family does. I'm a lil granola, crunchy, or treehuggy, if you will. Whenever I would suggest an herb, shampoo or vinegar with the mother to one of my family members here, they wouldn't know where to pick up such a thing. Also, whenever I came to town, it was hard for me to find my essential must have \"good stuff of the moment\": currently coconut water, cacao,  brazil nuts, nori snacks, and my mainstay Dr. Bonner's castile soap.\n\nEnter HHM: A friend of the family brought me here about a year ago and all was right with the world!\n\nThis place is small, yes, but somehow they still manage to have it all. The bulk section is pretty durn impressive, with grains, nuts, herbs, etc...even candy. The face & body products are top notch...you can even get Dr. Bonner's liquid soaps and many oils by the ounce. \n\nLooks like this location has a bar\/area where you can get smoothies, maybe even juice. I saw a Blendtec, but not a juicer. The coffee bar\/area sold Counter Culture Coffee. HHM is locally owned and sells local and organic products too.\n\nIn short, this place is an oasis in the desert.
