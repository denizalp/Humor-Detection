Sup homies and Asians (you Asian and you readin this and you know it) \n\nWell lemme hold it down for ya and go easy on me cuzz. And shout out P.I.M.P squad. Momma I luhhh u. \n\nNormally a brotha like me don't goto these kinds of places but homeboy called us out and we respectfully accepted. Now listen when a group of your Asian friends brings you some place suspect they know and all of them order something you've never heard of before..  Trust them more than your choice \n\nI was the odd one out that didn't get the pad Thai. I decided to go with the Curry rice with chicken.. \n\nHere's where da horror begun bruh. I open up this little box that cost 10 bucks and was like lol wut.. The pad Thai filled up the box to the top but with my Curry rice the chicken took up half the box and half with rice. \n\nSoo I unno bout y'all but I know what Curry is and all but I seen some liquidy ass milky rice that tasted sweet..  I ain't even know what I ate. On a suss note the chicken was good lol. \n\nNow I gave this an extra star because we came during closing and he offered me free rice which I gladly accepted because I wasn't close to full. So daps to the homeboy there. \n\nNow next time ima go wit the Asians brothas and roll with pad Thai but if you brown and you think this is some Indian typa Curry rice..  Bruhhhh; you ain't know the feel. This ain't a feel you wanna feel.
