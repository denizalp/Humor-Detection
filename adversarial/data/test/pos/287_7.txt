Joined here a few weeks ago, and so far  its great,  never  busy when i go,  use to be a cosco member  and never went cause it was always packed. Here you can  shop and  get around the store and not have people in your way.  Staff is friendly and helpfull.   And the checkout lines are great so far never had to wait on line.  I tryen a few of there prepared food  dishes and they were  great.
