Don't be intimidated by the front door or the dark atmosphere when you first step in. I know I was on my first visit.  \n\nI remember walking in and feeling like everyone had stopped what they were doing and turned around to see who the non-belonger was standing alone at the entrance. But that was all in my imagination, I think.\n\nI have since become a regular algebra-goer, coming here at least once a week for my fill of delicious coffee, tea, and authentic Mediterranean food\n\nOwned and built by a Case alum, this gem of a tea house really delivers on uniqueness, authenticity, and atmosphere. With their one of a kind handmade tables, cups, wooden plates, artwork, they really leave their mark as one of the coolest coffee houses in Cleveland\n\nYou really can't go wrong with any of their food, I am a big fan of their falafel and shawarma. Their hummus is also very good, but a little tame for me, I like my hummus more offensive with more lemon and a tad more garlic, but that's just a preference thing. Algebra is also very vegan friendly and has a large assortment of healthy menu options. Isn't it a great feeling to finish a big meal and still feel healthy afterwards?\n\nTheir drinks are not for the average venti-mocha-frappuccino-with-extra-whipped-cream 'coffee' sippers. As is the food, the drinks are authentic and are generally not too sweet, if at all. \n\nIf you are unsure of what to order, I recommend the chai tea and perhaps the falafel sandwich as starters\n\nMy only gripe with this place is that they aren't too consistent because they have a different person working there almost everyday, all of whom have their own slight variations on food and drink prep, so if you liked the chai tea you had Monday morning, you might not like it as much Wednesday night.\n\nBut this place delivers on so many other aspects, that I can't bring myself to give them anything below a 'as good as it gets'\nSo come check this place out, order an iced chai tea with falafel sandwich, you won't be disappointed!\n\nAnd remember, on your way out, it's push not pull :)
