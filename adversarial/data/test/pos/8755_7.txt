Lovely little restaurant, lovely little surprise.  What a nice way to have lunch after a day of exploring out west.  Although small and in a strip mall, once inside you are in a charming red \"bistroish \"  cafe. The style is warm and the food is delicious. \n\nI  highly recommend the Lamb Panini  super good, moist  and flavorful. \nThe Fish And Chips special was tasty too. The fish and fries both appeared to be beer battered .  Generous portions and great taste. Can't wait to go back.
