I hate myself when I come here. The loukoumades...I fantasize bathing myself in these...don't forget the cinnamon!!!\n\nWARNING: need tissues and\/ or wet naps when eating these scrumptious little balls of calories. (Urgh...I hate cardio.) Parents...your children will not come out of this clean if left unsupervised consuming these...
