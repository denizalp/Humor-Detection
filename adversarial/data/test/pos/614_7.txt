I'm not a fan of buffets. Trays of food being 'tampered' with freaks me out! I haven't been to a buffet in ages -- at least not the last 3 times we've been to Vegas, but this time, I had a craving for peel and eat shrimp. I don't eat much else at a buffet, so I said let's go to the Orleans for their buffet since it's really cheap and I know they have peel and eat shrimp.\n\nOK so the pricing was super cheap -- it's $7.49 for lunch -- and it includes non-alcoholic beverages. There were the usual bbq stuff, Mexican stuff, Chinese stuff, Italian stuff, and an attempt at Mongolian bbq, which was rather dismal. \n\nI had about a pound and of a half of shrimp, a few slivers of bacon, 3 corn on the cob, a swirl of vanilla ice cream with crushed peanuts, 3 glasses of iced tea and I was done. I remembered last time they had these fantastic cookies, but there wasn't a cookie in sight. On top of that they have added a gelato station, but all the desserts were handed out, you couldn't help yourself to them.\n\nFor me, this buffet suffices because I don't really eat much at a buffet. Usually, I'll eat peel and eat shrimp, smoked salmon or trout, and lamb chops if they have them. What's the point of paying 20 bucks when that's all I eat? \n\nThe buffet at the Orleans is fine by me. It has the shrimp, and I'm happy to pay $7.50 for it! I must say I remember there to be more selections so I have to deduct a star for this visit. However, I didn't feel ripped off and I was content when I stood up to leave.\n\nPS: If you are my kind of buffet eater -- check out my review of the buffet at Palace Station -- I thought it was better than this one and for almost the same price!
