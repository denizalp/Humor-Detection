The view of the Valley from the foot of South Mountain?  Check.  Now here's the rest of the story.\n\nIt was our first visit there and over an hour wait was what it took before my wife and I were seated.  I knew it'd be a bit of an old western type place when we parked in the overly rocky, dirt lot, carefully attempting to avoid the scuffs and scratches that would surely follow if we bumped into the cholla and other desert vegetation I didn't want to run over while backing up to the edge of the dry riverbed cutting across that section of the lot.  I should've known better though when we introduced ourselves at the front door -- the tables were adorned with red and white plaid plastic tablecovers and the front facade of the building was clad with barn wood circa 1800-and-something.  I thought to myself, \"ok, well, even though I've never heard of this place before, it popped up on 'google's review of steakhouses in Phoenix; it looks like we might be trying a place that rivals one or two of the other well known steakhouses in the Valley.  After all, there are a couple of others that have been around for 30+ years and they're pretty good, too.\"  Well, after placing our order, nearly 45 more minutes passed before our meals were served -- the Filet Mignon and a New York Strip.  We never learned the name of our waitress, but I guess that's because she was \"busy\".  She definitely mentioned that to us.   When dinner was ready, each of the steaks were neatly plopped on a plain, scratched white plate, literally, without an ounce of anything else to accompany them, no, not even a parsley snip.  Just a plain, boring piece of meat all alone on that plate.  My first reaction was - \"is that it?  Is that  what we're about to eat?\"  I sat there, looked at it for a moment and then looked up at my wife in silence.  I didn't see the mystery server, but from somewhere behind me, I heard, \"I'll be back with your beans and bread in a minute\".  Sure enough, the beans arrived with the bread, but by then, we weren't sure we even wanted them.  The steaks were mediocre at best -- the filet being WAY over cooked.  The beans you ask, well, let's just say that I wondered if we had been called to the back of the chow wagon by cookie because lemme tell ya, it must've taken a lot to open that last can of beans marked \"best if used by February, 1842.  Oh, and by the way, yeah -- that bread.  I never knew they sleeved the loaves in cheap plastic bags back then.  The bread tasted like the plastic it had been stored in and the frozen butter my wife tried to use, well, I didn't have the heart to dash her hopes of trying one last time to make something of the meal.  I don't know anyone who would voluntarily opt for torn, plastic bread with a hint of butter instead of a nice, warn, homemade roll, or something.  I guess that would've cost more than our $50 would cover.  PS:  If you're looking forward to starting your experience at T-bone steakhouse with a nice salad, don't get your hopes up too high.  Be prepared to serve yourself, but only a leaf or two from the wooden bowl over ice.   That was the weakest excuse for a salad bar I've ever seen, ever.   P.A.T.H.E.T.I.C !
