This might be the biggest dive golf course on the planet, which most certainly adds to its charm.  Cheap, not crowded, absolutely no frills, but a great place for a beginner to learn how to play golf and have fun.  Proper golf attire NOT required.  I'm not even sure if they require shirt and shoes.  Great place to go with your friends and hack around on the golf course over a few drinks.  Dewey who works the register may be old & miserable, but his bitter facade only hides the man's heart of pure gold.
