I could have slept in but wanting to spend time with GF I opted to go out and about with her and this was the first leg of the trip.  So many cool little things to look at and and or purchase.  Whicker this and ceramic or glass that, it reminded me of a Pier 1 Import, only I don't remember P1I selling booze, old school soda or toy accordions.  We met Andrew and Mike and found these two cats to be very helpful.  Their sheer amicability is enough to warrant a future visit.  We ended up leaving with a six pack of pumpkin larger but all the more....we left with happy feelings and talking about our return trip!
