I love edgy........Charlotte is not edgy.  I love loud.........Charlotte is not loud.  I love emerging bands and the music they play.......Charlotte is not an up and coming music scene........\n\nWhat Charlotte does have is Snug Harbor.  Though I haven't a clue about what the names means.........I'm sure all the hipsters out there reading this are happy I don't know because I'm an old geezer that just doesn't........nor shouldn't........get it, but the place rocks.  I mean literally.\n\nI come to this place because a band from my hometown (Asheville) plays here a few times a year and the experience just cannot be beat.  Forget the music, the people watching alone is worth a cover.\n\nIt is funny as I know some folks that just live a block away and they NEVER come here, so where these folks come from I haven't a clue but they make the place.\n\nI mean you have your bearded hipsters with the tight skinny jeans, flannel cowboy shirts and ski skull caps (even in summer) and chuck Taylors........then you have your Goth girls with jet black hair and enough make up to still get them kick out of their parents house.......even at 29...wearing tight skinny jeans, flannel cowboy shirts and ski skull caps (even in summer) and chuck Taylors...then you have the long hair hippies with the tight skinny jeans, flannel cowboy shirts and ski skull caps (even in summer) and chuck Taylors and the ol' school artist with the snow white hair ,tight skinny jeans, flannel cowboy shirts and ski skull caps (even in summer) and chuck Taylors.  I mean the place is as diverse as it gets.\n\n24 oz BPRs (that must be a silent shout out to Todd somehow) and a nice beer selection, plus they pour liquor faster than you can say \"quicker!\"\n\nThe space is small, so if you do want to see a show I recommend getting there early as there is very little seating either at the bar or at the few booths.\n\nBathrooms......well, I'll just leave that up to you to find out about\nIn all seriousness, I have some great memories of this place and feel this is a true gem of a bar in this town.
