I wanted to like this place as my mom ranted and raved about it after her friends took her here for her birthday but after waiting 3 hours for the crispy pata that never came we were very disappointed. Maybe things have changed since this was a few months ago. The halo halo we ordered was covered in so much ice that it should have just been a snow cone.  There was hardly any goodies in it and a total disappointment especially since we were already disappointed by the crispy pata.  The two stars is for the binagoogan fried rice (sp?).  Now that was off the chains and I do give her props for that. I will just stick to my side of town...
