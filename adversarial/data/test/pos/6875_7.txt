I chose this place because I'm moving into my condo and saw and read good reviews about deep cleaning. I have not seen what kind of job they did because my fianc√© met them to pay them but I did not like when I met them to let them in. One lady was carrying a ladder and scraped my new painted wall with the bottom of it and then set her cleaning supplies on a bed with no sheets on it. I was also trying to speak to them about exactly what I wanted done but they kept speaking to each other and ignored me at first. I hope when I see it they at least did a good job.
