Wow. I went here due to a recommendation from a friend, and I was blown away. I was personally seen to by the owner himself, and he was fabulous. I was made to feel like a princess. (Gentlemen, if you're not looking for princess treatment, you will still get amazing service.)\n\nIt is relevant for me to state that I have some looong hair. My numerous past foil experiences led me to believe that 5+ hours was the normal allotted time period for having my glorious mane washed, coloured, and trimmed to perfection. Well, lemme tell you: That man had me outta there within 3 hours. I would like to add that at no point did I feel like he was rushing; he was simply quick and efficient.\n\n\"Well, Stranger on the interwebs,\" you might be saying, \"If he got you out so quickly, your hair must have looked atrocious!\" So not the case! My hair looked, felt, and smelled beautiful.\n\nIt's obvious that this is what he loves to do, and he has the skill to back it up. It was the best hair experience that I recall ever having. The head massage alone is enough to make me return to this mystical place of perfect coiffure. The rest -- the timely colour, the professional cut, the welcoming attitude -- was icing on the cake.\n\n\"Oh, talkative Narrator,\" you may ask, \"A salon such as this must be very busy.\" True. So very true. This hair savant serviced many a person while I was there, but at no point did I feel neglected. It's a delicate dance of delegation to his workers and time management, and he pulled it off flawlessly.\n\n\"Miss Chatterbox,\" you could be thinking, \"That's all very nice, but what does it cost?\" A superb cut and colour can be pricey, but this was well below what I've paid at some salons. I believe a list of prices is available on the website. I ended up calling for my estimate.\n\nThanks for reading my novelette. I obviously have no lack of good things to say about this place. All I will say further is that you will be giving yourself a real treat if you see Sam at La Bella Salon.
