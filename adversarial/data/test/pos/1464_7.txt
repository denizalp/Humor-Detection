I'm upgrading. Not from this discount hair cutting place, but for my review of it. Two years later and Barb is still doing a fab job. So good, in fact, that I haven't had my hair cut since February and I keep getting people asking me if I've just changed my haircut because it looks so good!\n\nWhat you can expect: Fast haircuts, and to pay extra for services you might otherwise expect at a hair salon (like getting your hair washed). Understand too that just like anywhere, if you get someone you've never had before, they may very well give you a cut you don't like. It's happened to me before. But that's another bonus to Great Clips, they'll still let you request the stylist you want.\n\nThe other handy thing now about Great Clips is that, if you aren't waiting specifically for Barb (I'm sure they have other great stylists too), you can use their app to get a spot in line without having to sit there for 20 minutes wondering when you'll be next. Don't you love the internet?\n\nKeep me lookin' fab, and I'll keep coming back.
