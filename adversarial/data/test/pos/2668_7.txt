Well spank my bum and call it tidy, just finished the Total Cleanse 3 day Refresh Cleanse (http:\/\/www.totalcleanse.ca\/cleanses\/refresh-cleanse\/) and I'm feeling squeaky clean. \n\nI was a tad dubious about the whole \"juice cleanse\" thing and how effective they were, but sitting here on the morning after 3 full days surviving solely on fresh pressed juice I've got a host of observations and comments that I think are worth noting.\n\nI had previously summarized these in a talk thread that ironically came about while I was on this cleanse so I'll pull from that: \n\n1) Day 1 and 2 were difficult, I noticed my energy levels were low, and I had regular headaches (I might attribute this to having no caffeine, something I ingest 1-2 times daily)\n\n2) Day 1 and 2 my concentration levels were way off, I couldn't do much more than watch Netflix\n\n3) I've lost 5-6 pounds in two days, and I imagine that I'll lose another 2.5-3 by the end of today\n\n4) Reliance on caffeine by day 3 (today) is diminished. I was able to get up a lot easier and with no headache or grogginess (I can't fully attribute this to the cleanse as I noticed the same response in my body when I went cold turkey on caffeine back in September)\n\n5) No headache today\n\n6) Drinking a juice every 2 hours is the exact timing my body required to maintain itself. The cleans I am on contains about 1100-1200 calories per day, enough to sustain but likely 1\/3 the calories I typically ingest in my day to day \"yelp diet\" ha ha\n\n7) I HATED the green energy juice that I must endure 3 times a day, but it's essential so I did my best to get it down\n\n8) Post cleanse I'm craving healthier options today, (Egg white and oatmeal this morning for breaky)\n\n9) My taste buds are incredibly sharp this morning - Berries in my oatmeal were almost TOO sweet and normally I'm looking to add sugar or agave syrup\n\n10) You know what you had to endure to make it through this so I'm already planning a better, lower calorie, healthier meal plan moving forward.\n\nOverall I think it accomplished some goals for me personally and helped me to achieve a body reset I was looking for, however I cannot be 100% certain that some of this isn't coming from cutting certain elements from my diet.\n\nGreencrest Out!\n\nNB: This cleanse will cost approx. $52\/day with delivery + tax, they regularly offer promotions and I was able to take advantage of a 15% holiday season discount.
