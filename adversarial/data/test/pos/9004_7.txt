In my humble opinion, I think that Hankang is the best Korean place in Calgary,  I haven't seen much but I've been to other places and they just don't add up.  Hankang is a small restaurant located across from Sir Winston Churchill High School.   Its definitley a hidden gem.. you wouldn't notice the place until someone pointed it out but when you discover this place you just want to keep going back!  \n\nWhenever I go, I get the Shortribs.  SOOO TASTY!  The combo comes with a small miso soup to start, shortribs on a hot plate, and about 5 sides..marinated bean sprouts, potatoes, zuchinni, kimchi and their seasonal vegetable along with rice!  The shortribs are tasty and hot, marinated well and all the sides are great.  My favorite side is the garlic potatoes!   They're nice and crispy, covered in garlic sauce and they're AMAZING.  I usually get a container of potatoes to bring home for a snack.  The shortrib combo is about 17-18 dollars and can feed two!\n\nAnd the best thing?  They have a lunch special from Monday to Friday from 11:30am to 2:30pm.  The lunch special has a selection of shortribs, chicken or pork.  Each plate comes with a generous amount of selected meat, rice, salad, potatoes, bean sprouts and two spring rolls....ALL on the one plate!  May seem a little squishy...and it is!! But the plate clears fast! :)  The lunch special is a whopping ~$10!\n\nDefinitley worth it!
