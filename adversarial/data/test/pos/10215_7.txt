Executive Summary: We had dinner last night and it was our worst dining experience in the Phoenix area in decades.  I wouldn't want to go here again even if I had to pay to not go.\n\nLocation: Excellent.  Atmosphere: Live music in lounge, but far too loud.  Patio dining looked very nice but was too cold for us that evening.  The dining room was OK, but nothing special.  Lucky for us we couldn't hear this music from where we were seated in the dining room.  Food: Sub-standard for a place with these prices, actually just plain sub-standard.  The menu was disappointing.  If you want good food, there are several dozen excellent places to choose from within five minutes of this location - go someplace else.  Service: The worst we've ever experienced in Phoenix, from top to bottom.\n\nService was abysmal.  The only drinks my wife and I ever received were those we ordered in the lounge area where we met another couple.  I ordered a martini when we initially sat down which never came.  We were having a difficult time getting anyone's attention.  After 30 minutes I gave up on the martini and since dinner was about to be served, ordered a glass of wine.  They served wine to others at my table and again forgot mine.  Finally halfway through dinner the original waiter showed up asking if I'd ever gotten my martini (mind you this was 45 minutes after I'd ordered it).  I told him to forget the martini and that I'd already ordered wine.  After reminding them once, my wine never did arrive.\n\nI had a Caprese Salad that was unlike any I've had in the past and I didn't like it, the presentation or taste.  Next our entrees arrived.  I had what they call \"Diver Scallops\" which again I didn't like.  The problem was that when they removed our salad dishes, they took our knives and never replaced them.  Once dinner was served we again couldn't get anyone's attention, so I used my butter knife to eat my scallops.  It was over halfway through our meal before 2 members of our party were able to finally flag someone down and get knifes for their meat dishes.\n\nWhen our entrees arrived they managed to place every entree in front of the wrong person.  Once we finished our meals I excused myself saying I was going to the restroom, but I really wanted to find someone to tell about this terrible experience.  The only people I found were two hostesses standing at the check-in across from the lounge.  There was very loud live music blasting so I raised my voice to tell them.  Mind you nobody other than these two hostesses heard me because this music was so loud; nobody looked up, nobody other than these two ladies could possibly hear me.  One of them responded \"What do you want me to do?  I'm not back there (meaning the dining room).  Why are you yelling at me?\"  I was speaking loud in order to be heard over the music.  My response was \"Oh, I thought you worked here.\"  She said, \"Why tell me.\"  I suggested that she might possibly tell the manager and added that I didn't want anything said at the table because we came here at the suggestion of the other couple at the table and I didn't want them to feel any more embarrassed than I knew they already were.  I found her attitude to be even worse than their already bad service.\n\nA few minutes later a manager came by to ask how things were and the couple with us pointed out the missed drinks and terrible service.  The manager asked \"What can I do to make things better.\"  I indicated he could get somebody to bring me some water.  Nobody had ever come to fill our water glasses and since everyone else at the table had been served drinks I was drinking only water and my glass had been empty for probably 20 minutes.  The manager went and got me water himself.\n\nNext we ordered coffee and dessert (a very good chocolate hazelnut cake).  The problem was it was almost impossible to get a refill on coffee.  The couple we were with asked three times for a refill and finally asked the person clearing plates from the table if they could get us coffee.  His response was \"who's your waiter?\" but he did get us coffee.  When we ordered coffee one person wanted cream and another sugar - naturally they put the cream and sugar in front of the wrong people on the opposite sides of the table.  They couldn't get anything right.\n\nThe odd thing was there were a lot of wait staff running around, it was just that nobody seemed to ultimately be \"responsible.\"  In total we believe we had 5 different folks at our table.  Yet the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing, thus the missed drinks and misplaced dishes.\n\nThe one positive note I can make is that \"AT LEAST THEY WERE CONSISTENT\" which is important for many businesses.\n\nI left my first sub-15% tip in decades.  I did this intentionally to make a statement.  My wife asked on the way home what gratuity I left and I learned she would have made a much stronger statement if she were leaving the gratuity, as in zero.
