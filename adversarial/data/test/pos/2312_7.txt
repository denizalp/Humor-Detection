Over the weekend my garage door broke wouldn't open I called another company they quoted 2300 to fix a simple spring so I found this company and boy let me tell you they were out super fast to give an estimate and it came in at 50% lower than the other. The tech was extremely nice and very helpful. I am going recommend this company to all my neighbor's.  I was reading the reviews on this company and I really don't see why anyone would give them a bad review. Thanks Precision for the friendly service and fast response you made my weekend so much better knowing I could trust you and you not rip me off out of thousands of dollars.
