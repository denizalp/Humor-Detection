Al Decker and his family runs this tax stand.  I have used him since 1996, and I absolutely love their tax work.  He is aggressive at saving me money and this is why I am unable to switch back to be standard tax man, who seems to work for the IRS.  \n\nAl's main approach to taxes is 'DON'T GET AUDITED.\"  Although Al has been as bold as I have wanted him to be, he also tells you when you are creating a red flag, which is likely to get you audited, so listen to him.....\n\nIn spite of all the careful steps, I was audited in 2003 & 2004.  I was very nervous, thinking I was too aggressive and there would be huge fees and fines etc...  A phone call to Al's put me at ease.\n\nAl and his wife Cheryl walked me through the audit.  We gave the IRS what they wanted.  There was a discrepancy of a few $100s.  I paid it and that was it.  It was wrapped up within 48 hours.  The add'l money I paid was money I would have already paid if I went to H&R Block anyway.  I guarantee I am still ahead vs. standard tax approaches.\n\nIf you want to keep as much of your money as possible, I suggest Accountable Business Services.  Accountable Business Services is especially beneficial if you own your own business, have rental properties etc.....
