Clean shop and I get a great cut for $13.  For guys that's a steal.  I like trying new people and I don't mind getting a different person each time.  If you're picky you'll want to call ahead and ask for Stephanie or Kristie.  I've had them both several times and they are very consistent. \n\nGreat Clips is on the opposite side of the parking lot from Wal-Mart. Don't go over to Wal-Mart!  Steer over to Game Stop and it's in the same row of shops as Off Broadway Shoes and Party City.  Boom!\n\nDon't forget to tip. These nice ladies ain't workin' for smiles!
