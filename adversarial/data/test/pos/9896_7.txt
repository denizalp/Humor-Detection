I noticed an extremely foul odor in my room. It smelled like something was rotten or died. I searched for source, but I couldn't find it. I ran the water in the kitchen, and bathroom, flushed the toilet and turned on the garbage disposal to see if that would flush out the stench. I also held the door open for a while to try and air it out. \n\nI called the front desk to have them send somebody up. Instead of saying \"OK sir, we'll send somebody right up.\" they just abruptly transferred me to another number where nobody answered. Confused, I hung up and called back. I reexplained the issue, and then they assured me somebody would be on the way. \n\n3 men came up to fix the problem, I explained to them I tried and flush the place out. His solution was to prop the door open, pour a bottle of dish soap down the drain, turn on the garbage disposal and run the water. I guess. I was hoping for a candle or some air freshener. \n\nWhile I'm waiting for it to air out, I go next door to where the rest of my party was staying. I would have just switched rooms, but we had a large party of people and I wanted to be close to them. After a little while, I go back to the room to check on it, and it's still pretty bad. I decided to leave the door open while we leave to go down to use the gym.\n\nWhile down at the gym, I go over to the front desk and tell them that their solution wasn't working. The front desk girl informs me that security found my door open to my room, and they had closed it. I tell her, Yes, I know it was open, you're people opened it because it smelled like death. I ask them what can we do. They tell me the manager is busy, and I'll need to wait until the he's is back. I tell them I'll just be in the gym if they want to reach me, and go back to working out. \n\nAfter about an hour of being in the gym, I go up to the same front desk lady I had just talked to about the problem earlier. I give her a look like \"Hey uuummm sooooo any progress on our situation.\" She looks at me and  says, \"Hello, how can I help you?\"\n\nI awkwardly say, \"Hi, um I was just up here a minute ago, I was the guy who was having the smell in his room issue. I was wondering if you maybe talked to the manager, or there's been some further progress on the situation or something.\" \n\nShe looks at me, and says, \"So, what do you want to do?\"\n\nI give her a shoulder shrug and a confused look, and say \"I don't know.\"\n\nShe asks if I want to change rooms.I don't WANT to change rooms and it puts me in a different part of the hotel. But, I just wanted to fix the situation as quickly as possible. \n\nI did think it was weird that the manager never saw me, or that I didn't get an apology for my inconvenience from the front desk. Whatever, problem solved, I go back to my smelly room, grab all my luggage, and move it to my new room. \n\nThe next night, was awesome. We go out partying at Hard Rock with DJ Pauly D from Jersey Shore (fist pumpin' good time!) It's a late night with large amount of drinking. It's also daylight savings and The Tahiti Village has a check out time of 10am, I'll be suffering on the drive back to L.A., but it's Vegas baby!  \n\nSuddenly, the next morning, I wake up to the sound of the house keeping knocking on my door, I look at the clock it says 7:30am. I yell to the door, \"SLEEPING!\"  A few minutes later, they try calling me. I just ignore it. Another few minutes later, I hear them open the door, then realizing there's somebody in there, they close the door. \n\nAt this point I've had it. Out of my mind with anger, I call the front desk screaming obscenities about the cleaning crew waking me up. The front desk woman gets defensive and tells me not to talk to her like that. Somehow, I calm down and tell her I'm not cursing at her, but that I'm upset with the situation. I explain that that we were out all night partying, that the cleaning crew has waken me up several times and that I have to drive back to L.A. after a late night. \n\nShe tells me, yes, the cleaning crew isn't supposed to be coming into my room until 10am, and that it's unacceptable. She says I can have an extended checkout at 11am instead of 10. Gee thanks! Maybe they'll comp me a free lunch after I paralyze myself in a crash from falling asleep on the road. \n\nI dose off for a bit. A few minutes later, I hear somebody open the door, and then close it again. Another few minutes goes by, and the same thing happens. This is insane, even after I've called and screamed, they're still doing it! \nI avoid checking out of the hotel because I was so angry. I didn't want a confrontation, I just wanted to leave and get back to L.A. Luckily I didn't have to drive because we had enough people to cover the driving, but the whole ride home was miserable. Exhausted and hungover, sitting in traffic for hours and hours is terrible.
