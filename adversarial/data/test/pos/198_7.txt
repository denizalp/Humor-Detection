If you're looking for a spot to get wasted and potentially piss on the floor you're in business here.  I was surrounded by people in Jean jackets, female mullets and bandannas.  Cheap drinks and I got super drunk.  Kareoke is fun but the size of the place makes it impossible for me to do my moon walking or break dancing.
