My last trip here was very disappointing.  Where to begin?   It took a while for our server to show up.  Interesting side note: While waiting for our server we couldn't help but notice out of the 24 patrons in the restaurant 23 were female LOL!  The happy hour menu was okay but nothing too spectacular, select wines $5 or $7 dollars, select cocktails were I think $5, and some discounted apps, bruschetta $3.  \n\nWe ordered two cocktails and a bruschetta.  They didn't have the cucumber for the drink I selected so I had them modify it with raspberries...didn't have that either.  Anyway I ended up with an interesting gin drink, which worked because I was very thirsty at that point.  The bruschetta that was supposed to come out of the brick oven looked good BUT was cold.  I mean it was cooked in a brick oven , somebody probably changed their mind or whatever; it was then put it in a fridge to preserve it and failed to heat it up again, which was then served to us cold.  At that point we decided not to have dinner here and left to go somewhere else.  \n\nI am very disappointed, I loved this place when it opened!
