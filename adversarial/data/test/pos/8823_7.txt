Mom has been taking me to lunch once a week and today she took me here. Having just moved back to the valley after 9 years in the Midwest, I had no idea of the controversy that has gone on here.  We had a lovely lunch. Both Samy and Amy greeted us with a smile and I found them to be extremely courteous, friendly and pleasant.  While my mother noshed on the cauliflower soup (absolutely delicious!) I had a hard time selecting an entr√©e because they all sounded so fantastic. I finally opted for the spicy Asian salad - it was awesome! The cabbage, arugula,what I think was caramelized peanuts, cilantro etc. etc. but best of all the dressing! Not sure what's in there but it is definitely addicting!  seriously A salad that will tickle your taste buds. It was big enough to share but instead I took the other half home to eat later as I needed to save room for one of the most  Beautiful desserts I have ever seen.  The dessert case is truly a work of art. Amy is incredibly talented and it shows.  Funny thing is I typically don't like sweets however, the Keylime pie looked irresistible and it was! I would have taken a photo but I was too excited and gobbled it up.\n\nBottom line: I had a wonderful experience today and I will definitely be back with friends! thank you to Amy and Samy!!
