Terrible experience.  Signed up to join the gym. My job took me offshore for 6 months.  LA Boxing\/UFC would not work with me to cancel my contract.  I did not get to take one class.  Last payment I tried to get a refund, UFC sent my account to collections for $79 after I paid $869.  Such a shame.  I got such a run around trying to make a settlement.  They would not budge.  Free money, no service.  DON'T sign.
