Rolled part way across the valley to celebrate Boss's Day.  The Jefa is from the Netherlands after all, and this seemed a fitting end to a righteous lunch hour. \n\nLocated in my old stopping ground at the 2800 black of E. Tropicana there was a little bit of line as we negotiated our way across the west bound Trop traffic.  One in line in the drive-thru the wait went quickly.\n\nRolling up to the window we were met by one of peppiest coffee slingers it has ever been my pleasure to meet.  She was the very picture of hospitality and reminded me of the good old coffee house days.  We could have spent the better part of the afternoon getting to know her, but this would not have been fair to the vehicles idling and waiting for their orders behind us.\n\nThe coffee was on point and I hope of locations are to be opened up in the Vegas valley.
