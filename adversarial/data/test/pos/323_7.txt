Let it be known that I absolutely loved Marianne when I met her at the potluck last year, and I normally hate most people.  Her sugar free shaved ice was awesome.\n\nBut the reason why I'm giving her establishment three stars is simply because every single time I have tried to get some shaved ice, about 4 or 5 times, she hasn't been carrying the sugar free syrup.\n\nI am more than happy to bump this up when the sugar free syrup is back, but for now I'm very unhappy!
