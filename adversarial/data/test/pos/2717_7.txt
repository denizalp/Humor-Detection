I finally experienced Ross J's and all I have to say is \"WOW.\"\n\nI had been hearing rave reviews of this place for ages, but I'm always reluctant to venture out to that side of town, since it's quite a drive for me. Well, my opportunity arrived, Groupon offered an amazing deal, so I snatched it up. \n\nMy first attempt didn't go as planned. We drove all the way over there and decided to do a little shopping in the area before heading to Ross J's. Bad idea, who knew it closed so early. Darn, my first attempt squashed. Second attempt was on New Year's Day. Yes, I must've been the only person who forgot this is considered a holiday. This is Vegas, where nothing ever closes, so I sometimes forget holidays exist for other people. Second attempt was a fail.\n\nLuckily, my third attempt was a success and boy was it worth the drive. We ordered the Loco Moco, Spicy Korean Chicken and two Musubis (Spam and Chicken). It was so delicious and best of all CHEAP! For all we ordered and a soda, we paid less than $15. I can't sing the praises of this place enough!\n\nThe portions are ginormous and the food is great. I'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu items and probably get some more of that Spicy Korean Chicken. That was my favorite!
