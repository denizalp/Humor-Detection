Came here on Monday Night, with my workers and friends in mine that they decided to go for the first time in Las Vegas Lobster Experience and we ordered a New England Clam Chowder Homestyle, Crabcake Burger, Atlantic Blue Crab, Lobster Mac and Cheese, and Lobster Grilled Cheese. And also my favorite part of the Lobster ME was the Lobster Mac and cheese, because it was super good that I tried this before and it was the most Monday nights I've ever seen!
