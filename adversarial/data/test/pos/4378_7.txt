Stay away from this place. They'll gouge you. I have a 1949 Plymouth 2 Door Club Coupe & called to get an estimate on installing my vinyl on my inner window garnish moldings. I sent photos of them and told her (Maria) that I would remove them and drop them off. Also, keep in mind that i was furnishing my own vinyl\/wrap material. A few days later i got an email from Maria  with an estimate. This is her reply: \"looking at your project i would have to charge you by the hour ($85) it may take more then 8 hours. please let me know how to proceed\". According to my math, that comes to $680. That's ridiculous!!! a well established heart surgeon gets $90 per hour. There's not much effort involved because I did my dashboard with the same vinyl. It's just that due to my physical handicap (Vietnam Vet), I can not stand up for very long. I was able to do the dash because I had the front seat to sit on.\n\nP,S. By the time I contacted Maria, I had previously talked to another girl and gave her all the info but I never received a reply from her.
