In honor of the impending NYE celebrations that will be happening all across the Valley tonight, I thought it was only fitting to update my review for Clean Air Cab. Let this be a reminder to all you party animal elves tonight; don't drink and drive! Either stay close to home so you can walk home, pay a designated driver to stay sober or take a cab like Clean Air Cab! It's worth the wait, I promise. C.A.C is my favorite cab service because they are local, they are clean, they are friendly and they are speedy. Granted, if you call C.A.C. on a night like tonight, there will be a wait, but like I said, it's worth the wait to know you are getting into a safe cab that's authorized to drive people around. I'm especially talking to the ladies out there who will be taking a cab home after the bars. Stay safe and call Clean Air Cab.
