I agree with Jennifer K that this place lacks a certain energy - maybe it just feels too contrived in this neighborhood? \n\nI came here on a whim after lunch - wanted to have something sweet but absolutely none of the pastries seemed all that tempting. Everything looks clean and tidy, but the desserts seem nicer to look at than to eat. I settled on gelato - unfortunately this wasn't great either. Pistachio flavor wasn't good enough to finish and the coffee flavor was okay. Overall the texture was a bit runny with bits of ice, which is never good.\n\nI wanted to like this place more, but I don't think I'd return. As pretty as the decor is, I don't think I can satisfy a real craving for dessert here.
