This Vons is really interesting:\n-  cough syrup aisle is completely locked up; I guess too many people using it to get high\n-  not in the best of locations, pretty much in an abandoned strip mall\n-  all hard alcohol is locked away in protected cabinets, including the cheapies like Popov vodka\n-  interesting mixture of people here from party goers to homeless, but the service was very nice\n-  has a full time security guard\n\nWill get the job done in a pinch, but definitely goto other options if you have better options in the area.
