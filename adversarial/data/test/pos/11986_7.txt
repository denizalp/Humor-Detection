I've always been a fan of Pita Jungle, but this location takes the cake for service!\nI call before I leave the office to get an order to go.  They tell me 15 minutes.  When I arrive 15 minutes later, my order is ready!  \nThe service here is always friendly and they know my name.  The place is clean, too.\nThe back patio is huge and they have free wifi.  There's even a small bar outside, looking in.  I've never seen it completely empty. \nSo glad we finally have a Pita Jungle in CenPho!!!
