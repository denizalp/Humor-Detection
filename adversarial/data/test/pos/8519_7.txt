I'm going to give these guys another star.\n\nI went in tonight with a friend and we stuck to the veg items that were house specials. It was a good plan.\n\nWe started with the vegetable balls and they were outstanding! Next we had the Paneer Tikka and Palak Kofta (that was the name of the spinach dish I'd previously forgotten). Sooooo freaking good!!!\n\nOur waiter was awesome! The modern Indian music over the speakers was funky. Everything was really good... except the bathroom. \n\nSad face. When I walked into the ladies room I noticed how big it was and what a nice job they did decorating and putting nice soaps and lotions there. But then... I opened a stall. Eeeek! Closed that and on to the next. Even more gross. All of the toilet stalls were beyond nasty with the exception of the one that's door didn't stay closed. This was quite disappointing. Clearly they made a good effort to create a nice bathroom and patrons are not appreciating it. Nonetheless, perhaps the staff could go down every couple of hours to ensure tonight's state of affairs do not occur.
