I was just in the area and I wanted bubble tea after lunch. I happened to walk by sharetea and thought I would stop by. I walked to the store and noticed it was still close even though they were suppose to open at 12! And I was there at 12:20. Even another person tried to open the door and I had to tell them it was closed. So disappointed.\n\nAnyway I ended up inside FMP and went to prestotea instead! They never fail me.
