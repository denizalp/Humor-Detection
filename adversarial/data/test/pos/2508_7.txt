For the area this is probably your best bet for Thai food! And I am certainly happy to see some decent Thai in the area after having so many mediocre places and wondering if anyone in the area truly knows what Thai food is... just because you mix curry, some coconut, and random meats... don't mean you are legit! \n\nHowever, this place meets my standards :)\n\nI've came in a few times now to try out the many items. Great service all around, very friendly people! The menu has a decent selection of dishes. Curries are pretty standard, nothing is really popping out for me here, basically a lot of it is base then mixed with whatever. But I'm not mad at that, because it is decent curry and for the area that is a tall order!!!! \n\nFinding anything non Steak and Potatoes is a tall order, but luckily the planets are aligning and someone has given up his young in a sacrifice to the foodie gods; and Akron is baring fruit like the snow that typically falls in February...its happening..\n\nBut back to the place named of Rice Paper!\n\nThey did fall short for me on the Thai Ice Tea & Coffee, it was powdered based. Meh, not my style, I like the freshly brewed black tea personally as well as the freshly grounded coffee  :P\n\nTheir \"Golden Bag\" is really good, I actually enjoyed that the most and likely could go back over and over for it. I donno, I'm a sucker for dumpling, be that fried or not! It was tasty indeed. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for.... drums...... please......\n\n \"THAI\" \n\n....Because it is that! And while it might fall short in some areas for me personally, this is me being picky having had the pleasure of eating at some world class Thai joints, as well as having many traditional Thai cooked meals from Friends and Family whom are from Thailand!. \n\nIts a great place with good food.  Will return, often....
