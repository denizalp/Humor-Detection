Similar to the previous reviewer, I found this company after a quick web search. They had the lowest prices in the area, so I went for it. The carpet got clean to the landlord's satisfaction and I was only charged the agreed-upon price. No problems there.\n\nHowever, when \"Kevin Super\" came to clean the carpets, he also brought pamphlets about Duquesne Light \"ripping us off\" and tried to get us to switch our electric company. Weird and unprofessional, but not too big of a deal. He also suggested that my wife leave him alone in our apartment while he cleaned. Again, weird and kind of creepy, but I suppose it's possible that his intentions were innocent. \n\nThen the social media requests began. I had scheduled our cleaning via email and since then I have received periodic email invitations from him for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Today I got an email from a site called GoFundMe, which I guess is like Kickstarter, except he doesn't have to actually do anything. He's just asking for money. I hired this guy to clean my carpet two years ago and now he wants me to just give him money to go to Disneyworld. \n\nSo sure, Super Duper Carpet Cleaning will get your carpet clean, and they may even do it on the cheap. Whether that's worth years worth of email spam, well that's your call.
