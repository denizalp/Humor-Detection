Don't they read their Yelp reviews? I too had trouble getting waited on last weekend and this isn't the first time. The place was exactly as described by Bri..and after wading through the net surfers and congestion I finally managed to snag a 15 year-old sales person...only to find out by her frustrated response that her color T-shirt does not do sales, it means she is some type of tech support (oooo - haughty - am I supposed to bow?) and I need to find someone in the orange, or lime or tangerine or whatever T-shirt. \n\nSo I find Orange T-shirt who proceeds to reprimand me for having the audacity to want to buy an iphone without standing in the iphone line (what line? I see no line. That's why I stopped in today, not last week, because today there is no line). \n\nStopped short by my pointing out the line does not exist, Orange T then quizzes me about doing my pre-authorization...I haven't done it yet? Well, I'm welcome to sit in the store and enter my personal data amongst all the hovering net surfer losers. Time to make my escape, call ATT and have the darn thing ordered over the phone in less time than I spent navigating the color coded T-shirt brigade at the iStore. Whew.
