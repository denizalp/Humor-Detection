My friend and I wanted brunch and some good ol drinks so we decided to come here. I've been here before for drinks but never for their food. \n\nThey have brunch until 1 pm on Sundays and $5 drink specials. For food I ordered the green chile pork enchiladas. These were really good. It also comes with eggs. The only thing was, they were really spicy for me! I was dying! Lol.  For drinks we ordered the margaritas. Ohhhhh my goshhhh.. They were reallyyyyyy good. Especially for $5 and such a good size too. I got two of them. Let's just say I should've stuck to one. Lol. \n\nThis place probably would've gotten a 4 star from me if the service wasn't so horrible. Our server was neither sociable or friendly. We sat in the middle of these two tables and he went to their tables to help them and wouldn't even acknowledge us. Our food took about 30 minutes or longer to come out. No apologies for the wait or anything. I definitely won't be back for food. Maybe if I want a margarita...
