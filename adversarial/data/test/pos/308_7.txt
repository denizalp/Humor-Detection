i just finished another class here....Improv Games. i was so green to these style of \"acting\". i'm not quick witted...it usually takes me up to a day to come up with a \"witty\" reply. i'm more of a potty mouth, personal attack, politically incorrect response kind of guy, which obviously means i need to expand my vocabulary.\n\njavier whom led the class, was above helpful and insightful. he kept us motivated and critiqued the performances in a highly constructive way. i was also impressed at how he handled many of the younger students, whom seemed to have issues with not talking and paying attention at the right moments. \n\nagain, great class and instructor. i can't wait for my moment on the big screen...one action mega-blockbuster hit!!!!!!
