Great place to spend about 3 hours or so helping out exotic animals in need.\nI've been here before, years ago, but they have expanded and added at least 25 acres of Safari area ( the Lions were awesome!) and another 25 acres planned for the new Adventure area.\n\nAfter reading all the negative reviews, that mostly complained about the prices, all I can say is this:\n\"Yes, it gets expensive quickly, but I can honestly say that the animals and grounds looked much better kept than they did in my previous visits.\"\n\nIf I were spending that kind of money years later and saw little to no improvement, then I would be a 1 star reviewer too, but since the money seems to be better managed these days, I will make more of an effort to come out here more often.\n\nPros:\nExcellent selection of sea life ( 2 legged sea turtle was my favorite) \nRestaurant (Dillon's) attached (BONUS!)\nGiraffe feeding\nKoi feeding\nKangaroo Area\nLion Habitat\nFriendly Cockatoo's (1 kept saying \"Hello\" to us) \nBaby Animals\nLots of monkeys (although I saw a plastic spoon in one of their habitats, BAD monkeys!)\nPenguins\nGIANT Python!\nOtters\nSea Lions\n\nCons:\nExpensive
