This is one of the most beautiful and peaceful places in the valley.  I've had the privilege of visiting this resort on a few different occasions and for a variety of reasons.\n\nFrom the stay perspective:  Native American themed room. Nice comfortable bed. Very lovely and spacious room with a beautiful balcony.  Wonderful radiantly beautiful sunsets everyday in the desert.\n\nFrom the Dining and Entertainment:  I've been to all of the restaurants in the resort.  Kai lives up to its name and reputation and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the resort or the casino.  I've come for cocktails on the patio and sat outside by the fire pit.  This is my favorite part of this resort.  That terrace\/patio is just fantastic.   The walkways to the rooms are laced with benches for quiet moments and conversations and to steal a moment just before sunset.\n\nFrom the Events perspective:  I've attended a couple of meetings and most recently, the Fashioneta Fashion show.  I will be honest, for the table service during the fashion show, our server was quite rude and unpleasant.  But in general, during other events, the staff has always been pleasant to me.  The facilities are beautiful.\n\nThis is one of my favorite places to go to in the valley.  \n\nReturn factor: 100%\n.
