I will NOT go here again  ! I just had the manager Verbally assault me for asking for .50 cents that I lost in their car wash machine .\nHis name is Armando .\nI filled up on gasoline , while I was pumping I overheard some of the employees talking about female customers in a derogatory way . I thought wow, not too cool but the females could not hear them so cool . But still unprofessional. I went in to pay for gas inside . Cashier not friendly at all , but I can deal with that . She doesn't like her job I guess , but that has nothing to do with me so I can tolerate it .\nAs I was leaving I made an impulse decision to self wash my car as I was driving right by the washing bays . \nI went to the change machine and put in two dollars I got 7 quarters and 1 token . I put  the token in and the machine didn't register . I told myself oh it isn't registering the token so I put in a quarter . Still did not register . I told an employee by the car wash. She said I had to go back inside the gas station .\nI went back in , stood in line . The cashier called for Armando on the radio . She told me go back and wait by my car . He never came . It's 98 degrees at this point . After five minutes of waiting I asked another employee to point out Armando . He was walking around talking to people having a great time but not responding to the radio call .\nI approached him and told him my situation . He said just wait he will get there. I said it's too hot and I just wanna my .50 cents so I can leave .\nHe came and opened the cash box and pulled out the quarter and the token . He gives them back to me and walks away . I say excuse me I need a quarter for the token . He snapped at me and said that what you put in there . I said that's what your cash machine gave me .\nHe digs another quarter out of the machine and gives it to me and slams it shut hard .\nAs I was getting in my car I heard him cuss me out in Spanish . \nI stopped and asked him what did u just say ? And he came to my window and called me names in Spanish .\nI already had my .50 cents so I just pulled away .\nWill NEVER go back to this place .
