I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Why am I wasting my time yelping about a McDonald's.  But hey sometimes I crave a double cheeseburger and some fries or some hot cakes and an egg mcmuffin.  Also, I am a firm believer that a burger shouldn't have mayonnaise on it.  They are one of the only chains that don't put that disgusting crap on their burgers.  Plus, they serve the best diet coke.  I don't know what it is.  So, please don't hate me.  \n\nBut damn this place is the worst McDonald's I have ever been at.  Every freaking time I have been to the place they have messed up my order.  They either forgot the fries or forgot my sandwich or they don't have pickles for their burgers.  How the hell do you run out of pickles!!!!!  I love pickles..  I really do...  I always order extra pickles when I get a burger.  I only live a couple blocks from this place and I avoid it at all costs and go to one that is 3 miles away.  \n\nSo if you are craving some Mickey D's keep on moving past this location.
