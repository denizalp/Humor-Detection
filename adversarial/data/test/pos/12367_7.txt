I went back and forth on whether this place was a 2 star experience or a 3 star experience. Our server was very nice and attentive when she could be. It definitely seemed like they were running short on staff. I would think that for Sunday breakfast they would have been prepared to handle the usual traffic.\n\nFood was good, but nothing to write home about. \n\nThis place is a decent stopover in the back roads of Sun City Anthem, but no need to make the trek up the Oregon trail. Stop here if you're in the area, otherwise there are plenty of other options.\n\nWould I come back here? I wouldn't go out of my way.\n\nWould I recommend this place to others? Probably.
