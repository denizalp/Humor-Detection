Hit or miss, for sure -- some days, it's part old lady; other days, it's Scottsdale girl cast-offs. They've taken a bunch of my old shit and don't totally give customers the shaft on trade (unlike its emo counterpart, Buffalo Exchange). There's a lot of nice, current designer jeans, and a decent cashmere section. Indeed, there is a sprinkling of designer bags, but they're either beat to shit, four seasons old, or a knock-off. So yeah. It's not a super duper awesome place on my constant rotation, but I like to stop by if I have time, and it's a good place to unload my old stuff.
