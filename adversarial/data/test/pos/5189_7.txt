At Skyharbor, the car rental agencies have been combined into one gigantic off-site location. They are housed in an opulent palacial estate at the margin of the airport. A number of shuttle buses stand ready at the terminal exits to whisk you away to this monument of temporary automobile ownership. \n\nSuffice it to say, the place is huge. Most rental places that I go to seem to be housed in tin shacks that look like they could double as a mobile home. Considering its' size, I assumed that some sort of politician must have gathered the money to build this edifice: I searched for an Ozymandias-type poem at the entrance, but sadly could not find it. \n\nYet, the place does run smoothly; from the quick shuttles to the numerous employees at the counter, they will have you off and away in a matter of minutes. I will hand it to Thrifty, they were renting economy cars at a $15\/day rate that beat all of their competitors. A rental car for the same price that you may pay for lunch isn't a bad deal. Be wary of the typical mark-ups (e.g. if the tank isn't full, they will charge you over $7\/gallon to refill, etc.)\n\nThey have all the cars for the different agencies stored on the level below: a mixture of escalators and signs will guide you to the appropriate part of the cavernous storage floor. In the storage area, the staff were housed in small metal shacks (\"now that's more like it\") but were also quick and efficient. I had the keys to my quasi-stylish Chevy Aveo in moments and was rolling off the ramp onto I-10. \n\nAs far as rental return, this is close to as easy as you get. Anywhere within a short distance of the return hall has a blizzard of signs pointing you in the correct direction. There are so many signs that I was looking for a pamphlet that had some sort of bizarre factoid like \"more steel was used in the signs to the Skyharbor Rental Return than in the entire Empire State Building\" or something of that sort. Again, I could not find such a thing (although I'm convinced it's true).\n\nThese signs will guide you back to the rental return floor where you will use the reverse escalators to take you back to the mammoth greeting hall. Shuttles will once again take you back to Skyharbor for your return flight. Now, they have three separate terminals (2,3 and 4) which are both color-coded as well as identified with desert type creatures (e.g. one is \"roadrunner\" another something like \"gecko\", etc.). I'm not sure why you'd correlate \"roadrunner\" with terminal three (or was it four?), but you can always ask the helpful drivers: they know which flights go to which terminals.
