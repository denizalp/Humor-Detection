We went to Figo for lunch today. \n\nAlthough we missed our initial brunch reservation by 2 hours, they were kind enough to allow us to order off the brunch - instead of mid-day - menu.\n\nWe ordered the Margherita pizza and olives. Both were surprisingly good, despite the reviews we read of this place. \n\nAlong with a glass of wine and some Mezcal, the total was $60. (The one ounce of Mezcal seemed to be less than one ounce.) The whole meal was kind of expensive for what it was, although we did enjoy the food and atmosphere. It was pleasant. I liked the open kitchen concept and brightness of the interior. \n\nOur server was also pleasant, except on asking us at the end whether we wanted two bills instead of one. It was my husband. It felt awkward and inappropriate, and somewhat lessened my overall and otherwise to that point positive feeling of Figo. \n\nWhile we enjoyed the food we are not certain we would return because it wouldn't necessarily be our first choice.
