At this time the most popular Restaurant request amongst out-of-town guests, even those infrequently dining on Red Meat compelled to visit by a wide range of Appetizers, Salads, Entrees and Sides, it was as a party of eight that dinner was enjoyed at Jean Georges Steakhouse on Friday evening, a five course meal large enough to feed twelve once again leaving several diners speechless and the rest already planning a return visit. \n\nStill the longest tenured Restaurant on Aria's star-studded second floor, Chef Vongerichten occasionally  paying a visit but the menu and day-to-day cooking left to the talented Sean Griffin, it was just prior to a 6:30pm reservation that guests were  seated in a rounded booth where Beverages and Bread were served quickly, the Prix-Fixe Menu beginning with eight signature Wagyu and Truffle Gougeres plus a fully loaded Shellfish Tower featuring plump Gulf Shrimp and Lobster Tails plus Crab Legs as thick as some adult women's  forearms.\n\nNot yet turning the page from Winter to Spring, though subtle changes and seasonal Produce have persistently allowed  Chef Griffin to customize a menu even for a table of Vegans, it was with the last few Oysters and Clams slurped from their Shells that a trio of Salads next landed  in duplicate,  Jean-Georges signature Heirloom Tomatoes with Hearts of Palm not losing a bit of its freshness during colder months while the chopped Wedge and the new Spring Salad with Peas and Avocado shined thanks to its various textures and herbaceous Green Goddess.\n\nMatching high prices with larger than average portions, the $15 Bone Marrow always a jaw-dropper as it is served whole with Parsley Salad a la St. John, course three additionally presented two plates of Crunchy Organic Chicken that remains unparalleled even in Restaurants that specialize in fried Bird, the Tempura Batter standing at least a quarter inch off the Skin and delicious on its own but even better when paired bite-for-bite with saut√©ed Spinach soaked in Butter and Hot Sauce. \n \nCertainly not forgetting the Beef, everything from USDA Prime to certified A5 Wagyu available at a price, it was on a large tableside cart that Wagyu Brisket and a 42oz Tomahawk were sliced and served along with a sizable Dry-Aged Strip Steak, each prized by a different part of the table with a former \"well-done\" Midwesterner  particularly praiseful of the Medium-Rare Meat from Mishima Ranch while others marveled at the full flavored Strip and Brisket that was not merely fork, but spoon tender.\n \nComplimenting Beef with Sides, the Steakhouse's signature Crunchy Potatoes and buttery pureed Spuds with Black Truffles both as good as usual, those looking for something more seasonal may wish to turn their attention to simple Grilled Asparagus or elegant Pea and Carrot dishes while those who simply cannot get enough Meat are invited to dress up their Steaks with seared Foie Gras, grilled Salt Water Prawns or Scallops currently offered atop Polenta with Bok Choy, Peppers and Bacon.\n\nRounding out the evening with a platter featuring all five of the Restaurant's current Desserts, none new but all novel to seven first-timers, suspicions were confirmed that those who enjoy Passionfruit were particularly taken by the Gold Bar while the Market Apple Pie, Cheesecake and Salted Caramel Sundae all had their fans with not one bit of any returning to the kitchen despite many saying they were \"too full\" for Dessert before the wooden board's arrival.\n\nFIVE STARS:  Although some may wish to argue the merits of Luger's or Bern's nationally and Carnevino or CUT locally there is really no comparing any American Steakhouse to what Sean Griffin and his team at Jean Georges Steakhouse have been rolling out since last year's renovation, everything from the service pieces to Meats and Produce upgraded from an already fine baseline to a level that defines world-class.
