I love me some herbs and rye! \nThe food is pretty amazing. The quality of their entrees is just as delicious as the restaurants on the strip. You can't go wrong with their happy hour which is from 5-8pm. There are two lil stars marked next to the item on the menu. It's 50%off! Pretty cool! The ambience is dark and romanticish. Kinda reminds me of those vintage Russian rooms lol I don't know but it's pretty nice inside. My girls and I ordered the steak of course. Pretty bummed they ran out of truffle oil for my Mac and cheese but it was still rich and yummy!
