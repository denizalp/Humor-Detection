A lot of people were telling me to go try this buffet again-- it was really good. So I did and what a mistake. I went for the lunch buffet with 2 other people and we waited over an hour to get to the register.\n\nWhen we got to the register there was a group of guys next to me that were literally standing so close to me they were touching me and leaning over the counter while I was paying. They were staring at my credit card. The cashier kept looking at them but never said a word. When I was almost done paying the guy totally smashes into me. Him and his group decided it would be a good idea to exchange some words with me. The cashier still never said a word. I found this totally inappropriate and would never return just for this reason.\n\nBut we went inside and were extremely disappointed. The buffet is very small, they only have a few stations. The salad bar might as well not even exist. What a joke! They had a \"vegan\" section that looked like it had not been refreshed in days. Every person that walked up to it, just turned and walked away. \n\nThe were not a lot of choices unless you like Asian food. That was the only station they were paying any attention too. Everything else looked old and was just not worth eating. \n\nThe dessert station also a total let down. They had 2 vegan choices (choc. pudding and a brownie) both disgusting. Very few choices for other items. There main focus on dessert is the gelato case and it wasn't that good. \n\nI felt this entire experience was a complete waste of my money and time and I will never go back to the Palms. This was my first time back since they re did the place and it is worse now than before.
