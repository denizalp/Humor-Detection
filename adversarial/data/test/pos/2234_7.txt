Of course I had to come here - they serve sweetbreads, which I love and which seems to be tricky to find even with Phoenix's burgeoning food scene. Beautifully seared with cauliflower and capers, it was delectable. I paired that with a serrano strawberry-rita which was delicious and quite a generous pour. The ambiance is trendy without feeling intimidating, and the service is very friendly. Also, it's really nice to have an establishment where you can get fine drinks and good comestibles past midnight, like my friends and I did when we felt like having food and drinks at nearly 1 a.m. not long ago.
