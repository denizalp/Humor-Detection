Went here with my sister a few days ago. We got steamed buns for appetizers. I believe we had Kung Pao steamed buns. They were small but quite tasty. It was also happy hours me them much cheaper. Yelp check in at this time saved me 10% on the dinner. We had ramen and chicken and dumplings for our entrees. Full of great flavors.
