Are you someone with too much money on your hands? NO? Perhaps too much time (like me?) Then come visit this store.\n\nI feel like it's a store owned by rich people because they're bored and felt like they had to do something with their lives, and filled the store with stuff to sell other rich folks things that they don't really want or need because they're also bored and feel the need to shop. \n\nLike that.\n\nI think it's owned by a mother and daughter team (they were the two in the store, booking a hair appointment) that just picked out stuff they liked to display around the shop. At least the daughter said 'Hello' to me, I didn't get that at Le Labo, as I was COMPLETELY ignored because of my lack of flashy jewels, pearls, and the prerequisite \"I'm-so-rich-I-sound-like-a-bored-valley-girl\" accent.\n\nSome of it was cute if I had a home and wanted to decorate, but their 'too-good-for-customer-service' attitude turned me off.\n\nThe jewellery looked all right, but not modern or clean, think heavy, ornate gold jewellery with fake gemstones that are over the top.\n\nThey had a few (old) random cook books for decoration... and in general, it wasn't something I'd be interested in as a store as I don't decorate.\n\nLovely throws however, in baby alpaca wool and cashmere, and priced around $250  - $300 which made me pet them, but back away.\n\nCan't say I'd want to step back in there because there's a general musty smell of bad, moist breath, although no body odour stench (my guess is that they don't air out the place enough and they talk A LOT to each other).\n\nWhat is WRONG with this area? \n\nIt's like they're so rich, they have no idea how to open a door or a window once in a while to let fresh air in because the maid usually does it for them. (Kidding... sorta.)
