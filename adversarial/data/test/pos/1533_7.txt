After a long day (10 hours of test\/scans) at the Mayo in Fountain Hills, I felt like pancakes so Yelped it.  You expect the food from the IHops to taste somewhat the same.  My sampler was good, but the pancake was not.  I was not sure what it was??  Batter is old?  My parents mentioned the same thing that their pancakes were not very good either.  So, I am not crazy yet.  The service was slow.
