As a new home owner with a pool, I knew pool service was important. I made the mistake of signing up with Gilbert pool service... \n\nAfter receiving a review of my pool Im told ill need to have some work done on the pump, no big deal the pool is a little older whatever. \n\n I pay the $200 to have a gasket and the filter basket replaced. I returned home after having the work done and the filter basket is laying in my landscaping and there is an opened bottle of chemicals sitting near the pool pump on the ground... No I know its not their responsibility but there are signs that a dog lives here and having opened chemical bottles on the ground is a HUGE problem for me... I have an English Bulldog and if you know anything about them they are not a cheap bread. On top of that I would be devastated if Charlie got into the chemicals that Gilbert pools just carelessly left laying around. On top of that, the next day when there was some wind the bottle was knocked over and the contents drained out into my landscaping... im sure I was billed for those chemicals too.\n\nabout 1 1\/2 months into having their service I come home to find my pool is completely green... what the hell am I paying for?!?!? the two months I maintained the pool before having their service, I was able to avoid anything like this.\n\nI later found the discarded trash from the stickers they applied to my timer box and pump laying on the ground... what the hell!?!? you are working at a customers house and you just throw trash all over the ground? the most unprofessional company I have ever done business with!!\n\nI am finally cancelling service with this joke of a company after 3 months service as my pool has been in such a state that I cannot swim in it at all. I will take on the responsibilities of cleaning it myself moving forward.\n\n I will attach some pics of the state they kept my pool in for the last 2 weeks. I wish I had a pic of it when it was green... Anyway DO NOT DO BUSINESS with this company!
