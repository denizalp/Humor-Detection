Reminds me of the places in Hawaii that has tons of food for a good price.  The plate lunch portions are easily large enough for two people and filling. The barbq mix plate lunch is a great deal, but wish their galbi short ribs did have so much fat and that this combo included some meat jeon.  The bbq chicken and bbq beef were my favorite, so next time, I will just order the Chicken and Beef combo or their BBQ & Katsu Mix plate lunch combo. \n\nIf dining alone, their mini meals are the way to go. Their macaroni salad is quite tasty! Maybe I will get an extra side of this too.  Yum.  Good place to dine if craving for the flavors of Hawaii without spending so much money. \n\nPlease add meat jeon to the menu too!
