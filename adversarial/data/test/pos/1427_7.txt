What a total disappointment!  I am a native Phoenix woman.  Raised 12 steps from Root salon.  My family still lives in the same house they bought over 60 years ago.  So, when I relocated to Phx I was over joyed to learn of a salon with a reputed good reputation right in my neighborhood.  I walked in thinking the Salon was an Aveda salon.  I was wrong.  No problem.  I read all the reviews the night before I entered the salon.  Everyone is seemingly happy (okay almost everyone) about their color and cut results.  I walk in the Salon, no greeting although the woman who is ignoring me I learn later is the owner.  I inquire about the Aveda confusion.  She is clearly irritated.  How did you get that idea? she wants to know.  Well, I ask what color products do you use?  Now she is barely able to contain that I am on her last nerve.  \"An Italian Brand, and I am the western Educator....\"  So, I'm wondering, why are you so angry? Educate already!  No way!  I ask her about a referral to an Aveda salon.  She looks over her shoulder and asks a woman who is not at all annoyed.  I get the referrral, but I already know of the salon as I read their reviews last night too.  I ask if I could use the phone book.  Lauren looks up the address and phone number, and hands me the small piece of paper.  Somewhere in the conversation I mention that I read all of the reviews on her salon the night before.  She quickly tells me that she is going to get a new review today.  Well, Lauren, you're right.  This is your new review.  MY experience is that you lost a potential very good customer.  I get my hair cut and colored every 5 weeks.  I am loyal, and I understand what it is to run a business.  I ran my own business for well over a decade.  MY impression is that you have a particular mind-set about who your customer base is.  So ladies, if you  are anywhere past mid-forties, I would stay away!  I honestly believe that Lauren could have, and should have taken 5 minutes to compare and contrast her product with Aveda.  Of course there is the possibility that in this economy Lauren is doing so well, that she can afford to cater to a certain age\/genre.  Good luck with that!  Here's what is really depressing:  I have 5 sisters, a million extended family members, and tons of friends.  We all live in the neighborhood.  Root lost not just me, but a potential host of family and friends.  In summary Lauren here is what I want you to know.  That space you occupy may be your business space, but that is my home space.  I took ballet lessons as a young girl three doors down from you.  I have family that own businesses steps from you.   I'm hurt, shocked, and totally disappointed at your attitude.  I have seen people come and go from that complex.  Your attitude matters.  I may not look like the customer you want to cater to, but I will not be treated with such disrespect and sit silent so that someone else might experience that same kind of treatment.  In my opinion you are going to need to require way more of yourself!
