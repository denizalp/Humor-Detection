Pretty bad experience here.. went to get some simple supplies, needles, thread, etc.. sales associate was extremely condescending and rude. She totally ignored what I said I needed and suggested some useless stuff. Even though she didn't know what she was talking about she continued to ignore my needs and give completely incorrect advice. Apparently had no clue that upholstery fabric is different from regular fabric. At least she found the needles I was looking for. Very disorganized store with a mediocre selection at best.\n\nWent across the street to world sewing centres after and breathed a sigh of relief. Won't be returning.
