First off, I wouldn't consider myself the least bit an early-riser (well, not for breakfast anyways).  I was here at 6:30 in the morn, lacking sleep, and I am still able to recall the killer breakfast at this place.  I honestly didn't even know this Egg Works had a location on Sunset (even though it has been there forever), but I'm glad I stopped in.  I needed to make a stop to the airport and breakfast prior to doing so just seemed like a good idea.\nI'll probably never see this place that early in the morning again though.\n\nSo being 6:30 in the am, I figured the place would be desolate, but I was taken by surprise when I entered and saw 3 other parties grubbing on some Egg Works offerings.  Okay, 3 parties isn't much, but seriously... it's 6:30!  That was a good indicator that this place means business.  After people-watching while waiting for my juice to be freshly squeezed from their orange tree that is growing within the walls of their kitchen (seriously it took a minute, but maybe I'm just not as patient during this hour), i noticed that the 3 other parties were regulars.  Regulars equals good service!    Our waitress was very helpful and even made mention of her picks on the menu.  I ended up going with the Haole Moco, which is an Americanized version of the ever-so-popular Hawaiian Loco Moco. Nice!\n\nPros:\n* good portion sizes... I even had to take some to go\n* okay so no Orange Tree in the kitchen to my knowledge, but it was fresh\n* open early for you early-risers (or late sleepers).\n* good service\n\nCons:\n* service can be a bit slow at times due to small talk w\/ regulars\n\nTips:\n  They have this little flippy-thing that doubles as a salt\/pepper shaker holder.  You can flip over to a different color, which indicates to the waitress that you are in need of assistance.  Pretty nifty.  I'll be honest, I just stared at it for a good minute or two, but since there were obstructions and I was entering the beginning stages of my food-coma, I said forget it and just waited for an opportunity to make eye-contact with the waitress to get the bill.  Seems pretty cool though. I'll try it next time I go and let you know if the waitress actually sees it in a timely manner.\n\n  One more tip, look up and watch the news.  It's more informative than people-watching, but I can't say it's more fun.
