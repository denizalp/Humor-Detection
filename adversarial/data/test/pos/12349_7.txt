One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  The location is great, across from the Wynn, right on the strip, great for people watching. I've tried many different items on their menu and everything is delicious. My personal favorites are the fried pickles, buffalo chicken sandwich, and sweet potato fries. Their shakes are the best, I recommend strawberry banana, and you can add alcohol & still tastes great. The outdoor seating is great for a nice lunch in the sun or some evening drinks when the sun is going down.
