Or as I like to call this place, Testicle Brewing. You're better off drinking college beer and hoping you get drunk off it faster since it has little taste. These guys IPAs are bitter pine bombs (too many hops in the boil), very flat, and the stout and saison were underattenuated trash. Shame because it's in a really really cool location.
