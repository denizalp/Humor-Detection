This Saturday a small group of friends and I stopped in for a drink for my Birthday. It was busy, I'm not exactly sure how this place is still in business because every time I've gone I have had a bad experience. After my recent experience was so horrible I felt compelled to write a review. \n\nWhen we arrived we immediately noticed it was busy. We went downstairs to try to get a table and drink, no one was there so we immediately felt lucky. We all ordered a drink, and found a booth in the back. We had literally been down there long enough to take a sip when a bartender (male) approached us and very rudely told us they were closing downstairs and we had to leave; in which he gave us 5 minutes to \"get out\".\n\nI mean, did I just die and wake up as a giant baby? Did this guy just speak to me as if I was a child who was up to no good? Yep! Ok, not a good start. My friend and I went to the bathroom downstairs before we decided to head back up-- assuming we could get in and out quickly. When we came out of the bathroom, we noticed our small group was being reprimanded by a security guard who clearly thought he was apart of the secret service. \n\nThis guy. I mean, wow. He spoke to my friends as if they were scum, a big inconvenience to the establishment for being downstairs, when we were clearly ordered to go back upstairs -- how dare we?!! Apparently this jerkoff was asking them why they were not sprinting back upstairs and clearly violating a direct order. My boyfriend calmly explained that they were waiting for us to return from the bathroom -- By the way they were literally standing in the stair well.\n\nUpstairs we received excellent service from the waitress who was very attentive and friendly. Which is such a shame, because no one was ordering another drink after that! Whilst my friends finished their drinks I quietly observed their security staff. They were all dressed similarly. Khaki cargo pants, which I'm sure were equipped with the essentials: flash light, pepper spray, a small picture of themselves to gaze upon during down time. One guy had on leather gloves... No joke! They all had ear pieces in and clearly thought very highly of themselves. I thought to myself, \"Secret Service Rejects\"!\n\nThe whole place is just terrible. The people who chose to spend their evening there were typical... Basic. Terrible! You should never treat patrons as if they're criminal. I would hate to claim that the experience ruined my birthday, but it did. I left not understanding why they had treated us so poorly. Had I just stepped into some time portal or a portion of Hell on Earth, where those in the service industry should be allowed to treat humans like dog shit? I will never go back. I will make it my JOB to tell everyone I know about our experience to ensure they don't go there.
