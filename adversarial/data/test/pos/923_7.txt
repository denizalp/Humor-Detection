This Louis Vuitton store on Bloor may be the best in Canada but it lacks in so many ways compared to other cities I have shopped. When I do shop at Louis Vuitton Toronto, I look for Elvis and would encourage you to do the same. Elvis is so honest with his opinion, you wont go wrong. Personally, I prefer the Louis Vuittom in Hong Kong. I do  enter into the Toronto location from time to time but will usually make my final purchase over seas. Far better service,  more current selection and the no tax policy in Hong Kong is a bonus and makes it such a bargain.
