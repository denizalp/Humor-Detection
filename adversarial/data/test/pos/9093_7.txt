Oh I am really in love with this place! I wish there was something just like the Main Dish close to wear I live - I would pop in to buy lunches and dinners to go, and salads, pastas and pre-cooked meals to stock my fridge with, all the time! \n\nThe staff is super friendly and helpful. As it was my first time in, they all explained how the place works, the difference between pre-made meals that you can take to-go, as well as the hot and made to order dishes if you are staying to eat in. \n\nThe have a small wine bar, high end loose leaf teas, a fabulous selection of truffles and macarons for dessert. And the drink cooler is stocked with really cool lemonades and fresh pressed juices. \n\nI had a soup and salad combo that had one of the best broccoli cheddar soups ever! It was so yummy, but somehow seemed actually healthy (or health conscience at least!) \n\nI 100% suggest stopping in to The Main Dish to try out the array of unique and salads, sides, apps and mains.
