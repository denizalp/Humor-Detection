This place is pretty pricey but I got a Groupon which was a great deal. You can also check in on yelp to receive 20% off. \n\nThey give you bread & some type of oil which is good & flavorful. But we also asked for butter & it taste so good with butter & the oil. \n\nWe got the chicken parmigiana & the chicken marsala the chicken was huge for both plates. You can customize your plate which I didn't know, the server only told us after. Like less mushrooms for the chicken marsala and if you don't want veggies you can substitute it for potatoes which you definitely need more for the marsala.\n\nThey also have a patio outside and a bar inside.
