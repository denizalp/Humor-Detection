it hurts my feelings to write a bad review, but....\ni went in last week with my mom for breakfast and we were pretty excited.  even for how busy it was, there was plenty of parking, the place is adorable, and the staff are very friendly.  so what could possibly go wrong?  twice?  well, the burger.  they ask how you would like it cooked, which leads me to believe i get to choose my own adventure in doneness, but thats a big lie.  i said rare and was given a well done burger.  i want red, i got black.  ok, no big deal, i went up and asked for a replacement and they didnt give me an ounce of attitude or hassle, and the owner even came over and personally apologized.  they went through such great lengths, i just felt like an asshole.  it was a good burger, i could have choked it down and not made anyone uncomfortable.  the next burger comes out after a 10 minute tableside dissertation about the quality of their meat and yadda yadda, which we endured, but as soon as burger 2 appears, the tumbleweed appeared and suddenly no one cared.  probably because this was also overcooked completely through.  so i payed for 1 burger, received 2, and ate 0.\ni think with a little fine tuning, this place could pull a few more stars from me, it has a lot of nice things going for it, but when a person places an order for a specific meat cook, they should get it, especially the second time.  the cook should be able to accomplish this, the server should check it before bringing the order out, and the second time, when the corrected version is supposed to be delivered, the management should double check it.\nit will be a while before i think i will find myself there again, but i surely will be back, hopefully to update my rating to a better one.\n(side note, the pickles are gross.  but thats just my opinion)
