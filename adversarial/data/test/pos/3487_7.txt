One of the last \"classic\" Vegas casinos on the strip has finally closed. Good riddance? Probably. The Riv has its time in the sun, but in the ever changing climate of sin city and the desert that hosts it, nothing is forever.\n\nFor one of the non-mega casino umbrella properties (i.e. non-Caesars \/ MGM \/ etc.), it is one of Vegas longest surviving casinos. For the last 50 years the Riviera graced the north part of the strip with its over the top scintillating star theme, having been in and out of bankruptcy from the very moment it was erected. Personally, I'm surprised that it even lasted this long.\n\nFor serious players, gambling here was more about nostalgia than it was about earning the comp dollar. The casino itself was understandably dated and the cheesy factor was evident throughout the property. For what it's worth, it felt more fun to play here than be surrounded by a whole 'nother crowd in Downtown, but at some point the Riviera was practically a senior citizen home.\n\nThe rooms were never fancy, even the higher end suites would be trumped by low grade suites of mid tier properties. But with a lesser association, this means getting comps was no big deal. Even from a retail stance, getting a room here for $50 and under during the week was a relatively frequent reality.\n\nI wish I were around the years when Liberace was a headliner here. To go from him to Crazy Girls (a pseudo \"risque\" nudie show) seems like a desperate transition for attention. Following that was a bunch of D list celebrities filling space and time, adding to the charm of being here I suppose.\n\nThe days for properties like this are numbered. When the Stardust imploded several years ago, it was a signal that a new wave of mega properties were to hit the Strip. It was only a matter of time before the Riviera followed suit. As of last month, it finally has.\n\nR.I.P.
