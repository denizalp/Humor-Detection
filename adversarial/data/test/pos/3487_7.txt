Feeling crabby (literally) I went to the Crab Corner with all intention of being disappointed.  When my order of mini crab cakes arrived, I was pleasantly surprised they were full of flaky, sweet blue crab.  Very tasty without much in the way of added flavorings to take away from the crab.  That led me to try the combo fried clams and catfish plate with hush puppies.  The clams were thick and sweet but the catfish a bit dry.  The blue crab soup that came with it was delicious.\nCan't wait to go back.
