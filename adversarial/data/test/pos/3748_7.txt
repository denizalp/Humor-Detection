Not a fan of Restaurant Week, the opinion that a donation can be made to one's favorite charity anonymously without suffering a plug and chug menu for the masses apparently uncommon in modern society, it was largely a result of longtime curiosity that led to dinner at The House of Blues Foundation Room on Saturday night.\n\nFamously known as the lone occupant of Mandalay Bay's 63rd Floor, a Restaurant-slash-Nightclub that remains one of Sin City's lone proponents of a dress-code demanding Business Casual or better, it is within the hotel lobby that guests will find elevators behind a velvet rope, the ascent fairly quick to a space designed to impress and staff clearly hired as much for their looks as abilities to seat and serve.\n\nOne of eight such venues across America, the recent hiring of Chef Corey Miller from Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM promising upcoming menu changes per a middle-aged male waiter, it is after passing by statues of Buddha and other Deities that guests are seated in a room of polished wood with a balcony offering a panoramic view of Las Vegas Boulevard, a \"guest-list\" and\/or cover charge apparently the only way to assure admission after dark on busier nights.\n\nPriced significantly higher than House of Blues Restaurant or recently introduced B-Side, Happy Hour in the spacious Bar offering some good deals Sunday through Thursday while the current Restaurant Week three-course offers over 25% off a collection of longtime signatures, it was with Strip-priced Cocktails deferred that a Bread Basket appeared featuring five options alongside three Dips or Spreads, the fact that some were still warm a nice touch though only the Ciabatta lightly speckled with Olives and Crisps spread with Red Pepper Hummus proved worth more than a single taste.\n\nPlaying mid-tempo Pop overhead, the lack of Blues or even Rock telling as much about Foundation Room's target audience as a menu loosely rooted in the South but otherwise nondescript American 'Steakhouse,' it was with \"Salmon and a Salad with Dressing on the side\" tourists seated on both sides that Foundation Room's \"Jumbo\" Lump Crabcakes were presented, the adjective in reference not to portion but the chunks of sweet Crustacean that showed well without much binder beneath a fairly basic Apple and Fennel Salad.  \n\nDecidedly curious about $40 Shrimp and Grits, \"My Cousin Vinny\" quotes about *Magic* Grits seemingly the only explanation for such a price, it was perhaps predictable that neither portion nor presentation outperformed what one gets at Yardbird for $28 or down South for $15, the fact that Shrimp were well cooked but largely overwhelmed by spices and salinity also worth noting.\n\nExcellent in terms of service, both the Waiter and Runners present without being obtrusive and always quick to clear plates or refill Water, it was after Chef Miller toured the room checking in on guests that Dessert was presented, a small ramekin with bubbling Berries at the base and Custard-soaked Cubes of Bread beneath melting Peanut Butter Ice Cream definitely the night's highlight while \"fresh baked\" Cookies that arrived no more than five minutes after ordering were probably better described as \"warmed-to-order,\" the flavors just fine but texture medium-crisp from edge to center and none as noteworthy as the Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream that is sweet yet subtle and one of the better scoops in Sin City.\n\nTWO AND A HALF STARS:  Undeniably a concept more about the scene than its cuisine The House of Blues Foundation Room offers an experience well-suited to tourists and something 'fancy' but accessible, though with so many great Restaurants at Mandalay Bay and Rivea offering a better view at a similar pricepoint there seems little reason to book a table rather than just stopping in for Ice Cream or a Drink at the Bar.
