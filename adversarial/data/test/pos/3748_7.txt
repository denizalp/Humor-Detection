This is an absolute must go to whenever my childhood friends come visit.  Mainly because most of my life of video games was with them. Whether it's downing multiple bottles of Arrogant Bastard Ale and playing the fighting games at the bar or kicking it old school playing games like Gauntlet, Rampage or Double Dragon at 50 cents a pop, this is an awesome place to hang out for an hour or two.  I also like most of the music they spin.
