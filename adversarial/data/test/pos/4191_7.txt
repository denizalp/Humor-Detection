Firstly, I must say that I'm quite surprised at the positive reviews for this place! Come on guys, you can't be serious. \n\nI happened to be in area recently, and remembered reading all the great reviews about this place from the YELP community. So needless to say i was quite eager to try this place. \n\nMy first impression of this place was I thought it was closed. Its very unassuming, however i realize this is a takeout place so I reserved judgement. I was greeted by some kids behind the counter. I looked at the price list and I was floored. 6 samosas for $5.45!! Come on now. Surely the samosas must be big....NOT!..one samosa can be consumed in two bites! So right off the bat, I'm thinking \" these better taste good\". To make matters worse, they didn't have many items they indicated on their menu. \n\nI got Tandoori Chicken Samosa, Veggie, Beef. Anyways the first bite...yuck... Again, sadly I was very disappointed, they are oily and not flavourful at all. \n\nTo add to this, apparently they keep the ready-made samosas in a fridge and deep fry them when required! Not very fresh at all. \n\nIf you know anything about samosa and how they should taste, do not go here. There is a place in Scarborough called Embassy Samosa King where you get 5 samosas for 1$, and they taste very fresh.. \n\nThis place is a waste...
