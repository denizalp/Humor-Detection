I don't really do house juice cause the consistency of house made juice are not the same ...some batches will b good and some other times it's just not the same ...I bought 60 ml of elephant milk was amazing at first then as the week went on the flavor was so light ....but don't get me wrong it's cheap but this is the reason y I hate house juice ...rather spend the money on premium juice also the dood told me to let the juice steep for a few days lol wtf so the flavor is better ...if you like cheap crap juice then go here
