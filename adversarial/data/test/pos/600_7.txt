If you need booze and don't wanna spend a ton of money, head straight to Wood man's.  They have the largest liquor and beer selection in town and it's likely the cheapest too. You can find anything here! \n\nThe rest of the store is a lil' but questionable, but super affordable.  I can't really recommend the produce; the few times I've bought some the quality has been iffy.  Cheese, bread and packaged goods fare much better. This place is huge and always crowded so bring your patience, maybe some xanax and a little extra time.
