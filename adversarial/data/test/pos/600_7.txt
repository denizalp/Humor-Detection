This honestly was one of the worst places myself and my partner have been to. The food was super bland ( I had the steak and mushroom pie) and it tasted like dog food. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold and and had no seasoning to them. As for the wings they were very small and were nothing to write home about. The service was not good, the waitress didn't know the menu and wasn't very talented (took away pints before they were done). She should of written down the orders and she had made a mistake on the meals. She did try her best but it seemed she was in over her head. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone if they wanted to go for food, but the restaurant itself looked nice and I would maybe try to go for a drink but nothing else.
