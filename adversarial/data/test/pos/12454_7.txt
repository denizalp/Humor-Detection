This is such a great place with great people - Sheridan and Jenny are so wonderful and hospitable! The menu is simple, but it's all you need to fulfill your poultry needs. They use Mary's free-range organic chicken for all their dishes. There's either poached chicken, fried chicken tenders, or chicken wings.\n\nHainan Chicken Rice ($8.99): poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat with pickled cucumbers and mustard greens. Served with housemade soy, ginger scallion, and sambal sauces, and a side of chicken broth. I added a fried egg ($1.99) and Chinese sausage ($1.99). This dish is phenomenal. It's Asian comfort food at its finest. Every element is so wonderful. The chicken, the rice, and especially the housemade sauces. I had to get extra ginger scallion. Yum. I could eat this all the time.\n\nMrs. Han's Twice-Cooked Szechuan Chicken Wings and Thai Style Chicken Wings: fish sauce, garlic, and lemon (1 pound, $7.99). Both extremely flavorful! Also, just really great wings. You get a cute metal bucket to put your bones.\n\nI'm definitely going back to try the other dishes, but the Hainan Chicken Rice is a must on every visit!
