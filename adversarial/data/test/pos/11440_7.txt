I had been doing all my grocery shopping at Highland Farms, Dufferin Street for about 15 years.\nWhen they started charging 5 cents for every plastic shopping bag and had no alternative means of packing my purchases I stopped shopping there.\nIt has been over a year now and that plastic bag by law has been repealed long ago.\nAbout a month ago I went back. They are still gouging their customers 5 cents per bag.\nSo, like the good business men they are, instead of getting $60 to $100 per week or more from me they get nothing. All that because they hoped to squeeze 50 or 60 cents extra every week out of my shopping budget.\nGo figure?\n\nThe last time I wrote them a letter about a month ago they could not be bothered to respond.\n\nMickey Oberman
