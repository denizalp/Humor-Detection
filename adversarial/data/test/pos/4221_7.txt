I swear I thought this place was a Korean restaurant, where some immigrants couldn't spell \"Galbi\" correctly in English. Heh, jokes on me now. I def didn't take French class back in school. Anyways, went here for a birthday celebration. \n\nFresh baked free bread- 3 star. It was good, but I've had better. Why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a French resto?\n\nBone-in rib-eye- 5 star. It was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. I had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. The fries (think french fry chips) were okay. I wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. The burnaise sauce was SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOD. Dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! \n\nCaramelized scallops with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. The scallops were OK. It was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go I guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. The standout is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS that were included. This is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. \nThey were the BEST Brussel Sprouts I have EVER had in my life. It was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to \nfantabulous. You can order these as a side. \n\nMussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. I wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. It was OK for me. I couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) \n\nMacaroni Gratin- 3 star. This was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. It wasn't spectacular or memorable, and I'd skip this next time. Plus, it's carby...I just did you a huge favor. \n\nFree dessert for my bday- some Eclair with ice cream. Meh, but it was free. \n\nAs strange as this may sound, I'd go back here JUST to eat the brussels sprouts. I'm drooling thinking of this veggie that normally smells like someone let out a huge fart and left it lingering for a hot minute. I have been \"de-traumatized\" via the Mon Ami Gabi experience.
