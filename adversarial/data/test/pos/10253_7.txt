BevMo is like Toys R Us for alcoholics. This is THE place to go for a fantastic selection of beer, wine and liquor. I'm a bit and an import\/foreign snob, so there's nowhere else in the valley I can go to get my Thai, Singapore, Chinese, Indian and other beers. There selection of ales and lagers from The UK is particularly impressive. They also have some good deals on wine. My only complaint is that they don't have enough South African red wines to choose from. But the good news is that I'm always able to find something I'll enjoy. \n\nThey also have party accessories and equipment such as Margarita machines, and good selection of drink vessels and other items to make your next part memorable.\n\nI always feel that rush of excitement whenever I walk through BevMo's doors!
