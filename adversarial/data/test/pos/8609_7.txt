I'm craving the Chicken Little sandwich with the pickle and mayo. Went through drive-thru. Took five minutes to reach the loudspeaker menu. Placed my order: Famous Bowl and Chicken Little sandwich. Order was received. Waited another ten minutes to reach the window. \"We're out of sandwiches, so I have you down for the famous bowl, you good with that?\" So here I am looking at the guy, then looking at the exit, then looking at him, then looking at the exit .. \"Yeah, fine.\" I made payment, got the bowl, then drove all the way down to the KFC near 24th St to order just a Chicken Little.\n\nDon't screw me over when I'm craving a thing.\n\nIncidentally, the bowl they handed me didn't come with a spork (nor a spoon, nor a fork). They expected me to eat a bowl full of gravy and corn and potatoes with my fingers!
