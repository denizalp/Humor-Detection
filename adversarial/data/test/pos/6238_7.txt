For sandwiches, this place is the best in the city. I've never been disappointed. Their soups are great too. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5, is because they changed their little side salad and it just ain't as good anymore, ya hear? Also, it's kinda pricey.  I'm a cheap-o.\n\nBut all around delicious and I want it in my belly constantly.
