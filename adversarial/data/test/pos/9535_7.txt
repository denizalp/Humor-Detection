So last night the GF and I drove 30+ miles across the valley to meet friends at the Bad Beat Brewery.  We sat down at the table and a buddy asked if we were hungry and informed us of a food truck parked outside. More consumed with consuming some Bad Beats brew than consuming food, I said that's cool and that was about it........Fast forward to another buddy saying he was hungry and out the door he went....Fast forward to a happy gentleman walking into Bad Beats with a couple paper trays of whatever.....and then the conversation began.  What are you eating?  Bacon cheeseburger times two and some bacon fries.  What?!  Yeah....it's the Bacon Boys.  First chance I got so as not to appear socially awkward...I was out.  \n\nIt was a very short walk over to food truck which was parked next to another brewery in the immediate area.  Now my experiences with other food trucks has not been that great.  I live in a community that has food trucks come and visit from time to time.  My one and only experience sort of sucked.  One would think that a food truck would the epitome of hospitality.  My brief experience would prove not.  Long waits and some to zero personality.\n\nI arrived at the Bacon Boys Truck and started checking things out.  Being that it was just me, I thought perhaps I would get a little more personal attention than I got.  I was a BBT virgin after all. I started to feel that pressure to order but no one wants to get to know you or help you out with an order. O'well....I looked at the computer screen and selected a bacon grilled cheese sandwich, bacon fries, and a bacon wrapped hot dog w\/ Sriracha mayo.  All was paid with my AMX.  I thought I would be able to tip, but despite the option being available on the iPad.  The gentleman taking the order closed out the order.  I regret I had no cash to tip him.\n\nI bounced back to Bad Beats and stood by for the order.  In short order....the same happy gentleman appeared bearing the treats I had previously ordered.  Happy, happy, joy, joy!\n\nThe GF and I shared everything minus the bacon wrapped dog.  She did not grow up near the border as I did and did not have the same appreciation for bacon wrapped tubed meat as I do.\n\nBacon, bacon, bacon,,,perfectly cooked. The fries were mostly short variety and required a very specific pinch technique.  This coupled with lack of assistance at the truck brings this down to a four star review.\n\nIf your sipping the nectar of the Gods in a commercial park in Hendo or anywhere for that matter..and should your hear of this divine pork wagon slinging it's wares in area...it will absolutely compliment the brew and your state of mind.
