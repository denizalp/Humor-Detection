O yeah. This was my first Vegas show and it was amazing. I loved every second of it.\n\nSeats: Section 103, F 6\/7. Damn. Great. Seats. (But that's just my opinion. I could see how being a few rows back to see a bit more of the stage as a whole would be better for some people.)\n\nPrice: yeah, expensive...but that's why you should be a MLife players club member and get that shiz 2-for-1 and stop your bitchin'!\n\nIt's so different seeing these kind of acrobatics and aerial stunts in person. How can somebody's body do that? It is truly impressive. Everything was really beautiful.\n\nMy only complaint is that I didn't have more pairs of eyeballs to take everything in. I guess this just means that I'll have to see it again!
