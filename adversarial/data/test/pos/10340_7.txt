Going mostly off the price of the rooms the Luxor isn't too bad, generally the Luxor is one of the 5 least expensive hotels on the strip even though it's at the beginning of the strip. The rooms are decent, the tower rooms are more up to date than the pyramid rooms, and come with a shower & bath tub for the standard rooms.\n\nThe casino floor is easy to get around without getting lost since the building isn't that big. There's a decent sports book, & poker room toward the back of the casino, & a good amount of table games. The casino is also connected to the Mandalay Bay, & Excalibar so you can stay indoors to avoid the heat & walk right over to either one if you wanted to walk around & check out other casinos.\n\nThe pool & gym here (that's part of that $25 resort fee that you're forced to pay everyday) are pretty basic. Nothing great, but the pool is ok enough to hang out & enjoy the sun (as long as the sewage smell from the parking lot isn't lingering in the air). The gym is a typical hotel gym with a few cardio machine, some free weights & a few machine, just good enough for you to not hate yourself for pigging out of buffets & getting loaded on free beach while you were playing black jack the night before.\n\nLast thing to mention is all MLife\/MGM owned casino now charge for parking even if you're a hotel guest, so expect a $13 charge everyday for valet, & $10 for self parking.
