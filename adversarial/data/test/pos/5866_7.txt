It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.\n\nOf course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). \n\nHere are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:\n\nRooms\n * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian\n * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft\n * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more\n * For either, about $40 upgrades to a Suite with a View\n * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury\n * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft)\n * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites\n * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style\n * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone\n * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals\n * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee\n\nDining\n * 15 Fine Dining ($$$$) restaurants are tempting\n * Recommend CUT, Bouchon, Delmonico, AquaKnox, or SUSHISAMBA\n * Over 20 casual eateries will fit more budgets\n * Try Public House or B&B Burger & Beer\n * Grand Lux Cafe is open 24 hours\n * The Venetian has several bars to get your drink on\n\nShows & Activities\n * Tao Beach & Night Club is THE club at Venetian\n * The Race & Sports Book is uniquely open 24\/7\n * Rock of Ages musical (Tix: $69-$167)\n * Panda! features Chinese Acrobats at Palazzo ($68-$158)\n * Lipshtick rotates female stand-up comedians ($75-$120)\n * Human Nature has Australians singing Motown ($74-$118)\n * Get married (if you must) at one of their Wedding locations\n * The DaVinci Exhibit was a waste of $27.50 to see replicas\n * Canyon Ranch SpaClub isn't cheap, but you're on vacation\n * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out\n\nShopping\n * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal\n * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri\/Sat)\n * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end\n * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights\n * Some will like Jimmy Choo, Coach, DvF, or Michael Kors\n * It'Sugar is always sweet\n * Many of the restaurants are located along the Grand Canal\n\nParking & Location\n * Near the North end of the Vegas Strip by its sister, The Palazzo\n * Across from the Mirage and Treasure Island\n * Free parking is in an 11-story parking garage\n * Follow signs from main Venetian entrance\n * Valet is easier sometimes if you don't mind waiting & hate walking\n\nThe Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices.
