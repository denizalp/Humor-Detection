My daughter and I stopped over here on our way home from a meeting. It is located in a small strip mall near Drake Road in Bethel Park. The place appeared cozy and the counter lady was very friendly. In addition to coffee and tea they serve some small prepared foods, Kind bars, and various pastries along with drinks in a refrigerator.\n\nI opted for the Hazelnut blend while my daughter choose a vanilla latte. They have a sign that says cash preferred. I'm good with that since I normally pay that way.  There is a jar for tips right alongside and they offer free WiFi. Prices are very reasonable and cup size is shown on the counter before you order.\n\nSince we were full from lunch we decided to skip the food. The place is very small but does have comfortable couch seating as well as table seating. I really enjoyed my Hazelnut blend and my daughter enjoyed her vanilla latte. She had to wait a bit for it to cool down since it was especially hot but she was pleased with it.\n\nNoticing they have a rewards program I asked the counter lady about it. She said there was an \"app\" for that. Sorry, I don't do apps unless I visit a place on a regular basis. I asked for a card. She gave me one stamp. She explained that even though I purchased two coffee items the stamp is once per day and not once per item. \n\nCourse everything is made for takeout as well. It was a nice visit and may stop by again next time I find myself in the area.
