Green forest is this nondescript restaurant in a nondescript building on a nondescript hill, just off Rodi Road in Penn Hills.\n\nBut like a geode, it's this lovely, expensive gem of a place that's totally worth the price of admission.  Why?  ...because THEY HAVE THE MEATS!!\n\nCow, pig, chicken, turkey, lamb, shrimp and lobster.\n\nI see your Arby's commercials and I raise you unlimited rashers of slow-cooked tastiness fit for a king - if that king was a sharp-toothed T-Rex.\n\nMy first trip was the \"amateur\" side, but even that was impressive, with piles of lobster claws in (very little) rice, colossal shrimp, prosciutto, sopresetta and a full salad bar.\n\nNext was the non-stop meat round and it was awesome.  Steaks, roasts, sausage, some phenomenal lamb chops, lots of items wrapped in bacon...\n\nFunniest thing heard all day:  \"Sir, would you like some rotisserie thick-cut bacon, fresh out of the flames?\"  Why yes, yes I would!  #omnomnom\n\nService was excellent, food was awesome and the Only thing i would avoid is the bitter-tart passion fruit mousse (yecch!), which obliterated the nice meat mojo I had going at the end.  Other than that (and the whole nondescript thing), my meal was great as it was the last two times I was here.
