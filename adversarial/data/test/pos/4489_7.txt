I had the chicken sandwich, which was good but not amazing. I thought they could have put more arugula and less chicken salad on the bun. The fries were pretty good as well; crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. Also the beer selection did not have as many specially craft beers as I anticipated. So definitely don't expect a ton of variety.\n\nThe thing that bugged me the most was the service. After ordering our food at the cashier, we sat down at a table. It took about 10 mins for a waitress to come around to ask us if we wanted anything from the bar. My boyfriend ordered a bottled beer, which then took her 15 mins to bring back to us. By then we were almost halfway finished with our food. She asked if we wanted to keep our tab open or closed, we closed it, & she left us the beer check. It was not long after that we put down our card, but it took her FOREVER to pick up the check. Mind you that this place was not busy and our waitress was just standing around doing nothing. We left the check in clear view on the table but somehow she walked passed our table 5 times before picking it up. \n\nIt just amazed me how mindless she was and inattentive to our table, when the place was not even busy. I do admit that this was a one time thing and I can only say this occurred by one waitress so maybe everyone else is great, but this was just my experience that I had.
