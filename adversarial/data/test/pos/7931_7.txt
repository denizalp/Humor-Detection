2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     47\/100\n\nI had no idea these palm size burgers existed till I watched Harold and Kumar in the theater, 10+ years ago! Because of that movie (one of my fave movies btw), I have also been a fan of White Castle before trying those bite size burgers. \n\nLuckily, before they opened up shop in Vegas, I had to settle for the frozen squares at the local market. \n\nNow that we are lucky to have our own White Castle, I finally got to try them! \n\nI was not disappointed. I knew what to expect and I can say that they taste a little better than the frozen - microwave version I tried before. Still a fan. \n\nIt's convenient if you're walking the Strip. Once you pass this, you're gonna wanna pop in and grab a couple to continue your walk.  \n\nThere are toppings available. Try them if you haven't before. Prices are reasonable. Keep in mind, it's on the Strip. \n\nThe only thing missing was a photo booth with Harold and Kumar! haha John Cho..... :-)
