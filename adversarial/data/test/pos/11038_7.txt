Bright Pearl is just fine for dim sum.  You go with friends early in the morning, chill out, have some tea, shoot the shit and have a little something to start off the day.  It's more social than anything and because of this I like Bright Pearl 'cause it's so Chinatown and it's been the same since it converted from a Chinese funeral parlour into a restaurant.  And despite it's macabre history the naturally lit space with those high ceilings and brightly strewn Chinese lanterns and bedazzled dragon motif that adorns the elevated stage area makes for a space that is both elegant and wonderfully tacky.  It's fun and unpretentious and the service is fine and the food is fine.  I too have noticed that the variety has decreased the last few times I've been there but I end up just ordering it from the kitchen.  There's better and there is worse but I come here 'cause I've always come here for dim sum and I probably always will.  Go with chatty friends and leave room for sweet tofu dessert.\n\np.s.  and it is haunted.  If you're really, really still you can hear the faint whisperings of Cantonese voices urging you to go ahead and order the braised chicken feet 'cause it's not dim suuuuuum weeeeeethout cheeeeeeeckin feeeeeeet....ooooooOOOOOooooo
