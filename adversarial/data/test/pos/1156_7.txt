This is the number one place to have a drink for a spectacular view of Vegas. We have even gone to Mix with residents of Vegas and they were shocked at the magnificent night time views. Service is good and the drinks are fun. It's not cheap but it shouldn't be with that view. Also-check out the bathrooms, they are a trip ( I have only heard about the ladies room). You HAVE to go for the evening view at least once.\n\nThe only reason I did not assign 5 stars is the following: It was a chilly night and Mix does have kerosene heaters near the tables. When we asked the manager to light ours up, he said he could not because there was not enough fuel to keep it lit though the entire night and he needed it  later for the \"club crowd.\" That is a bad answer-At $16-$20 a drink you can buy more fuel. He did come through with some blankets for the women in our group though.
