Amazing!  4 stars all the way....\n\nI want to start by saying I wanted to try this place because of a yelp review from a pretty decent yelp reviewer.\n\nFantastic!!!! This place is legit, one of the best hole in the wall joints in Henderson.\n\nNo reservation required, just walk in and order up. Ordering the Clam chowder and the Steak Bomb I was pumped to get some of this grub into Maa Belly. These did not disappoint, the Clam Chowder was hands down freakin amazing, I nearly licked the cup it was that good! As for the Steak Bomb, Boom! This steak sandwich was out of this world, with great steak chunks  and fresh bread I was pretty blown away!! If Your hungry and want a suggestion, get these two!\n\nNow where my experience got even better was the customer Service. Yeah the food was amazing but the service was outstanding. I had my 1 year old son with me, they had nice clean high chairs for him and played with him a little!!! Not only that, they made him some mash potato and blended up some veggies for him, it wasn't on the menu but they didn't even hesitate to make him something as well!!!! I believe this is real customer service, the staff were so nice to us that I would recommend them to anyone and everyone.\n\nI really hope they open in Summerlin, if they do I maybe there 6 out of 7 days a week. It's pretty close to the 215 for anyone coming from Summerlin.\nThey have a East Coast Eats app. If you want to get stamps or send pictures etc grab it from your cell phone App Store!!\n\n\nGreat Service and amazing food \n\nA strong 4 stars
