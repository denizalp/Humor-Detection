Buyer beware: if you're looking for a company for SEO or any other website services, DO NOT use this company! My company signed a contract with Fasturtle with one of our sites ranking (at the time) #1 on Google. Two years and tons of money later, one of our websites has fallen off of Google completely and our other site that was #1  had slipped down to the fifth or sixth page (we were blamed for this, by the way).No proactive actions were taken when the rankings began to slip. We received no warnings when suspicious links were found (by us!) on our websites, and one of my sites was down for two days until I had a customer call and inform me it wasn't working. Fasturtle had the audacity to charge us for fixing the site that went down on their watch! Every single time we had a problem on our websites, we were the ones to locate it. Their \"customer service\" (that's an oxymoron) is horrendous; turnover at that place is insane which says a lot (I must have dealt with at least three different \"sales reps\" for our account) and I had countless ignored emails and calls that went unreturned. We have since dropped the disservice of this company and enlisted the services of another company and, despite the mess left by Fasturtle, are on our way back to our former high ranking. Now working with a proficient company, I can see just how incompetent the services of this company really were- I don't know what they did with our money besides let bad links on the sites, not update anything, and ignore our calls. I'm just relieved we don't have to deal with these people anymore, and I strongly caution anyone considering their services to look elsewhere.
