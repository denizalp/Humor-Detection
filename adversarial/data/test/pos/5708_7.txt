I saw this doctor and he told me I was a good candidate for surgery he didn't agree with the MRI report after looking at the images but told me that I'd have to quit smoking for 6 weeks before you would even consider doing surgery and the surgery he explained to me was like no big deal he's done plenty of them so I went home and you tube it the surgery and was horrified. I've called for several weeks to get my or his report sent to another neurologist and nothing they say they're going to send it they never do they suck. I am so sick of the medical field and the people that work with them that they are so incompetent they can't even fax the report. And if you have Medicare you are really in trouble.\n\nJust got my report from the doctors office half of the report what is correct any other part was made up I hate Doctors they lie in there reports all that schooling and they can't write a correct report
