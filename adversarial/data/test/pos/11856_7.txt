The b\/f and I just had a fabulous Saturday breakfast here and I couldn't wait to review it.  Coming straight from the gym, we were both famished and ready to eat.  From the time we walked in the door, Emma, our waitress provided the friendliest customer service we've had in a long time.  She greeted us as we sat down, cleaned off the table that she noticed was a bit dirty, attempted to fix our wobbly table, and when that didn't work moved us to a table for four even though there were only the two of us.  After perusing the menu, customers order at the counter and then the food is brought out.  As others have stated, this is a small place, so we were lucky to snag a table right before 10:00am.  There was a steady line of customers when we were there, but several were to-go orders.  \nI had the fried chicken and waffles, which is a big waffle served with 4 fried chicken wings.  The fried chicken was piping hot, tasty, and not greasy at all.  Using my hands to dig in, this was not a neat meal by an means, but it was good.  Emma checked on us often as did the other waitress there.  If you are a fried chicken fan, I heartily recommend you bookmark Gritz Cafe for amazing food and service.
