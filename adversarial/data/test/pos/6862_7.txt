I just need to tell the story of my short visit to this casino. It was a rainy Saturday which is rare here in Las Vegas. We enter the casino and it is definitely a local's place. It was divey, which most locals places are. The first machine we go to, we are unable to get it to accept our money. We play a different machine, then try to cash out and the ticket gets stuck inside. We turn on the service light and wait, and wait, and wait. After about 10 minutes with no one coming, I go to look for someone. I approach a worker who was emptying the trash, and asked her if there was a slot tech available. She stares off into the distance and says nothing. After a long awkward moment of silence I just leave and start looking elsewhere. I finally find a slot tech and he removes our ticket. We start to walk through the casino, and we see a myriad of trash cans lined up on the floor. They were catching water leaking from the ceiling! I picked a machine to play, then decided not to when water starts to drip onto my head.\nConsidering it was raining inside we decided to leave so we go to the cash out machine. The machine paid us out in small bills, and it spit them all over the floor! The tray must've been missing on the front of the machine. So we crawled around on the floor picking up multiple bills and laughing all the while at the crazy silliness of this place.
