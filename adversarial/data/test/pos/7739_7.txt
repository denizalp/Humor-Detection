Overpriced, odd service, and odd atmosphere.  That sums this place up for me.\n\nIt looks amazing and classy, but the decor combined with the usual lack of business makes this place feel uncomfortable to me.  Our entire group didn't feel comfortable to talk and be merry.  It felt like a library.  \n\nThe food wasn't anything special.  It wasn't bad, but for a place that sells $10+ apps and dinners that hit upwards of $30, it's not worth it.  The food isn't anything new or creative.  It represents a whole slew of things I've seen everywhere else.\n\nService was slow and kind of awkward.  The server seemed to act like he was put out by having to serve us.  It was almost like he wanted us to hurry up and leave.  If that's the case, tell the kitchen to speed it up because we killed a bottle of wine before the apps even showed up.  \n\nIf I didn't have so many other options available, I would probably bump this up a star, but compared to what's around, this place just doesn't make the cut for me.
