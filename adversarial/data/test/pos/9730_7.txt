This place has REALLY cool stuff, but who can afford it, seriously!!! Wow. I want to buy stuff here but the prices boggle my mind! What are you crazy people buying here?\n\nGreat for window shopping though. \n\nAmazing novelty items. Barbapapa Medival playset?!?! Hell yeah! And Pacman Moleskins too.\n\nIf I was a rich hoarder I'd be all over this place!
