Wahlburgers has been on my bookmark list for quite sometime now, they have a few locations here in Cali, I am a BIG fan...\"What's up Marky Mark\"!?! LOL  We ventured over to the location on the strip.  I wasn't in the mood for a burger so I ordered the fries and mac n cheese.  Oh my goodness, the mac n cheese knocked my socks off even considering they put the bread crumbles on top that I typically do not like, and the fries tasted really fresh.  The people sitting next to us ordered a burger and said it was hands down the best burger that they have ever had!  I can't wait to try the burgers! *salivating*.
