Love this store, I usually go here for their snack section. The first time I visited till date the store maintains the same atmosphere. \n\nIts clean, people are helpful and the varied selection they have is amazing. My friend first introduced me to their ice cream bars (Raspberry and vanilla cream) and its my favorite. I always go there to get some. This time tried their short bread and crispy cookies. Oh man! they are heaven I highly recommend these two snacks. \n\nThe price is a little on the higher side but the products are pretty good.
