What can I say? I'm cheap!\n\nAll at the last minute I decided I wanted to do a Staycation on Memorial Day Weekend in Las Vegas. Good luck finding anything, let alone anything for a decent price the day before the weekend right? In comes... Fiesta Henderson!\n\nWith a room, and two movie tickets, and two passes to the buffet for $119.95 my husband and I were off to our cheap-o hotel fun time. \n\nSure the casino isn't great. The movie theater is, well, a movie theater, and the buffet, eh, the buffet - eh. \n\nBUT - you can't beat the price, even if the room was less than spectacular, but at least it was clean!\n\nThe pool too, was clean, and quiet, save for a few kids in the pool - and, sigh, no bar. But hey, my husband and I just brought champagne and chilled it in our ice bucket in the room, and a 6-pack of beer! We snuck our drinks into the pool hidden in normal old cups, and guess what? No one noticed. \n\nDisappointments - the lights in our room were very touchy, and randomly went on and off. And - no room service, so no breakfast in bed! *womp womp*\n\nPros - Great package deal and great discount for military. \n\nIf you want to do it on the cheap, here's the place to do it!
