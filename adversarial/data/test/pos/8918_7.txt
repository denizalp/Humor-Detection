This would have been a nice experience had our order not been made incorrect, our meals actually arrive at the same time, and had the food been made that day.  Supposedly this place has been around for a decade, however it struggled with only four seated tables.\n\nI ordered two empanadas in leu of an entree and my boyfriend had ordered the curried chicken.  After multiple, \"the chef is working on your food right now,\" excuses I was presented with a single beef empanada, and he, the curried chicken.  As a vegetarian this presented a problem, and I was still missing an empanada.  Roughly 10 minutes later I received my correct empanadas.  They seemed a little dry to me, but at this point I was too hungry to care.  It wasn't until we had finished eating that the waitress came to our table with bottles of sauces and say, \"Oh I guess you didn't need any sauce!\" \n\nThe curried chicken was floating in about 1\/4 cup of broth which he used to rehydrate the dry rice that still held the form of the measuring cup it was scooped with.  Chef Mike (microwave) obviously reheated the rice and beans.  The rice was crunchy, and the beans were dry and split.  The salad took up half the plate, and was simply pico de gallo on a bed of iceberg lettuce.  He would have been happy with this for lunch, served on a paper plate, from a food truck for $7.  It did not pass as a $13 entree item.     \n\nItems ordered: Patacones, Bean & Spinach Empanadas, Curried Chicken, Jamaican Iced Tea, Caipirinha
