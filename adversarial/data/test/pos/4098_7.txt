Nothing like doughnuts and coffee to start the new year! I love that Krispy Kreme paired with UberEATS  so they will deliver them right to your door! My fianc√© and I are always talking about how we would love these donuts but there isn't any close to our house so we were thrilled when we heard of this option. \n\nWe got a dozen original glazed doughnuts this morning and they were still warm, very fresh, and a lot of glaze. They were amazing and pair great with coffee. Very addicting, it's hard to not eat the whole box! Nothing compares to the original glaze Krispy Kreme.
