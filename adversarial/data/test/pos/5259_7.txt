In spite of a name that sounds like an ABBA song, Me Va Me is a super popular Israeli restaurant.\n\nThis place is so popular that on the Saturday night we visited, our party of four had about a 45 minute wait (despite being told it would be 30 minutes). Unfortunately, seats are few and far between in the waiting area so we ended up in the drafty alcove between the front door and the second door to the restaurant. The host didn't call names to our area so my mother in law had to stand by herself next to the host stand for 45 minutes while we stayed with my grandmother in law (is that even the correct term?) who needed to sit.\n\nMy husband's family is such a fan of this place that his grandfather's 90th birthday celebration with 50 people was held here.\n\nWe shared an appetizer combo ($11) with our choice of five apps. We chose hummus for two of those (who can go wrong with \"yummus\"?), baba ganoosh, fried eggplant, and a Turkish eggplant\/roasted red pepper dish I'd never heard of (something like \"metahba\"). I wasn't a fan of the whipped texture of the hummus but it had good flavor. The baba g was only OK. The big winner was the fried eggplant, which didn't taste fried - more like a cold eggplant roasted red pepper dish. The metahba was very similar to the fried eggplant and was also good. My husband who previously was an eggplant scaredy-cat because of its texture was an eggplant convert after the appetizers.\n\nBetween the apps and complimentary plate of pickles, I was almost full by the time my entr√©e came. I had a simple plate of pierogies ($8) from the appetizer menu. They came with carmelized onions and sour cream (and maybe apple sauce?), and were tasty, though way too oily. My husband had a chicken skewer ($12?) that was ridiculously huge. He made his way through about 1\/3 of it. I think he preferred the apps to his entree, as did I.\n\nThe portions were huge and I took half the remaining appetizers with me to our room. I ate them again many times for late night snacks and breakfasts.
