Definitely my \"go to\" store in Las Vegas. The owner Sonny is usually there to steer you in the right direction and offer expert advice. In the rare case he is out of the shop he has plenty of competent employees around to help out with any questions. Great selection of healthy fish and Corals in a nice clean shop, cant go wrong with Aquatic Treasures!
