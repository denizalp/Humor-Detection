Let me preface this by saying I am in no way a ramen connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination. I don't know the difference in the size of the noodle or whatever else people gripe about. I don't care who owns the place or who's making my soup, shoot there could be Siamese cats back there whipping it up for all I care. All I know is this is by far my favorite place I have tried in town. I thought Monta was way overhyped and the broth was so salty, I did like Ramen Sora, but this place takes the cake! Or should I say noodle. I tried the XO Tantanmen and it was so good! I've been thinking about it ever since. Our waiter was really nice, our waters never fell below half empty. The gyoza was really good as well. I can't wait to go back.
