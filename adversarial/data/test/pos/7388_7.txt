I try NOT to go here for dancing, but they are GREAT for karaoke.  Huge songbook, good drinks and entertaining hosts.\n\nBut the dance area is what kills the star rating.\n\nI typically get there early with a large group who wouldn't go anywhere else... before nine to avoid a cover for the men in the group and the drinks are cheap.  The bad part... bad music until like 10 or 11.\n\nUntil then, you are stuck with people in their golden years listening to 70's music (which I absolutely DESPISE, thankyouverymuch) and wondering why the hell you agreed to show up so early.\n\nThen... as midnight comes on, it turns into a meat market and you have to be protected by your date in every move you make. \n\n\"I JUST need to go to the bathroom, and I'm a flipping lesbian.  I know you don't believe me and you now suddenly believe you can convert me, but tough cookies sweetheart, now back off.\"\n\nGo for the karaoke... not the dancing.
