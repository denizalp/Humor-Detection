We came here on no-meat Friday and the parking lot was packed even for early dinner. This is located next to The Orleans. From outside, it looks like your old plain ordinary bar but when you get to the dining area, it's cozy. It's like being at your Irish grandma's home - yup, I'm making that up...I obviously don't have an Irish grandma. The seats are plush.\n\nThey have Guinness, Smithwick's, Kilkenny, Harp...and imports such as Chimay, Crabbie's Ginger Beer and Wells Banana Bread Beer. Yum!\n\nAll of us ordered the fish and chips. It was sooo good. One of the best I've had ever. Huge portions too. The batter is perfectly light and crisp. The fries weren't seasoned so, season away. The fish and the fries weren't greasy and gross. \n\nWe also ordered the sticky toffee pudding but I didn't get to try it - I'd have to come back after lent.
