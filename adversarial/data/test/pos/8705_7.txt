The dogs seem sad. Poop in cages. \nThe girl helping us is so kind and sweet which is refreshing all things considering. \nAnd the puppies are WAY WAY over pricedâ€¼\n\nA very unfortunate thing just happened, my 15 year old Kalina just got bit by the Great Dane that is so long over due to be taken home, \"she is angry, she needs to go to a home already, she is too big for her cage.\" My heart is aching right now for my daughter who has teeth marks on her wrist and for this dog needing a forever home already.
