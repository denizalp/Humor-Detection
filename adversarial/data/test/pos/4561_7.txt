Just Delicious \n\nI have worked in Phoenix for many years, and only recently visited The Original Weinberger Restaurant. How did I miss this place for so long?  The original Wineburger Restaurant has a really casual atmosphere. You can sit at the bar and watch burgers being cooked on the grill, or watch one of the many TVs throughout the restaurant.\n\nWineburger offers an extensive menu, there is a lot to choose from, there is something to satisfy everyone's craving, including kid-friendly options. On this visit I ordered the classic cheese wineburger and kettle chips. The burger and chips arrived quickly. The burger was served pipping hot, with melted cheddar cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and pickles, on a toasted bun. After my first bite into this burger,  I realized, it must be the red wine that makes these burgers insanely juicy. I have to admit, this was one of the best burgers I've ever had.\n\nSo if you're in the mood for mouthwatering burgers and a whole lot more visit the Original Wineburger Restaurant and bring your appetite. Easy location to find with plenty of parking, and friendly and accommodating staff.
