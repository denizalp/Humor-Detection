Holy guacamole this place. I'm pretty sure whatever McD's puts on their fries to make them irresistible, this place has taken that substance and perfected it for their chicken. \n\nHubbs got the fried chicken with 3 sauces, mac & cheese for the side (as did I, cause I mean cmon who's NOT gonna get that bowl of pure bliss?). We also ordered a funnel cake and that was pretty darn good too. \n\nI got the baked chicken, but I wish I'd just gone ahead and gotten the fried (damn me and my new healthy lifestyle initiative!). The baked chicken was good, but it was too salty for my taste. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to salt?\n\nAlso, for a chicken strip place, they make some pretty legit Thai iced tea. Who'd have guessed? \n\nAlso met some lovely people at the joint. Good food, good company :)
