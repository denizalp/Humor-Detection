This may be the best Tibetan food in Parkdale! I discovered this place when another Tibetan restaurant in the area recommended that I go here to try the deep-fried momos. Yay, Tibetan camaraderie! \n\nThe deep fried momos were OK, but I think I liked the steamed ones better. The spicy cauliflower appetizer and spicy potato fries were AMAZING! The fries were like Tibetan poutine, in the best sauce you can imagine. The cauliflower was just lightly fried and the perfect texture, with fantastic spices. Oh my GOD, this food. \n\nThe Norling chicken, my main, was good but out-shined by the apps. \n\nI will be back!\n\nThe total came to $60 for three apps, one shared main, and four glasses of wine, including tax and a decent tip. There were leftovers that I brought home to a fellow momo lover.
