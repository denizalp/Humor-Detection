Uncle Sam wants me and I want Uncle Sam's!!!! Yuuu-uuum!\n\nThe all-american sub is absolutely, by far my favorite sub in the world. The bread is great and it is toasted to absolute perfection. I can't even count how many times I have oredered it and it always comes out the same way and never disappoints! The cheese steak sub is also really good and their pizza and wings are pretty awesome too!!!\n\nI usually get it to go, but if you are planning on stopping in, they always have sporting events on TV which is pretty cool. It's kind of a small dining area, but it's fun if you are in the mood for a sports bar atmosphere.
