You can stumble into this theater with little to no static at all. Your lush ass and friends can literally walk into a bar found downstairs.. some Irish bar.. walk out.. climb some stairs and tada! Look out for the kids (depending on the time) so you won't anger some parents with your disorderly conduct considering there is an arcade right next door. Hey you can play some Burning Rubber as you wait till the movie starts if you're up for some juvey fun! \n\nWe were coming from Chinatown and mapping theaters and this was the easiest to find. Two types of chairs available. Some lean far back while others are more upright. Good luck. \n\nGreat sound. I dug it.
