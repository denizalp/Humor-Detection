I visited this aeronautical wonderful wonder tonight for some post-prandial libations after a party in Yorkville. After two $20 cocktails, and an over-dressed crowd that made me feel more shame than a fanny-pack salesman, I retreated in hopes of somewhat cheaper cocktails at The Pilot. \n\nFor those that don't know, the key to The Pilot is heading skyward to their impressive third-floor rooftop patio. It's a well-shaded and cordial space (much like an airplane) with plenty of seating and a splendid \"atmosphere.\" (See what I did there?)\n\nTonight however we were determined to stay in-of-doors; to avoid the mysteriously bone-chilling summer wind that was winding it's way through Yorkville (a metaphor for the trappings of wealth perhaps? Do meteorological phenomena even work in metaphor?). Our foursome grabbed an uncleared table in the back, and snagged some drinks.\n\nThey have a decent draught selection here, with beers in the $7-8 range. Bottles were available also. Our evening was OK but trying to get our bill was harder than selling fanny-packs post 1993. Our waitress disappeared (I actually think she actually enrolled in and attended a night class) and we spent a good thirty minutes hypothesizing various drink and dash scenarios and debating the ethical implications thereof. \"Do we leave after 45 minutes? One hour?\" She eventually showed up and we settled our table like civilized human beings. That's the aeronautical way. \n\nObligatory Title Pun: This PILOT might be on auto.\n\nMenu Readability: Like a cloud. Whatever that means.\n\nNeed to mention: Washrooms are all the way downstairs.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I will leave a table after 60 minutes of server neglect. Be ye warned Toronto.
