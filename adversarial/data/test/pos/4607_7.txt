Nice and pretty hotel and casino.\n\nWe didn't stay here, but we visited the casino. It was nice, airy, and smells wonderful. However, the security guard at the front entrance was a jerk. It wasn't a busy night, he stood right at the entrance, we were kinda lost. We asked how to get back to Las Vegas strip without circling around the building and his answered was \"GO OUTSIDE AND WALK ON THE SIDEWALK.\" Yeah...thanks, Aria. For future trips, I will spend my money elsewhere.
