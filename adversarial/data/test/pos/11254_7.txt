Finally got a chance to dine here and I was very impressed.  Every person from chefs to servers were friendly and attentive.\n\nThe Nobu influence is very unmistakeable.  We had the $55 omakaze tasting menu (#1 of 4 from what I'm told).  I see the others have already listed the dishes served with the omakaze #1 so I won't bore you with the details of each dish, I'll just make a couple comments.\n\nYellowtail with jalapenos and sashimi salad were excellent, very fresh fish.  Miso cod, I'm kinda over this dish (probably had it once too many times at Nobu) but they do execute it very well here.  Filet Mignon - unexpected but solid.  Mixed sushi - nice to be able to sample all their fish - I liked the hamachi and salmon a lot but absolutely loved the halibut.  I felt the cake and ice cream were uninspired and the cake not that good.  Also a little heavy to end that meal with.  \n\nYou must must must order the uni here.  If you've never had uni before this is the place to try it for your first time.  I thought I'd had good uni before but this was head and shoulders above the rest.\n\n$55\/man with two people tax and tip plus the order of uni it was $160, not cheap but half the price of Nobu Hard Rock and imo a much better meal.\n\nI will report back when I return for omakazes #2 - #4.  Hopefully soon.
