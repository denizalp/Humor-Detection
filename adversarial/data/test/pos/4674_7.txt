I'm knocking off a star from my previous review as I showed up with takeout and literally FINISHED MY MEAL before I was seen by a server.  And it wasn't busy.  When she arrived at my table she looked surprised that I hadn't gotten a drink yet and told me she \"thought I was just there to hang out.\"\n\nYeah, I was!  But I was hoping to hang out with a beer...
