This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.\nWalking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.\nOur server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!\nAfter Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?\nWell apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.\nThis review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!
