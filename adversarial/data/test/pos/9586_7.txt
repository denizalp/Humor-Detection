Nice spot located downtown and not far from some of the great spots. Upon entering we were greeted and seated. It wasn't crowded for a Saturday night. Hookah, lite bites, deserts, and fun themed drinks. This is a great spot to come if your not seriously hungry or after dinner for drinks and a fun looking desserts. Drinks average 11-20 per drink. You get 15 percent off of you check in on yelp. The drinks were okay the names were more interesting. Its a good place to try and I get the idea of what they are attempting or going for. This place is definitely about the look and appearance, but they miss the fine attention to detail which makes it okay. They have all female waitstaff that wear a red dress, but it looks like they just tossed it on.. some were wrinkled, etc. I get the impression they want this to be an upscale dessert bar. The desserts look amazing picture perfect.. The wait staff was attentive. The layout was cool, fun, and relaxed.   This is a place for the look so good for brining out of town guests or impressing someone, but taste and excellent service...nah.
