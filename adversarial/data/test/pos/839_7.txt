THIS is what shopping should always be like!  Friendly, knowledgeable sales staff that take good care of you!  Good quality, pretty bags, clothes and accessories all  arrayed in an easy-to-navigate store (even if you've been drinking, hahaha), what a lovely environment to lose some of those  winnings and be happy to do so!  \nThey even greeted me happily when I returned a couple martinis later (at least they ACTED happy, hmmmm, maybe they're actors and this is their day job, hmmmm)  and helped me pick out a birthday gift for my little princess. \nMichael Kors - love your designs, love your products, love your easy to navigate store (especially if you've had a couple cocktails!)  and love, really love your sales staff!
