So many options, tried essentially everything.. definitely had an augustus gloop moment. Wicked Spoon Buffet (greaterthan) Me... Buffet won..haha\n\nTotal food coma after me & the bro left. barely woke up in time to get ready to go to Jet. \n\nFood is yummy, lots of variety from chocolate dipped strawberry, to ceviche, lamb, prime rib, crab, sushi, pasta, etc. \n\nIf you're looking for a bomb buffet in on the strip go to the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Hotel is hella niiiiice too ;)\n\nmake sure you wear your comfy pants & shirt..LoL
