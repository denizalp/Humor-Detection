Marquee, a total chick fest this place is! Thanks to all you sexy girls for making Marquee my 3rd favorite club in Vegas.\n\nDuring day of course it is a pool club to go mingle in your swimsuits but come night, that's when it really goes down and definitely my fav time to hit it.\nGood or bad, say what you want but this nightclub is pimp! Hot women with little bitty sexy club dresses all around wow. The DJ talent performing here is tops and world renowned. The vibe is electrifying! It gets mad crowded with so much happening inside this place. \nParty central for all you singles on the hunt. A 5-star when it comes to clubs in sin city. Everyone looks well dressed, cool and ready to have fun. There are 3 rooms each with its own style of music...\n\nThe Library Room, has a pool table and lounge bar to chill away from the party madness.\nThe BoomBox room, solely for hip-hop\/top 40 music dance lovers.\nThe Main Room, which consists of many tables for bottle service along with the sound of house\/pop music thru the night. A modern upscale club, the lighting effects and go go hottie dancers add the right mix. \n\nTry to act discreet if you guys bring your GFs here cuz you will see hotter girls I kid you not and it can get you in trouble with your girl like it did with mine. I blame the beautiful honeys clubbing here for it. Yeah, Marquee can cause breakups so watch out.
