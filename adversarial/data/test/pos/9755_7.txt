Stumpled upon Cafe Zupas through a recommendation of a coworker.  I was so pleasantly surprised by so many things about this place.  First, I had the strawberry harvest salad and it was delicious!  I sort of did a -make your own -version of it because I didn't like all the ingredients that came in it and so - no problem- I had them add a few others instead.  The dressing they used was a sort of strawberry vinaigrette and it was really terrific.  \n\nThey have a huge selection of salads, soups and sandwiches.  Today I stuck with the soup and salad but would definitely try a sandwich at my next visit.  The soup I had was the cauliflower and it too was good. \n\nOne thing that I really appreciated at this location was the charging stations set up so you can eat while charging any phone\/tablet device.  I thought this was very clever!\n\nService was great and the restaurant was brightly and cheerfully decorated.  I can't wait to go back and will add this to my arsenal of favorite lunch places.
