I made the mistake of coming to this office. The name states Canyon Medical Center but it's actually an urgent care. I live in Henderson and for some reason this business popped up and I thought it was on SOUTH Rainbow Dr. It's not, it's all the way NORTH. I didn't want to be rude and cancel my appointment so I went. \n\nI called to make an appointment for a physical and lab work (so I can get clearance for a surgery next week.) The receptionist that answered the phone wasn't sure if the doctor could give me a physical? She had to ask. I would assume that by working in the doctors office- she would know. Anyways, no big deal. I went in and the wait wasn't too long. \n\nLobby\/waiting area is decent and clean. The restroom does not have toilet seat covers. When I was called back and waiting for the doctor in the private room-it looked like it needed a new face lift. Wall paint was peeling and faded. \n\nI had to get lab work done so the receptionist gave me paperwork. She failed to give me the sheet with all the locations so I had to ask for it. (Guess she assumed I knew where the labs were located?) I picked a lab that was fairly close to the office and it had shut down! So double check the list - some may be closed for good. \n\nTwo days later, I have a follow up appointment with the doctor. I called ahead to make sure the office had received my chest x-ray, and ekg and they confirmed.  They're already running 30 minutes late. I get called back and wait another 30 minutes.  Doctor M was so rude to me. He told me he was missing my EKG and I told him that they did in fact receive and he continues to argue with me. But then 10 seconds later, he finds it on his computer. Guessing the lab screwed up because they haven't received all the panels yet. \n\nIf anyone has a good vegas doctor please let me know. Everyone I have gone to so far have been incompetent at doing their jobs.
