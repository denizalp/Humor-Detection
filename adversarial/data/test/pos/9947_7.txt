We live in Medlock district, within walking distant to Zookz.  Watched it come up and intended to give it a try early on but didn't.  One Sunday morn, on a walk with my older girl and with the baby in her mei tai, I realized they would be open by the time we finished.\n\nWhen I arrived they had JUST opened for the day.  I was a sweaty mess and dragging my girls in.  The owner Carole was working and she was a VERY gracious host.  Explained the concept, asks us to make adjustments as desired and mentioned the kale & mandarin orange salad that is given with catering orders when I inquired for my office.  I got a few sandwiches to go so hubby and son could try them out as well.  She packed everything nicely for my walk home, poured the drink for me AND tossed in a sample of the salad.\n\nBTW: Kale isn't high on my 'delish' meter.  However, this is now my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SALAD hands down.  I actually drool at little whenever I think about it (darn it, there I go again...).\n\nWe have now gone a few more times and each sandwich has been warm, moist, toasty, crisp, flavorful and so wonderful it makes my husband smile to think about it.  One of our top 5 eateries and I personally LOVE her backstory (check out the About portion of their website).\n\nStart-up businesses are rough.  We have a lot of great local-owned food establishments in the valley.   I truly wish her the best.  She's got a few more fans and regular customers from my house!
