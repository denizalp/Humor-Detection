I spend way, way too much money here. Every. Single. Workday. It's actually kind of embarrassing, since I am clearly not an investment banker and I could very well make my own salad.\n\nBut it's so easy and so healthy! I've never created the same salad twice. Today it was quinoa, sweet green peas, beets, avocado, and cherries with a lemon ginger dressing.\n\nTomorrow I am thinking spinach with lentils, chicken, some sundried tomatoes and marinated mushrooms with red wine dijon. Yeah....\n\nThe soups are delicious, too, and there's always a gluten free option.\n\nSuggestions for the owners:\n\n- Learn feng shui. The sandwich line and the salad line converge like two angry rivers. This layout has people tripping and shoving their way to the cash registers then awkwardly dodging toward the exit from 11AM - 2PM.\n\n- They really should consider some loyalty cards for the $$ dropped.
