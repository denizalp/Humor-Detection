Ciao! I guess in this day and age, every Chinatown needs to have an upscale yuppie-grade Italian restaurant. Or rather, to frame it in frugal Asian terms, \"The most expensive food in Tong Yen Guy, and it ain't even Chinese food lah!\"\n\nHonestly, this is one of the oddest places to set up something like this. Whether Toronto's little East Chinatown is being subjected to the gentrification that has usurped many other of the city's ethnic neighborhoods and the nearby Leslieville\/Riverside areas is debatable. The presence of a place like Mr Ciao popping up in this furry neck of the urban woods only adds to the growing impression. In and of itself however, Mr Ciao (I wonder if this is meant to be an Italian pun of a stereotypical Chinese name like \"Mr Chow\"--you may notice a theme here as you keep reading this), does offer a closer-by pizza option for those living in the wealthier Riverdale community north of Gerrard St, who otherwise have to trek far to the Danforth for their local Italian pie fix--I cannot think of any other way for this gentrified gwai-lo establishment can justify surviving in this part of town, than perhaps the marketing factor of hoping to become a \"destination restaurant\" setting up shop in an unclaimed frontier of the city's food scene. It kind of reeks of this hipster-ironic, \"we are cool cuz we're in Chinatown\" cultural appropriation vibe. A very jarring, radically different presence in the 'hood indeed nonetheless.\n\nEven though I am heavily addicted to Italian food, I had little reason to investigate this new (just opened July 2014) place that took over space last held by a Pho restaurant (if there is one thing East Chinatown has a lot of, it is Pho houses). That is, until I had out-of-town guests down, children in tow, and the idea of driving to a big-box buffet or chain restaurant for a big dinner was inconvenient. So on a whim I chose to drag the whole extended family to Mr. Ciao instead, sight unseen, never bothering to read the menu nor knowing much else about it.\n\nIn addressing the got kids issue, I was surprised to see they have a kiddie play area in the very back of the place. Sure, it is very small and poorly lit, and stocked with a few toys and puzzles (and divided from the rest of the dining space with a salvaged \"Old Spaghetti Factory\" door), but at least they know the Riverdalians have kids that need to be accommodated.\n\nWalking in however was confusing, with no host to lead the way. From the front door you could swing a left for the bar, or make a straight down toward being deep into the back dining area. I don't know what interior designer came up with this idea whilst conceiving of the restaurant's hipster \"salvage chic\" decor--complete with exposed ceiling joists--but to me, this corridor is a pointless waste of space that could be better utilized for something like more indoor tables.\n\n\"Pizza\" screams from the overhead sign, and pizza is probably their strong suit. Unlike many of Toronto's recent upscale gourmet pizza restaurants' Neapolitanic wood-oven-baked pie approaches, Mr. Ciao flash-fry their dough. It gives their pies a nice crunch, but makes it hard to handle with a knife and fork.\n\nTheir pizzas hover in the $14-18 range. While you can't go wrong with the classic Margherita, they offer some interesting pizza choices. My favourite is the smoked salmon, which they claim they smoked on-site (not that it really matters to me). One of the couple menu items that make \"token gestures\" to acknowledging they are located, incidentally or otherwise, in this odd place called East Chinatown, is the $17 Peking Duck pizza. An interesting choice to try out indeed; the toppings on that is obviously Asian-influenced, like roast duck, char siu (Chinese BBQ pork) sauce, and wasabi peas. It's quite savory and meaty-tasting, but lacks a lot of meat. There's also the \"pizza egg rolls\" on the apps menu that I didn't go for.\n\nMy family were sampling their many pies and other things. But the prices, gee whiz! My teenage cousin had a rigatoni to himself, and whilst I am sure he enjoyed it, it in its small portion didn't look like something I would pay $17 for. Like I said, the most expensive food in East Chinatown... and it is not Asian food at all. Maybe I need to be a bike-riding left-wing pinko millionaire northern Riverdalian or a downtown startup entrepreneur yuppie to feel like it's worth it. (Then again, as a large party, this is much cheaper than doing a buffet dinner in a far away land.)\n\nThe service, while not snotty at all--actually it was very pleasant and accommodating; our server was even funny at times--is slow at best. Maybe it's just opening month jitters, but waiting a long while for our lukewarm first order to arrive with little attention paid to our table, boy am I not getting any hungrier.\n\nJoy geen Mr. Ciao! One thing I'll finish with though is they sure know how to be witty with the space they are working out of.\n\n{TTC: the 504, 505, or 506 to Gerrard
