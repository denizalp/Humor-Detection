this place is ok... not as good as the tea station in San Diego. \n\nmy friend and i order thai tea (watered down), squid jerky and chicken waaaangs!\n\n\nFood was good.. except the Thai Tea.. it didnt even look like thai tea... im sure thai tea is orange... tell me why theirs was cream color looking?
