I'm not much of a vegan\/vegetarian\/gluten-free type fan, but on a mission to eat \"healthier\", I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nHaving eaten other vegan salad concoctions before, they generally taste like eating paper.  I was pleasantly surprised at the salad.  Maybe it was the dressing, but adding sweet ingredients like sweet potato, beets and cranberries made a world of a difference.  A had a fleeting thought that I could eat this every day.  I also tried two of their savoury crepes.  They were OK.  The gluten free crepe was a bit on the crumbly side and I in general found it too sweet (and they also have sweet crepes).  Mind you, it's hard to make a good savoury crepe with out meat or at least egg.  I did like the fact they added avocado slices to the top.\n\nThe service is a little shoddy, but this is a vegan place I'd actually return to.  I'm starting to surprise myself.
