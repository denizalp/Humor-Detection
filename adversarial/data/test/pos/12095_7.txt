I've learned no matter who you have for TV, cox, Dish, CenturyLink...you're gonna get screwed & your bill will always be wrong. For me it comes down to how frustrated do I want to be when I call customer service?  DirecTV is the least frustrating bc I learned the trick to dealing with them. \n\nAs is the norm, my bill was (and still is), wrong. I call & can't get anywhere with them. Sometimes I call 2-3 times in a row...you'd think ONE of them would be able to tell me why my bill is wrong & fix it. Nope. So I gave up & filed a complaint with the BBB. It was then, & only then, the mistake was acknowledged & $400 in credits issued. Unfortunately, it was all absorbed on the next months bill. So I'll file another BBB complaint to get it fixed...again. \n\nBTW... My bill is supposed to be $75\/mo. Every month its over $175. And I don't order movies or PPV.
