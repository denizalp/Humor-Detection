I LOVE SAKANA! \n\nOkay, now that I've gotten that out of the way...this is my absolute favorite sushi spot here in the valley so I'm going to do a little yelp break down on this mofo:\n\nFOOD\/DRINK - Excellent sushi! It's fresh, it's tasty, and they've got a nice variety to choose from. Everything from raw to not so raw, and don't forget to look at the specials they have on the board by the bar! Some of my faves are the shrimp tempura rolls & the salmon dynamite. And if you come Sunday - Thursday, they run a customer appreciation special which is some of the specialty rolls except they're smaller & cheaper. I also love going here for the sake bombs - awesome price for the sake & beer you get, and they have a 50 cent appetizer special when you order it with Kirin. (man that sounds so good right about now...) Best of all, you can't really beat the amount of food you get for the price.\n\nSERVICE - The ladies that serve you here are so friendly and they're good at remembering faces when you come back. Yoshie is super nice and you can usually find her walking around to check on everyone, occasionally stopping to chat. I'm always sure to leave a nice tip for the wonderful service.\n\nCUSTOMERS - Weird, right? That I'd be adding a break down for the customers... But  I think they're pretty awesome too! Every single time I come here, I see a lot of regulars enjoying their food & having conversations with the staff. In a time where sushi joints try to be over the top & trendy, it's nice to come to a place that's low-key & you can have an actual conversation. Some people complain about having to wait for a table here, but obviously Sakana is doing something right if they've got people lined up by the door before they are even open! I will continue to come back again & again :)\n\n**On another note - they've recently expanded! Although, this is still a fairly small restaurant at least adding a few more tables will cut the wait time a little more :)
