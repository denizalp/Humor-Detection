I work in the service industry. I get that busy days suck and are stressful. But after the absolutely terrible service I experienced here, you bet your life I will never be returning and I will be telling everyone I know to stay away. It was my second time here, and my second time receiving HORRENDOUS service from the same server who really needs to check his attitude at the door. The first time, I chalked it up to him having a bad day, but now having had the misfortune of being served by him a second time, I feel compelled to write this review.\n\nWe were told that larger groups could make weekend reservations, and then discovered later that either we were lied to, or that another group adjacent to us had been given an exception. Not cool, either have an official policy that all guests are held to, or don't. We had a big group that were excited to spend money and time as we were promised, and despite the back room being very empty, members of our group were told there was no more room and turned away from the outset, even though we were happy to sit at separate tables, etc. When I did make it in to join my group, items that cost money came quickly(as they did last time) but I had to make the extremely simple request for WATER three times before the server(who I had to ask, nicely I might add, for water numerous times last time as well, before eventually giving up and never getting it) snapped \"when I get a second!\" and then went back to turning away more paying customers as is apparently his custom. Then a moment later he informed us that for a group our size, a tip would be included in the bill. Which is usually fair, except when you've turned away members of our group for no discernable reason, refused to bring water, been a snappy asshole about it, and generally acted as though we hadn't earned the privilege of you doing your damn job. More members of our group arrived at that time and were promptly again told there was no room, despite being able to see with their own eyes that the back room was less than half full. Last time our group were all able to be seated, but despite the room still being pretty empty, service was rude, slow, and snappy. \n\nAfter waiting a little longer, we decided to leave because we were unhappy, at which point we tried numerous times to attract our server's attention, all of which were met with abject ignorance. Finally one of our group members got up and went to find him and got the bill. We tipped him more than he deserved for reasons that still boggle me, and went a few doors down where we sat for hours and had great service. Such a shame, as Castle is a great place except for this one guy who has absolutely ruined our experience on two separate occasions. I won't be back.
