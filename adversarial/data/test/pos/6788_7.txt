I love french pastries, and this place let me eat as much of them as I wanted !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nMy mouth almost exploded from delight and my dress actually lost a button !\nThere is a great selection of cheeses and main courses. There are even king crab legs and all you can eat peel shrimp! \nIf you don't want to wait in line, go at the end of the period (so if it closes at 11, go at 10). They keep bringing out food until the last 30 minutes or so, so you're not left eating cold stuff. \nThey don't take plates away fast enough, though. Me and two other people at a table for four were barely able to Tetris everything on to fit. Also, a waiter has to bring you drinks. This also means that you can order alcohol :D Bon Appetite !
