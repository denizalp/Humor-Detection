I have a habit of checking Tripadvisor as well as Yelp for which hotel to stay in a city. This hotel came up number one with Tripadvisor so I just went with it since it was so last minute in our decision to travel to Phoenix. \n\nThe pros: morning breakfast daily, evening reception with some light food only Monday through Thursday,\nRooms are suites with separate bedroom, living area with full kitchen. For us ladies they had makeup remover wipes! Nice! Bathroom with toilet seat cover lid that doesn't slam down though the seat came loose! Lol no charge for parking or wifi. It was nice that when we were on our GC tour we were last to be picked up but first to be dropped off! \n\nThe cons: temperature in the rooms were hard to get it just right. Either you're too cold or hot. We only had a shower which was just right for me. If you're a large person it could be an issue! Shower temp was hot!!! By the time I figured it out it was my last day after 5 days! We got the second floor and I had no idea where the stairs were. Plus the people above us must have been a family of six. Lots of thump thump thump & more noises! Are they gone yet? Luckily we only heard that for two annoying full days. Thank goodness I was able to sleep good the last night at least! My hubby noticed that they do light cleaning on the weekends so he looked at the bed bc of my knee issues I had pillows and blankets every which way possible! Lol \nBe aware this hotel is thirty minutes away from the airport though it wasn't really an issue for us.\n\nAnd there you have it. I'm kind of surprised it was considered number one but next time we will probably stay closer to friends or check out Sedona and stay there a couple nights first. Ultimately we probably won't be back at this hotel though I rated it decently! Lol
