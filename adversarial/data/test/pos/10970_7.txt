This was one of our favorites when I lived in Chandler.  We decided to go back last Saturday.  He was craving their Irish version of a French dip and I *needed* the Jameson meatballs.  We got a table quickly and the waitress handed us menus.  Uh oh.  New menus.  \n\nCome to find out, the dip and meatballs weren't even on the menu anymore.  We were so disappointed that we left.  The waitress hyped the burgers...well, there are a ton of burger joints.  We wanted pub food and it's not available here anymore. We won't be returning unless they bring back old faves.
