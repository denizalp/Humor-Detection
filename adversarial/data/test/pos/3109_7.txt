The views of the susnet into the night make this outdoor patio venue breath taking. I recently had the opportunity to dine here for a large private party that consumed the whole patio. Very classy and romantic as the decor is fit for the perfect date night or party. Including a fire pit. We had a variety of food options served which were ok. I have to say I would come here more for the atmosphere then the food.
