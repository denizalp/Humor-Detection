I was so jazzed about trying out Stone Mad on our Thursday night date night (before catching a showing of Jurassic Park at Capitol Theatre) and even more jazzed that we had time to have the whole \"Stone Mad Experience\" - from patio, to food, to the crazy cool potty in the basement, to oh yes, bocce ball. It was lovely.\n\nFirst things first: parking. When we got there it was kinda early (6ish) and I noticed a number of spots out front on the street - some of them would have required parallel parking - but that's no big. We ended up parking in Capitol's lot (probably would not suggest this on busier nights because its rude to steal other people's spaces, but I figured we were headed over after dinner so why not).\n\nAs we sauntered down w.65th toward Stone Mad it was a scorcher - must have been at least 90 degrees and some ridiculously high level of humidity - so we decided to have a drink at the bar before grabbing something to eat on the patio. We entered through the front door - and as per usual I was confused, do I push, do I pull, do I bust through with both arms? It was like a swinging door type thing but with two sides and I must have looked like a fool trying to make my way through. Once inside there wasn't like a hostess, just the bartender, and a few people milling around the gorgeous warm toned wooden bar, the place just felt very authentic.\n\nThey had some happy hour pricing going on so I had an unauthentically Irish rum and diet and the boy toy ordered up some of his favorite, Strongbow. As we sat chatting at the bar I noticed other people were coming in and making their way to the back of the restaurant to seat themselves. To make truly sure it was a \"seat yourself\" type deal we asked the bartender and he said that was cool for inside but that outside there was probably someone to seat you. We picked up our drinks and headed back through the restaurant to make our way to the patio. We were greeted with even more beautiful, warm, and inviting woodwork with cozy little tables spread about. Making our way through the side entrance we headed out to the patio - greeted with a beautiful stone fireplace, plenty of stone seating, and a waterfall. We were given the option to seat ourselves and chose a nice shaded area toward the back of the patio. Was such a great atmosphere that even in 90 degree weather - it was still enjoyable. We then ordered a couple more drinks - a blueberry thrill for me (Stoli Blueberry vodka infused with fresh lemonade, shaken and trimmed with fresh blueberries) and another Strongbow for the man. With our drinks came a cup of pickles - a few tiny ones, a few regular slicked dill spears - I was loving it. Since we had a lot of time before the movie we decided to space out our meal and ordered the Stuffed Peppers (peppers stuffed with chorizo, served atop house made marinara sauce) as an appetizer - so yum. Once it came down to our dinner selections we decided to share and ordered up a Turkey Club (hand carved turkey, with bacon, Irish cheddar, havarti, lettuce, tomato, and mayo), the Famous Beef Brisket (slow roasted, hand-carved, and served on a dusted roll with horseradish sauce and au jus), some creamy mascarpone polenta, and home fries. Everything was delectable.\n\nAfter dinner we were dying for some A\/C so we paid our bill and made our way back inside to take another look around. Since it was pretty empty, we made our way to the back to check out the bocce court. I was super excited because nobody was playing and there was only one table of four seated back there so I wouldn't be embarrassing myself in front of too many people with my poor bocce ball handling skills. I asked one of the waitresses if we were allowed to just play, and she said \"of course!\" so we (drinks in hand, since the sign doesn't forbid it) headed into the court. Of course the boy and I had to google bocce ball rules (thank god for iPhones!) and after some reading up on it decided that we didn't have to be too technical about it. And in case you're wondering - you're supposed to take the smaller ball (the pallina) have someone throw it (underhand only) and then try to get the bigger balls (each team has four) closest to the pallina without touching it or hitting the back wall (alternating turns). Whoever ends up with the closest ball (or balls) to the pallina scores points. Long story short, the boyfriend ended up beating me (but not by much!).\n\nSince I had perused Yelp before coming down - I knew I had to check out the amazing downstairs bathroom before we headed down to the theatre. I just had to figure out how to get there first. So, we ended up asking the bartender and were told that \"its the coolest thing about the place\" and then pointed in the right direction (you get to the stairs through the front bar area to the left of the door that leads back to the dining area). The bathroom is as cool as the pictures make it look.\n\nAll in all, great Irish experience. We shall return. Sl√°inte, Stone Mad!
