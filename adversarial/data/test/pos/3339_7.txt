Came here for a Saturday lunch because an event left me hungry and there was no way I was going to wait until my evening reservation!\n\nThe service was impeccable... and the cute, young, waiter's wide grin made dining even more pleasurable.  ;)\n\nI started with the elephant garlic and crusty bread with olive oil.  I am such a garlic fan, and this was no exception.\n\nNext I had the beef short rib stew.  No joke, I practically LICKED the bowl clean.  No apologies here.  It was THAT good.  I was not sure about the egg at first, but the combination of textures and flavors was amazing.  \n\nTopped lunch off with strong pink cocktail and VOILA... \n\nYes, I will be back.  In fact... Friday's looking good for me.  Anyone want to join?
