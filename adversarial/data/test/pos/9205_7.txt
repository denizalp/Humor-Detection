The food here is decent, I'm not a big fan of their recipes, but my family loves this place. Their shrimp and beef grill is well worth coming here since there isn't a restaurant that serves this dish in Vegas. Other than that, my family enjoys their Bun Bo Hue, Cha Goi and Banh Xeo here. This place is the new \"hot spot\" for Pho, but in my opinion their pho is not the best. The interior design is pretty nice and for a Vietnamese restaurant, it's surprising clean. The best part of this restaurant, is their service, you don't get good service and any other Vietnamese restaurants in town.\n\nUpdate: The Com Ga Roti is literally the best dish on their menu. I will come back for this dish!
