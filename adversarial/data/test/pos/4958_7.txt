Natashka, cheap? While you all know and love me for my expensive tastes (from Verbier to Cartier, I always say), even Natashka can enjoy some things that come cheap: Cheap liquor, cheap pornography... etc . But above all, Natashka loves things that should be expensive, but come cheap. Which leads me to the Stardust. I hate to admit it, but I booked Stardust purely due to $60. internet special. By the time I got off my plane, endured the horrendous LV traffic, and arrived at the front desk of the Stardust, it was midnight. I had an 8am appointment, and was ready to curl up in cheap hotel room and get beauty rest. I was too tired even to take much notice when the lady clerk informed me she had given me a suite. \"suite--\" i thought, \"what can a suite be like at the Stardust??\". I did not even make much effort to thank her. My opinion changed, however, upon entering the marble floored foyer of my suite, the bedroom of which was annoyingly bigger than my entire apartment at home... My day came to a very pleasant close, being massaged by the jets in my mammoth jacuzzi, and gazing through the panoramic windows over the carnivalesque Las Vegas strip. \n\nI was informed the next morning by my taxi driver that the Stardust is going to be torn down soon... I suggest you yelpers all try and take advantage of this \"cheap\" hotel before that happens. Not, of course, that you should expect to get the same service as me, Natashka, but its worth a shot.
