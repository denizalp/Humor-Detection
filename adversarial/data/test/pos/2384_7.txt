Monta Ramen, a top ramen restaurant in Vegas, provides good food, but it is not worth the long wait. Although the nitamago (soft boiled egg) had a great texture, it was bland and lacked the distant soy sauce flavor. My friend's spicy tonkotsu ramen had pork with great proportion of fat and meat; yet, the soup was not spicy by all means. I recommend going to Monta Ramen at 11:30 a.m., its opening time, in order to avoid the wait.
