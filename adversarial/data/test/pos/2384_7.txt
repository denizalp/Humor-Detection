I love tea. When I heard there was a tea bar similar to a coffee bar I knew I had to check this shop out when we were shopping in the area. The parking lot is tiny and the signage is near non-existent at this shop which seems to be a converted house. \n\nYou step inside to be transported into an Instagram friendly wonderland. The interior has that Stark white appearance (More Sansa than Tony) with an open airy feel. I liked the unique tea drinks available and how they were available in either hot or iced versions. It was so overwhelmingly hot today, so I decided on an iced drink and went with the London Fog. The taste was refreshing, slightly sweet, and I could taste the notes of Earl Grey tea in it mixed with creamy milk, hints of vanilla, lavender and sweetener. I tried a sip of the Black Rose too which was also enjoyable but I preferred the London Fog more. I also appreciated the more eco friendly paper straws used here. \n\nUnfortunately, we had come here right before happy hour and didn't even realize had we waited a few more minutes we could have had our drinks at $3 instead of $5.50! We only discovered the happy hour sign (M-F 2-6) as we were driving out of the lot and noticed the ad close on the corner showing their happy hour deals.
