This radio station features dance\/electronica music.  I enjoy listening to it, however they play the same tracks over and over.....it gets old real fast.  I pop in from time to time to break the monotony.\n\nAnother thing I like about this radio station is that there are very few commercial breaks.\n\nWill I continue to listen?  Sure, but need a break now and then.
