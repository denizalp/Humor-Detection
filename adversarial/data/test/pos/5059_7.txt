Who doesn't want to pick up a stick and beat the crap out of something and then have candy come out of it???? \n\nSo if you need a pinata for any function or Hell- just to relieve stress this is the place to go....\n\nLARGE HELLO KITTY PINATA NEEDED.......\nLARGE HELLO KITTY PINATA FOUND!!!!!!!!\n\nThey have all kinds of pinatas for good prices.\nI paid $20.00 for a large hello kitty pinata- for a pinata at a regular store (Party City, Walmart ect...) all they do is put a flattend mylar balloon of the character on a small\/medium ball type of pinata and then charge you $14.99 and higher. Sucky deal if you ask me..... JUST SAYIN!!!!\nBut here you get a pinata that actually is designed to look like your character. If they don't have a certain character on the floor that your lookin for just order in advance and they'll make whatever you want and I think that's $5.00 more. \nThey even have wooden pinata sticks wrapped in different colored cellophane paper for only $1.99 each.\n\nThe store is a little dim and there are party supply stuff for sale however those seem to be priced higher than at Walmart or Target. \nSo I suggest that you buy your pinata here and the other stuff elsewhere.
