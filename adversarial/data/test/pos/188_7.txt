Oysters. Okay. I get scared in ordering oysters or seafood in the Midwest. The oysters from boston with the minette was off the hook.   The food was really good.\n\nService... eh.  I sat at the bar, and was ignored for most of it.   Next time I'll probably ask a pretty woman to accompany me, maybe I'll get more attention.
