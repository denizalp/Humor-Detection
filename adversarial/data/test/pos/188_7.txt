Soooo goooooooood. My cousin recommended this place to me and my girlfriend and let me telllllll yooooou. We loved it. We're from out of town and rely on yelp to help us out with all our vegan restaurant needs. My cousin told me about this place and it also popped up on yelp when we searched for vegan restaurants near us. It had good ratings and pictures so we decided to check it out. Duuuude their freakin philly cheese steak was sooo good. Ahh. Just thinkin bout it now is makin my mouth water.  and let me tel you about their ketchup. It was the freshest tasting ketchup that we've ever had. Mmm. Wish we had a good vegan restaurant like that near where we live in the bay cuz I would be there every day!! I totally recommend this place. Hella chill vibe n cool ass paintings to look at while you're grubbin on your meal. You won't be disappointed. 5 points for Gryffindor!!!
