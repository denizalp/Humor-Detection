Oh mang. I hold Bar + solely responsible for one amazing, amazingly sloppy night on Family Day Eve. \n\nGot a coupon for this place because my friends were always talking about doing karaoke. The private room set-up is awesome. Allows for uninhibited belting of horrible ballads. The prices are decent. We had some pre-Karaoke drinks and then got a bottle ($100) and some beers, and for about eight people, that was more than enough to give us the liquid courage to sing some real doozies such as, \"Black Dog\", \"Love Hurts\", \"Bad Medicine\", \"Final Countdown\", \"If You're Lookin' at Me, You're Lookin' at Country\", and a group rendition of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (a karaoke must) that would have brought a tear to my eye if I was sober enough to know what was happening. \n\nIn total, with our $50 off coupon, our tab for 2 hours of karaoke was around $30 (not including the bottle service, which was paid separately). Really not bad at all split amongst so many, and wouldn't be bad even at full price ($40\/hr for our medium sized room).\n\nThe room was well appointed with three large black leather couches, a huge coffee table and flat-screen TV\/Karaoke machine. The staff checked in on us regularly (but not TOO often), but we did get booted after a couple hours (they'll ask you how long you plan to stay when you reserve. If you've never been, add an extra half hour at least because you will unexpectedly have a blast, unless you are the biggest stick in the mud ever).\n\nComplaints? The sound on the mic is loud but the backing music could be pretty low at times, which meant the voices were the focus. Maybe good if you're Adele. Not so much if you're me. A few songs didn't work, and not ALL had the cheesy Korean vids accompanying them, but I guess I can forgive that. \n\nExtremely fun, extremely memorable night for all in attendance. Unfortunately for the staff and other patrons, we'll for sure be back.
