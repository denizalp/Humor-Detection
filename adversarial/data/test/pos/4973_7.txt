I got there at 6:58pm in hopes of quickly getting a cupcake to surprise my wife on my way home. Rather than welcoming me, two ladies inside saw me coming and quickly locked the door while looking at me through the glass window! Wow that's poor customer service and just rude. I know you close at 7 but I only need one minute to buy a cupcake and leave.
