Once again we are faced with a challenge of reviewing something on Yelp that's other than a service establishment. Once again I will attempt to write a valuable review for you, the random reader, who for some reason is interested in reading other yelpers' thoughts on a park. Let me attempt this from a user's functional perspective.\n\nFor runners, joggers and lazy runners, ahem, 'power walkers', the High Park has a network of several off-road  trails that crisscross through the woods and connect to various asphalted roads in the park. I really like running in this park - there's a lake, sufficient number of hills, patches of thick forest and urban trails - in short the kind of entertainment and variety that long distance runners are constantly looking for.\n\nFor cyclists, again, the park has a number of options from paved roads to mountain biking hills. For families, picnickers, pet owners, the amount of open space is plenty although it can get quite busy on a sunny summer holiday. Truly, yours to discover.\n\nThe park comes with its share of urban ugliness - large parking lots, unnecessarily wide paved streets, junk food restaurant, etc. There's an amphitheatre that runs 'Shakespeare in the Park' during summer months and performances are packed.\n\nIn summary, although nowhere as great or varied as NYC's Central Park, our little High Park has tons to offer for entertainment, relaxation and a break from the usual urban chaos. Enjoy your visit!
