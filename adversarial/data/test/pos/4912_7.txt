I've been to this location several times.   Once for a tuxedo fitting for an out of state wedding, which they did for free, and also to buy clothing.\n\nI've had nothing but positive experiences.  I've dealt with Nathan and Bruce, who are both professionals at what they do, and were extremely helpful in helping me find, and get fitted for clothing.\n\nThe selection is fantastic, and quality of the clothing top rate.  If you need well priced, quality clothing, and want excellent customer service, I'd recommend this location.
