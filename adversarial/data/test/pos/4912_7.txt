Let me just start by saying that there are 3 experiences you can have at The Griffin. \nI came here with an old friend last Sunday, and we had a great time catching up in this comfortable and intimate old pub style bar. It is one of the lat few bastions to get a cheap beer without staring at a video poker machine.\n\nThe 5 star experience is 10pm-2am Sunday-Thursday. During the late night happy hour, you can get in easily without waiting in line, you can almost always find a spot to lounge around with friends next to or near one of the 2 over-sized fireplaces in the center of the main room, and the bartenders are generally happy to have the business. $3 drafts is not uncommon, but $3 dogfish head drafts is. Well drinks are part of the happy hour as well, but I forgot and ordered a Blanton's Bourbon neat, which was $12. The patrons run the gamut from the resident hipsters and scenesters, to the Ed Hardy and Affliction clad middle age travelers trying to look and feel young by finding the \"Local hangouts.\" During these times I would have no problem coming up here and finding someone at the bar to chat with. The juke box is great as so many people have mentioned...however, I'm not going to call it the best in town simply because the rotation is pretty small, only having maybe 30 albums.\n\nThe 4 star experience is Friday & Saturday. It's much busier, and louder with more bartenders, which should mean faster drink service (but it doesn't) yet it is still better than most, and the GREAT selection of beers on tap and an amazing selection of bourbons, for me makes it worth the wait. The crowd is less diverse, and typically a little more standoffish and cliquey. There is usually a DJ in the back room. There is still typically not a wait to get in, but occasionally  you might have to stand a couple minutes out front, but inevitably there is a slow trickle over to Beauty Bar for those that want to dance.\n\nThe 3 star experience is Post First Friday. The block between Downtown Cocktail and Beauty bar turns into the Emo version of the line outside Vanity or Pure. Expect a 15-30 minute wait to get in. Once you get in, those fireplaces that were once so cozy and inviting, are now being cursed because they are taking up valuable standing room. The bartenders are rarely happy to see you, and I was seriously told by one of the male bartenders once, \"if you want drinks faster get a girl to order them.\" All of this being said, if you manage a seat or a great spot to post up, it is a great spot for crowd watching. \nIf you are a guy with a subscription to Suicide Girls....This is the spot for you.\nIf you are a girl into guys with ear gauges, tattoos, and beanies...This is the spot for you.\n\nI am none of these things, but I never have a bad time when i'm here.
