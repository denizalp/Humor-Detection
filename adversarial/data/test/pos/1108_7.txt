Terrible experience, didn't even get to sit down.\n\nWalked in and the hostess wanted to seat us at a table in the middle of the busy dining room. I asked to be seated one table over which was more out of the way. I was quickly told that table was not available because the waitress was on break. \n\nWhen we questioned her, she replied, \"Oh, I'm not kidding! See all those other tables, those are hers, too. I can't seat you there either. See? She's on break right over there.\"\n\nWe were incredulous. We turned around and walked out.\n\nI'd heard great things about the food here and wanted to try it. But not so badly that I will allow a waitress to dictate at what table I sit. The lunatics do not run the asylum.\n\nNow since I've had such a bad experience without even siting down, I certainly won't be back and I'm angry enough to write a and review. \n\nThe hostess should have thought things through a bit better.
