I admit it... \nIt was me who convinced Sarah P and Jared M to accompany me to Mojo last night after the OYE at La Bocca.  I used the excuse that Sarah really needed to try it, but honestly, I selfishly just wanted it - I didn't care too much about Sarah trying it or Jared getting it either.  We walked the 4 blocks to get our fro-yo from Mojo (me in heels no less), and it was totally worth it.\n\nI mixed up a big cup of original tart, pomegranate tart, and passion fruit flavors with melon mochi and yogurt chips.  The only negative is that the melon mochi is not as delightful as the original (plain) flavored mochi.  Other than that, I was happy as a clam.  Friendly service, clean topping bar, and the total for all four cups (we brought a cup back for Julian) was $16.  (Yes, it was on the pricier side, but it was worth it).\n\nNow I'm off to make time in my day to get to the gym to burn off the wine, pizza, and fro-yo that was consumed last night, and I'll soon start that damn wedding diet (again)!
