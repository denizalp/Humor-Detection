I could not locate their ice cream menu and thought they only sold vanilla ice cream (which was advertised with the gold leaves). So I got the vanilla ice cream cone for ~$7. The ice cream itself was creamy and your standard ice cream! Stars off because my cone (without a napkin) was passed on from the cashier to two different people before it was filled. They could do more to improve sanitary conditions.
