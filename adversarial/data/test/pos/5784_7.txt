I honestly don't understand the 4.5 star rating for this place.  At all!  I chose this place based on the star rating, wrong choice this time. Let me walk you through my first and last visit.  My boyfriend and I decided to spend our date night with reflexology and a nice dinner. We stopped by Head 2 Foot Spa to start our evening.  When we walked in the manager or owner, smiled and spoke and told us the prices for services.  The price sheet said Reflexology (60 mins) $30. Under that was the option to get the combo which was reflexology + a 40 minute massage (neck, shoulder and head).  I told him we only wanted two 1 hour foot reflexology sessions.  He said, this and this is the same, this is longer.  (Translation: the foot reflexology also has a massage included but with the combo, the massage time is longer).  I said, very clearly, No thank you.  We're only interested in foot reflexology sessions.  Again he said yes, I see but it's the same.  While pointing to the price sheet, I said how it is the same when the price sheet says Reflexology, $30 for 60 mins. It doesn't say it includes a massage. The combo does but the reflexology column doesn't. I said clearly, again, we only want reflexology.  Finally he said ok ... follow me. \n\nWe followed him to the back.  We were told to wait here and enjoy.  No other instructions were given.  Two masseuse (women) came out with 2 buckets of hot water and told us to put our feet in the buckets.  We did.  Please note: if you are a size 9 and up, your feet will not sit comfortably in the bucket.  It's not big enough so you'll need to place your foot one on top of the other - Bummer!\n\nThey told us to lie back.  We did.  They begin to place warm towels around our necks and started rubbing our shoulder.  I immediately told her less pressure.  It was rough as hell! I had on earrings, a necklace, freshly pressed curls in my hair and a face full of makeup because again ... it was date night and we thought we were only getting a foot reflexology session.  She began to massage my shoulders and hair, and started massaging my face with lotion.  So long Cover girl foundation and concealer.  I assumed this was the most I would get as far as the massaging part went because again, we asked for foot reflexology only. She continued to massage my shoulders, neck, face and arms. Once the pressure lightened up a bit I drifted off.  She moved to my feet and started massaging, applying absolutely no pressure points like you normally find with reflexology sessions.  It was literally someone just massaging my feet. \n\nAfterwards she said turn over.  I did.  She continues to massage my back, shoulders and neck.  We was so rough that I was jumping from the piercing pain.  Again I said lighter please.  She obliged but then took her fist and started pounding all over my back and neck. Talking about uncomfortable! When she finished, she simply said \"Done\", picked up the too small bucket and left.  My boyfriend and I sat up, looked at each other and laughed a bit saying to ourselves... what the hell just happened. \n\nWhen we walked to the front to pay, the manager or owner asked how was it?  I quickly told him he misunderstood me.  I asked for two 60 mins foot reflexology sessions.  We did not ask for massages.  He said No it's all the same. WTH?!  Me: Geesh, again with this?! Why?  He said you should have told me feet only.  I said sir, that's EXACTLY what I said when you kept trying to get me to get the combo.  He said well you should have told me and told them to stop.  I'm sorry, next time!  Really?!  Yeah, I'll pass on that.  I don't know how else I would have explained FOOT RELEXLOGY SESSION ONLY except for saying it which is what I did. \n\nLastly, the worse part of this whole experience is the overall visit cost me more than it was worth.  Aside from forcing me into a fully dressed massage (who does that?!), I was soooooo sore the next day that I had to soak in Epsom Salt and hot water.  I could barely stand up straight the next day, my lower back was hurting that bad!  The foot massage (not reflexology) and fully dressed massages, messed up curls and messed up make up just wasn't worth the $60 price tag plus the tip - because you gotta tip anyway
