This is a joke right? I've never in my life been to a used book store that's so expensive. I bought a book on Amazin for 1 cent with 2.99 shipping for a total of 3.00 and they were selling it here for $16.  So I continued to look through the store and check amazon this place is a ripoff. This is Vegas, people struggle, there aren't very many jobs,  I've been to book stores in the nicest neighborhoods in California and they were 80% cheaper than here. The library has books for 25 cents in Vegas. Don't waste your money here. I have a good job and still wouldn't buy anything here,\nNot because I can't afford it but because I would feel like an idiot. I walked out if here after 10 minutes.
