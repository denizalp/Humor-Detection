Great location- in the heart of the downtown. I would rate this place for 3.5. I was lucky to purchase for 100$ two procedure- facial and body scrub, during the spa week. \nI arrived on time, and the aesthetician brought me to spacious locker room. There was not much privacy bc I shared space with others- what was fine with me.\nThe room where the procedures were held was tastefully decorated and looked clean and neat. \nI knew that for 100$ I would not get the same quality as I would pay full price, and I was right. The body scrub was nice and gentle, but I prefer a stronger scrubbing. The facial...hmm it was difficult to say bc I fell asleep lol. Probably I slept good 30 min bc when I awoke, the esthetician was finishing her work. I liked the facial, I actually added acid to it. However, either acid was not strong enough or the esthetician had not done a full procedure bc I wasn't peeling or I didn't feel any tingling during acid ( I was awake that time). \nThe place is new, at least for me, and here couple hints where they could improve or hints that I didn't like\/ miss:\n1. Please always warm up the room before bringing the client. Especially in Cleveland and when the temperature drops to 35 degree. It was cold in the beginning- no pleasure of having the procedures in the cold.\n2. The esthetician could mention all products what she put on the face. Either during the procedure or after it. Yes I got to see the products at the cashier but I would love the esthetician tells me exactly what she used and why.\n3. Omg, buy some snacks in lounge area lol they had just water and tea\/ coffee \n4. Don't say loud my code for my locker when the people are around\nThings that I liked:\n1. Beautiful interior and lounge\n2. Nice and organic products used for facial-naturopathica \n3. Great deal and opportunity to try a new place\n4. Friendly esthetician- she brought me SPF cream when I asked.\nI will probably comeback and try some luxury facials :) check it out!
