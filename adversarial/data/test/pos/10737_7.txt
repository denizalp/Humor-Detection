REVIEW OF NORTHSHORE SUMMIT TRAIL \n\n    Why should you read my reviews? One reason is that some of the beautiful hiking spots that I create as a business listing only appears on my profile page, or the correct name is replaced with the name of the National Park. The Northshore Summit Trail is an example of both  :'(  . This is an exclusive review brought to you directly by Daniel. S. \n\n    The Northshore Summit Trail is only 30 miles from my home in Green Valley but in reality 2,000 light years from home. The trailhead is off the beautiful Northshore Drive in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area where Redstone bluffs and Muddy Mountains parallel the rolling Bitter Spring Valley at mile marker 20. \n\n    The trail is a half mile adventure with use trails extending it significantly. The goal of the hike is to reach the top of a bluff with grand views of the Muddy Mountains Wilderness Area region of the National Park. The views include the Northshore Peak, the open desert reaching out to the Muddy Mountains Wilderness Area, an overlook of the Bowl of Fire, redstone bluffs, and distant vistas of Lake Mead. \n\n   This is a moderate hike. From the parking lot the uphill climb is gradual. After a fork in the trail, as the trail continues, it becomes steep. This is a trail where you need to be sure footed. The drop down is steep. But, there is a better way to reach the summit. The fork to the right leads to a less steep trail that reaches the summit creating a circle. After reaching the top of the hill, you will see cougar rock. I named it cougar rock because it looks exactly like a cougar. The cougar watches another hiking junction. You want to turn left to climb up volcanic rocks to reach the top of the summit. Even better, if you want to extend your time in the open spaces of where Lake Mead National Recreation Area merges with the Muddy Mountains Wilderness Area, the trail leads over a few peaks eventually ending at a bluff. \n\n    The Northshore Summit Trail with the use trail over the peaks is around an hour adventure. I recommend combining it with Roger's Spring.  If you have had a rough week and want a short hike in the great outdoors I recommend the hike by itself with the scenic Northshore Drive.
