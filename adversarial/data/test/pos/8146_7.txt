Three of us ate there on Sunday 9\/6\/15. Two of us ordered the seafood platter. The other ordered cooked shrimp. The platters were just ok. The scallops tasted gritty which means they were not rinsed well enough. The entire platter was seasoned with a mixture of spices, which was, at times, overwhelming. The small popcorn shrimp was good but the large shrimp was cooked too long as they were tough. The stuffed crab was very good, while the flounder & oysters were terrible. The hush puppies were the highlight of the meal. The salad was very good & the sweet potato was good except there was an upcharge for selecting it. It was served with cinnamon & honey butter. The French fries were selected on the other two meals & they were just ok. Two of us had tea, which was very good, and the other had coke. \nService was ok but it could have been better. The girl brought our check & just plopped it on the table never asking if we needed anything else & she left. We had to flag her down to ask for a box. The noise level was horrible especially the table of 6 near us. They were so loud you could not talk over them. When they left we finally were able to talk but the level of noise was still loud. \nOverall, I would not return to this restaurant again. Too much was wrong with the food & service to spend $56.00 again.
