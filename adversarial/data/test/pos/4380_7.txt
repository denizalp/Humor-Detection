The lover took me here for Valentine's day dinner. I've really been wanting to try this place. \n\nI really loved the decor and the feel of the restaurant when you first walk in. For drinks, I ordered the white chocolate martini. OH MY GOSH! this was amazing! I ordered two and couldn't finish the second one but you definitely get your money's worth. It was so delicious. As for my entree, I ordered the bacon mushroom bistro steak. I wish there was more of the creamy mushroom sauce. And I ordered my steak medium, however I think it came out too rare. and it comes with A LOT of potatoes. lol. \n\nI wasn't too fond of my entree, however I really liked my drink so I'd probably come back to try some more drinks. And the customer service was really good.
