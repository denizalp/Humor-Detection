is it because I have been to Venice, that I had to rate this place a 3?  Since I have particularly good taste, and know how to cook, I tend to be very critical of meals that I can reproduce myself, thusly leading to a more acute assessment of taste and experience. With all that being said (pats self on back) I just can't recommend Veneto Trattoria for those with discerning taste. Food aside, the decor, atmosphere, and location are nothing special. The service however is excellent, as our waiter scored 2 points for the wine and dessert recommendation, besides he had an Italian accent, and and old world charm that I couldn't help but like.  Ok, so back to the food. The dish I had, a homemade egg noodle pasta dish, with a variety of fish and shellfish, in white wine scampi sauce, was good. Not, great, but good. I have made a better seafood pasta, and the portion was pretty small, so I had to resort to dipping fresh bread in the sauce. (which really isn't so bad) I even finished my dates lasagna, which tasted exactly like Chef Boyardee. I thought to myself out loud \"either Chef Boyardee is a genius and has captured the taste of traditional Italian lasagna, or this lasagna just isn't very good. Either way the wine and dessert were superb. So would I recommend this place to someone? Perhaps for dessert and wine, but I am sure you can get a similar experience elsewhere that serves better entrees. I most likely won't go back, but had a great time anyway, with my date. \n\nClassic moment: after hearing a cough repeatedly coming from outside the restaurant, I couldn't help but look. The cough was deep, penetrating, and harsh like the sound a ship's hull makes as it crashes into large waves. It was brooding.  As I turned around to look at this poor old man, dying of cancer, coughing while waiting for Death himself to come, I was shocked to see this 12 year old sitting at a table in front of Starbucks, hacking away!  Wow, that kid can cough, can someone get him a cough drop. \"RICOOOOOLLLLLLAAAA\" I wondered if he had the lasagna.
