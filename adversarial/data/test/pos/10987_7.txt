If I lived near this place, I'd be a diabetic. I'd probably eat dessert and maybe I'd have room for a healthy meal I'd be a happy, smiling,yelping  and sweet toothed dude!  But my doc, the everlasting kill joy, told me \"Everything in moderation.\"  Exept here the stuff is so good, I'd eat this stuff in moderation times 2..\n\nEverytime I visit relatives in Vegas, this is a must stop. This is the first time I've been here since they moved to this new building right across from the Cannery Casino right off the 1-15 on Craig Road.  The old location, while convenient for North Vegas customers near the Aliante Casino, supposedly had an unpredicable oven.  And that is as bad as a barbecue without fire or canoeing in shallow water.  So these new digs have reliable electricity for their ovens.  It's also bigger in the front area, so  they can offer a few places to sit down and eat a delicious lunch, such as their pizza, soda, and sandwhich combo for $6.00.  I love their Cuban Foccacio Pork Sandwhich. With a slice of ham and baked pork, some pickle and Swiss Cheese, it is grilled with butter so there is some sweet and sour, crunchy and soft, meaty, and nicely aromatic.  \n\nBut I came here for dessert.  As usual,a I had the bright green lime cream tart, slice of flan, a very fresh fruit tart, and vanilla cake with frosting.  Yet, even better than the dessert might be the Cuban bread.  People drive from miles around to have this lightly sweet, soft dough and crisp french bread.  If you heat the loaf before slicing it, the subtle flavors come through and the crust gets crisper. The loaves are big, and only  two bucks plus change for a loaf.\n\nThe staff is friendly, and service is good.  You might have to wait for a sandwhich, so be patient. They supposedly make awesome cakes, too.
