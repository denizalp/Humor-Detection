I've been here 3 times on different seasons when visiting Vegas and each time it's mostly the same things. For those of you from CA, this is pretty much like Aquarium of the Pacific.\n\nYou walk around to certain stations and listen to the pre-recorded tour on the little recorded thing they give you. I think the most memorable parts of the tours were the stingray pond where you get to touch the stingrays (they're so soft and smooth!!). The other cool section is the part where you walk into the shark exhibit and you're standing on this clear glass so you can see underneath you as they swim around. The moon jellies were pretty too\n\nNot bad if you have nothing else to do in Vegas
