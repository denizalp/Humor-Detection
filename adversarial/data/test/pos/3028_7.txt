I was pretty excited about the beer selection here. They have everything from domestic, well, I guess they are imports to Canadian craft. Normally, all you can get at ballparks is Budweiser and such. I was happy that I could drink like a local. I really liked the area right outside of the ballpark, where there's a legit water feature that you can hang around (and in).\n\nWe didn't get great seats because we were visiting and just wanted to check out the stadium. I understand how jazzed people are to have the dome open to get the sunlight, but it was hot that day and I really would have appreciated it being half open or something. I feel like that would have been a solid compromise. On the other hand, it was cool being able to watch the game with an incredible backdrop of the CN Tower. So, I guess that was the silver lining in all this.\n\nThe seats seemed smaller and pretty close together. Also, there were no cup holders. So I have to put my drink on the ground like a savage? But, I can't keep my water bottle closed because they have to keep the bottle cap? Yea, that works. It also would be cool if they have monitors all around so you're not missing the game if you're waiting in the bathroom or concessions lines. Oh, and the concessions were ok. I just got chicken fingers and fries and it was decent.\n\nCan anyone tell me why they have to take off the bottle cap on bottled water and keep it?
