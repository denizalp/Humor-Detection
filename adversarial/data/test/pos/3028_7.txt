Do not mail your mortgage payment from this post office.  If you do you better learn to spell  F-O-R-E-C-L-O-S-U-R-E.\n\nIt seems whenever I would mail bill payments form my home or office from this branch they would be late.\n\nI agree with the rest of the reviews, the staff seems to have molasses in their arteries.\n\nIf you need your mail to get there on time, go next door to the urgent care center, you can hop on the medical helicopter that flies in most days. Maybe they can do a little air mail gig for you.
