Went there to try on HJT CL-MAX helmet that i researched to purchase to protect my precious noggin in case of its contact with significantly harder road pavement. \nAnyhow, its your typical \"Mom-n-Pop\" store - Small, friendly, helpful. I was greeted by owner and he helped me around. Since i knew exactly what i wanted it was not much browsing for me, but he did answered all my questions and shown me other products in the store. He was very patient and explained some finer less obvious details for me. \n\nBleah, bleah, bleah - How is the price? BEST price i found for this very helmet online would be 'bout $170 and they had it for $184 in the store, tax and all. Yeah, a few bucks more, but i got to try it on before buying it, service was good, i can bring it bakc if something is wrong, etc and MOST importantly - If no one buys from local places, there will be no local places to go and see, touch, try, etc stuff. And that would sux. So, i pay a few bux more to support rocking local business. Thanks Todd!!!
