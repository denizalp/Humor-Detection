Not impressed...not even happy. \n\nMy gal pal and I did a day of beauty, got our hair colored and decided to doll up and do our nails as well. \n\nThis nail salon is by her house so we thought would give it a shot. \n\nI got basic acrylic nails done, was feeling Vampy so went with long and cherry red. The Co-owner (husband) worked on my nails. \n\nThis could very well be the worst nail job I have ever had in my years of Vamping beauty. He did a sloppy job attaching the nails, super glue all over my hands...bad. The polish job was sad, after he sloppily polished my nails he then spent 10 minutes cleaning off the polish residue from the sides of my fingers with a brush and nail polish remover. I could have done a better job using my left hand! \n\nHe has no business doing nails. This to me is just cheap, for the sake of not having to pay an additional employee. This will cost him business which will be a lot more than what he would pay a skilled nail technician.\n\nSure you may have customer's come in for the first time, but what if they don't return? Then what? There is a nail shop on every corner, why would I return to a place that does a crappy job? I won't!\n\nHe bragged of being a proud family business, that means nothing if you have unskilled family members working. He even had his 14 year old daughter working doing pedicures. That is just not professional to me. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.\n\nMy friend had her nails done by his Wife, I have to say she did a kick ass job on her nails! My friend got the pink and white solar nails. Awesome! They look stunning! \n\nA turn off is that I did notice the lady doing pedicures used the same foot scrubber on two different customers. Not once did I see any cleaning or sterilization being done between customer's! NOOOOOOOOOOO! Bad Bad Bad. \n\nThe place could have been a lot cleaner, luckily for them the health department did not swing by and do an inspection as it would not have been good! \n\nIf you go here...AVOID pedicures and ONLY have the Co-owner (Wife) work on your nails. The Husband is not skilled in acrylics! \n\nYou have been warned.
