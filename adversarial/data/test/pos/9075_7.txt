Hiking Thunderbird Park for the second time in two days my friend looked at me and said \"if you lived here I bet you'd hike every single mountain...\".  I agreed but saw the futility of it:  perhaps I'm oversimplifying, but my impression is that here in Arizona every hiking trail looks much the same:  Rocks, cactus, heat, repeat and not a shade tree in sight.\n\nSo I didn't mind returning to Thunderbird, especially knowing that I'd be hiking a different trail than I'd done the previous day. \n\nDay one took me on the Coach Whip Trail, a 5-mile long, mostly flat, rocky path that's good for anyone who doesn't want to climb.  The web site bills this as a \"moderate\" hike which I imagine it would've been had we done it in it's entirety and then retraced our steps back to the beginning (Coach Whip is not a loop-trail).  I found it easy and rocky.  \n\nDay two I returned for a shorter hike with more elevation.  A loop trail took me up to the highest peak (not very high nor difficult but there's a nice view from up top), the one marked with an American flag.  Taking my time, this hike was over and done in about 1 hour and I noticed a couple of people going twice around for an extra work-out.  The hikes here seem perfectly designed for exercise, not exploration.    \n\nEven though there's 15 miles of trails at Thunderbird, I easily climbed to what appeared to be the highest peak so I have a hunch that the rest of the trails are equally user-friendly with one exception:  there were no restrooms to be found on any part I hiked which can be a problem as there's really no privacy to be found in a cactus-laced landscape.  \n\nTrails here are well-marked and well-defined, your leashed dog is welcome, and your chances of getting lost appear to be impossible.  The park itself is 1,185 acres and its existence is a good reason to get you and your dog off the couch.  \n\nA map of TP's trail network can be found here:  https:\/\/www.glendaleaz.com\/parksandrecreation\/thunderbirdpark.cfm
