A tiny (seriously TINY) hidden gem in Heritage Square.  I loved the interior and the staff was super friendly.  Instead of trying out their coffee, I actually ordered one of their pre-packaged drinks.  If you ever stop by this place, they carry this AMAZING kombucha.  It's called WIld Tonic Rosemary Lemon Jun-Kombucha.\n\nI'm a huge fan of kombucha, but never heard of or tried jun-kombucha.  After my first sip, I fell in love. It's got a much lighter taste than regular kombucha -- almost tastes like a light tea.  Definitely recommend giving it a shot if you're ever in the area, or if you see it at a store!  Yum!
