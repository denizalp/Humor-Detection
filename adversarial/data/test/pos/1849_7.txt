Sanko Trading looks so out of place in this part of Queen Street West! I was so surprise to see a store that devoted to all Japanese culture and items in this area of town!\n\nThe high standard and quality of Japanese goods and kitchenwares does reflect in the pricing at Sanko. I kind of used to the idea of Made in Japan VS Made in China, Expensive VS Cheap, Imported VS local... \n\nI would never have guess the cute little teacups I have at Sushi Tei (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/jWrnT-VNIsTKjHCTyj2hdw?select=e3lP3Js2gX8k9WOF9ieslg) cost $16 each!! But they sure are cute and good quality!\n\nLove the noodle selections here!! Some of them I cannot get in the usual Chinese grocery stores I been too...\n\nMaybe one day I have to try cooking some real Japanese food with the help of some of the premade ingredients in Sanko Trading!
