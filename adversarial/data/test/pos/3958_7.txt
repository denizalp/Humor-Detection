You had me a crepe.\nBut I'll keep coming back because they are actually good!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Chococrepe... 5 star surprised!\nThere were so many crepes to choose from!\n...And I didn't order Nutella, but I sure was tempted.\n\nI opted for the Dulce De Leche Pear crepe.\nThe crepe was super thin and piping hot.\nThe caramel sauce and pear combo is one of my favourites.\nI should have got ice cream too!\n\nThe hot chocolate sounded delicious, but I'm waiting for a nice chilly evening before I order a cup.\n\nAwesome spot!  I can't wait to come back for some sweet, sweet chocolate and\/or crepe goodness! =D
