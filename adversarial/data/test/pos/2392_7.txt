My first experience was at TdB in Miami in 2009.  I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL FAN SINCE. Every time I go to Miami, I must go to TdB.  \n\nWhen they opened up in Las Vegas, I was so excited, I almost wet myself (just like I do when the men walk around with their meat sticks).  \n\nOkay all jokes aside, my BF and I made a point we'd try TdB LV.  The morning before dinner I go to the Aria pool and get sloshed (hey, it's Vegas).  I was drunk out of my mind and managed to knock the f out and took a quick nap.  My alarm goes off and so I awake in a druken stupor.  I don't know how but I managed to pump myself up and I had to slap myself around (literally) to MAKE SURE I WASN'T GOING TO MISS TdB LV.  Drunk as I was, I managed to pull myself together to 1) wash my face 2) curl my long ass hair *tricky and dangerous while intoxicated and 3) shade in my eyebrows *extremely difficult to do while drunk and the outcome can be pretty darn scary.  With a one track mind, I softly slur to myself, \"Nancy, you can do this! TdB!, TdB!, TdB!\"\n\nResult:  reeking like alcohol, I depart from Aria Resort and arrive in a cab to TdB with stank breath, half curled hair, small burn mark on my ear and neck, crooked eyebrows and two shades of red lipstick...i wasn't too far from a clown.  HOT MESS... ALL FOR TEXAS de BRAZIL (That's how good it really is!)\n\nThe food is delicious although sometimes, the meat is salty, salty and saltier.  My fav is the filet mignon.  I stay away from the parmesan chicken, I actually end up despising the guy who carries the parmesan chicken for the night, despite how cute he may be.  The smell is offensive and I can't and won't get past the stank.\n\nThe salad bar is an understatement  because it's waaaaaaaaaay more than just salad ie. sushi, variety of cold cuts, 100's of cheeses the list goes on.  I love the variation and endless choices.\n\nBEST SANGRIA I'VE HAD AT A RESTAURANT...HANDS DOWN! \n\n\nPS.  the lobster brisque is bomb diggity
