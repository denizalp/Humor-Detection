Service was slow and the burger came out on a soggy bun.  Asked for a fresh bun but took forever so ended up just eating the meat.  Also, the place was super hot.  Everyone at our table was sweating.  Maybe they were just having a bad night but I wouldn't go back to this place after this experience.
