A ten!!!!!!!! That is all that needs to be said. Or in Yelp world, a solid five. The family ordered the gladiator and avocado pies and both were awesome. The buttery sourdough (I am guessing) crust was amazing. We loved every bite and will go back again and again. Wish it was close to my house but worth the drive. The price for the pies was well within reason. A perfect meal.
