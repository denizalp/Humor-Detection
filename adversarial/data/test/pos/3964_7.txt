Three separate visits to this restaurant have left me really impressed each time. The ajja merguez was bursting with bold flavors and the big flatbread that accompanied the dish was perfect for wiping every bit of the tasty sauce off the dish. Similarly, the kebab was scrumptious and though I was not very hungry when I met my UYE group for the evening that I ordered this (and I was hoping I would have leftovers to take home), I ended up finishing it - and the salad of eggplant, capers, and olives that came with it. The lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender and nicely seasoned; I ordered it with rice, which I prefer over couscous. The hostesses are very friendly -- don't hesitate to ask them for suggestions. If you love Mediterranean-type cuisine and want to try a restaurant that sets the bar high for flavor and service, come here!
