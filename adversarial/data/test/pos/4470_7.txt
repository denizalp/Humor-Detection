I tried to take the family here for dinner 3 times.  Each time, we were told the wait was 30+ minutes.  Since I hate waiting and they don't take reservations, we passed and went somewhere else.  On the 4th attempt, The Better Half went ahead of time to put our name on the list so that I could join them later when we got seated....it worked perfectly.  I was in a business meeting and she timed it perfectly so that I was able to make it right after my meeting.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nAppetizers\nSpinach Artichoke Dip\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=kmUXZrIRtqqJbOxfJeksrw\nSweet Potato Fries\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=0FNCsaKdjoPOayWsFC8x5w\n\nPizzas\n10\" Thin Crust - Onions, Green Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=dD0jzKpj2Oh-eaE7sVvLZw\n8\" Thick Crust - Pepperoni, Sausage\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=VxSsA7mn7xU0QCmvjHrfUg\n10\" Thick Crust - Anchovies, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese, Onions\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=HOLWbqCsw7-cPBoyFTY19Q\n\nYeah....we were hungry!  We ordered too much food and had to take a lot of it home.\n\nThe Pizzas were cooked well done, per our request.  We enjoy well done Pizza.  Because the ingredients are fresh, it took 45 minutes for the Pizzas to come out.  I had the Thin Crust.  After such a long wait, I had high expectations....unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was just OK.  The Crust didn't have much flavor and the ingredients, while fresh, didn't hit my taste buds on a positive note.....damn.\n\nThe rest of the family felt the same way about their Pizzas.  Kiddo had the Thick Crust Pepperoni & Sausage....he too is a Pizza lover like me and he said his was just OK.  Mom & The Better Half had the other Pizza and they too were underwhelmed.\n\nThe Appetizers were the highlight of the evening.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was delish & the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.\n\nOverall, it was an average dining experience.  Was it worth the long wait to get in, then the long wait to get your Pizza?  No.\n\nReturn Factor - 10%
