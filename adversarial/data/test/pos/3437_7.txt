I got the 190 octane with an extra shot. It tasted PHENOMENAL, and i could barely taste the liquor. I had already tossed back a couple shots doubting the true strength of this bad boy, thinking you are all pussies, but this put me and my buddies completely on our asses. We were doing backflips off of fire hydrants and having sword fights with our left over yard sticks which were then destroyed.\n\n I went to the MGM one, and holy god, at the price you pay, i would have to agree it is the best bang for your buck in Vegas in terms of liquor. The bartender was super friendly as well. Holy shit, when you \"unplug\" that extra shot, be prepared to go to Shwastyville.\n\nEasily my go-to spot now when I'm in Vegas and wanting to get belligerent.
