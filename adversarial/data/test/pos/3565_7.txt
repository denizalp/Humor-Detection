Brioche eh?\nI visited this location twice on two separate visits to Vegas. \nAfter seeing the Vegas prices I thought that maybe it had the Vegas taste.\nIt seems this is a one man stand and if there is any other customers, you should be prepared to wait.\nI have tasted a latte from here and it seems like from reviews that it just depends on the barista. It seemed mine had burned the milk and it wasn't very pleasant. \nThe chocolate cookie can't be too hard to mess up but it seems here it is a very thick almost cake like cookie that doesn't have much sugar in the recipe. It was not really my style.\nOn our recent visit, my boyfriend picked up three different sweet brioche's; Peanut Butter and Jelly, Nutella, and Cinnamon. It seemed that the Nutella was the winner. The cinnamon was OK but still needed some more sweetness. Maybe it is the american in me? The peanut butter and Jelly had some good flavor but there was only a small amount of jelly on the top for show and none throughout so it definitely needed more.\nThis is a prime location and it is unfortunate that this falls short.
