3 statues performing on a platform right in the waterfall in the Palazzo Shoppes?\n\nHAHA!\n\nSo funny but this was entertaining! Tons of people gathered around the fountain to watch them perform. I didn't stay for the whole thing and just caught glimpses of it as I walked by. I just found it funny that the status shot water out of their hands. Yay for water guns!!\n\nThere were performances on the hour from 12p-6p. I'm not sure if it's daily but I caught the show on Sunday.
