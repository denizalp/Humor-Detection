Drove by this place a few weeks ago and wanted to stop.  Looks like my kinda place.  Imagine Roadhouse without Swayze and his flowing mullet.  Brad Wesley would send his henchmen in here for sure.  Other reviewers said the wings are dope so thats what I had.  Got them breaded joints and they were pretty good.  The hot maple sauce was really good.  Maybe a dusting of cayanne before the sauce dunk would give it better texture and more heat.  C & C Music Factory isn't the only one that make ya wanna sweat.  They had Snowdrift Vanilla Porter for 2.00.  In these neck of the woods dark beer is too much for most.  Keep it light and fizzy.  The beers were still fresh and I drank the hell outa 'em.  Place was packed with locals and the bartenders were nice.  Only thing thats dropping stars for me is the bullshit pop country they played the WHOLE time we were there.  Were not 12 year old girls shopping and tanning at the mall.  The place was full of adults and I wished they would of played better tunes.  God, I cant wait till this country music crap goes away.  Hank, Bill and Johnny would be rolling over in their graves....
