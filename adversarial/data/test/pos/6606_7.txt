So Carrot Top was on vacation (boo, but the man deserves it, his show is that good), and I'm still mourning the loss of my beloved \"Peep Show\" at Planet Hollywood, so my husband and I decided to give Fantasy a try. \n\nAaaand the girls are super purty and I loved the blonde with the short-cropped hair (kind of Helen Slater \"Legend of Billie Jean\"-ish), but real talk, I could only see 10 boobs in and out of different sexy outfits for so long before I started having a different kind of fantasy ... about what I was going to eat afterwards. I actually started to get bored (my husband, of course, did not). \n\nAnd THEN, in came Sean E. Cooper. I nearly peed in my seat, that's how funny this guy was (or, it could just have been me, I did just turn 40). The singer \/ hostess Jaime Lynch was also fantastic and did her best to keep the energy going. Along with the amazing aerialist (who probably got lost on her way to Zumanity and ended up in this show), they kept me from falling asleep. \n\nThree stars for Sean, Jaime and the aerialist (Sonya?), and one more star because I nabbed Sean E. Cooper (as he was literally walking through the crowd) and got all fangirl on him, yet he still talked to me and shook my hand and did NOT call for security.
