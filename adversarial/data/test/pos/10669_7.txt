So I really wanted to like this place, I had read the signs about a Camp fire Ceasar and all.  And I did really like the cheap drink specials 6 bucks for a pbr and a jameson after 10 pm.  But what happened to me and a friend here tonight will serve me to never go to this establishment ever again.  We were talking at the bar about various things and I found out that our conversation about Americans being fat due to a lack of public transportation was completely forbidden.   My friend and I were just sitting at the bar when all of a sudden the bartender tells us that we need to leave, now I have been wasted and told that I would not be served any more, but his was entirely due to our conversation and our something or whatever with positive body image.  Instead of trying to argue with us, our bartender suggests that we drink our drinks fast or get a refund.  WTF?!?  This is the kind of bush league stuff that you only hear about and never experience in real life.  The poutine was great, as were the drink specials but woe be to you if you mention anything to do with fatness, or you will be asked to leave.  My friend and I are still confused several hours later.  It is enough to cause you to wonder whether prejudice against lesbians is justified (which I doubt is actually their goal in life) but being  unwelcome as a straight man is a new experience.  I will never go back and will be frequently any of the various other bars in Montreal as a result.
