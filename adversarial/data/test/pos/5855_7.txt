Ok. Gave weekend breakfast here a second try today, and I'll stick to weekday kitchen service from now on.  Ordered the Coconut-almond French toast the \"new\" way since Nov. 23rd's version https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=jmx43yTPwP6mUTdA2v_Z6w&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA was excellent (I usually request thinner slices), but the two whole slices of brioche in today's  version weren't sliced into triangles, so the pieces did not absorb enough of the delicious custard, PLUS the slices were burnt!  Not too much that I wanted them redone, but I definitely thought about asking!\n\nI did meet someone interesting to talk to-  just struck up a conversation with Kelly, who sat next to me at the outdoor bar counter...\n\nIf dining alone, or with one or two people and don't mind sitting outdoors and at the bar, plan to arrive between 10 and 10:15 am.  Maybe I was lucky, but Kelly said Sunday is usually less hectic than Saturday, which was the day I took my out-of-town guests here this past spring and encountered more than an hour-long wait.  There was a long line of people waiting for tables at 10:40 am today.\n\nJust an aside, Mom enjoyed the scramble version of the Dr. \"Art\" Mollen frittata. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=dNkk2sg6gWh22XvNyQVc_A&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  There was an upcharge of $2 for the goat cheese and $2.50 for a buttermilk pancake (replacing the included biscuit). https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=hN3lQfXGU5hWi4Mgva_FvQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA
