Allow me to preface this review - I hate leaving negative feedback for any business, as a business owner myself and someone who has volunteered to serve the business community for 10+ years.  Sadly, this situation warrants blasting them instead of having fun, but I like to have fun.\n\nRockhouse, where do we even begin? Maybe your name should have warned us? Ever since the 80's the LAPD has been trying to knock places with this name down with the batterram; I guess they missed this one due to the terrible location in the middle of 2 major resort properties hidden in the frightfully designed mall?\n\nTuesday night (12\/19\/17) After taking a Lyft ride over from Elara where we were staying; we trekked from Palazzo through the cavernous, empty and rather pointless mall towards Rockhouse; excited to redeem our groupon after a lackluster evening the night before at ameriCAN bar at the Linq. After walking nearly half an hour (no exaggeration, really) we finally found Rockhouse.  We were dying of thirst and hungry.  All the TV's in front were on, even though the glorified garage door was down.  Wife said \"oh wow they are closed\"; I am the eternal optimist and said \"maybe just the mall bar is closed since the mall is so empty?\" We were both half right; we tried the large door to the left of the mall bar, it was OPEN!  We excited went in, there was music on!  Several feet into the bar it was evident they were closed even though we were clearly inside the building.  There were what appeared to be those \"bottled water cone cup\" paper cone things over all the bottles in the well and on the shelf. I suggested to my wife that since we were there for an open bar promo, maybe this place just had a self-service vibe and things were just slow? (some all inclusive resorts have self-service bars after all) However, I looked at the website (gotta love smartphones) and found that the hours are \"closed at 10 on mon\/tues\" so figured there would be no \"livening up\" tonight. So beside the pathetic nature of drinking alone (although I really did wanna play shuffleboard with her) and missing out on the social nature of a bar; we made the more reasonable choice and left without messing with anything - did I mention there was NO SIGNAGE outside about being shut down for the holidays?  Oh yea I didn't mention that but indeer there was NOT (nor any mention on social media or the website) Wound up having an underwhelming dinner at PrimeBurger and getting a Lyft elsewhere. Thanks for that unnecessary $17 in rides that night. I also made a madbro post on their social media about being closed, no response even today, Saturday, as I write this review. (although they did finally post on the 21st that they are \"closed till the 26th\" wow great job guys!!\n\nAfter a rather extensive search of social media, we decided Wednesday night would be better!  Maybe people had called off or maybe there was a private event scheduled on Tuesday and execution was just off.  We learned there is a live band on Wednesdays and Rockhouse is open till 2am!  The addition of a cheap open bar special meant there should be plenty of new friends to hang out with - ok let's go!! Whip out the phone, hail the driver, and crawl into the prius or other subcompact you deal with lol.  This time we went to the Venetian to see if hopefully the map was right and the walk was shorter. (I am disabled with a below knee amputation and all the walking of Vegas was starting to get to me a bit) My guess regarding the walk distance was maybe right maybe wrong...I swear this place is exactly in the middle.  Especially loved the overly aggressive people from Tahiti Village we had to fend off at 2 points in the mall from this direction - real upscale Mr. Adelson. Once we vanquished the crusaders, and crossed the river (canal) and crested the mountains; we found Rockhouse again.  CLOSED and locked up tight this time. Right after we started walking away, this casually dressed guy came out.  I approached him and asked him what was going on with the place? I was starting think they got busted by ABC for serving minors or something and was really curious. He explained \"oh, you know we are closed for the holiday\" (I guess we look like locals?) I was all \"nah bruh, I don't know, but I do now\". I then griped at him about the lack of notification and he could only muster a \"not my job\". Another $17 in rides and tons of unnecessary walking, all because someone can't be bothered to post notice on the website, social media, or AT THE VENUE.\n\nSo now our week long trip is over, we have this Rockhouse Groupon we can not use, nor do we recommend anyone get it; or waste their time going there. Probably as sad and pathetic as their other place ameriCAN where they write your name on and make you use the same cup all night with the threat of $5 if you lose or break it? We have previously gone to PBR at PH, which is kinda cool and has nice staff.
