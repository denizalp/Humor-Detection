The Hippies thought they could fool me...the Hippies thought I wouldn't see their little trick with the profile change.\n\nI haven't been stoned in a very long time...I pay attention!\n\nSo, since the hippies were good enough to change their Yelp profile to avoid these previous reviews, I think I'll post this one under the new profile.\n________________________________________________________\n\nA friend of mine called  and said \"let's have lunch!\"\n\nHe seemed so excited...and then he said \"hey, buddy...there's a brand new Two Hippies near Old Town!\"\n\nI threw up in my mouth a little and said \"but I don't think these Two Hippies joints are very good\"\n\nHe promised this time the experience would be better!\n\nHe's a lying sack of...well, you get my drift.\n\nI went anyway and had essentially the identical experience to my last (and I do hope this is my last) experience with the Two Hippies.\n\nNot surprising that this place is identical...the very same franchisee operates it (in the location once occupied by the late,and not apparently lamented in the slightest, Desert Dogs and Dessert), that operates the other Two Hippies Joints that I've tried.\n\nTwo Hippies is recycling the very same thing over and over!\n\nOh well.\n\nAnd except for the actual physical location and the fact that I had a pretty flavorless burrito instead of tacos, recycling the same review that I used before works stunningly well for this location, too!\n\nAnd it's appropriate since Two Hippies seems intent on recycling their formula, ad nauseum.\n\nVery \"green\" of them (except of course for the styro and plastic everything else).\n\nPlus, I'm feeling lazy today (or green...I can't remember which).\n\nHere is the review, for those of you still reading:\n\n\"I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)\n\nI hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-I\n\nBut I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)\n\nAnd, I like taco's:)\n\nAnd I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer \"My Day\", sadly:(\n\nBut I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(\n\nI got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)\n\nI didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)\n\nThose are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably \"taco de playa\" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)\n\n10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)\n\nNo beach at 5th and Camelback:(\n\nBut, I digress:)\n\nI liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)\n\nI really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's \"outrageous\" in any sense of the word:)\n\nAlthough nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.\n\nSo I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!\n\nHey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...\n\nThat would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)\n\nBut no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(\n\nIn Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(\n\nThere are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)\"
