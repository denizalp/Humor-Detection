wanted to try this place because of kichen nightmares, I don't always believe everything on on reallity TV shows. It was every  thing Gordon Ramsey said it was. Waited forever to get my food, the pasta was frozen bland tasting. My pasta was still cold in the center so i returned it and that was when i was attacked. amy came out and said i was wrong she check it before it went out and i was crazy . Never had any problem at any other restaurant returning anything. Just a overall bad experience
