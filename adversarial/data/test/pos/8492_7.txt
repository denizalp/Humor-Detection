three words: Pre Paid Electric.\n\nI love SRP and could not complain even if i tried to. They have a pre paid electric option and of course i jumped right on that. No surprise bill at the end of the month, you pay what you want as the month goes on $10 here $50 here, whatever you want\/need to put on. You keep a nifty little box in your house that manages your monthly usage. Even breaks  down the usage by hour and day. I love knowing EXACTLY how much i am spending. You get a card to go with the box and you can load the card at any local SRP express location( in grocery stores) and insert the card into your box at home and BAM just like that bill is paid. \n\ni don't know about you but I'm all about convenience :)
