Dear Rodney must be visiting a different Giant Eagle on Day Dr. then I've been heading to weekly for the past 5 years. Even in it's new location, not much as changed - it's a mixed bag of quality and service. Sometimes the produce is fine, fresh lettuce, crisp apples; and sometimes it's not. More often than not its a search through the bin for a bell pepper that's not bruised and shriveled and on more than one occasion I've picked up a piece of rotting fruit or sprouted potato.\n\nI can't really comment on the quality of the meat these days because I stopped buying meat here a long time ago favoring the cheaper prices and better quality found at the West Side Market. The deli counter meat is fresh, but the employees do always seem like they'd rather be slicing their hands off than slicing meat. \n\nThe store is generally well organized although they do tend to stock at random hours and it's not unusual for the stock persons to leave their large carts out in the middle of aisle making it difficult to get by. \n\nI do appreciate the new breads area (when they leave the loaves whole) and cheese shop. Yes, I live in Parma and buy expensive cheese. Go figure. It's nice to be able to grab a block of Gruyere and have fresh crusty bread without needing to head to the WSM. \n\nUltimately, I am too lazy to drive to Heinen's and too sane to go to Marc's so I deal with the Giant Eagle. The Fuel Perks make it just a little more bearable.
