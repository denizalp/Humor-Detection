It's your basic Las Vegas casino...nothing fancy. If I get food here it's typically Chin Chins...because of the sexy hostess that works there and their food is pretty good!! Lol Or the Starbucks.\n\nThe bar under the Statue of Liberty light sucks...but that's due to TERRIBLE service. \n\nChin chins and Starbucks...outside of that, you're on your own!
