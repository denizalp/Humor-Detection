It was already scorching hot here in AZ and I wanted to stop at the Coffee shop for an ice cold drink.  I just got into town and my friend was driving into Scottsdale area.  \nI looked up the coffee places on Yelp on my phone and luckily found several Coffee shops on 5th Ave.  \nI'm glad I walked into this place out of many Coffee shops in the neighborhood after having their tasty **cookies(Chocolate\/Peanut\/Bacon & White Chocolate\/ Macadamia) and a delicious **Chai iced latte w\/soy milk :P. Their Chai iced latte was one of the best I've ever tried before!!\n\nIt's a \"trendy\" coffee shop type of place. When I walked in, there were several people  sit around either working on their laptops or reading books.  I really like their very modern style of mismatched colorful furniture.  I enjoy the chalkboard menus on the wall as well.  It seems like they serve quiet a few selection of beers and foods:)  To my surprise and amazement, they had an alcohol beverage and keep in mind, this is a coffee shop. Most notable Wow, I would never thought this place might sell beer... \n\nA place to come and do some work on your laptop sipping coffee and then transition to beers later in the day-sounds awesome!!  Maybe some people might think it doesn't look exactly a beer destination place, but I can see myself having a glass of cold beer on a hot summer night :P.  Definitely, it's a relaxing spot to enjoy a pint, or less in my case.\n\nDon't forget., thumbs up for the Chai Latte!
