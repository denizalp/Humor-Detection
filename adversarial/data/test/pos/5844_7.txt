This place gets packed quite often so expect to bring cash to tip the valet! This place is so aesthetically pleasing inside and outdoor seating. The marble tables and the white tiled walls make it very fitting. I would have never expected to enjoy good seafood like this living in the desert. I went during happy hour aka the best hour since is $1 oysters and shrimp. I ordered a dozen oysters and it looked so appetizing. The garlic wedge fries were also a great side but you gotta try the hush puppies. Slightly crunchy and soft. I'm definitely going to be going here much more often.
