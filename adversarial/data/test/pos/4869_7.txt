Burgers were amazing. Shakes were amazing. All had very nice presentation. Were filling. \n\nI had kobe beef for the first time, someone else in our group ordered \"regular\" beef. Honestly couldn't really tell the difference. So might not be worth the upgrade, especially for a burger.\n\nWould have been 5 stars except the waiter\/service was horrible.
