Will not be going back. The food itself wasn't bad, I liked the drunken noodles but my boyfriend had a curry dish with fried noodles that were clumped together, greasy and uncooked in the middle. What was bad was the actual running of the place.\n\nAfter ordering our food we heard loud throat clearing and hacking coughing coming from the kitchen. I'm convinced the person cooking our food was back their spitting out phlegm, my boyfriend thinks it was the delivery guy in the restroom. Regardless, we were the only guests in the restaurant so it was definitely one of the employees which is disgusting- if you need to make those noises go out back where no one can hear you or better yet stay home, rest and come back well- you are working with food.\n\nThe other disappointing thing is that we were the only ones in the restaurant and it took almost a full hour to get two noodle dishes. \n\nSo although the drunken noodles was good, we both agreed it was the better of the two; I felt uneasy eating it due to the phlegm noises coming from somewhere. We won't be coming back.
