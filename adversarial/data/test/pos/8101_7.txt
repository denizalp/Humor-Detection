This place makes a bad reflection on Korean people and its FN pathetic!\n\nIf you are a party of 2, PRAY TO GOD you dont get the skinny Korean guy with glasses!\n\nHe hates his job, no personality, doesnt like to serve, and oh god if you ask for water, he'll look at you and doesnt say a damn word.\n\nI hate to leave bad reviews, the food is ok, SERVICE JUST PLAIN SUCKS!\n\nBut for all the other servers, they ARE NOT attentive, they dont care, typical EFFIN asian place.\n\nYOU SIT, YOU EAT, YOU PAY, YOU REEVE!\n\nLast straw with them, Ill be at Hodori.
