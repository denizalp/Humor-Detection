Locale has been serving King City for close to three years, and it's still going strong.\nLocated right at keele and king road amongst a few other cute restaurants side by side.\nThe interior is warm with the dim lights, wood and rustic furniture truly gives truly gives this place a cozy feel.\nOn a warm night our party decided to hit a patio, and was it beautiful, spacious and clean.\nFor food, we rated it a 3\/5, their mezze mezze was a bit disappointing due to the choices of cheese and selection of meat.\nThe margarita pizza we ordered which was okay...perhaps add more diversity of cheese to the pizza.\nFor dessert we shared their crema de limone, served with a chocolate biscotti was quite satisfying. 4\/5\n\nOverall If you're looking for drinks in a nice area whether it be indoor or outdoor seating, this is a great place. However in terms of food, it's OKAY.
