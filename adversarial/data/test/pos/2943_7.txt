The \"R.J. Review for Best in Las Vegas\" stickers aren't theirs, it belonged to the restaurant that was there before them and I assume they leave it up to scam people into thinking their quality is good.\n\nI came in here and sat down, no one greeted me or came up to me, I was the only person in the place and there were clearly atleast two workers who noticed me and ignored me. Waited about 2 minutes before walking out and going across the street to get sushi. I guess this place doesn't like making money.
