Okay, maybe it's because I'm from the Pacific Northwest but this place just seemed sad to me.  There are pumpkins, yes this is true, but it seemed like just a small tent of pumpkins.  The rides, the sad ponies, and the sad excuse for food....made this place seem lack luster to me.  Go to Gilcrease Orchards if you want a real fall\/pumpkin experience.  For this part of town, I expected more.  The parking was convenient and at least there are good food options nearby.
