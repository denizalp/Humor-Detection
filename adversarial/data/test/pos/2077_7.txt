How can you be in a customer service industry if you don't smile to your guests, you don't welcome them, or you don't thank them for being there! That's how cashier KIM was! \n\nI got to the window, she didn't talk, nor even said hi nor asked me what I need. So I started by saying, I need 3 tickets, 2 adults, 1 child. She then said \"ok, $54.\" I was in the process of getting my Nevada ID when I told her I'm a local, she was like \"ID\". Mind you, still no eye contact!! She looked at my ID, I gave her money, she printed out tickets, handed them to me. I stayed at the window for a few more seconds while I put my stuff away. She did not even say \"Thank you\" nor \"Enjoy\" !! Like really girl?! HAHAHA. I can't believe it. I don't care if she's having a bad day, she just ruined mine! I work in the same industry, so I don't understand this gal's attitude.\n\nAnyway, we went for the haunted reef and we really enjoyed despite of \nKIM's unpleasant attitude.\n\nThe staff giving away candies were really nice and generous!
