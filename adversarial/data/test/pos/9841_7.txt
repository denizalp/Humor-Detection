Love it when I can just stick my thumb in something round and heavy then toss it in a lane that's just gleaming. Letting that ball roll and wham!!! Strike all pins down!!! A great score everytime and what aaaah feeling!! That's bowling when I got the time, free of other daily activity. A time for just stretching out those muscles and let free. \n\nThis bowling lanes within the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino remains to be a favorite place not just for hotel guests and me but for locals and tourists alike.
