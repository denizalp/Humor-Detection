What can I say about this club that hasn't already been said? I've been coming here for about 7 months now, and I like it. It's a HUGE gym - probably double the size of the gym I used to go to when I lived in the Bay Area.\n\nPros:\n- Indoor track\n- Good selection of machines\n- Separate free weights area\n- Fairly clean\n- Adequate number of lockers\n- Friendly staff\n- Decent variety of group classes\n- Occasional celebrity sightings\n- Good juice bar\n- Great for people watching\n- Conveniently located 5 minutes from home; 10 minutes from the office\n- Probably the biggest plus - the price: $22 a month + some change\n\nCons:\n- Crowded most of the time\n- Parking lot is congested (I still manage to get a good spot every time)\n- A good number of ego-maniacal meatheads and diva wannabe's\n- Having to sometimes workout next to someone with a serious B.O.\/ halitosis problem\n\nIt serves it's purpose well. Until I find a good boxing gym nearby, this will be my regular workout place.
