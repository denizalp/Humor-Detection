This review is NOT FOR FOOD but for the fact that they sell $.99 water bottles here.\n\nAgain, $.99 water bottles here. Walk in, go straight and on your right you will find delicious, life-sustaining, hangover-curing, vital-in-ridiculous-desert-heat, CHEAP WATER. \n\nNo tax or anything, so bring in a buck and get a lucky penny (you're going to need it) and a bottle of water.
