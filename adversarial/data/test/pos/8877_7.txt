The worst meal I had in Vegas. \nThat's disappointing because I like Toby Keith. But I can unequivocally say, I hate this bar. \nWe had been out all day sightseeing and we needed a decent supper before bed. Harrah's has a bar that is themed after a Toby Keith song. I love this bar. So it looked kind of slow but there were folks eating at several tables. We have eaten at several of the restaurants  in the casino and they've been good. We got seated as we walked up and the waiter came and took our order. Hot wings for her and Fish and chips for me. When they brought her wings they left off the ranch. My order was complete but not completely fried. The breading on the cod fish was not crisp. It was soggy and a little runny on the inside. I took a bite and it was super hot temp wise. But the whole thing fell apart like it had been dunked in water. All of the fish were like this. The fries and slaw were good. As far as the wings went. They were still partly frozen. I grabbed the tip of the wing on one and it was literally cold to the touch. After spending the day in death valley, I'm very aware what hot vs. cold is. This was poor execution of what should be a simple fried order. \nOne more thing. The sweet tea was way too sweet. Don't get me wrong,  I love sweet tea. I'm a southern guy and I've had sweet tea since I was 3 probably. I like it sweet. But not this sweet. Maybe you shouldn't even try to be southern, Vegas.
