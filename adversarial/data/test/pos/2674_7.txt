I called from out of state VERY interested in a 335i they had listed on cars.com.  I made an offer to the woman speaking on the phone with me, and she told me: \"I don't mean to rush you off the phone, but I have other people to tend to, because that is not a serious offer.\"  \n\nBtw- the car is listed at 27,8k, I offered 26,5k.  Haha that's not an unreasonable offer, whatsoever.  \n\nANY dealer, ANY dealer can take AT LEAST 500-1000 off.  If they couldn't, they wouldn't be in business.  \n\nLost that sale.  Losers.
