Props to Ricco for handling my crazy family.  He was patient, humorous, and calm.  He got Eric R. the peppermint schnapps shake that was \"discontinued\" after Christmas but was able to get all of the ingredients to the bartender to make it happen.  I got the rising sun (apparently Ricco's fave burger) and it was deeeeelicious! It was beef with furikake, tempura avocado, yam strips, spicy mayo.  Everyone got their burgers made to order and they came out hot and fast.  I was impressed with the food but mostly with the service.  If you go, ask for Ricco's section!
