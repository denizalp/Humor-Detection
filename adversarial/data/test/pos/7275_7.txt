I'm boogying down a bucket list of things I have yet to do. Item number six sillily was one of the scariest: try going really blonde. \n\nIt took two goes, the magic and patience of Stephan (my new hair hero) and a whole lot of conditioner, but voila! I am blonde. I am also now a loyal customer to not only this place, but this tall, sunny hair expert. \n\nIf you haven't signed a blood signature with your current stylist, you should really try Parlour. Lovely, on trend folks that won't let you down.
