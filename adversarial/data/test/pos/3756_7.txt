Never had a bad meal here.  We always like to go here when we want to eat ' fast food ', as in no table service,  and healthy. \n\nSpouse always gets the barbacoa burrito and I alternate between that or the sofritas (seasoned,  minced tofu).\n\nI love watching the always friendly staff pile on all the fixing liberally.  Everything is free except for the guac. But don't skimp on it!  It's the best tasting guacamole you'll ever have besides making your own.
