A deli-licious update! The service here was excellent and the Italian gentleman at the counter was giving out sample stromboli pieces that he had just baked which were heavenly. I shared some braciole and a #9 capicola\/sopressata sandwich on homemade bread. The bread was superb this time, with a slightly crisp outer surface and soft delicious interior. The beef was very tender and flavorful in the braciole, and the cold sandwich was the perfect amount of meat, vegetables, and condiments. My friends had lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs which we all oohed and ahhed over. Everything was perfection. The only thing we regret was not having enough room in our stomach for some dessert! Upgrade one star!
