I finally made it in to Hadley's for brunch.  They only open at 11:30, which made it easy to secure seats as the first customers of the day.  Although we could have sat anywhere, we chose to sit at the bar, nice and close to the owners - Eric and Lex.  Lex was able to chat with us while preparing several spicy Caesars, brewing coffee and serve others.  I love multi-taskers.\n\nI was starving and decided on The Remedy for my first meal of the day.  I knew it would be too much food for me, but was up for the challenge.  The deep fried eggs were crispy and greasy, which is how I like my breakfast.  The beans, pulled pork and hash it was served on were all delicious as well.  What a combo!  The slaw and apples on the side were refreshing compared to the heavy hearty core.\n\nWhat a fantastic way to start my day!  I wasn't hungry for hours.
