I hate to buck the trend, since I have no doubt the Cultured Pearl is a fabulous dining experience. Unfortunately I did not stay after our server, who was very pleasant, informed us they were not serving alcohol the remainder of the night, and probably the rest of the weekend. We appreciated the notice and took our business elsewhere.\n\nAn AZ Liquor Control Board infraction is the only thing this could be, which must have occurred just before we had arrived because everyone else was nursing drinks.\n\nThere is no excuse for this. Lack of training, and ignorance of liquor laws is a lethal combination for any restaurant, and particularly one in an area of such a young demographic. Loss of revenue plus fines. Ouch!\n\nI will hopefully improve my rating after my next visit, but in the meantime, this 1-star review will serve as a reminder of what happens when you get lazy and don't abide by principles.
