I keep wanting to call this place Fist of Fury, one of my fav Bruce Lee movies. \n\nDecent little spot for Hawaiian\/Filipino fusion food. I haven't really tried their Filipino inspired items yet so I can't comment on that. \n\nMy favorite is definitely their garlic shrimp bowl. It's packed with the garlicky flavor, and they give you a generous amount of shrimp. \n\nRecently, I tried their garlic chicken wings, and they were amazing! It had the right amount of sweetness, and it was perfectly crisp on the outside. It was their weekly special, but I'm really hoping that they put in on the menu for good. I also had their kalbi (short rib) bowl. It had good flavor, but it was really chewy, almost like jerky. My friend commented that the short ribs at a lot of places here in Vegas are generally chewy so I won't knock them too much for that. \n\nThey also serve elotes, including one covered in Hot Cheetos or even rainbow Cheetos called the uni-corn. \n\nPrices are reasonable, and the food is good. You really can't go wrong here.
