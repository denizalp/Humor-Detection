I'm very happy that we finally have this amazing theatre opened up in my area!! The place is super nice and clean. The service is great and staff was is super friendly. \n\nWhat this theater has that not many others offer is an awesome bar close to the concession stands. I thought that was a nice touch in case people wanted a drink while waiting for their movie showtime. Good call on this one Harkins! \n\nI love how they let you pick your seats when purchasing your tickets. This way everyone is guaranteed their seats. It would make seating easier especially when going with a group of people. We don't have to feel rushed trying to buy food and heading into save seats. Another great thing is that their seats recline, an amazing feature to have. I get to lay back, eat my popcorn and enjoy my movie as if I'm right in my living room. The tickets only cost a little more than other theaters do, but its worth every penny of it. From now on, this is my go to theater!! Come try them out!!!
