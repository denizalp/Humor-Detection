This Dollar Tree calls an abandoned Fresh & Easy store its home, so the space is quite large. Out of all the Dollar Tree stores in town, I'd say this one lands right about in the middle. It's big so the aisles are wide and spacious, but the stock is just average (your favorite Dollar Tree finds probably won't be stocked here). It's not one of the better dollar stores in town, but it's worth a stop if you're on this side of the city. Easy parking too.
