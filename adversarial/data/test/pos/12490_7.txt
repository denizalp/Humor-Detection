Consistency, variety and accessibility make this place awesome. They have a lot of different cookies, pastries, omelettes, and crepes. Great for breakfast, events, meetings, a hostess gift, etc.\n\nI find myself frequenting La Boulangerie more and more frequently - each new pastry I try opens my eyes further to the Calgary patisserie scene. The crepe hot plate used to prepare crepes and omelettes is authentic and a nice way to take this place for a spin! \n\nMy go-to here is the lemon ricotta pastry and their AMAZING coconut bran muffin. Pretty amazing considering that I don't really care for coconut flavoured anything.
