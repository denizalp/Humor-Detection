I give this place four stars for the convenient location of a gas station addition.  It's hardly ever busy.  I also like that it is so easy to pay cash because the cashier is always open, accessible and well lit for safety.  Since I suck at couponing, I went shopping here for foodstuffs to donate to my fave food bank.  For every $100 dollars spent,  I got $.20 cents off per gallon!  You have to have a Fry's card, of course.
