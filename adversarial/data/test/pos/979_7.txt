I can't even with this place. \nI've actually given them multiple chances considering how close I live to their location. The first time we tried this franchise they took our order down wrong. I don't just mean that we called in. We walked over and repeated our order to the clerk 4 times. She still recorded it incorrectly. Needless to say, we were disappointed. \nIn that same experience a gentleman came up to the counter to tell the clerk he just received his pizza and it was \"100% raw\". I saw the pizza and can confirm that it was raw. I don't know why, but we went back. This time we just flat out received the wrong order. \nTonight I was walking home from work and thought \"maybe they've had training. Maybe they'll be better\". This time we were just flat out ignored. The clerk just kept sweeping while we stood there waiting for help. Guys, never go here. It's outrageously horrible.
