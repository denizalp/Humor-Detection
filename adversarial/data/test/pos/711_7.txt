Every time I've been here it's always been busy even at 5 which is when they open. I always sit at the sushi bar, it has the best & fastest service. I've been here about 4 times now and it kills me that I don't remember the sushi chefs' names but my favorites are the hispanic chef and the Hawaiian chef! They always remember & take care of me and are so helpful. \n\nI pretty much only eat nigiri on my AYCE adventures so I can't really comment on any of the rolls. All of the fish are always fresh & delicious and the great thing is that they don't pack on the rice! \nI'm not a huge fan of the pork belly side dish but the hamachi kama is a winner! They also have Monta ramen available but trust you don't want to be filling up on noodles when there's sushi to be eaten lol Make sure to always check their Specials board for what's hot on the menu for that day! \n\nThey have a really good dessert menu and you can sample each one! My favorite is the lychee sorbet, simple yet refreshing and it satisfies my sweet tooth! \n\nI love this place because it's clean, the quality is great and the service is amazing! So be sure to take care of your sushi chefs and servers! \n\nAlso make sure to get a stamp card because at $26.95 you want to get ALL your money's worth ;)
