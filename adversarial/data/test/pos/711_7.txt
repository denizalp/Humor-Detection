This is normal, Americanized Mexican food, but at a price point that is appropriate for resturants at Market Square. Expect to pay $30\/head for tacos and a drink.\n\nIt looks nice, the service is nice, the view is nice, and expect to pay for it. Not the food. Got tacos and so did me hombre. Tortillas were stale. Spanish rice & beans were nothing special. There are way better values in the Square. There are way better Mex places in the Burgh. \n\nTL;DR: The food there is disappoint.
