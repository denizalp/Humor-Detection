Late night eats and homemade food. Always a good bet.\n\nBlueberry Hill has an extensive menu full of diner food and lots of friendly staff. I almost always get breakfast when I come. It's hard to find a solid breakfast place and this one fits the bill. \n\nSo what, it's a chain, but if you're in the mood for french toast at 2am, this is definitely the answer and you'll always be pleased. \n\nAside from breakfast, they have fantastic dinner specials, desserts and plenty of other delights to indulge in. I have liked everything I've ever tried here. I'll be back, as always.
