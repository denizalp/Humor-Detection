Dreamy rich and smooth..that it is. Im not going to elaborate on all the flavors I tried but just say everything was great!  On my second visit the standouts were the Mango Sorbet and the Amarena Cherry. The depth of the mango flavor was insane and rightfully so since they are imported from India. Mr. B kept going on and on how it was the best ever.\n  \nLove that the gelato is au naturale; no additives or artificial flavorings and ingredients like the eggs are organic. \n\nThe price which is an issue with many, I really didn't have a problem with. Honestly I didnt have any idea or paid attention to how much. We just forked over $4o cause bestie got us a dozen gelato filled macarons!  I felt the price is in line for the demographic of people who shop at the surrounding high end shops. It's right across from the Apple Store for goodness sakes!  People seem to easily fork over $$ for their electronic gizmos over there. So six bux should be chump change right??\n\nMy issue is with the texture. While I love the creaminess, the darn thing was a bit soft and ended up dripping and melting too fast. And it was 5o degrees sitting outside on the patio. We sat there and Mr. B told me to hurry up and eat it before it turned soupy. I HATE being rushed when eating my food. The place is just a little boutique set up, not much in the way of seating inside. It's take and go. So imagine having gelato outdoors during the Spring and Summer seasons here.  \n\nThen there's the gelato flower issue. They are known for making beautiful designs when you order a cone. People come here for that.  My flower cone looked pretty, but it took a bit longer for the servers to make, hence was starting to drip as soon as my gelato was handed to me. The first visit my 3 scoop gelato slipped off the cone. Luckily I acted quickly and it landed over my shopping bag that I moved under before it went splat. Scooped it back up and happily ate it.  Second visit I ordered a cone again hoping for the beautiful designed flower but halfway thru making my flower the employee stopped because she was having a difficult time creating it. She was very apologetic and said the sorbet wasnt going to hold up.  She also added that they had customers who had problems with their cones ...she didn't elaborate on the problems but I knew why. So I took up her suggestion and had my order in a cup instead.\n\nSOLID FOUR stars for sure on the gelato alone. But because MY overall experience fell off and fell short. Three stars for now.  It may sound trivial but I want that dang flower cone. Hopefully a third visit here will be a charm.
