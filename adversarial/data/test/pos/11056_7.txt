There are so many other shopping choices in Vegas.  This mall is not high on my list, but since it's the closest mall to the Northwest part of Las Vegas, where I live, I shop here two or three times a year.  This past weekend, I was searching for a UNLV Football Jersey.  Because I didn't want to drive all the way across town, I stopped here.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the mall from my perspective:\n\nPROS\n- It's conveniently located off US-95 and can be accessed via two exits, Valley View Blvd or Decatur.\n\n- There is a parking area on the North part of the mall that has the fewest number of cars and will get you in\/out of the center of the mall.  Very easy access.\n\n- They renovated the mall a few years back and it's relatively clean.  Much nicer than it was 5-10 yrs ago.\n\n- They have a Front Row Sports, which was the main reason for coming here, that has a great selection of sports clothing & jerseys.\n\nCONS\n- It's not in a great neighborhood and coming here at night is not advised.\n\n- I wouldn't purchase anything expensive here, see point above.\n\nThe two Cons are pretty big, but if you have some common sense you can navigate through those....like I said I only come here when I'm too lazy to drive across town.\n\nWill I return?  I probably will.
