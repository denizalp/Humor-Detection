I felt that I would share with others my experience. Bs West has been the hot spot for quite the years . They are well known and they get quite packed ! The drinks are amazing and not bad priced. You must be thinking wow this place sounds good ? Well it's not let me share the horrible experiences I've had . \n\nThe staff are the rudest staff anyone could encounter ! The first bad encounter was on my birthday where we went in a limo and paid the cover to get in . We were in the bar for about 10 minutes till one of the staff members kick my group out because they said we were rude on out way in ! Really ? The second time was the last for me ! I ordered A drink on the outside patio from the cocktail waiter . When he came back he had all of my friends and my drinks . While we were getting the money to pay him he riped the drinks from our hands and said you have cash ready or no drink ! I told him that he was rude and we were getting the cash as my friend was holding the money in his hand . He said you wanna see rude I'll show you how rude I can be when your out of here ! I advised the cocktail waiter he can have his drinks and we were leaving ! Me and my friends will never return and will spread the word on the staff bring rude ! \nWith out customers you don't have a bar ! If your staff feels they are so power happy to kick people out no one will go back. Please be ware everyone !
