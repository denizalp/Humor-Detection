I will NEVER come back here again, my rep was Rolando \n\n1st..I had to type all my info the computer into his office because he was too busy eating a sandwich in my face. \n\nEVERYTHING Rolando had to do related to my sale was a chore..a hassle..an inconvenience \n\nI work too hard for my money to spend it somewhere that will treat you any kind of way. \n\nthis place lacks professionalism and will not succeed if other people are treated the way I  was today
