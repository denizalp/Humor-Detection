**UPDATE** So after looking looking at their staff page on the company website - if it is current the floor sales manager that was rude to me was Louis. On Friday morning the SECOND sales manager - Joe called me and said sorry but to come back and \"we will make the experience better\" and then hung up. A few hours after that my salesperson Steve called to check in and that was nice but I was still not ready as I work M-F from 7-7ish. This morning Scott called me to check in and today I'm slammed with Easter clients I just simply don't have the time to come in. So after getting to sleep on my decision for two nights and after a few hours from Scott's call I've decided to NOT buy the Kia Niro as I had hoped for from Findlay Kia (to the least) due to the way I was treated by Louis the Floor Sales Manager. The only way Findlay Kia can get me to even step foot on their property ever again is if Findlay himself calls me to apologize for his employee's horrible behavior and lack of customer service skills. When I bought my Ford Fiesta I met Team Ford's owner and he treated me with Respect. Findlay will have to do the same to earn my business. So until then....it's back to car searching unless I decide to drive the extra miles to the other Kia dealerships in town. **
