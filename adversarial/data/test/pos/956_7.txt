Mercadito initially rolled out their marketing with the slogan, \"The Best Thing To Come Out Of Mexico Since Salma Hayek\", which sadly built up a hype that didn't really deliver once you dined here. The drinks are crazy-strong but the food portions and pricing are a little ridiculous for the off-Strip location.\n\nStreet tacos aren't bad: Baja and carne asada are both really tasty, but unless you have some sort of comp or discount, the portion isn't worth the price. Adding on a side of chips and guac is always a good idea, but the pina is a lot better than the traditional, which has a spicy kick some might not appreciate.\nAs for drinks, lots of different margaritas are available with flavors and spice levels, but the Little Market drink seems to be my favorite while the Misty Sleeve is my guy's. \n\nCheck the website for discount HH times, they also have an industry night for those who qualify. The tacos are tasty and the drinks are strong but I won't pay full price for either of them here.
