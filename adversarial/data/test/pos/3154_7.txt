This is a great sandwich shop for a quick lunch in downtown Calgary.  They feature \"artisan\" sandwiches with fresh ingredients, unique flavor combinations, and nicely baked bread.\n\nI did their lunch combo, which got me a sandwich, salad, chips, and drink for approx. $13 USD.  Not bad at all!  The salad was decent and their chips (I think made in house?) are pretty good, but the star was definitely the sandwich!\n\nI ordered the jerk chicken sandwich and this was really tasty.  Plentiful amount of well-seasoned and spiced jerk chicken, which was nicely balanced by the sweet mango salsa.  The bread was light and fluffy.  Portions were just about right - not too much filling to make the sandwich unwieldy, but also not too much bread to make it feel like you were chewing cardboard.\n\nOVERALL: 4\/5.  For a casual and quick lunch option, this place makes some great sandwiches!  If I worked in Calgary and was not just an occasional visitor, I would probably come here frequently for lunch.
