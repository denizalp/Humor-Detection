I don't normally post often but this place is absolute GARBAGE!!!!! I would give it zero stars if I could - 1 star is already too much. I took out steak quesadilla, and to my chagrin, it was BURNT when I opened the box. I posted a picture to the gallery so everyone can witness their audacity to serve crap.\n\nWhat wasn't burnt tasted like Taco Bell anyway, but at least I was never served burnt food at Taco Bell. I am obviously fuming because this restaurant has ruined my Sunday evening and they deserve to get shut down for their audacity to serve crap. DO NOT WASTE ANY DOLLARS ON THIS PLACE!!!!!!!
