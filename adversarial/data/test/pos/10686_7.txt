Eating at Frida has inspired me to stop lurking around on yelp and to hurry up and create an account and review already!\n\nI was there with a group of 10 adults and 2 babies (both very well behaved) and we were treated to a food experience we are still salivating over. We started with an amuse-bouche - compliments of the kitchen - of a shrimp \"cappuccino\".  While the name turned us off, the taste was a real turn-on: it did what exactly an amuse-bouche should do - priming us for the culinary treats that were to come. Next we shared guacamole (very smooth), the ceviche (me: \"omg what IS that!!\"), the melted cheese thing (very poor description for that unctuous goodness), and the duck tacos (5 to a plate - good thing the babies weren't equiped to eat those they would have had rank totally pulled on them). \n\nWhile I enjoyed the chicken main I really should have gone with my first instinct and ordered the lamb that my husband had. Accompanied by a side of lamb consomm√©, the meat was tender, very well seasoned and put over the top with the crumbled fresh cheese topping.   The serving size was generous.\n\nWe had the dessert sampler and true to the previous reviews, the churros are definitely a high-light.  It was my birthday so I was treated to a cocktail from the bar. Now I only wish I thought to remember the name of that deliciousness.  (Something like \"Mexican Rose\"?)\n\nService was fabulous.  Our server's descriptions of the food was right-on.   Convenient Green P lot right beside Frida.\n\nNow looking for another special occasion as an excuse to go back!
