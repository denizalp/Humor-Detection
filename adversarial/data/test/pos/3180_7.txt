Aug. 22, 2015. As a frequent customer to your 9595 S. Eastern Avenue location I was appalled by our experience on Sat. 8\/22\/15 at approx. 7:30 p.m. There was a table of 3 men and a woman. One man was drunk and disorderly. So much so, that a nearby table of adults with young children cancelled their order and left because of their foul language. Myself and my guest were likewise offended. One of the men at the table was permitted to enter and dine in bare feet, which was repulsive. \n\nI called for the manager to ask that he take appropriate action. His comment was \"I've already spoken to them and there was nothing more I could do.\" I mentioned to him about the man being permitted to dine in bare feet and that being a health issue and potentially liability should he step on glass or other foreign matter. He just shrugged his shoulders and said \"I'm sorry.\" \n\nThis manager was approximately 6'3\" and 250 lbs. and seemed frightened to confront and order them to leave. I heard from some of the other dinners and they too were appalled and disgusted that the \"manager\" just let these unruly persons ruin their dinner as well. This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had and will think twice before returning to that location.
