If this place wasn't a staple in Lakewood, it would not survive.  The food isn't very good. Definitely not fresh.  Went for brunch this time.  Oj worse than the generic kind you would buy at a grocery store.  I asked for over medium eggs, and they were barely over easy (very runny).  The bacon was rubbery.  Side note, the owner will not seat you without your entire party present. That includes just 2 people. My boyfriend was parking the car and he would not seat me until he came into the restaurant.  Not very welcoming.  The owner is lucky people come here out if habit and tradition. Not good!
