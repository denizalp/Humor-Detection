Whole Pay Check is a pretty good store, IF you are willing and able to afford to shop here. What I really like about Whole Foods is the quality of their products and the variety. I like the hot food options and the salad bar AND they have one of my favorite wines here. I have had a had time finding good pomegranate wine and Whole Foods has it! I also have been having a hard time finding black and red caviar for sale in Vegas (if you know a store that sells it, please message me!) and Whole Foods has that as well. \nThis location is stocked well and clean. Staff is always friendly.
