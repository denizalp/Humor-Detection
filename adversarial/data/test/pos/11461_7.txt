I simply cannot believe all of these negative reviews. My personal experience with the staff at SFR has been phenomenal, from the receptionist to the maintenance manager. Each and every employee and sub contractor at SFR has been very professional. It's a basic treat folks how you want to be treated kinda thing.  \n\nLeasing agents, Jennifer and Sonya, are VERY accommodating. I am shocked at anyone who says otherwise. I have rented from SFR for close to 4 years and seldom have we needed any repairs\/maintenance done, but when we did, it was handled, quick, fast and in a hurry. \n\nI have a family of five and a Great Dane. BTW, try and find another property management company that will rent to you when you own a Great Dane. My Family and I  have been elated with our house in Henderson.  Even though appliances were included, we bought our own washer\/dryer and refrigerator. Who wants to use someone else's  appliances?\n\nWaste disposal and lawn care costs are the tenants responsibility, just like any homeowner. Remember you are renting a home, not an apartment. Pay your bills and you won't get fined. Pay your rent on time, it's really that simple. \n\nWe were paying $600.00 less per month than a fella who was renting a smaller home (from another property management company), just two houses away from us.  \n\nThe money we saved renting a very nice, cost effective and well maintained house from SFR enabled us to save money for the down payment on our own home.       \n\nBottom line is this, my experience has greatly differed from others who have left negative reviews regarding SFR. Don't let the b.s. reviews deter you from renting from this truly professional company. SFR has been our stepping stone to home ownership.
