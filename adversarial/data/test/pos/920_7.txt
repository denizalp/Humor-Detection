It doesn't get any better than this. Village Discount makes my heart beat faster, and brightens my every visit to the Akron-Canton metropolitan area.  Last time I got two like-new Anthropologie blouses, and an adorable pair of Baby Gap cowboy boots, among other things. Extra points for the christian rock.
