I came in to grab some lunch before I went off to work. It was nice and sunny outside. Pittsburgh nice, at least (30s and sunny). Still....\n\nI looked over the menu and its short and to the point. A handful of fried seafood things, a small collection of non-seafood sandwiches, and some more various fried things. I settled on their special, which is two crabcakes plus two sides. I got the fries and the onion rings. I also orderd an \"original oyster\" which is actually a gigantic hushpuppy with a very tiny oyster inside of it. I was pretty bummed out by that because the two crab cakes were really just basically hushpuppies with a few pieces of crab meat and an occasional piece of krabmeat. Definitely a bummer. The fries and the onion rings were cold. Also a bummer.\n\nEverything tasted okay, I guess. Lots of salt in the crab cakes and oyster. The onion rings, if they were fresh and hot, would have been great. They're freshly made, crunchy and you can actually bite through a piece of the onion and not yank the whole onion out.\n\nThe service though...well..it sucked. The bartender ignored me the entire time I was there. I had drank through almost all of my soda before my plate arrived. And yes you yinzers, I said soda, don't act like you've never heard that one before. After I was done eating, I asked for a refill of my soda. He then disappeared for about 10 minutes, which is just long enough to finish a cigarette and cell phone conversation. Hey, I used to be a waiter, too. I know what you're doing. So after he comes back, he hands me my bill. Then he remembers I asked for a soda 15 minutes ago and finally refills my cup. This is approximately 25 minutes after my plate arrives and my cup was dry the entire time.\n\nOther than that, the place is a dive. I like dives though, so this is no thing. They have a good handful of beers, if that's your pleasure. They only had one type of wine, much to the dismay of those seated right behind me. The food's alright, would have been better if it was hot. And I'm sure if I had just kept it simple and gotten a fish sandwich or fish on a dish, it might have been a decent meal. I probably won't be going back. Its in an inconveniant location, the food is barely even par, and the service is horrible.\n\nAlso..they do not accept cards. Though they do have an ATM (Mack Machine, whatever the yinzfolk call it), outside.
