Taco time!! That is pretty much the only good thing that comes out of this restaurant. It's pretty much just like Pauly D yelling T-SHIRT TIME!! Except that you yell TACO TIME!!!!\n\nOk. Onto the review. A friend took me here. Took one look at the pictures on the menu and did not like what I saw. The pictures of the food made the food look extremely artificial. Well. Figured I'd give it a shot seeing how I was already here and my friend apparently like it here. Well. I'm not really a big hard taco fan so I opted for the soft beef taco and 2 chicken tacos. I do have to say that the pictures look better than the actual food does. Actually, the pictures make the food look so much fresher than the heap of mangled yellow lettuce and soggy tomatoes looked. One bite was all I lasted before this taco went straight to the garbage. \n\nNext up ... the 2 chicken tacos. Decided I would pick away the lettuce and focus my energy on the actual chicken. Put enough hot sauce on this taco burn my stomach lining out. Only thing is, I don't think my stomach could handle the nasty taste of the food going down.\n\nUgh. No thank you.
