I loved the feel of this place.  It was trendy, yet casual, down to earth and easy.  The pizza was awesome.  I loved the crust and I loved that it was ready in less than 5 minutes!\n\nWe tried the pepperoni and the margherita.  They were flavored very well and the red sauce was not too bitter or acidic, which I hate!  It wasn't too greasy, it wasn't too sloppy, it was the perfect crust and great flavoring.  It was fun to watch them literally create the pizza (dough and all) right in front of me.  \n\nI love the fact that you can buy a glass or bottle of wine while dining at one of their family-style tables and you can finish your meal with some of their scrumptious gelato.  Great addition to Charlotte.  The location isn't my favorite and wolfman pizza used to be in this exact location so that concerns me as far as their success is concerned.  But, I think they have what it takes to keep people coming back!  I highly recommend!
