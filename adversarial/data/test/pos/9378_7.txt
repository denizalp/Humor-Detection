Apparently some corporate drone at Yelp didn't like my review composed entirely of rock lyrics because it 'lacked content.' So here's a review your grandparents will approve of.\n\nGee Waly, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame sure was swell! They had a lot of nifty artifacts from the history and pre history of rock and roll! Fun for Jan, Marsha AND Cindy! So many costumes, instruments, and other exhibits, I could stay up past my bedtime just looking at them all. And there are so many rotating exhibits that you can hop in the family station wagon and come back for more wholesome fun again and again! Golly, I could have spent an hour just watching the gee whiz video they had about the history of MTV. So pack up Dick, Jane, Sally and Spot and see this amazing place. You'll be the envy of the school yard!\n\nAnd Yelp, if it's too loud, THEN YOU'RE TOO OLD!
