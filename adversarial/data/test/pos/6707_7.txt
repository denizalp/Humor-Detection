Had a damn fine time at Chef Kerry Simon's downtown tapas-style place. Highlights of our visit were actually the vegetarian and vegetable dishes- would love to see him open a place specializing in that cuisine!\n\nCRISPY CHICKEN SKINS: Not a fan, sorry. Ate two and was done. The salty-fatty-savory-sweet thing just doesn't do it for me. BF inhaled the dish though, and I will admit that it was better than expected. Just not for me.\n\nDEVIL'S EGGS: Deviled eggs plus black caviar plus crispy pancetta? The only downside to this is the sodium, but the flavors are quite good. A bit pricey at $2 per egg half but, hello, caviar. Would get this every visit.\n\nSHORT RIB SLIDERS: Perhaps the least favorite dish of the night. The meat was dry but the root beer glaze flavor was very unique. Tater tots were perfectly crisp and reminiscent of Sonic's but with a slight dusting of seasoning (not enough to call spicy) but felt with all the effort put into the other elements of the dish, the ketchup could have been spiced or at least not cold-straight-from-the-bottle-Heinz. It went untouched. \n\nRAINBOW CAULIFLOWER with garlic and lemon: So help me God this will be a part of my last meal on earth. So much texture and color and flavor, this dish was the star of the night! I cannot rave enough about it, it's a must-order.\n\nROASTED YOUNG BEETS: with pistachio, orange, and goat cheese was the runner-up for favorite dish of the night. Lately every place has a beet dish with citrus and creamy cheese elements, but that doesn't mean this one isn't superb. Shared this with my guy the way other couples might share a dessert. Que romantico, eh? \n\nWILD MUSHROOM FLATBREAD: with caramelized onions and bleu cheese, because the guys across the table from us got it and I wasn't quite in a cheese-coma yet. Very crisp with slight char and great mix of flavors. Can't go wrong with this, simple but well executed.\n\nBOURBON FUDGE BROWNIE: with brown butter bacon ice cream. Holy crap. The brownie wasn't quite what I was expecting and probably had four thousand calories and seventeen cups of sugar in it, but it was good and chewy and was well-accompanied by the ice cream. I preferred the ice cream by far and the mix of flavors and textures was novel. Regardless, I was done after three bites because it was just. too. much. Even BF didn't finish and he's a total glutton. Consider yourself warned.\n\nDÃ©cor was eclectic and I loved the mix of metal and wood materials, industrial feel with quality fixtures. Community tables are a thing here, pretend you're in SF and ignore the couple next to you and get over it or just belly up to the bar.\n\nSuper service from server, busser, and everyone else- great mood evident among staff, all came across as genuine and personable.  I'll be back soon to try the other half of the menu!
