Groupon buyers beware of small print on your coupon's. They will charge you Ohio state tax on the actual full Salon price of whatever Salon services you have purchased.\n\nIn all of my other groupon purchases I have never had to pay this \n\n\nVery rude and unprofessional I would NEVER return to this Salon \/Spa.\n\nAlso very pushy with trying to sale you products
