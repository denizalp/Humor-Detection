My spouse went here on a co-worker's recommendation and while the staff and office are pleasant, the actual dental work (filling) was not up to standard and continues to give problems in spite of two additional attempts by the Dentist to fix it. BTW, the actual work was done by Dr. Etman in this practice and not Dr. Brown who is the owner. The co-worker who originally recommended has also stopped going here after some bad experiences. Patients beware is all I can say.\n\nUpdate : Thanks for the offer Dr. Brown but I don't think my spouse wants to risk it again for the 4th time with your practice on a routine filling. One other thing, your office actually charged and got paid by our insurance company for the two additional attempts to fix the filling even though we were told it was \"no charge\" and being taken care of.
