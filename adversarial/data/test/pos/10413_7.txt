We came here for breakfast this morning, after dropping off our car for service.  \n\nWe were fully prepared to wait 20-30 minutes on a busy Saturday, but we must have timed it right.  We were seated in less than five minutes. The fact that it felt like Spring here in the Valley made it doubly nice\n\nEggs N' Joe actually proved to be fun, enjoyable and Tasty!~  And, the coffee will make your head snap back. Wowza!  A strong, but a not caffeine laden cup of Joe, unlike the green mermaid.\n\nA while back we were invited to an event sponsored by the ownership group, Elmer's Restaurants via email.  But in the end we couldn't make it since we were out of state.  It was a nice gesture. And after coming here today, we are sad we missed it!\n\nThe food at Eggs N' Joe is very good. The bacon was thick cut and had a nice smokey taste.  The eggs were made to order perfectly. The sausage links had a slight weisswurst taste. Everything was fresh and tasted like it was made to order. Nice!\n\nOut bill came to $25.96 before taxes and gratuities. Our Northwest Lumberjack coffee was $2.49 each. The Bacon Ranch was $9.49 and my Hungry Rancher, see photo was $11.49\n\nI only wished we lived nearby, so I could get some of their Lumberjack Joe each morning. \n\nEnjoy!
