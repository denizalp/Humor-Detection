Aside from a certain local business with a Korean-inspired name and a Strip location of a famous colorful LA institution, I wouldn't say that I have much experience with gourmet hot dogs. After tonight's visit, I'm starting to feel that I've been missing out.\n\nDog Haus is another sausage slinger imported from LA, one of at least 3 that come to mind. Had I not known about them before one of their LA locations was recently highlighted on a Travel Channel show, I would have probably gone anyway eventually. I can be a bit of a sucker for those places shown on TV though, and I ended up going sooner than I'd thought.\n\nThis Vegas outpost is in a certain very crowded Harmon\/Swenson\/Paradise-bordered plaza near the Strip, and I was fortunate not to go at anywhere near a peak hour. After carefully perusing the menu with my friend, we agreed to share some food so that we could enjoy a slightly more comprehensive introduction.\n\nOld Town Dog ($6.99, same as their other \"Haus Dogs\"): everything packed a big flavor punch here. The sweet Hawaiian rolls (three of which are pulled from a package and split down the middle) and the plump bacon-wrapped dog might've been enough alone, but the sweet and soft caramelized onions, the spicy pickled jalape√±os, the chipotle aioli, and the cotija cheese made it a party. It feels like a fairly \"safe\" flavor profile but isn't boring in the slightest, and I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nAnother Night In Bangkok ($7.99, same as their other \"Haus Sausages\"): also comes on Hawaiian rolls, but features a spiced Thai currywurst instead of a beef dog. I expected it to be spicier based on the concept and how they sold it on the TV show, but it was pleasantly mild. The peanut sauce sold me enough on the Thai concept, and the crunchy flavorful slaw really sealed the deal. I think it had less dimensions of flavor, but it lingered on the taste buds longer.\n\nFries ($2.99 a la carte, $3.49 with a combo): I was expecting them to be fluffier, but at least these thick-cut potato pieces had a crunch. There's a bit of an odd flavor from the oil, but the right amount of ketchup completely masks it and complements the fries overall. I no longer felt displeased to have to chew on the fries for one or two extra bites because the delay allows the combination of starch and vinegary sweetness to marry perfectly. Not a necessary side, but a very desirable one unless, heavens forbid, a ketchup shortage suddenly strikes.\n\nDog Haus seems to have found a winning tube meat formula with delicious ingredients through and through, and I'd be very happy to go back sooner rather than later as long as I don't run into parking issues in that jam-packed plaza. It's definitely the first hot dog restaurant on my local list for now.
