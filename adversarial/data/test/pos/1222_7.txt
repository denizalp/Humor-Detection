This is like the nightmare-behind-the-iron-curtain Loblaws. Depressing, dilapidated building. Panhandlers outside. Very very poor selection of groceries with a lot of low-quality stuff. Rotting, molding produce. Three consecutive members of the spaced-out staff had no idea what \"pancake mix\" was nor where I might find it. Finally a fourth person, possibly a manager, showed me, but unfortunately all the pancake mixes were trash versions, so after 10 minutes of searching I walked out with none. I won't be shopping here again.
