Another quality visit to Purple Elephant. Today, the family tried four cupcakes (Almond Oreo, Carmel Marble, Vanilla, and Strawberry Mango). As usual, the cakes were so moist and frosting as sweet and tasty as always. Staff is great and store very clean. Just a great little spot for a quick treat.  \n\nOn a side note, they have a huge selection of macaroons that I would love to try but I just can't swallow paying $2.50 a piece for such a small treat. Not that their price is high, as that does appear to be the going price. Just not sure why macaroons in general are so pricey. I will have to cave in though at some point because all their other treats are so good and will have to confirm the macaroons as well :p
