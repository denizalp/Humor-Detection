Been here three times now and I'm going to stop taking my dumb pills and stop going. First time was at CES 2013 and the second two times were at CES 2014. Never again.\n\nThe people are super nice and the service is exemplary. Decor is top notch. But I don't go to a steakhouse for service and decor. I go there for steak. Please go ahead and mistreat me but if you're going to charge me $85 for a ribeye it better be the best darn ribeye I've ever had. It needs to be at the level of J&G in Phoenix or Prime 112 in Miami for these kinds of prices. Probably even at the level of Peter Lugers (sp?) in NYC. Well it's not even close. Though I'll leave out good ol' Ruth's Chris since it's pretty hard to beat a steak that's drenched in sizzling butter. Both of the last two times I was at Prime, the ribeye was meh - gristle-y and a little on the chewy side. Totally not what I would expect from a $60-70 aged, prime ribeye. Had a piece of my neighbor's filet and it was a little better. Still rather flavorless to be honest. The sides are microscopic - they have no shame charging $14 for amounts to 4-5 Brussel sprouts. Definitely NOT sharable among 2-3 people as they say their sides are.\n\nGiven their level of service and the decor, it would just be wrong to give them a 1-star. But the food quality really just isn't there and I definitely will not go back.\n\nGoes to show that Pavlovian principles only apply to dogs. But no really, next CES, I am not subjecting anyone to Prime.
