Overpriced. I paid $39 for 2 glasses or wine, a drink and a whisky sour. I asked for a price list and the bartender said they didn't have one. I'm not a cheap person and I don't mind paying for good food or great drinks, but I like to know what im ordering and what to expect when my check comes. I also would like to know what type of wine they have. I like to read descriptions and recommendations. I found it odd there was no menu and I wasn't happy about paying $39 for a total of 3 drinks. Where do they think they are? Those are Los Angeles and New York prices. I feel ripped off! \n\nNever going back.
