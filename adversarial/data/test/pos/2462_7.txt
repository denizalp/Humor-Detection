Free is my favorite color!  Awesome service and totally deserves 5 Stars! If you are a group of girls going to Vegas then this service might not be as useful (based on my personal experiences that means pretty much every club will be free and no waiting in long lines) however if you are in mixed company (girls and guys) then this is awesome and a must. \n\nI used Free Vegas Club Passes a few weekends ago when my husband and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to Vegas. I signed up on Chris's website on Thursday and selected which clubs we wanted to go to. As mentioned on his website your options for the first night are limited, but there were more choices for the 2nd night. With in minutes of signing up I received a confirmation email with additional details of things happening the dates we would be there. Also, in the afternoon on our day of arrival I got a confirmation text from Chris. \n\nWe had originally signed up for LAX on our first night, but got a late start leaving LA and it didn't look like we would make it in by the midnight cut off time. I texted Chris around 10:30pm and he instantly put us on the guest lists for the palms clubs where his list worked till 2am. We showed up to Moon about 12:30am on a Friday night and only waited 5 mins to check into the guest list line. The only thing that slightly irritated me was the girl checking in us didn't automatically give me my 2 free drink tickets. I had to mention it and ask if I was one of the first 150 girls. I was and she gave them to me, but I had to sign up for the palms email list. Not a big deal and I'm glad I asked. The cover for guys was $10.\n\nThe second night I signed us up for Tryst. They pull the guest list from the general admission line and we weren't in line more than a few minutes before someone came by asking if we were on a list. We were pulled out of line and taken straight to the front where again I got two free drink tickets and my husband paid his $15 cover.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Overall I think reviews of night clubs aren't a good indication of whether or not you will like it do to do may factors like personal tastes, the various DJs and crowds, but here are my thoughts on the days we went.\n\nMoon: I had been here once before with a large group in October 2012 and had a great time. Not sure what was up this time, but the crowd was completely different and we got weird vibes. We only stayed about an hour before deciding we had enough and went gambling. I should mention the DJ was great and we enjoyed the music.\n\nTryst: We arrived just before midnight (very early by Vegas standards) and so at first the crowd seemed a bit off and we weren't liking the DJ. By 12:30 things totally turned around: the main DJ came on, tons of people showed up and we had a great time.\n\nOverall I highly recommend free Vegas Club Passes and Chris is my new go to promoter for mixed groups. He also has hook ups for day clubs, strip clubs and limos.
