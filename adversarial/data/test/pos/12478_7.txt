BEWARE!!! \n\nOasis is a nightmare: Before using this company please do the following things and then read my story.\n\nA. Better Business Bureau Website: Rating D+\nReview the company rating and complaints please.\n\nB. Google the company name: First site, \"Stay Away from Oasis\". There is an entire list of people who have been scamed by this company.\n\nC. Call Oasis customer service: 702-240-584. No one answers and you cannot leave a message because the box is full.\n\nD. They don't have a website or email listed.\n\nMy story:\n\n1. The company only take cash (except for 50% of the deposit). This is highly suspect. No major moving company takes cash. Cash makes it harder for the consumer to get their money back if they don't get what they paid for.\n\n2. They seriously under-quoted us. I was told that the price was quoted would easily cover my one bedroom apartment and when they arrived the price jumped $1000. Then when the items arrived the price jumped again for additional labor.\n\n3. It took them 3 1\/2 weeks to deliver my stuff.\n\n4. When my stuff arrived many items were damaged or lost: Mattress was soaking wet. Books were wet. Paintings were damaged. My clothes wet and covered in mold. Couch springs snapped off. Mirror missing and camera were missing.\n\n5. Other people's stuff: We have numerous items that are not even ours that were delivered to us. We can't even get through to the company to have them pick up the items.\n\n6. After loading all of our items, the movers told my girlfriend that they would take better care of her things if she turned over $150 in cash and that \"it would be a smart thing for her to do.\" She was worried and turned over the additional money.\n\nPros: They give low ball estimates that appears to be cheap\nCons: They damage property, lost other items and don't answer customer service calls.\n\nWe are filing a complaint with the business and will be following up with the BBB in Las Vegas as well reviewing our legal options.
