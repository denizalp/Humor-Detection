Didn't think that Trattoria could impress me more than it already did..but did they prove me wrong! Coming back several weeks later, I'm SO glad that their quality (in both service and food) remained high. \n\nConsistent great service, which is especially hard to find on Spring Mountain. Our server was very attentive of all her tables and was very quick and efficient with all our requests. But what differentiates the service here at Trattoria is that they continuously act in a manner that will delight and surprise their guests. We asked for lemons to squeeze into our water cups and to our surprise, she would bring a small plate of extra lemon slices every time we got a new glass of water. It's a small gesture but we were VERY impressed.\n\nWas able to try several different dishes this time around:\nItalian Spring Roll: Basically an antipasti plate in an egg roll. It tasted WAY better than it looked because I thought it was going to taste \"too fried\" but it wasn't! Plus, the cheese to prosciutto ratio was on point. \nFried Jidori Chicken: Upgraded popcorn chicken. The way this appetizer is described makes it seem like you only get a couple pieces of chicken but you actually get a pretty decent-sized bowl of salad with fried chicken, cherry tomatoes, and vinaigrette! \nSpaghetti Manila Clam & Asparagus: PERSONAL NEW FAVE. Thought nothing could surpass my love for the Linguini Clam & Shinso White Wine Sauce but the Garlic Anchovy Cream Sauce just hits the spot!\n\nOverall, a great if not the best fusion restaurant in my book! Highly recommended!!!!!!
