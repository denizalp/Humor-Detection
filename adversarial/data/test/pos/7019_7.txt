I enjoy staying here on Vegas visits. I've stayed at a handful of other hotels, and for the price you pay, it's not bad. I stay here when it's cheap. I won't pay more than $50 for a hotel there. Rooms come with a keurig, chick is great because it's the only Vegas hotel I've been to that has a coffee maker, that saves me easily $5 a day. \nThe rooms are clean, and simple. The beds are comfy. I like the seating area with a table and couch. Self parking is among the easiest compared to other hotels. \n\nI did too much day drinking last time and stayed in for the night while the man went out to play. I was too lazy\/sick to go get food for myself so opted for room service. $15 for a sandwich is ridiculous but it was so convenient I didn't even care. And it was tasty and cured me. \n\nThe pool is fun. Crowded. But I like floating around in the lazy river and hope people don't pee in it. They also have a jacuzzi. I don't think I've ever seen another hotel that has a jacuzzi. Something about liability with the mixture of booze and heat. But I'm glad they have one. \n\nThey have tons of restaurants and a food court which is very easy. The pub was a good place to hit up for happy hour. Nice priced well drinks and food. Neat decor. No complaints really.
