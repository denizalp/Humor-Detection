Finally a restaurant has opened that caters to people who oppose flavour and freshness - it is called veda. Stay away.\n\nIn terms of context, veda is kind of like the manchu-wok of Chinese food, the frankie tomoatoes of Italian food, and the taco bell of Mexican food...I hope you see where I'm going here.  Admittedly, there are people who like all of these places, including veda. That is nice for them. I am not one of those people.  \n\nFrozen Indian dinners from the supermarket and even canned Indian foods taste like gourmet treats compared to what is passed off as food at veda's.  Simply put, there is no lower rung on the totem pole of Indian food than this place.  To take it one step further, if one was in the unfortunate position of having to choose between eating Indian food from veda or eating the crap from someone who just ate quality Indian food somewhere else-  it would probably be a toss up, and I would not fault that person if they were to choose the latter.  This place is really bad.\n\nIf you want a good laugh, you could pair up with a friend and have one of you get take out from veda and the other from Indian Palace across the street (just make sure you are the one who ends up with the food from Indian Palace). Once the laughter (and tears from the person stuck with the \"food\" from veda) subsides, it will become readily apparent that to classify both of the dishes as \"Indian food\" is the insulting equivalent of calling both coffee and crack cocaine \"drugs\" - in other words two items that are worlds apart but unfortunately get stuck under the same overly broad category due to a lack of more precise terminology.  \n\nIf you were really feeling adventurous you and your friend could follow up the meal by having one of you drink a coffee from Starbucks, and the other taking a few hits off a crack pipe (at this point that person who ate the veda food will probably feel so sad and depressed they will eagerly hit the pipe in an effort to escape the memories of their awful meal).  Again, the gap between these two items will likely be readily apparent (but perhaps not even as extreme as the gap between the meals).\n\nAt the end of the day, the best advice here is to avoid veda  (and crack) at all costs.
