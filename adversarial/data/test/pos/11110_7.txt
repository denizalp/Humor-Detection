Meh. \n\nI've been to the Downtown location and this one. And for some reason, this one is just not as good. \n\nI will point out, the bartender was awesome. She was so nice and so helpful. She was quick to fill our drinks and to bring us our food. \n\nWe got there 1 hour and 15 minutes before closing. We ordered quickly and we didn't stay past closing. Before they closed, they started turning off lights. That to me is a sign to \"Hurry up and get the fuck out\". I get it and I work in customer service. But, I don't care if it's before closing time, you should never turn off the lights when you have clients in there. Even if they're in there past closing time. It's super rude and very unprofessional. Even the bartender apologized and said how rude it was. \n\nThe food was just \"ok\". I don't know, maybe they were having an off night or they were just pissed because we came in an hour before closing. We ordered a few things and everything seemed slapped together and just not very flavorful. \n\nI would love to give this place the benefit of the doubt because the one downtown is awesome. \n\nEither way, I'm not so sure I'll be coming back to this location.
