A trip to Vegas is never complete without a trip to Bouchon. It's my absolute favorite place to eat in Vegas (although they also have a location in Beverly Hills).\n\n+++ CHICKEN & WAFFLES - Served only during the weekends. Roasted chicken, bacon & chive waffle, Tahitian vanilla bean butter & Chasseur sauce. Expensive, but worth every single penny! It's understandably one of the more popular entrees at Bouchon and definitely a must-try for first-timers. It won't disappoint. The roasted chicken is packed with flavor and complimented by their wonderful Chasseur sauce (similar to a gravy, but 10x better and not as thick). The waffles are just as amazing as the chicken. The bacon and chives adds heartiness to the traditional waffle, but does not overpower it like I would have thought. Remember to add a little bit of their slightly sweet creamy butter onto the waffles for that additional wow factor.\n\n+++ GRAVLAX - Smoked salmon served with a petite baguette, spread of cream cheese & chives, red onion, tomato, and capers--my favorite dish for something light and refreshing that won't leave me bloated before heading out to a pool party\/day club. The salmon is smoked, but doesn't exude the pungent smokiness that some smoked salmon has. It's exceptionally delicious and although I omit the red onions, the combination of everything else still makes this a winner in my book.\n\n+ CROQUE MADAME - Grilled ham & cheese brioche sandwich with a fried sunny-side-up egg and Mornay sauce, served with French fries. The ham makes it slightly salty and the mixture of cheese, eggs, and Mornay sauce makes it rich and somewhat heavy. I highly suggest splitting this dish with someone else. The mound of French fries does slightly balance out the dish in respect to flavor, but not in calories. Beware that these thinly cut crispy French fries are quite addicting.\n\n+ + BERRY OATMEAL - My favorite oatmeal of all time. I was never a fan of oatmeal, but decided to go with this option after a gluttonous night of eating and drinking. It's served in cute little rustic pots with fresh strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and berry sauce. Add some cream, brown sugar, and voila! The perfect oatmeal with the perfect oatmeal to liquid ratio.\n\nThe restaurant itself is always busy during the weekends so expect a wait. It's usually loud during breakfast\/brunch, but tolerable. Occasionally, they'll have the patio open for diners which allows for a great view of the Venezia pool. Tables are a little bit closer to each other than usual, but the restaurant encompasses a casual and comforting feel that ultimately puts you at ease.\n\nTry it and you'll understand why a Vegas trip is never complete without having dined at Bouchon.
