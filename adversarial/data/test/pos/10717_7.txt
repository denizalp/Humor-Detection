About our 3rd time here after not really having any ideas where to go.  Bottom line,  should have kept looking for another spot.  We came in the front doors and as always this place has a modern neat vibe.  It appeared at first glance that most tables had just been sat.  we opted for 2 chairs at the bar.  Not ideal but was Ok.  A apparent hostess came up to us and asked if we wanted the bar or a table.  I thought that was pretty clear as we were pulling out chairs.  However, I did ask how long it would be for a table.  With that her response was \"I really have no idea\"  Really, my reply and asked how they can have no idea as to wait times.  She was rescued by a veteran who explained that it would be about a half hour.  We stuck with the bar.  YELP TIP.....Do not start reading bad reviews upon being seated.  My wife who has a sensitive but not sophisticated palette inquired about the white wine.  The bartender Katie knew very little about wine.  And yes I get that its a mexican joint.  Upon my wife asking to try the wine she was told no sampling as it was law.  She was correct its law.  However, the manager came over and explained how they had a liquor board violation and complaint.  My wife simply agreed and asked if she did not like the wine could she return it.  THe Tall bald manager referenced in other reviews rudley said.....\"If I think your going to return it im not going to sell it to you.  At $8 dollars a glass that a bit harsh.   Really?  Now I can not return a drink if its not liked?  WOW.  We opted for the Jamaican Mussels (again I know its mexican) \n Even proving to be more curious was how, when and why Curry is their secret mexican spice. They were pretty good with plenty of garlic.  However, I'm not sure they were $12 good. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos which were grilled and good sized.  However, very saucy and ratio of fish to cabbage was way off.  But I say again good sized.     I had the chicken Fajitas.  Pretty solid portion.  However, it appears that the chicken is portioned, pre cut and par cooked.  Again we encounter the secret spice, curry.  Really?  One of the yelp reviews complained that the food temp was a notch above taco bell.  I have to say this was spot on.  Both dishes were brought out luke warm.  Plates themselves were not even close to warm.  Someone needs to learn \"hot food Hot.  Cold Food Cold\"  The Fajitas also came with a dollop of quac.  Nothing special, and not sure its even made on site.  No diced tomatoes, Sour Cream or cheese.  Did I mention they cook with curry?  The best part of the dish was the habanero hot sauce.  This was not too hot and quite good.  Rice was plain white rice.  Come on guys.  Even Chipotle uses cilantro and lime.  I am shocked that they charge for chips and salsa.  Small bullet of salsa.  The fajitas as I said was a good portion.  So much so that I had enough left over for 1 more but the dish only came with 3 tortillas.  I asked the bartender for 1 more tortilla and was told that I would not be able to get just 1.  They are sold in 3's.  Really?  Im $15 into a dish that's not that good to begin with and $75 into the entire dinner.  Now I just cant get 1 more tortilla?  Shocked I plead my case that I just needed 1 more.  The Bartender told me I can just buy the 3 and through out the other 2.  Really.  So I just went old school and used the fork.  While doing so I had to ask \"Just exactly how much are 3 tortillas?  She said she was not exactly sure and thought they were $1.  Are we really fighting over $1 on a $75 check for 2 people?  Yes apparently we are.  The overall food quality and price is not in line and the poor customer service, which based on other Yelp reviews will be the demise of this place.  So long my Jamaican, Indian wanna be Mexican friends.  While you find your true Identity and nickle and time customers.  Ill be finding a new place to dine where  Im a valued guest and not an intrusion to your lack luster establishment.\nBye Mon, alavida, Goodbye!
