I went to Elliven Spa for the first time this week with a girlfriend for a pedicure. Upon walking into the spa, which is very neat and clean and smells wonderful, I was greeted by the hostess and offered a glass of sangria, chardonnay, chablis, etc. It was awesome! I went for the sangria which was delicious. We waited under five minutes and were shown to our chairs, picked out our nail color from the incredibly organized color wall, as well as picked out our scent for the bath salts (I went with mango coconut). Kate did my pedicure and she was AMAZING. If you are going to schedule, definitely request her. The staff was beyond friendly and accommodating. When we were running low on our sangria, another worker came over and filled up our glasses. It was such a fun girls night and we both made our next appointments before we left. I live about 45 minutes from here BUT I will drive that far once a month for a superior pedicure. I can't wait to try more of their services. We did also find out that they use all green products, organic, vegan, etc. which is right up my alley!
