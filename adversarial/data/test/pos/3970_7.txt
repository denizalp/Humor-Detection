Still one of our favorite movie theaters in Charlotte. The seats are wide, leather, and recline slightly and each theater is not so cavernous that you're too far away from the screen in any seat. I like when it's busy and watching the people race up the two flights of stairs to beat the people that have taken the escalator to the box office. The giant windows allow you to see Uptown in the distance and Ballantyne at your feet. The popcorn is fresh, the people are nice and if they ever start serving White Street Beer then they will even get a sixth star.
