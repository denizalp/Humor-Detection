A clean and tasty  family owned Chinese restaurant? It is possible out there! I love Asian mom and pop places but I could never really share that with my Caucasian associates because of the cleanliness. To them, a good Chinese restaurant is PF Chang! Why? Because they put sweet and sour sauce on fried things and keep the dining area CLEAN. Why is PF Chang always so busy despite  the mediocre food? Because there are people like me who feel embarrassed to take business associates to locations like KJ Kitchen, Bosa 1, Pho So 1, Cathay House, or Orchid Garden etc. \n\nSo the pluses of Wendy's:\n1. Cleanliness\n2. Wonton noodle soup and roast duck. The skin of the duck remained crispy in the broth when it was served. AMAZING!\n3. Fluffy fried rice \n4. Service. We had two waitresses tending to our every needs. The owner Wendy came out to greet us and share her knowledge of the next best thing.\n5. DESERT. Shaved ice the size of my face with a fantastic selection of toppings. Grass Jelly, Red Bean, and fresh Taro chunks. ($1.99 special)\n\nNext visit : save room for desert!
