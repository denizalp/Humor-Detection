Binion's a place for lovers? \n\nYup it's true. Binion's that hard scrabble gambling hall downtown, is maybe the most romantic spot in Vegas. At least for me. \n\nI asked my wife to marry me at the Bellagio Fountains, we got married at Caesars, but Binion's is the spot that does it for me. \n\nWe were sitting at the Binion's Snack Bar. Which we love almost as much as we love the Coffee Shop downstairs.  Anyways, we were sitting there enjoying a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, when a very elderly lady asked me if she could sit down at the counter next to me. \n\n\"Of course,\" I said, and moved my food over a little. Then she turned and helped her even more elderly husband to the chair.  Everyone knew the couple, they all asked how he was doing. He obviously was not doing too well. But he said something to the effect of, \"I'd complain, but who would listen!\"\n\nThe couple sat down and ordered two bowls of the snack bar's famous Hobo Stew. Here is a link to a pdf of the menu of the snackbar. \nhttp:\/\/www.binions.com\/dining\/snackbarmenu.pdf\n\nThey talked to the cooks about their kids, about the cooks' kids, about life in general.  After they were finished, the lady helped him to his scooter and one of the cooks called out, \"See ya next week.\" The gentleman responded, \"I'm not making any guarantees but I sure hope so.\" \n\nWell turns out this couple had been coming to binions, every week for over 40 years. Sitting at this same counter, ordering that same hobo stew.  As we watched them go away, my wife said, \"Think that will be us someday?\" \n\nI said, \"if we are really really lucky honey, it will be.\"
