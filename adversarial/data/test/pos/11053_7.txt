This review is only for the optical side (where they make your glasses). I had an excellent experience at the optometrists side of the business (where you get your eye exam), so that part was definitely 4 stars. \n\n-- Meanwhile --\n\nDo yourself a favor - go somewhere else where they know more about how to make glasses!\n\nAmy (one of the optical people) was incredibly rude to us during the entire visit. We walked in and she barked as us, \"I'll be with you when I can\". We were there to pick up 2 pairs of glasses for myself. I have a very strong prescription, and have been wearing glasses at this strong prescription for over 15 years. Never, and I really mean never have I ever received such horrible glasses than those I received this time at VisionWorks. This is my first pair from VisionWorks. The frames I chose were slightly larger than my old pair of glasses. When I ordered the glasses, Christy did not have any idea which lenses to recommend to me considering my high prescription. I ended up getting the polycarbonate lenses (as opposed to the high index ones). When the glasses came in a week later, the prescription of the left lens of one pair was wrong, and Amy was very annoyed and treated me like dirt the entire time, saying things such as \"Are you SURE you can't see out of it?\" She resolved to order me another left lens for that pair, since her minor adjustments didn't seem to solve the problem. Meanwhile, the lenses of both sets of glasses I ordered came out incredibly thick (truly \"coke-bottle\" glasses), and it was so embarrassing - I literally could never wear those out of the house. If someone had told me they would look that bad, I would have picked different frames. Amy said, \"Well, you know when you get a larger frame, the edges will be thicker, I mean your prescription is REALLY strong\" (again in a nasty tone). As I mentioned before, I have NEVER had an issue with lenses or frames at any other place where I have ordered glasses. The glasses were so awful, and the service was just as bad. I will absolutely never be going back to VisionWorks considering what terrible knowledge the employees have of their products, and just how poorly they treat their customers.
