I had to try it!! Of course I do, it's hot and new!  I went on a Sunday for brunch and it was slow at first and then got busy as the day went on.  The server was really out of it.  She was completely confused and the whole greeting\/ordering was not ideal.  Really no conversation, not asking if we'd been before, no explaining of the menu or specials.  That was disappointing. \n\nThe appetizers: (edamame & spring rolls) and sushi (honey) were good. The spring rolls had a great peanut dipping sauce.  The drunken noodles, I ordered a special way, omitting some items and the waitress literally came back three times to ask me what the order was again. After writing it down the first time.  Well, third times a charm, because it came out tasty!  I got 4 spicy, but could've done 5.   Mango sticky rice was delicious.\n\nFood was very good. Environment was nice...beautiful inside and a patio outside.  Service, not what I would've expected.  Maybe a bad day.
