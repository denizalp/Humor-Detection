Pita Pit is hands down the best final stop on any downtown Charlotte drinking tour.\n\nThe line is long, but the staff is very experienced at keeping it moving.  Also, you will seldom find a more drunkenly amiable line to stand in.  I made more friends in the Pita Pit line than I made at the last Yelp event.\n\nThe food is...well...to tell you the truth I can never remember.  However, judging by the clothes I wore the night before, it can be a bit messy.\n\nDefinitely go here before passing out on your next night of revelry, your hangover will thank you.
