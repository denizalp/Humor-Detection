We were going out of town for a few days and needed someone to check in on our cat. High 5 pet care was recommended through our apartment complex so we decided to give him a call. \nWe were very impressed upon the first \"meet and greet\" and our cat took to him right away. Throughout our trip he sent us picture updates every time he visited which was very nice. Plus he cleaned the litter box every visit. \nWe will continue to use high 5 pet care every time we need to find a pet sitter
