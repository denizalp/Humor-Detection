Ah....June.  Happy Birthday to me!  I started to get all my \"free birthday emails\" last week, and decided to use one of them today at Rubios.  Sign up for their E-Club, and the week before\/after your birthday, you get a free entree with purchase of a drink.  Score!  \n\nDrove down, went inside, showed my coupon on my phone, purchased my drink for about $3.00, and was all set.  I decided to go with the Shrimp and Bacon Burrito with no chipotle sauce.  I got my number, my drink, and took a seat outside (decent sized seating area inside, but like everything near Arrowhead, PACKED...always!).  The lady brought out my plate with my burrito and some chips on it.  Here is how it was...............\n\nShrimp and Bacon Burrito-  Doesn't that just sound delicious?  Shrimp and bacon?  Hell to the yes!   This burrito was packed with flavor!  It had shrimp, bacon, guacamole, jalapenos, rice, cheese and salsa in it!  It was delicious!  There were probably 10 shrimp in it!  The flavors meshed very well, and the jalapenos gave it some sneaky heat!  The cheese was like a fried cheese crisp almost.  Great texture, and good flavor!  Fresh guacamole, perfectly cooked rice and and overall, it was pretty fat!  I don't know if I would pay the regular price for it ($8.99), but for free??  Shit yes!  This burrito was delicious!\n\nOverall, I was stoked that Rubios hooks it up for your birthday!  Very kind of them, and I appreciated it.  The burrito was delicious, service was friendly, and it only cost me less than $3.00. Score!  I would definitely come back to this Rubios for another burrito and\/or their fish tacos!
