I has horrifically embarrassed by the hostess who, I'm not even joking- made a COMMENT ON MY OUTFIT. It was my first time here with my husband, and I had never been before. I didn't know what to wear, and had on some Toms shoes. She asked if either one of us had been there, and upon my reply of \"No,\" she responded ,\"that would explain the Toms.\"\nI'm not even kidding. \nIs this not Vegas? I was mortified! Who does that?!?! Good food or not, I felt like I was bullied by an 18 year old. \nIt was a while ago, but we've never been back.
