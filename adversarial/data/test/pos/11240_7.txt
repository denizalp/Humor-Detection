I find it quite amusing that immediately after I posted my awful experience at Enterprise rent a car on Craig road. Enterprise responded to my posting. We'll they didn't really respond to me they responded to my posting asking for my personal information so someone in there cooperate office could discuss my experience with me. I did as they requested and no one ever reached out. Which tells me they were embarrassed by my posting but not enough to change anything. Just enough to respond to yelp so others reading the posting would think they responded. Nice job enterprise!!! I think you should change your slogan to \" customer service doesn't matter if you don't like it go somewhere else\" The only problem with that is we have other choices, other companies that really care and want our business!\nSo shame on you Enterprise! Shame on your pratices! Shame on your lack of customer service! Shame on you for not caring enough to change your ways!!!
