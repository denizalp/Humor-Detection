Great chicken curry patties.  Unfortunately, it looks like they're off the menu- all I see are spinach and tilapia patties.  Coco bread was buttery,-pretty tasty!- and I loved its texture, and it, too, looks like it's off the menu.  $2.50 for a side of steamed veggies was a joke!  I kid you not, I saw one cabbage leaf, one very thin slice of tomato, and one  ultra-thin-sliced ring of red bell pepper.  (Honestly, I didn't think it was possible to slice something that thin... ah, one word: mandolin.)  All served on a teacup plate.  I felt so ripped off  :(\n\nRestroom was clean, and so was the rest of the restaurant.
