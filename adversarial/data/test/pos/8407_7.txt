Ella's Deli, an iconic restaurant here in Madison. I've been visiting this particular location on and off over the last 20 years or so. More so when our kids were younger, and when we lived just a few blocks away. The carousel of course has always been the main attraction and highlight. Even now, when it's open for the season, I, and my now teen\/s still take advantage of a little ride once around. Now, about the inside atmosphere and food: yes, I won't deny it's a bit \"gritty\" so to speak. Sure, it could use some updating, but there's something nostalgic and kitschy about the original flooring, tables, counter tops. There's a lot of hoopla, movement, color, and mechanical paper mache characters moving above your head, that always seem to mesmerize youngsters, and a few elders I know as well. The food is, for the most part very good. It's one of these places I tend to order the same old, same old, because I'm never disappointed. I always loved the open face platters of turkey and gravy over mashed potatoes. The open face corned beef reuben on rye is always amazing and so is the sweet and sour cabbage soup. Mmmmmm.... love it. Fries are always yummy from my experience and the blue cheese burger is also good. I veered off my normal path recently and ordered the blueberry and blue cheese salad with walnuts. Loved it! The owners are very sweet people and take a lot of pride in their restaurant. I highly recommend stopping by when the weather is nice and the carousel is up and running. they keep the carousel and horses maintained and freshly painted often. I think they are doing right by keeping Ellas Deli up and running traditionally as most folks that come in, expect it to be as they remember it, and revel and reminisce in all that they always loved.
