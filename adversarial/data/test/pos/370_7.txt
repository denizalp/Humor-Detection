Smells like tea spirit - Teavana.\n\nWe came here and actually bought some tea for my girl who lives on the Eastside of Cleveland and doesn't get to go mall shopping very often.\n\nTeavana is a fun place full of all kinds of fancy teas. They're usually in the loose leaf version, but you can get the tools hereto make it at home. The employees are very helpful, and you can get some samples of seasonal teas. Expensive, though.
