I have been going to this restaurant for years, all 3 locations. That being said, I am done with them.\nLast week I took two people with me and got there for Happy Hour. During the noshing on peel and eat shrimp we started talking to the bartender about the food. When I said it was so uneven on quality and preparation during different visits he asked if they were busy during my \"bad\" dining experiences. I said half and half, he told me that when they are busy the experience suffers. I asked him if the price was also reduced due to quality issues. He laughed, I was not joking, so...\n85 dollars later, I left Happy Hour vowing never to return....
