Getting all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed at once is no fun for anyone, but Dr. Chiem helped make it as great of an experience as possible.  I went for local anesthesia and was really nervous b\/c I've never had any dental or surgical procedure done on me before, but everything went great!  I didn't feel a thing while he was working on the removal.  It didn't take too long and the painkillers afterwards really helped.  I'm happy with the staff, professionalism, and cleanliness of the place - a lot of my friends have had infections after their removals or other procedures, and I'm glad to say everything went very smoothly for me w\/ Stars Dental!
