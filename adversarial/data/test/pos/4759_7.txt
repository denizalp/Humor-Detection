This place has it all!\n\nIncompetent Hosts: Check\nUntrained Bartenders: Check\nOver pretentious kitchen staff:  Check\nClueless Waitstaff: Check\n\nHaving lived on the lake for 19 years and going to dinner by boat 1-2 nights a week we feel like we know every spot on the lake.   We have heard so many bad things about Hello Sailor that we have avoided it.  Over the weekend we heard some glowing reviews so we decided to give it a try, figuring they have all the kinks worked out.  Since they have been open for 6 months.   Unfortunately, we were sadly mistaken.\n\nWe arrived on a Tuesday night by boat around 6:15pm.  We were surprised to see only 1 boat using the boat slips.  Previously when you would go to the Rusty Rudder, you would expect to wait on a boat slip on any night.\n\nWe walked up the newly remodeled deck and saw a number of empty tables.  The deck and the inside of the restaurant look fantastic.  They have done a marvelous job with the remodel.  We went to the front and noticed a large line of people waiting to be seated.   The entire inside of the restaurant was empty and only about half of the tables outside were full, yet there was a wait for a table.  We decided to go to the bar and have a drink.   There were 8 people at the bar, our party of 7 almost doubled the number of people at the bar.  We ordered 4 beers and 2 mixed drinks.   The frazzled bartended told us we needed to wait a minute, and 5 minutes later he came back and asked us what we wanted.   He fixed the beers, but was unable to make the drinks, and another bartender made them.  (they were very complicated Gin and Tonic).  We were halfway through our beers when the mixed drinks were made and shortly our table was ready.  Surprising, the table was in view of the bar and was empty the entire time we were there.   They either wanted us to go to the bar or the host was Incompetent.   I assume the latter, because in no way would they want to show off the lack of bartending skills.\n\nBy the time we sat down, we all were ready for another drink.  The waiter comes by and asks if we want water, and we tell him that we are ready for a drink, he tells us that he has to get us water first before he can get us a drink.   We all wait while this goes on, we make our drink orders and wait about 15-20 minutes for our drinks.  We ordered Hush Puppies for $3.99.   We are told that for 7 people we would need to get 2 orders that only 5 come to an order.  For those doing the math, that is $.80 per hushpuppy!  They were good, but not that good.\n\nNow it is time to order.   My wife orders the crispy chicken sandwich, and asks if she could add cheese to it.  The waiter informs her that unfortunately she cannot.   He stated, they purchase local foods and match them exactly with the portions and that cheese does not come on that sandwich so she cannot have cheese on her sandwich.   Our friend orders a burger and does not want cheese her burger and asks if she can put her cheese on my wife's sandwich.  We are informed that that is not possible, but she could have her cheese on the side, and when it comes to the table she could give then give her the slice of cheese.   When the food arrives, we place another order for a round of drinks, this take about 20 minutes.  The drinks arrive just as we finish eating.  The waiter apologizes for how slow the bar service is, and says it is because they are slammed.  We look around at the half empty tables and I ask him what are they going to do on a Saturday or busy holiday weekend.   He said they will be staffed up by then.\n\nThe food was mediocre.   For being as pretentious as they are, North Harbor has much better food and better trained staff.  If you want a fun atmosphere live music, Blue Parrot and Apps and Taps is well worth the 30-40 minute boat ride over this place.   We really wanted this place to be great, as we need more places on the lake to go to by boat.   Unfortunately, this will not fill the void and will drive more people to the good places on the lake.\n\nRead the reviews on the site.  It is all from people from Charlotte or out of town that are amazed by the view.  They are happy to have overpriced crappy food, with horrible service as long as they have a view.   Please, send all the out of towners and Charlotte people here.  Leave all the other places on the Lake for the locals.
