Pretentious place except the location and the wall art by Tato Caraveo. Mediocre \"high end\" Mexican food at ridiculous prices. Not sure why the hype around that chef. Same thing with the original barrio long ago at Thomas and 16th. I get the idea behind mixing elements from central, south Mexico, Oaxaca and DFederal, but cmon 4 tiny finger sized seafood flautas covered in heavy creamy sauce for 24$?! Funny all my well traveled Mexican friends are referring to all Barrios locations as \"comida por gringos\"
