I wandered in about 10 days ago..didnt have time to shop but they appear to have a very large collection of products. Only thing that makes me hesitate is all the previous reviews about their customer service. Perhaps I will try a smaller purchase to test them out before the large ones. But,there is no shortage of choices here for all types of looks...will follow up if and when i decide to pull the trigger.
