Who are you? Who, who? Who, who?\n\nSorry! Couldn't resist the Who reference just oozing with cheesiness...\n\nWhat lies inside the big red brick architectural wonder with the giant question mark? The Riddler's hideout? Unknown Brewing of course. A cool cave of a brewery with nooks and crannies of seating areas and a mini arcade. At back is the gigantic bay where all the magic happens.\n\nThe draught menu is projected above the bar. If you live in or near Charlotte you've probably already tasted some of their greatest hits like Head First Northwest Ale, No Shame Wheat and Silverback Stout. My personal favorites are Over the Edge IPA and Scratch N Sniff IPA. Over the Edge gets West Coast hops put in 7 times during production! These guys also take some chances, as reflected in their \"Now or Never\" category. The Tropical IPA (tasted like coconuts and bananas) and Hospitali-T, while not my favorites were still quite tasty. When available, Teleporter is killer!\n\nGreat place to hang out with friend and taste some great beer!!!
