Have you ever walked away from a pedi with a fungus? \n\nWell, guess what, you will never get a yucky foot disease here, do you know why? Because, for $5 you can purchase a kit which consists of a box and your own exclusive nail tools! After your mani or pedi then your tools are sterilized and stored on the premises for you until your next visit. Pretty awesome, eh?\n\nPhamtastic also offers eyelash extensions, permanent make-up, waxing, facials and couples pedicures. (There's two chairs set in a private room.)
