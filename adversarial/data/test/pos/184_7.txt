Why go to the movies when you can watch almost anything from the comfort of your own home or mobile device?\n\nWell, this NEW Harkins will help you love the experience of going to the movie cinema again! No nasty dirty movie theater seats here or sitting near inconsiderate patrons who put their shoes all over the seats near you or repeatedly bump your seat. The assigned seats are leather recliners and the aisles are so wide, you don't bump into anyone! \n\nSince it's so new, it's very clean! Staff were very friendly too!\n\nThe Cine 1 is a mega large screen, kind of like the old Cine Capri that once stood on corner of Camelback and 24th Street (if you grew up here, you remember seeing Star Wars and other fantastic flicks there! Sigh!). All of the other theaters at this new Harkins are standard theater size, but still great!\n\nThe movie prices are a little higher here, but you are paying for the overall movie experience. I LOVE it! I even saw an action movie here and I don't even like action movies! I can't wait to see another movie here! FIVE stars!!!
