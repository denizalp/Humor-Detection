Local, local, local. Great little bar with good food and cold brews. It's a small place but with lots of character. I've been here a few times for lunch. The Reuben is fantastic, so are their hot dogs. Haven't tried the burgers yet. Friendly place with lots of local regulars located on Park Rd in the Dilworth area. It's worth a stop.
