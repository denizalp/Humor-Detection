This is one of those rare occasions where I must say that the 4\/5 stars that I giving in this review is truly based off strictly the atmosphere and one food item on their menu, but that one food item is so extraordinary that it by itself could garner a 5\/5 for this entire venue. \n\nI have dined at the Park on Fremont twice. Once at night and once when they first opened at 11am. On both visits, I ordered different entrees and one standing appetizer: Garbage Fries. The Garbage Fries are amongst the best loaded fries that I have ever experienced. The mixture of two different cheeses, onions, fried egg, and seasonings make these fries simply decadent and an delicious indulgence that I have not found a comparable equivalent anywhere. They are a MUST ORDER item that alone make the Park on Fremont a required visit, even if you detest hipsters. \n\nThe atmosphere is another plus. Though it certainly is designed and geared toward the hipster crowd, no question, it still provides a wonderful location right on Fremont with a great park-like patio that wraps around the restaurant. The rear patio even has a teeter totter for those wanting to feel young again. The people watching is phenomenal though you should be prepared to get stared at right back. The beggars are only a few feet away so that does detract a bit but nonetheless, it is still a great spot outside. The interior is hipster and whimsical with Trivial Pursuit cards on every table for entertainment and weird art on the walls. Overall, it is a great all around atmosphere. \n\nNow the negatives:\n\n1. Though the garbage fries are incredible, I have not found any of the other appetizers or entrees to be that spectacular. The beef tacos are great but not a great value. The chicken and waffle sandwich is a bit bland and the sweet potato tots are usually lukewarm and an acquired taste at best. \n\n2. They do not allow kids to dine there after 6pm and prior to 6pm, they can only dine on the patio. \n\n3. Parking. Though there is a parking lot right adjacent to the restaurant, it is a paid parking lot that is privately owned. Your best best is to park at a casino and walk over. \n\n4. Though I personally do not find this to be a detractor, many will: this is truly Hipster central.  \n\nOverall, I like the Park on Fremont. Great location, atmosphere and signature fries that are quite possibly, the best in Las Vegas.
