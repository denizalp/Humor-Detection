This was among the best meals I have ever had. When choosing a location for our anniversary dinner, I went back and forth and eventually we settled on this lovely steakhouse located in New York, New York. Once we made a reservation online, it was smooth sailing from there! The atmosphere was great! Really reminded me of being in a classic New York eatery. \n\nFor starters, we started with Lobster Bisque, which was very flavorful. This set the tone for the rest of the meal. For sides, we ordered the creamed spinach, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes... and they were all admirably, if not spectacularly, done. The dry aged cuts were simply breathtaking. I've enjoyed many over the course of my life, but these were cooked to perfection. Can't say enough about these steaks! The meal was definitely the highlight, but the service was impeccable! Kudos to the wait staff for making it an excellent dining experience!\n\nGallagher's is actually quite affordable for a steakhouse (all of your classic cuts of steak will range somewhere between $40-$80, the appetizers hover around $15, and the sides just barely stay in single digits), but I'd recommend it without hesitation if you appreciate a fantastic steak!
