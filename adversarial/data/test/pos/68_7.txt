Most of our hiking group got together on Friday for breakfast and Sun City Caf√© was recommended by one of our group who had been here and they knew they could handle a group our size (11 or 13 this time--I didn't take roll).\n\nThe server was good enough to ask if we wanted separate checks and he did that for each and every one of us--above and beyond!  \n\nI ordered the special of the day which was a Tex\/Mex kind of omelette made with pulled pork and topped with salsa verde and some tortilla strips.  You had a choice of hash browns or breakfast potatoes with onions and peppers.  I went with the breakfast potatoes.  Some in the group subbed fresh fruit for potato and toast.  I had rye toast.\n\nThe omelette was OK.  Even though the kitchen was busy with our orders and the other customers, the wait was not long.  It wouldn't have mattered as we were engaged in good conversation and much kidding.  \n\nThe restaurant is a very pleasant place and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.  There were some pancakes on the menu that sounded great!
