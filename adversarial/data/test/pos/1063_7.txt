My brother was in town from military service with his wife and we just want to have fun. So we out went out as a family. All five of us played laser tag and the escape room. The price wasn't bad at all and we had so much fun. I won the laser tag game I had to show my younger brothers and husband I play no games hahaha We won the escape room too. They have another room that's harder we might do it soon.
