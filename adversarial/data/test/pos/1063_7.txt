Maybe this is too little, too late. Word on the street has it that these guys are closing their doors as of today. Bummer - they had pretty decent food and a great beer selection. These are the same owner's who took over Newt's in Shelby, NC awhile back.\n\nNot sure of the exact circumstances, but they opened up Howler's to give it another go in the Craft Burger\/Craft Beer arena. The new space is much better and more spacious. The prices are fair although maybe locals aren't ready for a $9-$10 burger. The restaurant industry is pretty well saturated in Gastonia and I've seen some awesome places have to shutter their doors.\n\nLast time in I had a really nice burger with deep fried jalapenos - was the burger of the day which is only $6 with a side. And of course Bengali IPA is one of my faves.\n\nIf what I heard is true, they will be missed - if not, check out their burger of the day!!
