I used to LOVE coming to this restaurant about 10 years ago, but their management changed multiple times over the past 7 years and each change has made the restaurant one step worse. This recent time had me not wanting to return anymore.\n\nFood wise, it was alright. We ordered the medium platter of sashimi, a stone-pot bibimbap, and donburi. The taste and portion were average, but they have raised $1 more on each item since the last time I went. However, they were ridiculously STINGY in their Banchan. I understand that people take advantage of the banchan and kept asking for refills since it is free of charge, but on the first go, 5 pieces of those spicy fish slices and a spoonful of beansprouts just do not cut it. When we asked for refills, they gave us even less. I brushed it off since it was \"free\". \n\nThe service was what I had problems with. I was half way through the bibimbap and was taking a break from eating, with my utensils down and talking with my family when one of the waiters came over and asked whether I was finished with my meal. I was surprised she asked because it was obvious that I was not. It was 9pm at that time and I thought maybe they had wanted us out since the restaurant might be closing. In fact I saw all their waiters cleaning up already at that time. So I brushed it off. \n\nWhenever we finished one dish, whether small or big, they would ask to take it immediately. It is great if you feel like the dishes are in the customers' way, but I felt SUPER RUSHED as if they wanted us out. We asked for more green tea, and they didn't want to give it to us. We quickly finished our meal and they immediately gave us the ice cream and the bill. At this time, it was 9:20pm. Literally 2 minutes later, the waitress came over with the credit machine and made us pay. WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE CHANCE TO GO OVER THE BILL. I immediately got angry and asked the waitress what time they closed and she said 10:30pm!! So I asked her, \"are you guys in a rush?\" It seems like you're all rushing us out!! She was shocked that I asked her and said that they are not in a rush. The credit card machine also had a lot of problems!!!  \n\nSorry, I don't take rude service. I'm not coming back.
