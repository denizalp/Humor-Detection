This place is basically a low rent TCBY. Its good for what it is. The place is small and was pretty filthy when we went. It gets crowded really easily.  They do not have a great selection on toppings and every time I have gone my cup has been handed to me messy and dripping. It seems like they can not keep the toppings in the cup. As taste goes, it is fine. Nothing special. I would go back but there are so many other places I would go before Golden Spoon.
