Dr. Stevenson is the only Veterinarian I trust to take care of my furbabies. I've had other vets here and they don't have nearly the personal care that Dr. Stevenson extends to our pets, who are family to us.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable for the amount of knowledge you are receiving. Trust us, we've been to UW Veterinary Clinic countless of times, who boasts Board Certified Vets, and feel Dr. Stevenson has the equal amount of expertise, if not more due to the fact that he has awesome bedside manners.\n\nWe've been to other vet clinics before coming here only to have to answer the same questions about the background of our dogs, their ailments repeatedly. Feeling like another number to most, Dr. Stevenson is the exception. He's sharp and remembers every treatment, procedure, and medication your pet has been on. \n\nDr. Stevenson is also very honest. They do a lot of procedures and are able to run numerous tests in house. If they don't have the technology or expertise in something, he will recommend you to the right place.\n\nThank you Dr. Stevenson and staff for everything!
