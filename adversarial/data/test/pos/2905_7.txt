I finally got a chance to go here,in fact i went twice in a week. The food is well prepared,you can tell they put high quality ingredients and love into their creations. I tried the falafel the first time and the second time was a ground beef and cheese sandwich. They were both very good. And Will who is the order taker is very cool. You can tell he enjoys serving great food and he is excited to make sure you are completely satisfied. Whoever owns this place needs to make sure they do whatever they need to do to keep this guy he is a major reason i returned the second time. Ok now to the 1 star deduction,the neighborhood sucks and there is no where to eat the food but on the trunk of my car. i could sit in a chair but i dont want crumbs all over me. I was half expecting to get shived at any moment,but hey what a way to go with a delicious falafel sandwhich in my mouth,right? lol..seriously i was half expecting to see dogs raping hookers in the alley...anyways besides the surroundings it was an excellent sandwich...good toast too :)
