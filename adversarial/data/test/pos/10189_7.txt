As first-gen German, when I heard there was a Berlin-style Doner shop opening in Toronto, I knew I had to get there stat, so I was pumped to finally get to try it last night.\n\nI tried the Halloumi Teller (i.e. plate), the Donair Teller and the Chicken Doner sandwich between friends. All were amazing. The fries were perfect, the halloumi to die for, and the meat perfectly spiced. The Teller is HUGE, so come hungry. The sandwiches come with more vegetables so they are a healthier choice. Didn't try to the Currywurst so will have to come back for that.\n\nGreat vibe, friendly service and a bonus bathroom secret that I don't want to spoil for you if you haven't been.
