Yay, celebrities love new american cuisine as much as we do! Forget about the ridiculosity of the investors (Nick Lachey & Nicky Hilton & Wilmer Valderrama!) - the food here is actually excellent.  It's super trendy & you will be surrounded by people who think The Hills is a documentary but you will feel better after you have some complimentary warm pretzels, a few bottles of Vosse water, some freshly fried felafel, a fancied up Big Mac & some chicken and waffles. \n\n5 stars is probably a little too much, but it was a pleasant surprise and you get to go into LAX for free, which is still paying too much, but it's very easy to make a night out of coming here, which I can appreciate.
