808 tapas is wonderful. Nice simple interior....tons of options to choose from on the menu with simple descriptions. \n\nI came here for lunch with some friends starving and left happy as can be...\nStaff is great...I love Hawaiian hospitality. So friendly and bubbly. \n\nI got the following... \n\nSpicy tuna cracker \nChef suggestion...I was craving a spicy tuna with crispy rice but they didn't have that...\nAmazing. So delicious. Spicy tuna on top of a fried seaweed wasabi flavored cracker.  Probably my favorite from the entire meal.\n** liked it so much I ordered 2 :P \n\nYellowtail sashimi \nButtery.  Fresh. \nThumbs up\n\n808 ceviche \nSweeter than your average ceviche because of the mango. Served with taro chips.  Not my favorite but not bad.  I just love ceviche and this wasn't what I expected.  \n\nAdegeshi tofu \nLightly fried with Japanese mushrooms and a nice teriyaki sauce. Very good. \n\nBeef tataki\nServed with garlic ponzu. Thumbs up.  Yum. \n\nYellowtail jalapeño \nServed with a yuzu cilantro sauce with cucumber and a piece of jalapeño. Obviously I'm a fan of their yellowtail. *-*\n\nChicken katsu \nVery nicely done. Thumbs up.  \n\nButa hara sautee \nPork belly and asparagus sauteed in a garlic soy sauce.  The pork belly was cut up in cubes, personally a bit to salty for me but my friend loved it.  \n\nId come here more often of it was closer to where I live...but if ever in the area Id definitely stop in.  Try them out *-*
