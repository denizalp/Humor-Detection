So I had been wanting to try this place. But, I have always been in such a hurry when I am at the airport I had not had time. The plus side is ,it is inside security so you don't have to worry about getting through Security. Which can always be stressful.\nIt is a very popular place as it is on the low B gates and there is a lot of flights out of that side in the morning. I came here with a friend from Denver after coming in from a flight. So we were not rushed. It is a very clean looking place. A great menu to choose from as well.\n\nI ordered the Steak and Eggs, just a note, they do not do poached. So I got scrambled. It was very good and the steak was cooked just the way I like it. My friend got potatoes ,eggs , and bacon. The food was delicious and cooked just right. It was hot when it came out and it came out fast. The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars instead of 5. Was our server. She never brought us more coffee. \nSeriously we had to ask 2 other servers for more coffee. Which they brought us and with a smile.  Our server Alexa( I think that was her name). Did not seem too happy to be there and did not want us to have more than one cup of coffee. \nThe bright side is, Food is great, place is clean, and most all the other servers are awesome.
