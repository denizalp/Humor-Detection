Shane C., the owner of this little, grossly overpriced tattoo parlor, has contacted me with VERY rude comments and is threatening to try to have my Yelp account canceled for being honest about my experience in his shop. He wrote, \"We don't give a shit, how bout that for customer service! So just like this Yelp message you are in the way holding up the line with your bullshit. Next time you hear from us it will be from Yelp canceling your account!!!\" \n\nClearly Shane is in need of anger management counseling. Get help, Shane, get help.
