Is this Cleveland right now? But really- I thought CLE was all about beer and polish food. Not today my friends! \n\nIf you're looking for an experience, look no further than Li Wah on a Sunday for some tasty, Asian vittles. Dim sum FTW. Chicken feet? Got that. Taro patty? Got that. Peking duck bun? Got that too. \n\nThe price is right. The food is pretty ok. Some dishes were super tasty, like the sticky rice and meat wrapped in a banana leaf, while other dishes were just alright, like the roasted duck. Quick service. Free hot tea. Cool ambiance. \n\nAll in all, I feel like this Cleveland brunch spot is a staple and should not be overlooked.  I'll be back, Li Wah, and next time, I'm going to bring my friend who speaks Chinese so the cart ladies can answer all my questions  (\"what's in that bun?\")
