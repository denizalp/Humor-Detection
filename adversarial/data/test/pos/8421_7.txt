Very disappointed.  \n\nMy friends and I decided to do a quick weekend trip to LV for my birthday.  We looked at a few different laser tag places, and thought this one would be the best since it was advertised as a 3 story laser tag room.  When we got there we filled out the release form, then were told that the computer we did it on was not working, and we have to sign a new physical waiver (you'd think they would have a sign or something on the computer).  After we signed the waiver for a second time we paid for 1 game.  \n\nAfter our first game was over we decided we'd play one more game before leaving.  We went up to the front to purchase another game, but the girl manning the cash register said she had already closed them down - 25 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING!  And keep in mind each game is 12 minutes.  We asked her if there was anyway we could play one another game, as we had just drove 30 minutes from our hotel to get there.  The front desk girl said we would have to talk to the guy in charge of laser tag.  We went to him and explained that we assumed we would get to play at least 2 games due to their closing time, and the length of the games.  His response was that he already put the vests up to charge, and he didn't want to take any of them down.  This place was just riddled with lazy employees.  The place was surprisingly dead for a Friday night, and you'd think they would be happy to accept more money from customers already in their facility - guess I was wrong.  \n\nWould not recommend this place.
