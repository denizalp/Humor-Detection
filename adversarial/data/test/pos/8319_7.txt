Listen and Listen well. If you have a modicum of taste, if you have ever had a steak in Nebraska, if you like flavor, then aviod this poorly crafted steak place.\n\nIt's funny to think  that Collichio has the audacity to rip other chefs.  Craftsteak is no better than Outback.  \n\n\nThere were so many infractions on the field here I dont know were to begin.  \n\nThe first yellow card was waiting for an inordinately long time for service.  The waiter was slow and dilatory.  And, his explanation on mushrooms was not even an explanation.  I asked what types of mushrooms were listed and he said, \"just get the assortment you will get all the mushrooms then.\"  Thanks Casper, thats a hell of an idea.  I could have thought of that one myself.  But, I would still like to know what types of mushrooms I can anticipate. \n\nThe second yellow card, came with waiting after I had finished my beer.  I was not asked if I would like another until the meal was served.  That was 10min after I finished my first.  \n\nTwo yellows is a red.  Now you are a man down.\n\nThe thrid, fourth, and fifth yellows came in quick succession.\n\nSome idiot in the back went hog-wild with the Sea Salt.  I thought they pulled the cow from the bottom of Salt Lake.  Ya know Collichio a little salt goes a long way. \n\nIf there is a chef in the world who can actually impart flavor on to asparagus, then he aint working at Craftsteak.  You know make the veggies exciting.  I guess Toby from Top Chef said it right, \"its like the bland leading the bland.\"  \n\nThe ribs and steak were not lean. They were infused with fat.  Our cows definitly had Type II diabetes.  They were the fatest cows in the lot.  Given their poor taste and texture, they were probably Nascar fans to boot.\n\n I really wouldnt care so much but dont try to be a top notch steak house.  I've had better steaks in Portland, Omaha, and Worcester. \n\nSave your money go for a mid range restaurant and buy your girl a nice gift.  But, dont even think about spending one moment in the most uncomfortable chair in the world just to eat this unsavory hodgepodge of mediocrity.\n\nWith so many infractions, all I can say is Chef Collichio please pack up your knives and leave.
