Ive bought and sold clothes here for years.\n\nThe ladies behind the counter are always nice, and helpful. The racks are a little cramped, but theyre stocked w\/ some great stuff. New and gently used shoes, a great selection of purses, and lots of kitchy jewelry.\n\nAs far as what they buy, theyre \"less exclusive\" than say Buffalo Exchange. So if you have something thats in really good condition chances are theyll take it. Ya never know, and it never hurts to bring something in.
