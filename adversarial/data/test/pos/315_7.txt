People get married here ? How sad . I have never left a hotel feeling dirty and disgusting, skin crawling. In fact, I have never left a hotel early to drive for home at 10 at night, all the way to a different state, because I was so sick of the hotel, the poor management, and the trash riff-raff walking in and out. Stay here if youre an EDC idiot that needs a place to crash and bang your friends. They don't mind partying in the hall ways at four in the morning. They don't mind people having sex RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR ROOM, they don't mind DIRTY, USED CONDOMS laying on the ground, right outside your room. And they don't mind things falling off the wall, almost hitting you. Decorations are precariously hung in a sickening excessive amount, (no wonder they keep is SO DARK - - the place is FILTHY) complete with drink stains and all. They don't mind BLOOD ON THE BOX SPRING. Yes, blood. Not a little spot. A disgusting large streak and splatter of blood, blatantly on the outside of the box spring. There is no one available for help at early mornings to assist in any type of complaint, and when you do get to finally complain, you're lucky to get a \"sorry\". I stayed here because it was close to the convention center. What a joke - I am utterly embarrassed to even admit I stayed here. This place is for college kids that have no idea how behave or act, creeps looking for half naked drunk girls to slip a roofie, and for the dirty escorts looking for work and nasty men who enjoy this kind of place for a \"good time\". I will never stay here again, nor will anyone I know. NOT FOR ANYONE WITH ANY TYPE OF RESPECT, CLASS, OR CONCERN FOR THEIR WELL BEING AND SAFETY. No bed bug bites though, guess that's a plus.
