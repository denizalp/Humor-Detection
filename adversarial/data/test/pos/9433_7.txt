I'll confess (this is a private forum, right?): sometimes I have a love\/hate relationship with Toronto that skews towards the latter.  But thankfully, when I'm feeling a little down on the Tee-dot-Oh, I know where I can hurry to in order to instantly lift my spirits: the Evergreen Brick Works Farmers' Market.\n\nSaturday mornings here are busy: don't think that the secret about the Brick Works has yet to get out (tip #1: if you can walk or bike down it'll save you the mad scramble to find parking).  Popularity with good reason, though: this ain't yo' run of the mill market.  Brick Works Farmers' Market is dogs, and babies, and dogs WITH babies!  It's music, and community demonstrations, and nature walks.  It's eat-while-you-stroll prepared food, it's farm-fresh produce, it's community.  \n\nHighlights from recent visits include: sea asparagus (who knew?), freshly fried sweet potato donut holes, rows of beautifully packaged condiments, hand-spun crepes, organic baked goods and a can't-miss in the heat wave: handmade all-natural herb and fruit popsicles.  \n\nVendors, though sometimes slammed with visitors to their stall, have never been anything but patient with questions, generous with time, and easy with the smiles.  Some products can be pricey, but I happily pay a premium for both the quality and the experience.\n\nYelp note: although the Saturday market is an obvious draw, the Evergreen Brick Works space is worth a visit at other times of the week, too.  From outdoor yoga, to classes, to trail exploring in the ravine...Brick Works is a great addition to the Toronto landscape (literally, figuratively).
