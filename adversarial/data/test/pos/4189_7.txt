All the stars! I love this place. I brought a friend with me today to get back facials. Once again, a very pleasant experience with not one, two, three, four but FIVE hot towels. Cecelia made sure I was comfortable as she massaged my back and upper arms, using different oils, scrubs and lotions. It lasted about 50 minutes and cost $20. I found out today that they accept tips, which is good for the students. I didn't know this last time since I just used a Groupon. So, please tip! They do a great job here and the prices can't be beat.
