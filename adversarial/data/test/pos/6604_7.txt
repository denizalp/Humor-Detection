Over priced and under staffed.  The food was mediocre at best and I've eaten A Lot of Mexican food.  \n\nThey charge for a side of sour cream, more chips and splitting a plate.  Service was absolutely terrible.  Took forever to get our server to show up to take our drink or, then our food order and to get us our bill and then bring back our card and receipt to sign.  \n\nI will never eat here again and definitely NEVER recommend this place.
