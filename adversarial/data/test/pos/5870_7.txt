When they greet you by name that's when you know you go there too often. I never realized how much Starbucks I actually drinks (except I bet you guys do because you always see how many times I check in to them). This location is always very nice to me and has my mobile orders ready whenever I get there. They make them pretty good (because I always ask for extra ice or extra thick) and they make it to my liking. It's hard to find parking sometimes because this plaza is busy, but this Starbucks is in a pretty handy dandy location just off the strip on Spring Mountain and Valley View. I like to get white chocolate mocha fraps or java chip fraps. When it's summertime, my go-to iced drink is the peach green tea lemonade (with strawberries). Yay for Starbucks!
