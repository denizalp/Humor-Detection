The hotel is whatever. Nothing special. \n\nBut their valet and parking attendants are not very polite. \n\nI pulled up to valet and he refused to park my car unless I promised to \"take care of their employees\" on my way in and out. I don't think so. I always tip valet but I don't like when an employee rudely tells me he won't park my car unless I do. \n\nPlus they charge for parking in their parking lot that isn't even that close to the casino.\n\nIt's also impossible to find a bathroom.
