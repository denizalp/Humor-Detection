Considering that I am not spending one dime of my money for this rental, I am quite excited.  This is an older location.  Kind of beat up looking, but planted right in the middle of a few local dealerships, its easy to spot from the road.\n\nGoing in, the place looks a bit tired and older.  I have to say, the staff here was FABULOUS!  The guy behind the counter was SO funny, and helped me quickly get in and out!  They even picked me up from the dealership!  Holla!\n\nStaff made this place amazing.  :-)
