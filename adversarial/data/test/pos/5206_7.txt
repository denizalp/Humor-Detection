I'll be the first to admit, I'm a little choosy about where I grocery shop. I look for three major things - quality produce, quality meat and prices. \n\nI have a growing family and we shop weekly and for me that usually consists of 2-3 trips to separate stores because I refuse to buy meat and produce at Walmart.\n\nFor whatever reason, my husband suggested checking out the commissary and as a mother and wife it was practically heaven.\n\nFirst stop, produce section, very clean and everything looks fresh - there's a great variety as well. \n\nI stopped by the deli counter (they carry Boar's head) and was impressed with the quality there as well. \n\nI wasn't super pleased with the meat department (it's not Walmart quality but I'm weird) I was able to pick up a huge pork shoulder for $10 and couldn't pass that up.\n\nWhat was best for me was that they carried literally everything I would've normally made a separate shopping trip for...sippy cups? Shampoo? Even the dog food that we normally have to travel to Pet Smart for!\n\nThey were well stocked and very organized with the upcoming holiday.\n\nIf you have the privilege of coming in here, definitely make the trip.
