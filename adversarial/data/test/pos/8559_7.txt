First of all, China Wok is located in the Food 4 Less parking lot on Craig and Simmons. \nSecondly-- Holy crap! How is this place NOT getting at least four stars? I'm always skeptical about Chinese food so if I'm impressed, I think that means something. \n\nI called in my order on a Saturday and the woman on the phone was super friendly. She said the food would be ready in ten minutes but it was actually more like 20 minutes, which was relieving because 10 minutes would have been suspicious. We got three lunch specials (shrimp in garlic sauce, shrimp and broccoli and Mongolian chicken), one order of egg rolls and one order of crab rangoons. The lunch specials each came with a side of rice (fried or steamed). All the food tasted fresh, the shrimp were gigantic (about 5 or 6 pieces per order), and the order of crag rangoons was generous for the price (about 10 large pieces.) \n\nThey advertise that they're \"New York Style\" and I'm not sure what this means because it seemed to be the same \"style\" as any other take-out Chinese food restaurant in the Las Vegas area. But in China Wok's favor-- the menu is huge, the food is fresh and flavorful, and portions for the lunch specials are generous for $5.95. \n\nIn the three dishes we got, the meat to vegetables ratio was probably 2 to 5, which is great for someone interested in healthier fare but possibly disappointing for someone who's expecting a lot of meat. Anyway, the variety of vegetables was good and the meat is good quality.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is kind of run-down looking but when you look closely, it's very clean and well-kept. I guess the age of the building and the style of the furniture just don't really help it out at all.\n\nThe cashier asked me if I'd like some soup while I waited and I declined, but it's a gesture worth noting. \n\nOverall, I'm actually looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu. Fresh, healthier food for $5.95 a plate? Hell yeah. That's cheaper than a meal at a lot of fast food restaurants.
