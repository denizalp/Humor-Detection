As a bagel connoisseur (I'm a Jew, it's in my genes) I'll have to say that these are some of the best bagels I've had. It's no Rosenfeld's, that's for sure but I suppose it's hard to compare French-Canadian bagels to Jewton, MA bagels. So, I'll just say these are some of the best, if not THE best bagels in the city. \n\nHere's what you do: \n\n1.Buy a dozen bagels(prefereably of whatever was just baked), a package of lox and a nicely sized tub of cream cheese. \n\n2. Find a nice spot outside (park bench, etc. etc.) or your brother's car. \n\n3. Be the designated bagel maker for ALL FOUR PEOPLE IN THE EFFING CAR \n\n4. Slice a bagel, smear with cream cheese, layer with lox. Devour. Repeat. \n\n5. Exclaim: Oy vey! or Mon dieu!! (considering the locale) etc. etc. \n\nThere you have it. 12 bagels serve 4 with 4 bagels leftover. (you do the math).
