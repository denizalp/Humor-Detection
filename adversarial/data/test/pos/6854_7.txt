Enticing scents of Oriental cuisine waft through the air & draw hungry guests into it's embrace... Blossom tempts even before you step inside.\n\nAn elegant, authentic Chinese eatery, Blossom is a beautifully designed space with sleek, Asian-style decor. Our group of four comfortably sat in one of the great booths along the wall, which allowed for great views of the restaurant. Blossom wasn't busy on a Wednesday evening around 9p, but I'd still recommend making a reservation to ensure your party gets a nice spot.\n\nService was friendly but a bit bizarre. We inquired about certain items on the menu since dish names are vague & descriptions are short. We specifically asked about the Pan Fried Stuffed Shrimp Moss on Tofu & Pepper.... what is moss? Our waiter gave a really odd reply, saying that the shrimp's set on top of the tofu & 'looks like moss,' hence the name. Hmm. We rolled with it, but when the dish came out, it was obvious that our waiter had never eaten nor served it before. Or perhaps the kitchen gave us a different meal altogether... we'll never know! Either way it was so delicious and overall our favorite order. The cubes of tofu were delicately crispy on the outside but so smooth inside. And surprise!... a little shrimp is waiting for you in the center of each square - so good! Beware of the the shrimp stuffed peppers though - they are so so so SPICY.\n\nThe beef of the Mongolian Beef was quality and tender, but the sauce was a little too sweet for our liking. The Spicy Indian-Style Fried Rice wasn't really spicy at all and the plate presentation was lacking.\n\nIn any case, the food and ambiance of Blossom were very good, and I'd definitely return to explore more of the vast menu.
