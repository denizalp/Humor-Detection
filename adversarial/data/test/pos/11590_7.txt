My Father recently passed away after a year in at-home Hospice care for end stage Alzheimer's Disease, and a decade + of decline. Following his last wishes, once he passed away peacefully at home, Hospice called Kraft-Sussman and they removed his body with dignity and respect. \n\nThey followed our wishes - which won't include a service until a Mass in the future - and were extremely kind and supportive. My Dad's cremains were returned when promised in a lovely urn we chose. They also printed beautiful prayer cards including a favorite photo of him, and a saying he always found meaningful. \n\nTo everything there is a season, when death visits your loved ones, I'd highly recommend Kraft-Sussman to help you navigate such a difficult time.
