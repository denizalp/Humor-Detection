If I could sit on an air conditioned couch with a beer and immediately enjoy my nachos, this place would be five stars but, alas, I have to wait to get home... therefore, only four. But four grateful, guilty pleasure, love-filled stars!\n\n$7 for a heaping, i-am-somewhat-ashamed-for-nearly-finishing-them-myslef-sized serving of SUPER nachos. Movie theater style tortilla chips, doused in (what I like to call) \"fake\" cheese, carne asada, jalapenos, salsa, guacamole and sour cream... consuming them is an entirely unhealthy act of gluttony -- one in which we should all spoil ourselves and indulge on occasion!\n\nThey're only open Thursday - Sunday and mostly with late night hours: \nThu: 9:00 pm - 3:00 am \nFri - Sat: 9:00 pm - 4:30 am \nSun: 4:00 pm - 3:00 am
