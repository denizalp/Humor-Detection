I really used to love PLRG--a lot. I've spent lots of money shopping at both stores in the past. I've consigned a few things. However the attitude of the staff the last time I was there kept me away for well over a year. \n\nI follow them on IG and see tons of cute stuff so decided last week to give it another shot. Went in and literally no one spoke, looked up, or even acknowledged me. I looked around for 10 minutes and an employee walked around me several times shelving items--still didn't speak or ask if I needed help. I finally approach her to ask if they still do by the dates sales. \n\nOnly after I picked out a couple items did she come to ask about starting a fitting room. I had her place the items in a fitting room. I couldn't help but notice 3 other ladies who were being helped and how the staff laughed it up with them and was extra helpful to them. Besides this group was only myself and 1 other lady shopping so not busy there at all. I told the employee that I wouldn't need a dressing room and walked out. \n\nMy husband was shocked I didn't return to the car with at least 2 big bags lol.I decided to take my hard earned money elsewhere and was sooooo glad I did! Walked out another store with 3 dresses a cute skirt and lots of other stuff--brand new. Not sure if I'll ever go back to PLRG. I hope the owner reads these reviews and educates the staff on what customer service means--I see several other reviews with a similar experience. I'll never spend a dime in any business that treats me like they're doing me a favor allowing me to spend my money there.
