There was one drink I have always enjoyed was a Cosmo. I typically liked drinks that weren't too strong; only a bit of an alcohol taste but enough to know it was there, just like vodka mixed with cranberry(pineapple)juice or fruity drinks,,very simple drinks... \nWell, I had a little changed in my taste buds. There are very few liquors that I enjoy drinking straight. So, I love cocktail drinks. However, I like my mixed drink not too much taste like sugar-candy either. \nI think I found a place to have some unique cocktails in town :) \nI went on a Friday night (not on First Friday) around 6:30pm. Wasn't crowded at all. I have tried three different drinks this time: \n1. Vanguard Cider \n\n(Maker's Mark, Belle De Billet, House Made Cider, Spiced Foam, Served Hot or Cold) Tried it as cold(the bartender recommended to drink as cold) and liked it a lot! \n\n2. Hard 8 \n\n(Bacardi 8, Pernod bath, Sliced Fresh Lime, Bitters, Ginger Beer, Peychaud Bitters) Very refreshing, contained lots of crushed ice cube in the drink. It was interesting to see the bartender wasn't just throwing the ice cube in the drink. He was beating the ice cubes into small pieces in a bag using w\/a wooden stick. I thought it would be a good cocktail in the hot summer time. Well, I still enjoyed it. \n\n3. Broken Flowers \n(Hendricks Gin, Lillet Blanc, DiFlora Syrup, Rhubarb Bitters, Orange Bitters) Very simple and smooth taste.. I would recommend to the ladies :) \n\nThe decor was hip and nice. The drinks were unique and well made by skilled bartender. \nThe Vanguard Lounge is for the perfect small cocktail party, social evening on week nights, or just a few drinks with friends on weekends. I love to come back here little early in the evening when there is a less of wait and will start the night out here. \nMy final verdict... My kind of place, hee hee. I can see myself coming here often :P
