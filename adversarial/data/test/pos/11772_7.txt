I had the large cheese pizza. While I sat and waited I observed the following. Phones have the most germs on them of almost anything.\n\nThe young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.\n\nThe young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.\n\nPizza was fine, but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.\n\nOn a previous visit I had the gyro sandwich. I found it to be very wet and gooey, not much flavor at all to the meat.\n\nMy last visit. I will say the pizza prices are fair for what they are offering. \n\nMy problem is the lack of being sanitary.
