Nice family runs this store, and it has all the basics you need priced at convenience store prices.  Thy have fresh meat, vegetables, all the regular food staples and misc stationary etc.\n\nWhy you need to stop by, or at least do a drive by is for the food poster in the window.  If you need a smile, it's just the thing, or at least it makes me smile, and maybe that says something juvenile about me, but so be it!\n\nThat food poster has been there awhile, and has wrinkled....in all the right places.  That's all I'm saying.  Do a walk by, promise, you will smile;)\n\nxoxo
