Great breakfast place near the South Mountain Pima Canyon Access.\n\nWe came here on Sunday around 8:30am after hiking nearby, and I enjoyed my breakfast here.\n\nI noticed there are a lot of chairs outside the restaurant, although they weren't busy at all when we arrived, I bet they get really busy later on the day.  In fact when we left the restaurant around 9:30am they were about 80% full.\n\nI had Southwest Egg Benedict. Spicy chorizo patty went well with avocado. It was just a bit spicy but it wasn't overwhelming at all. It was just right and tasted good. Poached egg was cooked perfectly. When I cut it half I was really happy to see slightly runny yolk. Adobo Hollandaise sauce tasted good too. While I really enjoy traditional Hollandaise sauce, this southwestern flavored complimented the egg benedict pretty well.\n\nCoffee was blah... just what I anticipated. I would skip coffee next time, and will get a cup of coffee afterwords somewhere else.
