Been here twice now, and I love the atmosphere and the old school vinyl action, and the service we got from the girl with short hair who wore a hat during the Yelp Bazaar\nwas very nice, helpful and informative in explaning their menu items to us even though we didn't purchase anything.\n\nOn this visit, it was like day and night...Ordered a Cappucino and a Mocha, both cups were totally covered with foam, and I honestly couldn't tell them apart. So I ask the barrista(more like BIATCHRISTA) which one's which?\n\nStraight-faced, she answers \"the one with chocolate\", and goes about her business...REALLY Mofo!?!?!?!\n\nMust've been the same snot that Raven L. recieved crappy service from.\nCoffee wasn't all that, and even more disappointing was the highly overrated Crap and Tickle sandwich...don't believe the hype!....ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(128\/365) \"Totally Missed a Beat\"
