Came here for the first time on Friday evening for dinner with some friends. Having the anticipation of ANOTHER restaurant from Seoul bringing some authentic Korean foods to Vegas, it was quite the wait but well worth it. \n\nEver since going to Seoul in April 2016, my best friend and I have been on the hunt for some good Korean food as close as we can get. Luckily for us, in the past 2 years, more and more establishments has been appearing in Vegas partially satisfying our craving. Aside from Hobak being KBBQ so entirely different category, places like Kkulmat and TangTangTang popping up, it had made the variety of Korean food available in Vegas much more easily accessible vs traveling to even Koreatown in LA. There are even korean street\/bar food places popping up (YasikNara\/Hon Pocha) ! \n\nGarionban had its soft opening in the beginning of the month but unfortunately for myself, was busy and couldn't visit this place that soon. Located in the plaza east of Joyful House, near 8 Ounce and Jubilee Furniture, it is a small but simple, modern restaurant with a good amount of seating. Their tables are wood tops with their brand name burned into the table corner. One unique thing is they have a drawer built into the table, like many restaurants in Korean, which holds the napkins, chopsticks, and spoons. Unfortunately, for our party of 9, they pushed two tables together which so happened to both face each other so drawers became no drawers. Lol \n\nTheir menu is fairly simple. Lunch specials (Avail 1100A - 230P). \n\nThey have a specialty ox tail\/bone\/beef brisket soup they use as a base for all their soups. I tried the Garigukbap which is the beef brisket soup. They also have a spicy version. Ingredients include sliced egg strips, a ball of noodles, tender falling apart slices of brisket, and rectangle logs of tofu. The one thing thats different from this soup base and one from like TangTangTang is that theirs is pre-seasoned. TangTangTang lets you add your own salt to your own preference. Along with a bowl of rice, and the included housemade kimchi and radish, this is a meal in itself ! So yummy ! \n\nWe also ordered some Jjin mandu, which are HUGE HOUSEMADE steamed dumplings with pork and mixed vegetables. Couldn't really tell which veggies but they were all julienned (if they arent like that normally, if it was like beansprouts) and i think a mixture of pork and maybe egg. The veggies adds a lot of crunchy texture to the rest of the soft textures from the meat\/skin\/etc. Friend mentioned it was tofu but i feel like it was closer to egg. Who knows? Kind of reminded me of this pork\/egg dish popular in viet cuisine. Each order comes with 6 but each dumplings are BIG ! At least 2 bites, even for me XD ! Definitely could eat like 3 orders myself but thats without eating anything else. HAHA ! \n\nNow they final order, is the Bossam (Boiled Pork Slices) + Suyuk Jokbal (Boiled Pork Leg Slices) special combo ! ! Since we were a party of 9, we decided to order the large to share. HOLY CRAP THIS WAS BIG ! ehehehe... SO MUCH MEAT ! hehehe... They recommended the \"Soy Sauce Garlic & Ginger\" for sauce for the seasoned pork leg as its most \"authentic\". For those that don't know, Bossam is boiled pork belly, typically in a seasoned broth\/water for some color and flavor. Slices of pork belly are placed on leaves of napa cabbage topped with slices of raw garlic, jalapenos, bean paste, fermented shrimp, and pickled daikon strips all ate in a small wrap. They also provide perilla (sesame) leaves too. As for the Suyuk Jokbal, it is a huge leg they had slowly roasted or boiled with all that fat\/collagen all broken down. Super flavorful. Great as is. I would eat this with some sauce and rice any day. Wasn't sure if you are supposed to eat this like the bossam but we essentially ate it straight up. Too good ! Highly recommended dish. It IS a LOT of food but eh take it to go ! XD \n\nService was really good. Our pitcher of water was never empty. They cleared things out as fast as they could. Split our bill like 5 times without complaint. \n\nMy new fav place for korean soups as well as the best bossam and jokbal in town ! Looking forward to my next visit already as soon as I left !
