Their staff are all so friendly and helpful. They are very eager to help you and answer any questions you might have. \nI am not a frequent juicer because it is just too much work to juice at home... the preparation and clean up is just too much for me to justify. Which is why I love that juicerys are finally opening up in Vegas.\n\nThe prices here are reasonable...around 10$ a juice with a ton of options for you to choose from. Unicorn's Blood is delicious! I see a lot of people have an issue with the fact that they bottle their juices, but I actually love that. I am there to grab what I need and go. If I wanted to watch a my juice be made in front of me, I'd do it at home. \n\nI'll definitely be back.
