if i could give this place no stars, I would. This place isnt even runned by a filipino owner itself. The food sucks, i would rather stay home and eat my familys home cooked filipino dish, the owner herself is RUDE! everything about this place is HORRIBLEEE!!!! Letting everyone know not to even bother spending a penny at this shit hole. I would love to talk about how they treat the people here, but id rather just keep my mouth shut for that. Overall, i suggest you all not to dine here.
