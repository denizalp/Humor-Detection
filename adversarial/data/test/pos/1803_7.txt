I was in the general area and stopped here for breakfast.  This has been a bookmark for over a year and now I have one less.\n\nI felt guilty taking up a four top dining alone but this is a relatively small place with no counter and no two tops.  I was brought coffee quickly.  They offer you Half and Half in flavors but since I drink my coffee black, that's nice to have available but it doesn't affect me.\n\nI ordered the Wisconsin Omelette with rye toast and batter bites for my potato.  The omelette was OK but all I saw and tasted was some sliced cheddar like I'd buy in a big bag at any grocery.  There was no pepper jack nor Swiss cheese that I could discern.  Had I read the menu a little more carefully, I wouldn't have been disappointed by the batter bites.  Look at the words and what do you think?  The batter bites were in fact home fries.  There's no batter to them.  The menu describes them as fried seasoned potatoes.  I was thinking of something more in the tater tot line but that was not the case.\n\nMy coffee was refilled without asking and there were always servers going around asking about refills.  I hurried to finish because the place was getting busy again and I wanted to let someone with a larger party have the table.\n\nAn OK place but not a return to place.  It's out of the way for me and just not worth it.  \n\nBatter bites?  That's going to bother me for some time to come.
