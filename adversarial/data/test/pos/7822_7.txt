Okay, so I have now tried the two SPORT gyms most closest to where I live and I have to say that this location seems so much \"newer and lively\" compared to the Silverado location. The overall interior seems fresh, bright and clean. I feel the \"openness\" more at this gym, compared to the Silverado location. I don't feel that cramped feeling, like I feel at Silverado. \n\nToday I tried the Bodypump class with Owen, which is offered Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 0800-0900. I love this class because it's an all over body workout that works, legs, backs, gluts, arms and shoulders! You can control the amount of weight and the class is easy to follow. No intimidation here, try the class! \n\nI would make this primary gym, but they DON'T have a cycle room, like WTF right? So weird. I've never been to a gym that didn't have a cycle room this is a first! Looks like I'll be sharing my time between the Silverado location for spin\/cycle and the Wigwam location for my Bodypump needs. \n\nP.S. I read a lot of reviews 'bout the air conditioning not working; it was working today!
