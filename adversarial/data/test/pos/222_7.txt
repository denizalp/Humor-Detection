For an impatient, not-so-coordinated, accident-prone person like me, mini golf is my go-to outdoor activity. I've been to three other mini-golf courses, and this is the most family friendly! The course is a little shorter than most, but the employees here are nice, it's not crowded (so I can't publicly embarrass myself too much), and the course isn't too easy (granted, that may not mean much coming from me). \n\nI am definitely coming back to this place, and I plan on bringing my younger siblings! This place is great for families, a casual date, or even for a solo adventure to practice becoming a pro-mini-golfer.
