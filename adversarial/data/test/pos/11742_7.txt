WTF was I thinking?\n\nI had many an opportunity to ask myself this during our 2-night stay in this shitefest.\n\nSome friends and I - most from overseas - were roadtripping it for a bit and decided on whim to pull into Vegas. Couldn't find those $19 rooms of yore, as a convention was happening in Sin City and hotel prices were actually - well - like regular hotel prices. And nearly everyone was booked. Called around a day before or so and found this hostel to accommodate us all with a private room at 80USD a night. Sounded decent, and being the traveling-backpacking-not-needing-exceptional-luxury-when-traveling sort we are, credit card numbers were given and off we went.\n\nGot a bit leery as we pulled into the parking lot. It was so shady I didn't want to park there, even though there was a gate with a padlock that apparently pulled shut. I wanted to stay with the car, afraid it would get stolen. It was 10am.\n\nInside, the jerkoff behind the counter was romancing the gaggle of foreign nitwits. \"Uh...I love foreign accents\" he cooed at the scantily-clad 20-somethings who ate it all up. Blah blah blah blah blah they carried on, as my friends and I waited in disbelief for him to begin doing what he was meant to: checking them in. \n\nWhen it was finally our turn, we all came up to the counter and I pulled out my passport for checkin. \"Uh...whoa. You can't stay here. This place is for foreigners only\" jerkoff asserted. I was livid. Nobody told me this when I made the reservation, I retorted. Oh no, everyone knows this - everyone is told this, jerkoff countered. So I asked him if it made much sense that in a group of friends partially consisting of US citizens, I would continue making a reservation knowing I couldn't stay here. \n\nIn the midst of this debate, he mumbled something about foreigners and students. Luckily, I still had my (presently expired) college ID on hand. Well, you didn't say you were a student, he exclaimed. I guess you can stay here. Well thank effing christ, because at that point I don't know what we would've done with all of the Strip booked up, I thought.\n\nSo jerkoff carried on, telling us about the rules and amenities. And then tried to sell us on a fantabulous limo ride along the Strip at night, where everyone got like, really mad shit-faced to the point where they wanted to puke. And then got into the limo and went to another bar. Like this was a selling point. \n\nI started laughing at him, wondering how on earth this early 30-something got by in life. And why drinking till you vomited in a limo with a bunch of obnoxious strangers would be any fun. I guess I must've be weird, because he looked at me, all offended, and asked what my problem was.\n\nHad everything else not been full, had we had more time, had money been no consideration, had we been less ballsy - we never would have stayed here. But we did. And never will again.\n\nOh yeah, and the rooms were shit. I've stayed in many a hostel, and yes - it is possible to find clean, comfortable, inexpensive accommodation. But not here at usahostel.
