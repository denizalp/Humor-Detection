A good old-fashioned produce market just like we used to have back home:  rough floor (in this case old macadam), crude wooden tables, and nothing else but pallets and bins of fruits and vegetables.  The prices were quite low; I don't know how they compare to local groceries but it is cheap as hell compared to Chicago prices.\n\nOne complaint:  Much of the wares were displayed in pre-packaged styrafoam trays covered with plastic.  Not only is this wasteful (I hate extraneous packaging) it removes the freedom of choice from the buyer's hands.  I may only want ONE of an item, not two or three or six, and I'm picky, so I want to find the PERFECT one.  Neither was an option for much of the produce that I saw there this past Sunday.
