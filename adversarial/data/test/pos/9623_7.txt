Came here for lunch at 12:30 on a nice 78 degree day in November. After doing a search on Yelp, this barbeque joint popped up on the Yelp list. I love barbeque so off I went.\n\nAt first I thought it was probably gonna be packed since it was lunch time but the place was empty. Weird. \n\nIm for all things beef so I went with the Two Meat Combo ($15) of Brisket and Tri-Tip with a side of Cowboy Fries (for a $1.50 more). Ordering those two meats were a dollar more each extra. To wash it down, I added a fountain drink ($2). Total with tax was $21.08. Damn. \n\nI guess they did me a favor by only charging me a dollar extra instead of two for the two meats? So confusing. Still, anything over 20 bucks for lunch better be worth it.\n\nSo while I was waiting for my order, I read a couple reviews. One of them they said the brisket was dry. Another said the tri-tip was dry also. What? Those are the two meats I ordered! So before my order came out I was already a bit worried.\n\nIf you refer to my pic you get about the same amount of food as you would other barbeque joints. The Brisket was actually quite juicy and you can taste the smokiness to it. The Tri-Tip was a little dry because it was overcooked just a bit. The Cowboy Fries were basically crinkle cut fries topped off with beans, onions, and cheese. Not bad at all.\n\nService was just ok. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Nothing overly special about that.\n\nOn your table they have a mild and a spicy barbeque sauce for you to add to you meal. The mild had a sweet tang to it while the spicy had chipotle flavor to it with just right amount of kick. I ended up mixing the two together because I liked both sauces.\n\nSome random info: They take cards. When you check in on Yelp, you get free dessert. They have tables and chairs set up outside if you want to eat out there. Parking is along side the street.\n\nOverall, I thought the food was decent but kind of pricey. In comparison to my favorite bbq joint in Vegas, you can get a THREE meat combo for 15 bucks. Feel free to message me if you want to know what place that is. Since I havnt tried their ribs yet, I think that is just enough to warrant another trip out here in the future. Until then, the hefty price I paid will linger with me for quite sometime.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #191
