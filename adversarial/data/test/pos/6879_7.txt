They really do have the best katsu in Vegas!  I was surprised I have not been back for a few years now.  Stumbling upon a Groupon finally brought me back and I see myself coming back more often now.\n\nTonkatsu Kiyoshi makes the most tender and meaty on the inside and crunchy on the outside chicken katsu.  I've been to many Hawaiian\/Japanese places and nothing is comparable.  The chicken katsu curry ($11) was served with a generous amount of rice, and a side of miso soup and salad.  The curry was excellent with chunks of carrot and potato.\n\nThe salmon katsu ($15) was also very good. It comes with a cabbage salad with delicious ponzu dressing, side of pickled onions, and miso soup.  I love that you can customize your own katsu sauce with the provided sesame seeds and katsu sauce at the table.  \n\nThe melon soda float was good, but for me a one and done kind of thing. \n\nThe menu offers appetizers like karaage, shishito peppers, and sliders, which I will have to try on a future visit.  They also have a dessert menu that includes a green tea cheesecake, which I also plan to try next time.\n\nService was on point here and super friendly.  Staff was attentive and knowledgeable and made great suggestions.\n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n55\/100
