Authentic, delicious food that keeps me coming back for more! I had driven by a few times and the place is always busy, finally pulled it up on yelp to see what the buzz was about. Simple menu, salsa bar, bottled soda good friendly service, what more could a taco stand offer? Backyard Tacos offers that and more, chicken and beef street tacos in your preference of corn or flour tortillas, quesadillas, tostadas, burritos, gorditas and tortas, chips and salsa galore! The meat is tender, flavored well and grilled to perfection! The burritos are huge and packed with flavor. Their salsa bar is always fresh and loaded with Pico, salsa Verde, chipotle\/fire roasted sauce, cucumbers, and guacamole. Even the sour cream is eye rolling amazing! We have gone several times, never once been disappointed! Fantastic food and friendly service, we love BYT!\n\nBYT offers a Repeat Eater card 10 stamps=free meal!\nCheck in on Yelp for their bag of free chips and salsa!
