I'd like to preface this review with these things:\n\n1.  I am attempting to knock some things off my bucket list and horse back riding was one of them.\n2.  I do not generally care for animals and do not usually think they are cute.\n3.  I pretend like I embrace the \"everybody poops\" mantra but pooping is kind of gross to me.\n\nI was lucky enough to go horseback riding this past Sunday morning.  I went with a large group of seventeen people so we had reserved the breakfast ride.  They had requested our heights and weights earlier in order to assign us a horse that could hold us.  The people working at the stable were super friendly and accommodating.  We went for an hour long ride without much incident and the guides were great about making sure we knew what we were doing, giving us tips and pointing out random rock formations.\n\nMore on the actual riding:  I know that this is something off my bucket list, so I expected it to be an amazing experience.  Sky diving was the thing I knocked off before this, and it didn't really compare.  I know that seems obvious, but I was actually kind of bored with the whole riding the horse thing.  I was also perplexed by all the defecating going on.  AND, if you are behind a horse and it poops, YOU HAVE to look.  Needless to say, I was pretty anti-anus on this day.  \n\nBack to the task at hand:  If you are interested in horse back riding, I would highly suggest Ponderosa Stables.  It was only $35 a piece for our breakfast ride which was an hour long ride and a standard breakfast at the end (pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon and breakfast drinks).  They even built us a little bonfire to go with our breakfast.  The people that work here are super helpful and cool.
