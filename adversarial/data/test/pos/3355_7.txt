As the name implies, this is a pretty big one. Parking is great. There's a whole slew of restaurants and coffee places to visit before or after the movie. Lots of big  box stores you can also kill time at while waiting for your movie. I personally like to hit the Dollarama and buy some of those wet naps. Great to keep in the backpack. As well, you can load up on some 69 cent chocolate bars and sneak them into the theater. You're even a short walk away from a Five Guys. (Sure you can drive over there and the \"north of Toronto\" ethic expects you to drive but I need the exercise.)\n\nOkay, the theater itself. There is that IMAX theater all jerked out for 3D and digital sound systems with 3 letter acronyms that I think all just mean \"loud\". the IMAX experience has never, for my money, been worth the extra $3 or $4. First you need to get the sweet spot. And that means lining up a long time before the movie starts. And the sweet spot means dead center. Which is a bitch for people like me who like to go to the bathroom twice during a 2 hour movie. Look, I have small bladder and I drink a lot of liquids. The screen isn't all that big to start with (not like some of the museum IMAX experiences). \n\nPurchasing food is a pain. You seem to have to line up to buy it at the main kiosk and then line up again to pick it up at the specialty kiosk. And last time I went I just wanted a coffee and the guy at the coffee kiosk was AWOL. I waited 10 minutes and then just walked over to the Second Cup and got my coffee there.\n\nThey have this new AVX theater similar to the version found at the AMC Dundas 24. I found the AMC Dundas version a lot, lot better. The AMC version is bigger and way more immersive. The Colossus version is just a big screen in front of you. This theater does have \"rocker' seats that recline a bit. Seattle's venerable Cinerama had this kind of seating for  years, although lacking the high back chair aspect and the stadium seating. The Colossus implementation was quite a bit nicer.\n\nWashrooms are outside the ticketed area. I hate that. You have to remember to bring your ticket with you when you go to the can. And theaters are not contiguous so you're mostly SOL for a 2-4-1 on DL. \n\nThere are a lot of Star Wars and Star Trek prop that abound. It makes for a more festive experience. Nothing like a fire breathing dragon at the theater at the West Edmonton mall but still. And unlike nearly every theater in downtown Toronto you get far less douche bags talking and texting next to you.
