Up and coming local spot with very friendly and motivated staff. The owner Pat is great about making his guests feel welcome, even going so far as to share his closed WiFi with me when I posted up at his bar to run my fantasy draft - very cool of him to do so. \n\nThe staff ... Earl, Nikki, Christina ... are just great. Making small talk, drink suggestions and being generally good folks to meet that gives Pints the warmth you want to see in your local pub.\n\nIt's that sort of personal attention, folksy-ness and just plain coolness that made me say: \"Hey self, we just moved to the block buddy. We're new, they're new ... we're going to make Pints our new local kid!\" \n\n*Should I be worried that I talk to myself in the third person? Hells no, mind yer own business! :-D
