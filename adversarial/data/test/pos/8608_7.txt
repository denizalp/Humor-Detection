Ok, I quit after just 5 months. I am choosing not to look at it as a failure on my part but just that this wasn't the right place for me. The workouts are pretty intense and despite what they told me when I was being pressured to sign up, they really don't offer any individual attention or suggestions for modification. They expect everyone to be able to perform at the same level and that is just not realistic. I think this is a great option for someone who is already pretty fit but has reached a plateau and needs to up the intensity level. For someone like me who is pretty out of shape, it was almost counter productive. By that I mean that if you work out to your breaking point where you can't even breath then afterwards you are probably going to overeat and then the next day you will be so sore and stiff that you will avoid activity. I had previously been trying to build more activity into my daily life by taking the stairs, parking further away, walking at lunch, etc but while doing orange I couldn't do any of those things because I was so exhausted and sore and just wanted to crawl into a ball the day after a workout and the day before a workout I had such a horrible sense of dread. I just really hated going there. But hey, that's just me. I hate working out anyway. My new philosophy is to focus more on what I am eating and to find ways of working out that I actually enjoy so that I will stick with them and be more consistent.\n\nPros:\n\n+ This place made me realize just how out of shape I really am\n\n+ I learned to focus more on my heart rate during exercise (I have since done a metabolic test to find out what my actual target hear rate should be, something they don't do there at Orange Theory).\n\n+ I learned I need to incorporate strength training into my workouts.\n\nCons:\n\n+ Way too much pressure to sign up and they make it difficult to quit. Plus they continue to charge you for another month after you quit (this was definitely not what they told me when I signed up).\n\n+ Misleading information given about what is really involved in the program and they are not forthcoming about the different pricing options. They just steer everyone to the most expensive plan.\n\n+ Everything costs extra: strap for heart rate monitor, towels, weight loss contests.\n\n+ $10 fee if you miss class\n\nOh, wow, I can't believe I almost forgot to tell you about the $10 fee if you miss a class. This is the most ridiculous thing ever. I suppose you could look at it as an incentive but I mean sometimes you just don't have control over traffic, family, etc and you simply can't make it. So every time you don't go you have to pay ten bucks. That is just outrageous! Very, very devious business practice and completely unnecessary. There were plenty of times when the class was over filled but they found a way to make it work. And there were plenty of times when the class was totally empty and they still had class anyway.
