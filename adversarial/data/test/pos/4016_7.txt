Hello, my name is Faith, and I am a cupcakeholic.\n\nIt started at a very young age. Doctors and television shows would run warnings about cupcakes informing our parents that they should keep them away from us for our health. My parents were able to protect me for a while, that is, until I grew old enough to attend birthday parties on my own without their supervision (age 5). \n\nThe music blared, the party dresses swirled, the party favors circulated. At last, the platter of cupcakes arrived. Everyone was doing it, I would be left out if I did not join it... After all one wouldn't hurt right?\n\nAt first it was just a party thing. Birthday party= quick fix in the name of celebration. After a while, it became a morning thing to accompany my coffee. Then it spiraled into me eating them at home by myself. I knew I had hit a low when I began to replace meals with a cupcake.  \n\nOne night, as I tossed in bed with the idea of eating a cupcake. I gave in a grabbed a cupcake in the refrigerator and ate in on the kitchen floor. I knew I had hit rock bottom. \n\nAt 2:25am that night I made a decision. I would no longer be oblivious to any cupcake. I would use all of my cupcake craving energy on ONE cupcake a week. As a cupcakeholic, that is a massive amount of energy to put into one cupcake.\n\nIt was hard at first, but slowly I progressed with the support of family and friends who had gone through similar issues in the past.\n\nThat ONE weekly cupcake is often one from this delicious (and cute) little bakery called Urban Cookie. Is it worth skipping mediocre cupcakes throughout the week for ONE cupcake? \n\nThe answer is YES. I only go for the good ish now, and when it comes to cupcakes this place hits the spot!\n\nGo Urban Cookie! :)
