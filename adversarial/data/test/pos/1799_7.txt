I love this place we get our essential oils here, there prices are good,, and had labels done , although it took longer than it was suppose to they really came out nice for our ministries.\n\nBe kind to them and im sure they will do there best to get the order placed and properly sent to us..Patience is a virtue..and learned wisdom.
