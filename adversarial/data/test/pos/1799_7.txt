I wanted to find a good soul food restaurant while here in Phoenix. Being from the east coast, I'm use to a certain type of soul food restaurants. First, I prefer my sandwich on sliced bread and not a bun and I expected two pieces of fish for a sandwich versus one piece received. The mac & cheese i'm sure is prepared either daily (at least I hope) or it was from the day before, very average. I ate one of the onion rings, cause I had enough of the fried food taste from the fish. \nBe prepared to wait upwards of 15mins for your ordered main dish, cause again the sides are pre made and sitting in a warming container. I'm still looking for a good soul food spot.
