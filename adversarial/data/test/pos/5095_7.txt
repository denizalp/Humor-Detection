This location has a walk-up window, as well as a drive-through!  I usually drink at local coffee shops while in the valley, so I am not aware of current layouts of chain coffeeshops...  Pretty cool.  \n\nA coworker\/friend gave me a Starbucks gift card (don't forget to register it online to collect perks!), so I decided to grab a tall (12 oz.) cup of brewed coffee on my way to visit nearby Zak's Chocolates.  I didn't have to wait at all, as a barista approached me as soon as I mustered \"hello.\"  Friendly service with a smile!\n\nWouldn't mind returning, as long as I have gift cards to use.  :)
