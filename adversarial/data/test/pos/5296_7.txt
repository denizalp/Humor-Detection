I used to come to Poke Express when they were a part of another restaurant on Eastern, and I may or may not have hyperventilated for a hot second when I found out they moved within 5 minutes driving distance from my home.\n\nIn my opinion, I prefer Poke Express over the many poke joints in Vegas. I feel like the quality, flavor, and price of their fish is on point, and I feel like I get my money's worth every time I come. \n\nThey sell fish by the pound, and I usually grab 2 different kinds of fish (1\/2 containers each) with a scoop or two of furikake rice. My go-tos are the salmon with shoyu sauce and the ahi tuna because they are so flavorful and fresh. The seasoning doesn't completely overpower the fish like some other poke places, so I'm all for it.\n\nWhen I'm feeling zesty, I also get the tako kimchi to give my lunch\/dinner a little more heat and texture. The kimchi is slightly sweet and the spiciness isn't too much, so it's doable for those of you who want some heat but not something that makes you run for milk or water.\n\nThere aren't tables to sit, so it's more of a to-go restaurant. It's not a huge deal for me because I live so close, but even if it were hypothetically further away, I'd probably still swing by, order some salmon, and eat it in my car. It's that good, my friends.\n\nIf you haven't tried Poke Express, you definitely should check it out sometime. It's my favorite poke restaurant in Vegas and the flavor combinations\/marinades are amazing.
