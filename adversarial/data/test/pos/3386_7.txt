Cool theme with music along the route, but organization and execution of the start and finish are inconsistent, and sometimes very frustrating.  The end location needs better access to key roads for ability to move people out of the area, and parking in downtown Tempe is becoming quite a chore.  Traffic is bad, which makes getting there and going home quite painful.
