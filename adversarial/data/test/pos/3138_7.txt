Taco Tuesday ha ha!\nWent bout noon and purchased 5 tacos. ($5.33)\nDried out taco shell, non-descript meat, \nordered beef but I think they mixed chicken in there too. A few strands of lettuce and cheese and cold to boot! Dam\nCalled and spoke with Marlene (mgr) and she would replace the tacos free of charge on my next visit. Not going back!
