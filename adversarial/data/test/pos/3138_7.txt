The hotel bar where everybody knows your... face. \n\nThe Omni Mont Royal is my hotel of choice when in town and after my last visit, I realized that Alice Bar is often my bar of choice, too. The bartender\/server that I always see remembers me each time (he's been working there for a long time) and always has good conversation (or leaves me alone if I'm having a work night with my lap top). The seating is a good combination of lounges, chairs and tables and unless there's some annoying group function happening, you are always well accommodated here. The wine list offers up a decent Italian red by the glass, so I'm always happy. Prices... well, it's a higher end hotel bar, so don't expect bargains or happy hours.\n\nIt's my ideal kind of hotel bar because I know that if I'm out and about and places are extremely packed with people when I just want peace, quiet and good vino, I have refuge.
