Went here for the second time because the first was so great!!\n\nOnce again we both got burgers. This time I tried the turkey burger with onion rings on it. It was delicious!!! We got the green bean and sweet potato fries again because they were so good last time. We also tried zucchini fries this time and they were good! I would say the green bean fries are still my favorite though. \n\nWe really enjoy the food here. The only downfall seems to be the slow business. Both times we have gone it has been pretty empty in there. It would be more enjoyable to go if it was more upbeat and busy in there.
