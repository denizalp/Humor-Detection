It's twofer Friday in the review column (I know, it should be 2-fer Tuesday, but that's just not how things worked out).\nAfter lunch at Stax, my daughter and I took a short stroll down Scottsdale Rd. to the G-spot. I have had coffee there in the morning few times, but I had not been in the mood for gelato at 7:10 am, while walking our pup.\nSo today, in spite of the freezing temperatures outside, we had a gelato.\nReally good gelato! These guys are the real deal and the gelato is, I think, comparable to pretty much anything you'll find in Italy. I'm pretty pedestrian, and to me it's almost impossible to beat good old vanilla bean (I did taste the strawberry, too, and it was also delightful). The gelato was smooth and creamy, not too sweet, just great stuff!\nWhitney, my daughter had something chocolate and italian, which, try as I might, I can't remember the name of. She has more gelato experience than I do, and also thought hers was great.\nSo, why 4 stars instead of 5? The 2 people (kids?) behind the counter. They could barely be bothered to respond to us, and appeared to very clearly not want to be there. I wouldn't go so far as to say the service was bad, but when I say \"thank you\" to someone or ask a question, I would like to get a response.\nSo good coffee and gelato, with a little attitude on the side, at the G-Spot.
