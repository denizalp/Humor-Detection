By far the best Cirque De Solei production show I have ever seen. Not only am I a Cirque fan, I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan so my expectations were pretty high. My husband and I enjoyed it from the beginning to the last. \n\nThe last piece was my favorite part, It was amazing, I wanted to cry. \n\nMichael Jackson's 'The One' was a standing ovation. I would love to see it again because there were so many things going on at the same time, I didn't know where to look. Gah! I loved it so much.
