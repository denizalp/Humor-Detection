I need to go back and I'm liable to up my review to 4 stars. I mean really: chilaquiles so close to home?!? They were delicious the first time but it's been a couple months - I need to get back there. \n\nHere's the deal: this restaurant used to be on Central Ave. just north of Hatcher (http:\/\/www.azcentral.com\/ent\/dining\/articles\/0911mexdiningcheap.html) and they've moved to the Let It Roll bowling alley. As a consequence (I'm guessing) they were asked to have bowler-friendly foods like pizza, hot dogs and hamburgers. So, you'll find those on the menu.\n\nYou'll also find the traditional Oaxacan food (and a mini version of the mini-mart) from the previous location.
