If we overlook the fact that the restaurant wrote down our reservation for 10 for the wrong night, my group's dining experience here was exceptional and we were pleased that they were still able to seat us despite this error. The service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. The flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. Since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. Damn you Nobu for being so expensive! Otherwise I would have ordered 2 of everything!\n\nA couple of dishes I would recommend trying are:\n-yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno\n-toro tartar with caviar\n-black cod with miso\n-rock shrimp tempura\n-new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce\n\n***The MUST try dish is the FISH\/LOBSTER TACOS!!!***\nThey are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are AWESOME. I have pictures to prove it.
