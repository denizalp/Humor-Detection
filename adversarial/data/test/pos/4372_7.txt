I wasn't going to leave a review at first, but it's been a couple of weeks and I still hate my hair. How on earth it is supposed to be thought of as a good job by the stylist who did it is insane, I should have known by her blah-zay attitude. The front desk's customer service left a little to be desired as well. Super bummed, I miss the cut I had before even though my ends were fried :(
