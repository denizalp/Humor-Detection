Out here this week for another family gathering. My family decided to try this place out again. This time was fair.\n\nLet's say they have been open over a year an they still use a banner sign in front of the business. We were hoping for more decor improvements to represent Guam. Inside was much better made us feel like everything from back home was represented well. \nBut all the other business around have nice outdoor sign of business logo & name. I think they should invest in a nice red rice sign outside like the other business around them.\n\nThe wait for a to go call still took 25-30 minutes we called in the worker who answered said 15-20 but when we got there took another 10-15 minutes so total of 1\/2 an hour. Food was cold so we microwaved our food. \n\nI ordered the chicken plate again it was better this time not as dry & more flavor still char broiled but that was ok. I still can taste the other meats that they must cook their meats on the same grill or use the same utensils because I can taste beef when I'm a chicken eater. The rice wasn't mushy this time it was bland but better not a wet & uncooked like last time. The cucumbers were a little soggy & bitter but it's probably was soaking to long I prefer my cucumbers crisp I know some Chamorros like it marinated longer so my cousin ate the rest of my cucumbers.\n\nMasubi was still not my cup of tea but it's so hyped up I had to try it again. I just can't really get the red rice & wrap but that's ok the kids liked it.\n\nWe tried their corn soup it was not thick a little runny but seasoned well just needed a little more corn starch to make it thick. \n\nEmpanadas hasn't changed the mushy no chicken still so I would have to say no to this.\n\nHad a little kelaguen I also would say needs just a little more lemon & pika. Can't taste the coconut. More like ceviche or sisig. LOL! \n\nLumpia still the same not a fan but kids enjoyed it. My husband had the beef plate he said a bit better this time around not a chewy & tough but wished they served it warmer or hot when plate came out.\n\nLatijas were good. Kids enjoyed .\n\nAll in all its continued progress & wish this business best of luck. The chamorro community is very big so you will always have critics. Keep up the good work! \n\nI want to give a 3-4 star but just a few more fixes then they will be there the tables weren't clean for us to wait on for our food so I went back outside to wait for our food. If dining area was clean it would of been better for us to wait in doors it was hot outside.
