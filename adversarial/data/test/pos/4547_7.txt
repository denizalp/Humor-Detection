We came in for lunch mid week. We didn't order any sushi, just a couple items off their a la carte menu. The Korean BBQ beef and a bento box with chicken teriyaki. The chicken is all dark meat which I personally think they should let us know. 95% of Japanese restaurants use white meat for their chicken teriyaki. The Korean BBQ beef was overly sweet and the beef texture was a little off. Like it was sitting in the marinade too long. The service was really slow because it was just one server for the entire place. We ended up paying 28 bucks for a cheaper cut of chicken and beef that sat in their marinade for a really long time.
