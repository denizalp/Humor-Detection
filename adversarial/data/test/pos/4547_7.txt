Horrible service. I went in with my husband to get a sundae and wanted to use a coupon for Father's Day weekend.  It clearly says for the weekend. When I went to use it is only valid Saturday and Sunday.  Really it is Friday night and you won't honor it. Their ice cream is not that good and there was maybe 3 people in the store.Customer service is something theu really need to work on.
