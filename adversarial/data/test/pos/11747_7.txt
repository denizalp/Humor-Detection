Morning Star Cafe...I Love This Place.\n\nThis is your typical, but not so typical Mom 'N' Pop Deli.  The food is always fresh and creative and the specials are top notch.  I have never had a bad experience or meal at Morning Star.  Each day they serve a different special and I suggest you try all of them.  My personal favorite is the Turkey Relleno Grilled Sandwich which is served on Tuesdays.\n\nThey do more than lunch too.  Their breakfast's are also very good (check out the pictures).\n\nThis is a small place located in an industrial area; so, don't be surprised by its location.  You can eat inside or out side at one of a few select tables.\n\nThis is a fun place to find and the food is well worth the adventure!
