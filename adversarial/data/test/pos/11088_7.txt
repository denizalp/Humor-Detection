It's too bad that all Kenneth Cole outlets are shutting down, both at this location and at the North outlet. Currently everything is 50-60% off. Some items are even on a closeout deal for like 75% off. They had a lot of nice work attire; slacks, tops, blazers, etc. Now with everything being on sale, I was able to find a dress for work that was roomy enough for my preggo tummy, a belt for my BF and a few plain scoop neck shirts without breaking the bank. All of it was around $80ish. Not bad given that the dress alone used to be $79. The store itself was still very well organized and fully stocked. Maybe when they increase the percentage off, then it'll get a bit messier. The employees had no personality and were just going through the motions, but you can't expect much since they are about to lose their jobs.  I'll be back again in the following weeks to see what else I can score for super cheap.
