This is a child's paradise and a parent's affordable way to kill time on the weekend or during the weekday! The park is owned by the city of Scottsdale ad therefore they keep it very clean and well-kept. There are several acres of grass which offer the perfect spot to put down a blanket for a picnic and game of catch. If you'd rather sit at  table, the park offers plenty of picnic tables that make the perfect location for a birthday party BBQ. But that's typical of every park. What sets this park apart from the rest are the additional perks! \n\nFirst up, the train. My nephews love this park because they have a train ride that goes around the park. It's pretty cheesy for an adult but it's heaven for a four year old! After the train ride, check out the train depot with model trains on display! Once you're done, take a carousal ride for a couple dollars and end your afternoon with an ice cream cone from the ice cream shop and browse the toy section while you wait! This park is an affordable option for an activity with your little one that won't break your bank. However, I only advice those traveling with children in town to actually visit the train park. It might be a little juvenile if you're sans kid.  \n\n\nEvent note: check out the Christimas tree lighting ceremony, holiday activities and music in the park during spring time!
