This is the rotating restaurant on the 24th floor of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Phoenix. All the tables are on the outside and everyone can see the view. We were told it takes about 50 minutes to do a complete rotation.\n\nThe restaurant menu has a good selection with some high end selections as well as some more moderately priced options. I went with the Truffled mushroom bolognese and a small Southwest Caesar salad. The salad was tiny and what made it look even smaller was the large plate it was on. And the salad wasn't anything special except for being a little spicy. The pasta dish was good but not big on flavors. \n\nService was decent. Our waiter was a little too excitable and it got to be somewhat annoying at times but he was friendly and helpful with dinner selections.\n\nBut the best thing about this is the view so my suggestion is go for the view. I'm sure there's better food in Phoenix.
