Poor management!  This place only worries about turning tables.  My food was mediocre at best.  Lunch service was slow and they pushed to seat the patio at all costs.  It was 118 degrees the afternoon I was there.  I was with coworkers and the manager said it would be a 20 min wait for inside.  He knew we were on our lunch and although there were empty tables inside, he used our time constraint to his advantage.  We asked several times to be reseated inside,  but the evil manager wouldn't cave.  I will never go back. A coworker, one who I was with during my visit, was served raw hot wings at lunch yesterday.  He sent them back and to his surprise the waitress returns back from the kitchen and told him that the chef said they were not raw and would NOT redo the order.  Not wanting to eat raw chicken, he just told the waitress to forget it.  They did take it off his bill, but what a jerkface thing for the chef to do! Bad, bad, bad customer service.  Raw chicken is never ok......if your customer said its raw, redo it.  You are willing to kill someone over your pride?
