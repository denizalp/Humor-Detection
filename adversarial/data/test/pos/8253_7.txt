Love Love Love this place...... in a city that doesn't have much for kids to do, this is a Amazing Idea! The Decor is so adorable, the staff is Wonderful! They have a great selection of packages and al a cart items to fit anyones budget Big or small! I took my daughter and her friends here after her slumber party birthday and they had the time of their life! They get to feel like a little princess for sure! I'd recomend this idea for any little girls birthday party or just a special day out!!!! Perfect Idea!!! :)
