I've been going to Cluckers for years. Every time I'm back home in Charlotte I find myself here frequently.\nIt's a solid restaurant with good food. Best thing to do (when with friends) is order the family meal. You get salad, rice, fries, pita bread and loads of chicken. I leave stuffed and happy. Just be careful when adding coca-cola to the mix as you'll want to be near a toilet.\nI'll always remember going to Cluckers ages ago and changing the \"Welcome\" sign when you walked in. It took lots of careful effort and hard labor but after many visits we had successfully changed the sign from \"Welcome to Cluckers!\" to \"Welcome you F**kers!\"\nThey didn't notice for a week till someone complained.
