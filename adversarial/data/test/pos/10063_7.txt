3.5 star with room for improvement!\n\nOn a Sunday night when the Liberty Village is quiet like a ghost town.. I wonder around looking for RAAW.. Almost want to give up seems like everything were closed! But what I will do for my Sushi fix? Nothing can stop me.. the only thing I hope was that it still opened when I found it! \n\nRaaw from outside looked dark.. inside is dark too.. There were only another table aside from myself tonight.. \n\nReading through the menu, I found the price here seems reasonable for location inside Liberty Village \n\nChef's Sushi ($15) includes salad and Miso soup \n- The Salad was nicely presented in a bowl.. nice spring mix with different greens not just the lettuce, tomato and cucumber.. (+0.5 star) \n- The Miso soup though has good but was served lukewarm.. just like my waitress... \n- The nigiri sushi was a pleasant surprise! Good selections of fish, the cut was big.. (Salmon, Tuna, Shrimp, Octopus, Snapper, and even have my \"favourite\" Saba..) \n- The Maki rolls are both spicy.. tuna and salmon.. I love spicy rolls so I have no complain..but I wondering since it is the Chef's choice and what if someone doesn't eat spicy? \n\nSeriously this place really have to \"lightened\" up! Not it is so dark and hard to take good photos, and it is a good idea for us to really look and admire what we are eating before we put in our mouth.. that's the part of enjoying your food! \n\nThe staffs here all speak Cantonese.. even the Sushi Chef. The waitress though really courteous kept checking if my tea is filled and if I like my food, but she does sounded blunt.. smile and lightened up.. that will make a difference!
