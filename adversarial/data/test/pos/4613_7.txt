This place was actually better than I expected.  You should expect a long line to get in, or if you are lucky you can grab a seat at one of the bars inside.  I had a Euro burger, which I thought was great and plenty filling.  I skipped the fries and all the other bad stuff though, but they looked like they would have tasted good.  The service was good, but expect to wait a little bit for your food to come out.  Luckily they have a good drink\/beer list to try from.
