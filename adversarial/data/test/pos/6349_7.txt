We drove from Toronto to see a few Cleve attractions. This place was high on my list of must trys and it didn't disappoint.\nI would go to Cleveland again just for this food.\nThey should really just open up shop here in Toronto though.\nI should mention our server was great and helpful when we asked about other attraction in the Cleve. To be honest everyone we spoke to in Cleveland was nice, almost like we were still in Canada :)
