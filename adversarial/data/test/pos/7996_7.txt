Great seafood and you get a lot of it. The crab box and the lobster box are delicious. I also had a little of the crab and shrimp Alfredo, fresh and yummy. \n\nYou can order thru their website (sometimes) but if you go and pick up note that the parking is limited and it's not a fast food place so you will need to wait.
