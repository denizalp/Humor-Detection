This is a must visit Bakery. Located in the Smiths shopping center on Lake Mead and Rampart, The German Bakery is addicting. \n\nThe hubby is from Germany so when I found out about this little hidden gem i knew I had to surprise him with a treat. I ordered a Cherry Strudel, German Cheesecake, Nugat, and pretzel. Me being allergic to gluten unfortunately I was not able to try anything but he ate everything in 1 day. If i would have bought more he would have eaten that too haha.\n\nHe said everything was very traditional in German baking. Not too sweet like a lot of American bakeries. He even went back the next day... Ive created a monster!
