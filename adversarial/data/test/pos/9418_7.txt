Absolutely delicious. Both of us ordered the bunless burger (one well done and mine was medium rare) and we both loved it. It was seriously so good. One of the best burgers I've ever had. I was very impressed. Truffle fries eta also great! Cole slaw was a little over peppered, but it was ok. \n\nAlso, it is my birthday and the server gave us a very nice decorated cheesecake with a candle. It was very cute and delicious! Great service by everyone! \n\nThis place has a great ambiance, super fun vibe. We checked out the upstairs area because we are looking to host a private dinner for 20+ in a few months.
