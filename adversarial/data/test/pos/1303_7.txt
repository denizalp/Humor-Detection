This was called Bartolatta, when my husband and I came here. Exquisite menu options, and cocktails are incredible. Definitely pricey, but worth your time and money. Luxurious decor, impressive all the way around with magnificent views. \n\nWe are looking forward to our visit this September, and can't wait to explore the new menu options and will definitely take lots of pictures and will share with you guys our experience. \n\nI am sure it will not disappoint. Till then...
