Made the mistake of applying for a loan with these clowns in July 2015.  Their rate and fees were high, and when I tried to negotiate, they played the \"let me talk to my manager\" game.  Very unprofessional.  When the seller declined my offer on the first property, I chose another.  \n\nFirst I was told that I could continue the loan process and just substitute the new address for the old one.  A day later Caleb calls me back and says that I have to start all over (new application fee, new credit pull, the whole 9 yards).  \n\nMy gut told me to shop around, and I'm really glad I did.  I found a lender with much better service, and instead of bringing 11 grand to closing (as Quicken quoted me) I brought 3 grand.  FOR THE SAME LOAN.  \n\nAs part of the process, Quicken collected a $400 appraisal deposit from me.  No appraisal was ordered, YET THEY STILL WON'T RETURN MY DEPOSIT.  I'll never, EVER use this company again.
