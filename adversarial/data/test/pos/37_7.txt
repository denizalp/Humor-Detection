Went here for afternoon tea! Everything from the service and the food was amazing. Afternoon tea is only served from mon-fri which is a bummer because I'd like to go on the weekends. Must make a 24hr reservation. The portions were perfect!! We even had extra to take home. Our server even hooked us up and added more desserts to our to go box. That was really sweet of him. One of the best afternoon tea spots in town. Will def go back!
