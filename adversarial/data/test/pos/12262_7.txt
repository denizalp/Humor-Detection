Coming to this place reminded me of a reason why I even THOUGHT about changing my name to an \"American\" name.\n\nI was out for lunch with a few colleagues because this place has a special for my company and it's new so we decided to check this place out.\n\nThe cashier ask me for my name and here's how it went down:\nMe:  \"TRAM\".\nCashier, \"really?\"\nMe: \"yea\"\nCashier: \"How do you spell that?\"\nMe: \"T-R-A-M\"\nCashier: \"can you spell that again?\"\nMe: (louder) \"T-R-A-M\"\nCashier: \"REALLY? wow, T-R-A-M-P? like TRAMP?\"\nMe: \"HUH?!?!?\" (note: i don't really have that bad of an accent -if you're wondering)\nThis dialogue went on for a while so I decided to use my colleague's name for my take-out. \n\nI'm not mad btw but first impression- is hard to forget ;) - now here's the review.\n\nChicken breast Yaki Soba bowl: I did not enjoy it- my bowl of Yaki Soba had way too much sauce.  Good thing this location provide Sriracha rooster sauce so I can enjoy the chicken breast. phew.  My noodles= soggy.\n$8.65 with a 10% discount for a meal (came with a medium drink and an eggroll.\n\nTwo other colleagues had Yaki Soba as well and both of them said - \"Go easy on the sauce Samurai Sam's!\"\n\nOne persn had the Chicken Ceasar salad- he said it had too much dressing and the flavor was too strong (too  much vinegar).\n\nAnother of my colleagues had the chocolate banana smoothie from Frullati and he loved it! (a lot!) literally down the whole cup right when we step outside.\n\nI would highly reccommend everyone to try this place out because it is a nice place for the Buckeye area.  Don't expect too much but not a bad place to try- the manager there is very friendly as well.  Thumbs up!
