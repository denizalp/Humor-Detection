Return visit, five of us, Sunday night.\n\nSeated right on time, waiter comes to the table and that is nearly the last thing that went right, the whole night.\n\nHonestly, if you can't handle several tables, either get help or get out of the business.  It can be tough, I'll admit, but this guy forgot something on each of his dozen visits to the table.  \"Is everything still EXCELLENT?\" he asked.  Well... Four of us left food on our plates.  \"Can I get boxes for you?\"  Uh, no.  That's why it's still on the plate.  They've been open for two-thirds of a year, now.  Place is packed, so there's no reason, really, for them to improve the service or the food.  Except.  There are many, many better places, some not that far away.  I'm still kinda pulling for them; maybe they'll work on bettering the experience out of professional pride.  Or something.  (They could, and really SHOULD, be a great restaurant.  Good location, some buzz... I wonder if they will.)\n\nI won't repeat my diatribe against the silly and thoroughly unnecessary valet parking, but will offer this valuable lesson.  After we got the car and handed over the tip, I spied someone cutting into the south driveway.  I'm not sure we'll ever return, but if we do, I'll park on the south side and just hand the guy my tip on the way in.  It will save ten minutes, easy, and everyone's happy.
