At first walking in it looks like a fancy place but when you get the bill for the cigars and drinks you have heart failure.\nNobody is ever in there not sure how they're staying open.\nSaw the Sign outside and it looks more like a cheesy Disco club from the seventies sign then a cigar bar sign. Just an awful design\nIll never go back I never got a good vibe from this place from the beginning.\nThere's so many other much better cigar bars in the Phoenix area the beat this place all day long\nAnd the cigar selection is extremely poor.\nExtremely high cigar prices
