This place is inside Greenland supermarket food court. \n\nWe ordered ramen, Yu gae jang (spicy soup) and Korean sausage with intestines. They were all good. I like the Korean sausage especially. They were soft and tasty. It's an acquired taste. Don't expect to like them instantly. \n\nThe wait for the food was about 20 minutes or so. I'm guessing it's not pre made. The price is affordable. It was $7 or $8. After you're done, take your tray to the back. It's a good gesture to tip the man clearing all the dishes too. It's optional.
