Have been a member of la fitness for quite some time now and then a flyer arrives in our mailbox from youfit. For only a flat fee of 115 bucks, I get a year membership. Way cheaper than my la fitness. And considering I don't take the classes or use the racquetball or basketball courts or the pool, I figured it might be worth checking out.\n\nYoufit is only weights and cardio. No classes. They have essentially everything I use at la fitness but cheaper. Youfits cardio equipment is a huge upgrade. They have a smaller locker room, don't open until 5am (I usually get started at 4:30am). Otherwise, I've been pleased with my first two visits there. Mornings are slow so I don't have to compete for equipment. And it lacks the combat boot wearing sleeveless hoodie skull cap wearing weight slamming muscle heads.
