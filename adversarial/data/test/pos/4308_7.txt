WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!\n\nMy bf and I decided to try this place bc we heard that it was amazing. But we should have never tried to find out. \n\n1) Quality of food was better than most other buffets but the selection not so much. And at $70\/person bc it was Easter weekend, it definitely wasn't worth it. \n2) Service HORRIBLE. Honestly the whole night was a bust. \n\n*First: We got to the restaurant at 5:30pm to avoid the lines. We paid and was then told to wait in another line to wait for the host to seat us. A girl took our receipt and told us they would seat us soon. At this point there were no other groups. Then 5 min later we are still waiting and other people started getting into the lines. The host sat 10 different groups before us when we were clearly there first. Only after I questioned them did they decide to seat us. Unbelieveable. \n\n*It was Easter weekend so even the AYCD prices were jacked up. $25\/person for a selection of mimosa, Bellini, champagne, red wine, white wine, couple beer selections. From my understanding we were allowed to switch off btw the drinks thruout the night. Even the cashier in the front told us this was the case bc my bf was contemplating btw getting wine vs beer. The cashier specifically told us we can start w white wine and change thruout the night. Once we got to our table and had our first glass of white wine I asked to change to red wine and our waitress told us that bc it's a holiday wkend that we can only stick with one thru out the night as she was told by her manager. And she even mentioned that normally you are able to switch drinks thruout the night (normal aycd price $15). So we asked to talk to her manager. The manager came by and pretty much told us we can only stick with one drink bc it's the holidays. That's all she was saying. I think as a person in the service department you need to handle things differently. First, there was clearly a miscommunication btw the Bacchanal staff. The cashier lady told us we can switch. If we were better informed we may have not purchased AYCD or we may have picked a drink to stick with thruout the night. Second, it doesn't make sense that you up charge your guests bc it's a holiday and then limit your selection to one drink thru out the night. Third, the manager wasn't willing to allow us to make different selections thru out the night nor offered a refund. She pretty much didn't offer any other alternatives when we as customers were misinformed and was not satisfied. She just looked annoyed more than anything. HORRIBLE SERVICE. My bf pretty much said let's make a deal. Let us switch to one other drink now that we are better informed. And she at the end complied with that with no apology or sorry on her end. \n\n*When we first ordered our white wines they were bringing them out 2 glasses at a time. When we changed it to red our waitress didn't even bring out another glass until our glasses were empty and not until I asked her to bring it... it took 30 min to get another glass. Ridiculous. \n\nFrom start to finish I was pissed off and unhappy with our dining experience. \n\nFor ~$100\/person I expected more. I would have much rather taken our money to a nice steakhouse and receive better food and service. And there are a lot of options in Vegas.
