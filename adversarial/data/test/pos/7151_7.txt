I reallyyyyy like this place! We had a catering order for a colleague's birthday last week, and it was fabulous! Everything came in boxed lunches with labels of each person's name, which everyone thought was great (considering every other food delivery comes in bags or a mess of plates). They have a wide variety of soups, sandwiches and salads - but, what I really loved was how different the selection was from your typical deli\/cafe. Example: Thai Peanut Sandwich.. where are you going to find that?!\n\nThe customer service was awesome. They were thorough and very fast with their delivery, and even called the next day to check and see how the food was. Everyone liked their food and we all decided we would definitely use them again for our next work lunch. Even if it's not for catering or delivery, you should try this place.
