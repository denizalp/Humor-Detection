Time to splurge and allow yourself to fall into a deep state of pleasure. \n\nAfter trials with off strip, inexpensive eats, we decided to make this meal a good one and it was definitely good alright. \n\nI don't usually give five stars, but I don't see what holds it back, so here it is. \n\nFirst, this place is pretty large and accommodates reservations pretty easily. I suppose it's not new and hot, so it's relatively simple to get a table during a desired time. \n\nWe had solid service. Everyone was so nice, even after we decline getting wine after many minutes of searching through the list and talking to a sommelier. Yep, we were those people. \n\nWe ordered: \nthe ribeye (25oz) which was split for us two\nthe wilted spinach salad\nbarbecue shrimp appetizer \nRoasted fingerling potatoes\nkey lime pie desert.\n\nThe wilted salad wasn't wilted bc we asked for the dressing on the side, but it was pretty good. I didn't love it bc of the bacon fat vinaigrette, but the fried egg was an interesting touch. The portion is quite small, so not really that shareable if you're wanting to get some greens in your diet. \n\nThe barbecue shrimp was fantastic. It comes at a hefty price of $18 for five shrimp, but it's pretty worth it. The shrimp were juicy and plump and very flavorful. It's more Cajun\/new orleans style, so don't think it's some traditional southern sweet BBQ. \n\nThe steak was delectable. It had a perfect crisp layer on the outside and a good medium rare redness on the inside. For the most part, it was really a good marbled piece of meat. Even at 12 oz each, I could barely finish it, but I was riding on the potatoes...\n\nWhich were pretty bomb too. Steeped with garlic and herbs and butter, these potatoes were cute and perfectly seasoned and cooked. Just soft enough to melt in your mouth but cooked enough to have some of a give when you take your initial bite. Definitely recommend these. \n\nAnd of course, seriously, the best is for last: the key lime pie. Trust me, I'm not a huge sweet tooth (even though I love love ice cream - it doesn't necessarily mean I love super sweet things!) and I don't often tend to like tart flavor profiles, but this was the damn best key lime pie I've ever had. We were recommended several things like the banana something something and blah blah blah and we both just happened to lock our eyes on the key lime - maybe we needed a refreshing dessert - but it was a good choice. By no means do I not think the others are good too - I bet they are - but this was the best choice for us! It was the right amount of tartness with the sweet (though it was a bit heavy on the sugar for my liking) and the strawberry glaze was so complementary. The crust was buttery and delicious and it all paired so well together! Goodness, the ghrelin hormones are starting to rise and they're making me hungry for this dessert! \n\nDelmonico's is a great steak place, maybe one of the best. Don't hesitate to come here for a satisfying carnivorous meal!
