Club Fetch is AMAZING! I am a total nutjob leaving my dog ANYWHERE and I have never felt better leaving him in the hands of the staff at Club Fetch. The staff was more than gracious in giving me a full tour and the facilities are EXCELLENT. They are so meticulous with any and all requests with regards to food, treats, toys, beds, and then playtime as well. I know that my little pup is so well taken care of when I leave him and has a great time. They also require a day of evaluation for dogs, so I know there are no dogs there that are not socialized in with my furbaby (seriously, I know, I have a problem.) The report cards at the end of the day help a ton, too, knowing that the staff took notice of how my dog did.\n\nThe location is great for me as well, and again, I cannot say enough about the amazing staff. Their Instagram\/Facebook feed with all the pictures also helps put my mind at ease while I'm away.\n\nWhether it's boarding or daycare you're after (the dogs play when they're boarding, it's all included) I don't think you will EVER find a place as great as Club Fetch.
