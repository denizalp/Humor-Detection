I was very excited to dine at E by Jose Andres. A few of my friends ate there a couple weeks prior and they really enjoyed their experience. I was anticipating this meal weeks prior. In order to get reservations you need to send an email (reserve@ebyjoseandres.com) up to 1 month in advance. They only serve 8 people per seating and have only 2 seatings per night (5:30pm and 8:30pm).  About a week prior you should receive your golden tickets for entry to the \"show\". Trust me ,it won't disappoint!\n\nThe staff is extremely friendly and well trained. On arrival we were quickly greeted at the entry of Jaleo restaurant. The host, Stephanie, explained the drink options, and left us while we went through the wine menu ( on an iPad). Once our drinks were ordered, she escorted us to a private room where a semi circle table of 8 seats is located. During the meal you enjoy watching the Chefs plate your meal! This is quite an experience, especially because they use many Molecular Gastronomic techniques. The chefs are very precise and meticulous with every dish. In additional to the chef there are 2 additional servers who take care of removing plates after every dish, refilling water, and switching out wine glasses. Service is excellent! Everyone is very attentive and knowledgeable about the cooking methods and wine pairings. There were so many tidbits that I cannot possibly remember everything they told me.\n\nWhile dining I definitely suggest you try on of the paring options. They have a non-alcoholic pairing ($55) and a traditional wine pairing ($110). Both are very interesting. My mom get the non-alcoholic parings and they very cool. Many of the drinks try to mimic actual alcoholic drinks! I personally ordered the regular wine pairings and though it was a amazing. My favorite was drinking out of a porron (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Porron), which was definitely a unique experience. Even if you choose not to do the wine pairings, don't worry a couple drinks are included in the meal. In fact, everyone got two gin and tonic drinks which were prepared very differently.\n\nThe food was amazing. Overall there were 20+ dishes. I'd have to say everything was very good. A few of my favorites were the lobster, the iberico ham and the mushrooms in cream sauce. While the food tasted very good, a HUGE part of the experience is enjoying the plating and unique cooking methods. The chefs are very talented and are familiar with cooking methods which are not traditionally taught at culinary school. One of the chefs, Mia, even said that she has learned cooking methods at E which were not taught at the Culinary Institue of America. One of my favorite methods was Spherification (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spherification), in which the use a calcium and an alginate bath to form spheres from liquids. These liquid spheres resemble caviar, but are filled with a flavorful burst when eaten. It is techniques like this that make this a truly memorable experience.\n\nE is one of my top dining experiences. I'd say overall I enjoyed the food at French Laundry more, but the show at E is like no other. Alinea uses some similar cooking techniques, however at E you get to enjoy watching the chefs preform the art of plating!
