I have been into this little coffee shop twice now and both experiences have been great. I love the vibe of the coffee shop and it actually has really comfortable furniture if you are looking to get some studying or reading done. My last visit I got their Pumpkin Spiced Latte and dang that was flavorful. My wife got their iced chai latte with their homemade almond milk and that was really good too! This spot is a little far from where I live but if I lived closer this would be my go-to coffee spot.
