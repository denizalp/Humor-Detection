Very friendly service but that's about it.  They clearly have no idea what they are doing...from the servers, to the bartenders, to the chefs....it was a debacle from start to finish.  How does prime real estate at one of the nicest casinos in vegas survive such utter incompetence.  They screwed up pretty much everything we ordered..mojitos without muddled mint, overcooked mussels, a souffle left in the oven about 20 min too long, the bussers couldn't figure out how to light the fondue.  Total nincompoopery from start to finish.   \n\nThe only thing keeping them from receiving a single star is they were so nice.  But nice only gets you so far.
