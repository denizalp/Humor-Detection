I love the whole idea gyu kaku has, the cook your own meats but the meats are also a lot better quality than most Korean BBQ around in Vegas. In fact I think this is the only Japanese BBQ and the pricing id say is $-$$ so not bad!\nAround 11 pm - close you best go in for their happy hour! A lot of the stuff is way cheaper and you can get way more appetizers or you can choose the combos where they come with all these picked meats for certain pricing. I love the ambience you never feel rushed to eat, but sometimes you feel the service is slow too. The customer service though has always been good everytime I eat here and at least they check up on us occasionally. I think the fact you take time to cook your food is what fills you up quicker. My favorite meats are the filet mignon, the Cajun shrimp, the butterfish, and the salmon (fish person much? I know lol.) anyways if you want dessert they also have macaron ice cream sandwiches! They're so cute haha and there's like 4 different flavors. I'd say you'd best take your date here or double date! It's the perfect place to go!
