Let me preface by stating outright:  I'm qualified to review this eatery based solely on its frozen desserts.  It has recently added paninis and soups that I haven't yet tried.\n\nBased on the sweets though, I am a huge fan.  The lemon-mint gelato is DEEE-vine!!!  Tart enough to make ya pucker!  Over the summer, Sweat Creamery had such flavours as \"spicy chocolate\"...with a big fat red pepper lying on top of the barrel.  The plain chocolate gelato has an incredibly rich, full-bodied chocolate flavour that I've rarely tasted before.  Total, super, hyper-real chocolate.\n\nThis is a total asset to the neighbourhood, and I wish it every success.\n\nMy only beef about this place is the chairs.  They have to be the most uncomfortable, cold (aluminum in winter ain't good) seats I've ever filled with my ample bottom.
