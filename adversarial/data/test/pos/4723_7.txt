Neat little resto tucked in the Petite-Patrie area near Beaubien station.\n\nWalked into the door with the open kitchen at the front and a face full of delicious smells. There was a bit of a wait, it took no longer than 10 minutes and the host\/server offered us a drink and even stools to sit on while we waited. I dig the interior design a lot, with it's lightbulb-lit lightning shaped sign, the lovely turquoise accent wall at the rear and the subtle homages to \"Santa Barbara\" (who I couldn't resist looking up and apparently is the patron saint of artillerymen, military engineers, miners and ppl who work with explosives). Also they give away buttons! I love buttons. Anyplace I get buttons is already a step ahead.\n\nThe menu is meatlover and vegetarian friendly and reasonably priced, they also have some delicious beer\/wine choices on their list. We ordered an appetizer of cornbread, hummus, homemade salsa and walnuts to start. I had the special which was sweet potato au gratin with a side of kai-lan (chinese broccoli). It was incredible... and perfectly balanced the sweetness of the potato with the baked cheese topping. My friend had the gnocchi dish, made with the larger sized gnocchi \"dumpling\" bits and was also very good. Neither of us could finish our plates or had room for dessert. I did top it off with a tasty espresso though... mostly to avoid falling asleep on the way home due to my full belly.\n\nSlight downside for me was that the seating is cozy. As in you may accidentally play footsie with your neighbour cozy. And if you get seated at a table bench-side mid row... good luck taking a pee break without ducking under the table or knocking a wineglass over with your badonkadonk while trying to delicately squeeze between tables (that may or may not have happened to me). This is probably not as much of an issue when they aren't quite as busy.\n\nI would definitely come here more often if it wasn't on the complete opposite end of the city from where I live. That being said, it is worth the trek so I'll be returning for more mouthgasms eventually.
