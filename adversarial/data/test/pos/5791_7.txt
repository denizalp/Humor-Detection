I'm writing this as I sit at the bar . We have come here several times and never experienced  the Wrath that is angry girl bartender Sonia. She's a red head, in her 20's and does indeed have teeth.... surprisingly enough when she smiles at the customers she actually chooses to like.\n\nNot sure what the beef is today except that we moved from a high top table to the bar within 10 minutes of our visit. We came here to pig out and watch the game,( Go Cards) but after we moved to the bar we were ignored! What's the deal.... .? I'm a former waitress, bartender, worked in the industry for more years than I can count and as far as I'm aware servers tip out the bar. So Sonia what is the deal?, why are we ignored, disregarded, shot evil girl looks in our direction, left with empty water, dirty plates, etc.... You're behaving in a non professional way and as though we did something personal we're not aware of. Did we steal your first boyfriend? WhAt is the deal?\n\n\nWe had to speak to the manager, Peter who addressed our concerns whole heartedly and remedied the situation and addressed our concerns.\n\nSo in summation: Sonia needs a hug. We like to pig out and watch football. We leave 20% when we receive service. Peter the manager is nice. the food at Kona is good. There's no \"I\" in team... Sonia I'm talking to you!\n\nThe End.
