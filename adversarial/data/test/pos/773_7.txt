The worst. Ever.\n\nUpon arriving in Vegas, we had no issue with Bell Trans and they got us to our hotel safely and promptly. \n\nHowever, as required, we scheduled our pickup at the hotel 24 hours in advance. We were outside our hotel 10 minutes prior to pickup, as instructed. The shuttle finally came 30+ minutes late. We tried calling twice in the meantime but could not reach anyone in their office. The bus was old and dirty.\n\nWe politely asked the driver how many stops he was making, because we were now in a time crunch due to them being so late with the pickup. He started screaming at us and calling us childish for asking a simple question. He then tried to kick us off the bus for daring to ask him a question. \n\nIt was simply, the most inappropriate, rude, and out of line customer service experience of my life. We finally got to the airport an hour after our supposed pickup time and then barely made our flight because of this nonsense.\n\nLuckily, we were able to secure a refund through our travel agency. There is no way I would ever give this company a penny after such disrespect, so at least we didn't waste any money on this garbage. I can't emphasize enough how badly we were treated. \n\nBelieve all of the negative reviews. You're better off walking to the airport.
