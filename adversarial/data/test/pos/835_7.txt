The taco stand here has leveled up, and is now a full blown trailer!  I don't know if it means different owners, but the menu looked a bit different from when it was just a stand.  The meats also tasted a bit different; when it was a stand I really liked the pastor.  Currently their cabeza is my favorite meat.\n\nTacos are around $1.50 each, orders are served up fast, and there is a full salsa bar.  There are no tables or areas for seating, so you'll be eating outside or in your car.  The only frustrating thing about this place is that the hours don't seem to be consistent.  I've driven past on Friday or Saturday nights expecting them to be open, but either they haven't set up yet or they have already closed.  Still, this is one of the better taco stops that I've had in this part of town.
