One of the kid's favorite things to do on the strip!  A perfect night out for them would be the roller coaster, video games in the attached arcade, dinner at Shake Shack and then dancing on the \"Brooklyn Bridge.\"  I usually skip the roller coaster (let's face it, I\"m too old), but will sit and wait from them right outside the entrance.  It's not a long wait and everyone is happy afterwards.
