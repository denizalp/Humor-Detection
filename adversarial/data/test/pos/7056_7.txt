[LOCATION] - 2\/5\nThis place is located on Main Street Unionville and Highway 7. There were limited parking spots in the plaza during peak hours. \n\n[SERVICE] - 0\/5\nWorst. Service. Experience. Ever. The lady who works here was grouchy (I came here 3 times and she was not friendly during any of those visits). It got to a point where her grouchiness made me feel uncomfortable, rubbed off on me, and I also made me angry for no good reason.\n\n[DÃ‰COR] - 2\/5 \nAverage Subway location. Seating area was quite small. \n\n[QUALITY] - 3\/5\nAverage quality for a Subway location. \n\n[ORDER] - 3\/5\n6'' Sub of the Day - $3.97 (after taxes) - I got the tuna sub and it tasted okay. I always get the same toppings & sauce & it tasted like a standard sandwich from Subway. \n\n[OVERALL] - 1\/5\nMy service experience was horrible. Even though it's a walk-able distance from my workplace, I would never come back to this location. I would rather drive a little further to another Subway location.
