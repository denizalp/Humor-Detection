The best word I can use to describe FABO is eclectic.  Sitting at the end of a first floor condo area at the edge of Myers Park, one of Charlotte's old money neighborhoods, you'd never expect to find such a gem inside.  \n\nAs you walk in you see art everywhere and it is local art.  There are seating areas in little \"galleries\" to allow people to have privacy.  Some areas have tables for working and others are a little more intimate with more comfortable seating.\n\nAt the counter, you can order coffee, tea, wine of small plates like a cheese plate.  There are also a wide variety of baked goods available.\n\nThe staff is friendly here and very helpful.  This is definitely a place I need to come back to ...especially since their specialty drinks are affordable!\n\nOh, one geeky thing...I love the lights above the counter.  They remind me of something you'd see way back when well before I was born.  lol
