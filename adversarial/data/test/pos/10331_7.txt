***I have had luck gambling here, but the casino is not that nice and pretty smoky***\n\nI have gambled twice at Harrah's and have won both times.  On this recent visit on a Friday night, they had $10 minimum tables, which definitely makes this an okay gaming option.  The negative is that Harrah's seems to be one of the smokier casinos on The Strip. \n\nFor parking, I believe they have complimentary valet or self-parking.
