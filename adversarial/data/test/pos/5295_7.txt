I've just finished my fourth visit to Thai Royal Massage at the Scottsdale (on Miller) location, and I will definitely be back many more times....my therapist is Mint (yes, her name is Mint!) and although she speaks little English, she is very skilled and is already knowledgable about my pain threshold (the pain is from an injury that the Thai massage has helped me to recover from far more than the physical therapy I was previously doing).  Thai massage is very therapeutic if you have lingering injuries.\n\nFor newbies:\nSome people refer to it as \"passive yoga\" and it is that, but much more - it's a combination of deep tissue\/pressure point massage and stretching, pushing, pulling, and twisting movements to release tension and increase flexibility.\n\nAs others have mentioned, this therapy is done with clothes ON - I wear stretchy yoga pants and a light tank top, but they do have loose clothing available for you to wear if you're coming from work.....they're like 'scrubs' that doctors and nurses wear.\n\nThere's a lot more touching involved as they will literally crawl on you (using their elbows and knees to knead and massage your large muscles), and use their feet as well in the pulling and pushing for better leverage - don't worry, you let them know ahead of time how much pressure you can handle, and let them know during if anything even starts to get to be too much.\n\nThe girl who works at the front desk (who has been there every time I've been in) is very friendly and professional, and their prices are very reasonable.  I definitely recommend Thai Royal Massage.
