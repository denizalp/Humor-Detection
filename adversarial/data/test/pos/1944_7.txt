I wish I liked hotdogs. \n\nGreat new place in the hood. The folks working here are great!\n\nI got the Chicken Parm sandwich which is huge and slathered in cheese. It comes with a side order choice between some salad choices and or house chips.  I ordered their house made chips which were okay. I do preface that though because I am very spoiled after eating the chips at  Market by Jennifer's. Those chips spoil you to all others. Lol \n\nIf you are form Upstate Ny stop by the digs are cool. \n\nThe prices are a bit spendy though. I will say I got two and I could have gotten three meals out of my sandwich.
