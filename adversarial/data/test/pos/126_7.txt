I can't believe I've never written a review for this restaurant! I've been here maybe 3 times and loved my experience each time. Is it far from me? Yes. Is it usually winter that I go for MTL a Table or for PoutineWeek? Yes. But it's so good. I've tried many things, from the lobster mac n cheese poutine to the salmon tartare and desserts, all is delicious from what I can remember.
