Stayed 3 nights with wife - fantastic.  Upgraded to panoramic suite at checkin for $20 xtra per night.  Downtown view - room was silent.\n\nDecor understated.  Bed cozy.  View beautiful.  Bathroom great.\n\nAmazing how I never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator.\n\nWe brought an electric kettle and a pourover for in room coffee and tea - i hate waiting and hate paying $30 for coffee - save your $$ for spa!!!\n\nWent to fitness center everyday, then re-upped calories at buffet.  Then 3 hours in spa, and then started carousing resort about 3:30, early dinner, show, gamble \/ clubs \/ late dinner.  Time with wife, no kids.\n\nRest, repeat.  Bliss.
