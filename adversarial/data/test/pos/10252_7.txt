Where can you wait an hour for bad over-priced food while watching a pregnant woman chain smoke and drink 2-3 beers?  Welcome to Burgh's.\n\nThere has always been something magical about this specific location.  I remember back in the days when this was the site of the Galaxy theater, where I got to watch ET and First Blood Part 2 in a double feature (back in the 80s).\n\nBurgh's somehow lacks the class of the Galaxy theater.  But you can expect a bad pizza bar for lunch, fantastic deep fried pretzels with the world's best honey-mustard, a nice selection of beers (hurray for the Belgian revolution), and some townie sight-seeing.\n\nI feel at home already.
