Best crepes in town. I came at an off time so the there was no wait! However the line gets long during peak eating times.\n\nYou walk up and order then you can watch them make it in front of you. Crepes are made to order. They have a menu of several savory and several sweet dessert crepes to choose from. \n\nI got the crepe with shrimp, spinach and wild mushrooms with a herb butter sauce. It was delicious! The crepe is cooked perfectly then all the goodies are added. I have had the ham and cheese one in the past and it's very good too. \n\nI have tried several of the dessert crepes in the past as well. I like them all. My only complaint is they do not use fresh berries if you order them, and can be overly sweet. They also do not use real whipped cream, but cool whip instead. I would be back here more often if they switched to real whipped cream. \n\nI still think they are the best in town. I will be back!
