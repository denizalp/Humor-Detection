That is what i think of their service! Its like OMFG. \n\nI came in da morning to drop off my scooter for some simple adjustments. I called a few day b4 and made appointment for 8:30am but i been told to be there 8 and they will write me up and send me on my way. So, there i am and they like - we not open till 8:30. Butttt. buttt Alright we will do you favor and write you up. \nI call for update about 1pm. Oh yeah its TWO hours worth of labor. WTF! two hours? I been told its one. Ok fine. \nI call for update at 3:40 and they JUST putting it on the lift and maybe i can come get it tomorrow? WTF, its my ride home. No, fucking do it today. Actually you know - Do not touch it. I called other dealers and they told me its actually only 30 min of labor not TWO hours. \nBottom line - Procrastinators and upchargers. Take you Harley elsewhere.
