ANOTHER place in Pittsburgh with about 2-3 more stars than it deserves! \nThis is definitely the only city I've lived in where I consistently have to think to myself: YELP rating - (1 if 'american' food) = actual rating or YELP rating - (2 to 3 stars if 'ethnic dining) = actual rating.....\n\nHere's my money-saving tip: rather than coming here and getting the pan-fried noodles, pour a little bit of salt water over some top ramen without adding the flavoring packet. It'll save you time and $7. Eating here was what made my boyfriend and I vow to start grocery shopping more and cooking our own food. I am after all, pretty good at making flavorless mush. Plus at home, I can beg someone to eventually refill my water.\n\nCaveat: If I were a college kid who was from a small farming town, had never had Asian food or been to a Noodles & Co. I might really like this place...that is, until after freshman orientation week, when I would be more likely and willing to leave campus, at which point I would discover Tram's. Go to Tram's for Vietnamese or Smiling Banana Leaf for Thai.
