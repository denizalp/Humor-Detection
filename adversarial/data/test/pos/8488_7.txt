I am fan of Atomic fo sho; it's my favourite Vietnamese sub spot in Calgary.  \n\nMy favourite is the veggie sub with extra cilantro, though I've had the wasabi tuna sub and the sweet chicken one as well & both were very good.  My husband loves the beef satay sub and - wait for it - the vegetarian sub!  He's no vegetarian, so this is shocking news.\n\nI often crave Atomic for lunch & am grateful to be within walking distance from work.  Yum yum, subs in my tum!
