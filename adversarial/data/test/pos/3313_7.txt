We (my uberyelper husband Jim W and I) ate dinner here, long ago, with fellow yelpers Heather and Ryan C. (I am truly remiss in my review writing, it seems). I'm giving them four stars but it's not an easy four. In fact, I think they're benefiting from the quality of the company. We had a great time. We always have a great time with these particular yelpers. So in some ways that benefits the restaurant because we're already happy. But I digress.\n\nWe all agreed that dessert was the high point of the meal. Their tiramisu makes my top five list of best tiramisu(s) ever. Dinner wasn't as big a hit. Chicken parm, one of my favorite things ever, was merely average. Though I can't remember what everyone else ordered, average seemed to be the feeling all around.\n\nThe place was lovely and the service was good. I doubt we'll go there again because we moved to LA in the time it took me to get to this particular review. But if Heather and Ryan want to meet there for dessert I might just make the drive.
