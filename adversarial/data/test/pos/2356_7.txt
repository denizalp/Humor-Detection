This is hands down one of the biggest Asian markets in the Charlotte area offering a wide variety of Asian goods as well as some European\/Russian, Spanish and Jamaican. \n\nThey have a wide variety of fruits and veggies and the herbs here are priced very affordably. I love stocking up on all herbs here and they come packaged in a variety of sizes, so I am not stuck buying a bunch at one time.\n\nThe seafood section while small is one of the better ones in town for the Asian market scene. They tend to have great pricing on selected items and I have been able to have a seafood feast while not spending an enormous amount of money.\n\nThe Filipino section here kicks rocks but they do have a lot to make up for it. Like Fresh Kimchi. And on my two most recent trips I was able to get green baby mangos which I love so much. So the availability of goods and products here other never cease to amaze me.
