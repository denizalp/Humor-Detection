Got through with a double bladed immersion blender, 16oz of unidentified hair paste, an aresol can and a pair of scissors.  Agent was rude and miserable not to mention poorly educated.  Girlfriend traveling with me had a 2.5oz jar of wildflower honey removed from her.  Thank Christ... I now know the plane won't be hijacked by any honey jars.
