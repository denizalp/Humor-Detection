\"Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\n\nObviously my husband and I are insane. \n\nOur first trip to the Robinson Levin Furniture was instigated by a need for a new couch and then fueled by their credit card. Credit leading us to bad choices again... \n\nWe purchased a couch and a recliner during this trip, as well as the warranty that \"covers everything including cat scratches!\". Great! We have cats with claws! Yay for warranties!\n\nFast-forward 1 year and we have a couch with a spring sticking out the bottom as one of the seats decided to fall through. We call up Levin and get told that our warranty doesn't cover any furniture craftsmanship issues. Lies, I think! I was told that it covers \"everything!\". So we go to the store and straight to the customer service desk. We explain that we were told this warranty covers \"everything!\". The customer service person says \"oh, sorry (not sorry). the warranty only covers fabric. but here's some third-party repair guy I'll scribble on a piece of paper that you can pay to fix it.\" Uhm, no. \n\nMy husband fixes the spring. Couch is fixed but not really fixed up to the standards I would think a furniture store with a warranty would have. \n\nRemember we have cats with claws? So the \"leather\" recliner we purchased had a broken frame about 14 months in. Well, as we learned earlier, we're screwed on that because \"it only covers fabric!\". A cat decided to use the chair as a scratching post. Man, now we have gouged out fabric on the back of the chair. Maybe we can use that expensive warranty now? Let's call and see! \"Warranty does not cover pets EXCEPT if it's vomit.\" Oh my God stop changing the rules during the game, Levin! Why do your salespeople say one thing and your warranty another?\n\nSecond trip time. We learned our lesson - do not purchase warranty. Ok, let's go see if we can get a deal on a bedroom set during the Memorial Day sale (hopefully better than last weeks sale or the sale the week before that...how many sales can one company have before it's just their normal price?). \n\nAs usual, a salesperson flies in from no where upon us entering the building. Must smell the plastic from the card or something. We say \"we're looking for now but will call you over if we see anything\". Looking around, we find something we both like. A bit pricey and out of our range but let's just see, right? No harm, no foul. The salesperson is more than happy to take us to customer service to see how much credit we can get and if there's any options for more credit! And then says there's free cookies! My husband is all for the cookies. I'm questioning everything. No such thing as free in Levin...\n\nSo the salesperson works with the credit person to see what we can afford. We have a good chunk of credit but not enough to buy today. Solution! Eat up our credit and then also have us do their \"no credit\" financing for the remainder! It's only like $300 down! Monthly payments of around $100! Pay it off early and no interest! Hahaha. These guys are hilarious. I say \"let me think about it. that's a lot of money to put down as well as credit to eat up on something I haven't thought about\". Salesperson states that she will \"lock in the price\" and we can let her know our thoughts. She also \"throws in\" a cleaning kit on the paper order so we're set when we decide. We leave the store.\n\nWe think it over for the next few weeks. We don't want it any more. Much better furniture out there for way less. Finally, I get our monthly Levin bill (still paying on that first purchase). What? $32.08 charge from Levin? No available credit? What's going on? Oh...dear...must not have called that salesperson to say we don't want the furniture. Maybe they put a charge on it as part of the hold. \n\nCall up Robinson Levin's. \"That $32.08 is from the furniture cleaner that you took home.\" We didn't take home any furniture cleaner. \"Well, you must have.\" Can I talk to the salesperson? \"She's busy. She'll call you later\". Fast-forward 2 WEEKS later to a voicemail from her. \"You called about the furniture I have on hold for you. You took home the furniture cleaner so we charged you.\" I immediately call back to inform her that we took nothing home and don't want the order. \"Oh, well, I thought you did take it that day. Ok, I'll credit your account and release the hold.\" Finally got somewhere! \n\nNext month's statement = no available credit and no return credit. Time to take matters into my own hands. I write a letter to Synchrony (Levin Furniture CC) stating what happened, that I'm being charged for something I don't have, and that there is a mythical hold on my account that is being reported as 99% filled when it should only be reporting as 32%. After a week, credit is on the account for the cleaner! Amazing! But still CREDIT HOLD. Dear God I'm in the Twilight Zone. \n\nAnd then I get an invite to your \"private sale\". I have crappy furniture, a credit hold, and you think I'll buy more? Pssh.
