We always like hit the B&M cigar lounges\/shops when we are in a new town visiting. I really tried with Fox, I wanted to like this place. I spend on the average 200 bucks when I visit a place with a nice selection like Cigar Fox. I alway try anything new I haven't had before. But the staff here, in particular the female bartender with snarky rude comments made me keep my money in my pocket. Paid for the sticks we smoked and left. She must own the place, or is wealthy, because she sure don't care about service. Twice I asked her questions and she acted like I was bothering her each time, then replied with smart ass remarks. So off we go, directly to find another lounge. There are too many nice cigar lounges in the valley that actually have friendly staff and treat customers well.
