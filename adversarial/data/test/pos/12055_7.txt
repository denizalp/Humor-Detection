Trying to decide where to dine in Vegas is like trying to decide what one item of clothing to take from the Vogue fashion closet.  Seriously.  On our first night in Vegas for convention we decided to stay at the hotel (Mirage) since we were pretty tired.  Japonais had a promising menu so we made reservations.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.  I ordered two sushi rolls which were good.  The tempura app was also tasty.  I would have liked to have had time to sit in the lounge area pre- dinner, but I was a little busy engaging in some retail therapy.  ;)  All in all, Japonais is a nice place to grab a bite to eat.
