I have not been much of a comic book fan.  I mean I read some of the Batman comics growing up but I didn't collect them or anything.  The few graphic novels I actually enjoyed reading were Sin City and Lone Wolf and Cub.  This being the premiere summer for super hero movies, I figured it was now time more than ever to begin to familiarize myself with the marvel and DC Universe.  \n\nAlternate Reality Comics being very close to UNLV campus and my home, and having rave reviews by, I decided to check it out myself.  The store is actually very decent sized and the outside is quite comical the store mascot, painted in a variety of super hero pictures.  However, I feel that the actual store itself is much to be desired.\n\nTo be fair it is a pretty big comic book shop but that is because they space everything out and towards the back of the store a some sort of fake tattoo station takes up a bulk of the space.  As far as the selection goes there are a variety of Batman books and a TON of Green Lantern comics.  Also Superman has a rack all by itself.  It would be nice to see a wider selection of comics, there are literally dozens of DC and Marvel Superhero alone.  \n\nOne part of the store I thought was pretty awesome was a $1.00 wall of comic books that had such works dating back to the inception of comics.  Very cool, very big selections. \n\nThere are two things I found unpleasant about my visit to Alternate Reality Comics. 1)The god awful, hipster induced, indie music blaring out on the stereo system.  Oh My God was it bad.  It was so annoying it distracted me the entire time I was there, one rock song had a total of three words in the entire lyric of the song, repeating in an endless loop, banging my eardrums into oblivion!  You may think that I'm overreacting but I find this type of music unbearable, I dont know maybe I came in on a bad day and they play regular music on the other days.\n\n2) The staff was friendly and everything but they kept to themselves most of the times.  They greeted me once as I entered the door but didnt pay attention to anything within the store and I really dont see anything wrong with it, but it worried me that it may be a store that could have the possibility of shoplifting if not fixed.\n\nUltimately my visit to Alternate Reality Comics was ok.  nothing bad, but nothing great.  I recommend it to people who are just trying to pick up some new reading material.  For die hard comic book fans, I feel they may be a tad bit of a disappointment but nothing to completely shatter their passion.  I give this store a 3\/5
