Blooze is your standard dark ass bar. And it's mainly for bikers, so if you tried to wear a collared shirt in there, my guess is you'd probably be jumped.  \n\nThey have live music sometimes and the drinks are really cheap. And I think it's owed to their $2.50 well drinks served every day up to 6pm that Blooze is always raging during the day. They also have $1.25 beers every single day, all day long.  \n\nThis bar is trouble.  The drinks are so cheap that you end up drinking way more than you planned and then you find yourself dancing, flanked in between two biker dudes wearing bandanas.  Be careful.
