Everyone said it, and I'll repeat it: This is THE BEST buffet in Vegas.\n\nEat here. Like seriously eat here.\n\nNormally I don't like buffets because I never feel like \"I get my money's worth\" or whatever nonsense, but this is the exception. Forget Wicked Spoon, forget whatever else you've heard, BACCHANAL. The quality of food here is so good that I wouldn't mind eating here multiple times and just enjoy the different foods, because--yeah sure a specialty restaurant might be better with their specialty item--but this place comes pretty freaking darn close, in every cuisine too.\n\nVery clean, awesome and attentive service, nice and spacious.\n\nI believe it's around $50-55 dollars or so for dinner on Friday, but not completely sure. We were walked in to the front of the line and paid for (any Diamond+ members can do that I think) by my awesome friend's dad :) :) :) definitely made the meal better but I'll try to be unbiased. (LOLwhoamIkidding)\n\n----Food\n-Brisket, prime rib for meat. GREAT. They have others too but I could not fit anything else in my stomach no matter how hard I tried.\n-They have ramen. And pho. I only had the ramen but it was pretty great terms of ramen. I compared to ones I've had in L.A. (L.A. is def better) but I mean c'mon what can you expect, it's good enough.\n\n******** Truffled Potato Gratin *****************\n^^^ NOTE THIS ITEm. TRUFFLED POTATO GRATIN. GET IT. THEN GET MORE.\nTRUST ME. TRUFFLED POTATO GRATIN. nothing I can say will explain the truffled potato gratin.\n\nIf that wasn't clear enough, get the truffled potato gratin. It's by the meat section. You're welcome.\n**************************************************\n-Another key item is the *PEACH GREEN TEA* drink. Order it, it's soooooooooo good. Even if you just want a taste (it's a buffet!) I've never heard of it or had it til my friends all got it, and oh boy this drink just makes me hate any other buffet for not having anything close to it.\n\n-They also have sushi, and more variety and better quality sushi than any other (general) buffet I've seen in Vegas, including Wicked Spoon. Tuna and salmon, sashimi and nigiri, and wasabi. The only downside is I couldn't find any tiny bowls for soy-sauce-and-wasabi :-\/ step up yo gaammeee bacchanal!\n\n-Xiaolongbao (Chinese pork buns) and other Asian section dishes. Man they have like everything here. Tasty, but I didn't eat too much because high carb-to-price-ratio and we Asians all know we can't be eating those at buffets ;)\n-Crawfish was decently great.\n-Standard (good quality) crab legs. Can ask for it hot or cold!\n-Good desert bar.\n-Oysters are good too, not the BEST but they're passable if you like oysters.\n\nI know I've missed a ton of sections and foods but trust me, you can go multiple times and still love the darn place. Honestly the highest quality gourmet foods I've ever tasted in a buffet. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
