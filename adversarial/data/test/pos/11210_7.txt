Dining al fresco to celebrate one of my favorite people's birthday was a great chance to check out this much hyped DTLV spot. We had a large group at a picnic table on the patio in the back, it has a charming feel to it. Water and drinks are served in mason jars, another detail which was cute. \n\nSince it is summer in Vegas, I was looking for a light option: the Strawberry Salad another Yelper was enjoying looked great. First I asked if any protein could be substituted for chicken, as I'm a Pescetarian: answer was no. The salad was indeed refreshing with berries, walnuts, gorgonzola and mixed greens. When the bill arrived, I was shocked that I was charged $12.00; the same price as the salad with chicken. A \"tall\" Belvedere and soda was also $12.00. Didn't want to nitpick at a party, so I paid my $31 (with Auotgrat, tax etc) and we explored the teeter totter\/smoking area of patio and took photos. \n\nService was professional and a little over zealous on bussing. Different people kept asking to clear plates and at one point, took someone's unfinished meal. Water glasses were regularly filled and we were asked if we needed more drinks, etc. Those having the chicken and waffle sandwich were underwhelmed: the waffle was not crispy on the outside and one said something seemed to be missing. Both the sweet potato tot and fried pickle I tasted were good; the sriracha ketchup was great - and I don't care for ketchup! In all, the meals were good, but not great. \n\nThe patio is really pretty and has some quirky and interesting decor: mismatched plates adorn one wall and a large portrait of horses ummm mating, another. Eclectic. It looks very pretty lit up at night. \n\nI'd definitely come back for drinks, the bar looked cool and drink prices were reasonable. The menu could use some tweaking especially in the non-fried food, vegetarian options. A welcome addition to Fremont Street. \n\nYelp 100 Challenge
