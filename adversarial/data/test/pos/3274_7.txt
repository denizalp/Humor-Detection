Ordered 2 items:\n- half roast duck\n- clay pot sea bass with tofu\n\nFlavor of food is just OK.  Not spectacular.\nHowever service this evening was horrible.\n\nWe waited more than 30 min, before the waitress realized that we haven't got our food yet.  She actually may not have realized it if the busboy had not pointed it out to her.\n\nThen she rushed in to the kitchen to check on our order and pushed our order.  The roast duck with rice came frst.\n\nIt's another 15 min +before the fish came.\n\nSo for sure will not come back to this place anymore ...
