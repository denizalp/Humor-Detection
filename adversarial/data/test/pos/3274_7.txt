One of those places where it sucked so bad that you just had to review it right away. \n\nFirst off, when we arrived no one was there to greet us. We just stood there like idiots. I had to ask the chef if we're suppose to sit ourselves. And I guess.. Yes you are suppose to sit yourselves if no one acknowledges you ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ \n\nNot a busy day. Our waters came out 10 minutes from sitting down, which is a pretty long time for just waters. And than a waiter came by and asked if anyone has taken our orders, uhhh no you haven't taken our orders! \n\nLet me tell you, this is by far the worse presentation of sushi I have ever seen. The sushi you buy at the grocery store has a better presentation. The fish is falling off the sushi, the sushi is falling apart, the seaweed is not properly sticking. What a mess! It was just a visual disaster. As seen on my pictures.\n\nThe rice looked like it had been sitting out too long. You can tell by the picture I posted, it was pretty hard. \n\nI do not even know what sushi roll came out because when they were brought out they didn't even tell us which roll was which. So that is why in my pictures I do not have the name of the roll. \n\nEven the edamame tasted old. Looked like they just sprinkled salt on top of the frozen ones you buy at albertsons. \n\nThe workers looked like they were tired and having a bad day. \n\nI will not returning... Ever. Sushi craving was NOT satisfied! What a waste of a sushi day.
