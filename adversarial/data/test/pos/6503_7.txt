I hate Best Buy. How dare you even call yourself \"Best Buy\" when you are nowhere near the \"best buy\" on anything? Your prices are inflated to a point that I find offensive and your staff has to be some of the rudest, most entitled (to what, I cannot tell you) group of individuals I've ever met. \n\nWas there a couple years back with Collin S. to easily get the worst customer service I've ever received while trying to buy a giant HDTV. The main TV salesman straight up refused to help me. I asked for his assistance several times, he ignored me and was just a cocky son of a bitch like helping me was somehow beneath him. It took everything out of me not to unleash a YOU WORK FOR ME ASSHAT on him, but somehow I refrained, probably because I am a lady : )\n\nI ended up having to seek a manager who must've slapped his employee upside the head as all of a sudden he stopped being an asshole and was willing to help me. Thoughtful of them, don't you think? Willing to help me spend $1,000 at their store? That is really just soooo generous of them.\n\nAnyways, I do not like Best Buy. The only Best Buy I like is in a tiny little town called Anderson, South Carolina because everyone who works there is polite and I only go there once a year over Thanksgiving when I'm in town visiting my grandfather. It's in the middle of nowhere so it is the calmest Black Friday Best Buy in the world, I am convinced.\n\nTo make a long story short, if you must go to Best Buy, avoid the one on 20th St & Camelback like the plague, and hop on a plane to Greenville, South Carolina, you'll thank me, I'm certain of it.
