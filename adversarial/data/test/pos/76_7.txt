How can I not rate this as a five star choice? \n\nStaff- Amazing and family owned  CHECK!\nFood- Delish beyond belief   CHECK!\nSetting - Clean and uncluttered  CHECK!\n\nI ordered the bbq beef mini plate. This beef was so awesome that I stuffed myself more than I wanted to for lunch. I didn't eat the rest of the day. I wanted to run around the restaurant wearing the bbq beef on my face like that Buffalo Bill guy from Silence of the Lambs who was making the flesh suit. \"Put the lotion in the basket!!!\". Yeah, him. It was THAT good.
