horrible night club.  they are racist and kicked me out for no reason.   check your cameras and you'll see how kind and generous i was.  apparently, i was a threat.  even their security personnel stated they kick customers out even if they don't agree with it.  I kept asking how I was seen as a threat, and they did not give me an answer.  At the very least let me know why I was kicked out.  It was a horrendous experience.  Never again will I come back to this place!\n\nAlso, their prices for drinks are ridiculously overpriced! $21 for a shot of fireball... FIREBALL. The cheapest drink ever.  And it was about $9 for a SMALL bottle of water.  If you do go to this club, I suggest you drink beforehand because it's expensive and be prepared to get kicked out for no reason!
