Our regular Vegas destination jacks up the price and lowers the quality.\n\nYellow lettuce? Really? \n\nThe up-selling by the waiting staff is absolutely disgusting considering you're going to drop 200 on a meal right off the bat. \"Want some broccoli marinated in the spring waters of switzerland, tears of a unicorn, and sprinkled with shaved mushrooms from Thailand?\" Then they'd exclaim \"Its to die for, I highly recommend it.\" They recommend everything they offer... \n\nFurthermore, I wish the staff would quit trying to relate to me; no matter what State I claim I'm from the waitor always seems to have a story that relates. \"Oh, you're from Los Angeles? I remember traffic in my home town of Texas, it sucks. I relate. We're friends.\"\n\nWay to turn this awesome dining experience into Disneyworld on roids. BARF.
