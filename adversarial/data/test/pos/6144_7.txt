Horrible experience. From the floorplan to the food, bar and casino service everything about this place is WRONG. We started our evening in the resturant, La Bonne Carte - we weren't interested in the buffet - it was overpriced for the selection - still even the entrees we had - overcooked calamri, walleye fish that was boney\/tasteless and mashed potatoes that came out of a box didn't even deserved to be served at a inner school cafeteria. \n\nWe then walked back through the casino - which is laid out like a cruise ship - a tight confined space, with floors stacked over 6 levels but couldn't find a seat at any tables or want  to. The atmosphere was equally crappy- no friendly gamers to be found anywhere, and I can understand why if this was my local gambling option.\n\nCalling it a crap hole does a disservice to other dives. Don't waste your time or your money.
