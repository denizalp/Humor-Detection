Authentic mexican food. Get it made your way. Hard tacos & CalientÃª picante salsa. Smells sooo good and is located next to a Taco Bell lpl.  Very nice service. Made to order. Only $1.99 for hard tacos beef or chicken, and real shredded cheese. They werent tight on the salsa either. I had it to go they incl. limes napkins without me asking. Sooo yummy. Ill def. be back.
