The wife and I went to see this show with a group of friends last weekend.  It certainly was a different experience than the typical Vegas show - NO question there.  There's no stage, for starters.  ALL the action happens in front of you, over you, behind you, beside you, and strangely, under you.\n\nSo, the Good:\nvisually stunning, to say the least.  INCREDIBLY athleticism, to put it mildly.  Some of the incredible feats performed left all of us wondering where they found these super heroes!  MANY of the trapeze acts are performed not only with no net and no harness, but with people FAR below the trapeze action, AND also soaking wet  people on said trapezes.  Amazing.\n\nThe Bad:\nOk, maybe I'm getting old - but DAMN there's a lot going on at the same time.  Almost from start to finish, multiple stories are taking place across the \"floor\" (so to speak), and there is no WAY I could keep track of everything going on.  As soon as you start focusing on one element, you start missing two more.  Very difficult.\n\nAgain, maybe I'm getting old - but to me, if I were the person having this \"dream\", it would be a nightmare, to put it mildly.  A TON of weird\/scary looking dudes, to say the least.\n\nFinally, again, maybe I'm getting old, but can someone tell me what the hell this was about?  There was no real storyline that I could see - and it wasn't just me - NO ONE in our group (about fifteen of us) understood it.\n\nBottom line:\nVisually an incredible experience.  Athletically mind-boggling.\n\nJust don't expect to understand it.
