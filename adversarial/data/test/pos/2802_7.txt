I made a reservation at Nikko the past weekend through OpenTable, but when showed up at the restaurant, the lights were off and it was closed.  There was no mention of this on the restaurant's website and additionally I was able to book a reservation on OpenTable.com.  So there I was, with a date, at 7:00 pm with no where to eat- a GREAT experience for me and my date.\n\nWhen I emailed the restaurant asking for an explanation, I was told that I must \"have the wrong location.\"  Of course I was at the only location I know, in South End.  They placed blame on me rather than taking responsibility for being closed after I had made a reservation.  \n\nI can't comment on the quality of the food or atmosphere, but the management.... extremely poor in my opinion.
