I had heard so many good things about notion. But I was not prepared for how fancy pants it is! I'd have to say this is maybe the fanciest place I've been to before. And I'm not just talking about the interior. I'm talkin' bout the whole package!\n\nFor $65 you receive four courses. You get to pick between three different items between every course. It's really a nice mix of food and my eyes went straight to certain picks. But what I didn't realize was that we got what I'll call the \"bonus rounds.\" I wish I could describe to you all of the bonus rounds, I'll leave you with the surprise. Let's just say they were all incredibly unique and a fun little treat (and I can't describe them for the life of me, so there's that). \n\nHere were my dish picks:\nBeet with blueberries, hibiscus, creme fraiche\nScallops imitating gnocchi with peppermint, parmesan broth\nTenderloin with burnt onion, thinly sliced portabella and hazlenut\nMilk Chocolate Nutella Cake, orange and banana pudding\n\nI will first say I loved all the sauces they add to the dish right in front of you! I love a good sauce and the added bonus was watching them compliment the dish with the pairing sauce (see, fancy!). I thought the beets were great. I was a bit disappointed with the scallops, as I felt it could have used a bit more flavor. I loved the tenderloin though! They don't even ask you how you want it cooked, it just comes out medium rare, like it should be cooked all the time! I also really enjoyed the dessert. I loved the little bits of banana pudding mixed with the Nutella cake.\n\nAll the plates were small, but I was full by the time I was done. Not stuffed, but totally satisfied. And I lied, one of the bonus rounds was chocolate truffles, chocolate sticks and chocolate wafers. I was totally into this bonus round and even may have finished off others truffles. Oops. \n\nBut dining here is an experience. It's not just a dinner out. The way the wait staff caters to your every need, describes every single dish to you as it comes out and replaced every single napkin if you get up. Now THAT is a good waitstaff!\n\nNo corkage fee, but they're getting ready to get a liquor license so BYOB will be coming to an end soon. I imagine the cocktails will be just as inventive as the food!\n\nIt's hard to put too much of the dinner into words, you just have to go for yourself!
