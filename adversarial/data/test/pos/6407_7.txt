My wife and I recently visited her 97 year old mom at a hospice center near this Burger King. After our visit we were both starving and went to this Burger King with a coupon we received in the mail. It was for 2 Whopper JRs and 2 small fries for $3.99. Not a bad deal! When we got to the window to receive our order we were told the fries were not ready and to pull into the parking lot. They would bring our order out to us. So I complied.\nMaybe 3-4 min later (didn't get his name) brought us 2 full sized whoppers and 2 large French fries and apologized for the inconvenience. The burgers were hot and freshly made as were the fries. I'm so glad because it kept my wife buried in her meal instead of telling me how to drive all the way home!  Ha ha\nThank you Burger King!!!
