What comes to mind when I think back on my experience at Salt is: Identity Crisis. \n\nThis place can't decide what it's about or who it's about. \n\nWalking in, it has a very loungy feel. A swanky, unconventionally shaped, contemporary style bar is the heart of the place with chairs and couches surrounding it.  It is very dark (a little too dark in my opinion) with very dim lighting...I felt like most of the light came from the gigantic big screen tv's hanging above the bar) I actually like the look of the place but I feel like everything else is a contradiction. \n\nThey had EXTREMELY loud hip hop music playing.  Dance club loud, and this is very obviously not a dance club. (I don't think? Like I said Salt doesn't know what it is so how am I supposed to?) I was on a date and found it very difficult to have good conversation without constantly saying \"WHAT?!\" \"SAY THAT AGAIN?!\" ...the upside that I'm sure my date appreciated is I had to snuggle in close just so we could talk.  \n\nThe tv's were playing ESPN, highlights from one of the preseason NFL games. I love football but this just didn't make any sense to me at all. This place does not have a sports bar feel and the tv's seemed so out of place to me and I found them to be a negative distraction. \n\nWhen we sat down at the bar it was SOPPING wet.  I asked the bartender for a napkin for my arm because I had set it on the bar for a second and he handed me a wet rag.  Really?  \n\nThe drink selection is poor.  I had a glass of Sauv Blanc that I disliked very much.  My date was disappointed to find out they didn't have Guinness on tap.  Their beer selection was nothing to write home about. \n\nThe service was awful.  The bartenders were too busy busting a move to the hip hop music to notice the needs of their customers.  And did I mention there were only a handful of people in the bar at 11:30 on a friday night?\n\nSo what is Salt?  A hip hop night club?  A swanky scottsdale lounge? A sportsbar? None of the above.  Salt is just plain confused if you ask me.
