Prompt, courteous service but for the love of all that is holy please stop cracking your gum! I don't know how a person can make gum sound so gross. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. Nice people but EWWW. \n\nETA: I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5, because the gum thing was quickly addressed in the nicest way possible. Thanks guys. You will be my company's go to folks for all future fingerprinting needs.
