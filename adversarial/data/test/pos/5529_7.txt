This is an update on the below review.  Chris messaged me after the review nothing that my experience was not typical or what they aim to do.  After two additional visits, I am a believer.\n\nThe food here is outstanding, both the Chinese and Japanese dishes.  Ingredients are fresh and the flavors superb.  Portions are more than satisfying.  But now the service shows the same attention to detail.  I am a fan.  \n\nPoor service and uncaring staff turned an otherwise four star experience to a two star disaster.  Not even the delicious food could compensate for serving one person at the table's meal 16 minutes after the other two.  And then to be told that it was ready and waiting to be served in the kitchen but the \"the waiter got backed up\" is inexcusable.  Barely an apology and nothing to compensate.  Pitiful.  Peter, the manager, made excuses and then dismissed me as my experience here clearly mattered nothing to him. He is clearly unqualified for his job.  And they are not worthy of my patronage. I will not be back.
