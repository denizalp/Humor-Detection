Everything about this place is amazing... their sandwiches, their milkshakes, their cookies....\n\nIt's located not too far from my house so I'm slowly making my way through their menu, but can honestly say that the chicken karaage sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The chicken is crispy and moist, and the sauce (basically a spicy\/sriracha mayo) is heaven. I've also tried the beef and kimchi sandwich which was also great, but I still prefer the karaage.\n\nFor milkshakes (three of the best milkshakes I've ever had), I tried the Oreo, tiramisu, and chocolate brownie. I think the tiramisu has been my favourite, with the Oreo coming a close second. The milkshakes are extremely rich and full of ice cream so don't watch them make it... just drink and enjoy it!
