Excellent food & service for a great price! \n\nWe used a groupon and ordered garlic knots, calamari, and a large pizza (don't judge) everything was super fresh and delicious tasting. Their calamari is awesome...and so is the marinara it is served with. The portions are quite big so we had plenty to take home. The knots and calamari is enough for  a quick\/inexpensive meal for two. The atmosphere is nice enough for a date, but casual\/relaxed enough to pop in with the entire family. \n\nI wish it was a little closer to my house but when I am in the area I will definitely come back!
