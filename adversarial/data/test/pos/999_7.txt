This place isn't terrible. There is an abundance of $10 blackjack tables with plenty of empty seats, although the odds don't seem to be that liberal. It's kinda tough to get service at the bars sometimes. I like how the \"high-roller\" room has $1 slots and $25 table minimums. This would make me a Turkish Billionaire! \nThere is occasionally live music in the form of a multi-talented, ethnically diverse band. They seem to draw a big crowd to the dance floor. I was even politely asked to dance by a nice man wearing a cowboy hat, whom I of course had to turn down as he had built up the cajones to ask me only after my fiancee meandered over to the bar. \nOne of the downsides is the clientele. It seems to me that a lot of the patrons of the casino aren't the type who can afford to lose too much. But it is a casino, after all.
