this place has been voted by lv review journal readers as the best sandwich year after year.\n\ni've eaten at nearly every location in las vegas and would say without a doubt they are the best. \n\nMy wife loves this place so much one time she bit into a hair-tie in the middle of a sandwich-spit it out and kept on chowing down.\n\nThe Capistrami & Bobbie are my favorites.\n\nThe capistrami is hot pastrami with their special cole slaw & russian dressing on a fresh roll 12 or 20 inch\n. \nThe bobbie is a thanksgiving delight. everything on a roll. turkey,stuffing and cranberry sauce with or without mayo!!\n\nthe service is always fast & friendly. the atmosphere is that of a small-town deli\/sandwich shoppe and the food is always consistent & great. a little more $$ than others but always worth it
