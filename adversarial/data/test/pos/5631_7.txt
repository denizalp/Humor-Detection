I think I can finally say that I've found a yoga studio that I truly love in BYS Yoga. It's been a long while, jumping between several studios in different cities, since I've found a studio that I've walked into and felt like I'm at home.\n\nThe studio is much larger than I expected. It's on the 3rd floor inside the old Ukrainian building on Carson. Once you walk inside, just keep walking up! Once you reach the top, you need to mindful of classes before you. If you arrive in the evening. There are usually 2 back-to-back classes with a little break. The hardwood floors are a little  creaky, so you need to watch your step!\n\nThe studio offers a ton of yoga equipment to borrow for class: mats, blocks, straps, and bolsters. Everyone is super respectful of the equipment and it is clearly cared for by the staff. Speaking of the staff, I really liked the fact that they offer a 2-week unlimited pass to try out a variety of classes and teachers. Everyone I've interacted with has been super friendly and helpful.\n\nThe pass is also very reasonable at $30. After that they have various class packages.\n\nGoing to this studio has really made me want to invest in my practice and myself. I can't wait to get back to the studio!
