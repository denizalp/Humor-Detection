HIRE MORE SERVERS OMGGGGGGGGGGG\n\nPho is supposed to be quick. I don't understand why it takes more than 30 minutes to take an order and serve the dang food!!! \n\nFood was taking way too long so asked for togo but they forgot the things I asked them to include when they knew we were leaving early because we were in a rush. OMG..... So frustrating
