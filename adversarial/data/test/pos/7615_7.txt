This place was kind of funny, but mostly in a dumb way. Maybe it was just a little too Vegas for my taste.\n\nWe came to see Avicii via a promoter who my friend knew, but since we came on a particularly busy night, we weren't actually going to be able to get inside to the dance floor where Avicii was going to be playing (which we learned after arrival).\n\nThe bartenders here apparently don't like you unless you're a cute girl or a really sexy masculine man, so it took a while to get a drink. I had to really bring out the gay to get their attention, but after I called someone hun, I had my cocktail in a jiffy.\n\nOur whole group ended up getting into the main room to see Avicii. I'm not saying that the bouncer asked for money in exchange for letting us through. Why would that ever happen in Vegas? All I'm saying is that one moment we were out and the next we were in.\n\nOnce inside the main room, they wouldn't let us onto the actual dance floor, so we had to wait until the bouncer blocking access to the floor was preoccupied with someone else trying to push their way past him, at which point we were able to slip by unnoticed.\n\nI'm a really determined individual.\n\nThe actual show was a pretty terrible experience. We were packed onto the floor like oranges that are packed together really tightly. The scantily clad dancer next to me kept kicking drinks off of her little stage whenever someone set them down and, inevitably, a number of them went flying toward me. Thanks, lady.\n\nAvicii came on obnoxiously late. My friends said that this was the longest they had ever waited for anyone at XS. We couldn't leave the dance floor because we wouldn't have been able to get back in... what's the point of being on the dance floor if you can't leave to go get a drink? Avicii came on at 1:45am, by which time we were sober, annoyed, squished, and a little wet and smelly from the alcohol shower courtesy of basically-naked lady (the alcohol wasn't flowing where it counted).\n\nI felt bad for anybody who spent real money on this, because it was just so terrible, haha.\n\nWe left mid set. It was cool to stay to see Avicii just to be able to say we did, but he came on soooo late and wasn't even impressive when he did come on. People were shoving and being rude and getting in fights. There were a handful of really nice people apologizing for having to shove to squeeze past and whatnot, but most were just aggressive and rude.\n\nWe went somewhere else to get drinks afterward and had a blast.\n\nThis was great for a \"Vegas\" experience, I guess, but I doubt I'll ever go back. And it's definitely the last time I'm ever wasting a minute on Avicii, haha!
