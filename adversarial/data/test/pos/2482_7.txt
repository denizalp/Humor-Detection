Krazy Fish has been on my radar for quite some time. With crazy steel art festooned on their front patio and dive-y exterior, what more could you ask for in Plaza Midwood? This place is ridiculous. Landing directly on Central Ave, it's not too hard to miss their parking lot. Turn in right before Morningside. Made that mistake once....\n\nGlad to see that \"Krazy\" is first word in the name of this joint. Our server, Chad, was a freaking ray of sunshine. Hilarious and absolutely BLUNT. He had no problems telling us that some menu items were \"dumb\" if paired with others. He was jazzed to be there. What a great employee. He was fast, efficient and a great jokester. \n\nMystery beer is interesting....$1 and you'll, most likely, get a crappy beer. Haha. Worth the $1 laugh it brought to our table. Bud Light with lime. GAG.\n\nApps:\n\nStarted out with the potato cakes. These things are awesome. Plenty of veggies and in a creamy curry-ish sauce. I would have mistaken them for falafel had I not been told. I was happy and so were my taste buds. Throw a little sriracha on these bag boys and you'll experience Krazy enlightenment. \n\nEntrees:\n\nMy wife got a fried veggie burrito. This thing rivals the size of a Chipotle or Moe's burrito. Packed full of rice and tons of tasty veggies. Loved the sauce that the veggies were saut√©ed in. Welcomingly sweet and a came full circle with the rest of her plate. The grits on the side were so thick and creamy. I'd have a full plate on my next visit if it were an entree. Delicious. \n\nI tried the blackened tuna tacos. Holy crap. Pineapple salsa? I'd eat that on my foot. It was so good. Perky, cilantro-ey and so FRESH. I love every bit. Huge chunks of rare, seared tuna. The slaw, I'm pretty sure, is tossed in a bit of wasabi powder so it got dumped off my tacos lickity split. No offense. Just not a fan of wasabi. Got a side of the mac n' cheese per Chad's recommendation. So good. Soul food, meet Mexican. Be friends, I say. \n\nSampled the blueberry salsa and the chipotle honey. Very interesting. Look forward to trying them on their respective dishes on our next visit. \n\nI'm happy to say Krazy Fish literally is crazy but absolutely intriguing. I can't wait to test more of the menu. Well done, ladies and gents. You've got something going here.
