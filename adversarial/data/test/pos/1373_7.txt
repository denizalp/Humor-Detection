This place could easily be called \"Fabric to the power of ten\" because there are at least that many bolts of fabric in the warehouse. I'm not kidding. Thousands upon thousands of choices and dozens of aisles to walk up and down. It's like the Costco of fabric. It's positively maddening, the selection. Go in with at least a vague idea of what you're looking for otherwise you'll leave bald from tearing out your hair over the decision-making dilemma.\n\nIt's an easily missable depot in the \"Stockyards\" complex at Keele\/St. Clair close to the Home Depot\/Rona\/Canadian Tire trifecta and the Staples and Sleep Comfort. You'd never happen upon it, it's the type of place that you have to consciously embark on a pilgrimage to visit. The prices are rock solid and you can often barter with the employees because they don't get a lot of traffic so they're willing to part with fabric at lower prices just to create some movement. \n\nIt's nothing beautiful or fancy but they have pretty much every type of fabric you'd ever need, including beautiful Chinese brocade, embroidery silks, jacquard, taffeta, tulle, linen and funfur. Yes, funfur. Do candy kids even still exist? PLUR, y'all.
