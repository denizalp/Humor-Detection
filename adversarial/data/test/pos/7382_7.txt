Great little place with really good Indian food.\n\nFrom all the reviews and comments on the decor (or lack there of), I expected some kind of stark white, institutional-type feel to this place. Not so! It's actually quite quaint inside. I disagree with one of the posts that you can't take a date here. Sure you can! I totally dig the cheesy asian velvet paintings.\n\nI didn't opt for the lunch buffet, although it looked pretty decent...containing fairly common dishes. And for $8.99, it's reasonable as well. They have a pretty expansive menu, including goat dishes (hmm, never had goat...). I ended up getting the Lamb Vindaloo with some Naan to go. The lamb was very good although I would have liked it hotter. It seems a lot of Indian restaurants don't believe you when you say you like it HOT. I'll have to be more persistent next time ;) The naan was excellent, perfectly cooked and chewy. Oh, and thankfully, the entrees include rice (a rarity). \n\nAs I waited for my takeout, I was offered water...a nice touch and well appreciated. I will definitely be back!
