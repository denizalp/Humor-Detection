What a strange little place, a little beatnik flavor for sure. It could use a cleaning and sprucing. \n\nI had steel cut oats with bananas and nuts. The banana chunks were mouthful sized and the nuts tasted old to me. Stick to fruit only. \n\nMy boyfriend had a veggie and egg breakfast burrito. It looked decent and was definitely good sized. They cannot do egg whites only. \n\nThe cafe au lait was good and my decaf latte was very good as well. We took an energy bar to go, it looks interesting and smells great but we haven't broken into it yet. I'm curious to see how it is. \n\nOh, have a scone for me, they looked amazing.
