I'm always up for a good egg sandwich for breakfast.  As such, the wife and I had to give Eggslut a try.  We arrived around 10AM on a Monday morning.  There was a short line, but it moved fast since the menu was very concise, there weren't many customization options to consider, orders were taken efficiently, and the kitchen pumped out food at very steady pace.  The wife and I shared a Fairfax ($8, soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun) w\/bacon (add $3) and a Slut ($10), a coddled egg on top of potato pur√©e cooked in a small Mason jar topped with chives and served with a toasted baguette slices.  Our Fairfax was hot, fresh, and satisfying, but messy and somewhat difficult to eat trying to keep it all together.  The light, airy brioche bun was the true star of the sandwich.  The Slut was simple, yet delicious.  Honestly, it outshined the Fairfax by a country mile.  Was Eggslut a bit overpriced?  Perhaps, but I thought their use of fresh, quality ingredients justified the price.  Is Eggslut a horrible name for restaurant?  I'm no prude, but it may be off-putting to some, which would be a shame since Egglut is easily the best place for breakfast at the Cosmo.
