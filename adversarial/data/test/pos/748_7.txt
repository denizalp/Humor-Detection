I have mixed feelings about this place. I'll start with the good.\n\n1.Awesome pools. Clean and beautiful.\n2.Super clean room. Cozy, big bathroom and good selection of tv channels.\n3.Friendly staff.\n\nThe Bad\n1.Upon checking in we were charged $300 extra. As insurance in case we trashed the room. While i'm assuming this is standard we were unaware of it and pretty pissed.\n2.When we checked out we were charged $15 a night for spa entry and shuttle to the strip. Oh really? I dont remember receiving any of those services.\n3.My best friends room was never cleaned by house keeping. Why you ask? Well the maids must have been too busy stealing her phone charger and brothers phone.\n\nAll in all our stay was ok but if we return to Vegas we will be staying elsewhere.
