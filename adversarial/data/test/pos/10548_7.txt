Rude, we weren't acknowledged by any of the staff. One even went out of his way to pretend to be doing something very important on his phone as we approached his area. Other people browsing were acknowledged, one was a mere inch away from us.\n\nThe furniture itself is overpriced crap quality furniture. I've seen better things at Ikea.\n\nWe were treated much better and saw more unique items at every other furniture store in the area.\n\nSaying hello and acknowledging your guests is literally the cheapest investment you can make to get a guest to be a customer. We spend a lot of money on home furnishings, but we can't justify spending any at CB2.
