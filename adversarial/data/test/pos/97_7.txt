The general area fills up fast and a lot of people save chairs which is understandable.  We opted to pay the extra $10 to sit in the reserved pool area but that still only guaranteed the white chairs which did not have shade or an umbrella.\n\nBummer that the entire pool is 3+ feet tall but I guess it prevents people from trying to actually swim or move around to a different part.  The $16 giant bloody was nice and refreshing and the refill option for $11(?) was a great deal.  I also liked that it was pretty empty so you could play with the water basketball & shoot hoops in the pool.  Just be sure not to sit under \/ behind the hoop!  \n\np.s. I'm a little grossed out that the clean towels are just in a large bin and come out unfolded.  It really makes no difference...but it feels like it is less clean when the employee pulls one out of the bin & they are not pre-folded.
