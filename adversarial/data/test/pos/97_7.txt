Salami scramble - I tried to remove all the salami after I tasted rancid fat, but the rancid taste was also on the overcooked eggs. \n\nSo I tried to eat the hash browns. They couldn't be cut, chopped or broken with fork or knife, but I managed to spear the entire brick and gnaw chunks off. I felt my teeth did some manly, brutish work.
