This is my favorite ramen place in California and in Vegas. I always order the Jinya Chicken Ramen and it's so delicious and flavorful. I like it because it's lighter than other usual ramen broths were its normally really salty. I add an egg and call it a day and it's pure perfection. I also really like their pork buns!\n\nPrice is reasonable. About $10 for a huge ramen bowl. Service is great and the ambiance is nice and somewhat dim and moody. Oh and major bonus points for their bathroom and their amazing Japanese toilets that have seat warmers and other fun functions!\n\nI love how this location isn't too far from the strip. So if you want to get out of the Strip for a bite to eat, this is your place. Totally worth coming here for lunch or dinner!
