I'm a regular here and they're always out of something or inconsistent. \nThey took my mom's money today and made her drink before letting her know they don't have anything to make the rose green tea that I get every time. \nPlease get your shit together tea time.\n\nOk Update: \n     It's been 8 days and I decided to go back bc I wanted a drink. And sis. Guess what they didn't have?? You got it?! That's right! They didn't have shit to make the Rose Green tea. That's my drink you guys, like that's the one for me. \nI've been a regular here for about 4 years or so and if they keep this up my family and I won't be coming here anymore. I'll drive farther if it means getting a consistent product. \n\nUPDATE #2:\nY'ALL I CALLED TODAY AND THEY STILL AINT GOT SHIT. What kind of business is this? Who's mans is this? I pretty sure the owner is named ken and wow it doesn't seem like he values his business or regular customers. \nI've been updating this review for 2 weeks. There is literally no excuse for this. \n\nUPDATE #3: \nHey y'all what's good happy 2017,\n\nSo today the owner deadass complained about me to my mom lmao, that's so funny. If you're reading this Ken, please know that it was me who made this comment and also know that my \"nasty\" comments were funny as hell and also not nasty at all.\nI'm sorry if you felt offended by them but honestly as a loyal customer it was frustrating to hear for over two months that you didn't have product. Also I'm an adult and I don't need you to stop mom and call me out. What did you think she was going to do, reprimand me? If you don't appreciate my comments then please know that I do not appreciate that. \nI still come here and I've always been a fan because it's close and the drinks aren't overly sweet. I like your business but that was very unprofessional and this is a public forum where I can post my experiences. \nHere's your 4 stars.
