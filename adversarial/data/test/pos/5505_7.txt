I stayed in 3 hotels in 3 different cities in the last 3 days. This hotel was by far the best. The staff were so nice and polite, it almost felt weird. They upgraded our rooms to corner suites for no charge and we won money vouchers when checking in. This hotel is big and beautiful, 10 stories tall. Three is a concierge room for gold and platinum members on the 10th floor where they have free beverages discounts at happy hour on drinks with free finger food, cheese and salad. It was a nice lounge with comfy chairs and couch with TV and a computer. They Al's have a staff member cater to the guests as they arrive. The rooms were clean, the staff were super polite, I haven't been called sir so many times. They gave me a corkscrew to open up my bottle of wine. Some hotels do not have one, which is frustrating sometimes. I took many pictures to show the size of the place and the common areas. I took nice shots of the pool and whirlpool which was relaxing last night. I would come back again.
