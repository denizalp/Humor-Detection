They served dim sum on Thanksgiving day! $21 for a meal to fill up three people?! It is unbeatable and unbelievable! I was in Denver for dim sum a week earlier and it cost around $38 for two people! I don't know if the dim sum here's freshly made or thawed from frozen but nevertheless I enjoyed my meal here. I had the taro cakes, the fried taro ball, siu mai, ha gow, shrimp balls with sugar cane, mushroom sticky rice inside the leaf, and a couple other dishes. They steam their food in metal containers rather than the wood ones. The only thing that sucked was how long it took for some of the carts to come around. For Thanksgiving they sell a turkey for $58. I don't know how it tastes but it sounded like a cool deal.
