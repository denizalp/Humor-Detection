Ate here a few times since 2004.  Haven't been in many, many months.  Love all but one of the pasties I've tried, thus far.  Great to know that you can call ahead to custom-order!  Also, you may call ahead and have your order started so that it's ready by the time you arrive!  (It took one of my pasties 50 minutes' preparation and cook time from phone call to my table!)\n\nBest to order a few and share!  Keep in mind, one of these pasties could contain up to 1200 calories or more!  One word: BUTTER.  \n\nVegan pasties are also available, but you must call ahead to have them made.
