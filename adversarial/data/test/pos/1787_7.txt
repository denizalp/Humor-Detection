Nothing phenomenal here. Average gas station, near my house so it's become my gas station choice when I'm leaving my house before I begin my day. Gas prices are average for the location. On some cases on the cheaper side. You might run into a pan handler or a sketchy character thought the day. Specially at night. I walk in handle my business and walk out. Nothing to see here.
