There are not enough words to describe how much I hate this place. Do not expect to have a conversation below screaming level. If you can't out shriek a tween at a Bieber concert, you will not be heard here. If you want to dance in a way other than tweaked-out-mosh-bro you're out of luck. It's like standing outside your dorm room, debating whether to just go sleep in the commons, or open the door, flip on the light, and end the embarrassment of your roommate's incompetent hookup blasting the worst bass imaginable through the world's shittiest speakers all to try and mask his failure to have any sort of rhythm.
