When the cab driver pulled into the main entrance to this hotel I already knew I was going to love it. I spotted walls painted bubble gum pink, bright orange, canary yellow... It was really eye popping. And who attracts that much attention with bright colors if they don't have much else to show off?\n\nWalking into the lobby I was warmly greeted by smiling folks at the front desk who checked me in an instructed me on how to find my hotel room. What's neat about this hotel, especially coming from wet and rainy Seattle, is that aside from your actual room, much of the hotel is outdoors! The corridors are open and the actual floor is covered in this bright purple all-weather carpeting. As I searched for my room I could help but wonder what I was in for. Each door in the hotel is painted a different color too. This is not only fun but it's useful for finding your room again.\n\nIn keeping with the rest of the hotel, the latin inspired bright colors are also inside the bedroom. In a tasteful and youthful way, splashes of color appear in artwork, on some some of the linens and pillows and on the bathroom door. It's not overdone at all. The room itself was lovely too. Nothing over the top or luxurious but easily suitable for anyone looking for an affordable place to stay for days on end. \n\nCourtyards and outdoor spaces here are covered with local fauna, water features, places to sit outside in the sun, places to sit in the shade, and of course, two swimming pools and a hot tub! The bigger pool is a nice big lap pool that hosts hotel parties on weekends. In fact, the pool is so hip that there's a stereo system that plays under water so you can listen to music as you swim. \n\nThe communal patio areas around the pool are decorated with modern, brightly colored chairs, tables and various shapes and sizes of padded furniture for lounging on. One thing I loved seeing today as I was out getting some sun was that an employee was steam cleaning each of the pads on the chaise lounges. This hotel is nearly spotless. Small details like this didn't go unnoticed as I even saw people re-painting walls and tending to the common areas to keep them clean and bright for everyone.\n\nOther great spaces in the hotel include a spa, a gym, a large lobby with tons of seating options and a good sized bar with plush sofas and soft seating.\n\nI just stayed here 4 days but I could have easily stayed 4 more!
