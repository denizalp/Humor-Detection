for good measure, yeah, it's CURRY perfection. i could drink it all day long if it weren't spiced. my green curry veggies were obviously fresh, maintaining their integrity even whilst swimming in coconut milk. the yellow curry is even richer and galang-ier. \n\ni am trying to figure out exactly what made it better than any other thai restaurant i've been to-- i think it's the coconut milk\/fish sauce\/galang\/basil balance. Not too sweet, not too salty. \n\non the ratings scale, our server was sceptical i could handle a 10\/20 for spiciness, but i insisted. turns out it wasn't really that spicy. next time i will go for a 15\/20. \n\nand i will avoid the lunch hour rush. we waited about 30 mins for our food, and i agree with other reviewers that the bench wasn't comfortable. and our elbow-to-elbow neighbors kept eavesdropping even with the din throughout.
