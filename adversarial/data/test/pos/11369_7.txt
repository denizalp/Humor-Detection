I'm a regular! Yes indeed... every time I go to Vegas, I make a stop or two or three at Jean Philippe. And now I have 2 locations to choose from! \n\nI always order a berry crepe. Most of the time I order one of their fancy schmancy pastries as well. Those pastries are so pretty sometimes, I feel bad for eating them!!! Good thing that feeling only lasts for a second, because the second I take a bite, I forget how pretty they are and focus on how yummy they are.\n\nDefinitely worth the trip here. Minus one star for the prices. Yes, I get that their leases are astronomical, but my paycheck is not.
