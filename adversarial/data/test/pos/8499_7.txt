I Love Rice!  I Love The Rice Shop!!\n\nChef Tony Zappola took rice bowls to another level.  I have had this review on draft for a very, very long time. I was just too afraid to post it because I fear that the whole world will rush over here, then there will be long lines, then the prices will go up, and then I can't have them for myself.  I know, I'm a little selfish.  Speaking of fish, the Kentucky Fried Fish is amazing and is currently my favorite item here. The secret to Chef Tony's Kentucky Fried Fish is the large pieces of double-breaded cod. I don't know how he manages to keep this dish crispy without the grease. And at the same time, the fish is still as flaky as it gets.  I would eat this dish Kamayan Style (with my hands only) if no one was looking.  Heck, that's the best way to eat this dish. \n\nI have also tried their shrimp, short ribs, and Mochiko Chicken.  The shrimp and short ribs is good.  I recommend the Mochiko Chicken if it's your first time here. You can't go wrong with the Mochiko Chicken at The Rice Shop.  Like the Kentucky Fried Fish, this dish is also breaded to perfection and the serving is huge.  If you're torn between the fish or the chicken, then do what I do and get both. My typical order is their Kentucky Fried Fish with an extra side of Mochiko Chicken.  It's the best of both worlds. \n\nI can't end a review about The Rice Shop and not mention the rice.  I know it's just rice and anyone can cook rice.  Trust me, there's something special about the rice at The Rice Shop.  It is so good and may possibly be the secret to The Rice Shop's success. \n\nBottom line, 5 stars all the way for The Rice Shop.  You won't find long lines or expensive dishes here.  Simply put...you'll only find some of the best fish and chicken bowls at a very low price.  \n\n2017 Yelp Review #59
