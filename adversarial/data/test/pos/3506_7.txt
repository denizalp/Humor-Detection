Try the gator tail;) It was delicious!\n\nTried this place out while visiting Charlotte. My friend loves Cajun food, and had originally tried Razzoo's in TX, and said we have to give this place a try. \n\nI'm glad we did. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious. \n\nWe actually tried so many things off the menu that I'm not sure I can name them all, but I can say that everything we ordered was delicious.\n\nThey have a great outside seating area.
