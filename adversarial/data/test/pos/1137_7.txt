The worst rooms, service, and house keeping in downtown Las Vegas. Absolutely the least accommodating hotel I've ever stayed at. First, they would not cancel my 7 day reservation once I found out how ugly the rooms were, none have good views by the way. Then they moved me to \"another room\" after they threatened to charge me for canceling...the receptionists and security then proceeded to evict me when I lost my temper when they gave me non-working keys to my new room. The D is right next door, stay anywhere besides the downtown grand.
