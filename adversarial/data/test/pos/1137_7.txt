Fashionista... that's not me. I like things basic and simple, but if you dig my style, and want my advice, I would definitely lead you here, but not on a weekend. No no no. If you go here on a weekend, be prepared to be scared by gobs of tourists with rolling suitcases milking the exchange rate for all it's worth, and if you must go on the weekend, avoid the parking decks like the plague! I entered once and almost suffered from a meltdown as I waited in an endless line of looping traffic and imagined the whole thing collapsing on my head! If you are a tourist, then take advantage of the ACE Gold line that will take you straight here. \n\nBack to the fashion, I must admit that I should probably just be writing a review of the French Connection outlet here, as that is where I make a good 75% of my clothing purchases. It is a large store with a helpful, proactive staff willing to grab you an extra size when you underestimate the size of your toosh. And, when they have a sale, I feel criminal with all the steals I find! If there is no sale event, then I generally take a pass.\n\nOther personal store highlights here include J. Crew, Diesel (I have found so many fab dresses here!), Kenneth Cole (found my favorite flip flops here for $10), Theory and Puma. They also have some notable luxury brands, including Burberry, Juicy, Ferragamo, and Malandrino. All in all a nice mix of some solid basics with some fancy fixins. And, when it is not 100+ outside, I bask in the window-shopping outdoor experience. You don't have to worry about dodging cars quite like you do at Town Square. \n\nSome of the stores here are repeats of stores at the other outlet, and honestly, all of the repeat stores are generally bigger at the other place. For example, the Vans store on Las Vegas Blvd is a good 3 times larger than the teeny one here.\n\nI think each outlet mall serves a certain purpose, but when I am just in the mood for window-shopping and the weather permits, this is where I head.
