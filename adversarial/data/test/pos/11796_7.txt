Famous Toastery has great ratings, so this will be the minority report. First thing's first - service was good. The staff worked as a team, but was Luke warm with its friendly level. Also, we sat and talked for a Long time and no one rushed us, granted I think they were about to close.\n\nThe food was not \"bad\", but it was okay at best. I just wanted a great waffle with strawberries. Been having a taste for it ever since my experience elsewhere. What I got was a doughy waffle with a couple of previously frozen (ewwww, Gross) strawberries and blueberries in one quadrant of the waffle over cheap whipped cream that was melted upon delivery. They didn't even put the powdered sugar over the entire waffle. Pitiful and half hearted effort from the chef. The actual waffle was one step up from Leggo my eggo.\n\nLast, the dishes were sanitized, but not clean. You know how the dishwasher can do a bad job, leaving stuck on food particles? That was the case here. There was egg on my plate, spots on my silverware, and foreign objects in my water that had no ice and tasted poorly.\n\nLong story short, I will not be returning here. Not sure what they're Famous for, but the food can't be it.
