I would tell anyone and everyone NOT to go to this salon. The manager, Sal Jr. was incredibly rude: when I ran into a problem, I believe his statement to the problem was \"this is not McDonald's; it's not have it your way\". This is very unprofessional. \n\nAnyway, I am extremely disappointed in how my hair came out. I went in for a chemical treatment and the stylist didn't know what he was doing. He did not oil my scalp, he didn't section my hair. This caused the bottom part of my hair to be processed but not the top. When it came to blow drying and flat-ironning my hair, the stylist again did not section my hair. This caused my hair to be extremely frizzy. Less than 10 mins after leaving, my hair was a fizzy ball. When I called to complain, the manager had the gall to tell me that it's my fault that it took the stylist over 2 hours to do a blow-out (normally, it take 20-30 mins). \n\nI asked for a refund and the response was rude, unprofessional, and unusual for a hair salon: reputable salons normally stand behind their work. If there is an issue, they normally refund the client. \n\nNever go to this place, it is not worth the headache.\n\n*** UPDATE***\n\nThis is in response to the hair salon's comments:\n\nFact: this is not slander. Fact: a business is responsible for what it's staff does and says. Fact: you never mentioned anything about results being dependent on products used during our phone conversation. Fact: the stylist didn't follow the directions on the packaging; there was two set of directions, one for processed hair one for unprocessed. If you read the whole sheet and don't pick and choose directions, then you'd see that the bottom says 15-20 mins.Fact: the bottom of my hair is processed and not the top. Fact: my blowout was frizzy 10 mins later. \n\nWhy should I be confident in better results when the last time it came out horribly and you and Sal Jr. have been rude? If possible, I'd like to resolve this over the phone. Feel free to call.\n\n*** UPDATE 2***\n\nThis is in response to another set of comments from the hair salon:\n\nIt is unsettling, unprofessional to erase your previous comments. If you truly stand behind your work, your salon, and your policy, you should need to change your comments 3 times. \n\nMoreover, if you really believed in your work, you wouldn't have erase the picture of how AWFUL my hair came out. It's called accountability and your salon doesn't seem to like it. \n\nIn terms of over directing your stylist: your stylist couldn't do a basic sectioning of hair. I will not allow someone to do whatever they please to my hair and not give input, especially since chemical treatments can seriously damage your hair. This is especially poignant because your salon attacks unsatisfied costumers instead of actually helping them and making them comfortable. \n\nIn terms of charges: show me a reputable salon in the Pittsburgh area (or even NYC) that charges $60 an hour for a chemical service. This is ridiculous and absurd to even claim that salons charge that much on average. Again, my family is in the cosmetology business and I grew up in some of the best salons in the NYC area. No one charges that much for a relaxer. \n\nAs far as the directions on the box\/ sheet: again if you do not cherry pick information, as I said before and said to the stylist, I wanted a textured look, not straight. The directions state for unprocessed hair, if you desire a textured look, leave the product on for 15-20 mins. \n\nIf anyone is interested seeing the total lack of quality Puccini's \"guarantees\", please feel free to see the following pictures: https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/106819075532036421969\/posts\n\nMy face has been blurred out because the only relevant part of the picture is how horrible my hair turned out.
