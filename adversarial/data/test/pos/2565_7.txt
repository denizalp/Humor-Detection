Went to redeem a gaming\/dining promo of $10 slot play for paying cash for a $10 lunch. Sounds like a great deal!\nThe shrimp dish from the $10 lunch menu I ordered was covered in the diablo sauce, and it was just way too much. I tasted it and knew that even being a spicy food fan, my stomach couldn't take that much diablo sauce! Or my colon, for crying out loud!\nI asked for a manager and found out they would try to find one. Instead, one of the chefs came out. I explained my plight and he didn't agree with me. No apology, just an attitude. His \"explanation\" was that it's diablo sauce. Well, duh. That doesn't make it OK to pour it on!\nI'm no Gordon Ramsay, but I know when they screwed up! \nSo that was returned, and I had the chicken enchiladas instead, which were so yummy! \nSad and so unprofessional. Hopefully an apology is forthcoming for basically telling me to eff off (if I could have read his mind) because I dared to complain about their crappy dish!
