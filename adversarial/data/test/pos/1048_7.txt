I was really excited about coming here, especially since they have vegetarian options. Unfortunately, I didn't even get the chance to eat... :( while ordering the cashier was SO rude & laughed at me while I asked a question. So I said never mind. I sat there & watched someone eat. What a pleasant experience. No apology either. Not coming back.
