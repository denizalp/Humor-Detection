I first peeked in through the window of Spice while walking out of Happy Dog and immediately put it on my bucket list. But this view really doesn't do the interior justice: you don't get the warm glow of natural light melting with the bulbs, the open but still cozy rooms, the fresh blooms on the tables. It's surprisingly spacious inside and tucked away in the back is a patio - one of two places at which you can take advantage of Happy Hour deals (4-7pm), the other being the bar. \n\nWe made reservations for three on a Thursday night but I think we would have been fine without them. Here you can yourself without being crushed by the crowds of W 25th or E 4th, or worry about accidentally bumping shoulders with your coworker trying to squeeze through tables. You can even park in the back parking lot - for FREE! The staff was professional and a tad too eager to check in on us and offer more menu items, but helpful as we navigated the menu. Probably not the best to bring the kids though, as I could easily see judgment creeping into their eyes while watching a rambunctious child.\n\nKnowing we were heading to Sweet Moses down the street later, and also wincing a little at the pricing, we split several appetizers. The Polenta Chickpea Fries were hearty and tasty, with or without the not so spicy remoulade sauce. We had to take videos of the breaking of the poached eggs on our Daily Flatbread, which similarly satisfied. Their bacon has a bit of sweet smokiness that's not to be missed if you eat meat! But the group favorite was the Roasted Corn Agnolotti: thick, buttery agnolotti pockets stuffed with an airy corn and cheese mash and baked, atop a fresh salad sprinkled with crispy bits of baked cheese that even I, a self-proclaimed cheese-disliker, enjoyed. I had to exercise extreme control to not eat all two agnolotti myself... \n\nEnough with the food Helen! Tell me about the DRINKS. Well. Unfortunately I can only tell you that the cocktail list very much piqued my interest, but that I had to settle for a beer from their extensive list. Spice was offering a Ros√© flight the week we went there, and I'm sure more delectable deals are on the way.
