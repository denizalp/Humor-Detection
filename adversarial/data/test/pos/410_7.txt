Was extremely disappointed with the service (lack thereof) and the attitude of the owner-man--he is the short dude with the white curly hair.  Wanted to inquire whether they sold Delsey expandable spinners but owner-man couldn't be bothered to give us the time of day--other than to evil eye us for touching the merchandise. We took our business elsewhere and found the exact case we were looking for at The Bay on sale at 40% off.  Very rude man with a nasty disposition.  It's a head shaker how this place has managed to stay in business for so long.
