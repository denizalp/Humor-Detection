Interesting spot to hide from the busier bars of downtown and grab an intimate, late night drink. I've known about this Rum Bar for years, but because so many places I care about keep closing down, I decided a couple of weeks ago that I'd stop taking it for granted and dive in.\n\nIf you come here at night, expect the most clandestine vibes. When you take your seat at the bar, it will feel as though you should whisper your order. You can start with something bright, like a rum punch that changes daily. You might not know what's in it, but you know it will be palatable. I needed something stiff. I went with The Garrison, with a nice, heavy, BURNT stick of cinnamon, as well as a tobacco tincture. It was tough. It took a while to finish. It put hair on my chest! But I can dig it. \n\nOn your way out, you can purchase a cigar to chase your spirits after a long night. I quit smoking, but I like the idea. Feels a little noir, come to think of it. I don't see myself as a regular here, but I like it as a cozy little corner for when I want something different.
