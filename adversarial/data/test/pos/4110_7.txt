This place is amazing! It's got a great view of the strip and deliciously fresh fish. The first time I came here, I ended up going on their anniversary so we got a free bottle of their house sake! It was divine. \n\nThe prices are fair especially for how good it is and the staff has always been accommodating and sweet. \n\nJapanese lasagna and Grand Canyon roll are my faves!
