We stopped in to try them for lunch. I am glad we did!  \n\nWe were greeted immediately by the very friendly lady behind the counter.  She was over to get our drink order as we looked over the menu.   Everything she did, she did with a smile.  Our drinks were brought out quickly as was our lunch order.  They have great lunch specials that come with soup, rice and a crab rangoon.  Yum.  \n\nI had ordered the shrimp and broccoli with the brown rice. The shrimp were large and the broccoli was steamed to perfection.  Delicious.  The wonton soup that accompanied my meal was also fabulous.  Great flavor in everything I ate.  \n\nThere is plenty of parking all around and their quaint little restaurant was very clean.  I was happy to finally try them! Thanks NY Chinese!
