I am shocked to have experienced insult after being declined to purchase an iced tea drink. I don't know what triggered his snarky remarks and discrimination, when all I did was walked in to order a beverage. \n\nWhat's noted on your establishment and what's was visible on your counter of To-Go\/ Take-Out orders must not be a clear information. Just by your demeanor of rude and discriminatory antics, it was clear of your racist behavior. \n\nYou must be mistaken; I was yelling at you? That's preposterous of you to state that. Only you; the narrow minded had acted in disgrace! You had caught me off guard with your actions, I didn't have the chance to talk back. My jaw dropped to have experienced racism and it's 2018.\n\nAs I walked out dumbfounded of what I just experienced, I was observant enough to noticed that all the people he was serving are white people. After recollecting the insult he stated to me; there is no doubt that the French accent, bald headed guy with eyeglasses is racist and only does selective services. For the note: French accent is a descriptions not an insult. \n\nI will not recommend this place to anyone. No one should be supporting a business with no moral principle! Browse through  and read all the 1 stars on Yelp or other review sites about Chez Vous owner Fred C. ; you can determine what kind of person Fred C is from all of his response. HE IS COMPLETELY RUDE, RACIST AND UNAPOLOGETIC! \n\nI'm glad I did not waste my money with a poorly managed and disgraceful owner. \n\nFred you must be tone deaf to my statement of your poor management, rude and racist behavior. Your response is irrational in regards to your issues. What you wrote were bunch of excuses. Have some self awareness of your actions! \n\nPerhaps you should consider taking class in Business Management while your at it take Anger Management course! \n\nBest of luck to you!
