I may never win the lottery but having JinJu Chocolates just 2 miles from my house is a close as I may ever get and that's OK.  This true Vegas Gem is run by owner Jin who worked her way up through the strip to now owning her own amazing business.  Her dedication, hard work and tenacity shows in JinJu's tasty creations. \n   I have tried so many of their delicious treats and I love them all!  I love the truffles and to say which one is my favorite is a silly question as they all are my favorite.  They look as amazing as they taste - edible art!  I also really enjoy the chocolates with any kind of nuts.  They are all awesome.  The quality of the chocolate is what makes them so delectable.  I have also had a few of the chocolate bars and they were also amazing.  \n    They are at the end of a small mini mall and have plenty of parking. This location is very nice and roomy inside.  With all that yummy chocolate displayed in front of you as you walk in is so inviting.  The inside is so well decorated and makes you want to sit down and enjoy one of their tasty coffees and a yummy chocolate almond croissant.  Their customer service is great - super friendly and always helpful.  I look forward to enjoying more of JinJu's delicious chocolates soon!  If you are a chocolate lover and haven't been to JinJu's yet you are truly missing out.  Thanks JinJu's for coming to the SW!!!
