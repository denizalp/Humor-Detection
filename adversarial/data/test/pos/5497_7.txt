This place is one POPULAR and PACKED breakfast spot on weekends that's for sure.\n\nAlthough they were super busy and packed the one weekend day we showed up, we were seated immediately near the back where the patio seating is. \n\nI ordered one of their scrambles I believe and I got the banana bread on the side as well. Banana bread was seriously super moist and very buttery. I loved it!\n\nService was very friendly and efficient. \n\nPricing is obviously very affordable being that it's off The Strip. Once again, we love eating where the locals eat. Best bang for your buck fo sho! Thanks Vegas Yelpers for helping us find this decent breakfast joint.
