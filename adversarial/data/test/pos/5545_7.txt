Over-hyped crappy dinner food!  Calling all counterculture weirdo's, here is your culinary Mecca. \nI'll break this down in three sections:\n\nFOOD: I've tried several things on the menu and have to say it all tastes really generic. You think they would have some ham hocks in their collards? Nope! Even the fired pickles that people go nuts for are just out of the jar pickles you or I could buy and make. Burgers are meh. Their french fries are crinkle cut fried, which I find are the worst kind of fry. Reminds me of terrible cafeteria food I ate in grade school. Drinks are overpriced unless you came to drink Tall-boy Pabst Blue Ribbon.\n\nSERVICE: 98% Chance are you will be served by an apathetic hipster with either facial piercings or covered in tattoos. The service has always been slow. I can't blame it completely on the wait staff, it could be that the food coming out of the kitchen is slow. Regardless, be ready to ask for refills if you want them.\n\nATMOSPHERE: If you are looking for a dumpy dive-bar were you can probably score some hepatitis C from the bathroom, then you hit the jackpot. There is a jukebox which has some interesting selection on it. Old floors and beat-up tables and booths. This place could use more than just a fresh coat of paint, but it seems like the regulars love the dumpy look. Speaking of the regulars, these people have more ink than a comic book convention.\n\nBottomline: Service is slow, Food is underwhelming to poor and Atmosphere is unclean. Consider traveling here only after being drunk.
