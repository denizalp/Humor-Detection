A short drive from the strip, Capo's is totally worth leaving the bright lights and drunken frat boys stumbling down Las Vegas Boulevard. Go West on Tropicana and you're there in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe beauty is in the details at Capo's. When you arrive, you walk into a small vestibule. Soon, a small window slides open and a slightly frightening italian man asks what you want. If you manage to convince him you deserve entrance (don't worry- you will), he disappears, only to reappear shortly thereafter to open the door wide, allowing you into the dimly lit restaurant. The chairs and booths are comfortable. The music is fun and often sung by a guy trying for all his might to be Sinatra. Old ganster movies such as the OG Ocean's 11 are playing on a large flatscreen above the bar. The walls are decorated with pictures of infamous mobsters and the boothes are all red velvet and leather.\n\nThe food. My. God. The. Food. Take a lactaide before you get there- these people are serious about cheese. And garlic. This is everything you love but know you shouldn't about Italian cusine. I highly recommend the bruschetta (a beautiful harmony of tomatoes, onion and pesto with a bit of a kick) and \"The Chef Sleeps with da Fishes\" (an alfredo dish with at least a dozen large, tender shirmp swimming in creamy cheesey goodness). \n\nThis is a great place for groups and families. We had a party of 25 including 5 children and 4 teenagers. Everyone LOVED both the food and the ambiance. There was another large group of about 20 and we had absolutely NO problem with service. Everyone was very attentive with the doorman, waiter, busboy and party planner all coming by to make sure everyone was taken care of. \n\nThe skinny:\nCredit cards are accepted.\nEntrees range from $10.50 for spaghetti w\/ meatballs to $25 for specialty dishes\nSeveral desserts are available for about $7 each\nFull bar and good wine selection available\nReservations are HIGHLY recommended as the place is not big\n\n**Important note: If you have a group of 15 or more you will have to have a set menu, where everyone pays the same price, starting at about $35 p\/p. Children under ten are half price.
