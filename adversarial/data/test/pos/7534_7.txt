On our way to Chino Bandido, we passed Two Hippies Beach House (photo: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA?select=-KIBVG11wjL2YuGn5nsNaA). Ever fans of Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, we screeched to a halt and piled on into the restaurant. \n\nWhy would a couple of California-born-and-raised kids like my boyfriend and I want something from a \"beach house\" in the middle of the Sonoran Desert? We had faith in Two Hippies. Plus it's Baja-style, in the middle of Sonora-style country. Let's do this! \n\nThe main entrees are tacos and hot dogs, with \"burros\" also being a dining option. Tacos run $3 apiece, but you can get three for $6. Filling options are: red beef, green beef, carne asada, chicken, fish, cactus, pork, black bean, or pinto bean. \n\nBurros, which are actually pretty huge (we're talking original Green Burrito's Big Ed-sized), cost $6 and have the same filling options as tacos. Tacos and burros come with cabbage, onion, tomato, pinto beans, rice, and cheese. My boyfriend got a burro with green beef and could barely finish it. \n\nHot dogs go for $3-5, they're all numbered and come with a bag of chips (though that's not mentioned on the menu). Just a regular hot dog on a bun is $3, but I felt the biggest bang for my buck was #4 -- pesto mayo, onion, tomato, feta cheese, and bacon for $4. Other hot dogs come with beef chili, jalapeno, guacamole, pinto beans, and the usual assortment of condiments. \n\nIt was pretty good, especially at the price I paid for it. It's comparable to Pink's in Hollywood, actually (definitely better than the Knott's Berry Farm branch, I can tell you that right now). \n\nOur grub: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA?select=3a-7JBtNWFZA9paBD0cBdA\n\nJust like Magic Mushroom, this Two Hippies restaurant sells flavored lemonade for $3 (there's a very long list of flavors taped to the counter). I'd previously tried Prickly Pear (Beach House calls it \"Desert Pear\") and LOVED it, but wanted to try something else. The nice guy taking our order then mentioned some combinations he and the other guys working there made up. I don't remember the names and combos of the others, but I got the one he called \"Yummy in Your Tummy,\" which was a tropical blend of banana, kiwi, and other fruits, and it was GREAT. It came with an orange wedge inside and a little umbrella poked into the lid.   \n\nMy boyfriend got the cinnamon-flavored lemonade since it sounded so out there, and it was actually pretty good. I would have expected it might have gotten spicy to drink after a while, but he says it didn't. \n\nOutside of lemonade, they've got Chai tea ($3) and cans of soda ($1). If you're not digging hots dogs, tacos, and burritos, the only other thing they got is a quesadilla ($3\/cheese, $5\/chicken with guac and sour cream). \n\nThere's only patio seating since the lobby in front of the counter is so tight (packed mostly with random objects in keeping with the ambiance). It was a nice breezy day and Queen's \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" came on the loud speaker. \n\nYeah, we definitely had a nice meal.
