There is bowling here. It's not bad, enough space for the families to sit around and hang out. The downfall, there was no one working at the bar within the bowling area. Made it difficult for everyone to look after their belongings and children while ordering food and drinks. lol. Enjoy the ugly neon shoes.  \n\nI did however like the pretzels with spicy cheese dip. \n\nHighlight: the photobooth.  Spend forever personalizing your photos.  Fun!
