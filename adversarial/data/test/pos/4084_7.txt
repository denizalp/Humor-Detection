Stopped in on Monday for a late breakfast. Hostess was fantastic, as was the food. \nThere were only 2 tables taken in the restaurant at the time we arrived. Waitress only came by twice, and then gave us the bill. She was nice, but basically the hostess helped us, got us more jam, Ketchup, and asked if there was anything else we needed. We were done eating when our waitress appeared with a coffee pot. I could see if it was busy but I couldn't even see her never mind finding her.\nSo a big thank you to the hostess and the chef's as our meal was fantastic.
