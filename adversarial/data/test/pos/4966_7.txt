Yep! Taco Bell is my go to fast food restaurant. I just can't resist a chalupa supreme and oh how I prefer them so much more than Del Taco. Usually your to go orders are correct and they never skimp on sauce and napkins. I love that. Hate how other fast food restaurants don't supply those things unless you ask or are stingy with their napkins. \n\nThis location is pretty good. Today they forgot one of our tacos and that was disappointing. Yes, it was only a $1 taco but who doesn't want their order to be correct? Plus the drive thru attendant wasn't very friendly and was a bit weird. He asked to see our ID with the credit card, totally understandable, but then meticulously checked the ID to a point where it felt like he thought we were thieves. Usually a quick check of name on the ID and a photo comparison does the trick but nope he did more than that. Just strange. Didn't help that he didn't use this meticulousness to check our order for correctness. Yeah, I'll probably be back because I love me some Taco Bell but I'll probably double check my order next time around.
