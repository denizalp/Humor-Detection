I have died and went to WING HEAVEN!!!! No doubt the best wings I have had !! Hubby and I were on our way to get a friend when she was running late and boy I am happy she was! We stopped and thought lets get a bite to eat and try something new, We ordered 15 wings, 1\/2 Cajun & 1\/2 Garlic Parm, with an order of Sweet Potato Fries...\nThe time to get our food was a little longer than I liked but after tasting them I see why it takes time for perfection..I won't complain..after we were almost done eating a gentleman stopped at out table and asked how we liked it, we told him how wonderful it was, he said don't leave I have dessert for you...I was thinking so sweet that was, then he brought these little balls of heaven to our table along with the powder sugar & cinnamon & honey.. OMG they were melt in your mouth delish!!!! I could have eaten dozens!\nThey have soda by the can but they do sell Kool-Aid on tap...I thought that was a great idea\n\nTo say the least I think they have the best wings, service and honey balls.. YOU gotta try this place! I know I will be a regular!
