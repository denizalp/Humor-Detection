With respect to your rebuttal regarding my initial review: are you seriously attempting to encourage me to assign blame to a 3rd party provider (i.e. E-bay) to rationalize your lack of professionalism and non existent customer service skills?  You. Sir, are a joke and a complete idiot if you think, for a second, that I agree with anything you stated...or would support ANYTHING written within your response.  \"Ebay\" was not the vendor that 1. The vendor selling the item that I agreed to purchase 2. \"Ebay\"  did NOT Advertise 1 thing but shipped something else of INFERIOR quality to me.  2. \"Ebay\" was not the vendor who REFUSED to engage me in a courteous, or at the very minimum...a Civil...conversation which should have began with your mgr willingly identifying himself, at the beginning of the phone conversation, as I politely requested  (and I use those terms cautiously\/thoughtfully).  3. \"Ebay\" was not the vendor that used foul language (i.e. curse words\/street vernacular) AND displayed a belligerent attitude; AND finally,  4.  \"Ebay\" was not the vendor that felt empowered (as IF it were a part of his God given rights and privileges) \"to slam the phone down, in my face, during the middle of our \"so-called\" conversation!! That is 1 of THE rudest acts that any so called business\/salesman can do to a potential\/ current customer and is 1 of THE quickest ways to not only ensure you will NOT receive ANY repeat business (from ME) but more than ensure MY status as a now \"former customer\"  that has the time and inclination to go out of MY way to contact \"the powers that be\"...(i.e. the BBB better business bureau)....AND ALSO current and ANY potential future clients to WARN them and plead with them to NEVER patronize this business, since Mgmt has no problem with treating their customers like sh√∑%, with ease!!\nAgain , to everyone that has invested their time and energy into reading this rebuttal to my initial review...I, 1,000% stand by every word, every phrase, and EVERY sentiment,  I initially posted, as it pertains to this jeweler and his lack of business acumen and inability\/unwillingness to satisfy his customers and promptly right a wrong, with minimal to no fuss since NO fuss was warranted regarding this transaction!! He PROMPTLY accepted my payment for the INFERIOR piece of junk he sold to me.\n I only expected him to honor his part of our contract, and promptly refund the money I paid for a item that certainly was NOT useable for its' intended purpose (e.g. it was meant to be a 14kt gold charm to hang from a 14kt gold chain already in my posession).\nDo not shop with this vendor!!!
