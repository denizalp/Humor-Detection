I was always aware of this place, but frankly, some poor Yelp reviews and a mediocre rating kept me away.  My girlfriend and I went to Distrito during AZ Restaurant Week. We liked the menu offered, so what the hell?\n\nIn short, we loved it.  Two of the biggest complaints about this place on Yelp are decor\/ambiance and portion sizes.  \n\nDecor - clean.  Maybe it was too early, but no techno blaring in the background.  So I know what you're thinking...that will warrant some bad reviews in the 'dale.  \n\nPortion sizes - yes, you are not at Denny's or Golden Corral.  The portions resemble a more European offering, as most of the food is pretty rich.  Neither of us left hungry.\n\nIf you enjoy spicy, a little of the habenero agave in your margarita is key.  The Pollito a la Yucateca was fantastic.
