Well, I've lived in Toronto my whole life, and I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 3 years, and I just finally made it to Banh Mi Boys.  \n\nHave you ever seen the Futurama episode where everyone has that glooby globy thing attached to their heads, and it sucks at their brains, and makes them zombie-followers?  No offense to the tastebuds of all the Yelpers I love, but I felt like that at Banh Mi Boys.  I felt like the only one without the glooby globy on my head.\n\nI had the pork belly bao.  It's interesting, because I've had the pork buns at Noodle Bar, and I have only read very mixed reviews about them on here.  But to me, they were leaps and bounds better than what I got at Banh Mi.  The bao was falling apart, the pork belly wasn't soft and buttery, but hard and charred, and (admittedly, I'm a cilantro hater so I had it without cilantro!) the topping seemed to not go so well with the rest of the tastes?\n\nThe bathrooms were beyond gross, you could smell them from a top the stairs...\n\nSo why 3 stars? Well, I could see promise.  I could almost taste the Kool-Aid, and I finished up my bao, so it wasn't terrible.  But I need a revisit for my final decision.
