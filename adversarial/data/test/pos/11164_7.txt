Stopped here for lunch and was immediately enticed by their grilled cheese on the menu. Sad to say that this sandwich was the epitome of mediocrity despite how beautiful it looked. But looks deceived. A lot. \n\nThere was a slice of ham between many of layers of cheese on a think piece of grainy bread. The top slice of bread had more cheese and herbs on it with a slice of sun dried tomato (maybe a regular tomato?) in the middle. The problem with the sandwich was that it wasn't prepared fresh. It tasted like it had been reheated after sitting in the fridge for a few days. Also, the cheese between the bread had not melted in the least. Now because I was in a hurry, I didn't have time to ask for it to be further heated and instead dealt with the dryer than should be sandwich. \n\nThe one redeeming quality was the coffee, which hit the spot and had great flavour.\n\nThe reviewer who called this place confused  nailed it.
