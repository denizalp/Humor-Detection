I tried Leslie's Nail Spa last month because of the Yelp Reviews and location. As we all know, you don't go to just any nail salon unless you want an infection or ugly nails. This is my second visit and I got a very nice pedicure as well as a fill and nail design. Johnny is the best I've ever had with acrylics so far in my twenty years of getting my nails done. He does them thin and shapes them perfectly the first time. I had no issues with lifting either. For basic designs, excellent quality, good prices, and friendly people, they are the best. I will continue to come here.
