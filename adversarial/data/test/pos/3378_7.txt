The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas Nevada\" sign is iconic, so much so it's literally in Paradise. It's as definitive and iconic as the Golden Gate bridge, the Hollywood sign, Milton-Freewater's  (Oregon) \"Home of Low Cost Utilities\" sign and the Sandia Peak tram. It defines the place. \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" reflects the city's character- it looks cheap, tacky, loud.. and who'd want it any different? It's got its own parking lot; people do wait in line to see it, like an object of pilgrimage. It attracts wedding parties, Elvises, you name it.\n\nIt's the setting of this scene in Neil Breen's \"I am Here....Now\"- https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bWAdRtT0pNI A dying cancer sufferer makes a final pilgrimage to behold the Welcome to Las Vegas sign; it's been the goal of his life. It's the plot point. When a bully overturns his wheelchair, Neil Breen as Cyber-Jesus counsels, \"It's just not right.\"\n\"I am Here....Now\" is kind of a quasi-metaphysical ode to Las Vegas, the Strip, and eco-sustainable living- https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t5rtIrQK_Ik\nIt's a vision of Vegas, like you've never seen it before- https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eE3-sxaOJDo\n\nThe Welcome to Las Vegas sign beckons. It's an oasis of sorts upon the Strip. Since it dates back to 1959 and has its own distinct Pop Art style, it's now a National Historic Landmark. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, since this wouldn't fit in any other place, and we wouldn't want it any other way.
