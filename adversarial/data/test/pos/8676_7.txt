Do not go to this dealership!!!\n\nI went here prepared to purchase a 2015 Range Rover Sport but was told they only had 1 at the dealership and that I could not test drive it unless I was serious about buying it. How does a serious buyer look?  \n\nWas I wearing the wrong clothing. Did my 2014 BMW 740 Li scare them away?  I asked them if they were serious about selling it and walked out. \n\nNeedless to say, my experience with Chandler BMW was much better last year. I went across the street to Mercedes and had a very pleasing, civil experience there with Roger. \n\nPoor service is obviously how Range Rover operates. \n\nMy last few vehicles were a Lexus, Porsche and BMW. Hmmmm, wonder if Range Rover would like to be next...not happening.
