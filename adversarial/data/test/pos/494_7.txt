Ok so one thing is definately clear about this place... they are true to their name. If you go to some of the other places around here they basically DROWN their meats in whatever they claim to be the \"best bbq sauce ever\", where at Rick's he just lets the smoker do the talking for him and lets you have your sauces on the side, this is a much better way to enjoy bbq, and the pulled pork is amazzzzzinnnng... buy it by itself and just add buns to the order... bring it home, and make yourself a pulled pork sandwich.... mmmm... I just slather mayo on the bun , put the pork in there and go to town.... thats how we do!
