Very nice on the inside!  New, fresh and clean.  The pricing however is another story.  It has pricing close to what it reminds me of and that is RTO Sullivans.  RTO's left the area but I don't think O'Briens can just move in it's place w\/out a lil work.  They have NO happy hour or specials....FAIL!  The staff is extremely unprepared and little knowledge of the menu.  It's just lil things like serving you a sample of soup without a spoon to eat it with.  I had a couple beers, 1\/2 sandwich\/soup (Potato soup sucks) and my bill was $25.  Sorry Toto but we're in WEST Mesa now so good luck surviving with the current pricing and NO specials!  I think this place will be closed in a year or less.
