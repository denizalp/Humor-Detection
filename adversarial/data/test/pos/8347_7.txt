\"Ode to the salad\"\nTwo words: In-vogue. \nDelectable burgers, Exceptional Salad... When you think Burger, the first thing that comes to mind is a hands-on, unpolished, All-American type of fare. Delux is the sheik fashionista of the burger world. \n\nExcellent brew selection: \"beer flights\" are amazing. \n\nYou can't go wrong with a Delux Burger, but that isn't what keeps me coming back folks. Are you ready for this? SALAD. That's right, salad. \nYou're probably thinking, \"Wow this guy gets a salad at a burger joint\" but I ensure you, The DELUX CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD will change your life. It reduced me to a confused, pathetic, blubbering oaf for days, maybe weeks until I returned for another. If you must have a burger, PLEASE, do yourself a favor and get the Chinese chicken salad on the side (but be warned, its siren call can tame the most pompous of meat loving men.)\n\nAnd remember to get a basket of \"MIXED FRIES\", that way; you can try both the sweet potato and regular. Together, they're an unstoppable force of dynamic excellence.\nOne of my favorite late night dinner stops.\nEat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers
