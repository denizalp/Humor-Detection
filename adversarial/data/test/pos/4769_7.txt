Such a mixed bag that it's hard to pick the right number of stars. I bounced between 2 and 3 but I hate dissing small biz, so went for the 3.\n\nFirst, we arrived to find a mostly empty restaurant. They tried to seat us at a two-person table, but my love and I prefer to sit next to each other so we asked for a bigger table and gave the reason why.\n\n\"Oh, we are expecting a reservation. I have to check.\"\n\nI'm looking around the mostly empty room and wondering if \"A\" reservation is some herd of people....\n\nAfter conferring with the owner, he reseats us at a table that is a fire code violation (half way blocking a door), and starts to clear away the place settings that would allow us to sit next to each other (though I mentioned it to him before we were seated.)\n\nHe seems stressed. I whisper to my BF that maybe he'd just been yelled at or perhaps the owner threatened to chop his head off.\n\nThe martini menu is probably 7 or 8pt font size and the headings are brown on beige. If you are older than 30, it's most likely entirely illegible. It made me a little bit cranky. Common sense says.....make your menu readable. I walked it to a brighter area and picked a martini that ended up tasting a bit like a gym locker. $10 too. :-(\n\nWe came for tapas but the closest thing was under \"Appetizers.\" Again, brown on beige but at least the font size was a bit bigger. But I bet my parents would have a hard time reading the menu.\n\nThe food ranged from ok to really good and maybe even awesome. But the initial experience was so off putting and the menu thing aggravated me. And the bill was expensive. And my bf's martini didn't taste like a gym locker, but it was odd and not very tasty and it's supposed to be MARTINI bar.\n\nDoubtful I'd go back again, but obviously, other people love it.
