It won't suprise any of you to find out that I have been to the southern united states of america.  I don't go often, after the unplesantness in 1775, I simply don't feel welcome, but I do enjoy a spot of southern music from time to time.  My experiences are often just fine at the Dakota Tavern, located under a portugese sports bar; but this time the nerve of the young wench at the bar!  Ignoring Horace W. Mayweather is inexcusable!  Not only did she ignore me, but also my lady companion, went to the other end of the bar to serve others, and passed over us again to put away glasses.  I know they aren't as busy since the musical combo 'the beauties' don't play anymore, but therefore the service should be faster!  Rude Service is the first and last straw for a man such as myself.  We left, got back out cover charge, and had a lovely glass of Sherry at the Crooked Star.  For shame Dakota!  Bravo Crooked Star!\n\nToodle-Loo!\n\nHM
