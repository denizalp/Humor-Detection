I dig this joint. They feature the Chemex brewing method, which is rad. Plus Intelligentsia beans can't be beat. They're a scosh light on the seating, and outlets can be hard to come by. But you don't get this hip by emulating Starbucks. The baristas are all super friendly, and they even know what they're doing! What a revelation! In a college town, the fact that so many craptastic cafes with terrible baristas exist is beyond my comprehension; but JPH nails it. \n\nAnd one last thing, what good would a coffeehouse be without internet? These cats have the most reliable internet on the Madison coffee scene. Hands down. Best internet. There's nothing I hate more than rolling up on a coffeeshop only to be greeted by an internet connection thats up and down more times than... you fill in whichever metaphor your mind desires... I mean, this isn't 1997, folks. We aren't on \"Friends\". People don't go to coffeeshops to read \"People\" and gossip with each other. We're there to stare at our individual glowing screens and gossip *about* each other in silence.
