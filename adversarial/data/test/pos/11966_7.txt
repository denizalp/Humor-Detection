Wow. If I could give zero stars I would. This place was extremely underwhelming. Me and my lunch companion were walking down east 4th and decided to stop in for a bite. I ordered a happy hour Ceasar salad ($8) and he ordered the *award winning* lamb Burger($13). With only two other patrons at the bar our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately the food runner dropped everything off and never bothered to to ask if we needed anything else. Hmmm.. not sure how I should eat a salad without silverware... as I wait patiently for a bartender (3 of them are behind the bar talking to each other) to come and check on us so I can get a silverware set I stare mystified at our plates. Imagine a romaine heart, with every decent leaf gone, soaked in dressing with some random stuff. So dissappointing. I don't eat much but it was like eating nothing...\n\nMoving on.. finally flag down a bartender (apparently it's not obvious neither of us are eating our food) get some silverware.  The lamb burger looks like a kid meal from Applebee's served on a side plate with burnt house chips that were pretty much up unedible. The bun is a square and clearly from a pull apart bun bag. The burger was the size of a Wendy's junior burger. Now don't get me wrong I know I'm getting a happy hour price burger ($13???) But seriously... \n\nSo after I finish my beer (only 4 beers on tap?) Even though we were clearly done at least 10\/15 minutes before she comes back, to offer me another (never asking how the food actually was?). No thank you. \n\nI don't usually write reviews, especially negative, but i will not be returning and want to save another patron their time and money.
