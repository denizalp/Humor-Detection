I didn't eat here but my idea of \"comfort\" food is different.   I couldn't sit where I wanted \"because we get really busy\"  and was stuck by a utility door because I made the mistake of coming here alone and didn't want to sit at the bar.  They kept getting into the door, which wasn't pleasant.  I looked at the menu and not a burger in sight and some crazy prices. I kid you not.  $12 for mac-n-cheese, $35 for steak, and $20 for chicken and waffles.  The steak sounded awesome, though!  If I could have sat at a nice table, maybe the prices wouldn't be an issue but to charge them and not even being \"comfortable\" and made to feel like coming there as a single person gets me the crappy table.....well, I got up and left.  I can get a better table, gorganzola steak, and not made to feel that being a single diner is an imposition at another restaurant.
