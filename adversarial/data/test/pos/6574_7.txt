just WOW! First, I'll start by saying that I have not even had my painting work done yet.. And I'm already blown away by the professionalism and great communication that has been taking place. Joe was EARLY to our first consult, and had a quote for me the SAME day. The price was great.. and I'm so excited to work with them in a couple weeks! Will update review later on :) \nHighly recommended.\n\nEdit after service was completed.. \nUnfortunately, I have changed my 5 star review to a 1 star review. These guys are the definition of over promising and under delivering.\nYou'll be wow'd by the proposal packet and the ability to provide a quick quote.. You'll probably like Joe at first and think he's a nice man. I did.\n\nI was so very excited (as you can tell from my initial review) to have Extra mile painting come to my house. I had my heart set on a color pallet for about 4 years. I knew exactly what I wanted and where when Joe came to my house for an estimate. I showed him my color scheme- that was the last time we talked about colors until The morning of the job.. More on that later. \n\nJoe had some personal things going on. I patiently waited 3 extra weeks to have the job started.. Like i said, I WANTED these guys because I thought they would do an amazing job. I turned down another painter who was also a handyman, who costed hundreds of dollars less and was going to throw in some other minor repairs my house needed just to have the work done by these guys instead. If I could turn back time.. \n\nSO, fast forward to the day work began. Junior said Joe said I didn't know what colors I wanted. Wrong. I knew for 4 years (no exaggeration) what colors I wanted. So instead of coming prepared to my house with those colors, or even asking me about them ahead of time, I was handed a giant book of colors, seriously wayyyyyy more options that someone would ever need. I think there were probably 5000 colors to choose from.. I needed maybe 5ish. Clearly that was overwhelming... I suppose that's \"Not their fault\" (a reoccurring theme, you'll see)\nNeedless to say I ended up with colors I don't like and that aren't in my scheme.\n\nI trusted Junior and his assistant. We know extra mile painting from a networking group.. So after I was rushed to choose my colors, I left their employees with a key to my house to lock up when they were done in case I wasn't back from work in time. I didn't want them to have to wait for me to get home. \n\nI came home to an absolute sh*t show.. for lack of a better word. \nMy screen door was shut.. The main door to my house was left wide open. I thought maybe it was for air flow... But then I discovered the house was not locked AT ALL. I had also recently bought things for my house including a large TV which I was storing in the front room where the painters left the blinds up so it was in plain view. \nBig deal? maybe not to some. But it was incredibly careless. \nOpen House + Visible things to Steal... I'm LUCKY that didn't happen.\n\nIf you've seen the proposal packet... You'll notice for interior jobs they promise a clean work space every day. \n\nThere was paint on my new flooring, there was paper and plastic everywhere. I was then told that they don't actually clean up each day because it's too expensive and time consuming for them to do so. ok... So don't put that in your proposal. Easy! \n\nThe job took 2.5 days.. Each day I was cleaning up  multiple \"Squirt\" soda bottles from various places in my house.. Apparently Joe's workers have a favorite soda and expect their clients to clean up their un-workrelated garbage. Carelessness again. \n\nOnce the job was finished, I spent the entire next week cleaning paint off of places where paint shouldn't have even been. Light fixtures, kitchen appliances, counter tops tile in the bathrooms. Sure.. It comes off. But the fact of the matter is a company promising cleanliness shouldn't have been so sloppy.\n\nI'm not one to leave a review without having tried to clear things up first.. When I told Joe about my concerns regarding cleanliness, he criticized my housekeeping habits. Stating that \"they didn't have a clean work space to begin with\" and Maybe if I kept a clean home his workers would have been able to see they had left paint behind... \nHe didn't say it once, he kept repeating that as the reason why it was \"Not their fault\" that they were so sloppy. \n\nI'm renovating my house... Obviously it wasn't as clean as it typically would have been. I don't think it was the reason why his workers were so sloppy... And i found it rude and unprofessional that he thinks it would ever be okay to critique the cleanliness of someones house. \n\nThe literally only positive I have is that through all of this I was able to get a $100 discount.. Joe only wanted to give me $50. \n\nJust save yourself the disappointment and hire someone else. Literally anyone else.
