We made a special trek out here for Montreal's supposed best brew pup, only to be told: children not allowed. \n\nMaybe it's a cultural difference, since in my hometown (Philly) the slow, 5-6pm hours are when urban parents like me bring our well-managed kids with us to brewpubs to enjoy a pint and a meal with friends. It's pretty shocking to be told you aren't welcome in an establishment.
