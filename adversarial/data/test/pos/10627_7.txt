The Pizza Kitchen is located on the corner of Hacienda and S.Fort Apache. It is in the Walmart Plaza. Easy to find.\n\nWe arrived there around 6pm for dinner. We were the only people there for a few minutes and then a few more customers cam in. It was not that busy for a Wednesday night at dinner time. You stand in line while they prepare your pizza just like you were at a sandwich shop or a burrito spot. After you pick all of your toppings it goes in the oven and you go sit down. When the pizza is cooked a server brings it to your table.\n\n$8.00 for unlimited toppings is great. They had plenty of fresh toppings to choose from. Unfortunately the were out of whole wheat dough. They lose one star for running out of product. The pizza crust was very thin, so it cooked quickly.\n\nThey also have vegan cheese, meats, and gluten free dough.\n\nOverall the pizza was good, the service was good, and the place looked clean. If your in the area I would stop by and try this place.
