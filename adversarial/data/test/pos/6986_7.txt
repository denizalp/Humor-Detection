This McDonald's puts real flowers on the tables.\n\nWTF.\n\nAND, it's a gas station McDonald's.  It's not even a free-standing McDonald's. Mind=boggled.\n\nAnyways...I never eat at McDonald's but had a hankerin' one morning for hot cakes.  I was a little perplexed walking in, however, because the decor was really modern and...tasteful.  Not what you expect from a McDonald's.  A+ franchisee, A+.\n\nAlso, I learned a great thing, the greatest thing I learned in all of August 2012.  McDonald's now serves dipped cones! And, they're good.  Screw off DQ, I'm going to fancy McDonald's from now on!
