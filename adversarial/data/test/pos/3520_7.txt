What's all the hype???? I will never understand. \n\nUpon arrival to Vegas, two of my friends were so excited about this place, so we ended up going here on our second day for a late lunch. I ordered a regular combo that came with 4 burgers, fries and a drink. They were so unorganized that I ended up with someone else's food, but after standing there for 8 mins I decided to just roll with it. I actually ended up with some little tasty onion crispers instead of fries. Now, I will say that I liked them a lot, but the burgers were exactly like a Krystal burger ( no biggie, nothing major ), it looked like a Krystal & tasted like a Krystal. I later had a tummy ache. There restaurant set up is wide open, so you can see everything going in the kitchen area. \n\n The restaurant dining area was a complete mess, I mean,  if you know you have that much traffic coming thru your restaurant, one would think you would have a clean up staff on duty at all times. \n\nI wasn't impressed, once was enough for me.
