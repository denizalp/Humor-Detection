2.5\n\nIt's a chain restaurant located in a strip mall in a Cleveland suburb. Some things are what they are. When it comes to JGumbos, however, some of those things aren't very good. But, let me start with the positives:\n1.) When you walk in, it looks like a counter-service establishment. But, it's not. You get table service and that helps to elevate the experience and make things a little nicer;\n2.) Speaking of table service, our server, Erin, was fantastic. She was sweet as pie, funny, patient, and incredibly helpful. She gave suggestions, offered samples and helped a group of people decide on what to get. She definitely helped make the experience much more than it could have been;\n3.) HAPPY HOUR AND SUPER BOOZY DRINKS. Yes, JGumbos serves booze (as well as NOLA-styled eatery should). Yes, the drinks are good. Yes, the bartender had a heavy hand. Yes, the drinks come in pint glasses. Yes, the happy hour prices will make you over indulge. Yes, you should have a DD if you come here during happy hour.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe food is awful. Seriously. It's not good. Like, at all. I can't say that anything looked appealing. Most dishes had the appearance of slop on a plate. I'm not even pulling the 'I used to live in New Orleans' card. This was just, objectively, nasty-looking food. If you eat with your eyes, you might go blind from starvation. Wanting to minimize the prospective damage to my stomach but needing something to soak up all the sweet sweet booze in my belly, I decided on the NOLA Nachos. I can hear you laughing. Yes, NOLA Nachos. That says it all. NOLA.Nachos. Some of the highlights: store-bought Tostido chips. Barely solid 'chicken.' Some sort of indistinguishable 'NOLA' sauce. Ugh. I can't write any more. The flashbacks are making me ill.\n\nCome here for happy hour.
