Now that the harmonious repetitive structures of Philip Glass's melodies have faded (I'm sitting here in near-silence actually) and I must review this place more objectively. They're not quite ready for prime time. By which I mean mornings.\n\nI've come here the past two mornings to a \"closed\" sign. While the posted hours, and unlocked door, and staff, and customers inside would indicate that they are open, the sign suggests otherwise. So does the fact that they didn't have espresso going, and only had brewed coffee for the first couple hours of the morning. Not a huge deal for me, but I can see why they're gunshy about flipping that sign around.\n\nActually, they just turned on the radio. Jazz FM. (FML.) That totally cancels out the Steve Reich star.\n\nAll this in concert with the minimum $5 for debit, I really can't proclaim this spot \"as good as it gets.\" My first visit was in the afternoon, so perhaps T.A.N. just isn't a morning person. Let's see what develops.
