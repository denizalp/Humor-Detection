Today was the second time I visited this location and both times, the same lady was vacuuming during open hours. The first time she vacuumed super close to our table. And if you vacuum, you know that the sound can get awfully loud. Today, she asked me to wait so she could finish her vacuuming. I didn't know that business values choose to place vacuuming as a top priority over customer service, but I guess it does here! If you looking for a place where you can hear a loud, obnoxious sound of a vacuum as you eat your bagel, this is the place to be! I guess vacuum white noise is really a thing?\n\nAnd the vacuum is not the worst part, the manager accused me of stealing an orange juice from the shelf! I had purchased a Starbucks drink and placed it on the table before walking myself to the counter to purchase my bagel. When I ordered, I handed the manager a coupon that I had and he asked me if that was all I wanted to order. I said yes. He proceeded to accuse me of not paying for the orange juice I had on the table. I told him it wasn't an orange juice and that it was a Starbucks drink. Some could argue that I shouldn't have brought my drink into the store, but no where did I see a sign for \"no outside drinks or food\" on the door or walls. He did NOT apologize for the choice of words that he used to accuse me with and went on to accept my money. I eventually got a refund because they were out of the bagel that I wanted, but this business is definitely not going to thrive with the level of abysmal customer service values and attitude towards their patrons. I definitely will not be returning and you should not too.
