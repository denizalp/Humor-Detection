I can't tell you how many times I've been flying down Independence Blvd (and by flying, I of course mean driving the safe and comfortable speed limit) and went right by this place without ever giving it a second thought. \n\nYelp led me here a few weeks ago. And then I came back a week later. Fast forward to today, I took my roommate here. To sum it up, I'm three for three in the weeks of September.\n\nThe lunch menu here is a pretty good deal. Most of the meals are less than $6. Today I went with a combination of enchilada and taco. The roomie went arroz con pollo. Huge portions. She took half of hers home for lunch. I accidentally consumed everything on my plate. Gah, I've got to get back into yoga if I keep eating like this. I think our bill was maybe $16 with tax.\n\nThe chips come with both a salsa and a pico slaw type salsa. I recommend mixing the two together. You're welcome.\n\nThe people who work here are really friendly. During my first visit here, one of the waitresses sat and walked me through the menu. So nice. \n\nGetting back on Independence can take some patience. I avoid it and go out a back way. The road dumps you at Sharon Amity. Perfect for me. I just have to take Monroe to make the trek home.\n\nCraving some Mexican and some chips and salsa? This place hits the spot.
