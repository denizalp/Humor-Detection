I really had no issues with E-Z Rent-A-Car.  Their prices were relatively cheap and they're located at the McCarran Rental Car Center.  Service was good and the people that helped me out were really friendly and accommodating.  The only issue I had really was that they didn't have any compact cars ready for me when I arrived.  So to compensate for that, for no charge they upgraded me to a full size car.  Not a bad deal!  Other than that minor issue, the whole process with checking out and returning the car was really easy.  I will definitely consider renting a car from them in the future!
