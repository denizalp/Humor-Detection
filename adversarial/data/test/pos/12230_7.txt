It's Walmart.... my expectations are extremely low already.... but in this particular Walmart... I have asked 3 different employees where the firewood is, and have been told 3 different (incorrect) locations. Finally found a \"manager\".... asked him.... he barely looked up from his phone and said \"yes... I'll show you\" then proceeded to walk slower then a infant crawling for the first time. I asked him to just tell me where and I would walk there myself faster... he refused to tell me, just kept saying, \"no, no... I'll show you.\"\nIt's no wonder Walmart is known as a classless joke
