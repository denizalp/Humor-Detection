Had an awesome experience in the bar yesterday. Had a few cocktails and appetizers. The duck fat fries were great. I cook my potatoes in bacon fat so I was used to a great flavor. What really topped it off was the poached egg on top.\n\nI'm a total whore for an egg on anything.\n\nBrussels sprouts were darn good and so were the potato-bacon-tot things.\n\nSolid old-fashioneds and nice pours all around.\n\nOpen kitchen like I love and the food coming out looked spot on.\n\nFive stars for now. Will review again after I have a meal.\n\nNote that they are not open for lunch on the weekend. BUMMER
