I was very unimpressed with this place. They caused me more stress than the problem I was trying to get help for. First of all, it was not easy to schedule appointments. You have to schedule them with by talking directly to your counsellor, not a receptionist, so you have to play an endless game of phone tag. The first price they quoted me was pretty outrageous, so they told me if I wanted a reduced rate I could see someone who was in training and not yet certified. I decided to take that route so as not to use up all my insurance coverage in 3 visits. So after yet another endless game of phone tag I got an appointment. \nThe location is not ideal - downtown with no parking, so you have to pay to park on the street. I got there and filled out my paperwork and my counsellor finally came and got me, 15 minutes late for our appointment. No reduced rate for a shortened appointment. She was okay, but not very personable. We scheduled another appointment at the end and I went on my way. I arranged childcare for the afternoon of my next appointment. \nOn the morning of the day of my next appointment, I received a call at 10:15 from my counsellor, asking where I was. I told her was sitting at home eating breakfast with my chikdren since my appointment was at 1:00pm. She told me that my appointment was at 10:00 and I was late and asked if I could get there. Yeah, already 15 minutes into the appointment, and I can just find someone to watch my children and get downtown and park and get to the appointment. So she said I would be charged for the missed appointment. I was caught so off-guard that I just told her I'd call back and reschedule. \nWhen I did call back, the receptionist was extremely rude. I wanted to ask her if my insurance would cover the missed appointment fee, but she just kept asking me who my counsellor was and trying to transfer me. She wouldn't even let me ask a question, and at one point when I was saying something I could hear her talking to someone else, so I stopped talking and asked if she was even listening to me. I have never had a receptionist do anything so rude! So finally she told me that yes, my insurance would cover the fee, and then transferred me to my counsellor to reschedule. \nI left a message, and then she called back and left a message saying they won't stamp receipts for missed appointments so no, my insurance wouldn't cover it. I left her another message asking if they could waive the fee, since we didn't know which of us was in the wrong regarding the appointment time. At this point she switched to emails, telling me that I was lucky she was allowing me to reschedule with a balance owing on my account. How incredibly gracious of her! I understand their policy on missed appointments, but if a counsellor calls and I answer and clearly have no idea I'm supposed to be there at that time because I had the appointment for a different time, it seems pretty self-righteous of them to refuse to accept fault for the mistake. One of us was in the wrong, and it seems ridiculous that I should have to pay if we don't know whose mistake it was. She kept saying in her emails to let her know what I wanted to do about our next appointment, which was a pret clear indication I should cancel. After being treated that way by  a counsellor, I don't think they are someone I want to be counselled by! \nSave your time. You might need extra counselling after going to this place.
