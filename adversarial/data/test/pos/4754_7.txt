The Quest for Righteous Skivvies...\n\nI'm a long-time shopper at Target (pronounced \"tar-zhay\", of course), but never have I had so many different storefronts to choose from as when living in the Phoenix metropolitan area. As a matter of a fact, I didn't even know this Target existed until I decided I needed to explore the hidden strip malls and unfamiliar terrain that is Gilbert.\n\nTo no avail, I had already visited two other Targets to find more XL Champion long boxer-briefs, my newest discovery and must-haves for total workout comfort. See, I've always been kind of a fat boy, so my thighs rub together and chafe during sessions on the treadmill or when running. I thought I had conquered this nuisance by wearing compression (yes, spandex) shorts under my workout shorts, but that solution only predicated a new irritation... to my precious man-junk. The spandex shorts I was wearing have a longitudinal seam that acts as a crosscut saw on my satchel. It was becoming a huge deterrent to the frequency of my workouts, as it required a bit of recovery between sessions... and the application of a soothing salve.\n\nTarget to the rescue! This Target store had a decent inventory of the prized undergarments I sought. It must be the superior engineering of the \"tech performance mesh pouch\" that has brought me (and my boys) enhanced comfort and ventilation. With fresh grundies in tow, I am now able to make the following pledge to my scrotum: \"You, who have suffered so much for so long, shall no longer be mistreated by a poorly-engineered garment! For I have spared you from an inevitable shredding, in a cool, dry comfort fit and supportive environment. Never again will you suffer such agony, for the pouch art with you. Amen.\"
