After hearing about them on Bar Rescue I went in with a friend to eat and play some pool. We played 40 minutes of pool and never once did the waitress come get our order. We ended up going to the bar for drinks and had to ask the waitress for a menu. She proceeded to throw it at us and never came to get our order. \n\nI will never patronize this establishment or recommend it to anyone. Beware the waitress with the black and white pants, even after confronting her about her service she just laughed. Horrible.
