WHAT TO TRY?!?\n\nThe Korean fried chicken!! Even the breast meat tastes good. Batter wasn't too thick and there was a crunch to the chicken. I suggest the saucy one may be the better option because the dry rub doesn't have that much taste to it. What you can do is also ask to have the sauce on the side if you want to control how much sauce you want on your chicken! We had the spicy sauce but it wasn't that hot at all. It was tasty though!! For those of you who want spicy, you might not think it's spicy at all so you may ask them to really crank up the spice factor. Pieces are chicken are huge though!!!!\n\nWe ordered other things too like spicy bulgogi in a stone pot which was delicious as well. The pork bone soup was kind of sour with the Kim chi cabbage that they added but it still tasted alright. The perilla seeds are crushed and sprinkled on top of the pork bone soup. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nAn order of chicken will really fill you up. It's pure meat right?! If you want to order more, I suggest ordering a soup because eating too much fried food tends to make one thirsty!! You can order a whole or half chicken and they come in a big pot!!
