Loved this place, went for the first time today after work and WOW. First of all this place looks pretty unique, the interior design, furniture, wooden decks with pillows, tables on second floor, well at least Charlotte doesn't have much unique looking coffee places after Amelie's. They also serve wine and beer and they have a small selection of pastries. We tried the pumpkin croissant and it was delicious ($2 - half price pastries today yay!!) and had Dirty Chai Latte - it was alright. Nice staff, interactive and lots of people were coloring something and having wine today some kind of \"adult coloring and wine\" day I think.  Above all it's the ambience that we would want to go back again.
