My husband is a Firefighter and my Son loves this place. Warning! People who work there are RUDE and real grouchy!! I do not refer people there strictly due to them. I would not want any of my friends to be treated so poorly. I do take my son just because he is so obsessed with anyting to do with Firefighting. I thought about having his birthday party there, sadly due to the staff changed my mind.
