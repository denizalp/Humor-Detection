Just left here not fifteen minutes ago.\n\nOne table of ladies with one rude woman sat next to us. Not the restaurants fault, yet irritating that such people exist.\n\nLemonade to drink, just fine as is.\n\nBrie Brulee 12\n\nQuite uninspired in presentation and the brie was very ordinary, my friends Mer and Mike serve one of much higher quality.\n\nFrench Dip Sandwich 12\n\nThis one was with salad. Another lackluster presentation, but that would have been ok if were good. It was not, or at least to me. \nThe beef was cut too thick and with it being too well done and the gristle made for a tough sandwich with little redeeming flavour.\nIt was left half eaten\n\nChicken Cordon Blue 10\n\nI did not eat this, but Brice told me it was ok if all you were expecting is a chicken and ham sandwich. He did finish.\n\nWe had mentioned we wanted to talk with someone about renting the extra room, or get a card. The wait person said ok after we are done she will send someone out.\nWe did sit a while after we were done; no one came out or was a card offered. But it might have been because I guess I caught her off guard earlier.  \nIn the middle of eating our sandwiches she asked if everything tasted good. I said no, she looked at me as if she did not understand, so I repeated that I did not like my food. Talk about someone's face changing from a smile to a deer caught in the headlights, she stammered and said sorry then ran off. NO question of why I felt displeasure or any thought of remedy. It did give us a chuckle with such lack of attention. But what it also did was make us reconsider if we should even think about the room for a party.\n\nSo once again I am in the minority since no rave from me.\n\nOh yeah and we had to ask for forks. Hahhahhahhah oh well.......
