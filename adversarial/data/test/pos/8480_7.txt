Menchie's is located on Aurora Road, right near Starbucks and across from Market District.\n\nI like Mechie's because they are very upfront about the nutritional values in their yogurts, as documented on the small signs next to the self-serve levers. They also make small tasting samples available for anyone that wants to try something before they commit. Its hard not to love a yogurt place that is well-stocked and has constantly freshly stocked toppings. Whether crushed candies or fresh fruit are your toppings du jour, you can make the frozen yogurt concoction of your dreams to fit any craving.\n\nThe interior of the store is super colorful, inviting and fun. The workers are always very friendly and talkative. I have to give mad props to the staff at this Menchie's. When I was getting my ice cream, I stepped in a weird puddle of some melted yogurt. I then told the high school kid working that I was having a bad day, so OF COURSE I would step in a yogurt puddle, because, life. This kid took pity on my soul and dirty shoes and gave me 20% off my yogurt. When I left, he said, \"Have a smiley day!\" What a doll.
