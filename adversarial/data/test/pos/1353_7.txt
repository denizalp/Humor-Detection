Expensive! No prices on their website or in the restaurant.  $10 per sandwich easy. \n\nI read the previous reviews and thought I'd check it out.  Not good. Edible. Potato salad tastes like they bought it from the grocery store deli. Order was wrong even after I clarified when I picked up and had to wait for my to go order.  There was one person in the place.\n\nWon't be back, it's not gourmet, bad Quiznos at best.
