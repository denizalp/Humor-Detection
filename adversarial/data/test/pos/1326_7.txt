The Bow tower gets 5-stars on account that I'm pretty sure as the sun hits high noon over Calgary, the curvature of The Bow's glass panes focus the solar energy into a point that would vaporize a passing Magpie. It's like an ant and a magnifying glass of Calgary skyline define proportions.  That's just badass.\n\nNot only is it pleasing to look at, have some cool Giant Head art out front and is the tallest tower in Calgary, it's the closest thing the YYC has to a death star.
