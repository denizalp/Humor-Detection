The pizza is great, the owner is rude. Do we go back? Spending our money to be treated with disrespect is enough to wish them out of business.\nThe place is 1\/2 darkened to save light as there's no customers. When the old folks die off, who will they have? \nI say, the attitude there sucks and this could be why they have little business. So if you want some great pizza, get it while you can because when the old timers go, so will they.\nPlace was clean.
