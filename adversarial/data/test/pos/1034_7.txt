I've been on a Yelp frenzy these weeks but i've fallen on bad luck lately. Looking for good pizza tonight I Yelped for pizza in the area we were coming home from. Pizza Villa came up with pretty good reviews and we dropped in and picked up a cheese pizza to go.\n\nThe cheese taste cheap, the sauce just wasn't there, and the bread was doughy everywhere. We each had an entire slice and put it away for now. We'll probably much on it throughout the night...\n\nbad pizza is still pizza and any pizza is good\n\nI'll eat metro pizza before this one next time
