LOVE LOVE LOVE!!\n\nI won't go into too many details, since there are plenty of other reviews to read, but here's the basics:\n\nPros:\n- Located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental - with a great view of the Strip!\n- MO is a 5 Star hotel, so the service is spectacular\n- Large selection of different teas, along with champagne and food\n- Everything is beautifully presented\n\nCons:\n- The space is just too small - there were 8 of us in our party (we had reservations), but they only had place settings for 7 people. They were able to pull up an extra chair, but it was a bit cramped\n- Everyone ordered tea service, so the table became cluttered\/full quickly with the tea pots for all of us\n- This may not be a con for everyone, but MO only offers valet parking (which is complimentary). Also, if you are not familiar with MO, the entrance off LVB is a bit hidden. If you don't want to Valet, you can park in ARIA self parking and it's just a short walk away\n\nOverall, it was a great time. All of the food was magnificent and the tea was amazing (I had the orange blossoms). They even welcomed us with a glass of champagne, since we were celebrating a special occasion. The Chef came out and talked to us and we really felt special. This is really a great treat, but not something I would do often (the tea service is $45 per person). I would totally suggest this if you are looking for a relaxed day with your girlfriends and want to do something different. Plus, there is a great view and the hotel itself is beautiful. \n\nIf you haven't experienced tea service like this, GO!
