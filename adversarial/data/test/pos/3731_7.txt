Sadly Taste Good BBQ does not \"Taste Good\"\n\n$5 for a rice box with 1 protein and tofu or veggie plus soup or bottle water. This is just so cheap and obviously you get what you pay for.\n\nBBQ pork was dry and tasteless, did not taste good at all.\n\nThe store itself was not the cleanliness.\n\n1 star for value\n1 star for friendliness \n0 star for food
