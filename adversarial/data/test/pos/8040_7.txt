The only other \"pod\" Ferris Wheel I had been on before was the Millennium Wheel (I think they call it the London Eye now) back in 2004 and, despite the long line and hefty price, I was quite impressed with that ride. Amazing views of Big Ben and the rest of London overlooking the River Thames. \n\nSo...when I found out the largest pod wheel in the world had recently been erected in Vegas...well, I had to go! My husband and I and another couple went at around 1 something a.m. after partying on The Strip all night. Good decision. There was absolutely no line. Walked right into the pod that was probably 3x the size of the one in London, with only 2 other people on board. Off we went. The High Roller moves soooooo slow you can't even tell you're moving. Very smooth. Yes, great views but actually had better views from our room at the Cosmopolitan that overlooked The Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. If only they could have put the wheel in a different location. Still a cool experience; however, once is enough. \n\n\nAt $34.95 p\/p plus tax and $9 draft beers each, it's a one time must do experience in Vegas...and\/or fork out another 100 bucks per person and take a helicopter tour! Much better views and greater overall experience. [Review for Maverick Helicopters]
