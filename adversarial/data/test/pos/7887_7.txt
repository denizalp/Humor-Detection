Last time here we saw some good live music. This time was a Tuesday. We were in town on a Tuesday night and as we soon found out, that meant it was free open mic and stand-up comedy night. We actually had lots of laughs. Cruel laughs. And frankly, I don't know what gives me the right to be such a snark. God knows I'd cry my way off the stage, dead- armed too. \n\nDid I not mention that I think we saw some dude begin to weep after his set? Damn. How are you still smilin, Moose? The things you've seen? He was no worse than anyone else! Do you hear me? No worse than the rest of them! So, the night was part comedy, part tragedy, as so many often are. For real though, for a moment it was like being part of some kind of a heartbreaking documentary of sorts... while laughing with horror?  We never felt so alive.\n\nAnyway, upstairs is cool. The Smiling Moose has really good daily drink specials between 9 &11, the beer list is varied, and our bar tenders were lovely. We had a really good time. Good stuff. Also, since this place has, \"moose,\" in the name, it was a great opportunity to do movie quotes from 1981's Arthur. \"Why don't you forget about the moose for a moment!!!\" Ah man, now you made me miss Dudley Moore.
