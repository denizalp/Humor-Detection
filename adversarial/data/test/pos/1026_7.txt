Five stars for another convenient healthy option with a bonus drive-thru in the 'hood!\n\nI've been to the South Scottsdale D'lite (formerly D'lish) location a handful of times and always had a positive experience, but that one is a tad bit far for me to be a regular.  This new Indian School location is a little closer to home and some of the places I workout, so I have a feeling I'll be visiting often... especially for the signature \"Breakfast Buzz\" protein shake.  \n\nI love that you can customize the menu without anyone rolling their eyes (at least that I can tell)... I recommend getting the \"Breakfast Buzz\" with no chocolate syrup and on cold brew instead of milk... \n\nThe drive thru staff are super friendly and I'll report back on the wifi and inside once I return to experience both of those... from the other reviews and pictures, I'm pretty confident you can't go wrong with any of the above!
