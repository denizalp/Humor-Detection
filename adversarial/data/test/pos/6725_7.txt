This Michael's store (fantastic name for any business, btw) is actually located right next to the Ross on Arroyo Crossing Parkway, just west of Rainbow Blvd.\n\nIt's a pretty standard Michael's by most accounts. The store is pretty clean and well organized. What I really like about this location in particular is \n\na) it's pretty close to home\nb) they never give you a hard time about any refunds and\/or exchanges\nc) the employees here are always helpful and pleasant! \n\nI've always been a fan of the Michael's chain, but I am especially glad that I have a solid location as my neighborhood store!\n\n4 stars.
