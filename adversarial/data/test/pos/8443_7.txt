Service is always a hit or miss with KBBQ places, sometimes they feel like helping you, sometimes they don't.\n\nI can't help but keep going back because I actually like the quality of meat here.\n\nFavorite meats are : brisket, beef belly, pork belly and the ribeye!\n\nFavorite sides : kimchi, salad, and bean sprouts.\n\nNot a fan that you only get one steamed egg!\nSteamed egg is my favorite, you put it with your steamed rice and make a little fried rice with it.\nIf you want you can even add some kimchi with that to make kimchi fried rice.\nBut again, you only get a tiny one-- which is good to split with, at most, two people.\n\nVery well ventilated so unlike the other places you don't feel all the smoke all up in your face!\n\nThey change the grill as soon as it starts turning black or burned.\n\nUtensils (tongs, chopsticks and napkins) are already on the table and the serve-your-self water in bottles are set up along with your sides. \n\nIt's a tie between the dislikes and likes but I really like this place as far as AYCE KBBQ place goes!\n\nFYI - New management also made new rule that it has to be a party of 2 or more.
