Ku Noodle was the only eatery in the SLS that we saw that wasn't a small Los Angeles chain restaurant.  That alone determined my group's decision to dine here and split up a few dishes.\n\n\"Lucky 12\" - The dim sum sampler consists of a few of each dim sum items on the menu (shrimp & pork, scallop & pork, chicken, and lamb).  Each dumpling was less than bite size and was on par with the finest selection of frozen dim sum found at your local grocer.  Microwaved, that is.  2\/5\n\nFried Wontons - solid, with a decent curry sauce too.  3.5\/5\n\nBeef noodle soup was middle of the road.  The bowl was more broth than filling and lacked that beef flavor.  I've had much better back in LA, but after working through some macabre dim sum, this was a welcome distraction.  2.5\/5\n\nDan Dan noodles hit the spot.  Loaded with spicy minced pork, sliced cucumbers, radishes, and carrots, I'd have to say this was best item we split.  4\/5\n\nA decent spot to get some noodles if you don't the time or means of getting over to Chinatown.
