If you are looking for a truly authentic thai restaurant you must try Pamika. This small resto is a must try as their dishes really take you away to Thailand. The interior decor is simply remarkable and cozy. I would recommend for groups, a night with friends or a romantic dinner for two. Their dishes are truly authentic and packed wirh awesome flavors..every bite will keep you on the edge of your seat. Dishes are reasonably priced and they have set group menu's for groups of 8 or more which range from 35-50$. Would definitely come for more!!!
