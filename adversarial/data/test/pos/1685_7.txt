If you're going to have a burger from a fast food type of joint this one is by far my favorite. The meat is juicy and fresh and you can taste the quality. The chicken sandwich is my favorite I've ever tried and the milkshakes are bomb! We tried the peanut butter and it was super Ono! (Yummy). Service was pretty quick despite being busy and I like that they have wipes available to wipe my own table down and a high chair for my son who is still young so keeping germs away is pretty important to me. Shake shack is yummy! Bring one to Henderson please.
