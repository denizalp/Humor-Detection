We had our 2.5 year old sons haircut here. Our son was so excited to go here, he sat in the police car, and had Holly cut his hair. She was so darling and did such an amazing job. It wasn't easy, our son is such a wiggle worm... But his haircut looks so cute, we will continue to go back-especially to have Holly work her magic!
