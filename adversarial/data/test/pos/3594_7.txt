NO STARS NONE. This place is a joke!!!! Henry is an ***hole for lack of a better word. I wanted a hand painted design. Yes it was a little difficult but I'm ALWAYS willing to pay extra. AND I'm a hefty tipper. But after looking at my design on my phone Henry begins going around asking anybody if they'd be able to do it. RED FLAG. After coming back he says oh well do you want to go somewhere else. Huh WTF 0-o are you serious. No I'm here. I drove here. (I should've left) instead Im a glutton for bad customer service I stayed. I told Henry that I'd be willing to pick another design.... By that time he told me that some lady in the back would be able to do my nails but it would be this and that much extra a total of $70 dollars for my hands alone. Lol ok no ill go ahead and pick another design.... So some lady as other reviewers have stated begins to SILENTLY start my pedicure in Luke warm water. Smh. No this is were it gets weird I  pick a MUCH SIMPLER design and am told it would be the same price as the MUCH MORE DIFFICULT one. 0-o ok so no hand design for me..... I opt for a regular boring French tip. Henry marches over places a towel over my UNFINSHED toes and TELLS me to leave. Wooooow never in my 25 yrs of life or my 12 yrs of being a nail salon patron have I ever had that happen. I was mortified. Other customers were in shock as well. One audibly asked what the problem was. I still am shocked at henries behavior.  Just go somewhere else. It's not worth it. Henry if you happen to read this. You should know that is not how you conduct yourself.
