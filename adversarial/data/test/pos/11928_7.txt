Ever enter a dimly lit room, while searching for something? You squint your eyes...feel around with your hands....then you give up, walk back to the front of the room, jam your toe into something....and then...you turn on the light?\n\nAll of a sudden, you realize that the one item that you were looking for was sitting right in front of you the whole time! \n\nFriends of Yelp and the world....this best describes my search for Banh Mi in Las Vegas. I'd drive by Mr. Sandwich many times. My friend My T. is the Duke (with honors I might add).  I've had Banh Mi at Lee's and I thought it was good, then I even popped over to Hue Thai (seemingly related to Mr. Sandwich somehow)...but it still didn't quite knock it out of the park for me.\n\nThen on my lovely drive home, I finally stopped in. Yeah...it's pretty much the best Banh Mi that I've ever had. \n\nBread, so perfect, you'd feel like you were sitting at a boulangerie in France....Meat so tender, you'd feel like...I have no comparison...it's just perfect.\n\nThis is a small joint. It's WAY better than Lee's. They take credit cards, but they have more restrictive hours (not 24 hours). So you can't take a cab here after raging hard at your favorite Vegas clubs. Oh well.\n\nMake it a priority to eat here. Most sandwiches are less than $5 but taste like they should be priced at $50.\n\nAmazing!
