I stopped here to pick up some Candy for The Better Half (TBH).  She loves the Dove Dark Chocolate Candy and was having a bad day at work.....so to avoid bringing the bad Karma home, I surprised her with the Candy.\n\nNormally, I go to Walgreens, but it wasn't in the area and this CVS was on my way home.  It was a quick in\/out and the cashier scanned in her CVS Card so I could get the discount.  Does anyone ever use their card or does the cashier always use theirs?  I never bring my card.\n\nOverall, it was a typical CVS Pharmacy experience.  Clean store, friendly employees.\n\nWill I return?  You bet.
