If anyone claims to come here for the food or coffee they're outright liars. It's all about atmosphere with this place. I've been coming here for a few years and it's a few blocks from my house and I definitely enjoy the calm vibe this place sets.\n\nDespite what I said earlier, I'm really not knocking the food or coffee at this place. It's pretty good, but overpriced. In essence, you're paying more for the atmosphere of the place, so it makes sense. It's nice to find a place like this in Phoenix because I'd totally expect a coffeebar as such to be in Silverlake or Manhattan. Lux is a great place to read, share conversation, or just enjoy a hot cup of whatever. That being said, I'm not a die-hard fan of this place like some, but I enjoy stopping by every now and then.\n\nChances are if you're going to Lux you're one of two people: someone whose friend brought them along, or you want to look cool by going to a hip coffee shop. I've been reading alot of the negative reviews of this place and I don't see how those reviewers didn't know what they were getting in to. Just admit that you busted out your American Apparrel shirt and brought your copy of Wallpaper magazine to read while you sip your chai. It's alright, everyone does it there.
