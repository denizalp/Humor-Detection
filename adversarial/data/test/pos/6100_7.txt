I was suffering for about a week with trapezius strain and really needed a massage to get the kinks out. I was barely able to move my neck,  shrug my shoulders or even carry my purse. Yeah it was that bad. I swear I hold all my tension in my upper back\/shoulders. I also admit, I am guilty of bad posture which doesn't help. \n\nI chose John because of the positive reviews on Yelp, the fact that he is board certified, and it was one of the closest places to my home. I called and was able to get an appointment the next day for a one hour deep tissue massage. Just FYI -  Swedish massage is $45\/hr, deep tissue is $60\/hr which is very exceptional considering his skill set. \n\nGiven that I had specific problems, I booked in as a 1 hour deep tissue. I arrived at his location which is based out of his home. \n\nI let him know what my issues were and he was able to pinpoint the problem areas -  including spots that I didn't know that contributed to the problem like the sternocleiodmastoids, the scalenes and the insertion points at the base of the occiput. \n\nThis was definitely beyond my expectations. Literally within 2-3 days,  my pain gone and my range of motion was back to normal. \n\nI told my massage therapy buddy in Calgary and she was super impressed (she is also a board certified massage therapist with ART certification as well). The first thing she said after I told her about my experience was she wanted me to book a massage with him next time she is in town!
