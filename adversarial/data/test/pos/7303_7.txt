I love the concept of the Biodome and I really enjoyed my time there. We got tickets to both the Botanical Gardens and the Biodome (which can be purchased together at a discounted price). We were delighted that we could use the tickets on separate days without any special requests!\n\nThe Biodome is kind of like an indoor zoo. I'm sure if you've been to any zoo you've noticed that they have some indoor portions. For example, they probably have bird and ape houses. The Biodome is a lot like those places.\n\nOur favorite part was being able to see the environment from the ground floor and then go down a few steps and view the pond through a huge glass window. Above ground was completely different from the activity under water! We loved seeing the birds dive and swim to the depth of the pond to find food!\n\nThe habitats were very well kept up. The animals were out and frolicking. They were pretty standard ones - even common. There was a raccoon. There was a parrot. Then there was an otter, alligator, penguin and sloth. There weren't any monkeys. I love watching monkeys so this was a big let-down. There were no bears or big cats. There were no colorful tropical fish or eels.\n\nWe really wanted to see a wombat, naked mole rat and cuttlefish but we didn't see those. I would have liked to see more signs that described the animals and a bit about them. We went to a show about sloths. It was designed for kids but we enjoyed it. We like sloths.
