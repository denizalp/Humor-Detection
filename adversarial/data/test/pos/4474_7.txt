For all of my hipster hatred, I found myself at Handlebar last night and I had a wicked time! The atmosphere was dark and cavernous, adorned with old bicycles and the overall atmosphere was a super chill vibe. They had a dance floor and some wicked peeps spinning tunes. Being the Dancing Queen that I am, I was on that dance floor all night.\n\nBartenders were super friendly and made excellent cocktails. I'm not sure if all the people sitting down were eating???But I'm assuming they have food here, too?? When I'm dancing, I can't imagine why anyone would want to sit so I deduce that there must be some other equally exciting activity to keep them in their seats.\n\nHandlebar also has what is arguably the most space age bank machine I've ever encountered.\n\nI would definitely come back here for drinks any time.
