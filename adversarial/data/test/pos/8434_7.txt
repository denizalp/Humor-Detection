My goal on Saturday night was to stay home and just relax.  I should have listened to that goal.\n\nI have been to the Parlor many times in the past year and always enjoy my food and service. I have to say that my one experience there that I had Saturday night will guarantee that I never step foot in this place ever again.  This isn't something about it being an off night...management proved that they just do not care about their guests.\n\nAround 6 o'clock through Twitter the specials came through for the night.  They had listed a Prime Sirloin with a pesto spread and potatoes and broccolini.  Since my friend Jill and I end up sharing almost the same brain, she texted me immediately that we should go there and try it out.  I was game.  I even called over to the Parlor to ask about the special and if there was a wait.\n\n15 minutes later, at 7 o'clock, Jill and her boyfriend Tony show up and put their names on the waiting list.  About 10 minutes after I showed up we were seated. We sat down and immediately told the server that we wanted 3 specials.  Tony, the server (not be confused with BF Tony) regrettably told us that they were out of the special after I ordered an Iced Tea. Since Jill has Gluten and Dairy allergies, there wasn't anything else she could eat there.  We asked to speak with the manager before we would make up our minds to just leave.  Server Tony asked me if he should hold off on the tea and I told him yes.  (The iced tea is important to this event)\n\nThe manager (who I believe her name was Monica...not 100% sure) came up and acted very defensively about running out of the special...even before we had the opportunity to explain our situation.  Jill said that I even called before to make sure about the special and there wasn't anything else she could eat.  Manager excused herself, came back, and stated that they could use a flank steak instead.  We asked what the price would be for that and she said the same price.  For a FLANK STEAK?  That isn't even close to the quality of a Prime Sirloin!  Manager Monica (?) said that she would comp us either drinks or dessert.  We decided to stay...silly people we were.\n\nServer Tony came back, with my iced tea...though I never told him that I wanted it again.  He asked if everything was taken care of.  We said yes and that the manager said that she would comp drinks...so we all ordered glasses of wine.  Tony leaves and then comes back to tell us that Manager Monica told him that she would comp us desserts and $2 off our entree.  Since Jill can't eat the dessert and that wasn't what was discussed, we asked for the manager again.\n\nEnter Eric.  I have to say that I never met a bigger jackass in my life.  He comes up to us and says \"My name is Eric and the Parlor is considered my place.  As we make specials, you have to understand that it isn't an exact science.  Sometimes we run out of things.\"  Fine we get that.  I told him that the not having a special is now a moot point since his manager offered us something that she is now reneging on. He faces me and says \"Have you ever worked in a high stressed environment before?  Sometimes we say things that we just think about then.\"  I told him that \"Yes I have worked in a high volume stressed workplace before and as a manager I honor what comes out of my mouth.\"  I am sorry, but if you can't trust your manager with making decisions in a \"high stressed\" environment then you need to rethink your staff.  He then back pedaled and said that he would comp the whole bill for us if that is what we wanted.  We told him we weren't looking for a free meal, but ok.  Food came and he left.\n\n\nWell, of course, the flank steak (cooked medium rare) what not up to par and very tough. The broccolini had absolutely no flavor.  The potatoes were great though.  \n\nOf course this isn't the end of the story.  The bill came and I am not shitting you....the only thing on the bill was my iced tea.  After all of that, you couldn't comp my iced tea along with everything else? We should have left then, because a few minutes later the server came back and told us that he handed us the wrong bill.  The correct bill was drinks comped, 3 entrees for $12 and still my iced tea.  (Yes this is a big deal to me)  We couldn't believe it.  \n\nIf a restaurant is not prepared for a special for Saturday night (a high volume day) then you shouldn't even offer a special.  As a friend said to me today, this is a pizza joint and they should just stick to pizza and not offer these other specials just to get us in. \n\nCustomer service comes a long way especially in our economy.  I will be willing to pay for good food and good service.  The Parlor proved that they have neither.
