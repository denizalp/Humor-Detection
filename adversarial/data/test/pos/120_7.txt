It pains me to do this, but it must be said.\n\nThis place has gone down the drain. \n\nWhen it first opened I came here often and loved the videos of the plants growing on the screens, the food and the friendly service. I used to take many of my clients out here just so they could soak in the vibe. \n\nI've been here a few times within the past few months and each time my experience gets worse. Today really took the cake.\n\nI came in to order for take out. The place wasn't busy and I even got a parking spot out front! I put 20 minutes on the meter not imaging how my regular order of the Roosevelt which is basically avocado on toast could take any longer. \n\nI placed my order and waited, and waited and waited and waited. \n\n37 minutes after the transaction time on my receipt my to go order comes out. The girl who handed it to me was incredibly rude and the box of food was wide open! \n\nTo really sprinkle the sugar on top I walked outside to discover that not only did I get terrible service and wait forever, I had also received a parking ticket! \n\nI will not be returning here. There are too many other new places in downtown that make quality food, offer good service and can put a takeout order out in less than 40 minutes.
