The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced.  I bought a way overpriced car & 3 things went wrong in the first day, including the brakes, which is a safety hazard!!! One of the car salesmen (rofl) was nice & one of the ladies there was nice (but new so had NO clue what she was doing), the rest were extremely rude including the managers!!! DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
