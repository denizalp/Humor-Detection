Unfortunately I am done....I love Dr Venkat she is an awesome doctor.  Her office staff is the worst I've ever seen.  I had an appointment with Dr Venkat several months ago and asked for prescription refills, NEVER DONE.  I asked for a referral to continue to see my Asthma\/Allergy doctor, NEVER done.  After calling for several months I finally had to go into the office and stand there until they did the referral and could prove to me it was done.\n\nI still have NEVER received my blood pressure Meds so I finally called two days ago and made an appointment.  The first available was three weeks out so we booked it.  Later that evening I got a message from her office saying she will be out of the office on the day\/time of my appointment and needed to change it to an earlier time that day or another day which they have several to choose from even earlier then my scheduled appointment.\n\nI called back yesterday, was placed on hold for 25 minutes, now way past 5pm, Audrey finally came back to the phone, I explained to her what was going on, she told me to hold and hung up on me.  I immediately called back, got the answering service who said they do not have a back line into the office and all I could do is leave a message for them which they will get in the morning.\n\nI called my insurance and changed my Primary Care Manager which went through immediately, I then called my new doctor and got an appointment scheduled for Monday morning...wow so sorry Dr Venkat, this is the second time I left because of your office staff not caring and following through, there will not be a third time....
