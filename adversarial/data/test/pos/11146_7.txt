Walking the mall, came across Kona Grill. Wanted\/needed to munch and have some wine, not necessarily a heavy meal. As a sit down proper restaurant in the mall (as opposed to the food courtyard) it was ok.\n\nOur server Miss Aden was the highlight of our stay. She is an upbeat wonderful server with the ability to be helpful without hovering. Her wonderful attitude and service was great! \n\nUsing the Yelp app we received a free appetizer,,, so Thanks Yelp! We ordered the Spicy Lettuce Wraps which turned out to be fantastic! The taste was wonderful and the cucumber side salad fit perfectly when a cool-down was needed cause the spicy was hot... Nice! Additionally ordered Spicy Shrimp Tempura and this was also very good~had a great kick. Guess we should have stopped there but had ordered a bottle of Petite Syrah that we had not yet finished killing; so on we go! California Roll and Yellowtail Sushi,,, hmmm? Looked a bit sad (please see pic) and so was I :(\n\nWould return as the menu has lots to offer but most likely will skip the aforementioned sushi. Miss Aden was so accommodating, we'll be coming back to this Kona Grill.
