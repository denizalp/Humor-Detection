I haven't stayed at the Wynn in years. The rooms are still very nice and the hotel is very pretty. But it's lost its shiny glow and the service has gone down hill. They are not accommodating here.  They also now charge for seats by the pool which is ridiculous. 100 a couple for the resort pool and 200 for the adult pool. Shouldn't shade be included for the 40.00 resort fee? They charge for absolutely everything and I find it really annoying. Especially when it's accompanied by zero service. Bring your own sunblock. They charge 36.00 for a small spray can. It's just ridiculous. \n\nRooms are very comfortable and perfectly temperature controlled with no loud air conditioners. Nice lighting, big tubs. Very clean. You won't be able to put anything in the fridge because it's full of things you get charged for if you move them. Curtains give full black out. \n\nThe casino is less happening, it's more foreigner based now and an older crowd, families too. Which is fine, just know what to expect.
