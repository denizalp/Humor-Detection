I have been to Roman Bistro a few times and I'm on their email list. Here are the things I have to say. \n\nPros\n1. It's called Roman Bistro 33...why 33 because the have 33 beers on tap. Yeah that's 33 more beers than any other Bar in Forest Hills because there are literally no other bars in Forest Hills. Having said that 33 is a pretty good number for any bar. \n\n2. Live music at least once a week. I like live music no matter what it is. Beats Muzak playing in the background. \n\n3.Deals every day of the week, get on their mailing list and you can stay up to date. \n\n4. Flat Breads yummmy........\n\nCons\n\n1. The Cigar\/Bottle Shop next door is weak. If I wanted to pay $5 for a cheap beer I would go to a bar in downtown. The cafe bottle shops at Giant Eagle beat the crap out of their bottle shop.\n\nConclusion\nIt's a great place especially for being in Forest Hills. Give a try and I don't think you will be disappointed.
