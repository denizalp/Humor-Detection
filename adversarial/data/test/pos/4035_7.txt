Not sure what the bad reviews are about. I did only just move in this weekend, but so far I'm elated! The apartment is really amazing. The view is phenomenal. Yes, it's an older building, but I'd rather think of it as classic Vegas! The amenities are great, and so far everybody I've met, neighbors and staff, are very friendly. The staff has gone out of their way to make my move into the building as smooth as possible. Maintenance seems to be within an earshot if I need them for anything. The neighborhood is obviously not the greatest or safest in Vegas, but you don't have to move in here to realize that. As long as you're in the building you're pretty safe. They went to great lengths to secure the property from unwanted guests.\nBottom line is that I knew what to expect moving in here. It's not Summerlin. This is my first time living this close to the inner city, and it's perfect for my current situation. Number one factor was that they accepted my pit bull (upon meeting her). Secondly, I'm not having to deal with the witch hunts of intrusive HOAs and nosey neighbors with sticks up their asses. I feel very comfortable here, and foresee no major issues that would convince me that I haven't made the right choice moving in. And it has to be said again, I'm looking out my windows right now and I'm just in awe of this view!!
