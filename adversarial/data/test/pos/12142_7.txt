Giving LAS a 3-star score...it still smells too smokey...but...either you are landing in Vegas, which leads to WOOOOOOO YEAH VEGAS!!! Or you're headed home tired and hung over and broke and it's like errrrrr...ouch...uhhhh Vegas....blah.\n\nSo a nice average score and this airport is really hit or miss...sometimes security is awful, sometimes super breezy easy. Sometimes the cab lines are awful, sometimes a ghost town...Vegas is what you make it I guess.\n\nENJOY, and GOOD LUCK!
