I couldn't wait to put this review. I'll make it short and not so sweet \n\nCashier-pretentious SOB. At $227 for party of 4, they should provide etiquette training. \n\nWaiters\/bus boys- I asked for straws 3x. Never got any\n\nFood-cheap ass clam chowder or chicken noodle. Wtheck is that crap about. Souplantation offers more variety. \n\nCrab- ummmm never refilled and Bottom of the barrel. \n\nDesserts- that's the one star. All others zero\n\nDrinks- get your own damn drinks. Yep $50+ get your own. \n\nNever again !
