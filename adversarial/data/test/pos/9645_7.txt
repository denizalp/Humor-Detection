I had been to the Flip Side in Columbus a year ago and really enjoyed it. I finally got to try this one in my neighborhood today. \n\nWe ordered onion rings to start and my husband liked them but I thought they were just OK, not much flavor although looked appetizing. \n\nI ordered a turkey burger which was very good, a perfect balance of toppings, but again, it needed a little kick to the sauce. \nNo effort was made to make a nice sauce, described as red pepper vinaigrette, but seemed similar to sirracha. \n\nMy husband got the Red Door burger and he seemed very satisfied with it. \n\nWe went at 1:30 on a weekday afternoon so was not busy, but still, service seemed slow. \n\nI would probably go back and I did like the look of the restaurant, but for a gourmet burger place I prefer B Spot.
