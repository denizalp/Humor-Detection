Honestly, if you tried to tell me that I would be writing a positive review for Chuck E Cheese 3 years ago, I would have told you- you were nuts! Because 3 years ago, I didn't even know what this place was.  Then after having my son, I avoided Chuck E. Cheese like the plague because the place just seemed noisy and ANNOYING to me.\nWell, here I am 3 years later giving Chuck E. Cheese 5 stars- why?  Because my 3 year old absolutely LOVES this place.  \nDon't ask me how because I've never mentioned Chuck E. Cheese to him but at 2 1\/2 when we drove past a Chuck E. Cheese, he could call out the place by name and wanted to go there.\nFINALLY, I could not avoid the place any longer after we were invited there for a birthday party and my son was so excited to go there.  Once there, my son was in heaven!!\nThe noise level on a busy Saturday morning still drives me crazy but I've since gone with my son and friends on a weekday morning when it's not so busy and I have to admit, it is a very safe environment with fun games that will entertain your child for hours.\nAnd definitely get on their email list for their great coupons and specials because if you are like me (and I never thought I would be doing it), you will end up buying tokens by the bucket load!\nSo Chuck E. Cheese, never thought I would ever be doing this but here's a 5 star posting for you!
