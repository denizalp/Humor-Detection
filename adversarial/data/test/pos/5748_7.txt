I had an exceptionally shitty time here.  One hot Sunday afternoon this summer after a movie, four of us popped in for a round of pre-dinner cocktails.  The atmosphere looked promising- trendy and hip without too much pretention- but this pretty décor was the only passable quality about this place.  \nThe hostess and server were both super sweet, but fantastically dumb.  We ordered a cheese plate which arrived in about 20 minutes, and though it was unbelievably disappointing in taste and volume what was more ridiculous was that we still hadn't received our drinks.  We could clearly see the one ambivalent bartender working-and I use that term very loosely- dilly dallying around.  His bar patrons were exclusively drinking beer, so it's not like he was busy slinging frozen high-maintenance drinks.  After about 30 minutes our server gave us another nervous giggle and blamed it on the printer being out of paper- but we could still see him doing abso-fucking-lutely NOTHING which was just maddening.  After 45 min I had a little freak-out and finally a manager went back there to light a fire up this guy's dawdling ass and subsequently offer us a kind apology.  I give it two stars for décor and management's efforts--but they really should be running a much tighter ship.
