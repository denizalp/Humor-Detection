I was a member for Life Time in Green Valley for about seven months until we moved from Nevada to Connecticut. It's taken me a while to write this review as I have some serious mixed feelings about this place. I was a member of ClubSport in Green Valley...a beautiful place where everyone knew each other and everything was comfortable. They were horrible at making money with old equipment and minimal advertising and so when Life Time came into town, they were run out of business. I was forced to find another gym. I decided to visit Life Time and ended up signing up for a family membership. \n\nCost - Very very expensive. In addition to signup fees etc, the monthly fee paid for ONE member (when we signed up) was $150. Additional family member was $90. Third family member was $60. If we had a fourth it would be $40 for that one and then free after that. So if you have like eight kids, this is a great deal. Also, they charge extra for everything. You have a guest....slap you with a charge even though your membership comes with guest visits. They institute these ridiculous timing restrictions and just annoy the crap out of you. A members event like Halloween or Daddy Daughter Dance? Slap on a hefty charge...after a while it just pisses you off. I canceled my membership when I moved and happened to come back to Las Vegas to tie up some loose ends. I didn't go to the gym the last month I paid for my membership since I was in process of moving. I have many friends that are members. When I called to ask if I could come in on one of their guest memberships...I was told a flat out no as I had \"visited\" the gym in the prior 6 months. I told them my story and that I was a member who paid for 3 people and had literally not been to the gym for the last month and paid for that month. Nope...they would not budge and said I would need to pay the guest charge which is like $50 a day or something. On point of principle...hell no. I understand making money...but seriously...\n\nAmenities - Machines are all very updated, serviced on time and clean. Lots of cardio as well as weight machines. Classes are plentiful but I never really attended classes. I attended one spin class in my tenure there and it was nothing to write home about. The locker room is nice, the showers are not the cleanest but again, I used them sporadically. I primarily did cardio and light weights early in the morning. The pool (indoor) is amazing. It is heated and has a separate kiddie area so you can choose not to deal with the kids. The outdoor pool is nice but it was like a pool at a hotel. Seems very weird for a health club. I avoided it like the plague. The 24\/7 access is also very useful. \n\nStaff - Generally, the staff were alright but seriously fake as can be expected in a place like this. There were a few personal trainers who were friendly. Front desk was for the most part pretty awful. Now...see the childcare section below for my separate take on that. The sales guy who signed me up as well as the sales guy that I went to cancel my membership were extremely annoying. More so than other gym sales dudes. \n\nChildcare facility - Now, if there is something I actually loved about this place and didn't feel horrible spending that much money for, it is the childcare facility. They had top-notch people working there who were friendly, great with kids and responsible. The facility was super clean. The employees were so responsive and security is impeccable. Now, if I were someone with many kids and no paying job, this is a great deal. (Never-mind, that I would probably go insane being that person.) Drop my kids off at great care, and chill for an hour or two. But since we used this facility maybe twice a week (weekends primarily) and with only one child, I feel that in my case, it did not justify the cost. \n\nI have to say that since I left Life Time, I've felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders - most likely the financial ridiculousness of the membership. Just logically, I feel like I should not be paying that much for cardio and light weights.  Also, not having to see the silicone-filled middle-aged lady in highly unflattering workout wear that talks loudly on her phone while on the elliptical next to me is refreshing (most of the clientele btw). I've joined a nice gym that is more reasonable, has the machines I use, is clean, has a decent clientele, is not insane about charging me for every step I take and close to the house. If a Life Time moved to my area in CT right now, I don't think I would join. Not to say I didn't enjoy it....I just wouldn't do it again.\n\nPS. do not pay for the \"experience life\" magazine they make you get with your membership and then have to call and cancel. it is probably one of the worse reading materials I have come across. They still send me emails to sign back up for that BS. I mean, it was really really bad.
