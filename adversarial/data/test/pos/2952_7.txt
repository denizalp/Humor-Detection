When I was here last week, one of the other folks at the table asked me if there were lots of places like this in Ann Arbor, where I live.  Sadly, I had to answer no.  There's nothing quite like this in Ann Arbor, which is too bad. There are some great places here, and even a couple of nice places to sip wine, but the feel of Postino is totally different.\n\nThe warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open (nice garage doors), and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter, I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere.  I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?\n\nThe bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.\n\nAnd of course, I enjoyed the wine.  In warm weather, I'm a white wine kind of gal, so I sipped a nice glass of Pinot Grigio. I was totally charmed by both the food and the company. Oh, and extra charm points for playing some Otis Redding. The service was just fine -- attentive without being intrusive. If they can't open a Michigan location, then I guess I'll just have to come back the next time I'm around Phoenix.
