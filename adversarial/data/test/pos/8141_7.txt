I only went there at first following a pretty man, I'm a Starbuck's whore. I like my fancy overpriced drinks.  I accidentally ordered a tall muscular man on a stick...later correcting myself to get a tall soy latte. After he left...I realized that my latte was good..almost...dare I say...as good as Starbucks.  I'm only bias at times because I make coffee or a living.  But when I taste good coffee I admit it.  And they are the only place that sells good vegan cookies...my weakness.  \nIts on the bottom floor of Nordstrom...and no better place I'd say. \n Im having another affair with this place..and I'm liking it. Starbucks...my husband, Dunkin's my pool boy, and Nordstrom...my dirty filthy cougar bait!
