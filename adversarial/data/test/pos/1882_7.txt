Very solid steakhouse.  I loved the Sinatra-esque feel to the ambiance.  With enough imagination and style, you could really fool yourself to feel part of the rat pack. \n\nThe crab cake is the best item on the menu for me.  A generous portion of lump crab with very minimal breading is pan fried and served piping hot.  The steak tartare is just a must!  \n\nI appreciate the method of preparing their steaks.  It's seasoned lightly with salt and nothing else.  You have the option of ordering a sauce but I really see no point with quality meat.  Just be sure they understand what medium rare means.  My steak was medium to medium well.  I could have sent my steak back but the service was superb. \n\nExcellent list of wines.  A variety of notable Napa wines that most restaurants do not carry such as Shafer and Peju.  Also, nice selection of Mendoza Malbec wines.
