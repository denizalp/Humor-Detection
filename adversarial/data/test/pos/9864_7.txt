My stay was so bad that I will simply copy and paste part of an email I sent to management.  To sum it up, I had no service at the front counter, a dirty room, no towels, dirty bathroom, locked out of the room waiting in the hallway for it seems like an eternity and told that they could do nothing but have me wait, then sent to a second room that was dirty again with a non working remote control! WTF! I shot 2 videos of my experience which are up on youtube and the management on shift did not seem to care.  I have video of me telling them that I have video of the crappy service and they didn't even want to view it at all! Ridiculous, definitely.  Our past 2 stays at Bellagio, a sister property of theirs (MGM) and Wynn(Encore) have been excellent.   \n\nMy recent stay at Aria was alarmingly bad. In the past 8 years I've been frequenting Las Vegas, I have not complained once about hotels I've stayed at. I started my experience on the 20th of December with nobody greeting us at the front desk check in with lanes open. We eventually walked up to the attendant (with her head down not looking at customers) and got our room. The room was dirty with dirty shower and hair all over and no towels. Also, we had to call for the in room dining menu since no folios were filled, just empty shells. On our 2nd night we were locked out of our room and then told that the entire key creation system was down so we waited for someone to let us in. Problem: nobody was sent up to help let us in. We iPhone searched for the front desk again and got someone up there eventually, who ended up unable to help. Cue second master key holder and I started shooting videos via iPhone to show this service. She also said there is nothing to do but wait. My gf had stomach problems and needed to get in to our room we paid for but we could only wait as she was unable to do anything. Cue locksmith and finally we get in. Since the entire key lock system was dead in 21224, we were moved to 33121. Good luck with that, because not only was that room dirty when we walked in but the remote control didnt work. I called in to have it fixed while we gambled and the remote in the second room was stood upright but still did not work. Our past 2 stays were at Bellagio, a sister property and Wynn, both of which were great experiences. Never in my Vegas experiences have I encountered such ridiculous service. I've included the YouTube links below of my key lockout experience for you to view. The assistant manager on shift did not seem to care about my videos but I think the public will. I hope this will shed some light on my displeasure and you will understand that I could not imagine how service can run like that in a high level casino. I hope you can give me an explanation on how this is worthwhile of the money I spent to visit your establishment and how the service was in the videos I've made.
