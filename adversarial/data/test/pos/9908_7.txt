There isn't a lot to do when you are vacationing and pregnant.  My usual approach of \"Let's hit the speakeasy\" and \"We'll do a brewery tour\" does not work.  But my bae and I met my bff Jeff in Charlotte for Memorial Day weekend and El Jefe suggested an escape room.\n\n\"Ah, it looks like they have one of the rooms where they blindfold and handcuff you.\"  He said this appreciatively, like he was an afficianado (which it turns out he is).\n\"What?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"I'll try it, but not that one.  I will go to jail for sure.\"  I meant because of violence.\n\nBy chance of fate, this room called \"The Kidnapping\" was the only one available at a reasonable time (pre 9pm, pregnant equivalent of 4am).  I had major reservations and almost zero no expectations of enjoying this experience.\n\nBut I totally did.  So much that we booked a second escape room at the same place before brunch the next day!\n\nRooms were challenging and I must say, surprisingly professional and well-designed.  Our second room was \"Museum Heist\" which I would say we found a little more challenging than \"The Kidnapping.\"  Our Gamemaster Ian was a blast, and you should be sure to request him if you play DnD or are otherwise a nerd.  He made tons of jokes and even laughed at mine.  Which gets anyone an A+.\n\nI'm hilarious.
