Nestled into the plethora of competition on Danforth, this small little bistro didn't do much to impress me. \n\nFirst of all this place is for local traffic only as there is no free parking available, like many others on this particular strip. If I'm going to have to pay for parking I'd like to expect a decent experience However this venue seemed to really miss the mark for me. Marketed as a \"rock n roll\" bistro with the only real reflection of this being the pictures adorning the walls and the obvious name otherwise it was a rather stuffy little Italian bistro in my eyes and I did some researching prior as well.\n\nThe service is fast and fairly pleasant however there is a real rushed feeling here, maybe it's the limited seating I'm not sure but this isn't really a place id like to sit and enjoy company. I found it cramped, very dark... so dark that reading the menu was an actual issue for many guests in fact a few used their own phones to illuminate the menu. The setup of the seating was even more awkward with the only real highlight seeming to be the small back patio that looked quaint however it is awkwardly tucked in the back of this very small venue. The front patio is literally a sliver, I think it's supposed to be for \"people watching\" it's just very cramped with these cold metal tables and seating. \n\nThey have what seems like a wonderful bartender though it's hard to tell who is who as there are so many people behind the bar. They have a selection of kraft cocktails however none are sweet and again can vary in time and taste depending on who makes it. \n\nThe specials are pushed a fair bit but they are a tad expensive for what they offer, however they do have a fair bit of varying selection on they're menu. They do not do many if any substitutions which i understand is for convenience and prob time however there isn't a lot of personalization here. They offer fresh pepper and Parmesan only for certain dishes and actually suggest against using it in particular ones. I don't think that would have bothered me had I expected it but I didn't know it was such a fussy culinary destination when I chose to visit.\n\nLastly The owner appears to hang out at the location often, sitting at the bar and eating which I've never been a fan of. It's fine when other guests are getting served but when your servers attention is split between guests and the owner, that's just a little odd to me and something I rarely see.\n\nUltimately there are way too many amazing eateries in the area for me to bother going back here
