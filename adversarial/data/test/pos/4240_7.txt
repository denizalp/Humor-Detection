I'm digging the fast food\/sit down hybrid concept although it honestly felt more fast food to me. Prices were appropriate for portions and quality. The real question is - how good were the burgers?!\n\nFarmer Burger ($5.69)  - still Low carbing so I requested a lettuce wrap (not on the menu, but they had no problems accomodating). The meat itself is in thin patties - very fast food and I think the ones at say In n out are yummier and a bit cheaper. What this place has that you can't get at In n Out is bacon and avocado on the burger! Although the avocados were mashed, they did taste like genuine avocados - NOT some guac processed mushy crap. The bacon was nice and crisp and better than your typical fast food bacon. Honestly my lettuce wrapped burger was a bit of a mess (In n Out has that protein style thing DOWN PAT), but it was overall tasty and being able to get avocado on my burger at  fast food place is pretty sweet ! \n\nTheir salads also looked awesome - way better looking than anything you could get at MCD's\/Wendy's. Definitely will be back to try that Cobb salad with 10 net carbs that was calling my name! \n\nOverall a nice change from the usual fast food burgers. Avocado lovers rejoice !
