How is this place so popular?!\n\nIs it the over priced sandwiches? The smell of urine from the bum that hangs out outside? The undercooked chocolate chip cookies?\n\nThis place has line ups out the door at lunch time. I keep going back because Bloor West Village lacks options, but it just isn't good.
