Woof ! Woof! I give this 5 rounds of a paws!!\n\nSo my little bichon maltese mix is a little puppy and i work so damn much.. Everytime i come home my place would be a mess and chewed up items like my $500 gucci eyeglasses, and my $200 Oakley sandals would be chewed up and i would have all my books all over my room chewed up as if she was doing this on purpose. Enough was enough when i came home one day and my cork board along with my marker board was on the ground and there was writings all over my floor ,  she tried to write on my carpets with the marker.. smart dog eah...\n\nI always drove by this place in seven hills drive , and i thought to myself hmmm i wonder if i should take my hyper girl over there. \nMy assistant was going through the same thing with her dog and she told me to take her to the doggy day care.\nSo I toured the place and was pretty impressed on the services they offered. They had an array of services to pamper your dog, boarding, or just your typical doggy day care..\n\nI chose the day camp for my dog, This gave her the opportunity to mingle with other dogs and release all her energy while I was at work..\n\nAfter work i  picked her up and she is exhausted. By the time we reach home all she wanted to do is lay down and rest. THIS WAS AWESOME! she didnt need that much attention from me and all her energy was drained from the day camp.\n\nIf you are working all the time and you love yoru dog like a child this is the place to take them.\nThe staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable as well. For a doggy day camp it was only $25,.\n\nTry now and let your bestfriend mingle and socialize with other dogs they will love you! and it beats them just sitting around the house all alone..
