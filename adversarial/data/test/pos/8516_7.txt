We always come to this coffee shop; their Elvis has become our go to morning drink. However, they can't seem to know how to create a toasted bagel with cream cheese... the first time we went, we received our bagels non toasted even though we explicitly asked them to toast them. Okay fine, maybe they forgot. We go again today and make sure they knew to toast our bagels; and again, the bagels come non toasted.. and to make matters worse, the amount of cream cheese was minimal, laughable, very inconsistent. And I don't think they forgot, I legitimately think that they thought they actually toasted our bagels before handing us cold pieces of dough. Will probably get our own toaster so we don't have to come back here.
