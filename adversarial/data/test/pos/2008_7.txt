The Subway of SUSHI! That pretty much says it all.  And its just as fast!\n\nPICK YOUR\n+ Wrap: Seaweed or Soy\n+ Rice: White or Brown \n+ Veggies: Avocado, Cucumber, Asparagus, Tamago (Egg), Sprouts, the list goes on\n+ Meats: Beef, Chicken (I know crazy huh) Salmon, Smoked Salmon, Tuna, Ebi (Shrimp), Unagi, the list goes on\n\nIf you are lazy to customize your roll, you can hand pick from a fixed menu, not as many though.  Another option is to turn it into a bowl instead of a roll! Hey that rhymed! Just as delicious! An average meal will run you about $9.\n\nThey do have a condiments area where you can self pour a small cup of soy sauce and unlimited ginger and wasabi.  Go nuts I say! :P
