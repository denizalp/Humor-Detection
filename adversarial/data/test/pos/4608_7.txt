I LOVE bingo. Do NOT come here if you love bingo. I have been to MANY bingo places before and this is by far the worst. You CANNOT talk. If you do, you will get scolded. You cannot even whisper!! I came for my birthday, to have a good time... no good time to be had unless you know sign language. Huge disappointment. It is also expensive (for bingo). I paid $40\/per person to play 2x 6 ons, paper. You can get more for less a lone butte.
