Bonasera is a neighourhood pub and restaurant that is nothing more than what it is. I've been there a few times and as far as the cheap wings on Tuesdays go, the place is just fine. The wings are good and come in a variety of flavours. The Greek ones are particularly good.\nOne night we were still hungry after a few cans of Guinness and wings and ordered a pizza. That's when Bonasera fell apart. There was no sauce on the goddamn thing. After we objected, the rough-and-tumble waitress brought us a cup of cold marinara sauce. It was a nightmare. How can you have the word pizza in your name and not even know how to make it properly?\nIf you find yourself there for reasons beyond your control, stick with the wings....
