I'm in love with this airport. It's small, which makes it so easy to get in and out. Everything that's good about this airport stems from it being so small. Less people, quicker check-in, shorter lines at the security checkpoint, not having to walk a mile between everything. Major airports couldn't give a lesser shit about you making your flight. How stressful it is when a hodgepodge of strict (and mostly senseless) procedures make everything so impersonal and take forever. At Mesa, however, we received a message on the perfectly clear intercom when it was time to head to the check-in counter, then to head to our gate. The attendants at the check-in counter also assured us all that we would not miss our flight.\n\nAllegiant is the only airline that flies into this airport I believe, and I know what I'm getting when flying them. They are able to keep things cheap by itemizing everything. They still come out as the most affordable option even when adding a checked bag and priority boarding, and even more when adding a rental car or hotel to your package. Allegiant rules for what they are.
