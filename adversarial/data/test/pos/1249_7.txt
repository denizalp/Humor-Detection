Superstore is right! This store has everything you can imagine for a baby (except the stroller I'm buying). They have a great selection of baby gear and I have plans to do some major damage here in the next couple of weeks. They have a nice registry process and they give you a goodie bag filled with helpful information. The prices are reasonable and I've noticed some helpful sales. However, I walk in and I'm blinded by cute baby clothes and I'm afraid this is only the beginning! Come here if you need: baby clothes, baby gear, accessories, tools, furniture, strollers, cribs, car seats, etc. They also have a card and gift wrapping area so it's a one stop shop for gifting.
