Filipino style, period. It's the Filipino version of the standard American diner. Small cafeteria type buffet with good basic authentic dishes. Pork and Chicken Adobo, Menudo, Pancit etc.\n\nDivey  little place that welcomes you home each time you visit. Never been there for their evening services but with the full bar and Kareoke machine I'm sure it gets hopping.  \n\nThey have great Halo Halo and the prices are reasonable.  I'll stop in every time I visit Phoenix.  \n\nYou can watch the Filipino dramas from the many TV's on the wall. I'm sure they convert to Kareoke monitors later on.
