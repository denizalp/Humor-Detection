Wow. After Momofuku these people take the cake for serving hyped up sub-par barely edibles. Momofuku and its oily so-called ramen is an injury, Sweet Jesus is the insult.\nLet me get this right: it is a very normal ice cream with some old tasting chocolate chips on it, but we are suckered into it. Why? because it is $3 more expensive for the comparable ice cream anywhere else in the city. And also because the line-up proves it is good, right? Wrong.\nAs for the Krusty cone or whatever it is called I had a lick and again meh nothing special.\n\nFor the same ice cream without the looks walk into a convenience store. For better ice cream for less price walk over to Kekou about ten minutes from here.\n\nBy the way, it is ridiculous that they want a tip. For what?? You can already afford to pay your employees $40 an hour!\n\nNew rule: if I am standing in line for anything ANYTHING it has to be because THEY will pay ME
