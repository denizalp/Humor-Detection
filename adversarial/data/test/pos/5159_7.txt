I dropped family off for an early flight from McCarran and used that as an excuse to stop somewhere and have breakfast.  I ended up here because it was bookmarked and because the other place I was going to try didn't open until 7 either and I wasn't going to wait there that long.  See it was an early flight.\n\nWhen the doors were unlocked, I went in and had my choice of where to sit.  It's not a large place.  The server brought my menu and after some thought, I got the Huevos Divorciados, divorced eggs.  It comes with potatoes, refried beans, and tortillas.  The divorced of the eggs is one red and one green.  The green is topped by some good chile verde and the red is gotten from a red sauce that has a bit of a kick.\n\nOn the wall on the west side of the room is an area where they have the plastic ware you dispense for yourself and there are napkins there, too.\n\nThe breakfast was good but the plate was detracted by how poorly it looked on arrival.  The potato slices run on to the eggs which run onto the beans.  It tasted better than it looked.  Perhaps less runny beans or a plate with compartments?\n\nService was OK after a little bit of a shaky start.  I had to wait for the coffee but that was OK.  They just opened and they were brewing a fresh pot.\n\nA good place to stop but I think it would be a better lunch stop than breakfast!
