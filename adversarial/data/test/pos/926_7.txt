Ok here is the thing, I went back another time and it was good. \n\nAbout a month later we came late with our roomie. It was bar service only since it was late. \n\nThe bartender a middle aged over weight red haired guy went to get our chips..\n\n\nI watched him walk over to the chips and grab handfuls of chips with his bare hands. HE IS THE BARTENDER HANDLEING MONEY AND HE WAS JUST HOLDING A DIRTY RAG.\n\nI asked him for a new batch that was \"hand picked\" he said it was all bare hand touched. \n\nI told him that was fine for the food preparers that dont handle fecal, infectious disease money!!\n\nHe acted like I was retard, I didnt eat anything after I saw this but we did have a few bites and the food was not good.\n\nIt wasnt aweful but it wasnt good as before, AT ALL!\n\nGet it together over there\n\n\nmore like 2 and a half\n\nP.S. If the owners read this, he needs to be schooled. I wish I knew his name, he may have had a mustache?
