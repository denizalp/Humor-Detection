Getting a man's haircut shouldn't be difficult. \n\nIf, like me, you leave it until you look like a dirty hippy from the 60s and then go in to get as close (and simple) a trim as possible, then don't go to this place! If you want something more than that, then definitely don't go to this place.\n\nI feel like I fought a drunken lawnmower.
