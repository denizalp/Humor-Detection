Don't you just love it when you can text a friend: \"Need your help with something, meet for dinner in an hour.\" \n\nNo questions asked, they reply when and where. Boom, that's a friend right there. \n\nMet two friends, we like to call ourselves \"group B\" because we are born winners, at this little unassuming Greek spot. First off, I was like, I need to eat salad. Second, ain't nothing gonna top a Greek salad (because you can get gyro meat on it ... shit, is that defeating the purpose of ordering a salad). Anyway, we showed up about 30 minutes before this place closed and they were so nice to us. No one gave us the look. We ate our salads like true basic bitches, although one of us was a guy, but men can be basic too. Then we discussed our highly top secret matter until it was time to get the hell out. \n\nIn conclusion, great spot for covert ops and meat cooked on a spool.
