Seems appropriate in the wake of Black Friday and Cyber Monday that I just stumbled onto what initially looked like a great deal, but ended up being a letdown.\n\nCafe Presse is a little shop in a corner of the Grand Canal Shoppes. It's somewhat near SUSHISAMBA and Table 10, and there are both elevators to the Palazzo self-parking garage and elevators to some hotel rooms at that intersection.\n\nThis place offers LavAzza coffee. As a relative neophyte to the ways of these roasted beans, I have no idea of the significance of the name. Because of the pricing here, I still have no idea. However, while I was doing what I thought was window-shopping, I noticed that pastries were advertised at 50% off due to the late hour. I guess that they start discounting them at around 9:00 or 9:30 PM (and stop when they close at 11).\n\nAlthough they have muffins, croissants, and muffins, the one pastry that really caught my eye was the Maple Bacon Kronut ($4.50 regular, $2.25 discounted). Per the employee, it is supplied by local shop Al's Donuts. As much as I wanted to like this, it definitely doesn't have the salty or smoky parts that I'd want from the flavor profile, and the texture was lacking in both a crispy flakiness and a soft interior. I can't imagine that it would have tasted miles better when fresh, so I'll probably avoid that shop if I get on another donut kick.\n\nI do tend to visit the Palazzo fairly often when my mom plays slots (pretty strong cocktails available via cocktail waitresses, by the way), so perhaps I'll keep this place in the back of my mind for relatively cheap late night pastries. You won't find better prices on the Strip, but you'll probably find higher quality.
