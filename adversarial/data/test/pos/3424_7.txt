An absolutely beautiful community, inside and out.  From the moment you drive in, you can tell the crew takes care of their grounds and has pride in their community.  The layouts of the units are spacious and modern.  The office staff is top notch old fashion customer service.  Lots of amenities as well.  Definitely worth a tour to see for yourself!
