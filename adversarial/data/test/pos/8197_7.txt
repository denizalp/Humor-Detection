AESTHETIC GOALS are the two words that best describe V de V. It is the perfect place to get cute decor for your Mile End Apt. They have a nice selection of planters and succulents. They also have a great selection of bags and jewelry. I would come here to get some unique gifts for the holiday season at reasonable prices. If I had my dream apartment I would deck it out with items from V de V. \n\nTip: they also have other locations in Toronto.
