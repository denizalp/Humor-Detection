~~~This is a Chocolate Love Story~~~~~\n\nOnce upon a time, a bald man name Max Brenner came up with a brilliant idea to develop a restaurant that focus on chocolate and created dozens of deliciously sweet treats that attracted customers to his chocolate haven. \n\nI got my friends excited to check in out in Vegas last weekend which they were really thrilled about after seeing all the great sweet photos on yelp. When we entered the restaurant, we were immediately taken a back by the sweet and delicious smell of chocolate.. the perfumic smell of the cocoa was just heaven.. thats usually how I feel when I enter a coffee shop like Starbucks or Coffeebean. The smell of chocolate and coffee is blissful!\n\nFOOD:\n\nSpicy Chicken & 3 Cheese Pizza- Blackbeans, jalapeno, cilantro, mozzarella, cheddar, and goat cheese. Pizza was really thin but flavor was really not there. No cheesyness to the dish that you normally look for in a pizza. For some reason it reminded me of taco bell's mexican pizza.. just how it looked minus the ground meat and beans you would find at taco bell. I would not order this again. \n\nSliced and Diced Steak Pillow Panini- Char grilled and thin skirt steak tossed with diced caramelized onionson a bed of asagio cheese crips, baby spinach, roasted tomatoes, red pepper aioli with a side of waffle fries which is sprinkled with chili and cocoa powder. Waffle fries were good and prob the best part about the dish because it was freshly fried. You didn't really taste the sweetness of the cocoa powder so I think it definitely sounds more interesting then it actually taste. The sliced steak was kind of touch and didn't have much flavor or spice to it. The sauce made the bread soggy (which is a pet peeve of mine) so when I picked it up, the bottom of the bread is all wet and soggy. The panini looked good but there was definitely something lacking in this dish because it was a let down amongst the group.\n\nChocolate Hazelnutt Shake- \"Drink Me\" is labeled on the cup. This ain't as shake.. its more like.. a chocolate hazlenutt.. melted yogurt\/ice cream drink because it was SOOOO THICK. you seriously needed to suck on the straw with some force and it will get you full fast if you drink the whole thing before your meal! The shake was also really sweet too.. I passed around my drink around the table and each time someone has a taste of it, they are like \"damn.. its thick.. and really sweet.\" Total let down again and definitely looks better than it taste. \n\nThe Works Chocolate Pizza with Toasted marshmallows, peanut butter, and banana- SWEET SWEET SWEET. Crust was okay.. pretty thick and dry. I would not get this again either. \n\nDessert Crepe-  Crepe with banana, a side of choco crisps, and chocolate syrup. Crepe was good, choco syrup on the side would make your crepe too sweet but the texture of the crepe was nice and thin and good. \n\nOverall, the sweets were toO sweet for me and my friends taste and the savory dish was just \"okay\".. nothing you want to order again or made a great impression on us. Don't get me wrong, I was a fan of Max Brenner when I went to it in NY and loved the whole concept of it but for some reason it was a let down when I tried it again in Vegas. Just the price of the food and the quality and taste we received at the place just did not match. \n\nSorry Max, there isn't a happy ending to this Chocolate Love Story. You do smell good though... =P
