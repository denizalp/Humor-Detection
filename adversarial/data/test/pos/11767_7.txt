I don't usually go to the Albertson's because they don't have a Starbucks.  I was in the area yesterday and they do have a Wells Fargo branch in the store so it was convenient.\n\nOther than that, except for a different layout, it's pretty much the same as every other Albertson's in town.  I stop when I need something and I'm already in this plaza for some other reason.
