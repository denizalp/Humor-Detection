I had a very lovely meal here. The place was packed for a Friday lunch. We got to our table and the service was very good! We kindly asked for some English menus and definitely went straight to the poutines. Since this is something very uncommon in the states, I just had to try it, \n\nI ordered the lobster poutine:\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=O1ANCUUIoSMPigAujSO-4Q\n\nHoly crap, the dish was delicious. I would never have thought to put lobster with fries and sauce...but it worked. The sauce that was laid over the dish was creamy and delicious. Loved every bit of it. \n\nI would suggest coming in early to beat the crowd and just enjoy your meal.
