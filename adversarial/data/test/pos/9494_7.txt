Hugely disappointed in this new restaurant on 7th Ave after I'd heard a little buzz about it. Although they have seafood throughout the menu, we were informed they don't serve seafood because they have too small a kitchen to handle it. Ordered veggie quesadillas (which the server said were excellent) only to be told later they've removed it from the menu. They offer beef and chicken fajitas but can't hold it and call it veggie? Asked for fajita vegetables on the side which turned out to be a dish of saut√©ed onions. These guys are in one of the hottest areas for new restaurants in the city, so they better get it together if they're going to survive. By the way, the space is beautifully decorated. Perhaps they should've diverted more thought to the menu for non-meat eaters and (apparently) the kitchen size.
