Great little hole in the wall spot. Stopped in for lunch and the service was prompt. I ordered the fattoush with grilled chicken and it was tasty! Along with a side of hot sauce and I was very happy with it.\n\nOverall, less expensive, but just as good as Aladdin's. We also ordered the lentil soup with chicken and that was delicious!  The decor isn't much, but for a quick lunch, it was great.
