This salon continues to rock. There are many reviews on here saying how the employees are rude. I have never experienced this and I come here often. I never feel rushed and each time my nails looks beautiful . The owner is always there making sure everyone is doing their job.  Yes the salon is busy and may look messy but they also have a lot of employees working. I never have to wait which is awesome. I highly recommend this place. If you are not happy they will fix it.
