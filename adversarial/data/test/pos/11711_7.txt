This should be zero stars. Well the food was good until... We left Le Bistro and caught the owner urinating out in the side parking lot. He was shocked, embarrassed, he laughed and then ran inside to get away from us. Now my wife and I are disgusted with the whole place. I know Kevin was shocked also due to the fact he just spoke to us so he knows we were just inside eating his food. Yuck. What a bad day.
