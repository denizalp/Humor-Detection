It takes a lot to keep the well-oiled machine that is Horse Dog (aka my pet great dane) running smoothly. Horse Dog goes though dog beds about every month or so, and he requires state-of-the-art industrial toys, as he can destroy anything (including tires, couch cushions or shoes) in a matter of seconds. \n\nJust when I thought that Horse Dog was also going to consume my wallet as a result of his high-priced needs, I drove by Ryan's Pet Supplies and decided to stop in. Wholesale? Pet Supplies? In a world of overpriced PETCOs and PetSmarts, this place is now my savior.\n\nSince their warehouse is Home Depot sized, things were a little bit hard to find at first. I was overwhelmed by aisle after aisle of boxes stacked on shelves towering to the celling. Luckily the staff members here are incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and accessible. They were more than happy to guide me through the store, answer my questions and open \/ search through box after box until I found exactly what I wanted. \n\nUltimately I decided to purchase a massive human femur sized dog bone for only $9, and a giant industrial rope knot for a mere $8. My jaw dropped when the casher rang me up for a whopping grand total of $17. I would have spent well over $50 had I purchased these two items elsewhere.  \n\nAnd it gets even better. Ryan's also has a catalog, so I can call ahead and phone in my order. It's like take-out for dog supplies. Plus if they don't have what your looking for, they can get it for you within a weeks time so you don't have to waste a trip there. \n\nAlso, as a note to the ladies (or men too if you've got your murse in tow), they don't allow purses or bags of any kind into the warehouse. I didn't know this the first time I walked in, so they flagged me down upon my entrance. They lock your purses up in little cages, or they say you can leave it in your car...but um hello...have you seen that area?! So it's perfectly safe under the watchful eye of the cashiers. And if you seriously think that these employees are going to steal something from your purse, that they lock in a cage, in area equipped with video cameras, then you are overly paranoid.   \n\nRyan's is the king of pet stores, and I'm one happy dog owner because of it.
