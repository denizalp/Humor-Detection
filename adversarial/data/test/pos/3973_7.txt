Absolutely love this place. I would come here almost every weekend with one of my closest friends. Their hookah is amazing, always smooth. The staff is great and knowledgable about hookah and smoking. \nWe only came here to smoke, but their menu looks delicious. \nSince we used to be somewhat of \"regulars\" they served us a plate of fries on the house - how lovely of them and the fries were great!\n\nOverall, I love this place and simply wish I had the time to visit more frequently!
