I'm gonna have to chime in here since I actually enjoy the food here. The place, for the most part, is still pretty new... and I had no problems with the service here. The novelty of the place is funny, and it is what it is. Gimmick with the hospital gown, nurses as the waitresses, and even a doctor wandering about.\n\nThough.. there are some words of warning... they serve unhealthy food... THAT'S THE POINT... nothing is healthy here... so why would they serve diet soda? Yea.. they have water now because restaurants are always required to serve it.. but you have to buy a bottle ($2).. ok.. it sucks.. it's just a regular 16.9 oz bottle of water you can get a big case of 24 for like $5 at a grocery store.. (so $2 is a major ripoff..)\n\nSo, if you want water.. I'd say just bring in a bottle of your own (not sure if they'd let you, but shoot... I'd sneak in one for whatever.).. Just be prepared ahead of time.\n\n... and it's CASH ONLY. another downer and something you need to be prepared for.. The atm there charges $0.75 and at least for me.. isn't that bad... though it's best if you remember to bring in cash in the first place.\n\nI love bacon. It's a wonderful thing... so when I found out they had tons of it in their burger.. as well as the fries being fried in lard... HELL YEAH I was excited. If people are grossed out about that... sorry.. you can go elsewhere. And the butter fat shakes.. again.. it's unhealthy.. of course it's on the menu...\n\nso again.. if you're grossed out by it... don't order it.. DUH... and btw, i had one made with chocolate.. it was DELICIOUS... you wanna call it gross? fine.. go eat some broccoli with some non-fat ranch dressing.\n\nBTW, I went yesterday evening and enjoyed the food enough to come back again tonight. Is it wrong to promote obesity by giving people free food if they weigh over 350 lbs? I actually find that disturbing... but hey.. the food here is good.. and I won't argue about that.
