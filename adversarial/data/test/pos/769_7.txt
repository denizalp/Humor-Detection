Excellent care at this office.  Always on time and very thorough oral care from office staff to hygienist to drs.  Staff is very personable...they always make my dreaded appointment as pleasurable as possible.  Dental hygienist all work with your dental fears.  I am a nervous wreck even for a cleaning and they do everything to make it comfortable for me.  Highly recommend.
