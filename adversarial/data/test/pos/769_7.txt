First authentic HK dessert place in Montreal! You can't imagine how excited I was about this place and yet it still met my expectations.\n\nI have been 3 times so far and have tried a few things:\n- Egg waffle with black sesame ice cream: SO GOOD. Especially the waffle part. The bubbles were chewy and the thin parts were crispy, a special texture that makes the uniqueness of bubble waffles. I personally like it with half-melted ice cream, so that the waffle soaks in a bit of the ice cream. Hmmmmm\n- Tiramisu mille crÃªpe cake: the presentation is beautiful and impressive, but the taste not as much. Especially for the price. The cream in between the crepes was a bit too heavy for my taste and not sweet enough.\n- Chilled mango sago cream with pomelo: mango and pomelo pieces and sago in a mango smoothie. I would have liked it a bit sweeter, but the portion was very good.\n\nThe service was pretty good, but be prepared to wait. If you're taking out, a waffle can take them 15 minutes to make...\n\nWould definitely go back for the waffles and to try the durian flavoured goods!
