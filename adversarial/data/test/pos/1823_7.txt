Rosati's has some of the best frozen custard I've ever had! It's so smooth and creamy and wonderful, and I love that it's always so fresh. They're a little pricier than some other ice cream places, but it's nothing unreasonable and definitely worth it.\n\nI always check their flavor calendar online so that I can stop by and pick up a quart of my favorites, which include their lemon meringue pie, pumpkin pie,  \"Grandma's Cookie\" (hahaha), and sea salt caramel. Seriously, the sea salt caramel is AMAZING and you need to try it.
