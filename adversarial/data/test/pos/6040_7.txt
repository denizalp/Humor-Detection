This is the perfect example of a time I wish there was a 'half star' policy. That doesn't happen to me very often as I'm rather opinionated and deliberate and honestly, in the interest of maintaining those qualities, I just can't give Stingray 3+ stars...so 2 it is. \n\nWhere to begin.\nThe food was fine...  Choosing to dine at a place like Stingray, I'm well aware of what I've signed up for. Meaning pedestrian, cookie cutter, 'safe' sushi, with lots of rolls covered in some form of mayo or sweet eel sauce. Nothing you can't douse in loads of wasabi soy sauce and call 'okay'.  Very RA-esque or Kona style stuff we're talking about here. I actually like that kind of easypeasy 'sushi' sometimes. Just bring me more wine so I can google eye at my fiance across the table and we're fine. That said, the experience was still severely lacking in many areas. \n\nSomeone needs to tell the staff at Stingray that it's no longer 2004. Everything from the decor to the servers uniforms to their air of pretension screamed mortgage boom. A time when everyone thought they were millionaires in training, had $850 a month car payments, raging strip club habits and not a lick of common sense. Guess what guys, those days are long gone. \n\nThe service was just plain not good. Think pretty and vapid. All style (though, honestly, there was no real 'style' going on) and no substance. What I can only assume was the manager dropped our check off and didn't  look in our direction or say a word. It was rude and weird, almost as if we should feel special to be ALLOWED to dine in their establishment. Our server appeared to be pretty young and I try to give a little leeway to the young and dumb but it was pretty evident that the young part was coincidental. She was a dolt, complete with eyes rolling around in her head like creepy little black marbles....ugh. How this girl has survived on the planet this long is beyond me, what with busy streets to cross and rohypnol availability and all. I dunno, the whole thing was just uncomfortable and strange. Luckily as soon as we walked out the door all was restored with the universe. It was 2011 again, we were all poor, people were still being foreclosed on and I was still 35...meh. Whatever, I was glad to be living in the present and I doubt I'll time travel via Stingray Sushi again anytime soon.
