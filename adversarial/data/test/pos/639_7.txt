It's funny how she has 5 stars and one person gave her one star? This is most certainly an outlier. If you ever studied statistics then you know this is not representative of the sample. \n\nMiss T is awesome. She is really kind and gentle. She knows what she is doing and by no means does she double dip or anything else questionable. She cuts her wax wands in half and uses them once. Who ever gave her a bad rating must have been having a bad day :( \n\nI went for waxing today (full arm, leg and brow) I am absolutely satisfied. When I am in town this is the only place I plan to go to. She was so thorough and it really showed that she cares about her work. \n\nI can not say enough good things about Miss T and her little shop. If you go to her for a treatment you will not regret it.
