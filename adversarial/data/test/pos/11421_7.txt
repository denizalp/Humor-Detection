Warning: Unless you are a tourist looking to just put rounds down the range, steer clear of this place! \n\nAlso they are not military friendly at all. If you are a service member looking to purchase, prepare to be drug through the mud and eventually be turned away because these guys do not know gun laws pertaining to military sales. \n\nMy story began when my husband decided that he wanted to purchase our family a rifle. We went to a couple of stores and eventually ended up at The Range. Turns out they had the exact model we were interested in. We decided to buy from them because they seemed nice at the time and this would prevent us from having to order one or pay a transfer fee. The nightmare began at the beginning of the paperwork. We had some questions regarding some of the items as we are a military family. We have bought weapons before from various other gun stores in the area but have always been advised as to how to fill out the portions affected by our military status. We made sure they knew our situation and asked questions regarding the paperwork. Our clerk asked the GM twice for help on the paperwork then she assured us we were right in the manner it was filled out. Turns out they were wrong. They had informed us incorrectly and therefore the sale could not go through. We were very upset and started to provide solutions on how we could fix this. They did not want to hear it and just kept reiterating that they would not sell to us and that it wasn't their fault, even though it was their mistake and their mishandling. \n\nThe clerk then informed us that we would have to pay the $25 processing fee. Um no. So we asked for the GM. He came out and immediately started interrupting my husband as he was trying to explain where the issue was. The GM during the course of the conversation said that he did not expect his employees to know any gun laws or how to handle gun sale forms or military sales. He also said that it was our responsibility as the customer to know how to fill out all paperwork and laws and that they could not help with the form what so ever. We found this odd as, again, we have bought before and had other stores help us with the paperwork. We brought this up and were shot down. I will say this, the GM did agree to eat the $25 for us and we did not end up having to pay. So that is to their credit. \n\nWe left their store very angry and upset. We ended up winding our way down the road to Guns and Ammo Garage. We immediately were greeted with smiles and the clerks there remembered us from our last transaction with them. We talked to them about the paperwork and what had happened over at The Range and they confirmed that we could be sold to (obviously) and that everything that was said in regards to paperwork was incorrect. \n\nMoral of the story: avoid The Range like the plague and head to a gun store that actually knows what they are doing. \n\n\nUpdate: Two days later we purchased a firearm from a gun store in town with no problems. The process, from the time we walked in to the time we left, took less than 15 minutes. Further proof that if you intend to buy, forgo The Range and go somewhere reputable that actually knows how sell to guns.
