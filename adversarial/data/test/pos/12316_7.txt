We came here last night for their 90s hip hop night! It was my friend's birthday and we all dressed up in 90s attire and came to Crescent to dance our hearts out! Crescent Ballroom has lots of great shows and if you love music, you should definitely make a visit! :) Since there are regular shows, you can expect a cover charge. Last night it was $5 per person. Some shows with popular artists actually have tickets so be sure to check out their website before going to make sure that you're prepared ahead of time! \n\nIt can get pretty packed but the bars always have multiple bartenders and they're usually pretty on top of the crowd! I also love that they have music videos and movies playing on the walls, it creates such a fun vibe. It is the perfect place in Downtown Phoenix to come with a group and\/or celebrate a special occasion! I know that we'll be back again soon!
