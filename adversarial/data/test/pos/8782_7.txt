For this particular visit I ordered through the app to skip the line. It was estimated to be ready in 30 minutes but it was already waiting for me in the fridge before then! Ordering through the app will also automatically give you a stamp on your mobile stamp card within 24 hours. After 10 visits, you'll receive one free item off the menu. \n\nAll locations are very cute with their collage of vibrant picture posters on the wall. \nTheir pitaya bowls are my favorite! If you want it in drink form - order a Pink Flamingo smoothie. \nJuices are always pricy wherever you go. I appreciate that Nekter has three different sizes to choose from and that you're able to build your own concoction with customized bases and ingredients. (If you love it, favorite the recipe on your app so you don't forget it!)
