Horrible service. One of the ladies didn't understand English, but gladly I spoke Chinese. She tried scamming us in Cantonese saying that the student deal costed $10, which the poster clearly said $6.50. Then we pointed at the poster and she was like OKAY you're supposed to order saying the number. So we ordered and she said it was $8. Eventually we needed another waitress to come take our order who ACTUALLY understood English. It appeared that she came up with arbitrary prices by her head...  She has really bad manners as she talked to us with a rude attitude when we questioned the price. I don't really feel like coming again. This ruined my day
