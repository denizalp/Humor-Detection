Christmas in Vegas is quite different and one thing that I noticed was lots and lots of people were doing the same as well!! \n\nI thought the room was alright and the bathroom as quite nice what I didn't like was how slow service was. I mean I guess I should give them a little bit of slack since it was during the Christmas time. \n\nThis place had one thing that made it very pretty: The nice little decorations of polar bears which was made with flowers and all the decorations for Christmas. \n\nI had a good time here, but it just wasn't what everyone makes it out to be. It wasn't that crazy of a place...but it was still a-ok for my trip.
