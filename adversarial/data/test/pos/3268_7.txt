Great Experience!\n\nI always have a great time when I go to a Diamond Backs game here. \n\nThis place is huge, and offers comfortable seating. They have restaurants and bars spread all around this place which is really nice!\n\nI also like the fact that it doesn't take long to find a bathroom, and they are never over crowded. \n\nWhat I really love about watching base ball here is that they are marquees all over the place that show statistics during the game! The main screen is huge and has a great picture. \n\nI can't wait to go to another Diamond Backs game!!
