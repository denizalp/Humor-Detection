My cousins took me here after getting some groupons so we could try somewhere new.\n\nSimply,  was a bummer on many levels. food was about on par with grocery store or airport sushi, service was the worst I've ever experienced (after forgetting over half our order, they ignored us and the hungry kids for forty minutes),no utensils, no napkins, just bad,\n\nThe highlight of the evening had to be when my cousing chowed down on glass. Yes,that's right, they served him a SHARD OF GLASS in his sushi pizza.\n\nThis place shouldnt be, save yourself, don't eat there.
