We came here on Sunday at 11am and as expected it was PACKED. For 2 we had a 35-45 minute wait and once we sat down the wait for 2 was up to 1.5 hours! That only told me that this place MUST be good. The girl taking names was good at seating everyone on the inside but o think she may have forgotten about the outside table because the table we sat at was empty the 40 minutes we were waiting and it wasn't but 10 minutes before we were called that someone took a count of the tables out there. But it was a busy day.\n\nWe were greeted almost immediately and the first thing we wanted were pomegranate mimosas but nope they don't serve alcohol till noon which is very strange for a place that has a good list of brunch alcoholic beverages. At least start it at 11am but I think this may be a permitting issue. Anyway we asked that at 11:45 so waiting a bit didn't bother us. My mom and I ordered build your own omelets and wanted the famous red velvet waffle to share. Our waffle came out way before our omelets which was also strange but not the worst thing to happen. At 11:59 our waitress asked us if we wanted to order the mimosas and we appreciated her promptness. The mimosas were delicious! Highly recommend the pomegranate! \n\nMy favorite part of the brunch was one of the bus boys sang while he cleaned the tables and let me tell you he has a great voice! We enjoyed our time here and would definitely return!
