Note: this review pertains to their reverse happy hour.\n\nThe Skinny: Truly the food here is comme ci, comme ca (as the French say \"so-so\") (3), service: friendly and pretty efficient (3), value: holy smokes, the serving sizes here are ridiculously large. For the quality and quantity, it's a good value even though there are issues with execution(3.5).\n\nWe came here because of their excellent deal on their reverse happy hour (1\/2 price on their bar menu which starts at 10 pm). We ordered the Comme ca burger, the Provence Country Salad, the Charcuterie plate and the Roasted Bone Marrow with oxtail jam.\n\nI want to say something to start - the serving sizes are massive, certainly worth every penny on that criteria alone. Our order could have easily fed 4 more people. The salad came in a large bowl the size of a small washbasin. My hubby couldn't even get his mouth around the burger (trust me, it's a rare thing). \n\nNormally that would be a great thing if the food was good. Unfortunately, due to execution issues, it just doesn't make the cut.\n\nThe much lauded Comme Ca burger was a huge disappointment. Sporting a thicker good quality patty, the beef was terribly underseasoned (ie, lacking enough salt for one). The addition of a rather goopy, oddly sour slaw on top of the already bland meat added insult on top of injury. The fries were lackluster texturally (not crispy!) although the garlic aioli was okay.\n\nThe bone marrow with fleur de sel was great - very rich and decadent. However the accompanying oxtail jam was overly salty.  Definitely stuck between a rock and a hard place with the bread - you need bread to mellow out the richness of the bone marrow, but the bread you're served is a dentist's wet dream (ie, too hard by far).\n\nThe charcuterie plate was faired better  - a large serving of interesting rich house pates and meats.However, it was again served with that terrible bread which definitely a big minus in my book.\n\nFinally, the salad. The salad was large and filling. There was perhaps a little too much acidity with the dressing and could have used a tinge more sweetness to mellow it out.\n\nI am definitely conflicted about the meal at Comme Ca. On the one hand, it's a fantastic deal given the portion sizes and the quality of the ingredients. But on the other, execution issues mar the value of the coming here. Overall, it evens out to a three starred review.
