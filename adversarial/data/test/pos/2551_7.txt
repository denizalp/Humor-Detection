This showroom can easily be passed by due to the fact that its right across from the Rock of Ages theater. Located a floor below all the shopping stores and gondola rides, this place is just past the main casino inside The Venetian Hotel and Casino.\n\nI have seen David Spade, Joan Rivers, and just recently Rita Rudner perform here. Human Nature, a motown group that is produced by motown legend himself Smoky Robinson, also performs here as well.\n\nThis theater reminds me of the same theater that the Jabbawockeez perform at which is at The Luxor. Very similar except for a couple of things like stairs. The theater itself can probably seat about 400 people. The sound and lighting is pretty good based on the amount of seating capacity that is available. The seats are pretty comfortable and have cupholders for your drinks.\n\nSince I have been here several times you would think that there would be business listing already but no so here it is along with the first review. Im sure I will be back here for more future events.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #159
