So I noticed a few things that were out of the ordinary for your typical spa. I went in for a flotation tank session (sensory deprivation tank). First of all.. The lady at the front was, I believe, high on some kind of stimulant. Twitchy, jittery, nervous, shifty eyed, etc. I'd be fine with a stoned person at a place for relaxation, but it was a bit weird to find a tweaker behind the front desk.\n\nI was eventually lead to the room with my tank. You shower before and after you float. This lady was in the room with me for an awkward amount of time and didn't even tell me I had to sign a release form before using the tank (I didn't see the form until after I had finished). HERE is one of my main complaints though. The LACK of cleanliness. The floor mat to the shower was wet and used before I had the chance to make it wet and used... Gross. There was a hair on the wall of the shower that was not my own. The shower head wasn't properly installed so it was spraying out of the side bit where it was screwed in. No shower shoes\/sandals. And no direct on how to actually use the tank properly.\n\nNow for all of you sensory deprivation tank enthusiasts out there this little paragraph is for you. This place runs their tanks warm. Like 94-96 warm. If you have done your research you know this is not how it works. The tank was not totally silent, nor was it totally dark... Bot are big no no's when trying to properly deprive your brain of sensory input. Given the state of the room\/shower it may be safe to assume the cleanliness of the tank was not up to my or your standards. \n\nOverall it wasn't the worst experience. I was determined to enjoy my first float and despite Optimal Wellness's very best efforts of putting in no effort I think I was able to achieve that. I had some great visuals while in the tank (smokey clouds of violet and indigo dancing around, memories were recalled quickly and in incredibly vivid detail, a very strong sense of relaxation... To the point where breathing was a chore.)\n\nGive them a chance. I might have just been there on the day a disgruntled employee was taking care of things. I really did enjoy myself. I've just been in really nice spas on vacation and stuff so I noticed the shortcomings more than I believe your average folk would.
