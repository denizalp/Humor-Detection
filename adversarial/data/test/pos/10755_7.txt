Oh my goodness guys what happened? My go-to place for samosas and Indian sweets let me down last night and made us sick.\n\nOrdered samosas for our movie date to see Jason Bourne at Cineplex, judge me if you must for sneaking in food haha, but I'm sure we've all done it before. $8.00-$12.00 on nachos, popcorn is not my thing. Grabbed a masala dosa, first time trying and headed back to the movie. Snuck in the food with no trouble, mazel tov!. \n\nHowever after eating the dosa and some samosas, halfway through the movie, my stomach started to disagree with me, then came the nauseousness, gassy stomach of mine that growled non-stop. Thank goodness I went to see an action movie, so no one heard the King Kong wrecking havoc in my abdomen. Couldn't finish the movie, had to find a washroom and went home to rest before I felt any worse. \n\nTo dispute any doubt, I felt fine till eating from Samosa King. I don't want to have this experience again so I unfortunately won't be returning to Samosa King, exercise caution if you pickup food from here. Very disappointing!
