I enjoy hip & cool downtown hotels as much as the next guy, but when I'm traveling because I have to, as opposed to wanting to, I go for the most bang for the buck. The Drury brand is pretty hard to beat. \n\nThis particular Drury at the Phoenix airport sits in a row of similar mid-rate hotel chains, and it comes down to what amenities are important to you. I'm big on Drury's fast & free WiFi and their daily three-hour hot breakfast buffet, and the 24\/7 airport shuttle & lobby coffee service is a big plus too. (The one-cup in-room coffee things just make me laugh.) I've never taken advantage of their weekday \"Three-drink with Bar Food\" complimentary evening deal, but I can't imagine it's all that bad. Especially if you like three drinks and bar food. \n\nIt pretty much comes down to great beds, soft sheets, and while you're not going to get manly-man showerhead pressure here, I get they're being efficient, and not hearing everyone else showering within a three-room radius is a bonus too. I didn't rent a car and use their free parking either, but Ubered & Lyfted my way through all parts of Phoenix. The most expensive ride cost me $25. \n\nOne last thing - I rarely see the same staff at upscale trendster hotels, but a couple of days at this Drury and the people working here and I were calling each other by name. I never got the feeling it was just showbiz, I think they were genuinely interested in how my day was going. I could be wrong, but it was a nice touch. And it makes me a fan.
