From the Jerusalem kids next door comes Aly Baba - all the cheap, tasty hits (falafel, shawarma, kebab, etc) in a sit-down, less linoleumed setting. \n\nStill 4 bucks and still my fav in town - ze falafel. One of only a couple veggie staples on the menu but a sweet rendition - 3 fried chickpea balls, chopped tomato, hummus, pickles, hot sauce, wrapped in lavash like a mini burrito, 4 bucks. If you're eating this on the go, you're going to need napkins (pita-stuffed 'lafel doesn't suffer this fate, rawr). Hummus and ganoush delish. A larger, more comprehensive (read:meatfull) menu for the rest of ya.\n\nService smiley and efficient. Palatial side yard full of running fountains, wrought iron and stonework - comfy and gorgeous, with some goldfish darting around for added awesome factor.\n\nWe lost a rad Viet place. But this'll do just fine when the falafel need hits.
