I needed to satisfy my craving for ceviche and didn't want to drive across town to our usual spot, I was looking for places near home and Pariente's popped up, it was nearby and had decent ratings so why not, right? \n\nMy boyfriend and I stopped by on a Saturday night, the place was completely dead and there was only one other table occupied. When we first walked in we didn't get any hello's or acknowledgements, despite someone seeing us walk in, we didn't know if we had to seat ourselves or if we had to wait for someone to seat us since there were no signs posted, after a minute or two, a lady who I assume is the owner told us we could sit anywhere we wanted. \n\nI ended up ordering two ceviche tostadas and my boyfriend ordered one ceviche tostada and a few tacos. The tostadas were definitely lacking, they were packed with vegetables and almost no shrimp, it was such a disappointment. Service was almost non-existential here, we weren't really checked on so it's something they really need to work on. Michelada's were simple and served in oversized glasses, just beer, clamato, and tajin on the rim. They were little on the pricier side I'd say compared to other places who do a little more to spice them up. \n\nNow the reason behind my one star review and the reason why I won't be returning..Unfortunately my boyfriend and I got a bad case of food poisoning with me getting a more severe case of it with all the works. I think I ended up getting the more severe case because I stuck to seafood for my meal. If you've ever had food poisoning, you know what a miserable time you have, I ate nothing the next day and spent the day in bed because I couldn't keep anything down. Terrible first meal here.
