I was having another pork bone soup craving last night, so I came here with a friend.\n\nService was fine, and they had beer, so yay!\n\nThe pork bone soup was adequate. It was spicy enough and the broth was pretty flavourful, and the potato wasn't too huge. The pork on the other hand, was kind of hard to get off the bone (that's what she said) and kind of tasteless. It tasted like most of the flavour had boiled away. \n\nMy friend had a rice cake dish which he enjoyed. \n\nThe place was full when i got there at 7, most people had hot plate dishes. Perhaps I'll try that next time.
