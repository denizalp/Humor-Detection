The first time I went here, I didn't come away feeling very satisfied mostly because I'm cheap at times. I spent nearly $7 on a cookie and a \"winkie.\" The winkie was good but it wasn't *that* good. I was sorta sulking about that and didn't think I'd go back. But alas, on my next visit, I got one of their Dairy-Queen-like \"Tsoynamis\" and damn if that stuff isn't crack. I went back a second time in four days because I had to have some of that cream, non-dairy goodness. I had a PB-Chocolate one and more recently a 'Smores one with marshmallow fluffer. Good stuff. I like the coconut milk better in some ways. Anyway, I have to be careful around that place but I mean that in a good way.
