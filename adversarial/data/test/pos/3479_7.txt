No stars would be better. My wife and I went in together for haircuts and her an additional color treatment. She was steamrolled over by her 'student' who proclaimed that she loves cutting long hair 'snip snip'. My wife cautiously explained she only wants a little taken off. And the student proceeded to absolutely trash her hair. She talked like she was high on speed and cut hair the same way. My wife was devastated at the results. She called afterwards to complain and promised the head instructor that she wouldn't say the students name on a review... But I have made no such promise. I don't care is it ruins her 'promising' career. She was careless with my wife so I will be careless in this review. Her name was Theresa. Btw: my haircut was not good, but at least the student and the instructor were pleasant.
