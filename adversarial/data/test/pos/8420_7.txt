Every time I enter the Golden Tiki I have to remind myself that I am not going to Disney Land. I usually feel like I'm about to stand in line for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, but I'm pleasantly surprised that there is little to no line that awaits a yummy tropical drink. The Dole Whip Float with Rum once again jolts me into Disney Land mode, but I sit back and relax, reminding myself that no screaming children are about to ruin my experience. \n\nThe space is large with lots of seating options. One seating option, most likely occupied on busy nights, is a giant pink clam created specifically for the selfie lover. (Picture provided for reference)\n\nThe bar also acts as a venue for fun DJs such as Viva la Vivi who will play tunes that will definitely get you moving.
