Town Square is a beautiful open air mall located just a few minutes away from the Las Vegas Strip.  The buildings are spread apart like an actual town.  There are three parking garages and you can even find some parking stalls between and around the mall buildings.  My first trip here lasted about 10 minutes as it was during the summer and it was unbearable to walk around in the desert heat.  My next trip to Las Vegas was a few months later where the weather was nice and I was comfortably walking around this outdoor mall in 50 degree weather.  I imagine that this mall makes a lot more money during the winter season as it's almost intolerable to walk around the mall the in the triple-digit weather.  \n\nThe buildings are really nice and being at Town Square really makes you feel like you're in an actual town.  In the middle of the mall, you'll find Town Square Park and children's park.  The children's park is perfect during the summer because not only does it have a treehouse, slides, a castle and a hedge maze, but it has a jet fountain where kids (I've seen adults too) can cool off.  It's basically an open area where water shoots out of the ground so if you plan to go on a hot day, bring extra clothes.  The mall is really well-maintained and clean, which is just one of the things that I really appreciated about being there.      \n\nThere are a few eateries in the middle of the mall near the park and the children's play area.  These are mainly snack shops (Wetzel's Pretzels, Nestle Toll House Cafe, etc.) and after my first, brief visit I thought they were lacking in restaurant choices.  After my second visit, I found the other restaurants near the theater.  Yes, this mall has a theater too!  It really is like a \"town\" where you can get everything.  What's that?  You need groceries too?  Check!  There's a Whole Foods in Town Square.  I think that the AMC movie theater and Whole Foods are just the cherry on top to go along with all of the other good stores they have like H&M, Staples, Oakley and Aldo.  So if you're looking for a really nice outdoor mall without all of the hustle and bustle of The Strip, I definitely recommend going to Town Square.
