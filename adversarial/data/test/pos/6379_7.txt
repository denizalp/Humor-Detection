I love the setting.. it's in a little alley way..as a previous yelper described.. it's very Parisian! \n\nWe were greeted with a luke warm welcome.. once our actual waitress came out to take our order, the service really went up. \nThe hookah didn't hit well at first, but eventually we got it. \n\nSome strange stuff was happening when we first arrived...seems like a popular hangout for teens. When we sat down upstairs (by the way they have an upstairs if you're like us and are completely oblivious haha) this group of kids were upstairs playing a weird ass game where you rock paper scissors then smack the crap out of each other. Yeah, no. \nThe lights were also super bright and the tv was going all white noise. The waitress fixed both of those and turned the room into a nice chill atmosphere to hookah. \n\nOther than the hit-show, we enjoyed ourselves.
