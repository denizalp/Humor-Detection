I can't believe Brassaii has become the douchiest place possible.  \nslight exaggeration, but not by much.\n\nYou guys, let me school you on Brassaii- back in the day it used to be honestly a grade A restaurant.  Good value, good scene. just a great place for all meals- honestly.  Then for some reason they started to become more a club than a restaurant.  They became much more known for their high end pretentious fake-it-til-you-make-it crowd and then now everything THINKs its just a club.  and heck... that's pretty much what it will end up being, I guess.  But for THAT, I will have to demote it.\n\nI can't even BELIEVE I gave it 5 stars before.. and now it stands at a pathetic 2.\nI came here reluctantly for a birthday party.  I knew what the vibe was going to be like because I HAVE seen what it has turned into over the years.  Douche-city (aka- my money replaces my personality).  \nSaid birthday boy got bottle service.  Gah..I don't know why ANYONE gets bottle service in Toronto.  This isn't Vegas or LA, people.  You still ARE going to get into the club.  Unless you are a large group of dudes there is no real benefit of getting bottle service in Toronto EVER.\nThere was like..no waitress attendant in sight. Ever.  So bottle service at Brassaii meant that they drop off some expensive bottles at your table and then you get to sit down for a bit and pretend it's your exclusive space when really anyone else sits there.\n\nAnd my BIGGEST concern with this place is that NOBODY ACTUALLY DANCES.  They just kind of stand around in their overly-done outfits, unnecessarily uncomfortable shoes and try to look pretty when, in fact they are getting so wasted that they end up leaving the bar trashed out, makeup running down their face, false eyelashes lifting off their eyes; shirts and dresses falling off; super pushup bras starting to befcome more visible than their shirt and bare foot because they finally realize their shoe choice for the night was terrible.\n\nok, so maybe this rant goes for ANY place in the club district.  But what really gets me is that Brassaii honest to god used to be a GOOD restaurant in its own right and on its own.  And they ruined that.  So much fail.\n\nBahumbug.
