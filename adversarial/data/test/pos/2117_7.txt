Just awful. Absolutely awful.\n\nThe theme of this place is interesting but besides that there's absolutely no reason to go here. Any other burger place would be a better choice. \n \nThe burgers were indeed large but the bacon was ice cold and the quality of the meat left much to be desired. And to top it all off, they spank you if you don't finish their terrible food. \n\nInteresting theme and cute waitresses aside, there's no reason to ever subject your stomach to this awful food.
