My new favorite breakfast place...of all time and everywhere!\n\nLove the central location, love the cute decor (especially all the letters and envelops under the table glass, with the adorable mason jars with candy canes on them.) I liked the order process as well (sounds silly I know) but I like how you walk in and the counter to order is right there, you quick look at the menu, and you order and pay all at once. \n\nI ended up getting a Mimosa, and the Breakfast Burrito. Both so fantastic. The Mimosa was the perfect blend of Orange Juice and Champagne...I downed it pretty fast. And the burrito was pretty good, came with Guac, sour cream, hot sauce, and your choice of Potatoes, Toast, or a tossed greens. I wish I had opted out of the potatoes, and went with the toast. Just wasn't a huge fan of them I guess.  \n\nOver all pretty great experience at Short Stack, loved how open it was, and how sweet the staff all were, and the great food as well. Trying out the breakfast sandwich or Pancakes next time though! :)
