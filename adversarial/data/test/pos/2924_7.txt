I LOVE MEXICANS.... I MEAN MEXICAN FOOD!\n\nPepe's compared to Roberto's. \n\nPepe's knocks this one out of the ball park. The reason being the quality of food is way better. I want it to be known that the staff here is very friendly, maybe a little to friendly I had a guy in the back winking at me.\nAlso the first time I was here one of the employees actually asked me for my number, at that time (2010) I was single and to this day I still talk to him as a good friend.\n\nOverall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.\n\nThe only thing I would do different is keep the salsa station clean.
