I love Jonathan Adler's style and have purchased stuff in his store in Boston. He is most famous for his ceramics, some of which you will find here, but along with a whole host of other home decor items. \n\nI come here mainly to find really unique gifts for the hard to buy for. I would describe the store's style as mid-century modern with a side of quirk. The staff is friendly and the store is fun to spend a few minutes in looking around even if you aren't buying.
