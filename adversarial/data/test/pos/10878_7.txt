CONSUMER WARNING - THE DEMOGRAPHIC FOR THEIR SMALL GLUTEN FREE BURRITOS ARE SPARROWS OR BABY BIRDS. THEY ARE SMALL. SO SMALL YOU WILL FEEL ENTIRELY RIPPED OFF AND USED IF YOU ARE A HUMAN WITH A NORMAL APPETITE.\n\nSeriously, why does Burrito Boyz make the BEST, but ONLY gluten free burrito in town? Why? And why is their small GF so fucking tragic? You are literally paying $7 for a snack. AND they charge you extra for the GF tortilla. This should be like four fucking dollars because the amount of filling they put in here was a joke. Did they shaft me? My boyfriend got a large chicken and maybe they were like \"Oh, fuck this, this little baby bird burrito doesn't even need chicken,\" *pours the scraps of chicken left over from the large burrito*. I had maybe a total of 3 pieces of chicken?!?!?!!? This gluten free burrito fit in the palm of my hand (yes I have larger man hands) But still!!! WHAT THE FUCK. I ate the thing in literally EIGHT BITES. Like, even their small flour tortilla burrito is a two-hand affair.\n\nI TRUSTED YOU BURRITO BOYZ. I WAS LOYAL. BUT YOU SCREWED ME. WHHHHYYYYYY.
