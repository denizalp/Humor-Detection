What an awesome park! We came to ride the holiday lights train ride and it was pretty cool. I think we liked it more than our one year old, but who cares? Haha. We will probably come back during the day time. The park was pretty packed and my daughter was getting overwhelmed so we didn't stay long, but we definitely will be back.
