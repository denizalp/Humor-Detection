This could possibly be the worst hotel I've ever done business with. I hosted a conference here on October 7. Arrived the day before to set up, and discovered that the entire front of the hotel is under major renovation. This was never mentioned to our event planner in advance. It's probably a good thing they are doing renovations, since the entire hotel is old, stagnant, and very ugly. Their website, photos, videos, and commercials are not an accurate reflection of the condition of the actual hotel.\n\nOn the day of our event, finding someone to help us, or getting anything done, was like pulling teeth. It seemed like there was no one actually dedicated to our event at all. We had prearranged special menus for certain guests who had dietary restrictions... These meals showed up half an hour after everyone else's food had been served.\n\nAfter an event, we usually ship items back to our warehouse, and any extra products get shipped to our representatives. I packed everything up, and attached all of the pre-paid waybills. One of the managers told me that he would take care of making arrangements to ensure that these packages got picked up (this is completely customary, and something that every hotel does after hosting a large event.) Today is nine days later, and I've just been told that the boxes were never picked up, and have been lost. I don't even know how this could possibly happen!\n\nAll of my guests who stayed at the hotel complained about their room's condition and cleanliness. In addition, do not expect a peaceful night's rest with airplanes landing at the airport 24 hours a day. One client texted me after she checked in and said, \"This place is ghetto.\" (She wasn't wrong.)\n\nOverall, the customer service at this hotel is a zero out of five. I will never do business with them again. Ever.
