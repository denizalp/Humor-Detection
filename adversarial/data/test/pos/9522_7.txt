This place is CHEAP!  Yet still manages to taste good.  The downfall is the service, more on that later.  Four of us ate dinner here the other night and we ordered:\n\nFish in corn sauce - Very good, fish was fried and tossed in wok with corn.\nFish and tofu hot pot - Again good, lots of fish and tofu in a gravy-like sauce.\nShrimp rice roll - Big shrimp rolled in rice noodles.\nLobster special ($9.99 after you spend $20) - flavoured well, tossed in wok with ginger and scallions.\nFish congee (rice porridge) - The one bad thing. Terrible, it tasted burnt!  \n\nNow onto the service: bad, bad, bad.  There wasn't a language barrier, either.  The girl who served us was rude beyond belief.  She obviously did not want to be working.  She threw the menus in our faces and was biatchy serving us the whole time.  We asked for some food descriptions and special requests, and she sighed and shook her head in annoyance.  She rolled her eyes when we spoke or asked for anything.  When we asked for dinner plates, she gave us saucers (but in the meantime, she gave all the other tables around us full size plates).  When I told her we wanted \"big\" plates, she grabbed back all the saucers and crash threw them all into a bin.  If we weren't eating there, I would've taken her outside for a serious smack-down.  \n\nGo for the cheap tasty food, but be prepared for server anguish.  Better yet, order take-out.  Don't order anything congee related.  Cash only, and the restaurant itself is not very clean.
