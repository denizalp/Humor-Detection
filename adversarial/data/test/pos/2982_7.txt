Came here for the lunch special, which cost $6.77 including tax. The line was quite long during lunch hours but moved quickly. It was assembly line style and everyone was ordering the same lunch special. You get a choice of jerk, bbq, or fried chicken and coleslaw or salad. It all comes with rice. I had jerk with coleslaw. It was all very good and at the right temperature. The jerk chicken had the sort of heat that builds up and congregates at the back of your mouth. Originally, I thought the portion was a bit small but I felt feel full and satisfied. My friend (who is quite a big dude) wasn't too full though. I enjoyed everything and plan to come back for lunch again. The fried chicken also looked very good as well so I'd like to try that next.
