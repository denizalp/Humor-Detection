I really enjoyed the Phoenix Zoo. My only real complaint is really just a whine.. I wish they could make an indoor zoo! In a place like Phoenix they really need one.\nThe zoo is set up great although it is a little confusing. They have cool things to do like feeding Giraffes and running through a cave like thing that sprays water on you (primarily made for little kids, but that never stops me).\nI really admire how well they take care of their animals. I had the amazing opportunity to get an up close look at the Elephants (an absolutely amazing experience), and they really take pride in what they do.\nThe best thing about zoos is that you don't just have to be a little kid to go, I know I will enjoy going to the Zoo until I am old and gray.\nThe Phoenix Zoo is a great choice... preferably not during the summer.
