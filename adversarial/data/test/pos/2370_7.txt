Clean Vietnamese places automatically get a 3 star from me. The added homage to the traditional Vietnamese cuisine gives this place a solid 4 star. You know this is \"French Vietnamese\" by the smell of butter in the air. While waiting in line, I received a free bag of baggette. The sandwiches are honkers in size. One bite of the sandwich and I know this is the place for me. Soft buttery exterior mixed with pickled daikons and well marinated meat.  I like the boba style sealed coffee because it's easy for transportation. \n\nButter, Butter, Nom Nom!
