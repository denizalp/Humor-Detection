Disclaimer  : Drunk , one too many stiff ones of Glenlivet.\nI loove this pizza joint! Why ? They have good pizza and they deliver ! Yayy! Do you know what that means to a hungry pharmacist ? It means its as close goodness as you get. I love their BBQ pizza and while their delivery takes some time, its always worth it. They guy always makes the chicken wings super spicy for my indian taste buds and viola u have a fan.. am I allowed to drunk review ? Thank god for spell check !
