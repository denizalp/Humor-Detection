Honestly I am a big fan of their corn fritters, and gravy, however after my experience with this particular store I doubt I'll be eating any of it for a long time. The lady at the till looked inconvenienced by the customers, as well as I had to repeat my order three times. Upon arriving home I noticed there was no chicken in the bags, so I called back the location and was quickly yelled at and accused of lying about my order. I understand she didn't hear me repeat the order three times, however there was no reason to yell at me or accuse me of lying. I won't be returning to a store that screams at customers for their mistakes.
