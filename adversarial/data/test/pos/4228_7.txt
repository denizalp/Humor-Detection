This place has such a big and diversified menu in terms of desserts that I wouldn't be objective to review it only based on one visit as it would take at least 5 times to get an idea and go over the whole desert menu. It was my third time, with my last one before this week maybe 2 years ago.\n\nSo based on not only my but my friends experiences, the deserts were all good, some\nof them really, and tasty, service was quick and sharp as well.
