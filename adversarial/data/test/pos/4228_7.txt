I waited SOOO long to try this place!! TOO LONG. Since my friends are party animals. I came into this buffet on an empty stomach. On an empty stomach filled with tequila and vodka! \n\nWent there exactly at 4:45 and got in, in less than 15 mins. I was already feeling like pure shit for not eating all day and drinking alcohol. Oh woe is me!\n\nThe first thing I got was...BONE MARROW. I absolutely love bone marrow...but wicked spoon...all I tasted was fat! Just all FAT. I added some chimichurri, made it taste a bit better. I knew it was all pure fat but I ended up eating....5...\n\nThis buffet wasn't up to par in my palate. I mean the design and theme is wonderful. It's super cute! the only food entree that stood out to me was the veal sliders. YUM! it was super soft meat. \n\nThe dessert was just okay too. The chocolate covered strawberries were HUGE. Where the heck did they grow those? \n\nLater that night I still felt full and sick, and couldn't even drink anymore. :( Warning here is to not eat any of that fatty bone marrow...
