This place is for suicidal fat people who do not even know how to spell d-i-e-t. Please, whatever you do, do not enter this gluten devil pit. There are sick sacrilicious jokes everywhere. They encourage bad health, and the owner even has the ashes of one person that died in the restaurant. No joke, look on youtube, and you will see a video of him admitting it. Also, many have died in his restaurants from this disgusting slop they call food!\n\nBut if you want to die, go ahead.
