Food 4.5! Nice dark ambiance for lovers. Fancy shmancy Mexican food. I ordered the trio that included Chile Relleno, enchilada (chicken) and soft beef taco (option hard shell). \n\nTo start, the chips were a tad bit salty and looked like it was fresh out of the bag. The house salsa was awesome with good heat and fresh tomatoes, herbs etc.\n\nChile Relleno is a must. The batter was very light, cheese soft and pepper was nicely grilled. The enchilada was typical with a good amount of chicken. The soft taco was very soft, and beef was nicely seasoned. Although it sounds like a mouthful, the portion size was perfect. They were half the size of what you'd get at a typical Mexican restaurant, but it was just enough. \n\nThe jalape√±o margarita was really refreshing; a bit sweet and spicy. It creeps up on you, so drink lightly. \n\nThe restaurant is located in the Aria. It's accessible from the tram. \n\nOverall, a nice restaurant. Our waitress was a bit talky with colleagues and other customers. She asked if we wanted dessert after handing over the bill. \nThe bus boy was efficient with refilling water.
