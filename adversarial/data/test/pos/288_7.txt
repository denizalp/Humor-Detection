I tried Boom J's at the taste of the Caribbean festival. I ordered a jerk chicken wrap for 8$ it was so filling and well seasoned, only thing it was too spicy for me! Which only proves it's an authentic dish. At the fair they were selling Jamaican patties, jerk chicken and exotic fruit juices. Their in house menu must be amazing as well.
