I have been going to this hotel for the last 20 years and I still remember playing all those games when I was a kid. This hotel has not changed and they still have some of the older games that I played when I was a kid. The adventure dome was my favorite place in the entire hotel because of the rides and games they had in it. This is probably the only hotel I would bring my kids to in Las Vegas because of the circus acts and all the games that they can play and have fun with.
