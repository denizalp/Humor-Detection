Too far off the strip, average price of a cab to the strip is about $15 each way. There's not a lot of places to eat and the buffet closes at 10pm.\nTheir main attraction is \"Thunder from Down Under\"....well that fine.....if you're into that!! We're not and those damn pictures of half naked guys everywhere gets irritating.
