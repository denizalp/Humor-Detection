I love this new caf√© in the neighbourhood, filling in a spot that helps unite Mile End and Mile Ex and gives a big bright, friendly, inspiring option for delicious hangs. Named after the owner's Grandma it was always already going to speak to my heart, and then the warmth of the welcome and the delicious homemade snacks made with ingredients from local producers pushed me to full swoon. I loved my little local honey bar and tasty coffee, and watching the artisans who share the space shaping hats and cutting leather made me feel inspired. Can't wait to come back and spend some time and soak in the maker vibes.
