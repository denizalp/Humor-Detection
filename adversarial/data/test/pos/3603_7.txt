Went here while on vacation in Scottsdale.  As breakfast joints go, this one is near the top of the list.  Fantastic pancakes, decent variety, and friendly staff.\n\nI even went so far as to tell my wife that it was maybe the best overall breakfast I've ever had.  That's saying a lot, considering that I use any excuse I can get to go out for breakfast.
