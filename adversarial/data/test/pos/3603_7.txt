A bit nicer than just an A-OK. \n\nProduce is hit or miss (mostly hit, believe it or not).\n\nIf you want anything for cooking Mexican food, you'll find it here, and for a cheap-o price.\n\nI haven't experienced any issues with cleanliness, unpleasant smells, or rude staff. I get smiles and chit-chat from the cashiers when checking out, and I'm clearly a white girl.\n\nI don't come often, however, as their cheese section leaves me longing for Sprouts or Trader Joe's, and apparently cheese is about 1\/3 of my diet. :)
