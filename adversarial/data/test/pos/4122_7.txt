In a restaurant wasteland this place is a godsend. There are restaurants in the area just not many good ones.. \n Everyone liked the food here. Portions are well worth the money , I'd venture to say large or fairly generous. The staff were pretty friendly. Clean and quick. Not amazing but good and reliable. Cheap eats... Worth a go.
