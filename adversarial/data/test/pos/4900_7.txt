If you can't afford a ticket overseas, this place is the next best thing. It has the best selection of International foods in all of Las Vegas. It's easy to get overwhelmed by the selection in here(in a good way) and spend more money than expected. \n   When you first walk in, it can be confusing which direction to turn, because nothing is really labeled. I always just turn right and go up an down each aisle so I see every inch. This is definitely one of those places to keep your eyes peeled because there are products everywhere, and you don't want to miss a thing. It is very likely you will come across fun things you have never seen or heard of before, which is why I always feel like I'm on vacation when I come in here. With each visit here, I try to buy at least one new thing I have never tried before.\n   My only issue here is: although they have the largest European selection of any market I have seen, I still wish it was bigger. It's takes up about an aisle and a half, whereas the Asian products are more than half the store. They have about thirty types of Spaetzle(which I love, don't get me wrong), but there are so many more amazing German products out there.\n    Last, but definitely not least, this place is a sugar lovers dream. First, their selection of Haribo candy is incredible(the best I've seen) as well as Kinder and Milka products. They have a great selection of Asian candy and frozen treats, different flavored Oreos you can't find at other markets, and a bunch of other goodies to satisfy your sweet tooth. This place is a definite must to check out.
