About as bare-bones as curry can get. One sauce, various add-ins. The sauce itself is okay; reminds me of S&B.\n\nI prefer curry with the ingredients cooked in the sauce. I also prefer curry with potatoes--the only potatoes here are the fries.\n\nThe correct address is 5051 Stewart Ave #101--the restaurant is in the strip mall facing Stewart St., south side of Stewart, west of the Nellis-Stewart intersection.
