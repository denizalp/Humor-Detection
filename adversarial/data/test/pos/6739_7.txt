This place is great for a number of reasons, but what I love the most is how quick and easy it is to order the food. Let's paint the picture: it's a Friday night and I don't feel like cooking since  I'd rather play with my super cute daughter... so, I go to their website, order WAY too much sushi, sashimi and of course miso soup. Then, I get a big cheesy smile on my face when I see how cheap my total order is. I receive an email letting me know my order is ready and my husband will stop by on his way home and pick up our dinner. Everything comes packaged neatly (nothing like how take-out usually looks) and of course the food is yummy and I don't have to wash dishes at the end!!
