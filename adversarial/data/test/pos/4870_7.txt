Alright, so it's been five years. Time for an update. Same overpriced mediocre crap. Thank heavens for Amazon. Now they sell horrible unlicensed( i assume) artwork portraying pop culture figures and musicians. Don't mess with Disney, dudes, they'll take everything you have.\n\n I think i've bought maybe three things here over fifteen years.
