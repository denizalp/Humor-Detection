At some point it becomes academic as you find yourself in a \"Oh, my god, you HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS\" pissing contest with your spouse over who ordered best. \nYou want her envious. \nYou want her to say those sweet sounding words, \"I should have gotten what you ordered...what was I thinking\" firmly putting you back on top in the who knows best department. At least when it comes to Mexican food.\nSadly however, her meal is equally as good. \nYou've got nothing.\nFuck.\n\nThe smug little smirk and shrug saying; \"Yeah, well, I tried to tell ya\" will have to wait for another day, another restaurant.\n\nDamn you LaCanasta for being so good.
