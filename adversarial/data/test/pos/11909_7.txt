Great Pie\n\nI am a big fan of quality pizza and it has been awhile since I've eaten at Brothers Pizza, so I thought it was about time to visit Brothers once again.  Brothers specializes in New York Style Pizza. Brothers offers a great variety of toppings and specialty pizzas that are well-worth checking out. \n\nOn this visit I ordered a Large Pepperoni Pizza and 20 wings.  The pizza was piping hot, had a great doughy crust, flavorful sauce, right amount of pepperoni, and was quite delicious as were the wings.\n\nThe service at Brothers has always been prompt and friendly. Try to head there during non-peak times as I have noticed their busiest times are from about 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm but always worth the wait.
