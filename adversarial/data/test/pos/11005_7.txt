24 hour fedex and copy location. Visited for a package delivery and cost $13 to ship a book and cd. If these items weren't personalized with a message to the recipient, I would have just shipped new items from amazon and it would have been the same or cheaper. Yes, that was the cheapest 7 day shipping possible :(\n\nI can say that the items did arrive without any significant incidents or events.\n\nThey are also a Kinkos copy center to make copies of stuff and purchase office supplies. If you need this stuff late night, they're open and waiting for you.
